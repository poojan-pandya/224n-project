I told my mom she was being a huge asshole and that she needs to apologize. Of course she said no, and that I was being rude and uncalled for, and that my sister needed to know the truth.

36058,45386,"AITA for refusing to help my Fiance' clean up garbage all over the backyard?. Brief backstory: been together for 5 & a half years with my Fiance', Maddie. We're both 25. We've been living together for a full 4 years now. We rarely fight and have a really good system for housework, chores, errands etc that feels fair to both of us. One constant (very small) strain is that Maddie always seems to half-complete something, resulting in me having to finish it for her later. Really minor stuff. Some examples to give context:


* Putting empty bottles back in the medicine cabinet instead of throwing them away
* Leaving wrappers / tissues laying around the house i.e. on her nightstand, dresser instead of throwing them away
* When doing the dishes she'll sometimes leave big items ""to soak"" instead of just cleaning them properly. Last weekend she left a crockpot to soak for 3 days when I was away - I had to clean it when I got back.


Little things like that. She knows it bothers me and she's actively working on improving, which is nice (yay communication). Onto the story itself: Thursday last week I was getting ready to leave for the weekend and wouldn't be home until Saturday. She took the garbage out, however instead of taking it to the back shed she just set it on the back deck, which we both know not to do as raccoons will get into it. I nicely asked her to take it to the shed and she said she would.

I get home mid-afternoon Saturday and there's now two bags of garbage on the back deck. Luckily no animals got into them yet. I kindly asked again that she take them to the back shed and let her know if any animals get into them I am **not** helping to clean it up. She agreed. I then had to leave again until Sunday afternoon when I returned home. The backyard was covered in garbage and I let her know. She asked for help cleaning it up and I refused. It took her at least half an hour of picking up dirty, wet garbage (it had rained). She said she understands why I did it, but she feels that I was being cruel and unnecessarily mean to prove a point.


Was I the asshole here?. Am I the asshole?","NTA. 

I'm exactly like Maddie (I too, love to let things soak... Not for 3 days though) but I'd fully understand if something like this happened that I'd be the one to clean it up. Actually, I'd probably try to clean it up before you got home because I wouldn't want you to be able to say 'I told you so'

Maybe next time she'll take the trash into the shed to avoid this happening. Having to deal with consequences is the best motivator to prevent them from happening next time haha",0,0,0,0,1
4969,6316,"AITA for telling my boyfriend he needs to go see a doctor because he asked me to get blackout drunk so he could have sex with me while I'm passed out.. My boyfriend and I have been together for over 5 years and we get along really well. However, his I've been concerned with his porn habits for a while. I've found porn he's bookmarked on his computer while using it and I've found hundreds of videos of things forced porn, girls being tied up and gangbanged and videos where the girls are drugged up or unconscious. I've confronted him about it and he told me that it was simply a fetish but last week he asked me if I could get blackout drunk so he could have sleep while I'm unconscious. 
I was really creeped out, refused and told him I find his habits disturbing and he should go find professional help. We haven't talked very much since, but I'm worried by the fact that he's trying to fulfill his fantasies in real life and that he might try to make me do many of the things that he watches in the videos.

37011,46559,"AITA for not letting my wife touch the thermostat?. My wife, myself and our son moved to a new house in August. We occupy the top half and there are tenants in the lower half. I don't own the house, we both rent but the thermostat control is upstairs. I moved in a few weeks before my partner and our kid because of the way our schedules worked. I have programmed many-a-thermostat for work and at homes. When I moved in I read the manual and I explored the programming and now that it's winter I have it set to 21 degrees Celsius. 

When my partner got here she immediately began pushing buttons and undid my programming. She admittingly said she had no idea what she was doing and ended up setting it to 16. I told her I would gladly show her how to program it and gave her the manual to read. She has done neither. I reset the thermostat and a few days later she started hitting buttons again, this time setting it to 28. I told her I didn't want her touching it unless she read the manual or had me show her how to set it up, these extreme fluctuations waste a lot of energy. Now there's a sensor in the basement and the thermostat averages the 2 temperatures to decide whether to turn on or not and the people living downstairs have several space heaters so the thermostat thinks the houses average temperature is warmer than it should be. I told the tenants downstairs that I would gladly turn the heat up if they wanted to turn off their space heaters and they declined so I disconnected the sensor downstairs so the thermostat would accurately reflect the temperature upstairs. They are aware of this and we can turn the sensor back on at any time. This is why the temperature upstairs was not reflective of my programming and why my wife felt the need to turn it up to 28 previously. 

 All has been good for the last month until my MIL came to visit. I get along really well with her but she is very controlling about her space (totally respect that) but has shown up and started immediately messing with the thermostat, again it has fluctuated between 16 and 26 in the 3 days since she has been here. It bothered me but I decided to stay out of it and let her do her thing while she is here and I will reset it on Tuesday. She asked my wife how to set it up and she said she is not allowed to.

Let me preface this by saying that I don’t mess with marijuana. It doesn’t bother me that she does, I just don’t. 

At the start of our road trip she mentioned to me that she brought a little marijuana. I said that I think it’s inconsiderate to me to do that because it’s an arrestable misdemeanor in this state and if we got pulled over it could become a big deal for me and her on this trip. Driving through our home state is about half the trip. She said it’s her vacation too and that she was annoyed. I get that it’s her trip too...

34380,43355,"AITA for not singing at church?. I hate singing.  I almost never do it.  I sang lullabies to my kids when they were little, and I sing the birthday song at birthday parties.  But, other than that, I rarely sing except as a joke.  (Singing badly to troll my now teenage kids.)  It just isn't my thing.  I don't like the sound of my own voice and singing brings me no joy at all.

This has caused a small fight with my wife.  We go to church every Sunday.  As with most churches, they sing a half dozen songs before the service starts.  At our current church, everyone stands while singing.  I am respectful and stand along with everyone else, but I don't sing along with them.  This church shows the lyrics on a large screen so nobody is required to hold a hymn book, but at previous churches where they sang out of the books, I would also hold the hymn books and follow along in my head, but would not sing.

My wife thinks I am being disrespectful by not singing.  I feel I am being respectful by standing with everyone else, opening the hymn book to the right songs when at that church, and generally following along and being part of the  service EXCEPT for the actual singing.

Nobody has ever said anything to us.  It isn't like we've gotten complaints about my not singing.

51992,65247,"AITA for not standing up for my girlfriend?. Here's the backstory: I was very stupid and cheated on my ex-girlfriend with my current girlfriend. (I know I'm the asshole for this, this isn't the part I'm asking for judgment on, however.) I apologized and made amends with my ex as best as I could, and she's a very kind person so we are on good terms (not exactly friends, but friendly and civil when we need to be around each other.) As for my current girlfriend, the cheating wasn't a fling, I really fell hard for this girl and we've been together about a year now. Understandably, a lot of friends were upset when this happened, and still are even though it was a year ago.

Two months from now, two of my very close friends are getting married. These friends are good friends with my ex and not so much with my current gf. So they basically asked me not to bring my current gf since they're still is upset at her for what happened and my ex will also be there. I said that's fine, she's not close to the couple, I didn't expect to bring her anyway. I do think it kinda sucks that all of our (my and current gf's) mutual friend will be their with their SO's, but it's not my call who gets invited.

Well, my girlfriend got upset when she found out and said that I was basically throwing her under the bus for this. I asked her why she would want to go to a wedding where she wasn't wanted anyway and she said it wasn't about wanting to go, it was about me not sticking up for her when the couple talked me. I didn't want to start drama with my friends or add to their stress when they're getting married, and while I do want my gf there I don't think I'll change their minds about her.

Dude come on, you are letting your current GF take the fall for something that is really your fault. You both were involved with cheating but its YOU who ruined the friend group dynamic.

The problem is: besides me, another 3 friends know about the affair, but haven’t done anything. Me and my best friend tried to convince Sally to end things with Evan before Sophie finds out. She said she would but we don’t believe her because she’s had a crush on Evan for a reallyyy long time and we know this kind of feeling doesn’t go away overnight.

We just celebrated the birth of our son slightly under 2 months ago after moving thousands of miles away from our original home. I don't have a ""sterotypical"" military job (its office work), but i still have to do military things like mandatory meetings after hours, and working out any designated time between 730 am to 430 pm, mon-fri. (Its a sweet gig, not complaining)

We only have 1 income, I don't make a lot but i try to have food in the fridge that can be cooked.

But my baby is a baby that sleeps a lot. Yes, baby wakes up through night and has to be fed, and my wife takes care of that, but baby still sleeps afterwards and throughout the day.

52980,66484,"WIBTA If I Told My Brother Not To Come To A Football Game. My family owns season tickets for our local NFL team, and we rotate who gets the tickets every season.

25565,32331,"WIBTA for inviting my SIL and her family up for the holidays but not my FIL and step-MIL?. A little background: my mother-in-law passed away just over 2 years ago. I was extremely lucky in that I had a wonderful relationship with her. I loved her very much, she loved me, and I miss her terribly. It was a very difficult time for my husband and sister-in-law, they were a very close family, so it's something they are still dealing with. 

My father-in-law got remarried very quickly, and he has now been married to his new wife for a year. She is...okay. She's nice enough, tries to be friendly with all of us, but she has a personality that just doesn't mesh well, and she has a habit of stepping on toes. She has tried way too hard to step into a ""mother"" role to my husband and SIL, and ""grandmother"" role to my SIL's kids, while they are still grieving the loss of their mom, so it has rubbed everyone the wrong way. There are a lot of other little things, like moving into their childhood home and getting rid of all photos of their mom without offering them to the kids, that have put a strain on that relationship. 

The other element at play here is that ever since he got remarried, my FIL has been very disengaged from our lives when he was once super involved. He doesn't call, doesn't make much effort to see his grandkids, and spends much more time with his new wife's kids and her grandkids. For the record, I don't think step-MIL is actively trying to push FIL to spend less time with us, it just seems that she dictates how they spend their time and he just goes along with it, so this is on him. This has been especially difficult on my SIL, who is tremendously hurt at how little her dad seems to care about her kids.

This all leads me to the holidays. The holidays have been very tough since my MIL passed away. Especially since step-MIL takes them VERY seriously. She's quite religious (Christian) while my husband, SIL, and I are all agnostic Jews. SIL's husband is agnostic as well. 

My husband and I are planning to spend the holidays out of state with my family this year. My mom suggested inviting my SIL and her family to join us, since she is aware of the circumstances and how difficult it would be for SIL to spend the holidays with step-MIL, especially without my husband and I there.

29223,36922,"AITA for expecting intimate pictures/conversations from my wife?.   

So my wife(23F) and I(24M) have a bit of a conflict regarding sexual conversations and pictures. I want them and she is not super comfortable with them. Early on in our relationship we would have very intimate conversations because we were both virgins and had no idea what we were really talking about, however, now that we are married and have experienced sex, conversations like that don't exist anymore and she feels really uncomfortable with it because it's not realistic compared to what we would actually do. 

Now I wouldn't have a problem with this setup because I'd rather just have sex, but I am in the military and I'm just finishing up a 6 month TDY away from her. Over the 6 months she's sent me a few pictures of the same pose and no sexual conversations. I have a very overwhelming sex drive and my primary reasoning for expecting more from her is because I get tempting into pornography, which not only goes against my religious beliefs, but I have also seen the negative side-affects it can have on a person and I'd prefer to stay away.

My personal feelings on this are like this; I feel bad for expecting more from her because I don't want to put her in a position where she feels awkward or uncomfortable, however, it's extremely hard for me to abstain from any sexual acts for 6+ months at a time and I'd really prefer if she could just get into it like we used to and where revealing clothing, try different poses, have sexy conversations, etc.

46263,58083,"AITA for not following a disabled customer’s ridiculous standards?. I work as a barista and shift manager at a local coffee shop. I have a regular customer who has an autoimmune disorder as well as OCD, and she makes this known every time she comes in. She usually orders 2-4 drinks and requests the following:

-	All steaming pitchers, espresso cups, blenders, etc. that are required to make her drinks need to be fully washed, rinsed, and sanitized no matter how recently they were cleaned: if she didn’t watch us do it, it didn’t happen.
-	Any ice that we use needs to be scooped from the back right hand corner of the ice machine.
-	Cups have to be taken from the middle of the stack.
-	She has to watch us do all of this. She will sit there and stare at us and make sure we follow her rules to a T. If we do it and she doesn’t see it, we have to remake her drinks. This can be problematic because we start making drinks while the customer is ordering, so she isn’t always watching or paying attention while we make them.

Earlier today I was working on drinks while a coworker ran the register. We had a line of about eight people behind her. I made her drinks as quickly as I could, conforming to her standards, and she demanded that because she wasn’t watching that I had to remake her drinks. I did it, but told her in the future that we can’t just remake drinks that have nothing wrong with them.

It's a long story, but basically my mom is a drug addict who's behavior is off the wall. She's a pathological liar and a thief. Whenever she doesn't get her way, she becomes extremely cruel and vindictive and will say or do anything she can to hurt other people. Growing up she would frequently call me all kinds of horrible names, make threats of violence against me and my family, tell me that she wishes she had aborted me, and so on. She ruins every occasion, because everywhere she goes she creates drama. And if you try to confront her about anything she does, she plays the victim

My family knows all of this, but enables her behavior because they feel sorry for her. Even now that I'm an adult, they keep pushing me to spend time with her but I'm done. I'm tired of putting up with her behavior and having everything ruined by her.

So I have found out a lot about my heritage going after church records and tracing family names and some other legal documents but the trails become ambiguous 4-5 generations back. I know we have extended family only 2 generations removed that we have stopped talking to due to very inconsistent interactions and the fact that my parents moved to another continent when I was just starting school.

I have done a genetic test on myself and have some interesting results but they could be even more informational with a lot of the family getting their tests done too. I want to pay for all of them.

Is it wrong to ask them to do this? I've talked to one of my brothers and he insisted that just doing the test on myself compromises the health insurance of other family members. He told me the laws are so inconsistent from state to state that third parties can often get access to information that is supposed to be entirely private and insurance providers can even discriminate without getting into any legal trouble. I joked that I could take his saliva and do the test but he didn't find that funny.

He then also got in a huff saying that I basically sold half his DNA to any corporation that wants to know intimate details about him and I had no right to do that considering all the unprotected legal limbo genetic test results are in right now. He is very privacy conscious but it did not occur to me that he could take this so personally. 

He also said that tracing heritage is one thing and getting biographical information on family we've had contact with can be interesting. Finding cousins we have never met or even further removed extended family is nearly meaningless and not a good reason to get a genetic test.

I honestly couldn't care less about them not being together because their relationship was volatile and unstable. I lived with my mother until I was 17 and was kicked out. My father offered for me and my other siblings to come to live with him. My mother was very violent and agreed to let him have custody. This background is really important because living with my mother meant I didn't have any semblance of a relationship with my father for over 10 years.

I lived with my dad until I turned 19 and then quickly moved out because our relationship turned emotionally abusive.

So I've been in a relationship with this girl for about 3 years and in these 3 years we've had many fights because she decided to make a bunch of piercings and tattoos in which some of them I only knew did. Some of those piercings I liked and others I didn't which is normal. 

The problem is that every time I say that I don't like something she makes, she starts rambling about how I don't support her decisions and that I'm a control freak. This turned way worst after she decided that she wanted to tatto a anime character in the arm. I said since the begging that I was against because I never liked those kind of tattos,either way she did it and obviously I didn't like and we had major fights because for her I had to support every single decision that she made.

But when I make a decision without her consent she freaks out and tells me that I need to do better in this relationship because I don't care about he opinions, I cannot even have my own friends without her starting to say shit about them and telling me that I should get better friends. 


Now she told me that she wants to do another anime character in the other arm, my response was that I cannot date a person that my opinion but whats me to do only what she approves. 

I told her that if she makes another tatto of a anime character, I'll break up with her. She went nuts and is saying that I'm a control freak. I need help am I wrong? 

I'm not against piercings nor tattos because I have a tatto and a piercing so that's not the issue.

So today I set in one of these cars after a long day of work and behind me sat a group of families- 3 mothers and 4 boys which was around 10 y.o.
They made a lot of noise at the begging of the ride so I told one of the moms ""can you please be more quite"" and she told her boys ""stop"" and ""be quiet"".
After maybe 2 mins they began screaming again and people started to leave the car. 15 mins into the ride a couple heads up to them and tells them that they can't make much noise in this car as this is a quiet car"" then her bf told one of the moms ""you don't care people keep constantly leaving this car because of your noise"" which one of the moms replied with ""it's obvious that they dont have any children"". Moving on- people kept leaving and some asked them to be quite with no success. At some point one of the kids farted and made the whole car smell like shit and the moms saw it as a joke. After 30 mins I had enough so I turned around and told them ""can you shut the f*** up"" and then one of them replied to me ""you know what, no, we can't, boys come on sing as loud as you can"" so I told her you dont care that a lot of people left because of your behaviour? and she replied with ""no if you dont like it then leave"" so I told her ""I dont need to leave there's only one wagon like this in the whole train you should f***ing move to one of the others, you told them to stop like 10 times and it didn't help so saying it again won't make an impact.

All of my bridesmaids are friends that I have had for years. While we were planning, we threw around the idea of having it 9 hours away. I ran the idea by them to get their opinions before we settled on anything. I asked them what they thought, if they were comfortable with it, and okay with the extra costs of traveling and staying at a place there. I listed out all of the cost they would be responsible for berfore hand, which is $50 for their dresses and $140 TOTAL for a hotel room for 3 nights. This is all they would have to pay for the whole shabang.

I told them that they would not have to pay their rooming fees until the day before we checked in to give them time to gradually put aside money. 

A few weeks ago one of my bridesmaids contacted me saying she was going to be unable to pay for her room besides $50 of it that she is asking the other 6 girls to spilt between them because she just took out loans for school, is paying rent/utilities, and her gas to drive down there is too much but she really wanted to still go. I told her I understood and that these things happen & I would take out the money from my paycheck and set it aside for her and I would cut back on some things to make it work for her. She seemed really embarrassed and apologized for even asking. 

These past few weeks IMMEDIATELY after I agreed to pay for $90 of her room (on top of everything else i’m paying for myself) she posts pictures of her buying outfits from a fancy boutique, getting her nails done every week, and constantly going out clubbing and staying in hotels. She does this often, which is why it surprised me when she asked for money. It rubs me the wrong way that she’s spending all of this money on trivial items & then asking me and my other bridesmaids to foot her bill. It comes off disrespectful and that my wedding isn’t important enough for her to save $140 over 6 months. I talked to my fiancé about confronting her but he said I shouldn’t since I already agreed to pay it and shouldn’t be petty and throw it in her face.

I am male, 17 - (18 in August) and my girlfriend is 17,(also 18 in August). 

The other day I had her over at my house and we were just watching some TV in my room. Things led to another and we started making out, me on top of her, etc. I am not allowed to have girls in my room with the door closed and I was alright with that rule. I had my door about halfway open and I didn’t see but suddenly my door slammed all the way open so I threw myself off of her. I felt really embarrassed and bad, and I think she did too.

A little later, I took her home. When I came back my mother said “I don’t think you should have girls in your room anymore.” At the time I was still embarrassed so I just let it slide but the more I thought about it I got more upset.

When I came home later that night my family was playing games and i just went back to my room and my sister asked, “Aren’t you going to join?” and my dad responded with, “He’s probably going to clean his sheets now.” I’m not sure why but that really threw me over the edge and i just locked myself in my room for the rest of the night. I am afraid to face any of them because I feel like they’re just going to ridicule me more.

My siblings and parents have told me multiple times that I am “a grown ass man” and they use that often, except when it comes to me being my own person. I have also proven myself to be safe and smart when it comes to being sexually active.

At first I thought he was nice. He brought me and my mother to events I would never have gone to anyways. He bought me and my mother a couple of stuff. Im pretty sure he got me my Xbox 360 and a few games, and always got my mom some jewelry or clothing. I thought nothing of this since I was in middle school.

Fast forward to high school. I notice that some things are a bit off. Simple tasks, like ordering stuff online and buying drinks and food, he tells my mom to do. While shes busy with other stuff. It escalates to her helping him with his so called job. And I say so called cause I still dont know what it is. Buying envelopes, making phone calls, and helping with the money. 

He regularly uses drugs at this point, everyday. Stinks up the house. Every simple task he never does and orders my mom to do it for him. I think he uses her to be more and more lazy. Every time he brings his kids from his ex-wifes house, me and my mom HAVE to take care of them. He leaves the house in a mess. Full sink. Doesnt take trash out or the recycling. I dont know what bills he pays for even. Argues with her, and even yelling at her if she doesnt do what he asks for.

I start to hate him more and more. Right now, he has been kicked out the house 3 times. 3 fucking times. Last time he came back, my mother said she brought him back to ""kill him with kindness.""
She keeps bringing him back, defending his actions. Even after I offer her help. At this point Im fed up with my moms actions and still do. I see no point in being in the household and with her, him.

Last week I brought up that I hadn't gotten a sign-up email yet for the team, only to be told that I lost my spot to a free agent they picked up from a different team in the league.


I'll admit I am probably one of the worse players on the team, but I can still keep up just fine. I also have a good attitude when it comes to letting the better players have more time than me, especially when the game is close. I only really come to hang out with guys and have fun. Its rec basketball for fucks sake! Not to mention last year and every year before that we've made it to the finals and lost, so its not like I am pulling us down.


Regardless of my skill level, or how good the team is, I think this is an incredibly shitty thing to do. The whole situation has me rethinking whether or not they are even really my friends. I haven't spoken to them in two days because of this, after calling them dickheads initially and ranting for about 5 minutes about how shitty that makes me feel. A few of them thought this was an overreaction, and that if I want to play so bad I should just, ""make a new team"".


To be completely honest, I think the thing that is making me the most angry is that they didn't even have the guts to tell me I was replaced, I had to find out myself and look like an idiot. In any event, who is the real asshole here?

I don't eat fruits, vegetables, or other non-safe foods and I generally have very specific requirements for what I will eat.

All of this basically makes it impossible for me to eat the same things as my family. When we eat we usually just put stuff on the table and everyone takes what they want. So my parents will prepare a normal meal and then maybe a little bit of pasta with the understanding that that's what I'm going to eat even though it's not specifically labled as ""mine"".

Sometimes what happens is that someone else will help themselves to ""my"" food even when I'm not done with it.

25597,32375,"AITA for wanting someone else to pray. My dad's side of the family is Mormon, and while my dad is somewhat ok with me leaving the church, my aunts and uncles are definitely not ok with it.

My dad's family is Mormon and Polynesian, so there's 50 cousins, at the very least, in the state and since I have been doing well for myself and my family and have recently bought a really nice house we had my cousin's birthday party at my place yesterday. Throughout the day I heard my aunts and uncles saying *""they only have this nice house because Satan has them in his grasp""* and *""this house is only temporal, but her sadness from leaving the gospel will be eternal""* and I will be honest these little digs may have added to what I did.

So before we ate the food my SO made my aunt, who is the fahu (oldest sister on my dad's side and should receive the highest levels of respect and obedience), decided that after I told everyone thanks for coming to celebrate my cousin's birthday and to enjoy the food she would give a speech and turn the eating into a little family home evening. Meaning there would be an opening prayer, a hymn, a lesson (which so happened to be on Joseph Smith and his first vision, one of the reasons I left their church), and a closing prayer.

I didn't mind her doing this, I kind of expected it, but then she asked me to say the closing prayer. She's knows that I am no longer a member and don't believe in God. I said that she wouldn't like the prayer I would give and should ask someone else to do it. She pressed on and on about me saying the prayer and I finally said ""This is my house and I'd like to ask uncle\_\_\_ to bless the food and give the closing prayer.""

My favorite uncle told her to let it go and that he would bless the food. The rest of the night was kind of awkward and ended earlier than usual. I have been getting texts from my cousins saying I was a dick and there's been a lot of passive aggressive FB posts.

I feel like I should've just said the prayer since my fahu was the one to ask, and since I don't believe what's the harm in praying?

And this PC wasn’t cheap. I don’t remember how much did it cost but it was considerably expensive. I told her that it was too much money for a gift to a kid. And this started an argument.

My problems with this are two. 1: I don’t want my kid to be a spoiled kid, sure he has been good at school but he hasn’t really worked for it, not even in a symbolic way. I’m afraid that he will believe that his mother will buy him all he wants without working. 2: This is also something bad for my relationship with my kid.

My friends agreed to come and then remembered they both needed to be back in our home town by 12 on Sunday morning, meaning we would have to leave at the latest at 7AM the morning after the wedding.

21225,26960,"AITA for thinking it's only fair to take turns with the nice car?.   

I am still having a friendly debate with my parents and brother about something that happened years ago that I'd like your opinion. My older brother and I shared a car when we were younger, purchased by my parents. It was a used car, nothing fancy, but looked nice and was in good shape. 

When he left for college, I was still at home and my parents decided I should keep the car at home to get to school and my activities. When it was time for me to go to college, it was his turn for the car since I been using it at home for a while. I also wanted a car at college so I could have the ability to drive home on occasional weekends. So I used my savings that I had earned through three years of part-time jobs to buy a car. All I had was $900, so you can imagine what the car looked like. It had no paint (just primer), and had over 150,000 miles on it. It was a true piece of junk but it was still running.

Fast forward a year. It was my turn for the car my parents had bought for us. Instead of selling the clunker, I offered to let my brother use it, no cost to him. Well, my parents decided that my brother should continue to drive the nicer car and I should continue to drive the clunker since it was mine. No more alternating use of the nicer car. I felt like I was essentially being punished for working hard and buying my own car. If I had spent that money on CD's (showing my age, lol) or clothes, I would have been able to continue to share the nicer car. So I didn't understand why this was different. Thoughts?

20249,25768,"AITA for not letting my mom bring her new boyfriend to my wedding?. New account to retain anonymity.

Two months ago my (F/31) mom was dumped by her longterm partner. They were together for around 10 years. It sucked, and I tried to be there for her as best I could (we live in different countries). This happened three months before my wedding. Her life partner had been invited of course, but I struck him off the guest list after this.

Less than two weeks later she messages me to tell me all about her new boyfriend. Not gonna lie, I was a bit surprised, but nothing wrong with a lil' rebound if that's what she needs. Problem is, she immediately asked if she could bring him to the wedding.

Am I the asshole for gently telling her no?

We've been pretty strict with our single friends about not bringing brand new dates to our wedding because we want to keep it intimate. One of my worst nightmares is being surrounded by a sea of strangers' faces at my wedding--I'm an aspie and can struggle to connect with strangers. I just don't want to be an outsider at my own wedding, ya know?

But here's my mom, making this request after dating this man for a couple days max. Because she's the mother of the bride, her date will automatically be close to the wedding party. I'll have this complete stranger hanging around me on my special day. Do people really expect to get a wedding invitation for their plus one when they've only known them for a few days?

On the other hand, a couple family members on my mom's side say I'm being unfair. Understandably, they pointed out that she's going through a hard time and to add to the sting, she'll have to show up to her daughter's wedding single, while her ex-husband (my dad) is there with his happy family (he's been happily remarried with a kid for 13 years now). It's also been pointed out to me that she has to travel pretty far (from Germany to Scotland) and spend a whole weekend at the venue (we're having a weekend wedding with on-site accommodation, because half of our guests are international). I don't feel tooooooo much sympathy for the travel part, because for the past 12 years I've been flying that route 1-2 times a year to come visit her--a courtesy she has never returned. And all my other German family members will be there, so it's not like she'll be alone.

One final note, though this transpired AFTER I had already refused her request: her new boyfriend is currently being flakey and isn't sure whether he wants to commit to a relationship, because his ex-girlfriend rocked up and decided she wants him back. He is ""confused"" and needs to ""sort his feelings"".

So, what do you think? Should I have let her invite her new boyfriend? Am I thinking too mechanically and should employ a little more empathy? Am I an asshole in this situation?. Am I the asshole?","Nta. It's unreasonable to expect something like that.

Yesterday the whole house is up at 6 AM (my brother & his 4 kids live with me & my mom because of personal reasons) I didn't know they were going anywhere so I was immediately envious when I asked my brother what was up & he said they're all going to an amusement park. By everyone I mean my brother, his 2 oldest kids, his father & the other family on his side.

So now me & my mom are watching the two youngest kids ALL DAY because they didn't take them. From 6 AM to 10 PM, & it kinda sucked knowing everyone was having fun without us & that we were stuck babysitting.

After everyone finally comes home, they're all telling us about how fun it was & are showing us videos. I noticed how many family members went so I mentioned it & they said it was a family only thing (implying we weren't considered family... Even if we grew up together & go to family events/holiday parties together...) I was still annoyed so I said sarcastically ""it's nice how everyone else got to go have fun while we stayed here watching the babies. We didn't even get an invite."" 

This made everyone super tense because it was true. Then they started to try making excuses like ""it was only for family, we paid for it, etc"" & even brought up how me & my mom went on a cruise in July. however, we INVITED everyone we knew, they declined because they didn't have the money. In this situation they didn't even inform us & actively excluded us from it.

Not to mention how we're considered family when they need something from us (my brothers father used to live with us for a while, & we've given him money multiple times) but suddenly we're not family when it's a fun day out...

So AITA for calling them out in this situation or is my anger & jealousy justified considering how they excluded us?

I've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.

Until this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. 

The drive home is where my memory cuts out. 

Next thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.

Honestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know.

I used to not mind furries as long as they kept their kinks to themselves.

But then I recently found a subreddit called yiffinhell and it really opened my eyes to the truth about furries. They claim it's a family-friendly fandom where inclusion and expression is valued above all but really it's a cesspool of toxicity and sexuality.

Furthermore, Discord admins are furries and got outed for liking cub porn. The backlash was real. The tea was HOT.

And recently I heard that many furry conventions are allowing a known and convicted ""MAP"" or whatever the hell you call them (what they did was almost 20 years ago but still) to attend and even host an all ages panel.

My disdain for furries has skyrocketed and I want to disassociate with all of them and create a virtual restraining order for myself where no furries are allowed within 3m of me.

I told the main admin about my feelings and showed him yiffinhell but he told me that everyone is welcome and as long as they don't do degenerate shit on the server itself they're welcome with open arms. And that yiffinhell shows only the worst of the fandom but it's a minority.

I don't believe that. Having thousands of posts showing how bad the community is shows that at least a good half of the furry fandom is just pure utter shit. And there's no subs showing nearly how bad the anime fandom is presumed to be.

6012,7672,"AITA For refusing to pay for a custom item that I may have been misled on pricewise?. Hi all, I need to know if I'm the asshole.

I am looking for a simple slab of wood that I can use a desktop when placed upon some sort of support (ex. filing cabinets). In early March I contacted a freelance woodworker on Craigslist who said that they could make a desktop to match my specifications (6' x 18'"" x 1""). This is what happened:

-I very explicitly stated that before moving forward, I wanted to know how much the piece of wood would cost. They said, ""It kinda of depends on how long it will take to sand it down. As it is now $60."" They asked me if I wanted a gloss coat, and I said yes. They said it would be ready in early April.

-I contacted them today asking how the progress was going and they said it would be ready by Monday. I asked them how much the total cost would be. Given the only amount of money they had disclosed to me cost-wise was $60, I assumed it wouldn't deviate too much from that. Instead, they were asking for $300 (all for a 6' x 18'"" x 1"" piece of wood). 

-I said: ""I see. You said in an earlier message that it would be around $60-$100. If you look at the initial messages I sent you on March 10th, you stated that. Was there something I missed?""

-They said: ""I said 60 for the 6 by 18 as it was, Without any work put into it. Then I asked if you wanted it sanded and glossed it would all depend on how many hours was put into it and the quality of the finished product. If you buy any type of wood for furniture and it is a finished product it will be pricey not to mention custom made.""

-I said: ""Clearly I have never  bought anything of this sort before, I feel like an idiot. It would have been nice to have had a final price estimate based upon what I asked for, but that was my fault for not being explicit.""

-They said: ""I wouldn't have been able to give you an accurate price because I didn't know how much work needed to be put into it.""

-It went back and forth like this, and I argued that they should have been straightforward with their pricing, while they argued that I should have asked all the questions I could before allowing them to go off and prepare the wood.

-Since I didn't sign a contract, I told him I simply couldn't afford it and cut all contact.

It all just seems very strange to me; what kind of businessperson withholds pricing info and then goes off to make the product without knowing that the customer will be willing to pay the final amount?

My mother is 60 years old, and works two full time jobs... She was severely screwed out of the divorce with my father and it's really just a nasty situation. The woman really works her butt off.

I know that weekend weddings are much more convenient, but this is something we really want to do, so reddit, WIBTA for having my wedding on a Tuesday?

EDIT: We're planning on having a pretty small wedding, only close friends and family. And while it would require travelling, we're still saving up money for it, so we plan on informing people 6-12 months in advance.

EDIT 2: After reading your comments together, my fiance and I are reconsidering the venue. We're thinking about having it closer to home, since pretty much all of our friends and family live in the same city. It'd only be 2/2.5 hour drive away from said city, heavily reducing travelling costs for our guests. Does this better the situation?. Am I the asshole?","NTA, as long as you are not even slightly irritated when people can't come. Expect a low turnout.

RE your edit: You're still asking people to take two days off, since most people won't be driving home two hours after drinking at a wedding. So you're saying now, drive down either the night before or the day of the wedding, stay the day of the wedding, drive back the day after. That's still a burden.

There's nothing wrong with having your wedding at the venue and on the date you want. You just don't have the right to feel entitled to everyone showing up. Any wedding has tradeoffs like that.

The company was bought out a while ago, and since then, they've been ""restructuring"" and dumping additional duties on the people in my department. No extra pay, and honestly the pay is pretty low comparable to what we could get in the area for similar work. Because of the low rate, they're having trouble finding more people to hire. They can't even find people to interview, honestly.

I absolutely love my boss and the people I work with, I just hate the work itself now that they've added all of these other things on.

54286,68172,"AITA for demanding my coworker pays me $100 for a bet?. Context: coworker (27m) and I (29f) are friends at work and outside of work. Our outside of work shenanigans typically circle around copious amounts of alcohol (long islands, to be exact). I'm an avid bowler, he likes the pitchers of beer at the bowling alley.

Stage: Sometime around midnight. 4+ hours of drinking. Group of his friends and my financée. Bowling. I had just bowled the first ball of a frame and was left with a 6-7-10 split. (one pin on the far left, two pins on the far right). While it's not impossible to pick this up, it is rather difficult. Especially mixed with alcohol, flashing lights, loud music, and a dark bowling alley.

CW: coworker ME: me

CW: ""Bet you $100 you can't pick that up.""

ME: ""Okay. But what happens if I don't pick it up?""

CW: ""Nothing. You don't get $100.""

ME: ""Deal.""

\*Shakes\*

I picked up the split. Did a happy dance. Kissed the fiancée. ""Pay up, buckaroo."" He proceeds to try to use the WellsFargo app to send money via Zelle. I watch him try a few times and it fails for some unknown reason. Okay. I'll see him Monday and we'll try then.

A little later, we were on probably the 6th or 7th frame of a game and he bets me another $100 that I won't score higher than a 200. I was confident in myself that I would not be able to reach 200 in that game as more than half of it was already done and I was pretty sloppy due to a copious amount of alcohol by this time. There's still about 20-30 (he says 40) minutes left of bowling before they turn the lights on to kick us out. We never shook on the bet, but I did say I would try to beat a 200 score.

Well, low and behold, they turn the lights on at about the 7th frame of the next game (I wouldn't have been able to get over 200 anyways) and I was unable to finish the game. So minus the fact that I didn't shake on it, the bet is void as not enough time was given for me to finish.

So coworker now thinks that because that bet was not completed, he doesn't owe me the first $100 from the split pickup. He said he will gladly go bowling with me again so I can properly try to score above 200 and finish the bet. But I believe that since the first bet was easy, clean, and completed, he still owes me $100. I'll take him up on his offer to get the second $100 by beating 200 sometime.

So this man (M) calls while we were slammed, and my co worker (CW) answered the call after having multiple calls on hold. I hear her explaining that she was sorry for having M on hold and explained there was only two of us. CW then asks me how to find an order from a previous day. I explain how to find it and ask what the problem is. CW explains that M called and said he had placed an order last week and it was messed up and so we promised him a free pizza next order. He claimed that he came into the store and ordered a delivery for his son, which was weird because we usually take deliveries over the phone. CW asked M for the phone number, name, or even address that we could find his order on, and nothing came up. So we go to the day and there were three deliveries that day. Two for a business we catered two, and one other small delivery to another business. CW then reads out the addresses and tells M that none are the address he gave us. M then says its the last address, and that we should've asked for the delivery address and not his. At this point I was getting skeptical because on that record there was no complaint and the order to that address was for a woman at a business. I got sidetracked with other customers and when I came back I saw that CW had taken the delivery and that she had comped it. When I asked why she said she didn't wanna fight with him anymore, so she just agreed to send it. Thats when I took the slip with the phone number and I took it to the office. I was not going to send a driver for a free delivery for a fix, of a record I could not find. 

I then call M and explain that since his claimed order was to a business, then he would have to order a remake to the business, and not to his house. I explained nicely he could email the owner and figure this out. M then proceeded to go off on me and call me immature and said I was probably a stupid kid (again, I'm 19) and said he would be coming in to speak to the owner about my behavior.

2293,2845,"AITA for not passing a turning vehicle?. I'm thinking the other driver is an asshole, but maybe I was actually in the wrong?

I was driving on a road at a part where it merges from two lanes into one. I'm in the right lane because I know the left lane ends. I was behind a vehicle that was turning right, I wasn't in a hurry or anything so I just slow down as they slow down so that they can turn and after that I can be on my way (instead of going into the left lane to pass because there's still enough room to do that). During this time there is another vehicle behind me, also slowing down.

The vehicle in front hardly begins turning when a fourth vehicle behind all of us speeds past in the left lane, blaring their horn (Honker).

This really confused me because... Why? Why were they honking? 

1. Everyone has to slow down if there's a vehicle in front of you that has to turn.

2. Did they want me to pass on the left instead of slowing down? But then Honker would have had to slow down anyway because I'd be changing lanes and getting in front of them, right?

3. Or I wouldn't have had time to get into the left lane to pass because Honker was going so fast.

Why were they honking? Was there something I/we should have done differently?

Edit: formatting. Am I the asshole?",NTA. Sounds like the guy who honked thought he was in some kind of hurry and didn't actually look at what was going on before speeding past and honking. Some drivers will literally be 100% in the wrong and still honk at you so I wouldn't worry about it.,0,0,0,0,1

This month, we are moving the primary one. I am dealing with almost everything, including all the paperworks, registrations, moving company, etc. I am also doing an extensive research on lamps, bathroom furnitures, terrasse accesories etc. I show him my shortlists and because he is very easygoing, we mostly go with my preferences. However, everytime, he mentiones that he will install, build, hang, do whatever is needed for that product, himself. Saying things such as ‘Oh, i can do this with my silicon gun’. I told him that i want a professional to do those works. We had an argument and he said he wants to do those things because it is also his home. He added that this will make him happy. The problem is; he is not very good at it. When we bought the apartment 4 years ago in the other country we spend time regularly, he again wanted to do everything by himself. And i let him. The results were not satisfactory. 

He siliconed the shower , it did not work in first try. The second try was succesfull but i was not there at the moment and before siliconing it, he did not clean the edges, so after 4 years i can still see the dirt under the transparent silicon! 

We wanted to change the switches. Again he did the work himself and he ruined the paint under or above the switches. The wall’s base colour is seen on those areas. They look terrible. 

We wanted to hang a shelf in the kitchen. We did it together and we could not nail correctly and the shelf is still a bit ramped. 

We bought a shoe cabinet online and he built it. To this day, we have never been able to open the bottom drawer. 

For the bedroom, we wanted to have pendant light, he installed it. The upper part that needs to stick to the ceiling fell halfway, like a mourning country flag, and stayed liked this to this day. I have told him for 2,5 years very calmly to fix it. After some unsuccesful attemps, we had a fight about it 1,5 years ago. And now the pendant will forever be remebered as the one that i have shouted him over! 

The list goes on with similar stories. 

I also would like to mention that i am the money-saving and he is the money-spending team member. We both accept our roles and acknowledge the annoyence we create for the other one. So for him, this is not about saving money.

6328,8055,"AITA for being pissed at my friends?. So here's my story:

So like my friends I work and I study, and my friends which study with me are now pissed at me because the following events took place:

In December we had a paper to turn in, and since one of them was a father recently (Let's call him Joe) and the other one is going trough a hard time (Let's call him Pete), I started doing the paper about 2 weeks before the time ends. I'd do one page, or one paragraph and send it to them by e-mail for them to see what was being made. Anyway this keeps going until Joe tells me by e-mail that I was being an individualist by doing all that by myself, and I was somewhat hurt by that because my intentions were to help them since we have so little time (work and school). I said it was not my intention, I just wanted to get work done since I knew they had less time then I did. Anyway, I stopped working on the paper since I already did so much, and I waited for them to turn something over. But days passed and nothing was done, and they even had time to plan a dinner both of them and their wives. So the day before the deadline at about 8pm they send me their parts for me to put everything together and work on the rest of my part.
I did it, but I also sent an e-mail ranting about what happened, since we talked about making everything with time as it should be and not do everything in the last hour as it happened. I also said again that I started doing the paper soon to avoid this, and that the dinner that they both had could wait one more week because the paper had a deadline, the dinner didn't.
Joe got pretty pissed at me because of what I said, and so did Pete.


This time has passed and things are now awkward because Joe still insists that I had no right in saying what I did, and I am starting to feel pretty bad... But I think true friends should share the good and the bad and I think it's what I did. Maybe I am just a freakin asshole... :| thoughts?

She's had a crush on him for a while and when he got a girlfriend, she kept telling us that she'd be so much better than her etc. At first I told her that she would be a great girlfriend but he chose he and she should try and move on. 

Almost a year later, I find out that she's been exchanging nudes with Eli while he is still in a relationship. I told her that she needed to stop because he has a girlfriend, but she says that ""it's not my fault he cheated"". A couple months later, a video came out of Eli's girlfriend giving him head. Because of that, his girlfriend wouldn't do anything sexual with him for a bit. Eli ended up going to Rosa and she ended up giving him head in a bathroom. 

I've been telling Rosa that this behavior is not good and that she should stop. Even if he is the one cheating, she is the one encouraging it. Eli has been telling her ""If I wasn't dating my girlfriend, I'd totally be with you"". Which has been giving her hope in him, pushing her to keep doing stuff with him. I told her that if he actually wanted to be with her, he would ditch his girlfriend. I also told her that Eli was just a horny teenager who needs to get off.

48101,60374,"AITA for finding it unfair that my friend is asking me to pay for something that was already technically broken. About 8 weeks ago, I was living with my friend in her van for a little while after moving to a new city. She was going to an appointment so she drove us into the city, then rather than spend money on parking she asked me to drive the van back to the spot where we were staying. During that 20 minute drive I had the air con for a little while - it was a hot day. 

Fast forward a day or two later and we are driving somewhere and I suggest we put the air con on. She says we can't because it's broken, and it may start leaking. I say 'oh shit I wish I'd known yesterday as I had it on for part of the journey'. But no leaking so we both forget about it I assumed.

Now last night, I receive some texts from her about how its started leaking and I say that's annoying, then she says she's gonna have to send me the invoice to get it fixed. 

I tell her I think that's unfair for a few reasons, such as it being already broken and she hadn't given me prior warning. Additionally, I think part of owning a vehicle means accepting wear and tear and maintenance costs, and paying to fix it is a bonus in itselfs due to the added value of the car.

18749,23878,"AITA for kicking out a broke college student?. My boyfriend’s sister came to visit us for spring break. His sister is great and we get along pretty well, so I was excited. She would be staying at our house for 9 days. She asked us to bring her girlfriend we had never met. We were a little apprehensive at first, because we didn’t know the girlfriend, but his sister begged, so we agreed she could stay at our house.

The first day they arrived was nice, but things went south pretty quick. The girlfriend would leave messes all over the place, drop her dirty clothes on the floor, leave used tampons exposed on top of the trash, messed up our Netflix and amazon prime algorithms by watching things without our permission, and listen to music/tv on max volume, at odd hours of the night (when she knew we had work early in the morning.)

Additionally, she ate almost ALL of our snacks. I have no problem with sharing food, but she ate almost everything in the cupboards. She also would smoke and juul in our place after we asked her not to. She went in our bedroom and riffled through our things while we were not home. Some money went missing from our room but she denied it.

The real kicker was when she invited random friends to our house while we were not home. We came home (boyfriend’s sister was out visiting another friend, so she had no idea what her girlfriend was doing) and was greeted by about 10 people who were smoking weed, cigarettes, juuling, a huge mess of alcohol and pizza boxes. We asked them to leave and they gave us an attitude but eventually left. The girlfriend was pissed that we made her friends leave. We asked her not to this again.

But 2 days later she does it AGAIN. Invites even more people, who in turn leave a bigger mess and went through our personal things. I told them all to leave and one of them called me a “stuck up bitch” while the rest laughed. I had had enough and called my boyfriend (who was still at work) and boyfriend’s sister and told them what happened.

Boyfriend comes home and screams for them all to leave and pretends to call the cops. They leave quickly after that. I was so pissed that I told the girlfriend to pack her shit and leave, as she was no longer welcome in our home. She argued that she couldn’t afford a hotel and we were disrespecting a guest and were somehow homophobic ? She ended up staying at a hotel.

We got into one of the nicest dorms on campus that is hard to get into, because I entered and won a lottery (in which the prize is priority housing) by spending hours entering my name into the raffle, while none of the other three did. For reference, the number that they were assigned was in the thousands- without me winning the good lottery number, there is NO WAY they would have even had a chance of getting placed in this nice dorm.

While visiting our room for next year a few weeks ago, we noticed that one of the two rooms is larger than the other. While we haven’t talked formally yet, my roommate and I said that we should get the bigger room because without my effort to get the room we wouldn’t even be in it, and also, I am an athlete and have to report to school a month before everyone else and stay longer as well, even over holiday breaks. 

The suite mates said that they should get the larger room because my roommate has a boyfriend who will probably (their words, not mine) be over all the time and I will not want to be around him, so I will seek refuge in their room, so it makes sense that they should get it (I happen to be very good friends with roommates BF, so this most likely wouldn’t even be an issue). 

I don’t agree with this sentiment at all- that is a theoretical situation, whereas my reasoning is concrete. And honestly, I thought that is was typical that the person with the higher lottery number gets to choose their room.

As it is currently Christmas break, there are a few people who’ve come back recently to work from school including myself. Today I was scheduled to work (even though I marked off) so I was looking for someone to cover my shift. I asked a girl who we’ll call Rachel to cover my shift and she was happy to do so since she wasn’t getting scheduled at all over break.

I texted my boss to let him know Rachel was going to cover my shift and responded saying that she isn’t “really coverage at this point” and that since she hasn’t worked in so long and isn’t familiar with the new POS, she couldn’t work. I ended up going into work to talk to him about this in person and he explained to me that Rachel didn’t show any desire to work over break and apparently told an old manager that she didn’t want to work this school year. My boss told me that because she went away to school and didn’t express a desire to work over breaks, he took this as her quitting and removed her from payroll and scheduling. I told him that was the dumbest thing I ever heard because Rachel sent emails to the old manager with her availability for Christmas 4 times as well as coming into the shop in person and speaking to the boss himself about getting hours. I told my boss that regardless of any of that, the fact that there was zero communication on his part was completely unacceptable and that Rachel needed to be told something about her current employment status.

Long story shorts the breakup was unexpected for her and she was devastated by it. She is still hurt to this day. Today we were in a meeting where he was also at. I saw them talking a couple of times. She told me she was still hurt from the breakup but that she was excited because they were going to meet later to drink some beers. I immediately blurted out ""doesn't he have a girlfriend though?"". Her face immediately changed.

Turns out she doesn't follow him on social media anymore, I thought they did. Around November I saw him posting photos of a trip he and another girl were making, and posted a photo on Instagram hugging her. I immediately assumed it was a new relationship, but didn't think much of it. I honestly thought my friend had seen it. But apparently she hasn't. She started crying immediately. I was honestly at a loss and felt so bad, that's why I think I was a major asshole.

I left to get something to eat and talked to another friend, I told her I screwed up and she asked me why did I think showing her was a good idea. I don't know why I did it.

I came back they were talking together (friend and ex), then he came directly to me and asked me if I had shown her the picture. I don't know if she told him it was me directly or if he assumed, nevertheless I was shocked and didn't say anything, but he also asked me why did I do that and to go get her as she was crying and didn't want to be in the meeting. I told him I was sorry, sincerely and he just replied with a hand wave.

My friend said she was thankful I showed her as it would come up sooner or later, but with her reaction and both him and my other friend basically telling me I screwed up makes me doubt. I have a history of making faux passes when it comes to social interactions and I only find out when I had already done them.

So people, did I act like an asshole? Thanks.. Am I the asshole?","NAH. You didn’t just say “hey look at his new girlfriend”, you brought up the fact that he’s in a new relationship before she went out with him as she likely would’ve been taken by surprise if it came up, and this lets her be prepared before she sees him.

So I started a new job about 4 months ago, and my first day one of my coworkers realized we live really close to each other and he told me to save my money (I don’t have a car) and she would pick me up and take me home. He won’t accept gas money or any sort of reimbursement for it, which is really nice and I let him know how much I appreciate it. The issue is that he’s absolutely terrible at being on time in the mornings- I usually send a text about a half hour before our start time letting him know I’m ready to go and to let me know when he’s on the way. He usually doesn’t reply until 15 minutes before or sometimes less than 10 minutes before we’re supposed to clock in letting me know he’s on the way. I live roughly a mile from work, so I’m usually there within two minutes of our start time on these days, but I’m responsible for making coffee and turning on the phones, which has to be done right at the start time. The last few days, we’ve gotten here two minutes before we’re supposed to open, and I have to run to make coffee before the phones get turned on, resulting in the phones being on a few minutes late.

41513,52110,"WIBTA for not giving someone a ride?. I really might be in the wrong here so please be honest.

&#x200B;

Next week I'm going to a conference about a 4 hour drive away. It's my third year going and I always drive myself. This conference is a super social event - there are panels and stuff, but it's mostly about industry networking, drinking and hanging out. I enjoy that stuff but I'm definitely the type of person who gets drained by too much socializing (especially this kind, where you have to strike that perfect balance between fun and professional). So I really relish that long solo drive on the way up and back - coming in, it helps me relax and get into a good headspace, and driving home it helps me unwind. 

&#x200B;

There is a guy who lives in my area, ""Jeff,"" who is also in this industry and attends these conferences. I like Jeff, he's a really friendly guy and it's nice to have someone from back home to hang out with when all the schmoozing starts to get exhausting. Jeff is also kind of my boss - not at my full time job, but he runs a small events company for which I do occasional work on weekends. So he's like my side hustle boss.

&#x200B;

Last year, Jeff sort of invited himself to ride home with me from the conference (he had taken a train in) and I rolled with it. He was... not a great passenger. He took calls on speakerphone and talked to them at top volume for a solid hour; when he was done with his calls and I asked if he minded if I listened to a podcast, he said it was fine but then proceeded to talk over it the whole time; and he left garbage in my car. He also didn't offer any gas money.

&#x200B;

So a couple weeks ago Jeff stopped by my office to say hi and the topic of the conference came up. He suggested that maybe he'll ride with me since I'm driving anyway (otherwise he takes the train). I left it at ""yeah maybe, let's see how our timing works out."" Ever since, I've been torn on what to do. I obviously don't want to give him a ride - I want my peaceful 4 hour drive of listening to music and podcasts in blissful solitude. Buuut that seems like a dick move, and my boyfriend agrees - when I suggested that I just be honest and tell Jeff that I need that alone time, my bf said that sounds ruder than just saying no without an explanation. 

  
I feel like it's rude to say no at all, but the thought of Jeff riding with me again is giving me anxiety. So WIBTA for telling him I can't give him a ride?

In the past 2 or so years, my brother, who is a single gay guy, started going out to clubs every weekend and picking up strangers. They usually go to the other guy's place, they rarely come here, but sometimes they do. I noticed he was sleeping over at other people's places when he started showing up home all knackered on Sunday mornings.

I recently asked him about it and he said why not have fun while you're young. I said I'm almost the same age as him and I couldn't even imagine living like that. He said that if I want him to stop bringing people over, that he would, but I said that's not the issue. It happens rarely and besides, my girlfriend also comes over a lot, so that doesn't have to change. But I said that generally, I don't understand how he can do this without feeling empty.

30152,38101,"AITA for accusing my colleague of sexual harassment?. I (female) had a job where I got in trouble for complaining about what I personally perceive to be sexual harassment (calling my mobile to tell me she was staring at my ass, touching me inappropriately, even sneaking up so I can't dodge her hands, making lewd comments, and much more). I was afraid of losing my job, so I suffered in silence until I snapped at her in the team's Whatsapp chat and responded to a lame joke she made with ""Well, at least neither the punchline nor your hands are below anyone's belt for once"", and my supervisor yelled at me for that, and also for calling her neediness ""sexual harassment"" because ""she just likes to touch people"", and he was also angry that I didn't consider her feelings as my accusations might make her cry. While some colleagues told me I was right and also felt bothered by her behaviour, none testified before HR, so I lost my job because I looked like a bully who caused gratuitous drama. I never thought I acted in an inviting manner but was blamed for dressing ""provocatively"" (there was no dress code), for being friendly with her (should I, a then-newbie, yell at a senior colleague?), and for not considering how lonely she was outside of work (boohoo?). After my last day, I told the entire office, and apparently that made me a bully, too, and the whole team shuns me while they stay in touch with other ex colleagues.

Add to clarify, I was told that my Whatsapp snap was inappropriate and way worse than her behaviour, and that I should view her behaviour as humorous or at least not sexual? Was I being small-minded there? Personally I think not, but I tend to overreact.

I go into the kitchen, and theres just...so much crap everywhere, no counterspace, W's candle making stuff all over the stove, dishes to the left, in and right of the sink.

Went through every room in the house for glasses, dishes, whatever thank god there wasnt much I also though, fuck it, im gonna get a new pan.

21196,26929,"AITA for wanting to take my son instead of my fiancé on a week long vacation?. A little background:

My son is 4 months old now and perfect. I'm honestly not trying to brag when I say he is the best baby; he has slept through the night since 1 month old, doesn't cry unless he's hungry or uncomfortable, and is just the happiest bubbliest baby I've ever met in my life. 

My fiancé and I were invited on a family vacation to FL in the beginning of August. We jumped on the idea because who wouldn't want to take a week off and hang out at the beach? I was also excited for our baby to experience the ocean, since I hadn't until I was 16 years old. 

I expressed this joy to my fiancé and he shut it down immediately. He told me that our son wouldn't remember the trip, and that we should just enjoy a week off as individuals instead of parents. I agree with his points but I still want to bring my baby because he will be 8 months old by then and will have a blast, and obviously we would take pictures to show him when he was older and would understand. My grandmother is also coming, who told me that we'd only have ""visitation rights"" (lol) when we brought him, meaning we would have plenty of time to be ourselves and enjoy each other in a different state.

My fiancé is still not on board. He has come up with the new excuse that we should fly down (impractical bc of the location of the nearest airport, prices, etc.) and leave our son with his mother because he already told her to request off of work. He also doesn't want to drive 16 hours (it's only 11, and we'd break it up in two days) with an 8 month old who'd scream the whole time. I'm wondering if we have the same baby because he does not do that. We just recently took a two hour trip together, just the baby and me, and he slept the whole time there and the whole time back.

So I told my fiancé if he didn't want to go he didn't have to, but I'm still bringing the baby. This obviously upset him because he, too, has taken time off of work already and he wants to go on vacation. I think he's being completely unreasonable, even if our son won't remember the trip. I will remember and it's great bonding time and getting him out of our bumfuck state for a week (not that FL is any better) (sorry FL).

Our relationship started off really well and it seemed like we were inseparable as we tried to spend as much time as possible together. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. After hanging out all day, we come up on the topic of being gay and childhood. Then she admitted to me that she’s never actually had a crush on anyone and how she considered being in a “queer platonic” relationship.

This made me really upset/shocked (she told me before she liked girls + guys and she’s the one who asked me to be her girlfriend) and I basically told her I didn’t believe in such a relationship and asked if she was really attracted to me, to which she very quickly answered yes and then the conversation ended.

After this it seemed like she was avoiding me. We both work a full time internship but I kept trying to make time for us and she kept pushing me away (even though she had PLENTY of time to spend with her guy friend who she spent almost everyday with).

I confronted her about it and she pretty much told me that she was aromantic and knew about she might be before we started dating but tried to push herself to be in a relationship. We decided to end it mutually but she said she would love to still be friends because our breakup doesn’t really change anything for her. 

I’m at the point where I’m pissed at her and I don’t want to see her again because 1) I feel like our whole relationship was a lie. 2) This was the first relationship I have ever been in and I feel like I’ve been cheated out of it. 3) It upsets me that I’m the only hurt by our breakup. 4) We met on a dating app so intention of DATING was pretty clear.

I think everyone could manage without me for a week. If I needed to get home in a pinch, there's an airport an hour from my destination and I have some money saved that I could use for the travel, but I would not consider leaving in the first place if I didn't think my grandpa wouldn't survive through that time.  So, would I be the asshole for going with my boyfriend to meet his family while my family is going through this tough time?. Am I the asshole?",NAH but I would talk to the other members of your family about it to make sure they can make due without your presence. You can make it up to them by giving them more of a break when you get back from your trip. Sometimes we all need a break especially when we are dealing with a sick family member. As long as someone is there to care/help them in your absence I don't see anything wrong here. Enjoy your trip if you decide to go,0,0,0,1,0
42293,53091,"AITA if I won't pay for my son to go to college because he got a girl pregnant?. I have a 17 year old who is applying to college this year. His mom and I have always said we'd help him but he would still need to take loans to cover the whole thing. He's a good student, hasn't gotten into trouble at school, generally respectful of us. I knew he had a girlfriend (Susan) and we've sat down a few times, talked about safe sex, about never sending/receiving naked pictures, about not getting drunk and having sex, etc.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I get a hysterical screaming phone call from Susan's mother.  Susan is four months pregnant and that my son is the father. Susan is going to keep the baby and Susan's mother says she's going to go after my son for child support.  I sit my son down and he confirms it. He's probably the father. When he heard, he said he'd pay for her abortion but she said she didn't want to have one.

&#x200B;

I'm pissed.  If he is the father - and I don't believe it until we get a paternity test - I am not going to let him go off to college. He needs to get a job and work. My son is distraught and says he can get a better paying job after college. He said he'll cover more of his tuition with loans and use whatever money we saved to pay child support. I said no, that's his money for college, not his ""I fucked up"" money. His mother says there's no way he can support a child on a teenager's salary. I said he should have thought about that before he screwed a teenage girl. I also told my wife if she decided to give him the money anyway, since it's a shared account, I will make her pay me my half back. If she wants to have a second child, she can do it without me.

29986,37898,"AITA for cancelling weekend vacation plans with my girlfriend?. For the past two weeks my girlfriend has said she wanted to visit a specific national park and spend the weekend there.  I told her I could arrange it and it should be fun.  I found out the drive would be 11 hours each way (a few hours longer than I expected), and the lodging would be very expensive.  She could help with the costs but not until she got paid after the trip was over.  During this period my finances took a hit but I was thinking I could still make it work.

About two days before we would leave she started questioning if she wants to go and some of her wants to stay home.  I tell her we should go and it will be fun.  She continued on with her doubts, then that night she starts complaining about using her car for the trip and doesn't want to put the miles on it, and we should use a rental car instead (my car isn't fit for this length of a trip and she knows this, she has a new car).  Plus we were supposed to leave in 24 hours.  I tell her I'll look into it, but mostly thinking she is making excuses not to go.

I checked rental cars and realize it is going to cost more money than I had, and the trip might not be worth it since we'd be driving so much of the time.  This combined with a feeling she would rather stay home, I text her while she was at work the next day that things aren't working out for this trip but we can still have a fun weekend if we stay home.  She says OK and that she just wants to have a good time.  I feel fine with this and cancel the lodging reservation I made.  I come up with some ideas of things we can do locally and have fun outdoors.

After the hangout, she messages me and tells me that I made it uncomfortable by calling her ""dude"", and that it's an overly masculine term to call her, and that I wouldn't be comfortable if someone said to me ""Hey girl"" (i'm a guy).

I messaged back ""Noted. Apologies if I made you uncomfortable - didn't mean to. I just view 'dude' as fairly gender neutral, but I understand if you'd prefer I didn't use it to you.""

Our living situation is a bit weird. His parents live in quite a large house, which has a lot of spare land. They build a small, holiday home connected to their house that they used to Airbnb. It turns out their location is really popular, so they expanded to building a few small summer homes in the fields on the property, and they offered the summer house connected to their house to me and my boyfriend for a very cheap price. I am a student, bf works full time. 

The issue arises in that we have no privacy. In-laws have two other children aged 2 and 4, both of whom have severe behavioural issues (that are used as an excuse not to discipline). In-laws decide they can just come in to our home whenever (usually without knocking) and have also allowed the children to do the same. Of course, our house has forcibly been childproofed by them, instead of just watching their kids and teaching them they can't just run in. 

MIL will also come into our home when we're gone and do chores. I know this sounds like a blessing, but it's really not. She will come in, wash dishes or do laundry, then expect favours back. Every time one of the children has a tantrum (5+ times a day each) if my bf is at home they will force him to come to their house and babysit, or will allow the children to come to our house and cry.

Bf has asked them to stay out of the house when we aren't there, and has told them to knock.

Ok no problem. So while we’re eating dinner she decides to say to her mom than she needs the money back for the stuff she got for the dinner. I interrupted before my wife could reply with “really?” “we’re 6000 euros into the trip and you’re going to ask for 10 euros for something that only you and your boyfriend eat?” And with that came the trickle of tears. My wife tried to redirect to conversation and we moved on but she was butt hurt the next couple hours. Needless to say I felt like an ass but really I’m to the point of we both suck.

49879,62581,"AITA for calling my friend at work. Like the title says, but with some context.

My friend M is an avid phone user. She is always snap chatting our group or individually, posting on her insta or snap story, texting, etc. She also just started seeing a new guy within the past week and I know she was with him last night. 

Now, a mutual friend and I both noticed separately that M hadn't contacted either of us today (this was around 6pm, we usually have about 5 snap story times by now). I had asked the other members of our group chat, M also didn't talk to any of them today. Her location is off (unusual for her) and she wasn't picking up calls, but the phone was ringing. 

She usually works Thursdays, so everything mentioned considered, I called her work. It may have been a jump, but I saw no harm in making sure she got to work ok. I call and an employee answers. I ask if M is there, prefacing I'm her friend and we were concerned with her whereabouts. He puts me on hold, then M gets on the phone a minute or so later. I say, ""M, omg, girl we were worried about you-"" she cuts me off to say, ""Ok, sorry I don't have my phone on me, I am at work and I'm very busy but this is honestly ridiculous"" and hangs up on me. 

I was so floored. I could see being confused or annoyed, but she seemed very angry. Maybe it was a stressful work day, she does work at a popular bar.

I was excited to only have my two youngest with me and getting a little bit of a ""break"". As the server is delivering the food (and all the chaos that comes with that) my 3 year old decided to stand up and touch one of the recessed lights burning his hand. I tried everything to calm him down ice water, even went out to the car and got some burn cream from my first aid kit, which was brand new and had to bring it in to use the restaurant's scissors to cut the package open.

Not once did any of the staff ask he was ok or what happened. When i explained to the front desk lady what happened she just gave a sympathetic nod and then scurried away. He was crying so hard I had to ask for to go boxes and the bill. They didn't even offer to help me box it up. Thankfully one if my friends was able to coax the wailing, drooling, snotty kiddo out of my arms so I could box everything up.

Now I'm not looking for a free meal, I should have been paying more attention to him and realized he was standing in his seat, but the lack of concern frustrated me.

That the staff didn’t bend over backwards to help comfort your kid, who was so well supervised by you that he was standing on the furniture and touching recessed lighting?? Was the lighting ever meant to be touched?? No. Was it obvious that your lack of supervision caused the incident? Yup. Did the staff do ANYTHING to injure your child?? Nope. 

The staff likely had to apologize to other customers, as YOUR kid wailing after being injured very obviously disrupted the meals of other diners, which could very easily lead to lower tips for the servers. Should they apologize for being hands-off and trying to mitigate the damage with the other customers? Hell no. They weren’t rude.

I've had my reservations about the whole thing from the start seeing as they had only been dating for a month when he proposed. And there seem to be a lot of red flags with the guy. I tried to be supportive and help her plan it last summer (because weddings take a lot of fucking planning) but one thing or another got in the way. She's super scattered and flakey anyway so we just never made any solid plans. They didn't set a date until mid January. I happened to start a new job in January so I have 0 free time for anything now, especially when she lives an hour away and was my baby sitter (but stopped babysitting to plan her wedding) so now I also don't have a babysitter.

So now we're a couple days out from the wedding, there is no real plan, she barely answers my texts to try and figure out what's going on. There isn't even a rehearsal. And she keeps making plans without saying anything to me and then getting irritated when I can't participate because I wasn't given notice.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

I work in an accounting firm. I wrote the usual email for this time of year asking my clients to send in their information. As is typical, it was the same email to everyone just with different names. My manager said it was fine to send (though he didn't really read through it line-by-line as it was generic). It is pretty obvious (in my opinion) to anyone reading it that the email is generic. 

&#x200B;

It was sent to exactly 39 clients, all of which I have known for at least one year (most much longer), spoken to many times but always professionally. The email finished with:

   
 

""Merry Christmas/happy holidays (whichever applies!)

Best wishes,

OP""

   
 

3 of those clients have made negative comments in their replies (and I only sent the email on Friday):

1) ""I am very surprised you mention Christmas as I am Jewish. I think you could have figured that out very easily from my name."" (it wasn't obvious to me at all, though maybe I am just ignorant)

2) ""Very unprofessional to mention religious holidays""

3) ""I do not celebrate Christmas""

If it matters at all, comment #2 was from a Christian, comment #3 from a Muslim (which I know from previous conversations).

In hindsight I should have just not mentioned Christmas at all, but I didn't think much of it as I am from a moderately-religious Sikh family that has always celebrated Christmas. I didn't anticipate anyone getting touchy about it, though again maybe I am just being ignorant.

55688,69971,"AITA for thinking my friend was selfish in buying me a present?. I'm really into photography. I have a small side business where I do it myself and I have a number of local photographers who I avidly recommend and follow on social media. One photographer in particular is my favorite and I always said if I were to get married I would want to hire him. 

For my 30th birthday, my friend Kim bought me a 1-hour session with my favorite photographer, amazing right? I was really excited until I discovered there was a bit of a catch. 

First of all, she had decided the 1-hour session was to be spent with us doing ""friend photos"" meaning a photo shoot for her and I. Second, she already booked a date in the summertime even though I wanted to have it in the fall. Her reasoning was that her and her husband were trying for a baby soon and she didn't want to ""look pregnant"" in the photos. Third, she wanted to make sure we coordinate outfits (which I was ok with) and to have it at the local winery.  

I vented to my boyfriend and mom saying how I feel like it's not really a present for me because she's calling all the shots. I know the photographer is expensive and I felt guilty that she spent so much money so I am going along with it, but ultimately it feels like it's a gift for her, not a gift for me. My mom feels like I should just suck it up and Kim doesn't mean anything malicious and she's obviously doing it because she thinks it's what I would want. 

It's also worth nothing that Kim has recently started posting a lot on instagram and saying how her dream job would be as an IG ""influencer"" which makes me feel like the photoshoot is yet again, for her. 

I personally feel like if it was a gift for me, I should be able to decide what kind of photos I'm getting. 

AITA for not being excited about this gift?. Am I the asshole?","ESH. Your friend shouldn’t have booked the time of the shoot without your consent, regardless of her plans to get pregnant. That’s grade-A selfishness right there. I can also see her decision on the location as presumptuous, but I’m not as offended on your behalf about that.

For your share, a little anecdote first: my birthday is this weekend, and my best friend booked us an Airbnb in a different state. She’s paid for all the lodging, we’ll be taking her car, and she’ll pay for my birthday meal and drinks. That’s huge, yeah? But she also put some events on the itinerary that’ll be more meaningful for her than for me. And you know what? I’m so game for it. Why? Because she’s been so giving and considerate in every other way that, even though it’s my birthday, I owe it to her to let her revel in her own sacrifices too. I mean, she’s my best friend. We’re only going to grow even closer because of this trip, and it’s all thanks to her.

So no, I don’t think it’s asshole behavior at all to fork down a shit ton of money for your favorite photographer and want to make it a friends shoot. Your friend deserves a share in it too. You have every right to request an autumn shoot and a change of location, but the buck stops with your otherwise ungrateful attitude, and this is where you’re also TA. I’m seeing too much “What about me?” and not enough “Neat for me AND neat for us.” You’re not spending a dime, and even though it’s your birthday, some consideration for your friend is still due.

My house isn’t very clean, because I’m the one taking care of a five person household while my mother is bed ridden and my father works 80hr weeks. I almost told them to be more respectful then, but I had to go take care of my mom.

Then, maybe half an hour later, I hear laughing and yelling from my room, and my sister yells “A rat is dead!” I go upstairs and see my sister and her friends all laughing while poking my dead pet rat. After I took the rat out to check on it (Yes, very dead.

I am now married and live about 200 miles away, I currently commute between my marital home and work during the week, and that is a 200 mile one way commute. For these reasons I do not visit my home town very often. The last time I saw my parents was 6 months ago. Both my parents still live in my home town and are divorced.

My Dad is suggesting that we go on an Easter Egg hunt with my Daughter (his grand-daughter) this weekend when I go home, **I do not have an issue with my father seeing his grand-daughter**, what I do have an Issue with is his limitations due to health. My Dad is Obese (280lbs/125Kgs) and has COPD, when we have been out previously with my daughter he has struggled to breathe and keep up with her and had to take regular breaks. My daughter is now 3, more active and loves to run around.

He is suggesting that we go on an Easter Egg hunt around a local park, this park has quite steep hills and I know his mobility will be an issue, which is counter intuitive to a ""Egg Hunt"". I feel as if that this is not an efficient or effective way to spend our time together and want to suggest something different.

He has previously offered to babysit my daughter, I flat out refused this offer very bluntly explaining that I have concerns about his health and the ability for him to keep up with an active toddler. He has since expressed his displeasure to me that he wasn't happy that I was so blunt. 

He is also wanting to visit me for his upcoming birthday in July and told me ""to make it easier for you"", however he has since told my sister that he has asked to visit us is so ""that I don't spend time with my mother"" and he's upset that we stay at my mum's house when I go home, Ignoring the fact that he lives in a one bedroom council bungalow and my mother lives in a three bedroom house by herself and when I do go home, I ensure I see both parents and try to visit certain friends. 

These comments lead me to believe that he will not be happy with the fact I will suggest something else, and when asked why it will be for I believe to be a genuine reason he will react negatively towards it and think it is for other reasons.

I wasn't thrilled in the slightest, but whatever, a good pair of headphones were enough to block him out.

54591,68559,"WIBTA if I started a new job while knowing that I would be quitting in 6 months?. Gonna keep the details vague for privacy reasons.

Some backstory: I had a job as an entry-level accountant that I left when I had first got pregnant. Sadly, I had a miscarriage in the late 3rd trimester due to complications. When I was well enough to work again, I decided to work at a local mill in a labour role to take my mind off what happened. 

Present: After 6 months at the mill, I want to get back into the office. I've been diagnosed with tendonitis in both my wrists, my back hurts most days, and I'm just done with physical labour. I'm also pregnant again, just shy of 2 months. I've yet to tell the mill folk, because I'm not quite in the ""safe"" zone, and I'm concerned they may let me go because I won't be able to do as much physical labour in a few months, and it will be difficult to accommodate me as there a few non-labour tasks that I could do. 

Also, now that I'm pregnant again, I've become more and more paranoid that the physical labour that I do may cause another miscarriage. I'm on my feet for 8 hours, there's a lot of twisting, and heavy lifting (40 lbs +).  I started looking for work elsewhere and managed to get a job offer at an accounting firm that pays better, is (obviously) way less labour intensive, and has stable daytime hours (current job does 3 weeks day shift and then switch to 3 weeks nights) . The new position is full time and permanent. 

That all being said, if I took this new job, I'd only stay until I until my 8th preggo month (in 6 months). I also wouldn't tell them I was pregnant until after my probationary period of 3 months (I recognize that this already seems a bit skeevy). I also don't intend to go back to work after as the plan has always been that I would be a stay at home mom.

13509,17291,"AITA for not letting my little brother use my tennis racket for a school competition?. So basically, here in Melbourne Australia, today is Monday and also a public holiday for the state. My brother was told on Friday (4 days ago) that he was automatically entered into a tennis competition within his school because he enrolled last year (not sure about the truthfull-ness of this info as a school can’t enroll someone like that without asking) except that my brother (13yo) left his racket at his grandparents house who lives interstate.

Instead, he wants to use my racket which cost me $330 out of my own pocket that I saved. All things I buy, I take good care of and I don’t want damaged, so when I loan out items I make sure they aren’t given out lightly.

However whenever I play with my brother in tennis and I win against him, he always goes through tantrums and mimicks players on tv by hitting balls out of the court and smashing his racket on the ground.

Its mainly for this reason I don’t want to loan him the racket, even though he claims he wont do anything like that at school. AITA?

Edit: the reason why I said its a public holiday here is because the competition is tomorrow (tuesday) and can’t tell his school today that he has to cancel (if he wants to).

Also by the way, we do have a 3rd racket that he can use but because he’s smashed it and everything, he doesn’t want to use it. Also because “its not good enough”. Although, how good of a racket does a 13-year-old really need?. Am I the asshole?","No you're not.

So this Christmas the plan is for my fiancé and I to fly out and visit my parents. We’ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there’s no privacy at my parents’ (Which is true - we won’t be the only guests there. But it’s literally two nights!). 

Aside from that I’m already going to have to deal with my mother’s hurt feelings over this since I don’t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fiancé feels somewhat smothered. But again, it’s two freaking nights. 

Anyway I told her that I’m not spending money on a hotel room and that I’m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she’s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she’s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn’t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they’re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I’m trying to save so we can finally buy a house).

Ok Reddit so here's a situation I've been chewing for a while, although happened a year ago I still think about whether I was the asshole in this situation or not. So back when I was just finishing up college, I was part of a nudes group on fb that a irl friend had invited me to. I was having some body image issues at the time so I actually really enjoyed posting and getting feedback and helping others with their images. 
  
  One day my Irl friend posted about a crappy situation that happened to her on a dating site, where after she rejected a guy asking her out he called her a fat whore and blocked her, she posted on the nudes group asking for some support. After a little while the comments were overwhelmingly what I considered a little hurtful with other women commenting that men are ""vile and trash"" and straight men are garbage and worthless and evil etc. Etc. 
   
 I found the thread kind of hurtful and commented that although I was horrified that someone had done that to her on the website I didn't think it was fair for the comment section to condemn an entire gender calling them vile worthless garbage. I immediately got slammed saying I was hijacking the thread and taking away from victims who were well within their rights to attack their suppressors and I was acting like part of the #notallmen movement. 

    They banned me after I made a couple more comments defending my comment and it still bothers me to this day. I don't think I was the asshole but I still think about it. I'm open to a new opinion about it. 

So Reddit was I the asshole? . Am I the asshole?","ESH, and hear me out.

As a woman who would be considered progressive, I think generalizations in any direction are ridiculous. Even if they're meant to be hyperbolic, or even jokes, I think they're unproductive, and don't do anything for the modern feminist movement. What does shitting on all men accomplish? 

But, I also see where they're coming from when they accuse you of ""hijacking"" the thread. It's not a political debate, and it's just not the time or the place to debate semantics.

I've tried to mention several times that I would help straighten up the house, especially since windows are getting installed soon and the guys will need clear working room.

32686,41286,"AITA for turning off my sister's TV?. My sister is 14, I'm 16. Last week she came into my room while I was playing Xbox during a really crucial moment. I like her company well enough so I told her she could stay as long as she didnt touch the tv or talk too much, cause I was trying to hear my headset.

We got to a really serious part and out of nowhere my sister reached over and turned my TV off!

I started cussing and yelling at her and she started laughing, said I told her not to touch the xbox but I didnt say anything about the TV. I picked her up and carried her back to her room. When I got back my team had already lost. I was pissed.

A couple days later my parents surprised us both with these really cool Smart TVs. We got good grades last year and this was our reward. I also learned something really cool: my phone's bluetooth can connect to the TVs and turn them on and off. 

And it also does that to my sister's TV.

I could hear her in her room playing a game of her own, getting really into it, things sounded dicey. And then I turned her TV off. I heard her throw her controller and start cursing. I laughed and a little while later I heard her playing again.

We've had the TVs for about five days and I've done it about three or four times a day in that time. She thinks her TV is broken so my parents took it back to the store to get her a replacement.

When they got home and my sister hooked her new TV up and got into a game I did it one more time. Then I sent her that old meme of the smug grinning face. I finally admitted to what I was doing and my sister got really upset. Apparently because I kept turning her TV off she was losing in her games and apparently a bunch of her teams and guilds had kicked her out. She was really upset and I told her to imagine how I felt when she did it to me.

45064,56589,"AITA For getting involved in my friends relationship and telling her stuff about her boyfriend. Ok so some context:

So the people involved in this are for, me, my friend, her bf, and my other friend, we’re all 20 and friends with each other, also, during this time, my friend and BF weren’t together anymore, but they still saw each other and went back and forth because they weren’t prepared yet to return or whatever 

What happened is, OF and i we were flirting around and calling each other at night and stuff after we went on a date, we were interested in each other it seemed

OF had an event at her school, a big expo, and she invited me and BF, the three of us were supposed to go drinking after the expo was over 

BF hadn’t arrived yet, and at one moment OF went to the bathroom and left her phone with me, I noticed that she received a lot of messages from BF, I had a moment of insecurity and checked her messages with her and noticed that they were flirting too and they explicitly said that they wanted to do things behind my back

I got depressed and frustrated and left, I don’t know if BF went to the expo or whatever I just left, anyways I was wondering if I should tell my friend about her (at that moment ex) BF flirting with OF, because I knew that BF would try to be again with her, and I thought that she deserved to know 

That was around month and a half ago, I was waiting for a good opportunity to tell her and that was yesterday, we went out together because she owed me some money, we talked for a bit and turns out that they returned back together like 2 days after the expo happened, and she didn’t know about the situation, I told her about what happened, not out of spite or malice, I just thought that she should know, and obviously she got sad, some hours later she told me that she confronted BF and he told her that I was lying, I affirmed that I just told her what I saw and went trough, and then she confronted OF, she hasn’t talked with me since so I don’t know what happened

Regardless of what happens I just think that, if I were on her shoes I would like to be informed about it if one of my friends knew, so I just told her because I care about her, but now I’m starting to think that maybe that was not my problem and that I wasn’t the one that should have told her, I don’t know, I don’t like drama honestly and I feel bad now that I got involved in their relationship and that perhaps she may think I’m lying to her, I already lost BF and OF as friends and losing her too would be a huge blow, do you think I messed up?.

Little bit of backstory here

A group a friends of mine all decided to play minecraft again at around the same time, we booted up the relic and decided to create a survival world with anything and everything. We binged Avatar: The Last Airbender then decided we wanted to make a replica 4 nations from the show to minecraft world to the best of our ability through survival - hard mode.

FF 3 months and we finished the Eastern and Western Air Temple, the Northern and Southern Water-Tribe locations made a giant ass Lion Turtle that swims around thanks to some fancy redstone and pistons that push it, and were working on the giant Banyan grove tree (the giant ass tree swamp).

We found a fortress and decided to kill the ender dragon to get to the end city where they have the elctras to go fly around. We kill the dragon and all got off except for the host, the next day the host told us he turned on cheats and was flying around because it took a while to search through the end city and wasn't all that fun without everybody else on to faf about with. Now, this is where everything drops, he didn't realize that doing so would fuck everybody else in regards to the world was now listed as a creative world. The only evidence that we did what we did in survival was word of mouth, I stated that the ""fun"" of the world has been lost due to the fact that I didn't know if flying was all he did and there was a new surplus of materials.

Some may argue that the fun came of playing together with what we did, but i'm just the kind of guy that found the fun in working for it with the endless hours of grinding to finally have the final product before you, the satisfaction that I held for anything we did after the fact was lackluster and absent. The others in the group were not as annoyed as I was with the host viewing it as both an honest mistake and the fun is in doing everything together.

While it has made me cringe a little (for context, I was in an interracial relationship for seven years, and saw my fair share of racism), it's been in the context of a conversation where I was asking questions about who the person was.

  
Today, we were playing a game with his nephew, when the little boy said ""I always like black"" referring to playing checkers. My husband responded with ""So does my cousin, (female cousin's name)."" My sister-in-law laughed, and I left the room, not appreciating the joke.

54542,68499,"AITA for not paying my mom back $150?. Earlier this year my mom and I planned a short weekend trip together. We found a hotel for $300 and my mom asked if I could pay for it using my credit card. I said yes and she sent me $150 over PayPal for her portion of the hotel. A few days later, before I booked it, we decided to wait on taking the trip until the summer and decided to extend it by a couple of days. We found a new hotel and the price was $600, it was non-refundable which my mom and I were both okay with (we booked using a third party site). I booked it using my credit card and immediately used the $150 she already sent to make a credit card payment on the card used to book.

Fast forward a few weeks and I go into the hospital for the next three months, I use up all of my PTO so I can no longer go on the trip. My mom also decides she doesn't want to go on the trip and uses her remaining PTO on a trip with my dad. After getting out of the hospital, I wound up needing to file for bankruptcy due to the medical debt, which means the remaining amount left on my credit card from the hotel (around $350 at this point, as I was making monthly payments to the card) will be discharged in the bankruptcy.

I was talking with my mom about filing bankruptcy, and how we are no longer going on the trip, and she asked for her $150 back. I told her that I do not have the $150 as it was used straight away to make a payment to my credit card for the hotel. She thinks that since I no longer owe the remaining $350 for the hotel, that I should have to pay her back the $150. I do not feel I should have to pay her back as we both consented to the booking of a non-refundable hotel. It isn't like I have the $150 lying around, it is gone. If I paid her back, she would not be getting the original $150 she sent me back, she would be getting $150 of my money.

For context: my parents had a very very messy separation and divorce over 4 years. My father had an affair with his current girlfriend, D. My mother has since moved on to her current live in boyfriend, G.

My mum kinda had (im aware this is most likely not the correct term, please forgive me) a psychotic break for 3 years, during one episode, she threatened to abandon us (my sister was 18, I was 14), and another episode we could have charged her with a domestic abuse charge. 


Now, I (18f) live out of home with my sister, L (22), because i felt like i was suffocating at home (and the reason listed above) with my mum and G. My dad moved down to Melbourne around July 2019, so (before Christmas when he came up for the day) I hadn't seen him since then. 


My dad gave me an opportunity to come down to Melbourne and stay with him for a few weeks. Ive never been to Melbourne so I agreed. My mum however, didn't like this. At. All. 


She was very passive aggressive before saying outright she didnt like it and that she didn't trust it. I kinda just changed the subject cause I don't want to fight with my mother. 


Eventually, my dad and I expanded the trip to about a month (the 9th to the 30th) and my mum basically denounced the idea.

Now, you might be thinking “why did you take him box? Surely it had his name on it?” 

To that I say, no- there was no name on it and to add insult to injury- there were people leaving their boxes that they did not finish for other people to take if they liked leading to a Pavlovian response to hunt down any box that was not already claimed.

26683,33732,"AITA for not wanting to listen to my friend's delusions anymore?. Me (f 23) and my friend (m 23) recently moved to a new city together to get out of our hometown, and currently do not have any other friends around besides each other. We have been friends for around 6 years now. He has really bad hypochondria and is constantly convinced that he is dying.

He's had these delusions for most of the time I've known him, but they have recently started getting really bad the past year or so. Multiple times a day he will send me articles from WebMD (of course) of some rare disease he is convinced he is dying from because of an innocuous symptom he's convinced himself he's had, or constantly asking me if it looks like his veins are larger than normal, if it's normal to wake up dizzy, if it seemed his doctor really knew what he was talking about, etc. He has fully convinced himself that he is dying from all these sicknesses or blood clots, and even going to the doctor and having them give him a physical hasn't quelled his fears. It literally dominates all of our conversations.

I totally get that it is a mental illness that he is struggling with, and I'm not trying to be heartless. I've really tried being supportive, from trying to debunk some of his delusions, or reminding him to do deep breathing when he starts to have a panic attack from them. I even recently covered $100 for him to go to urgent care to get checked out when he went through one of his spirals thinking he's having a pulmonary embolism, and $50 to fill his anxiety prescription since he has been short on money (which also means he cannot afford therapy right now).

None of this has helped, and I'm at my wit's end. I don't know what else to do. I've realized I cannot help him. The other day when he was talking to me about new symptoms he's convinced he's having, I just told him flat out that I cannot listen to his delusions anymore. It's stressing me out, I'm not emotionally equipped to deal with it, and nothing I can say can convince him he's not dying, anyway. Not even a doctor can convince him. 

He was obviously hurt, and told me he wasn't looking for me to fix him, just to listen to him when he's anxious because it helps him to talk it out. But he's always asking me for medical opinions. He's stopped speaking to me altogether since then. I know he's going through a lot mentally, and cannot see a therapist right now. I just don't know how to deal with his delusions anymore. I just know I don't want to. It's starting to give me anxiety not knowing how to help him, and not wanting to say the wrong thing and make them worse.

Was I an asshole to tell him that? Am I an asshole for not just listening?. Am I the asshole?","NTA 

You are not his therapist and while he's right that he needs someone to talk to, this is way above your pay grade. It's not alright for him to place that weight on you, even if he's in a bad place. But he might not understand this in his current mental state. Stick with the boundaries you placed, but encourage him to talk to his doctor, family, and seek counseling. He may be able to find a therapist or counselor that takes payment on a sliding scale based on income.",0,0,0,0,1
24926,31532,"AITA for starting to grow tiresome of my SO?. (Throwaway just Incase) 
Some context, this is not focusing on my relationship, this is on my thoughts. 
I did not know about these issues before getting into the relationship.

I’ve been dating my SO for three years now, and for about two of them, we rarely get to go on a date anywhere. I love getting to go to their house and cuddle and watch a movie, but it’s every time nearly. We occasionally see a movie in theaters but about two-three times a year. They have pretty bad social anxiety, any time we go somewhere they’re vomiting and breaking down, even if it’s a simple trip to a local store. I never say what I think, I’m also as supportive as I can be. But in the back of my mind I’m sometimes a little disappointed and irritated that we can’t do anything new. I try to not suggest we can anywhere because of this, but sometimes when I want to go somewhere she would otherwise enjoy, I invite her. Very rarely it pans out, but once a one day beach trip did so. But this time I had somewhere I was very excited to go because she was getting to come with me. She reassured me she could go. Then that morning came, I woke up around 4 am, got ready and started driving to her house, and halfway through she canceled. I turned around, went home, and just sat there. I was very disappointed. She was belittling herself and I was getting her to stop, I reassured her I didn’t hate her, etc. She calmed down and felt better. But I feel horrible. I know she can’t help it, but AITA for being annoyed and disappointed because of this?. Am I the asshole?","NAH

Your SO has legitimate issues that they need to seek help with. It's good of you not to belittle then. In that same breath though, you shouldn't have to be sacrificing your happiness either. This is one of those situations that if SO doesn't get help, I'm not sure you should stick around",0,0,0,1,0
33931,42797,"WIBTA if I tell my roommate to stop screaming all the time. On mobile. This is kind of a tricky situation. 

I’m in college and live with 3 other girls in an apartment. We all have our own bedroom, 2 bathrooms and a shared living room and kitchen. We all get along fine and really only see each other in passing while going to class/making food/ hanging out in the living room. We’re all friendly but not friends. One of my roommates who we’ll call Lily is a junior, super hard working and majoring in something hard like computer science. She’s really smart and I admire how driven she is to be the best possible version of herself she can be. 

But there’s a problem, lily gets scared very easily. Wether she’s in the bathroom brushing her teeth and someone says “good morning” or if I’m in the kitchen and she walks out of her room, or really any possible encounter you can have while seeing a roommate in passing, she screams. Not full blown bloody murder kinda scream but just a startled, kinda loud “ahhh!” That you can hear from anywhere in the apartment. I know it’s not her fault and she can’t control it but it’s like....you live with 3 other people, you can’t constantly be startled whenever you see someone. It’s not like she lives by herself and there’s an intruder. It’s not the end of the world but it bugs me when I’m napping or focusing on homework or trying to fall asleep early and I hear her scream from being startled by the people who LIVE WITH HER.

Last year in december she kicked me out citing my lack of attention and money. After a few hours she changed her mind. I told her at that point that if she wanted another shot at our relationship she'd have to come to term with some personal issues she has (she has a history of being deceitfull and manipulative which had put some strain on our relationship at that point) and I would get a job in the mean time.

&#x200B;

The following months she kept showering me with messages about how much she missed me and how hard she was working on herself, how I was the only one for her and how much she loved me. All the while she was allready fucking some other dude.  


When we eventually got back together, she admitted to having slept with someone else, and didn't feel she had done anything wrong because we were technically on a break. I replied that if those are the moral standards she adheres too I didn't want to give our relationship a second chance. She quickly changed her tune, and said that in fact she did feel regret and felt she had done something wrong. This was February.

&#x200B;

Since then she flip flopped between saying that she was wrong and that she did nothing wrong more times than I can remember. To top it off I've had to witness how she flirted with some other guy in my presence, up until the point that I felt the need to clarify, in her stead, that she was in a relationship. I forgave this all, but she continued to switch from being regretful about her actions, to being genuinely offended by the notion that she had done something wrong. Last week we had a big fight over one of her change of hearts and she ended up agreing to seeing a therapist.   


Today she forwarded me her notes on what she would like to discuss in therapy, and in it she basically caracterizes all her issues as perceptions by me. Not even once does she own up to her actions. To me this was the final drop, so I chose this afternoon, to break up. And both her and I know that we shouldn't see eachother because it would result in a violent fight.

We started dating in high school and we stayed together in uni since we were in the same city, then we broke up a few months after we graduated. If it matters, I broke up with him. This was in 2012 and we literally haven't seen each other or talked since but we still have some mutual friends from high school and uni.


One of those mutual friends got married last month and I was in the wedding party. When he and his fiance were putting together the guest list I asked them not to invite my ex. Weddings are hard enough when you're single and I really just wanted to celebrate and enjoy my friend's wedding in peace. I didn't want to stress about running into my ex and his new wife all night. They understood and they did not invite my ex to their wedding. 


Recently I was hanging out with some friends and my ex got brought up and someone asked why he missed the wedding. The bride explained he wasn't invited because of me. I saw some of the other people exchange glances with each other like it was weird. But no one actually said anything to me.


One of my best friend is getting married at the end of the year on NYE and I'm a bridesmaid and I asked her to not invite my ex to her wedding for the same reasons. They haven't sent out invitations yet but as far as I know he will not be invited.

My LTR boyfriend is unable to attend as he has to work. No worries about that. 

However, I am organizing the event and hosting it at my house, and TBH, I’m freaking out about it. 

My stress levels are through the roof. Boyfriend understands, asked if he can help. 

I ask him to pick me up ingredients to make a dish he makes frequently. It’s super good but I’ve never been able to replicate it. He picks up the ingredients, and lets me know this by telling me I “owe him $18.50.” 

I’m flabbergasted. I don’t see the difference between buying ingredients and bringing a dish yourself and buying ingredients for me to put together. Apparently the fact that he won’t actually be there is the difference. 

He now feels I’m in a bad place financially, not being honest with him, and should have just asked for cash if that’s what I needed. 

I just think any rational human being, who happened to be my boyfriend, would “donate” $18.50 to this event without thinking twice.

I truly thought nothing of it. I feel like as an adult, I should be able to decide what I eat. I know what I like and don't like. However, it really upset my husband that I wouldn't eat it.

I told him that I'm not 5. If I don't want to eat something, I don't have to. He went on to say that if I'm an adult, I should act like one. An adult would eat it.

But she assumed it meant we were all muggles, and cried (made me feel like a real A-hole).

This all happened yesterday. My wife and I decided to talk with her and we had the classic talk, we told her it may or may not be real, depending if she believed in it or not and she took it really well and regained her interest in the series. 

Tonight I'm gonna start reading The Chamber of the Secrets to her. But yeah I guess IFU a little but it didnt go wrong at all.

Edit 2: She will eventually know its all fiction, but my main goal is for her to be interested in literature an to use her imagination as much as she can. She is just a child and we think its the best for her.. Am I the asshole?","YTA- NOT for saying ur muggles but for saying its real in the first place

Edit: everyone keeps bringing up santa.
As i already said in another comment here is the difference 

“Yah but here is the difference. When saying santa is real they then CAN follow up by faking presents  when easter bunny they can fake it by hiding eggs.
There IS NOT a way to fake the harry potter stuff except to say what he did which is that they are muggles”",1,1,0,0,0
17082,21736,"AITA for yelling at a co-worker for not washing his hands after going to the bathroom?. Today I (M) walked into the bathroom to use the urinal. Just as I’m finishing up and doing my “shakes” I hear one of the stall doors open and someone walking out. I hear a few more foot steps and then the door to the restroom opening and closing.  No running water from a faucet, no sound of a paper towel being pulled from a dispenser. 

Without thinking i quickly zipped up, ran to the door, opened it up, and poked my head out. The bathrooms are down a little hallway about 20 feet long that lead to the break area so it was pretty obvious the guy I saw walking into the break area with his back to me was the same guy who was just in the bathroom. I yelled “Hey! Next time wash your hands! That’s gross!” He turned and looked at me wide eyed and when I was turning back to go wash my own hands, I noticed there were 3 or 4 people in the break area who looked at me and then at him. I washed my hands, dried them, and when I came outside, both the hallway and break area were empty.

I don’t work directly with this guy but I saw him about an hour later as I was walking to lunch and he literally turned around and went the other way when he saw me. 

I’m not a total germaphobe...in fact my wife accuses me of being gross sometimes. But in a common area like the workplace, the least you could do is run your hands through some water to make it seem like you’re being somewhat sanitary. I kind of feel bad though for calling him out in front of other people....but if he did this once, I’m sure he does it all the time. And that’s just...gross.

A friend (Host) of my friend (Emily) invited the group back to his apartment to keep the party going. I had not met Host prior till tonight. During the course of the party, Host is playing music from his computer which is on a desk in the main room. Host kept his scanner on the floor next to this desk. 

People kept adding songs to the play list. Someone had placed a glass of wine on the computer desk and when I went to add some songs I accidentally knocked the wine on the scanner. I immediately apologized and helped clean up. Party went on and we all eventually left. 

The next day Host texts me (got number from Emily) and asks me to pay for the scanner. Host has said he just got the scanner as gift for his bday. He looked up the price and said it was $350. I said that was a lot but offered to pay $100. Host got super pissed texting me that I’m TA. I told him that I was being nice to send him any money but someone has ruined a rug at my apartment and I didn’t ask for anything because that’s a risk of hosting. I sent the money and blocked his number. 

Emily texts me angrily saying I WBTA for not paying the rest and that she and one of the other mutual friends would have to pay the difference if I didn’t.

His birthday was two months ago and I got him a video game he wanted, an expensive piece of artwork he liked, and being an out of state college student I flew from my home across the country to him and stayed with him for a few days till school started 

I don’t regret what I did and I did not expect him to do anything of the sort for me, just make me a handmade card or something physical and tangible to prove how much he cares about me. Even flowers or something small

Hes not from an affluent family at all and a lot of his checks go to his mom but I didn’t want anything that involved a lot of $!!! 

He got me a cake from an ice cream shop because he felt bad that he didn’t get me anything which was sweet but I don’t like cake and I lost a lot of weight so I also don’t want to eat it because I am maintaining and would rather eat something unhealthy that I like. 

My friend visited from back home and she ended up being the highlight of my day, I got great gifts from my roommate and another friend so I’m not salty more so hurt that my friends thought to do something but my boyfriend of 1 year did not.

He asked me to his girlfriend on my birthday last year so not even anything for that either. I guess it’s something to takeaway that maybe I shouldn’t do so much in the future for his birthday which makes me sad because I did  what I wanted to do then, so I should not regret it now.

12080,15471,"WIBTA for leaving a poor review for a car salesman?. Background: was in a wreck and car was totaled. Husband and I are looking for a car equal to what we're getting back from insurance, but we took out an auto loan so we can get a replacement before our rental runs out. We'll pay it back when we have the payout. We found a car that met all our criteria, but it was two hours away. We called to set up an appointment for Saturday, but he said he expected the car to sell by then. So we made plans to go up yesterday after work. His website shows that he offers financing (important), so I called him back and told him we would be there by the time they close and that we already have financing through our bank so it would be a quick buy. He said okay.

So we drive two hours, look at the car, test drive, talk it over, and decide to buy it. I pull out the financing paperwork and he says he doesn't know how to do it. I told him it's straight forward and that I can email it to him. He said he doesn't work with banks. I pointed out that I told him on the phone that we financed through the bank, and he told me that he didn't hear that part and if he had, he would have told us not to come. So I asked why his website offers financing, and he said that he doesn't actually accept those applications. I asked if he would make an exception since we drove so far, and he said no because he didn't want to do the title work and wait for the money. He then made some snide comment about how it was obvious that we didn't have cash and it would go to someone else who does. So we left.

I can't decide if I want to leave a review for him. On one hand, the car was in good shape and at a very good price. On the other hand, I feel like his website is misleading and he didn't handle the situation well when there was a misunderstanding. He claims he didn't hear me say anything about financing, but I has no reason to believe he dealt in cash only (nothing on his website indicated that).  If I left a review, it would be more of an ""FYI"" type deal, but I honestly can't decide if that would be helpful/appropriate or if it just makes me a bitter asshole. . Am I the asshole?","NTA

It was pretty upsetting for both sides, but no one was unfaithful and no one was really to blame. It just broke down. She moved out and left him, but tried to get back together a few times. He refused and eventually they got divorced. But he remains very bitter to this day, despite her trying to get back together a few times and wanting things to work. It was like he couldn’t get past her leaving him in first place. 

I was good friends with A first before he met B, but after myself and B had babies at sane time we developed a strong friendship. He encourages this, as B had moved from another city and he wanted her to have local friends. Myself and B still keep in touch to this day, even though she moved back to her home town.  At the end of the day noone was in the wrong, there is no need to take sides. These are two adults who decoded to separate and friends are not an asset to split. I dont talk to her about him or him about her. We have other friends that have split up and its not been problem like this. 

The problem is A doesn’t see it like that,  he thinks my being friends with B is disloyal and it makes him very angry. 
Over last few years he has shouted at me, unfriended me on FB,  sent nasty texts (twice while I was on two separate holidays with my husband and family), Jibes at me in-front of other friends or in what’s app groups, stormed out of a house party in tears etc. Citing that I am still friends with his ex. 
He has blocked me on FB repeatedly (as he apologises and friend requests me and I end up accepting it). Only for him to do it again.

We were sitting next to each other in study hall and he started talking to me about a tv show that I don’t watch, so I was getting bored with the conversation. I tried to change the subject a couple of times but he didn’t notice (pretty typical of him and I guess most people with autism?), so finally I just said, “Hey, I’m sorry but this topic isn’t interesting to me, can we talk about something else?” He just said, “Sure, what do you want to talk about?” and I brought up something that had happened at school recently and we kept talking about that. He didn’t seem to be upset or offended.

When I was leaving class, my teacher pulled me aside and told me that what I said to Isaac was very rude and it wasn’t okay to treat him like he’s lesser just because he’s different.

44148,55449,"AITA for “leaving my sister out”?. I’ll preface this by saying my sister and I are both 17f, but we’re very different people with slightly different friend groups.

So I’d just gotten back from a college visit yesterday, and four of my friends had made a Snapchat group message asking if we wanted to go to the movies yesterday. I happily agreed as I hadn’t seen some of them in awhile. The only problem was, my sister wasn’t included in the group message.

My friends picked me up, and we had gone to see the movie, and we all had so much fun. I just got back though and my mom sat me down and talked about how I should’ve asked if my sister could go too as she had felt really left out that she wasn’t invited. Her future roommate was part of the group as well, and that particularly hurt her feelings. 

But as I’d mentioned before we’re very different people with different personalities and senses of humor. She never really meshed well with that specific group (minus her roommate). Also about half of my friends were LGBT and they were really the only ones I could talk and joke about my sexuality with and just feel free about it as my sister was never really comfortable with it. That’s a whole other post though.

I do feel bad that she wasn’t invited and my mom said I’d have to ask if she could come too the next time we did something. However I just feel we wouldn’t have had as much fun if we did. I do love my sister though and I feel the need to say that. AITA in this situation though?. Am I the asshole?","NTA

15475,19745,"AITA for not moving to the pull out couch until I was asked nicely. 

I’m at a hotel with my family for a gathering this weekend, and I’m sharing a room with my sister.   The room has one bed and one pull out couch. I arrived with my father a few hours before my mother and sister arrived, so I set my stuff up on the bed. 

When my sister arrived my mother asked something along the lines of “I assume you are on the bed because your sister was last time”, which my sister responded to with “no, I was on the couch last time” which I am fairly certain is true, although it has been almost a year and a half since last time we shared a hotel room so I’m not totally sure.

My first response to this was that in the long history of us sharing hotel rooms I was almost always on the floor or couch, but I didn’t think it was that big a deal. I initially offered to switch with her on the second night, which they both shut down very quickly saying that last time I had the bed both nights ( I’m pretty sure we were only there one night)

I mentioned that I didn’t care that much where I was but they had yet to politely ask me to move. All they did was make points as to why my sister was more deserving of it than me, and they shouldn’t have to ask because I wasn’t entitled to it. It’s not just that they hadn’t said please or anything, they hadn’t directly asked at all. I’m pressured into shit all the time by them so while I don’t think where I sleep is a huge deal, I felt like a bit of respect would have been nice this time.

I decided I wanted to be clear about this, and said that I would happily move, but it would like to be asked first. My mom once again talked how she shouldn’t have to ask at all, and after a few minutes of that my sister asked in a very exasperated tone if I would please move. I said I would be happy to and switched spots with her.

For context me and me sister are both college age, she’s two years older than me, and have had a slightly rocky relationship most of our lives, though things have been going better lately.  I know this might seem a bit childish or petty, but as the younger kid I don’t tend to get much respect and I sort of felt like I would like some instead of just backing down immediately like I usually do..

51554,64679,"WIBTA if I didn't invite two members of our rec league volleyball team back next season because they suck?. I played rec league volleyball for the winter and spring seasons at the invite of a friend of mine who was captain of the team. After the spring season ended, we took a break for summer and tentatively planned on getting the team going again in the fall.

A week ago I asked our captain about signing up for the fall season and she said she wouldn't be able to play.

Two of our teammates from winter/spring are pretty low skill. None of us are great by any means, but it's pretty obvious who the weak links are halfway through each game and then the other team focuses them for easy points and we lose. Winter season I believe we went 0/10 and spring our record was 1/10. Yay for improvement.

When our previous captain bailed I thought awesome, I can make my own team, quietly exclude them, nobody's feelings are hurt, and maybe we win more than 1 in 20 games. I invited 2 solid members from the previous team and 3 new members. I doubted either of the low skill players would attempt to captain the old team.

Today low skill player #1 sends a group message asking if we're all down for fall season. Old captain says no, low skill player #2 says yes. From the context, it seems like low skill player #1 wants to captain the team in place of the old captain.

I feel like my options are:

1) Tell a white lie along the lines of ""someone else asked me to be on their team, sorry"". But what if #1 still ends up getting a team together? If she sees solid players #1 and #2 on my team it will be easy to see I excluded them. Solid player #1 also works with low skill player #1, and would have to back up my lie.

2) Tell them I started a new team and intentionally excluded them because they drag us down. This would suck. they're both lovely people, and I feel like no matter what they'd be hurt.

3) Invite them to my team, lose every single game, and decrease the fun had by every other member of the team.

TLDR: I quietly didn't invite two low skill players from my previous team to a newly formed team I put together.

We have been dating for only four months, but we have very long breaks from college (two months) and are relatively long-distance so we haven't seen each other very much for the last while. I really like her so I have tried really hard to keep in contact with her.

My problem is this: she works literally all the time. I didn't notice at first, then one day she mentioned to me that she stayed at work til 4am after starting at 8 in the morning. She told me recently she works 4 days a week for 10 or 12 hours and 2 days a week for 4 hours. She is also studying to be an accountant so on her shorter days and her days off she helps at an office. She also has a lot of university work to complete and has told me she is worried she won't get it done but estimates she then spends about 3 hours on study per day. She has started sleeping over at work and when we Skype I have noticed she lost quite a lot of weight, but says she has not had a chance to exercise at all.

She brushed it off but I insisted and said I was concerned about her and that I thought she needed to cut back on hours and work less.

So I agreed to go to an out of town wedding with my boyfriend, and a few weeks in advance I asked what I should wear. I didn't own a suit, and wanted to know if slacks and a button down would be too casual. I had plenty of money to be able to afford a suit, and as an adult man it would be reasonable for me to have one anyway.  He told me that it would be totally fine, I didn't need a suit. 

Flash forward to the night before we leave for the wedding, we're packing and I notice he's packing a suit.  I said I thought we didn't need suits and he said I'd still be fine without one, but he was going to wear one.  This got me concerned that I'd be really underdressed.  I asked him if he could please not wear a suit, since I still didn't have one and had no way to get one in time.  I assumed this would be fine, since he told me it'd be okay not to wear one in the first place.  He probably just didn't realize that I'd feel a lot more comfortable: I knew that if we were dressed to the same level, I'd feel less out of place (you know, solidarity and all that). I didn't know anyone at the wedding and am just self conscious about being over/under dressed to things generally.  To my surprise, he outright refused.  He said HE'D feel underdressed and out of place at a wedding without a suit. We argued about it for awhile, and at the end of the day he still refused to dress down at all.

This hurt my feelings quite a bit because it felt like he was choosing appearances over my feelings.  Essentially he'd rather me feel underdressed than him, even when he told it'd be fine in the first place.  If he wouldn't feel comfortable without a suit, why would he tell me I'd be okay without one? I couldn't (and still don't) understand--if the roles were reversed, I'd dress down in a heartbeat.

I recognize that this is a small deal, it sounds silly even writing it, but to me that almost makes it worse--I was having a ton of anxiety about it, and it seems like such a small thing for him to just dress down to the level he told me was reasonable.  On the other hand, I wonder if I'm the asshole for being hurt and making such a big deal out of this, because it's his decision to wear what he wants to wear and I shouldn't be trying to control that even if it WOULD make me feel a lot more comfortable?

45406,57013,"WIBTA :- For refusing to donate my kidney to my nephew.. (OR, refuse to even check out if my kidney is a suit.)

So, I am 22(M) and have a nephew 8(M) who is genuinely a good kid and close to me.

Around last year, nephew started to have some complications with his health and after having it checked out. Basically in laymen terms, both his kidneys have failed and he is in need of a transplant (Due to some complications dialysis wasn't feasable). 

Due to this complication both his parents and mine have checked out their suitability and none of them were a match. This has left just me in their close family. 

But, I want neither to check or donate my organ and I have reasons, let me explain:-

I don't want to donate because frankly I am selfish and scared. I had always dreamt of being in army and have been in the defense academy for 3 years with last semester left. And if I donated any organs it will lead me to disqualify based on medical and will seriously hamper my whole life ( I don't have any useful degree that would help me in civilian life).

I don't want to get myself checked out for suitability because if I am a match, I know that I won't be able to live with myself knowing that I could have helped out my nephew..

She’s always been very awkward with reading words sometimes, which I find cute and attractive but causes discomfort for her in social settings. She has test anxiety and “hears voices” during tests and quizzes in school. Her grades in school aren’t great, but she has three years of college left and is trying to get a merit based scholarship. She’s always joked she has schizophrenia, but never has been diagnosed or gone to a specialist. Just recently when she was reading something to me, I asked if she has ever diagnosed with dyslexia as a child. She said no, but after further research the symptoms of dyslexia are pretty much what she describes. I suggested she go to a medical expert and see if there’s any treatment, which would help her grades and anxiety. She’s been mad at me for a week, and is going on a depressive spiral because she thinks she’s “broken”.

60499,75920,"WIBTA for revealing all?. (Throwaway)

A few years ago in junior year, I got on really well with this girl (Billy) and some of her friends. We all became this big group and I got closer to her too. Kinda accidentally got big feelings for her despite the fact she was with someone super serious and she felt the same. We kinda had like a cat and mouse thing and did some casual stuff.

Obvs, it made shit super complicated and like I know nothing should've happened since she was with someone but with how I felt about her, couldn't really let it go. It got super hard to talk because emotions were constantly running high and we didn't know how to deal with it, eventually I sort of got with someone else as an out. 

Long story short there, girl was super toxic for me and the group. Constantly lying to me and making shit up and when I found out and left it behind, she stayed with them. They'd bought into the whole shit but then later on did a 180 after a friend of mine clamped down on it and they tried to bring me back in.

I legit tried to fit in but it was clear that my mind set was different and the rest of the friends except Billy weren't happy with me really being there. In my eyes, it didn't really have anything to do with the rest of them so I ignored it and tried my best to just sort shit and have a normal friendship.

Fast forward some life and shit, eventually I realised it wasn't going to work well, I was fed up with her bringing all the past stuff over my head when all I had done was try and make everyone happy and do my best to sort things out after. Along came a situation that proved she wasn't a good friend to me and I left that part of the group entirely.

A few weeks ago, started getting some rumblings that they weren't happy with me being around some of the people still and eventually they've started petty shit to single me out and make me want to leave and feel like shit. Close to sort of just outing all the shit so it's out there and I don't feel pent up by all this history.

I found her to be a bit odd during our first shift together. She only made very fleeting eye contact with me and shouted at me, when I was just rambling a few rethorical questions to myself. Anyway, she was nice enough overall, and I just thought she's an odd teenager. She also told me that she doesn't want to answer the phone, which is about 50% of the job. We respond to emails, sell tickets to walk-ins and to people over the phone. She has her own phone next to her computer, but she said that she doesn't feel comfortable talking to people over the phone, because she can't see their facial expressions, which slightly annoyed me, because that meant that I had to take all of her calls, on top of mine, and that many calls simply would not be answered.

Later, when I closed up, another coworker told me that the girl was apparently the owner's daughter and that she had asperbergers.

Since before our wedding day we've had an inside joke.

When we first met I was unemployed and she was a waitress, but she did some modelling for her boyfriend at the time, a photographer. Within a couple years we were dating and after we got together I'd gotten an internship at a company that turned into a full time, well paying job, while she had started working as a teacher in a public school.

Since my internship turned into a full time job I earned more than her, about 2.5x what she does on average. When we were planning our wedding she said we should start saving for x, y, and z, and I said I could pay for all of it right now. She said something like ""oh my god I'm a trophy wife"" but she laughed when she said it and she found the situation funny.

It's become a recurring joke whenever our income is mentioned or I have a work event that she comes to that she jokingly refers to herself as a ""trophy wife"" due to the difference in income and the number of events where she ends up being my plus one. I've made the joke myself in private more than once, and she's always found it funny.

Then last night I had another work thing, she got dressed up and came with me, and I made the joke in front of a female coworker I was friends with. I don't remember the exact phrasing now but my wife offered to get us each another drink while we talked, and I replied in a way that used the phrase ""trophy wife"" in a way that was clearly joking, and my wife laughed and explained ""it's an inside joke"" plus a summary of the joke to my coworker, but the coworker looked a bit put off.

She waited until my wife left and then gave me a verbal beat down over how I referred to my wife. I repeated that it was just a joke when my wife came back. My coworker glared at me for the rest of tonight and again today but it's not had any further repercussions, and I told my wife what happened and asked if she was alright with my joke and she said she thought it was funny.

So I started secretly applying and good luck hit me. A place I interviewed in the past at reached out and invited me for an interview- I got the job!! Huge pay raise and in my field of Geri psych. How could I say no. 

The catch is; they need me to start in 13 days. I can't give a two weeks notice. So I chose to give a one week's notice and just slide for a long weekend. 

My supervisor was upset. She said I would not be eligible for rehire (lol, bummer) nor could she write me a reference. The thing is, though, I have a copy of my 90 day report- which is a glowing recommendation.  So I have that locked down. 

It feels like an A move because I love my clients but...I don't want to postpone my start date.

6757,8630,"AITA for deleting a friend from snapchat. Hey guys, so here's some backstory 

About three weeks ago I met a guy who I ended up liking a lot. We seemed to get along great and though he was upfront about not wanting a relationship I thought the possibility for a friendship or FWB situation was still something worth perusing. So I got his phone number and snapchat info and we ended up hooking up the following weekend.

Then after we slept together he became very distant. Whenever I'd send him messages over snapchat he'd either respond with one word answers or not at all. I figured I needed to get the hint and stop messaging him cause he just wasn't interested(which I did). 

However, every 2-3 days he'd send me a snap of something really random whether it was a picture of just him, him petting his dog or him driving in his car. At first I thought maybe I was wrong before and that he actually wanted to keep in touch with me but whenever I'd respond to his messages he'd go back to one word answers.

These conversations typically only lasted 5 minutes with about 3-5 messages being exchanged before he  would just stop replying. During which he would typical ask when he'd be available to hang out and he would give typical blow off answers. 

So, like I said before, this has been going on for three weeks and has been really frustrating for me partially cause I do like him but also cause I don't understand his reasons for messaging me. I mean if he doesn't want to hang out again and has no interest in holding a decent conversation with me, why even bother messaging me? 

Here's where the AITA part of the story kicks in. 

After putting up with this for three weeks, I decided that even though I still like this guy he's more of a stress on my life instead of a joy and decided to end things myself by deleting his number and snapchat info from my phone. 

My question is AITA for cutting him out of my life without giving him any warning?

29106,36766,"WIBTA for not returning the dog I have owned for over 3 years?. Okay, this is a weird post, and the title is pretty odd, so stick with me.

&#x200B;

A friend of mine left (let's call him Al) enlisted in the military in the summer of 2018, and has a contract that will last 4 years.  Al had a dog he had a dog that he had owned for 1.5 years that he left with his parents upon shipping out. However, about 5-6 months in (around Holiday season 2018 now), his parents decided that they weren't able to care for their dogs anymore, and needed to re-home all of them, Al's dog included. I volunteered to adopt Al's dog, and ended up taking the boy home before Christmas 2018. His family gave me the supplies that they had (crate, leash, some leftover dog food, etc.) and sent me on my way. Ever since, I caring for the dog entirely on my own, from vet bills to food and anything else that he may need.

&#x200B;

However, the problem is that he said he wanted his dog back when he got back from his time in the military, and I agreed. Since then, I have found it increasingly difficult to imagine separating from this dog and returning it to Al, because after 10 or so months I am so incredibly attached to the dog, and he and I have formed a very strong bond/relationship. I know that I won't be able to turn over the dog after living with him for 3 and a half years. I know I agreed to returning the dog if Al wanted him back upon returning, but I don't know how he expects me to own and raise this dog for over double the time he owned him and then be able to return it to him. I'm incredibly torn on this issue, and I don't know what to do, Reddit.

Al and I have not discussed me returning the dog once since I adopted him, only the initial agreement.

I have a GREAT relationship with both my parents so I was looking forward to spending more time with them before moving away.

I was at a store with my boyfriend and was putting the cart to the opposite side of the cash register, where it goes past the employee’s back while they ring your stuff. Usually I take our stuff out before putting it to that side, but I sometimes put it there as I take our stuff out of the cart, if we only have a few items. I feel like it speeds things up. We only had 6 small items, so it was going to be a quick job.

There’s an employee with his back turned, who’s assisting the cashiers. I hear my boyfriend say “wait, are you serious?”

I don’t know what’s going on, he says “are you seriously trying to make them take our stuff out for us?”.

I don’t know what he means, and am just like “what”, then I realize he thinks I’m putting the cart there to go through without putting anything on the belt myself, and am going to make the helpers take all our stuff out.

I’m still positioning the cart, but by this time, he’s gotten the attention of the helper guy who had his back turned. He pointed at him “you’re going to make him do it?” and then the employee starts taking our stuff out. I’m just like “no, no, it’s ok”. My boyfriend reads his name tag, “I’m so sorry Jason”, as I’m still positioning the cart and hurrying to take things out because he’s making me feel like an asshole. Meanwhile he’s apologizing to the employee profusely, for the trouble.

I felt like this was incredibly humiliating but he told me that I needed to learn how to take a joke and that it was just banter. I was on the verge of crying when this was happening, though he didn’t know that. I ended up being incredibly pissed over it, and called him an asshole, and when he said that I just needed to learn to take a joke and that it was “subjectively funny”, not an objectively asshole thing to do. Things really exploded and it turned into a pretty heated argument.

He still says it was a joke and that I need to get a sense of humor.

So basically, my grandma is coming to stay with us at Christmas, and she can't walk up and down stairs so she is unable to stay in my or 1st sisters room. So I told my grandma she could sleep in 2nd sisters room as it downstairs. But now 2nd sister refuses to clean her room so grandma can stay in there. Her room is filled with rubbish and its disgusting. I have brought up this problem with my mother who keeps ignoring me which is pretty normal reaction for her when i try and talk about things. So now my grandma is upset she has no where to stay and has said she will go upstairs and use a bucket at night if she needs. Now when i was told this I was furious that my 2nd sister is willing for my grandma to do this. I argued with my mother again as I've been told I'm not allowed to talk to 2nd sister about this directly. And my mum has come up with the idea to put me and my 1st sister in the same room and my mum and dad sleep in my 1st sisters room. and my grandma sleeps in my parents room. All because they won't force my 28 year old sister to clean her room. it should be noted that the reason she also refuses is because ""she has to work"". She works evenings at a supermarket.

7570,9624,"AITA For claiming a saw isn't an electric tool?. This is more of ""are we the assholes"" but it happened a few hours ago and I'm still a bit confused about how it turned into such a heated debate (names have been changed to protect the innocent yada yada).  
 
So a few friends and I were playing a card game called Anomia. 
 
The gist of the game is you flip over cards with various descriptors (a dinosaur, a noun, a jazz musician, etc.), if two or more cards from two or more players have the same symbol, the first person to blurt out a correct matching answer for a card (someone says velociraptor for a dinosaur card) gets the card/a point.  
 
So two cards came up between two of my friends, and one of them was ""electric tool.""  

My one friend Connor said ""saw.""   
Now there were 6 of us in total playing. Four of us (myself included) believed that was not a good enough answer.   
Connor and my other friend Joel disagreed... vehemently.  
 
Connor and Joel's argument was that a saw can be used as a general term to describe an electric saw, and therefore should be considered an electric tool, while we argued that you need to be more specific when the card is asking for an ""electric"" tool. They specifically used the example of the word ""phone"" - would you differentiate between a rotary phone and a cell phone or would you just call both of them ""phones""? 
 
We debated this for a while and the conversation got more and more heated, to the point where several of us nearly left the table out of sheer exasperation.  
 
I wanted to move on with the game so I offered the option to remove the card from the game so no one would win. Joel once again vehemently disagreed. Joel seemed to take the matter a lot more personally than the rest of us and would not let it go. 

Finally we put it to a vote, and unsurprisingly Connor and Joel were outvoted.
 
The rest of the game had a cloud hanging over it, and Joel remained sullen for the remainder of it.   

Afterwards, on the way to my car I asked Connor why Joel got so upset. He said that me and the others were shooting down his rebuttals and weren't considering his opinion enough.    
 
I really don't get that because to me it felt like we were just trying to get this over with and continue with the game and he was turning it into a personal attack on his intelligence. I even found out later that Joel snuck the card to Connor in the middle of the game out of spite. 
 
So yeah, were we the assholes here?

I was born into this religion, so were my parents, and 3 out of 4 of my grandparents, although as of right now we are all part of it.

My grandparents on my father's side basically raised me and until now me, my parents, and my siblings still live with them, along with my 2 aunts (father's sisters) who are both now married.

This means that I am effectively still under my grandparents ""jurisdiction"" in the eyes of this church. My grandparents both hold positions in this religion and if I were to leave it their positions will be removed from them and they can't have them back. A lot of my other relatives on my father's side also hold various offices but they won't really be as affected. However from what I remember people within the religion aren't really allowed to talk to those expelled from it or have a good relationship with them in any way so I will effectively lose my family unless they disobey, though I am unsure how strictly it is enforced if it is at all. Also everyone within the church will know since they announce expelled people at the end of church services so yeh.

The only reason I want to leave this religion is because the more I listen to their teachings the more I see that my values and my views varies  from theirs greatly. This distresses me alot especially since here we are basically required to attend church on the specified day and time. 

I feel like it is a very selfish reasoning and my entire family, even my siblings will forever be impacted but the more I stay in this religion the more bitter and resentful I become of it. I don't agree with even most of their basic teachings and every time I am required to attend I hear them and I just get so...I don't know a good word in English for it but basically I get all emotional and angry.

We’ll call him “Aaron.” She talked about it in a group chat, but she didn’t really say anything about whether it was going well or how she was feeling about the date. Many of the girls in our group chat were saying things like “happy for you!!” or “Aaron is so great!” 

While I’m glad that Cathy is dating someone and it appears to be going alright, I have another, non-mutual friend who dated Aaron a few years ago. Aaron cheated on her, and their relationship ended horribly. I didn’t know my other friend at the time, so I am just hearing what she and others have said about the end of that relationship. (Someone close to Aaron had corroborated the fact that he did, in fact, cheat on my friend.)

This is getting confusing, so here is my question: Would I be the asshole if I told Cathy in private that Aaron has a history of cheating? I wouldn’t be mean about it, I would just want to warn Cathy before she gets too invested.

28491,35992,"AITA for quitting my job despite my employer's investment in me?. So two years ago I started my first job working for a small company (25 people ish) as their trainee CAD Technician. I was contracted to do 40 hours with opportunities for overtime, and my duties were drawing and admin responsibilities.

However over the last year, my roles have shifted to manual labor i.e. lifting and carrying material. It also became my responsibility to clean the office, employee and manager toilets. They don't want a 'blue collar 9-5 guy' so I'd sometimes clean up and vacuum off the clock. I was also told to do 'homework' once a week which would consist of completing a drawing to be sent to a client. I did not get any overtime payment for this.

About 6 months ago I was informed that my college was ceasing my course and that I needed to attend a new college, 5 days a week, and that I now needed to work most Saturdays and to book them off as holiday if I have plans. This is a problem as I have family responsibilities as I'm the only one who drives.

About two weeks ago I didn't inform the manager I couldn't do that Saturday (I thought he'd give me notice been as it was overtime) and he got very mad, telling me that I had to book Saturdays off from now. The Ops manager told me to expect him to vent his anger' next time he sees me.

I got home extremely upset and sought advice from my family who told me to contact my college liaison officer. I scheduled meetings with my employer and attended either with my father or liaison officer to confront my manager about the overtime situation as well as the unpaid homework and toilet cleaning. 

My manager lied saying he never said I had to book off overtime and also told my liaison that there was a toilet cleaning timetable for everyone (utter bs).

He also told me that carrying out paid work from home 'just doesn't work' because they prefer to discuss projects in person rather than emails. 

My liaison officer sided with my manager saying that he'd invested a lot of time and money and I should be indebted to him for that. She also suggested in a meeting that I thought I was the only one cleaning toilets was because I had Asbergers' syndrome ( I do not). 

I had a meeting with my employer today who told me I had betrayed is trust in me and that I was wrong to go behind his back and seek help from family and liaison officer. I told him I no longer want to work for the company as the role advertised is different and I do not see myself having a future there. I will be recieving my notice of dismissal tomorrow.

For a bit of clarification we started dating in the summer time.

I've asked her about it, where she got it, stuff like that (I was afraid it was a ex's hoodie.) She's told me it's a comfort thing, and she feels secure with it on/around her.

I don't like it, it goes down to her knees and is super baggy, not in a cute way. It looks like she's wearing a potato sack. I've offered her my hoodies, offered to buy her a new hoodie, offered it have it hemmed (my sister is a seamstress) but she refuses all of it. 
It's become a regular thing we argue about, especially if we want to go somewhere nice or upscale for a date. A few days ago we got into a massive fight about it at my house.

43269,54310,"AITA for raising the red flags for a sketchy ""job offer""?. So to begin with the story, here's the context: 

&#x200B;

I am a recent graphic design graduate that had been relocated to Portland, OR for a month. I am currentlyliving with my aunt while trying to find a job here. I have sent multiple job applications here and there, but what I got back are either irrelevant (real estate sales agents, commission based insurance salesperson etc.) or just outright scams. So I am excited to heard back from the company that I have applied to over on LinkedIn. 

&#x200B;

The company in question is a prominent nationwide construction company, and they have a UI/UX opening posted. When  I received the job offer email, I was excited, thinking that the search is finally over. However, upon second inspection, I noticed that there are something off. (Details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c4fv94/a\_legit\_job\_offeror\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c4fv94/a_legit_job_offeror_not/); TL;DR: The email is coming from a Gmail address \[for a nationwide construction company!\] and they are asking for a Google Hangouts chat interview) Having read articles in the past about job scams, my alarm is ringing like crazy at this point. So I decided to forward the email to my aunt, but she said there's nothing wrong about the supposed ""job interview"", and instead called me out for being stubborn to forfeit the ""opportunity"". So in order to find proof, I decided to do some detective work on my own and call the company in question as well (and recorded the conversation for good measure) as forwarding the email to my college's career adviser. The HR lady of the company indeed confirmed my suspicion as she told me that they have never posted a UI/UX opening and it was a scammer impersonating them. My college advisor also noticed the discrepancy and advised me not to go forward with the ""interview"". So I decided to forward it to my aunt, and you think she would accept my argument, right? 

&#x200B;

WRONG. She still isn't convinced, and she even rebuked to me by saying ""what did it waste? 2 minutes? I don't need proof (that it's a scam)"". At this point she feels like I am really pushing her button and she's ""90% done with me"", but in reality I have been finding jobs here and there to no avail. Now I can't risk to burn my only bridge here in the US, as I came here on my student Visa and currently pending my OPT. So my question to all of you is, am I the asshole for standing up to my uneasy feelings about a potential trap? Or am I being rebellious to defy my aunt?

I’m 24 and I’m an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

She’s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

She also met her fiancé two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He’s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through. 

Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I “didn’t bring anything in”.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn’t I, and I tell him not to touch me. 

He tells me to “calm down” and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he’s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn’t want to throw me out but he “will if he has to.” I told him that he’s trying to look tough but it’s just making him look stupid.

I just went to go find a seat after that.

45004,56517,"AITA for being frustrated?. So here’s the story. I’m (21F) getting married in September and my mother-in-law is making my life as difficult as possible when it comes to planning the food. My parents have paid for everything thus far, including the venue, the caterer, the alcohol, all the decorations,  my dress & alterations, a hotel room for us, etc. 

The only thing I have asked my in-laws to take care of is the dessert. We’re doing cupcakes (it’s a small wedding and the cost is under $200). My in-laws make considerably more than my parents and I know money isn’t an issue for them. 

The problem is that my MIL is notoriously selfish and has to make everything about her. When we decided on a pork dish for dinner, she threw a fit because she doesn’t like pork. So we added a beef option, literally only to please her. Keeping in mind that she isn’t even the one paying for it. 

Now, she’s complaining about how we aren’t catering to her fairweather gluten and dairy “intolerances”. It’s only an issue when she wants it to be, like my wedding, and when it’s not convenient for her, she has no problems eating it. She just ordered pizza hut the other night and had breadsticks and cheese pizza with zero complaints or issues. So she’s throwing a fit about the cupcakes because they aren’t gluten and dairy free. However, when we brought home leftovers from the tastings she ate them without issue and said they were delicious. 

Maybe this seems insensitive of me, but I’m a very picky eater and I have gone hungry at every single wedding I’ve been to. It doesn’t seem fair to have to change our entire menu to suit one person who doesn’t even have issues. I wouldn’t ask anyone to do that for me.

1. we need to be able to follow the account 
2. We need all login information, and updates when the login changes. 

Although it’s required, we rarely check their social media. We would like them to behave themselves as if we are watching. 

Recently we found out that my wife’s daughter (16) has a secret Instagram account. The Instagram account has around nine thousand subscribers. The pictures that she posts on this account do not look like her *at all*. They are highly edited and quite inappropriate. She looks 25, not 16. 

Wife and I took the phone when we found out. We have since gone through her messages to see A LOT of inappropriate messages, and the fact that she has done two sponsored posts recently.  We took the phone for a while as we were trying to figure out an appropriate punishment. 

I suggested that the account be shut down, and she can’t have a new one for a couple of months. Wife didn’t agree. It honestly seems to me as if she was proud of this. She didn’t take it seriously at all, and was dilly dallying about coming up with a punishment. I thought I’d take matters into my own hands, so I posted a series of pictures of her where she actually looks like a kid. School pictures, family pictures etc. She lost a few followers over a couple of days. 

When I gave her the phone back she had a complete melt down. She is acting like I ruined her life. She is talking about how she may not be able to do the sponsored posts and she is being bullied. I told her she can always delete the account. Wife found out and got very angry with me. She even told me that this was not a parenting job for me and I should have left her to deal with it.

19208,24460,"AITA for not wanting to write an animal watching review for my ex?. TLDR @ bottom.

I [M30] broke up with my ex [F27] just before Valentine's day. We are on lease at a two bedroom apartment, and stay out of each other's way. It's basically come down to me moving in with my parents at the end of April and splitting my half of the rent so we can try to move on.

I've tried to keep thing quite and drama free. But last night she asked if I could write her a review for animal watching. I have seen her take care of co-workers pets. She did well with a bunny, feeding it twice a day. And I helped with a cat by going over myself after work one day. Those examples are good.

But for dogs... I took a lot of responsibility for. We would watch her roommate's dog or my step Brothers dog. I felt I took most of the walk duty. This eventually burdened me when she wanted to get a dog. We are on the 4th floor. I can't handle that by myself, so I warn her and she assures me she will help. But next dog sitting we had, she bailed on a promise to walk it before bed, saying she will take early morning. That didn't happen either.

On top of that, I really feel she has negected her cat after the break up. I love this cat and happy to take care of it, but when it tries to play with her, she ignored it and even locks it out of her room. It's really disheartening. She doesn't want to change the litter since I took on that chore, and is expecting me to refill his water fountain.

So when she asked me for a review, I ignored at first. When she followed up, I said ""sorry, you should ask people you pet sat for"".
She has said ""I dunno why you're being difficult but whatever."" ""But if you don't feel like helping for whatever reason, that's fine."" And ended with ""I just don't understand why you have to continue to make my life difficult"". 

I've said nothing in response. She doesn't need this review for money, she has a better job than I do, and recently just accepted a job offer after turning down a promotion. Lastly I fail to see why she even needs it from me.

At the end of June I will be getting married. Everyone who would be attending the funeral was invited to the wedding.

She told me that she was going to pay me back but I already knew in my mind that she would pay me back in cash and that wasn't what I needed.

In the past 6 months, I have experienced a soul-crushing bout of anxiety and depression. It severely impacted my performance in school, and for the first time in my life, I failed a class. (I am usually a straight-A student.) So, on top of having all of these new emotions suddenly overtaking my life, getting into a good college, something I've never really worried about before, is the first thing on my mind 24/7.

My cousin, who is a long time cat lover, will take about a week or so to gain the little animal's trust and after that they just become bff. He will buy them food, give them water, let them sleep at his bed. Over time, little cat just naturally figures that's his house.

My parents are openly against it and will always kick them out whenever they see them. Few minutes later, they're back inside.

Personally, I really don't mind. I like them, play with them, but that's all. I never let them inside when I'm home alone. I don't feed them, I give no money to buy medicines or anything else. I think there's a natural agreement that they are his responsability.

So, last night it was about 1am and I had brought my gf home to sleep over. As soon as I get inside my bedroom, I notice the smell. Little puss have left us a big surprise.

I believe I haven't done anything terrible. I went to my cousin's bedroom, he wasn't deep into his sleep because he answered my first call imediatelly, and I politely let him know of the situation and asked him to get rid of the brown gift his child gave me. And so he did.

58460,73391,"WIBTA for making my friend pay for my broken laptop?. So I’m in a school program that relies heavily off of computer programming. In order for us to get ANY work done, we need a powerful laptop (nothing ridiculous, but you can’t really use your basic dell) 

Last year I saved a lot of money to replace my old laptop with a more powerful one. I game a lot and wanted something to take notes on 

The old one works just fine (it can even game still)- but it was 7 years old. I kept it in case something happened to my current one). I also have a shitty third one that was from Highschool (I barely ever sell electronics). I also am very particular with my stuff. I have NEVER cracked an electronic or anything -although I’d never notice a scratch on a shell or something 

My friend was freaking out that his laptop broke and it would take a few months to get the insurance and fix (~3 months in the end) 

This would mean he had no way to get school work done outside of the lab (which is horrible). We are good friends so I naturally I offered my laptop. When the shitty one wasn’t enough, I let him use my other one 

He kept asking like “oh but are you sure it ok?”  And I insisted because he’s my friend 

I said there’s nothing on the laptop I need -it just needs the charger and to be returned at one point because it’s my backup. I said he could use it for anything like gaming (he’s a hardcore gamer) stuff 


He brought it back after the three months and I put it aside thinking nothing of it 

Well, that was 2 months ago and now my other friend broke my laptop by accident (no drama and his insurance will cover it). So I pulled out my fully functioning laptop and he really fucked it 

He downloaded a LOT of software (like performance altering stuff for gaming) and it had viruses. Annoying but I can’t fix it and I did say that was fine. 

BUT the shell is cracked. I didn’t notice it because I never checked it when he handed it to me, but you can tell the shell is cracked like it was dropped on a corner. It is noticeable if you use it 

If he just told me, I wouldn’t have cared. But now i need to use it and it’s really budding me. 

It’s old and I’m only using it temporarily (and I didn’t notice for a while). But it’s my property and I do use it. WIBTA if I confronted him or should I just let it go ?. Am I the asshole?",NTA he should have owned up to it when he handed it back.,0,0,0,0,1

29851,37723,"AITA for walking ahead to de-board plane?. Pretty simple scenario.  My plane had just landed.  I was in an aisle seat maybe 12 rows back and only had a really small backpack.  The people up ahead were moving, giving maybe like 6-7 rows of free space in front of me, but the 2 rows in front of me had not really started getting up.  Nevertheless, since I was traveling light and ready to go, I started making my way towards the front.

&#x200B;

An older gentleman two rows in front of me who had not yet gotten up cut me off as I started making my way up.  Giving me crap about how I should wait my turn to get off just like everyone else and start leaving after the aisle in front of me leaves.

&#x200B;

However, since my things were all together and I was ready to go, I thought it would make more sense for me to move up and give people more room to get to their overhead luggage, rather than stand around just waiting for the people in front of me to get up.  I said something to this effect, like ""I've got my things and am just trying to get out of the way,"" but he was basically like, no you have to wait your turn like everybody else.

&#x200B;

I didn't want to start a conflict with this older guy on a quiet plane, so gave in and waited for his aisle to get up.  It's not like I was in a rush or had a connecting flight, so didn't think it was worth fighting over getting off an extra two minutes early.

Nevertheless the whole situation bugged me because this guy basically made me out to feel like an asshole.

Anyways a few weeks ago my gf wanted to see how it would look like if i grew it out, and asked me to let it grow out.

54096,67920,"WIBTA for restricting my daughter’s phone usage for, among other things, constantly talking to her dad?. No disclaimers, no apologies, let’s get right into it. 

I’m one of those parents who got their 10 year old a phone mainly for stuff like getting a hold of her after school in case pickup plans change and other emergencies. 

Her dad and I are separated and I am married to her stepdad which is all fine, it’s amicable. I have her weekdays and he has her every weekend. 

Predictably, my daughter uses her phone a lot, mainly for YouTube - she doesn’t have any kind of social media - and texting her one other friend who has a phone. Her usage has been a little over the top, I rarely see her without the thing in her hand but one of the reasons I am feeling like IWBTA for restricting her use is because she uses it to communicate with her dad. 

A lot. 

He texts her constantly and vice versa and calls her in the morning and at night and they’re on the phone for 30 mins to 2 hours on average. This is constantly interfering with stuff like trying to get her off to school on time, getting her to eat dinner, bed etc. I’ve talked to her dad about it and asked him only to call at certain times and to try not to keep her on the phone for too long for those reasons, but there are other reasons I am concerned. 

Despite our separation and the fact she spends the week with me and weekends with him, my daughter has always been more attached to her dad. Like, slept in bed with him til she was about 7, wouldn’t sleep on her own at his place unless he camped out on the floor, that kind of stuff. It got better between 8 years old and now, but then I got her the phone and while I have no problem her using it to keep in touch with him I’m concerned about the over-attachment again. 

I totally get that it’s normal for kids of separated parents to have separation anxiety and all kinds of fixation issues and what not but I’m concerned that getting the phone has made it worse again. So WIBTA for restricting her phone use, including telling her she can’t stay on the phone for hours with her dad? Or is this normal and am I overreacting?

&#x200B;

Yesterday, I had an 11AM appointment to get my teeth cleaned. Well, around 10AM or so, I received a phone call asking if I could come in at 11:30, as the hygeinist was running behind. No problem, I said. I work nearby. However, I did note that I needed to leave by 12PM to return to work. They said that shouldn't be a problem since I didn't need an exam, and  theywould give the hygeinist a heads up.

&#x200B;

Anyway, while I was on my way over, I recieved a call at 11:15. The same receptionist asked ""hi, NewPartner1234, you had an 11AM appointment today, are you going to be a little late?"" I told them I received a phone call asking me to come in at 11:30. She said she'd let them know I was running late but was on the way.

&#x200B;

Well, I get there, and they say hi, and the second receptionist asks ""do you still need to be out by 12:00?"" I said yes, and she glanced at the waiting hygeinist, giving her an annoyed look as if I were some entitled Karen. I let the hygeinist know that someone from the office (I knew it was the first receptionist) told me to come in later. She said it shouldn't be a long cleaning, so no problem. For that reason, my mother told me to just let it go when I spoke with her later that night.

&#x200B;

However, I received a follow up survey, asking how my experience went. It renewed my irritation to the point where I had the urge to speak with the dentist directly, as I assume the receptionists are the ones that read the surveys.

&#x200B;

The lying and feigned ignorance of receptionist #1 was the irritating part. I've worked in doctors offices before, so I understand mistakes sometimes happen, and I would have ZERO problem with it if she had just said ""yeah, my bad."" But the first receptionist called me to ask if I could come in later, then failed to let the hygeinist know she had done so, acting as if I was the one that was the problem.

29958,37863,"AITA by not changing my plans?. This happened last night and so I'm confused if I'm the TA.

Earlier in the week my (30) boyfriend (32) (together 6 months) told me that was going out with an old friend after work on Friday night because he was in town and they hadn't seen each other in a while and wanted to catch up on life. 

We usually hang out on Fridays and get dinner, so it's more of an assumed date night. So we really didn't have plans or anything exciting going on so of course hanging out with a friend is fine. 

Because he was going to be busy Friday night, I made my own plans to hang out with my girlfriends, which was go out to a bar, eat food and just hang out. Which I told him on Wednesday night. 

On Friday (yesterday) morning my boyfriend sent me a text and said that he decided he didn't want to hang out with his friend because he'd rather hang out with me so he canceled his plans. I told him that he should go because I had made plans. He refused and just kept saying that he'd rather spend the night with me. 

We ended up in this huge fight because although he wouldn't come out and say it, he was asking me to cancel my plans because he canceled his. I thought this was incredibly unfair and a bit controlling. He never approached me prior to canceling his plans, he just assumed that since he changed his plans that I should change mine. 

I did offer to come over afterwards but all he could say is he canceled his plans to spend the night with me not to just sleep with me (I would be leaving my friends pretty late). 

He has gone radio silent on me and we ended up not spending the night together. 

So reddit, am I TA here?. Am I the asshole?","NTA.  He should have at least given you a heads up instead of making this assumption and even if he did, it would be really rude to make plans with friends and then say “oops the boyfriend is available I’m gonna have to cancel this”

41790,52459,"AITA for explaining to a 16 year old how babies are made?. So basically I go to a private catholic school in the midwestern United States, so you could guess it to be a pretty conservative environment. I’m a senior and I walked up to one of my freshman friends to hear her talking to her sophomore friend about how she’s sexually active. Sophomore friend had a look of confusion on her face, so I became curious and approached the conversation. This is when the freshman said something about a condom and the sophomore said “Wait, what’s a condom?” This is when I sighed, because even for a catholic conservative school, most people know this much. So I explained what a condom was. Soon after she said,”Well I mean, I don’t even know how babies are made.”  This is when I asked her if she wanted to know and asked that I explain because her mother took her out of middle school to avoid sex education, and homeschooled her for 6th-8th grade. This is when I gave the scientific, biological explanation of “how babies are made”. 

Most of my friends don’t think I did anything wrong, but one friend and one of my siblings thinks I should have honored the family’s wishes. Knowing that the lack of sex education is proven to be a cause for teen pregnancy and STDs, and she was at the age when most people begin to have sex, I believed it be necessary to tell her everything I could. The explanation was educational and scientific, and not vulgar or suggestive in any way. So what do y’all think, AITA?

34838,43902,"AITA for being annoyed that my mum bought me clothes?. So I’ve got a job interview in the coming days and realised just recently that my dress pants have a rip near my knee. I tried them on to see if it was noticeable and it was, especially considering how much my skin stands out against the pants. So I need to go buy more, obviously, but I’m a big guy and buying clothes makes me feel super self conscious, which is definitely my own problem, but it’s for this reason that I hate receiving clothes as a gift because often times I’ll be given the wrong size and it makes me feel terrible to say they’re too small or don’t fit.

So earlier I was on the phone with my mother (we still live quite close to each other) and she offered to get me some as she was already at the store. I specifically asked her not to because I’d rather be there to try them on myself and make sure I get the right size. 

Lo and behold she’s done it anyway and got the wrong size, just like I expected would happen. When I told her this was why I specially asked her not to because I wanted to do it myself she got extremely frustrated and said that she was just doing something nice. (And I understand that, but like I said, receiving clothes that are too small just makes me feel like shit). 

Anyway I told her my problem wasn’t with her doing something nice it was that I’d specifically asked her not to do so after she offered (she didn’t say, “I’ll get you some pants” she said “Would you like me to get you some pants” so I thought I was right to refuse).

I thanked them profusely and insisted that we open it up and share it as a toast to celebrate. 

Most of them declined (they were driving) but one or two joined me and we each had about a glass and a half. The bottle was about halfway full and the two coworkers who gifted me the wine were heading to the airport with me. The wine was probably about a $25 bottle, so nice but not like crazy expensive.

My initial plan was to bring the bottle with me to the airport and then discretely throw it away before checking my bag so that I didn’t hurt the coworkers feelings.

The guy then went to the aisle and started shouting if the bread there was  'Sandaas Bread', came back to the till, and started talking to the cashier.

They even ask all of our security guards to follow them home despite the fact some of the guards live very far away and we work in a very open area where it would be supremely difficult to hide unknown vehicles.

I've met them a few times, and they're the typical ""player"" types who  base their self-worth on how many women they can bag.

20042,25512,"AITA for still being annoyed at not being allowed to sleep on the Sofa at brothers house?. So, some context, me and my mother have being traveling to my Brother and his partners house (around a 3 and a half hour trip by car if traffic isn't bad, we got the train last visit, quite expensive tickets my mother bought) to help out with housework (cooking, cleaning, etc) and looking after my 2 year old niece for the last 3 weekends as my Brothers Partner (my soon to be sister in law) is very ill with pregnacy sickness, she routinely goes to hospital to get drips but she's been given steroids so she's somewhat more stable but still very ill.

Brother recently also got into a car accident (Just Car damage, no injury), so was quite on edge, he's also got some issues surrounding possible redundancy at his work at the moment

We arrived on friday with the aim of going back on monday.

They have two extra beds, one was my mothers, the other was allocated to Brothers Partners Mother, who was coming on the saturday evening, the sleeping plan given to me was that I was too sleep on the floor next to my mothers bed (just wooden floors) in my sleeping bag and a few pillows.

I asked if I could sleep on the sofa instead of the floor, they (Bro and Bro's Partner) said no as they ""Had a thing"" about people sleeping on their sofa, Brother said I could sleep in Partners mothers bed if I washed all the bed clothes the next day, since I had a full day of looking after my Niece and brothers partner and already existing housework on my own (They've only lived their a few month so it's not 100% quite yet) I said no, I was tired, just wanted to sleep, so I took the floor.

Thankfully, Mother bought me a blow up bed the next day and a motorised pump, so the issue was dealt with the next night.

Am I just being a dickhead about being sore they didn't let me sleep on the sofa? The Floor fucked me up obviously.

Note, I am very close to both of them and love my Niece dearly, I'm fine going there and looking after things while their lives are quite chaotic and up in the air, I was just annoyed they didn't adapt their normal way of doing things (they are very very particular people, too a fault) to accomodate me while I was there.

51267,64315,"WIBTA If I shamed my MIL to not taking in a baby squirrel through her extended family?. My s/o's (\~1 year together) mother and I don't really like eachother. I feel she is verbally abusive to her son and takes advantage of his kind nature; she finds just about an excuse not to like me because she feels I'm ""taking away her son"". Talking to her isn't really a convincing option, since she doesn't listen to me or anyone for that matter.

Yesterday, s/o's cat caught a baby squirrel that had fallen from it's nest. The infant is about two weeks of age, probably just a few days older. The cat did not injure it, but it cannot live autonomously at this age. It's eyes are not open, it barely has fur, and it doesn't move much out of the fetal position unless being fed. S/O's mom decided she wants to raise and release it, believing if she takes it to FAW or any other rehab/rescue services they'll kill it. I formerly worked with FAW services at my local zoo, so I know for a fact they'll do everything the can to keep the infant safe and well cared for. In the unfortunate and unlikely case of euthanasia, I'd trust their judgement. These are professionals who handle cases like this for a living. She does not want to put the squirrel out again to let the true mother take it in.

S/O's mom is insistent on keeping it. I felt the only way I could possibly talk her out of it is to make it public. I'm friends with her entire extended family, but not her, on Facebook. I was going to post about us finding the squirrel and that we need help convincing s/o's mother to take it to a wildlife service. I thought the extended family would do more to convince her than I would. I just want what's best for the squirrel, and I don't believe that S/O's mother is capable of providing that.

TL;DR: S/O's mother wants to taken in a baby squirrel their cat caught and raise/release. I insist she takes it to a wildlife rescue or FAW services; she doesn't listen. WIBTA if I post about the squirrel on Facebook and urge her relatives to convince her to take the squirrel to a rescue?. Am I the asshole?",ESH.

Basically I have some pre-conceived notion about something, or maybe know nothing about a topic or subject. My SO tries to tell me something to the contrary or tell me something I didn’t know.

And usually rather then just accepting blindly, what anyone say as fact, I usually ask for more. Like how they know or how they found out, or why they think that. I like the full picture and details.

Example. My SO and I were talking about a podcast, new to me. She has already been through. She tells me about a cast member leaving on bad terms, and give me a brief idea of what happened. But seeing as I have no idea and apparently it was never hugely public, I expressed my confusion. And how I didn’t notice the conflict within the cast, because I skipped the first few episodes (at her behest).

I tell her I didn’t know that, or notice the conflict on set. So I was surprised. She elaborated a little, and I was shocked. 

I respond “I guess they must have their reasons, so I’ll take your word for it” she replies with “sure 😅” and links a Reddit thread about it. Full of some of the info she gave me. I’m surprised, had no clue, and express my shock.

We go back and forth about moments where the cast was at odds, and  that in retrospect I can see what she’s getting at. She sarcastically thanks me for seeing what she’s getting at. And I express that I’m not very observant.

And she says that it’s “me not believing her when she tells me something”. And then it was a bit down hill from there. But not the first time it’s happened.

A few weeks ago, my mom asked me if I was getting my baby baptized. I told her I wasn’t, because SO and his parents are of a different religion and are against said religion, as am I. There has been many reports of very bad things with said religion, there was even a report in our hometown, at the church she wants the baptism to be done at.

I get lectured for about half an hour by family friend about how baptizing my baby is very important, and how they’ve already talked to the priest about it. She then tells me if money is the reason we aren’t doing it, her and her husband will cover the expenses. I tell her money is not the reason, and that she and my mom are only thinking about their own beliefs. Once family friend leaves, I go off on my mom about how she tried to get family friend to convince me, and how they were already talking to the priest about it.

Me and my fiance Ryan will be getting married in July. Ourselves and our son Nick are so excited. However, there's one thing that I've said to Ryan that I haven't said to anyone else: I don't want my brother's girlfriend there. 

My brother Ross has been with his girlfriend Laura for over two years. She is an accountant and is successful as well as beautiful and comes from a very well off family.However, I have always found her to be a very unpleasant person and while I've never said this, I think Ross is better off without her. 

A few months ago we all went on a family trip just for a few days. Everyone paid their own contribution for tickets except Laura, who insisted that my mum pay for her. Bear in mind that my parents aren't particularly well off. In the end Ross paid for her out of his own pocket. 

She is also a complete snob. When her and I first met she checked out my wardrobe. I don't have expensive tastes, but she had the nerve to ask ''Don't you have any *nice* clothes?'' I had a go at her but ever since then she makes other snobby statements which I think she does to annoy me. She also kept nastily saying I shouldn't pick a wedding dress because I'd ''mess it up''. 

The final straw was last weekend, when at a family dinner she got absolutely wasted drunk and tried to dance on the dinner table in her heels. She ended up falling off and had to be taken to hospital, not seriously injured but said it was my fault for not stopping her climbing onto the table. 

Since then I've decided I don't want her at my wedding. She is a liability when drunk as the weekend showed, and she will try to make our special day about her. The problem is that mum sees her as a sort of surrogate daughter and I'm sure if I told her that I didn't want Laura there she would go insane, never mind what Ross would say.

I went on a two week trip for my work recently. During my trip, I left my teenage son at home; he is old enough to stay in our apartment by himself.

My girlfriend visited with her two children while I was gone, which I have no problem with. However, upon arriving home, I certainly began to have a problem when my son informed me that after being there for a little while, she received a call from a friend at her work, and chose to invite that friend and another friend over to my apartment. The work friend proceeded to bring her own two sons as well. My son was very uncomfortable and wanted to spend time with his own girlfriend, but was not able to because of how many, to him and to me, strangers were in the apartment. He did not have the nerve to speak up about it nor felt comfortable leaving them there, and I do not fault him for that.

I was very dissatisfied to learn that she had taken it upon herself to invite people I have never met into my home. We do not live together and I do not feel that it is appropriate for her to make that choice. She feels that I am significantly overreacting and told me that she wouldn't do it again, but also felt she should not apologize because she had no way of knowing that it would upset me so much.

I get quite good grades, she asked me about what I wanted to do and I said I want to start my own business at some point in my 20s after uni and she said that the business world is really tough and unlikely to succeed in, so I just politely said:

Sometimes it's just my mom and me. No biggie.

13753,17605,"AITA for not wanting to look for houses yet?. My Landlord's mother who owns our rental property that we rent month to month just passed away. My wife feels we(I) should start asking around for new rental properties to move into if they choose to sell the house and we need to move. She feels it is just a matter of time before the house gets sold and we should use this time now to look. It is not even on the market yet, but she is assuming that they will want to sell the house and will want to put it on the market before summer and only give us the required 30 days notice. 

I, on the other hand, think this is an overreaction. They have never mentioned anything about selling the house when she passes, and even hinted at the opposite when we brought it up before moving in. Also, we live in a small community, and asking around for properties might eventually get back to the landlord, who might find it insulting that we think he's gonna kick us out soon.

It's hard enough to look for a job and then a house after that, but to look for one now only to move again in 4 months?

2001,2481,"AITA for being bitter about my friend's plans?. Ok, so, we're both 20 and in college. Starting last May we moved in the together and it was basically established that we'd be roommates for the next 2 years (we'd just started our 3rd year in uni). We are also really good friends.


For some context, they (I'll call them M) started dating someone (call them A) around January of this year. As soon as that started, M & I's relationship pretty much sank in terms of time we spent together. I would literally never see them for weeks and they would hang out with their partner 24/7. Everything is now a We for M. and for the record, I don't like A at all. I think they are awful for M and is taking advantage of the fact that M is desperate for a good relationship with someone who isn't transphobic. 


So the situation is that M told me that they (M & A) are planning on moving to a different state (think Midwest to West Coast) this summer with A's best friend. Although the plan is dependent on if A will graduate this spring. I am annoyed by this because 1) we had agreed to these roommate plans before they started that relationship, and if I won't know if I have to move until my lease is up (next May) that's going to be shitty as fuck 2) we adopted cats together. they're supposed to be our collective responsibility (although tbh M barely spends any time with them because like I said they spend all their time with A. I'm the one who feeds them, makes sure they get playtime in, and cleans the litter boxes most of the time). and 3) I think moving halfway across the country with a partner you've been dating for barely a year in your twenties is a fucking AWFUL idea. 


We have a pretty direct relationship so I have told M point 1 and 2 straight up although not 3 - because i always tell them problems I have with A and I can tell they just get annoyed by it and don't really take it seriously. But I have just been feeling bitter about this whole thing along with A and also wondering if I'm the asshole because apparently M's relationship to A is more important to them. M said they still would want to be friends with me if this happens but honestly I think I might be too resentful. And I really do respect the seriousness of romantic relationships but...M & A are barely compatible roommates and all ""compromise"" in that direction is composed of M having to deal with something A does that M doesn't like.

10696,13679,"AITA for wanting the airplane window shade up when I specifically booked a window seat?. I get a bit claustrophobic on flights and always book a window seat when I travel. I usually only need to take short domestic flights for work and the window shade has never been an issue. A few months ago, I was on a long haul from Europe to the US. I had a window seat in business class. Seats were in a 1-2-1 arrangement so I had the window on one side of my chair and an aisle on the other.

The flight left around 2pm local time. They served the meal fairly quickly after take off.  I still had my tray in front of me and was gazing over it out the window when the flight attendant reached over me with a tray to shut the window shade. I asked what she was doing and she said the guy across the aisle wanted to sleep. I told her I booked the window seat for a reason and wanted it open. 

The guy all the way across the aisle has a sleep mask and it was the middle of the afternoon. I also had a cross-stitch with me to work on during the 12 hour flight and needed better light than just the overhead lamp. The FA made some snippy remark about us needing to compromise and ""allowed"" me to put it partially back up.

AITA for keeping the shade up? The guy never talked to me before getting the flight attendant. She never talked to me before slamming it shut. The other passenger could block light with his sleep mask, pillow, and blanket since we had lie flat seats in little compartments and I paid $5K for the window seat. Why should I be forced to ""compromise"" and sit in the dark during the middle of the day? I wouldn't have thought twice about it because I've always believed the person in the window seat controls the shade but when I got up a while later to get a bottle of water, I noticed my shade was the ONLY one open on the entire plane.

They gave me a break on the rent because they liked me and I had the small room.

I'll try and keep this as objective as possible and try to just keep it to the facts of what happened.

I'd been partnered up with this person a little over a year.  We had shifted into a house together.  She had a kid, I had three.

I had/have a shared care arrangement with my ex wife.  It's bit unorthodox but basically every other weekend and every Wednesday night the kids stay with me.  Ex wife, kids and I were all happy with this.  We'd been doing it for several years.
As well as this, for every day every other week I'd take the kids after work and give them dinner at my place, then return them home at around 7:30pm.  A bit of a strange schedule but it worked for us.  (She had her child on a regular week-about schedule.)

A point to note is the new house was further away from my ex than my previous house.  So the commute to take the kids home each night was a bit longer.

After a while my new partner voiced her frustration with the schedule, saying it was hard to organise things when the kids had to leave early each night.

It then came to a point where she asked me to change the schedule to a classic week-about arrangement.  She directed it solely at me so I guess I was supposed to say ""okay"" and then convince the kids and the ex that this was a good plan.

I was very much against it saying that the kids, ex and I were all quite happy with how things were and didn't really want to change it.  She wasn't very happy about that.

We were seeing a relationship counselor at the time (things weren't great between us), and I wont' say the counselor took her side but it felt like it.  He agreed that we should change the schedule.  I felt hurt that the counselor would jump to that decision so easily without weighing up that there were more people involved here than just my partner and I.

Anyway, she started making fun of my dog which kind of upset me since I don’t see what’s wrong with being adopted. My mindset is that love is love and you don’t need to have the same blood to be family. So I asked her what if she’s adopted? She said she’s not because she had baby pictures to which I responded that how can you be sure that that’s you as a baby?

38151,47960,"AITA for refusing to buy my(21M) GF(20F) cigarettes now?. 
So my GF and I have been together 2 years now. 

We both have smoked on and off our entire relationship. My habit was always worse than hers. It takes her about a week maybe two to smoke a pack where as I can go though a pack in two days. About a week ago I realized how awful it really makes me feel and I’ve decided to stop all together. I’m quitting cold turkey. 

My GF on the other hand has decided to keep smoking which is 100% her business. BUT we do live in a state where the smoking age has recently been changed to 21 and she is not grand fathered in. So for the past few months I’ve had to be the one to buy her cigarettes. She always pays for them and it wasn’t really a big deal since I already buy her alcohol and stuff. 

But now that I’ve stopped I don’t really feel all that comfortable buying them for her. It makes me feel like it would just be easier to buy them for myself as well and also I don’t want to be the one enabling her bad habit. 

Today she asked me if I could pick her up a pack when I stopped for gas and when I told her no she got pissed. She told me I wasn’t her father and that because I quit didn’t mean she needed to and a bunch of other things. I tried to explain but she is not seeing my side.

So I (26M) and my girlfriend (28F) have been living together for five years, and dating for seven. Everything is great between us, and up until recently, we both have had steady jobs making around 30-40K a year. We live pretty averagely in an apartment together, and have been extremely happy.

Recently, my company, a family owned business, which I have been with for nearly five years now and know the owners on a very personal level, promoted me to a senior position at a new property. My new salary is just above the 120K mark (an extremely significant raise that I never thought would happen). After relaying the news to my girlfriend, we went out and celebrated, getting dinner and drinks, and had a great night. Then, the next morning, she told me she would be putting in her two weeks soon. I was very confused, and asked why. She said that with my new position, she could stay at home and take care of other things, or pursue her hobby as an artist. I was taken aback, and told her she should still keep her job, as my raise should have no correlation with her keeping a job or not. She got defensive, and we haven't really spoken about it since.

41599,52215,"WIBTA if I marry my girfriend?.  

          First off some background, we went to high school together and ended up going to college together. We started hanging out together a lot during this past semester and have been dating for 3 months. We are both 18, and I’m still financially dependent on my parents and loans. 

          Now, we know what it sounds like, but our sole intention in marriage is financial. We plan on just going going down to the courthouse, paying that fee, and getting a judge to sign our marriage license. This would allow us to file as independents as a married couple, without the expected support from other family members. This allows us to receive grants and subsidized loans from FAFSA. Our cost of living would also be significantly decreased because we would qualify for double occupancy. But we wouldn’t start living together for another year down the road, but if we want to qualify for the 20/21 FAFSA we would need to be married before October 2019. 

          The primary hiccup in this plan, is our parents reaction to this proposition. Neither of us have told our parents this plan, but most of the pushback would likely come from my side of parents. I know my mom would hate this idea, because she is very sensitive on the topic. Our situation is very similar to my own parents when they went to college together. My parents met my mothers freshman year in 1995, and got married the following year. My mom absolutely hates this fact. It put a lot of stress on their marriage and they were divorced for a time. I’ve made jokes in the past about getting married very early, and my mom reacts very poorly. The nuance in our situation is that my girlfriend and I would not consider ourselves husband and wife. We both come from Christian backgrounds, and this process would not be a marriage through God from our perspective. 

          So, WIBTA to my mom if I marry my girlfriend and become financially independent from her?

          TL;DR- My girlfriend and I want to get married for the financial support from FAFSA. We both know my mom would hate it. WIBTA?.

I tried getting her back over the past 2 years but she wouldn't talk to me until 6 months back when we finally started chatting over the phone and eventually  it became an everyday thing leading to talking on long calls. She told me that she is not happy with the guy and doesn't feel the same for him as her guy didn't give her enough time. We eventually got close like old times , started talking about our future and where it's going to. I obviously hadn't gotten over her and would do anything to get her back. I stay in another country for my job so it wasn't easy to immediately go meet her and hurry things up. So we decide to meet this December when I planned to visit my country for vacations. I told my parents about her and that I want to marry her. Three days after that, she told me that we need to talk. She told me that she can't say no to her current boyfriend and things are sorted between them and that we shouldn't talk regularly now. I felt being used again . I eventually accepted the hard truth and requested her to still meet me so we could say goodbye to each other on good terms. But slowly, she started keeping distance , didn't text me herself , gave excuses that she's preparing for an exam and can't be on the phone all the time. By the starting of November, she stopped caring even if we didn't speak for a week. I stopped talking to her . She did message me one or twice, asking where am I lost. I would just answer her casually. I eventually dropped my plan to see her as well cuz I felt hurt by her ignorance . My mind was stuck on the thought that she used me again when she was going through a rough phase in her relationship. Few days back I couldn't resist but went ahead and sent our chats to her boyfriend and told him everything. He called me and asked me what happened between us and since when. He immediately broke up with her. My ex obviously called me and bad mouthed me for telling on her.

Anyway, one of them was a fairly good buddy of mine (we used to grab a beer every couple of months, not BFFs or anything) and he lived way out in the sticks - a 45 minute or hour-long drive away. I have a spare room so I said he could sleep there for the week if he wanted.

So the first two nights everything is fine, we worked until 3 or 4am then went home, went to sleep, all's well. The next night a girl he was vaguely seeing rocked up at the bar, they both got trashed and he wanted to bring her back to my place so they could hook up. I said no: didn't feel comfortable with it, and I know it sounds weird but I have a rescue cat who isn't too happy about having strangers around at the best of times, and I didn't want her getting too traumatised.

He didn't make too much of a fuss about it at that point but the next day was really pissed, said that they ended up sleeping in his car and that if I couldn't be cool about it he just wouldn't stay at my place at all. I said he was welcome to stay for the rest of the week but the deal didn't involve guests and definitely didn't include noisy drunk sex in my house.

Also, I’ve had a gastric sleeve over 1.5 years ago, so the amount of food I can or want to eat is way less than his. 

The other night I was eating a bowl of cereal for dinner because that’s all I wanted. He came home after a couple of Lyft drives, saw me eating and said he’s hungry. I said okay, well I’m just going to eat cereal. He then asked me if I can cook some food for him and I giggled and said no. And that made him mad. I laughed because I was surprised that he asked me since I told him I’m fine with just cereal and thought he was joking.

Her mother is a stay at home mum with no responsibility other than raising her child. Despite this I have never seen my niece without an iPad and a non stop stream of random YouTube videos. 

I never thought much of it until we noticed certain behaviours occurring. I think it's important to mention here that I have another niece and nephew (5 & 2) who have been very bright and very talkative from an early age who were both allowed very little screen time.

- Not being able to maintain eye contact or concentration when trying to interact
- Limited attention span
- No speech just noises
- Unparalleled excitement when watching a screen

I met this bartender about a month ago and we hit it off, I went back and he asked me out. I said yes and we hooked up on Date #1.

We weren't exclusive (he has known I'm going back to my country in late July and neither of us has an interest in a long-distance relationship), but de used pet names and I was going to his bar, and then to his house 4-5 times a week. Please note that he only ever texted me at like 10pm or later. Once or twice, after a night together,  we spent all day together.

Monday, this guy at the bar asked me out for yesterday and I said yes. He and the bartender seemed to know each other and get along, but I couldn't tell if they're friends. I'm at his bar consistentnly and haven't seen his friend. I go home with the bartender.

Yesterday, the guy and I go on a date. It wasn't good and I regret it. Hé was pushy and kissed me but I never went home with him and broke things off the morning after our date. 

Here's where I for sure fucked up (but it could have been earlier). The bartender texted me at 11pm-ish asking what I was doing and if I wanted to go out. I said I was packing for a trip. Technically at that point I was outside my house and was about to start packing.

I get inside (5 minutes had passed) and then get a barrage of texts calling me a liar, a dirty whore (something to that effect- I'm not fluent in his language), never talk to him again, etc. That he knows I was out with his friend.

Idk how he found out. If I'd known this'd be his reaction I never would have gone out with his friend. So after pleading for his forgiveness and trying to explain the situation (albeit not well), nothing has changed and I'm reasonably confident he will never speak to me again.

I for sure shouldn't have lied, I mean even if I'm afraid of drama and we weren't dating that's not the mature thing to do.

So I just told my sisters that they have to work on their own projects from now on cause I need to focus more on my work.

I replied, a little jacked: ""So after just 2 years,  they'll become good artists like that?"" I snapped my fingers lightly to demonstrate instantaneous-ity.
And she replied with a positive, I was starting to get confused at her and a bit angrier, but I kept the conversation from becoming a shouting contest.
I kept explaining that they have to start, even if it's trash, my projects were also trash when I first started. She replied with ""Don't compare your sisters with yourself, you just do it.""
I was laughing inside at this point, but the arguing eventually led to her having enough and she just said something like: ""Fine, fine fine, go to your bedroom and do whatever, I won't consider you as an existence in this family anymore."" And more ranting.

So my dad is a huge scumbag. He never loved my mom. He only married her so her could move out of his mom’s house. He even had the balls to admit it. He never loved her, he met someone else and snuck around behind my moms back. 8 years ago, he left my mom and went off with this other woman. The whole process of everything was not easy to watch, as I had now seen my dad’s scumbag-ness. He and his new family moved away, then they moved back, then they moved away again, then moved back again. My dad went bankrupt once, and he and my mom were on bad terms. I didn’t really want to know him at all. Then, he surprised me by showing up at my high school graduation. That freaked me out. How did he know when it was, where it was or what time it was? He isn’t in my life at all. 

Fast forward to today. His sister called my work, looking for me. How does he know where I work? I found a note in the desk telling me to call his sister, and that it was important. So I called her, and at first I didn’t know who it was, because it has been 13 years since I’d last seen or heard from her. So she told me he had a stroke, and gave me the details (where he is, how long he’d be there). 

This jerk is not a part of my life in any way, and he irritates me. I don’t wanna have to go deal with that, especially in front of his new family, who I have not met by the way.

My dad was one of three kids - his youngest sister died in October, then he died of a combination of his alcoholism and pneumonia in January. Prior to that he had been helping care for his middle sister during her fight with cancer during a brief interlude of sobriety. After he passed away, my wife and I stepped in to help care for her during what initially seemed to be her recovery, and then up through her swift decline and death a couple weeks ago.

When it became plain she was not going to recover she rewrote her will, which originally split everything 50/50 between her siblings (my dad & her sister) to leave half to me & my wife, and half divided evenly between the rest of her nieces and nephews (7 of them). She also made me executor. 

She never discussed it with us, but I assume the new division was because we were the ones who basically put our lives on hold to help her out for the last six months or so. The most any of the other nieces & nephews came to visit her between the time my dad died and her passing was one of my sisters who visited, IIRC, 4 times in total, for an hour or so.

I wouldn't worry so much about it, but my wife and I are likely to end up with around $250K, and I am the most successful of my siblings, having decided early on to focus on building up a professional career and basically doing everything the opposite of how my parents did things.

46532,58427,"AITA for feeling smug about a friend’s husband’s life-changing injury?. I (m37) stopped talking to one of my best mates nearly a decade ago. This guy studied with me, was part of my regular (read: daily) social group as I studied at uni, and was the kingpin of my social group, which comprised a core of about six other guys and gals. I thought the world of him. We all hung out, went to bars, studied in the library together, supported each other. We were solid mates.

After the usual uni flings (none with me - we bat for different teams), my friend met a guy that he fell in love with. We’ll call him Lan. Lan was a good looking guy, friendly, funny, witheringly sarcastic, and from an upper level of the already wealthy tier that my mate was already in.

Over time, I found that my friend was being encouraged by Lan to build on his, shall we say, more elite tendencies. Both of them began to look down on those they categorised as ‘below’ them and only strived to gain more status. As time went on, I was the first (but not the last) to be pushed from my long-standing group of friends for not meeting Lan’s - now shared - ideal. 

For those of you who have separated from a friend - you my bros, and you have my sympathy. For those not - moving away from a good friend is super tough, and in a lot of ways soooo much more difficult than a gf/bf split. When they take a whole group of mates with them, it’s devastating. I ranted a lot at my (now) wife. I could be randomly brought to tears by the situation for a year - but with time and separation from them all, got over it (maybe?), moved on, founded new, just as good mates, but still feel an ache for what could (should?) have been with that group as we grew older and less stupid or whatever. My mate and Lan got married and I was not invited, which is understandable. The gulf between us was too great by then.

Today I heard that  a few weeks ago, Lan fell off something at a bar and broke his back. The prognosis is that he could be paralysed from the waist down for the rest of his life.

Since becoming adults they are married to 2 beautiful SIL and both have new born babies. Im fond of them all but dont see them as much as i would like because of distance issues.

I have a beautiful fiance, we are living together and couldnt be happier. We also decided we wont be having kids, mostly because of personal beliefs and the fact that our family line is secured. This gives us a lot of time to be together, do nice and fun things and generally enjoy our freedom.

As a result of our mother passing away a few years ago, which hit me hard as i was the closest to her, i have been studying for a little over 7 years now.

17386,22130,"WIBTA if I didn't help pay old roommates for a sliding door I didn't break in a house I don't live in anymore?. I used to rent a room in a five bedroom house in California. The landlord is a bit under the table as he collects rent in cash and we don't have a formal lease situation. Before I moved out a month ago, the landlord started making these demands that we pay for repairs somewhat out of nowhere, for things that were broken before any of the roommates had even moved in. For example, he said we broke the sliding door on the side of the house and will need to pay him $120 so he can fix it. However, the sliding door had been broken for a long time, since before any of the roommates had moved in.

The way it works in that house is that when one roommate moves out, they find someone to take their place. The new roommate pays the old roommate the security deposit, so that the old roommate gets their deposit back. New people are always rotating in and out of that house because it's close to a university and most roommates are exchange students. So I'm not sure how it works with using peoples security deposits to pay for damages like this, since we don't directly pay the landlord and the landlord doesn't come by in-between people moving in to inspect the house for damages. I moved out before the sliding door thing was settled. I already got my security deposit back from the roommate that took my place and I've been out of the house for over a month, so it doesn't seem fair that my old roommates are now asking me to help them pay for the sliding door. But I suppose I was also still living there when the landlord first started asking for money for repairs.

I'm not sure to do about a situation like this, because other people have been telling me that it is illegal for the landlord to be demanding money for repairs like this, but it was also an under-the-table living situation. And the old roommates are probably afraid of being kicked out since there's no formal lease they've signed, so they're probably wanting to pay for the damages to avoid that conflict.

I of course help pay bills.But she isn't the best money management wise as she always is late on payments for things because she doesn't want to get a better paying job cause she doesn't want to stop being a hairdresser. I have had to take out loans on her behalf because we couldn't afford to move. I didn't have a problem with that at first cause she was paying for them and then she just stopped so i had to start paying for them so my bank wouldn't go into the negative.

41388,51951,"AITA for yelling at my mom over joking about my cat dying?. I had Tiger for close to 15 years. She was a beautiful calico, and I couldn't have asked for a better girl. My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. 

I'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.

Fast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) ""Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?""
Obviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. ""[My name],"" she said at least 3 times, ""[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?"" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, ""wow you're really mad at me?""

A day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my ""attitude"" and saying things like, ""I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke."" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.

I am pretty close to a chemistry teacher who is the head of the school quiz department because of my past record when it comes to quizzes. 

Due to this, he decided to personally enroll me in the school's 12th grade team as a dummy member to understand the material an year in advance. This was honestly an amazing opportunity for me and would give me a huge headstart, so I decided to accept the offer.

Of course, he conveniently did not tell me that it was an all girls batch, so it was basically 15 girls in a claustrophobic place with me as the only guy. Conveniently, these girls were really close friends...so no one really talked to me.

It felt awkward as hell for the first few weeks and then some until I finally decided to quit. They would get intimidated by me and whisper stuff pointing at me and giggle which annoyed the crap out of me. Whenever we had to solve problem sets till dinner they would go off to some fast food chain to discuss the problems and I would be alone for 3 hours, so I could not excel in the tests either because they would solve it in groups and it kinda bogged my moral now.

Around Thanksgiving, my bed was unmade and my RA asked me to make it before leaving. I was weirded out by this request as no RA had ever cared. So long as the floors are clean, we’re good. But I did it. 

When I left for Christmas break, I was in a hurry and got my stuff done early (bed included). The top of my dresser and desk do have a lot of stuff (papers, folders, pictures, etc.) but I didn’t think that mattered. My RA asked if I could tidy up my desk. I asked why it mattered, she said the hall director was a stickler for that stuff. I said I would, knowing it wasn’t her fault and left. However, I did email my hall director asking why the state of my bed and desk mattered to him, as it wasn’t in my contract. He said they’re allowed to want things a certain way, I replied it’s not harming the furniture and that as long as it’s cleared out by semester’s end, it shouldn’t matter.

It was lunch in the courtyard usually, and she would often call me names and other things like that. Usually, I just ignore it, but this day i was in a worse-than-usual mood.

Bich doesn't respond well to this, and begins crying and running over to her friends. I notice and walk over to say sorry, but Bich tells me to fuck off. I do feel sort of bad about it, and now all her friends and the school's whiteknight legion look at me in disgust. Do I deserve this reddit?

A few days ago, I was returning from walking my dog. I usually do a final loop around the front of my house before I head home, so in the loop I saw a car park on the side. I didn't think anything of it and continued down the shared driveway that heads to my house when I hear someone speaking. I have one headphone in so I pluck it out and turn around when I see an older woman.

To give some background, I live in Northern California and although the area where I live is known for its beautiful locations, robberies and break in have gotten much worse within the last couple years and we've had a couple of major items stolen from our vehicle and windows shattered. My trust level in giving information out is pretty low and I'm not feeling the safest as it is. 

So, the woman comes super close to me and says ""hello, how are you??"" I back away a little because my dog can be too friendly at times and tries to give hugs and say ""hello, good thank you and yourself?"" She then asks if I live around there. The way I am standng, I am inbetween two houses so either one could be my home or I could have simply be using the gate at the end to leave. I say ""yes I live around here"" and leave it at that. But she insists, ""what house do you live in""? 

At this point, I'm kinda nervous because I'm not very confrontational so I tell her ""oh, sorry I'm just not used to telling strangers where I live"" and laughed to try to make a joke out of it. She goes off and says ""This is my fault, I forgot I was in so and so county, I'm from New York where you can say Hi to people!! I'm just a neighbor trying to say hi!! I'm an educated person!!""

I said ""oh, so are you insinuating I'm not an educated person because I won't tell you where I live?

Over time I started to want to go out and do more social things (like concerts, festivals/fairs,  going out for dinner, movies etc) but he was totally uninterested.

 I have spent years continuing to do outdoor activity and hanging around the house with him and I go to the movies, out to restaurants, to concerts/fairs/festivals, to the beach etc with family and friends instead. It seems to work for us but sometimes I do wish he was there to experience things with me.

I kind of just shut down and couldn’t respond to their messages anymore. I was incredibly depressed, and after seeking therapy and analyzing my childhood trauma, it felt like Pandora’s box opened up. 

I didn’t mean to stop talking to my friends. The messages would keep coming, but I couldn’t find it in me to respond. I wanted to, very badly, but I couldn’t.

I waited for hours and realized she couldnt go because she had practice for a dance competition and a shooting for a movie project.

My wife is livid. Although she does agree that Sue should’ve been responsible, she says that I still should’ve made her a lunch. My wife and I have disagreed for years on the whole making lunch for Sue thing. Sue needs to be a 14 year old and make her own lunch; she should be able to find foods that fit in with her tastes. My wife, on the other hand, thinks that by asking her lunch, she can prevent Sue from going down a path of even worse eating habits and making sure that she gets all of her nutrients. I think my sister in law’s death from bulimia also plays a role in my wife’s attitude towards Sue’s eating. For the record, even at her worse, Sue has never been diagnosed with an eating disorder.

I agree with your wife.

56980,71568,"AITA for refusing to go to my husband's family functions because he never goes to mine?. My husband (24M) never goes with me (24F) to see my family. This year, he went to my family reunion but only because my uncle was dying and only had a projected month to live. He also plans on going to my family's house on Christmas  for about an hour. Then we normally go to his grandmother's house to see his family...for like six hours.

I don't quite find it fair that he only comes with me for an hour but expects me to sit with his family for around six hours. 

Last night, I wanted him to come with my family and I to a Christmas event. I'd told him previously about it and asked if he was coming. He said yes, then changes his mind last minute. He makes it excuses after. First excuse was ""I have to change my car oil."" Then it was ""I have a headache."" Then it was ""I have to open at work tomorrow."" Finally he just says ""I dont fucking feel like it."" He could have just said that originally instead of agreeing to go in the first place and changing his mind.

Some insight too -- we were supposed to spend time with his family before this Christmas thing. But his sister canceled last minute. And I had taken the day off work specifically for his event. His sister ALWAYS does this....makes plans and then cancels last minute. 

I told him that I'm not going to go to his family events anymore. He says that it's not fair to him because we only go see his family for the gifts. I told him that he doesn't understand family and that if he only sees his family for free shit instead of actually liking them and spending time with them, then that's a shitty thing to do.

I have known my friend for almost six years. He was my best friend for a really long time, and we knew virtually everything we could about each other. From the very start I had been very anti-drug and anti-alcohol and all that, especially since we are underage. The fourth year of knowing him, I had moved to a different country for a year. We occasionally chatted online, but neither of us were ever too much into texting. After coming back, I had noticed he treated me a lot different, and became really good friends with a complete asshole. I'm not just saying that because he changed my friend, just because his go-to joke was to beat you up. The thing that surprised me was that my friend actually seemed to find it funny. Over the course of the next 2 years, he kept becoming better friends with the asshole's friends, who were coincidentally bigger assholes. I wasn't left out or anything, mind you, I tried my best to just ignore the asshole and keep my friendship all ok. Fast forward to a month ago. Whilst walking out of school I try to catch up to him to tell him something (we walk seperate directions) only to see one of asshole's friends vaping. I ironically say ""That's very naughty"" to which my friend takes out a vape and ""rips a huge cloud"". My heart sorta dropped that second, seeing as we had loads of fun times calling people stupid for vaping and stuff back in the day. I held back tears walking home, however stupid that sounds. I stopped talking to him after that. Just completely cut him out.

My parents have been extremely frustrating to me as of late. I’m 16 (don’t start with the stereotypes pls), and my allowed time on devices (phone, PC, etc) is getting smaller and smaller by the week while I do nothing wrong or anything.

Parents’ arguments: “You slack your responsibilities because of video games!” I’m a homeschooled dual credit student, ~50 credits, 4.0 GPA. “Video games kill creativity!” Recently started teaching myself piano for Undertale and Kingdom Hearts songs. “You have no motivation to do anything else because you’re addicted!” I’ve been researching how to split the crankcase on a dirt bike so I can replace the connecting rod bearing and sell it, and willingly went a 3 days without my phone to prove that I’m not addicted, with my mom begging me to take my phone back during the third day (she was also checking my texts to see if my friends were worried through the entire thing). “You’re not active, your muscles atrophy sitting at your computer!” My BMI is lower than BMI tables (16.2), training for soccer almost every day, I practice with the local homeschool basketball team every Monday, and I got told this just after we got back from wakeboarding for 4 and a half hours, which we do weekly.

The routine that I was pretty okay with was 1 and a half hours a day on my computer, with a screen time limit of 2 hours on my phone. I couldn’t do some stuff, but I was fine.

Then, I asked if that could be increased to 2 hours on my computer and 2 hours on my phone, I can’t really do all the stuff I want to do on my pc in 1 and a half, which was met with a flat “no”, even after offering to take half an hour off my phone limit for it.

The next day, out of the blue, 1 1/2 on the computer every day is “unhealthy” and “excessive”, so it got taken down to 1 a day (technically, 7 a week, but I used it as 1 a day). This lasted ~2 weeks, then I finished my summer dual cr

I’ve done nothing wrong, haven’t gotten into trouble, my grades have only gotten higher, I’m more active than ever, and even more responsible. So again, AITA?

My opinion is that if an outsider looks at this, it’s not, in my parents’ words, “moderation” (in my experience moderators are childish and can’t wait to mess with you, but that’s just me. Not gonna say that to them though lol), and it’s instead punishment.

Posted here instead of r/parenting for specific reasons, but can’t say because of the character limit.. Am I the asshole?","NTA

Your parents sound like they want an excuse to control you. You are active physically and mentally, you don’t use all of your screen time on internet time wasters (reddit is a time waster but you can’t be perfect), and your parents can’t give a logical reason why your screen time is being reduced. 

Maybe remind your parents that once you move away you’ll have to self-regulate your screen time, you can either practice with them at home or figure it out on the go. You sound like you’ll be able to adjust easily, but this excuse might be good enough to at least earn yourself a little more screen time at some point.",0,0,0,0,1

Now the thing about Alina is she never really had any friends even at her wedding she didn't have any friends. Just her family.

Now I don't know if she has a fat fetish or something but there was a couple months where behind everyone's back occasionally Derek was sleeping with Alina.  The messed up part is he said she insisted he ""fill her up"" every time.   Derek admitted all this while absolutely hammered. He said it's why Alina has no friends, because she often slept around with people's SO'S and her bfs friends.

I’m so increasingly thankful for them all but they’re starting to get on my nerves.

Since I’m studying to be a nurse, I can understand and break down medical jargon to my family in a way that they can understand.

I explain, and then he goes on and asks, “So, should I get stem cells injected into my knees for my bone on bone arthritis?” I try to tell him that I’m not a medical professional, I can’t really prescribe or advise on medical decisions.

Some of my friends where planning on coming over yesterday for a “girls night”. I told them my bf was here and if they wanted to reschedule or if everything was cool. They said it was fine. 

Anyway, they come over. We watch some bad movies. Consume copious amounts of wine and weed. My bf is being extremely accommodating. He basically is giving us space and refilling wine for us. No complaints there. 

Anyway. One of my friends goes and pees. Sees that we have a hot tub. And proclaims that “we all should go for a swim”. I agree along with the other friend. I offer bathing suits to my other friends and they say “they’ll be fine”. I go and get my bathing suit on. When I get out there they are both butt ass naked in the hot tub.

But then out comes my lovely bf with a bottle of wine. He fills up their cups, sets the bottle behind the two girls, and and one (the one who wanted to get in) says that he should join us. I say maybe that’s not a great idea he doesn’t have his swimsuit. And she replies that’s okay he can just get in his boxers as “he probably won’t be wearing those tonight after we goto bed”. So my bf looks at me. Kinda Shrugs. Strips to his boxers. Then jumps in, sitting next to me across from them. 

My two friends at this point are rather drunk. Chatting about whatever. I look over and my bf is just staring at their chests. I give him a nudge. He looks at me like what? And looks up at the stars for a minute then back at their chests. My friends neither notice or care. 

I’m getting kinda annoying at this point but I can’t say anything to him in front of my friends. I keep nudging him to look away but he keeps going back to looking. I “accidentally” spill my wine and suggest he goes to get some more. At which point my friend says we still have some and bends over to get the bottle behind her.

One of those videos that starts off normal enough and then, WHAM!, two old guys having at it with some good old fashion up close, cock up the bum action. Not exactly safe for work, shocking and for the most part, not exactly what you want to watch on your average day. Cheap chuckle. Flash my colleague on the other side of the office the stink eye and without thinking I forward the video to my friend WhatsApp group with the same misleading headline. 

Well! That was a mistake and all hell broke loose. Very long story short. Accusations of being anti-gay, denigrating homosexuals, lacking any kind empathy, being “psycho” and an immature dickhead (definitely immature). This got to the point where one friend threatened to never see me again. I definitely fanned the flames at first, trolled my friends and played devil’s advocate but realized quickly they were serious and perhaps some of the tongue in cheek comments were lost in text. I leveled with them and things sorta cooled off but with the demand to never make any such “joke” ever again.

Despite all that, I’ll grant that it’s low brow humor, immature and ultimately disrespectful to someone who is LGBTQ. 

But at the same token, there was no intent to disrespect, it’s a dark humor riff (but barely), there should be no sacred cows in “comedy” (though you should know your audience - my bad), and the reaction was way out of proportion to the minor slight.  For context, it’s four straight guys - all fairly liberal and got no problems LGBTQ (including myself).

Are my friends overly sensitive or AITA?

Problem is, it seems luck isn't on my side: we don't have the same lunch, we don't have any of the same classes, and the extracurricular activities she's in are stuff I can't join, being a guy (lacrosse team, cheerleading). 

So I turned to my last resort, my friend Lindsey. So, Lindsey and I have been friends since 8th grade, and she's also on the lacrosse team with and is friends with Gwen. So she seems like the perfect person to ask to set something up between me and Gwen, right?

Problem is, she has a crush on me. She doesn't know that I know, but her friends have told me. I don't really feel the same way and just say he as a friend, so I pretend I don't know so things don't getawkward. 

And I didn't really want to ask her, and looked for all other options, cause I feel like it's kinda a jerk move to ask a girl who has a crush on you to set you up with her friend. But I really want to find some way to hang out with Gwen, and I don't have any other options.

And sometimes I just want to treat my friends to chocolate or coffee because I’m happy and that’s something we all do.) but I have one friend who never pays his fair share when we’re splitting bills or getting groceries.

If we go out to eat as a trio and for example, the restaurant can only split the bill into two checks. My friend would leave the other two to pay, but not mention paying us back. And if we are paying in cash, he would not offer to chip in and only consider helping with the tip after we all paid.

And when we eat out, it’s usually him that invites us out. (Most of us are back home for college right now and that friend hasn’t made any friends at the local state school. At this point we don’t have much in common over and I feel like I’m talking to a high schooler when we hang out and not someone in college.) Usually the rest of us in the friend group if we invite the group out, we would pay for a portion of our guests food for coming out to see us. (Like some dessert or a coffee etc)

I didn't join in, but I didn't say anything in response because I was stuck with them for the rest of the night and didn't want to cause problems.

So, this happened years ago. I was leaving work and saw these two girls (I always refer to them as hitchhikers) sitting outside in the cold and I offered them a ride home. On the ride we ended up all chatting and we all kinda got along so we ended up getting food and hanging out a handful of times over the course of a couple weeks. Neither of them had vehicles so I always did the driving. Well one day we went to dinner and I don't remember how it came up, but shortly after we ordered my bestfriend was brought up and the hitchhikers just started talking really bad about her and saying some pretty rude stuff. I didn't join in or say she was my best friend. I didn't want to say anything about it because we still had food on the way and I was there ride home. I was stuck with them so I didn't want it to be awkward. I just waited for the subject to change and got on with the night. 
After dinner I asked my bestfriend if she knew the hitchhikers and mentioned it to her.
She asked what I did and I said nothing and explained. She got really offended that I didn't defend her at all and felt 100% betrayed. That was the end of our friendship. I kept asking her if we could talk about it but she just kept saying there was nothing to talk about.

I would have went with ESH since your friend chose to end your relationship, however you seemed to continue a friendship with the girls who were badmouthing her, so there's a loss of trust.

The situation has been resolved, and we’ve changed the lock on our door.


Fast-forward to the past couple of weeks. I feel there’s no longer any need for the security cameras, so I’ve put “mine” aside, unplugged. However, R1 insists on leaving “his” camera plugged in at all times. My other roommate (R2) and I do not consent to being recorded.

Our counterpoint is that he does not have the right to record us without our consent, to which he says “the camera doesn’t record.” It’s a security camera, its purpose for being is to record.

When my family evacuated due to fire a couple years ago, I brought it with me. I was hoping to gift the set to my children one day.

My little sister and I have a bit of an age gap. She's in middle school (6th-8th grade in the US) and has had trouble reading.

The spine broken completely. It quite honestly looks ugly. After keeping it (relatively) clean and proper for 10 years, and to see one of my favorite books in such disarray... I just started yelling. I didn't wait for an explanation. I just froze and started screaming questions at my sister.

She looked terrified - Of me yelling, or the fact that she was caught, I don't know. She said I'd given the book to her like that. I noted that the book had signs of someone trying to fix it; There was tape in awkward positions. She'd apparently told my parents I'd given her the book like that, which I knew not to be true.

For a little background the area I live in is probably about 50% poor and 50% OK. This particular shops staff have always struck me as being unhappy to be there. They've given me this impression by arguing with each other at the tills in front of customers, yelling for each other across the shop (it's maybe school swimming pool sized) and getting terse yells back, swearing barely under their breath etc. The manager is in her 20s I think and she will regularly berate her staff in public.

I told her that when talking about tattoos, size, price, detail, and time all take effect and that's why the photo was sent.


She said ""now you know what she looks like without clothes"". (The picture was taken in a tattoo parlor and only skin showing was hip and upper thigh, everything else was covered)


I told her it's no different than a bikini and I wouldn't be upset if a guy she new sent a picture of a tattoo on his chest/stomach wherever if she wanted one but she doesn't have any tattoos.  She told me that's different because it's a guy. That's when I told her that she is getting over jealous about something that isn't worth being jealous.

12152,15556,"AITA for being nervous to dance with my girlfriend?. I will try and be as impartial as possible, as I am aware of how biases can come across. I want honest opinions, not just people taking my side because I'm the one telling the story.

This just happened. My girlfriend (20f) and I (22m) of 11 months, going on 1 year, were at a formal (aka, prom for americans). Everything was fine, she was looking amazing, I was proud to be her date, we both seemed to be having a good time. This was her formal, so all the people we were with were her friends primarily: I'm not uncomfortable with them, but I wouldn't call them close. They're good people.

After the formal, there was an afterparty at a local nightclub. We go, and we don't really dance apart from being in our seats, especially since she was in high heels. She had said to me that she was tired, and wanted to leave. I hadn't really got up and danced with her, since she was in heels, and she had said about being tired. Any time I tried to dance while sitting with her, she would mock my style, and laugh at me. I'm not a good dancer, but I'm also not terrible - I'm no worse than any other amateur. Her poking fun at me everytime I try with her certainly doesn't help with my confidence, and being comfortable around her. One of her friends (a guy) had asked me to get him a drink, since he didn't have card, and I obliged. This upset her, saying that I ignored her telling me to say no, saying I didn't listen to her saying she wanted to leave. The friend had said that she needs a drink, to loosen up and go dance with the rest of her friends. Instead she sat in the corner with me, and knowing that I had upset her I just felt bad and didn't talk much. I had thought she didn't want to dance.

After she gets upset with me, she says I caused the arguement, and she says I ruin everything for her. She says a series of really hurtful things to me, like saying this is why she never invites me out with her, how I'm the most boring person she knows, and how she knows people who have OD'd over 40 times that have more passion for life than I do. This is all especially confusing because she was giving her numerous signals she didn't want to dance.

Am I the asshole? Did I really ruin her night by being too nervous to dance? Did I ruin her night by getting her friend a drink when she said not to?. Am I the asshole?","NTA

Jesus Christ man, no.
You're not the asshole, and I'm not saying it because you're telling the story.

I think she should have been a lot more considerate of how you'd feel when she says those things. I am almost certain she would react quite badly if the roles were switched.

I just don't see a reason to act the way she did bro.
Whether she was upset previously to this 'event' or not, that is no way to treat your partner.

Mixed signals and broken communication can easily ruin a relationship. As with most men, I'm sure there were some ""signals"" she was giving that you didn't even know were meant to be signals. People, especially females, do it all the time.
Not being straightforward is probably the biggest reason people in relationships have a communication breakdown.

It's a popular venue and the only day they had available in the month we wanted was a Thursday. It's also A TON cheaper to book the venue on a weekday than it is on a Friday or Saturday.

Most of my family live out of town and will have to travel for the wedding. My parents are helping contribute to part of the costs and my mom is pretty insistent we either have it on a Friday or Saturday. It's literally twice the price to book the venue for a Saturday and we'd have to change the wedding date to be 3 months later, maybe into the next year.

5366,6876,"WIBTA For Calling Out My Spoiled Rich Friend?. So one of my closest friends of almost 5 years recently called me freaking out because her card kept getting declined. Her parents give her money every couple of months to help her cover  odds and ends (food,books etc). We’re both 18 year old full time uni students and live at home. Her parents pay for her entire tuition as well. Anyway, turns out she spent her entire $1300 allowance in less than one month on just food and clothes, which really rubbed me the wrong way. This is quite a big deal too because her parents aren’t insanely rich, about middle class same as mine. 

She hasn’t worked a day in her life and constantly complains about how her parents don’t let her have any independence, yet she is not only happy to take their money but spend it excessively. It’s just frustrating because I have friends who work full time and still can’t afford to go to university. 

But I feel conflicted because it is TECHNICALLY her money and she can spend it how she wants. But in general her belligerence towards money matters and not understanding how lucky she is to not have to stress about money whatsoever is frustrating to me and a couple of other friends.

If I don't get into the car at 7:10, I will get dropped off in a shopping center close to my school instead of the road next to it, so my brother will still be on time.

Good on you for calling them out on their homophobia and not allowing them to pressure you into making any decisions or being in relationships you may not be ready for.

We started a new world later that night, however, I got really pissed of at one of my friends and logged off, not wanting to stay as that would be uncomfortable and would probably lead to me being more mad. Nobody went on discord for the next few days, and I assumed nobody was logging on. A few days later, one of my friends tells me to get on and they had pretty much done everything without me, including making a base like 5k away from spawn. I wanted to restart, for the same reason that they did now, as it really isn't fun now seeing in their position. I asked 2/3 friends eventually if they would restart for me and they agreed, and we played another game as we waited for the other friend to log on so we could start.

The next day, all of them are saying that if I restart the world, they refuse to play with me at all. I think this is hardly fair as I had done the same for them twice before. I asked them why they wouldn't play as, again, I had restarted for them. They got angry, saying it was my fault for getting mad at one of them and logging off, and that they would just make their own server without me.

So, reddit, am I the asshole for wanting to restart?. Am I the asshole?","NTA but you guys are all really weird over this.

34685,43733,"WIBTA if I asked my cousin to come to my wedding without her children?. I am on mobile and English is not my first language so sorry about that.

I (24F) recently got engaged and am planning my wedding for September 2020. My fiancé and I had dinner yesterday with our parents to start thinking about who we are going to invite.

For context, I have 7 cousins on my mother side. They are all around 30 years old and as I am the youngest, I have always been left out. When we were younger, I always understood that they wouldn’t want to hang out with a kid but even now that we’re older they often have “cousins dinner” and they still never invite me. So this is just to say that I am not close to them but they’re still family so they are obviously going to get an invite. Most of them have children and we are going to invite the children as well.

However one of my cousins has two of the worst kids (I think they are 2 and 5) I have ever met. Basically they are never calm. All they do is scream, run and cry. The rare times when I see them is during family dinner and they give me headaches. Whatever they do their parents never say anything to them and let them do whatever they want. For example last time we had dinner with them at my mom’s house they jumped on the sofa, opened the fridge etc and their parents let them do as they want. When my mom kindly asked them to stop they just started screaming and crying. My other cousins’ kids never do this kind of things, they are all really calm and well behaved.

So when I mentioned that I didn’t want them at my wedding, my mom said that she understands why but I can’t not invite just them. I said that I would offer to pay for someone to watch them for the day and night of the wedding and even the next day if my cousin wants to stay for the brunch we are planning but my mom insists that I can’t ask my cousin to not bring them with her because when she will realise that the other kids were invited she could get angry and it could cause drama. And obviously I don’t want any drama to happen during my wedding.

My fiancé said that it’s my choice to make and whatever I decide he will agree with me.

So I think I could use some third-party opinion. Reddit, WIBTA if I asked my cousin to come to my wedding without her children?. Am I the asshole?",Easier to just state ‘no children’ across the board. That’s not a particularly unusual thing to do.,1,1,0,0,0

I'm a recent college grad who wanted to find a job in the field of psychology. To that aim, I had gotten hired as a behavioral technician. Before I was hired, during the interview, my now employer asked me to really research the position and think on it before accepting. So I did just that. After looking into it, I was aware of the situations BT's and RBT's would have to deal with and what was expected of them in the field. I didn't have a problem with that. So I accepted the position. However there were a couple of issues that had me dreading going to work after day one. First of all, all of my clients live at least an hour away from me. I nearly balked at all of the driving I was expected to do. Granted my employer pays for mileage, but that's only from my first client's house, to my next clients house. And they all live within the same vicinity. Now, I didn't expect to be paid for mileage in the first place. However I didn't expect for them all to be so far away. The job listing stated a place of business that was only 20 minutes away from where I live. I later found out that that's just where my employer lives. Second, and most significantly, I think through being in the field, I just found out that I don't like working with kids. That's not to say I hate children.

I work for a somewhat well known company as an ASM. Back in 2017 before I was promoted to my current position I was at just an associate another of our stores in town and the sales lead position became available at my current location. I applied and got hired for the position while being told the current sales lead didn’t want the responsibility. While there he would constantly leave me in the store alone to go to “recruiting events” or refuse to handle basic customer tasks in store. I even had to train his new ASM myself as he kept telling her to figure it out when she asked for help. For example I asked him to ring up my father for a neck pillow as I am not supposed to ring family and the other associates were busy and he refused right there in front of him, just “no.” So I tried to have a conversation with him and the ASM to go over how everything had been and to ask him to follow through on his basic contract as a manager and the next day I’m told I’m being demoted because the old sales lead was still coded as such so she could keep her pay even though I was running circles around her in sales. I moved back to my old store. 

Cue last August a new ASM is in after he’s run off the old one and several associates, the new ASM is training himself since the manager won’t do it and he finds some suspicious returns. Turns out this manager had stolen buttloads of expensive items (appliances, exercise equipment, etc), processing refunds on customer product that hadn’t been received to 4 separate cards of his and then punching in and out an associate who was out on workman’s comp while changing this poor guys Direct deposit info into his side chicks account.

Beyond chapel speakers explaining the immorality or same-sex marriage, there was no mention of queerfolk at any time. I wanted to change that, so I went through official channels to establish a chapter of the [Gender Sexuality Alliance](https://gsanetwork.org/).

The logic went that if I overcame the school's strongarming and officialized the club, it would be a tacit message from the administration that homosexuality was okay and the Bible was incorrect, at which point this prestigious private school would be no different than public (barring the tuition).

I’m (30F) getting married to my fiancé (30M) in the fall. We’re both very independent people and are paying for this wedding on our own. I already have my dress, and we have the venue, colors, and other major details planned out. 

My mother passed away a few years ago. My dad recently got remarried and my new stepmom has personally reached out to me to offer her help and will be helping with certain tasks. My other family members have also volunteered to do things.

We are not close to my fiancé’s side of the family. We rarely talk to his mother and don’t spend much time with her because she’s a very difficult person to be around.

My fiancé saw his mom earlier this week and she had a full on crying fit about the wedding. She’s hurt because she thought she would be going dress shopping with me and would do mother of the bride (MOB) stuff because my mom isn't around. She is threatening to not go because she feels so left out. 

She hasn’t reached out to me to ask me any questions about planning at all. We also don’t talk. Also, traditionally, mothers of the groom (MOG) don’t do much. I don’t know why she expected to take on a central role in wedding planning when she isn’t a big part of either of our lives and she has made no effort to contact me.

She’s saying I should be the one the reach out to her and make her feel welcomed. I disagree. I don’t think the couple getting married should need to reach out to people, and that people that want to help should (and have) made that known. She also seems fixed on MOB tasks and doesn't seem interested in doing MOG stuff.

We’ve also decided that we can’t trust her any important tasks if she’s already threatening to not come. But I still feel bad that she’s apparently gutted over this.

The reason I need a bus to school is that they decided to live in a different town to where I already went to school, this was out of my hands and they said that they would pay for me to get to school and back when we moved.

Additionally, he sleeps every day till 6pm to make up for the lost sleep. 

Here's the thing. The very few hours he is in the kitchen, he always eats at least a pack of chocolate alone. 

I told him that maybe his sleep schedule is fucked because of the massive sugar intake he has. (He literally goes to the store every single day to get 3 packets of chocolate that last him maybe 2 days)

His response? ""No it's not.""
I told him that it does happen to people and he should really stop eating so much sugar and maybe he can sleep.
His response? ""I don't care""

So the last straw was this morning when i also had a very shitty night and decided to skip the first course. He comes out and complains (as usual) about how bad he slept and that it's ""becoming an issue"".

Now here's where I think personally I went too far. I have many exotic pets, and I never asked him to take care of them before. I understand they are difficult to care for and what not. But specifically he loves the pet rats we have. And he wanted me to get them. I was working a 6 day week (65 hours ugh) and I asked him to clean the rat cage. It's a double critter nation so it's HUGE. But the rats are litterbox trained and we use fleece so cleaning consists of pulling it all out wiping off the shelfs and rebuilding the cage. I will admit this isn't a small task. But I came home to my girls in a bare cage litter boxes changed dirty bedding in the box. I asked if he was washing the other stuff, and he said no he shouldn't have to do this all for me and that they were my pets. I was so angry, I had just gotten home in the middle of my work week. And my girls where huddled in the corner in a naked cage. The pets he enjoys playing with, his friends and little brothers play with. I saw red and told him to leave for the night because I couldn't believe how lazy and ungrateful he was. I put the cage back together which is more then half the work of it, considering I had to wash all the fleece also.

I’ve been married to my current wife for three years. We dated for 2 years before getting married. Before meeting my current wife I had been married to my “high school sweetheart” for well over a decade.

My late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. It was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and I didn’t start dating again for several years after the fact. I never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

I’ve always had a momento from my previous marriage. It was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. She gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. Before meeting my current wife I would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

When I met my current wife she wasn’t comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. So I started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it’s an extremely important item to me. For a time she accepted that until recently.

Over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she’d bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding I get rid of it. I can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but I had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... Why can’t she accept it’s very important to me?

Long story short, when I was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. When I found out I broke down because it was literally the last thing I had to remember my late wife.

 I don’t know. Maybe I am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. AITA?

12797,16376,"AITA that I expressed my dislike of a something my girlfriend did in the bedroom?. GF and I (both 30's), been together just shy of 18 months. Have a healthy, regular sex life- there's some repetition of what we do, but probably because we found our groove. 

GF gave me a bj, finished in a handy which is pretty uncommon, I guess she wanted to mix it up. I came on my stomach and she then licked it off. I was a bit disgusted by it, I didn't say anything but it was obvious I guess as she picked up on it. 

She pushed me and I just said I didn't know why I don't like it, I just found it a bit, well, icky. She mentioned she gives me a bj to completion at least a couple of times a week and that doesn't bother me and it's essentially the same which is a fair point I guess. However even then she knows I don't like kissing after. 

Now she's all upset and I'm a bit cpnfused, we can't always like everything and I didn't say anything or try to make her feel bad. I don't know, I understand this is completely trivial, yet here we are.

So, AITA?

It would be one thing if you just didn’t like it, that’s something you should’ve waited until after sex and just nicely mentioned you weren’t a fan of it. You did not need to make a disgusted face and tell her it was gross.

Also, not kissing after a BJ is generally seen as immature behavior, she loves you and is willing to not only suck your dick but let you come in her mouth and you’re going to refuse to kiss her after?

57886,72698,"AITA for pumping my own gas ?. Last night , I was hanging out with an old friend when I realized I needed some gas. I pulled into a Kwik Fill , which unbeknownst to me is a station which has a pump attendant who pumps the gas for you. As a bit of background I live in the North Eastern part of the US, so heavy snow and freezing temperatures are pretty common. When I pulled up to the pump, nobody was outside, so as I normally would I swiped my card and began pumping my gas. At this point a man in his early 50s comes running out saying something along the lines of “Hey my job is to pump the gas, you can hop back in your car.” Now I’m already nearly done with about $8 out of the $10 I was putting in already pumped, and it is freezing cold and flurrying. So, I say something like “Nah man no worries I’m almost done, thank you though.” I wanted to give the guy a tip because I know that’s how they make a lot of their money , but I only had $3 dollars in cash on me. I decide it’s better than nothing, so I pull out the money and reach out towards him saying “Here you go dude, it’s cold and I’m finished anyways, but I appreciate it.” He paused and looked at me with an angry and twisted face, before snatching the $3 bucks and muttering something under his breath while he walked back towards the gas station.

53145,66703,"AITA: Is my friend the asshole for often leaving on nights out when he goes out with his girlfriend and her friends. Just to be clear, this situation is something my friend does, not me. I can provide some further info if people have questions, but not all the info.

My friend (24m Irish) has been dating his girlfriend (22f Brazilian) for 11 months now. She is in Ireland studying English part time and that is where she met many of her friends. Most of her roommates are also Brazilian, they are all also in Ireland studying English.

My friend tries his best to go out and make an effort to be friendly towards his girlfriend's friends on nights out and is very patient with them as he knows English is not their first language. However, anytime they go out, after about 15 minutes his girlfriend and all her friends switch to Portuguese and he is left out of the conversation. The only English he will hear on the night out will be his girlfriend asking him something unrelated to what she and her friends were talking about.

He gets very uncomfortable and feels very unwelcome on these nights out. None of them have poor English, they are all very good at it and have no issues getting by speaking English when they need to. Recently he has started just leaving his girlfriend and her friends in the club or pub and going home alone as he just doesn't feel like he is wanted on the night out since they won't include him. He will make an excuse like being tired or he is going in to work overtime the next morning so he can't stay late etc.

He has expressed how he feels about these nights in the past but nothing really changes. He speaks no Portuguese at all, beyond like thank you and how to ask for certain food. Small things. Not even remotely conversational. Their whole relationship is in English and she is more than happy with that as she often says herself that she moved to Ireland to learn English and perfect it. Her English is very impressive. She thinks he is an asshole for leaving when he feels left out like that even though she doesn't really do anything to include him. Other friends that we know have a split view on this. It's pretty much 50/50.

I figured I would post here to try and get more of a definitive who's right and who's wrong in this situation. Am I the asshole?","NTA - He's told them how he keeps feeling left out and they don't seem to make an effort to include him.

31169,39381,"AITA for saying asexual people don't have to ""come out""?. One of my coworkers came in today with a flag pin on her shirt. I asked about it at lunch since I didn't recognize the flag and she told me it was the asexual pride flag and she was wearing it in honor of pride month. I know the basics of asexuality (people who aren't sexually attracted to anyone), but I don't know a lot more about that. I asked her if asexuality is really considered part of the LGBT community since not being attracted to anyone isn't the same as being attracted to the same sex. She told me asexual people are definitely part of the community and while they don't face all the same struggles as other LGBT people, they still have to face discrimination and come out as well. I asked if coming out is really necessary since people generally don't care who is or isn't having sex and it's honestly kind of too much information. I really believe there's no reason for an asexual person to tell people who aren't their partners that they're asexual; it's a little weird going around telling people you don't want to have sex. She got annoyed at me and told me it's more complicated than that and she didn't want to get into it more, then she left to go back to her desk. My girlfriend said later that I was kind of a dick, but I don't think I did anything wrong just by asking a few questions. AITA?. Am I the asshole?","YTA. ~~I don’t know my feelings as to whether or not they a a part of the LGBTQ+ community specifically~~, but asexual people often *do* have to come out. Sex is SUCH a huge part of society and culture and so on and it is incredibly difficult to insist that it isn’t your thing when everyone is shoving sex down your throat. Asexual people can also still be attracted to people of the same gender (minus sexual attraction), which in my opinion would undoubtedly make them a part of the community.

Either way, being asexual is tough. Maybe in different ways than being gay, but it’s fucking hard. Asexual pride makes perfect sense to me.

Edit: and it’s not only partners that asexuals have to come out to. Friends and family and doctors may also pressure asexuals about sex and sexual activity. And for those who are sex repulsed, that could be pretty damn unpleasant even more so.

I’m 22 years old, recovering drug addict, with over 250 days clean, but with a criminal record and I live with my parents.

My parents are strict, and one of their rules is when the suns down you sleep, when the suns up you’re up.

Last Saturday I stayed up all night playing video games (osrs if anyone cares) and on Sunday my family decided to skip church, so I decided to just sleep during the day. My dad came downstairs and got upset telling me to get out of bed. I got up... then went back to sleep. This happened several times with him yelling at me every 5-10 mins, I explained that I had been up all night, that I didn’t want to argue while I was tired and a little unstable, plus I had homework that I needed to get some sleep to do. My plan was to sleep til 3, but I never communicated this. My dad persisted in his efforts. I locked the door and he yelled and banged on the door, then got my door key, opened it up, and kicked me out.

I left, and eventually he called me back because my mom said she was afraid I’d relapse back on the street.

39531,49672,"AITA for enjoying phone sex without my wife. Throwaway account, obviously. 

My wife and I have a beautiful marriage of nearly 20 years. She’s amazing and we get along well. She never thinks about sex, though. She will go months without ever thinking... “gee we haven’t had sex in months.”

She doesn’t dislike it. She just never thinks of it. She says that she likes to have had sex, but doesn’t particularly enjoy it at the time. Literally, any time I initiate, she will happily do it, but tbh, I don’t really wanna have sex with someone that isn’t into it. 

So... my AITA. Rather than initiate sex with my wife, who doesn’t really want it, I masturbate... usually before bed. She is completely aware of this and encourages me when she notices (mostly because it gets her off the hook). She admits to feeling guilty for going months without thinking of sex.  Of course, I tell her everything is fine, and it is. It works for us. 

But, from time to time, I enjoy 1:1 video sex via one of the sleezy cam sites. It’s fun from time to time.

... But I haven’t mentioned that I do this. 

I don’t think she would mind, but I do think that if I told her it would make her feel worse about not wanting to have sex... which would lead to her pretending to want to have sex, which is a complete turn off for me.

A few minutes later, my mom was saying that I was giving her pushback on a lot of things, and I told her as respectfully as I could that I didn’t recall fighting her on anything recently.\
My dad then said “[I]must be a miserable person”(though I heard it as “[I am] a miserable person”).

My little brother has never had a girlfriend. He acts quite awkward around my wife and other women from what I’ve seen. He came to my house last week to see the baby and he noticed the bottles in the fridge. 


Yesterday, my wife and I, along with our baby, went over to my parent’s house. My brother knows since he’s in our family group chat. He texted me when I was at my parent’s house that he bought my baby some cool clothes and will drop them off. He knows my front door pin to get in.

So, my wife tasted it and said it was cow milk, not her milk. She told me to taste it too and compare it with the two other bottles in the fridge. That bottle indeed tasted much more like cow milk than the other two.

We both quit our jobs and became close friends, he introduced me straight away to his girlfriend and this girl is a gem. We hang out a lot the three of us and I love both of them now, even if I knew him first. 

Today, we were hanging out at the beach for the fireworks and my guy friend was in a bad mood. I asked him what was wrong and he said he had a bad headache. I asked him if he wanted me to give him a head massage because I usually give massages to my friends & family.

However, he's pretty tall so I couldn't give it to him while sitting. He then put his head on my laps and I was massaging his head while talking to his girlfriend. I didn't realise it was an uncomfortable situation before seeing the girlfriend's face, which was a bit sceptical. I then quickly put an end to it and sat back at my place.

I'm scared I made her mad, even if she was super nice to me the rest of the evening, I find myself completely stupid for not realising it would be super awkward.

2874,3569,"AITA for giving my girlfriend a nose ring ultimatum?. I am really grossed out by nose rings, and they make me pretty uncomfortable.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about two years now (we're in our mid-20s), and we live together. We usually don't have a lot of friction, so the past few days have been very unusual.

After dinner on Saturday, we were talking and the topic of nose rings came up. I mentioned that I'm really grossed out by nose rings, and that they make me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend said she really wanted one, and had been planning on getting one sometime in the future. This led to a pretty big argument.

Nose rings just really gross me out. I don't judge people who get them, and I understand other people must find them nice to look at, I just don't. I really love my girlfriend, but this is a dealbreaker for me. I told her that I really didn't want her to get one. She got upset, and told me that she feels like saying that was controlling of me, and that she should be the one in charge of her body. I told her that I agree she should be in charge of her body, but that they really made me uncomfortable. I told her that I understand her wanting to get one, and that if she really wants one then she should do it, but that I would be uncomfortable being in a relationship with her if she did.

This really upset her, and one of the arguments she made after I told her that really made me think. She asked me whether I would break up with her if she was injured in some way that made looking at her uncomfortable, and I told her I didn't think I would, because supporting her would be the right thing to do. She told me she felt like I was being hypocritical, because in both cases I wouldn't be comfortable. I can kind of see where she's coming from, but it feels really different to me. 

I'm kind of looking for a sanity check. I don't want to be controlling, but nose rings really do feel like a dealbreaker to me. Am I being an asshole here?. Am I the asshole?","I can't say YTA but I can't say you're NTA, either.

To preface, I am a Buddhist, and while avoiding animal products is not required by my faith, for me, it is an important aspect of my practice of it. My avoidance of alcohol dates back to when I was thirteen, and my then sixteen year-old brother had to have his stomach pumped. My family and friends are well aware of both. 

Moving to the matter itself, every year, my hosts a large Halloween party. Usually, there are around two hundred guests in attendance. For a variety of reasons, my parents are unable to host the event this year, and they asked me to do so in their stead. 

When they asked, I said I would be willing, but I immediately reminded them of my beliefs and avoidance of both alcohol and animal products and how I did not think I would be a suitable host because of them. They said it would be fine. Earlier today, my mother called me. I had emailed her the menu and guest list for final approval. She was furious. 

Apparently, I was unclear when I said I was uncomfortable. My parents thought that when I agreed, I agreed to serve meat and alcohol. They are saying it will be a huge issue at the party. 

I once again suggested having someone else plan it, but, as they pointed out, it’s less than a month away from the party. We really don’t have time for someone else to take over the planning.

12887,16497,"AITA for not wanting to help my mother out of her abusive relationship?. Obligatory I'm on mobile and this is a throwaway account

Now, I realize the title sounds really bad - but there is a little background

I don't have a good relationship with my mother. She was manipulative and neglectful to me and my brothers, sometimes borderline abusive. She would often disappear for days at a time with her boyfriends and this became a larger issue when I was a teenager.

Its also worth noting that she has several physical and mental health issues, which I never blamed her for and I can understand it made raising children difficult, so I can't completely hate her.

She started seeing her now-husband when I was 14, and he moved in with us shortly after they started dating. We all got evicted from our home when I was 15, which I later found out was due to him gambling our rent money away. After that I lived with family friends and my relationship with my mother has been hanging by a thread ever since. I wasn't invited to their wedding.

Over the years that they have been together, he has kicked her out of their house on several occasions, cheated on her, been in jail multiple times for drug possession and physical abuse (from a previous relationship) charges, gambled their rent money, threatened to leave her, and hit her. Whenever this happens, I have become the good daughter and come to my mother's side regardless of my shaky relationship with her and listened to her cry about the things he's done, tell me about how she needs help finding an apartment and she is going to divorce him, done what I can to support her, and then watched her immediately forgive him when he walked in the door.

So when I got the text from my brother that her husband had hit her, I didn't really care to do anything.

Now I understand that abusive relationships are incredibly hard to get out of. At the same time, it's incredibly frustrating and emotionally draining to me to see this happen over and over again. We don't speak to each other, and when we do it's the same broken record. I have had plans of cutting her out of my life completely when I graduate college because I don't feel comfortable having her in my life, but at the same time I feel guilty for not jumping to help her.

31380,39645,"AITA for not wanting a dog?. Married to a lovely wife, with two kids in elementary school. We both work full time in demanding jobs and manage to keep the household running without a lot of outside help, as our families are all across the country. My wife has known from the beginning that I am a cat person, and don't really like or feel comfortable around dogs. We have talked in the past about having a dog, but in my mind that was more joking around (in the spirit of 'maybe someday we'll have goats or chickens') than making plans. We currently have two cats, one of which my wife sprung on me unexpectedly the night before an important presentation at a new job for which we had moved cross country. I love both of the cats and enjoy their presence in the house. 

I found out yesterday my wife had formed a 'secret plan' with the kids to begin planning to get a dog at the end of the summer. I strongly objected, and it's lead to a volatile argument. My stance is that we don't keep secrets from each other, and that if we were to get a dog, I will not lift a finger to take care of it or make it a financial priority, as we are still digging out of debt and I'm not looking for another source of expenses. 

When the topic has come up with my kids over the past year I have told them that if they keep their rooms clean and put away their shoes without being asked for a year, they can have a dog. Because they are 9 and 6, this was not a goal I expected them to achieve, so that was my way of dealing with it. 

This argument has surfaced other tensions in our marriage. I feel that because I earn 2/3 of our household income and manage all our finances I deserve some direction in how we manage our house and budget. My wife feels that because my career has moved us back and forth across the country she deserves some 'gives' in things like, well, having a dog. 

We had a volatile conversation about this last night, during which my wife made a compelling and impassioned plea for having a dog, and how much the kids would enjoy it.

Me : So me and my boyfriend are able to use his moms car but we have to drive his dad to and from cambridge first so we will probably be there by 3 hopefully. What about you are you already there 

Friend: No, I thought u guys were takin the bus

Me: Okay and we were but then we wanted to check if there was any other option first also do we have to renew our bus passes at all? Like on our student cards 

Friend: My bus card worked fine yesterday. I dunno about today.

Me: Okay cause I was worried mine wouldnt work but that good that yours was working still

12607,16142,"AITA For pulling out of a group project at the last minute?. For the past month or so in school we had to come up with an idea for a product and make it and pitch it ( tomorrow 5th March ).

I usually like to take responsibility so I’ve done most of the work for our group along side a lot of other projects during that month so I was really caught up in schoolwork etc.

I worked really hard on the project as there were pretty fat rewards from it and that especially got me to try and win so I worked my ass off.

Tomorrow we have to prepare a stand before we pitch which showcases our product etc. So, earlier I was drawing up huge letters to put up for our stand which said our brand name. Since our product involves a glass bottle one of my group members texted me

Can you make a design for the bottle

So I finish the letters and start on a design. I will be honest but I didn’t put 100% into it. We were almost done so I was knackered and just wanted to finish it, so I rush the drawings and I get these texts

Wtf have you been doing

Those are the most shitty designs I’ve seen in my life

Now I was really offended, I’m open to criticism but that’s too far.

So. At 5pm the day before our pitch I switch to another group and bring anything with me that could help my new group and delete or destroy anything that could help my old group.

After this I felt really bad because the other group members had done nothing wrong (and nothing in the project) and now I’ve bestowed a shitty deadline on them.

57146,71767,"WIBTA if I didn't let my girlfriends mum store things in my freezer?. Hi guys. Just a bit of background on the situation. My girlfriend and I have been together around 3 years,living together for about 8 months. We initially were living at her parents place, however they split up recently and sold their house. We were intending on moving out into our own flat, however her mum asked if we could move in with her, so we could help cover costs/allow her to rent a nicer place.

We agreed, as we ended up paying renting an area of the house as opposed to going out on our own. We also ended up pretty much fully independent to her as we have our own level with a kitchen, bathroom, washing machine etc. As a result, my girlfriend and I have remained independent, starting to buy our own appliances/utensils etc while we can afford it so when it comes time to move out, we should have minimal furnishing costs.

Recently I purchased a chest freezer for my food as I do alot of fishing/hunting which results in alot of meat for me to store. I explained when I bought it that is was door mine and my girlfriends food, and we would prefer not to stor anything else in there unless it was really necessary. It currently has a bit of meat and about 13kg of curly fries (don't ask why) but isn't anywhere near full as its summer where I'm from and I'm off hunting/fishing alot in the coming months. Today when I got home, there was a bulk amount of dog food and prawn cutlets stacked in our freezer.

WIBTA if I asked her mum to find somewhere else to store her stuff? It seems like she's taken the opportunity to buy bulk food and store it in my freezer, when i said I'd only be happy to store stuff there if it was an emergency..

51592,64725,"AITA for shutting down my ""surprise party"" and not being grateful for it?. My husband and I have been trying for over 10 years to have a child together, in between fertility treatments and adoption. We got matched with a mother a few months ago who lives out of state and she chose us. The plan always was that when she went into labor, we’d fly to be there and stay there for a few days to a week, just to get all the paperwork done, make sure everything was situated, etc. In advance, we asked that my sister be able to dog sit/house sit at a moment’s notice since we had a due date but obviously baby’s can come a week before/after, anytime around that date. She agreed.

So, the baby is born. We’re so happy and excited. That first week is exhausting, plus we have to fly back with him. We had called my sister with a head’s up the night before saying we were. When we arrive back, our house is packed with family and friends, all there to meet baby. I was overwhelmed and just…not understanding. My sister said it was an “impromptu baby shower” since I didn’t have one (it didn’t seem right in case the birth mom changed her mind). Everyone wants to hold him, see him, asking a million questions and I just want to sleep. He’s also fussing because it’s loud, bright and he doesn’t know any of these people. I don’t care about people holding him, but I really just wanted this first night to be about us and for it to be a few people at a time.

Eventually, I go into my room and shut the door. My husband comes in a bit later and asks what I want. I tell him to get my sister and tell her to get everyone out. I’m exhausted and aware I might sound rude, but this isn’t how I imagined our first night home. I’m not in the mood to play houseguest. My husband agrees and is nice enough to be the bad guy. My sister and him get everyone to leave, and she promises the next day, she’ll come back to clean up.

When she does, however, she calls me rude and ungrateful. She says that I should’ve just enjoyed the party and people would’ve helped me with the baby. I said I didn’t want that, and how could she think I would after flying 5 hours with an infant? She got mad, finished cleaning and left. We haven’t really talked in the few months since, and a lot of the family is on her side.

In conversation I mentioned to a friend (call her Sarah) that I was buying a new bedroom suit when I moved in October. She was very interested in buying the old one off me and I said sure I would sell it to her. Why not. My husband expressed he didn't want to sell or buy a new one so I let her know we couldn't sell. Then I later convinced him to let me buy a new one and then let Sarah know I could sell after all! The main problem being that we were using all of the furniture until the day of the move. 

I had trouble finding people to help me move but my husband's brother who lives an hour away was willing to help if he could have the bedroom suit. I really needed the help so I said yes. 

I sent Sarah a text saying ""Hey Sarah! I know you were wanting to buy the bedroom suit off me but I needed help moving and my brother in law offered in exchange for the bedroom suit so I accepted. Sorry!""

Her response took me off guard

""Well that's just great. That's the second time you fucked me over with that bedroom suit. Next time we are together remind me to explain seller etiquette.""

I don't even know what she means by ""second time"". Perhaps when I said I would sell and my husband said no.

17834,22681,"AITA? My friend died without ever speaking to me again.. This has been bugging me for two years. Friend and I had been chums since high school, I was maid of honor, she and her hubby would come visit me in Arizona every year, all good. But there was always an edge to her, she wouldn’t open up. So when Friend was diagnosed with liver cancer, I was determined to be her best friend ever, we were going to bond, and no matter what happened, she would know I was there for her.

When I flew to Michigan to visit, she acted like she hated me. Snotty comments, stony silence, I was absolutely baffled. I thought she was just being pissy like she could be sometimes, so I didn’t push it.

The next day Friend fainted, cracked her head on the counter and passed out. She came to, called 911 and me, I met the EMT’s in her driveway and rode to the hospital with her. Once she was admitted, she continued with the attitude that she wasn’t happy I was there, even though she’s the one who called when she fell. Her neighbor came to the hospital, chirping and upbeat about how “this was nothing, you can beat this”, about the cancer.

Neighbor gave me a ride back to my car at the house, and she kept going on about Friend beating the cancer, she’ll be fine. I was exhausted and weepy from the past two days of drama, and snapped “this has a 5 year survival rate of 2%” as I got out of the car.

Friend was sent home and we were supposed to watch fireworks, but I had an early flight and decided I wasn’t going to go. She gave me the silent treatment when I came over to say goodbye, and with her mom and husband in the room, I didn’t find it appropriate to confront her on her attitude. After another 30 minutes of silence or abrupt yes or no answers, I gave up and left. Cried all the way home. We never spoke again.

Friend died a year later, her husband texted me the news and told me she spent a lot of quality time with family and friends, which really hurt. I thought of her constantly, but the way she treated me put my walls up and I couldn’t bring myself to reach out. Am I The Asshole for walking away?. Am I the asshole?","As someone who worked in oncology, I'm going to go with NAH. But I do think you were a bit inconsiderate.

This isn't to say you were being shitty- It sounds like you were trying to support her the best way *you* knew how. Did you try asking her ""What can I do for you? How can I help you?""

People battling cancer have different needs, react differently, have different emotional responses to their diagnoses. Some people want the people in their corner like you, some want people who overflow the positivity like the neighbor, some people want people who ignore it, some want people who will just sit there and agree about how fucked their situation is, and the list goes on and on.

This just happened, and I’m actually confused.

So for months myself and other coworkers have found a doppelganger  of one of our desk mates. They look almost identical and we have all individually seen her. We have been making jokes with our desk mate... let’s call her Amy .. by acting surprised she could be in two places at once. Funny enough we have never seen both of them at the same time. It’s been serious enough that our boss at one time got mad at Amy for walking around downstairs during an important project (wasn’t a big deal, but we did have to explain she was here). I think you get the point, this girl is identical from afar and looks similar up close.

Now to the actual story, I was walking with Amy and I actually spot her with her doppelgänger and I’m actually excited because I know this is the first time any of us have seen them both at the same time.

So I tell Amy and her twin actually approaches us and stops. This is where I f**k up, I say “wow are you guys related or something”... Amy’s twin is actually excited too, and says hi and starts introducing herself while our Amy is clearly acting off character and distant. 

Amy’s twin is even receptive to taking a photo, but Amy tells me she is leaving so I take the hint and we leave. I realize she wasn’t super happy about the encounter (but man they actually look very identical ; hair, makeup, etc) 

The second f**k up I made was going back to the office and letting everyone know that Amy and twin finally met up. Everyone stopped what they were doing and approached Amy with questions, asking about pictures as we have all been waiting for this day.

Anyways, ever since she got remarried to me she has changed, I felt like I got pushed aside for being the oldest & my younger siblings got more attention from my new stepdad and her. And after moving out I learn about many family events way after they occur, ie; my cousin being hit by a car and dying, cancer in my grandparents, relatives visiting from out of town, etc. And recently she and my stepdad, alone, have been traveling out of the country and have visited the same place/country 4 times already this year alone (not including the previous 2 years). They have already announced they will be moving there once my last 2 siblings graduate from highschool and move out.

Just recently my mom brought up that she won’t be in town for thanksgiving at all, we have always done it together at my grandparent’s, and will be in said country with just my stepdad.

If you are familiar with Destiny, there are things called raids. These are long missions that take 1-3 hours to complete, and required great communication and attention. When Destiny 2 came out, and I got to a decent Level, I promised my friend I would run a raid with him. Now to start of, he only just hit the required level to start the raid, but still wasn’t the recommended level meaning we( the rest of my team) already had to carry him through it.

It was 11 am, and all of us stocked up on snacks, had lunch, and could play until 12 am, so we could spare a few minutes.

Because if this, I was usually at home and most of my activities were with my family. Over a year ago, I began dating someone who I am very happily still with. I have never had a SO before him, and my brother has never had a SO, so spending time with someone I love (in a non platonic way) outside of my family was a new thing for my mother.

Of course, seeing as this was a new thing for her, my mother wasn’t super comfortable with me suddenly being away from home a lot more and spending a lot of time with my new SO. I respected this, and made sure he was spending time with my family as well and that I wasn’t spending too much time with him and his family.

Now, onto my story. Basically, we're 8-10 guys, who all know each other irl. Me and the server owner have known each other for around 10ish years, and we're basically best friends. Now, about half of the server plays League of Legends, and the other half makes a few jokes about it. Nothing serious, usually it's stuff like: ""Why don't you stop playing that shitty game and play \[insert random game the whole server could play together\]."" It's usually all in good fun, ( at least that's what I thought) and we all have a good laugh about it. But today was different. I make the same joke as always, but instead of the usual laugh all of us have, the server owner creates a voice channel and locks it for all of the people that don't play League.   


It's also not the first time he's done things that are - in my opinion at least - a misuse of the admin priviliges on the discord server. He moves people into different channels randomly, mutes people for everyone, and stuff like that. It's usually only small pranks that last for maybe 10 seconds tops, and we usually laugh about it. It's just today that I've realized that stuff like that has gotten more and more frequent.

16835,21428,"AITA for not being road aware of a bike rider?. Throwaway account here as I don't want anyone to identify me.

So this just happened this morning and I'm genuinely wondering whether or not I'm the asshole here. I got off the train today with a friend and we were walking to school. The school we go to is located pretty close to a city and therefore there are normally quite a lot of cars around. Anyway, my friend and I were just talking about some school stuff when we come across this street we have to cross. The station exits on a main road and you have to walk down a bit before crossing this small street. This street is usually very busy with cars going both in and out onto the main road. This isn't a school crossing as well and is just a normal street. It's very small and takes literally 2-3 seconds to walk across. My friend and I reached the street and there's not many people waiting to cross. I quickly look both ways and see there are no cars approaching. I begin to walk onto the street to the other side with a few people as well and so does my friend who is a few metres behind me.  However, as he also begins to cross, this bike rider comes riding in from the main road to the street we're crossing. I didn't realise as I was already halfway across the street and didn't see the bike in my peripheral vision  So I immediately try to evade the bike. The bike rider also does as well, but we end of doing the awkward thing where we both try to evade each other but continue blocking each other. However, that only happened maybe once and twice and he didn't have to stop riding or put his feet down to control his balance. I get across the road and my friend soon does and he immediately starts roasting me, saying how much I ''dogged'' the bike rider and how I have no road awareness, and how I should have stopped and apologized. I respond by saying it was an accident and how I didn't see him as I was halfway across the street and the street crossing is located right next to the main road, so I wouldn't have enough time anyway to see the bike rider. He then continues roasting me on how I have no road awareness and how I was completely in the wrong here. He wasn't like super pissed at me but didn't jokingly tell it at me as well. I thought a lot about it today and I'm still not sure if AITA.

59987,75300,"AITA for questioning my friend's sexuality a few weeks before his wedding?. I have been friends with Joe for a few decades. Joe comes for a conservative family (Jewish) and his parents have always  talked about him eventually getting married and having kids. The pressure of being in a straight relationship and having kids was huge. His mother would talk non-stop about her future grandbabies and his eventual wedding.

 So, Joe has certain mannerisms that people typically associate with gay men - lisp, hand gestures, certain walk. He's a school teacher. I don't believe that being a certain way or someone's profession is what makes you gay but it's always thrown people off. From time to  time, if Joe would mention a girlfriend to a new acquaintance or friend, I would get questioned later on in private about whether Joe is actually straight. 

I have never heard Joe talk about a boyfriend and we had never discussed his sexuality openly. He had had on and off relationships  but he always had an excuse about why they weren't right for him. It never seemed quite right. Finally he reunited with his high school sweetheart and they got engaged pretty quickly. 

I met joe for lunch one day and I finally worked up the courage to ask him about the quick engagement, the decades of questions that I had encountered from various people, and whether his family was making it difficult for him to be his true self.  I told him that I'd accept him no matter what and I didn't want him to make a mistake in case he was trying to appease his family but I'd shut up about it if I was wrong. Joe looked very offended and said that maybe I wasn't a true friend if  didn't know his true intentions. He told me not to show up at the wedding. This was three years ago and we haven't talked since. So, I was the asshole?. Am I the asshole?",Yta. You're judging his sexuality based solely on his mannerisms.

When we were at the friend's house, we had a really good time, and I felt bad about having to leave. I started get up and say it was time to go. My SO started to get up as well, but without thinking and in front of friends I asked the SO, 'unless you want to stay and I can pick you up later?' and immediately knew I shouldn't have said it because I put them in a position to make the decision in front of friends.

6742,8615,"AITA for driving with a funeral procession?. This happened around 2012, but it was brought up today at dinner while eating with my parents.

When I was in college, I would go home and visit as students do. Whenever I would drive back I would normally have to stop about an hour or so before I arrived to get gas, as the last hour stretch was very windy and there weren't any gas stations along the way. I always stopped at the same gas station.

On this instance, I did my normal routine. Started pumping gas, went in to use the bathroom and grab a drink. When I pulled in, there was normal traffic with nothing out of the ordinary. I finished gassing up, got in my truck, and went to pull out. As I'm pulling up to turn onto the road I need to, there's was this long ass line of car, all in the right lane of a 2 lane road (4 lane? 2 lanes going each direction). I'm talking probably around 80-100 cars. I didn't see any cops and had no clue what was going on. 

So, once there was a little break, I pulled out into the left lane and just started driving, not really paying attention to anybody in the right lane. I did, however, notice that there were about a dozen cars pulled into the shoulder of the traffic going in the opposite direction. On this stretch, there were 3 stop ~~signs~~ lights I had to get through before I hit the highway again, all of the lights were working as normal. I hit a red light at the second light and stopped. The line, however, kept going. I waited until the light turned green and then kept driving. I very quickly learned that there was a cemetery immediately after the 3rd light, where all of the cars were turning into. After I passed the cemetery I was quickly pulled over by a cop who was parked at the entrance and given a strong talking to and basically told not to come back to that town. 

So, am I an asshole for not stopping?

Fast forward and we've done the shoot, I'm waiting to see shots, when suddenly one is already posted (a month early) without my knowledge. I didn't get to help pick the photo, and it being early created a LOT of extra work on my side. 


We release two to public, so when the time came to pick the second we disagreed about which one. They told me to trust them, that theirs was better and people would like it more. We argued, I told them that I was upset and felt steamrolled and they said 'sorry you feel that way. Fine, I'll just shut my mouth and show up and take pictures.' but that isn't what I wanted. I wanted to work together, and when I told them how I was feeling, I felt brushed off like I had no right to be hurt. They apologized for posting the first photo, but said all the extra work it created for me was no big deal so maybe I'm overreacting. They said it's my fault for not just saying I didn't want to do their idea, but I didn't mind doing their idea. I just hated feeling like my ideas weren't even good enough to acknowledge, and that they picked the first photo without me, and now I wasn't getting to pick the second. I got more and more upset and said 'fine, since you obviously know what you're doing do whatever you want.' They posted their choice, knowing it upset me.

51601,64735,"AITA for saying that my cousin is a psycho?. (mandatory apologies- I'm on a mobile and English isn't my first language). Also trigger warning- animal cruelty.

Before telling the story I should mention that I kinda dislike this cousin, because she often looks down on me and has never really treated me as her equal. There is a bit of an age gap between us (I'm 22, she's 35), but I don't think it's a valid reason to mistreat someone. Also, I love animals in all shapes and sizes, so it might be the reason why I reacted this way. 

Anyway, around a week ago my cousin's kid (4) was hospitalized so my mom and I decided to visit her. The kid is OK, I have nothing against her. When we went there the cousin was present too (obviously).

I don't really remember how it happened, but we started talking about ""creepy"" animals, such as lizards, frogs, mice, etc. The cousin said that she hates mice and when they lived in their old house basically in the middle of nowhere, she found one in her bedroom. Then she caught the mouse, crushed it with an iron and asked her dad to dispose of what was left. She told the story with a smile on her face, as if it was just a fun little memory, no big deal.

No one really responded and mom quickly changed the subject to something else, but I was really disturbed, because:
1. She just told everyone how she crushed an animal to death. 
2. She said it while cuddling her 4y/o, who obviously heard the story. (though she didn't seem to react) 

For the rest of the time there (it wasn't that long) I was quiet and only spoke to my mom when we were in the car. I asked something along the lines of ""is it just me, or (cousin's name) is a bit of a psycho"", while my mom basically shouted at me for being rude and disrespectful, also ""mice are pests, it's not that important"". Yeah, fair enough, but what's up with the smile and why would someone say such thing when their kid is literally next to them. 

This is not the only animal-related insident that I find to be kinda questionable. I remember a long time ago they (the cousin and her sister) used to own a hamster that they kept in a large glass jar. Also, around 5 years ago their family had a dog that lived with them only like 3/4 of the year (in winter for some reason they would give him away to their neighbors). It was a guard dog who would spend his time outside, tied to his house, with little exercise and human contact, because he was ""vicious"". A few years ago their father passed away, so thay decided to place the dog in an animal shelter.

Anyway, my mom and I a little argument and now I'm starting to think that maybe I was wrong. What do you think? AITA?. Am I the asshole?","NTA only psychos act pleased when they crush the life out of something that isn’t a bug, and even sometimes when it is a bug.",0,0,0,0,1

I don't know why but I shared some ""what if"" thoughts with her about breaking up and how our relationship is not necessarily rock-solid from my point of view.

My sister and my bio mom have been in my life for as long as I’ve been alive and I was adopted by two amazing people. My mom and dad always let me have a relationship with her and my biological sister ever since they moved to the same town as I was in. When I was a sophomore in high school they began being extremely rude to me and treating me like they didn’t want anything to do with me. The three of us had a huge falling out and we didn’t talk to each other for about 4 years. 

One night I was with friends and they asked what my bio dad look like. I showed them then saw that he had passed away a month prior. And no one told me. Obviously I was upset and expressed my feelings to them to which they really didn’t care. 

About 10 months later my bio mom texted me and told me she had cancer. I was extremely hesitant to start a relationship with her again due to how horribly I had been treated from the past 5 years. I texted her and talked to her on the phone 1-2 times a month. 4 months later she had been put into hospice and only had days to live. I visited her and we actually had a very nice talk. She passed away the same day that I visited her.

My boyfriend of 7 years (22M, we'll call him ""Alex"") met this guy (17M, we'll call him ""Brad"") a couple years ago and everyone has been decent friends with the guy for awhile. More recently some pretty big arguments between this new guy and another one of our friends (21M, we'll call him ""Chris"") have been going on, but last night a more serious argument occurred which changed my mind about this guy.

Chris brought up some messages where Brad had confessed romantic feelings for my boyfriend Alex, talking about ""oh if only OP wasn't in the way"", those kinds of messages. I obviously was not aware of this, though I had some suspicions with how he acted towards my boyfriend. But apparently, my boyfriend was aware of this, and thought I had known.

I told my boyfriend I wasn't comfortable with him being friends with Brad because of his romantic feelings towards him, and the fact that he blatantly stated to Chris in messages that he wanted to be with my boyfriend, if only I weren't in the way. Cut to now, my boyfriend doesn't want to talk to me because I'm asking him to ditch a friend, and has told me that I'm being insecure for being bothered by this.

I come from a somewhat broken family. My mom and dad split up years ago due to my dad's constant cheating and arguing. It's better for them to be apart. When that happened, my dad moved to another state and barely kept in contact but he's my dad so I still love him. This post isn't about him though.

My dad has a sister, and they have a whole family on his side. Multiple cousins, uncle, all that. Like we come from a huge family.. None of them talk to me or my siblings at all. Ever.

My dad's mom is still alive, and she'd been living with my dad's sister for a few years. My aunt never answered when we called, never responded to messages, nothing. They essentially already cut us all off, meaning we could not have any contact with my grandma.

23905,30302,"AITA for having the irrational fear of touch and not wanting to be hugged/kissed by family and friends?. I recently found a term for my fear of being touched and its effects. It's called Haphephobia. 

Haphephobia: ""...excessive or irrational fear of the situation (in this case, human touch)."" (What Is Haphephobia and How Can You Manage Fear of Touch?, Evans, 2017)

According to the resource above, it ""...causes an immediate anxiety response or panic attack..."" and it also ""...causes an immediate anxiety response or panic attack.""

Whenever people would touch me without being told beforehand that they planned to touch me or asked permission if they could touch me, it feels like they just burned me or hit me with a stick. If the body part was covered by clothes, I can pretend they didn't touch me but if it's on the hand, arm or any other exposed skin at the time, I would feel their hand on me for hours. 

At first, I though I was just germaphobic but disinfectant does nothing for my anxiety and I would have mini panic attacks. My family almost never notices because I've always been restless in small spaces and large crowds. But sometimes those small spaces help. It's one phobia on top of another but I have control on how small it is. 

Anyway, since my family is very affectionate to each other, they find it weird that I dodge or move away whenever someone would try to hug or kiss me. Whenever I meet people, I try to shake their hands because it's polite but it's very obvious that I'd rather be somewhere else and I'm aware that it's rude to them. 

My mother has told me that I'm cold, indifferent and snobbish. I'm really not. I just don't want people touching me without bring told they want to touch me. She thinks it's her fault for not hugging, kissing etc. me while I was younger and tell me that she thinks its her fault too. 

So, as much as its not good for my mental health, I just let them hug me whenever they want. I've told my family before that I don't like being touched, forget about telling them its a phobia because that's a one way trip to never ending therapy. Their way is to hug and kiss me as much as they can while I'm doing something else. 

It makes me jump and lock myself in the bathroom to calm down because I don't want them to see that I'm panicking ""for something not important.""

I have a fun and crazy co-worker who is always saying off the wall inapropriate things. For the most part it's funny but she's gotten sent to HR a few times over it from what I've heard. She's kind of known around the firm as the cooky aunt. So, today I say good morning to her and we get to talking and she brings up this Quentin Tarantino movie. She then begins to quote one of her favorite funny scenes from. She says two racial slurs one for blacks, one about Mexicans with absolutely no filter. I've heard her say wild stuff but I was pretty shocked. So I tell her calmy she can't say things like that. She jokinly says the Mexican slur a few times and I manage to change the subject. I leave her office and go about my day. So here's the thing, in all honesty, while I think it's appalling what she said I was not personally offended. I don't think she's racist or being malicious, I simply think she's dumb and has super loose lips. Because she's quoting I guess she thinks it's okay, and my two closest friends agree that it's wrong but not that big of a deal. She is not well respected in the firm because of behavior like this but she is next in line to become my manager.

My current manager jokes about leaving the firm frequently. This scares the crap out of most of my team because we don't want her managing us. She's incompetent, incapable of being direct and concise, wastes the team's time regularly by talking about her personal life, and can't make a decision to save her life. Yet when the manager is around she always says how busy she is even though she has the lightest workload...which is probably best. So here's my dilemma, I don't feel personally attacked, yet her overall lack of professionalism and general incompetence is tempting me to tell HR. My firm has a very strict policy and I'm almost certain she would be fired. She has two sons, a few houses, and a husband who owns a dealership making six figures according to her. Would I be the asshole if I did tell HR? I would hate to tell, but I would hate to have her as my manager even more.

My dad's brother and his wife have one daughter also, Susan, who is 16 years old.

Our two families would like to travel to France together next summer, and my parents have offered to pay for my entire trip on the condition that I room with my cousin Susan.

Susan and I are not close.  We barely know each other.  Mostly because I have a career on the other side of the country that keeps me busy and we have an age difference of about 30 years.

I refused my parents' offer to pay if I share a room with Susan.  I can pay for my own trip and get my own room.  I'm introverted and shy and I need personal private space to retreat to.  Because I'm an adult.

At this, my dad became unhinged and told me that I am an asshole for refusing to let Susan stay in my room, and that I would have to explain it to the whole family; he is not going to have my back.  He made it sound like they had all cooked up this plan together to get some privacy of their own and a free room for their kid.

&#x200B;

Background:

I'm adopted, my sister is as well. We both grew up knowing we were adopted. I was so lucky to be adopted by my parents. My family is fucking amazing.

&#x200B;

The reason my parents chose to adopt was because my mom was unable to get pregnant. They tried everything. My mom eventually had a miscarriage. She didn't know she was pregnant at the time. I think that was the turning point for them, that pregnancy wasn't possible for her.

&#x200B;

So now the real AITA Story:

&#x200B;

My mom saw a used pregnancy test in the trash and basically said ""I'm here for you, do you need to talk about anything, etc"" .

&#x200B;

It was negative. I knew it would be. Shoutout anxiety disorder. 

&#x200B;

Reassured her I was not pregnant, that got us to joking about if I was pregnant and I said to her ""No worries. If I was pregnant I'd yeet that ball of cells out with a pill.""

&#x200B;

The second I said that her face was just sad. She looked so hurt.  In no way was I trying to be mean.

Family is extremely important to my side of the family, so this is a huge problem for me when I don't get time with them. We live close to her family, and it uses half of my vacation allocation yearly which severely limits the time I get to see my own family.

The second issue is that last year my wife and I had a huge fight while we were there, and she tried to use her family against me while I was there. It didn't work, because thankfully they were all reasonable and told her what she was doing was wrong, but it was a HUGE embarrassment to me. She apologized profusely but this is a reoccurring issue with her that she knows I get sick missing my family, she knows how I feel isolated, and then she tries to involve them and have them gang up on me.

there was some amount of tension because of this, but i didn't think much about it. this week, we would've had practice on wednesday, which was not okay for me but i moved some stuff around so i can make it. i asked about it in the group chat and i got no response. for days.

then on sunday i wrote in again, so i would know when exactly we are planning to start. and then, the guitarist wrote me in private: ""hi, we have decided we didn't want to make music with you any more. you don't have enough time for this band""

i'm like, okay, fuck this, but i tell him all is good and no hard feelings. i tell him about how it would have been more tactful of them to actually meet me in person. i ask how long my kit can stay in the practice room and he says there's no rush taking it away.

The flight costs about $500-1,000. He's paid for his flight everyone he comes here, and I pay for mine every time I go there, except once, which we spilt. I work one a week minimum wage and he works 3 days and earns almost double so it's pretty fair.

The problem for me is, when I go there, he wants to game for 5+ hours with his friends every day. I can't join because there is only one computer and his friends don't have consoles. No split screen games or anything. I've said that if that's the case, I should be able to hang out with my friends while he's here, go out for 5+ hours with them. He says it is not the same because he is in the same room, but mentally he is not with me (he won't respond or anything). I've said 1-2 hours a day would be better but he does not agree and does not want any less time.

I'm fine when he goes to work for 8 hours every 3 days, but I also want to spend as much time as possible with him because of only seeing him a few times a year and paying upwards of $500 and flying 5k miles.

I will preface this by saying I was born in the US of A and have literally never been to another country in my life, so all the systems and stuff are American and whatever.

About a year ago now, I got access to my bank account, which is All well and good. I had a paper with my SS number to be able to open it since my parents weren't ready to trust me with the social security card. Fair enough imo.

Now, said social security card is missing and my birth certificate has been gone for years so to get a new ssc, I need to get a replacement birth certificate (from what I know) and some hospital records to prove that I do, indeed, exist as me, myself, and I. 

Again, I have no idea how any of this works so I'm basically relying on my parents to sort it out. I've gone onto the Social security website but everything I read just confused me more (or maybe I'm just dumb, idk). Either way there's not a Social security office in my town, and I also don't yet have a driver's license, I can't drive to the one in the town over, which is another thing I need to rely on my parents to do.

I just really want to get a job so I can start saving for things later in life, and get things I want now, and all that fun stuff, but I've been told that without my social security card/number I can't get a job either, so I'm hopelessly stuck.

The best thing I have so far is babysitting my mom's friends kids for 20$ per day I babysit (which is usually once or twice a week, sometimes three if I'm lucky), but even that I've barely been able to save anything from because I've had to get things for personal projects, covering my mom for gas money (even though she does pay me back eventually), and just getting stuff for me for basic wellbeing. 

I know I should probably be trying harder to learn about this stuff myself, but every time I ask, whoever explains it explains it in a way that gets everything all tangled up.

Setting:

I (22F) live with my parents (54F, 70M) and sister (16F) in our home. My parents have been married about 28 years, and have never been happy. They keep it together for my sister and I (regardless of how healthy it is for any of us). My dad is financially, emotionally, and verbally abusive, mostly to my mom and sometimes me. 

We're a nuclear family and don't have many friends. Dad has no friends (but 5 siblings) and mom has mostly church friends and 8 siblings (she's a religious fundie, which causes strain between her and my father because she can be extreme at times). Home life stinks, but I can't move out yet because I'm in grad school and need to be married first (American but raised with conservative Hispanic values)

Problem: 

My parents argue often about the most mundane garbage. As a child and teenager I was often involved in the arguments in hopes of mediating and achieving peace. Never could, stopped doing that recently for my health. However, my parents have no boundaries and continue to tell me about their arguments, whenever they happen, however trivial, with included bias. I've slowly been trying to assert myself and tell them to work it amongst themselves. What can they expect me to do? I tried to get them to make healthy changes and provide fair solutions until only recently, they dug their feet in the sand and never changed. I quit.

Last night my mom told me about some spat she had with my father about car insurance (he's the only driver but wants her to contribute half, she eventually caved because dad is a retiree with little money). I asked what she expected me to do or say with that information. At this point, from their lack of change or interest in my solutions, I've decided they only tell me about their arguments to turn me against the other. I don't want to hear it and implied such when I asked why she was telling me about insurance.

This morning my mom told me I should be more compassionate and let her vent. I said her venting will get her nowhere with me anymore, I've got compassion fatigue and can't offer any help. She shut down what I was saying and told me to leave her alone. 

I felt like she wasn't taking my health and happiness into consideration. I've had a long history of depression and this helplessness doesn't help me, I feel like she won't consider that.

Because of that relationship she is accusing me of being an asshole and trying to ""get to her"" by using my niece of being a proxy. 

I started suffering from an eating disorder when I was 15. I was both anorexic and bulimic. I had inpatient treatment, anti-depressants, therapy, hypnosis, you name it and nothing helped. When I was 18 (I'm 23 now) I discovered a new realm of treatment (also could be called a philosophy) called Intuitive Eating. It basically tells you to eat when you are hungry, food is food and there is never such thing as a ""good"" or ""bad"" food. For some reason this philosophy sunk in with me and I finally, finally started recovery. 

I had suspected my niece was suffering from a similar disorder for several years but this was confirmed by my mother. I emailed my niece several articles and blogs regarding Intuitive Eating. I also ordered her several books from amazon about Intuitive Eating and Body Respect by the most respected authors and scholar in the field.

44072,55348,"AITA for telling off a parent in front of others?. I run a youth club for my church with 2 others, we have a limit on amount of kids and the age, were not insured for anyone under 4, or kids over 11 who aren't leaders. 

Now said parent has 2 kids already coming, and they are so naughty, all the time and we've rung her before and said they're too bad you need to pick them up, and the response was ""no I'm in Tesco, I'll be there when the club finishes"" okay fine, so theres already problems with this parent. 

Now her 3rd child wants to come which is fair enough, and has been asking for a year, but the kids only 3, so too young. Now in November she asked and said can they come, I said no when is she 4 and was told February. Fair enough. January I ask again and am told March..... okay I might have miss heard. Fast forward to a week ago. Little one comes in and asks if she can come I ask the mother how old she is and am told 4. I ask the little girl and she says 3... mums face drops to which the brother goes ""shhh no your 4"" mum says ""well shes nearly 4... in a months time"" back and forth etc. Finally one of the other leaders say she can come today but not again until 2020. 

I'm fuming. I'm the first aider and if something went wrong it's on my head. This club would get shut down and sued, and I dont want that. So I say I'll have a word with her at the end. 

This is the AITA bit. Shes the first parent in but I wait for the other parents to arrive, then go out to speak to her and in front of the other months say loudly, how shes lied, risked my job here, and say that if anything had happened that the club would be shut down and no kids would be able to come again and lay it on THICK. all the other parents are looking and this mums face drops and she says ""oh I'm really sorry, I wont bring her again until next year"" and she scurried out

14053,17985,"AITA for getting a sex doll?. I [26m] have been dating gf [25f] for 4 years now, living together for 2. Generally, our relationship is pretty good - we rarely fight and our life together is fulfilling in all aspects except our sex life. Like most relationships, we started off having sex once a day, but that quickly tapered off. Around the 6 month mark she informed me that she does not enjoy sex that much, and would prefer it to occur around once a week. I would like it to be more frequent than this, but I respected her wishes and I generally initiate once a week. 

However, throughout our relationship she has enjoyed using her vibrators/dildos without me (yes, I have asked to use it on her and she has turned me down) 3-4x a week. I don't have a problem with this necessarily - of I course I wish she was using that energy with me, but I get that sometimes people can be in the mood for masturbating and not sex. I watch porn regularly and she doesn't like it, but hasn't explicitly asked me to stop. 

That leads us to the issue -  recently, I purchased a sex doll for my own use. It has a face, but it is clear that it is not a real human. I enjoy it more because, for me, it feels more real. However, gf freaked out and told me to get rid of it. I feel like this isn't fair to me - I spent a good chunk of money on it and its not exactly returnable, and to me it seems like its basically the same as the toys she uses. After all, she has a dildo and it certainly isn't shaped like my dick.

Am I the asshole?","NAH but I totally see her point. I would not be attracted to someone who uses a sex doll, and I quite honestly would feel hella uncomfortable if my boyfriend had one.

The most important thing I need to do now is fill out the FAFSA for financial aid since I live only with my mom and don't make a lot of money. 

The thing is, my mom doesn't know how the process for the FAFSA works, and everytime I try to explain it to her, she gets mad at me for bothering her. I understand that she works long hours basically for the entire week and I feel incredibly guilty for stressing her out even more, but she wants me to go to college, as do I, so I'm confused as to why she won't help me out. 

Because of this, I'm thinking of just going through her room and finding what I'll need. I asked my older brother to explain it to her to try and get the info from her. He did ask, but didn't succeed, resulting in him telling in me do it myself. I don't know what to do now and the pressure to get it out the way makes me stressed out.

41486,52075,"AITA for not wanting to participate in mother's day activities?. As the username on this account suggests, my mom passed away very unexpectedly about 6 years ago. I was only 15 at the time and really have not gotten over the ensuing trauma. Obviously it doesn't plague me every single day of my adult life, but certain days - like Mother's Day - are pretty excruciating. 

My dad was cool about me kind of taking it easy for the first few years, knowing it was a tough day to celebrate under my circumstances. He got into a serious relationship a little less than a year after my mom died, and has been with the same woman since, but we didn't really touch Mother's Day and I wasn't expected to figure out gifts or a card for her. Around the time that I turned 18 though, expectations changed and my dad wanted me to start doing Mother's Day with his girlfriend. 

I'm not comfortable with this. I love his girlfriend about as much as you can love your dad's eventual second wife, we have a great relationship and get along even when he's not in town. But at the end of the day, she's not my mom, Mother's Day always makes me feel awful, and I don't feel comfortable celebrating motherhood with someone who isn't my mother. It's nothing against her, it's just a bad situation. 

Last year some friends wanted to make plans with me on Mother's Day to try and keep my spirits up and take my mind off of things. I asked the girlfriend in advance if she'd be okay with it, explaining that it was nothing personal, I just still really struggle with Mother's Day. She was as cheery as usual and assured me that it was totally fine. It was apparently not fine, as she was sobbing to my dad later that night about how much my not wanting to spend Mother's Day with her upset her. Following a big lecture from my dad, I ended up just sucking it up and pushing through the day as best as possible. I kind of learned my lesson there and don't intend to try and skip out again despite my personal issues, but am I the asshole for hating having to be involved?

Edited for more info: Weve been having open communication about this for more than six months. He has been continuously masturbating instead of having sex. I am very sex positive and believe masturbating is normal and healthy. After trying a multitude of ways to improve his desire to have sex, this was brought up last week as a possible thing to try, logic being that he is releasing his sexual energy without me and so doesnt feel the need to have sex when we are together. It feels like we just had this discussion and already he is going back on his word and not trying. I do feel terribly guilty about bursting in now. This issue is making me crazy.

A few hours later I get a call from her asking if we would pay for a house-sitter since I let her down. I told her no and that it wasn’t our responsibility. She started crying and begging because she wanted to go on this trip so bad and she knows we can afford to help her out. I told her no and that she was going on this trip for free and if she couldn’t afford a house sitter for 2 days she has no business going on a vacation and hung up.

We both live in the UK -me in London as I've probably said - him just over an hour away.

I begin Monday at a new job, that pays twice the job I slaved at. The only downfall is that the job is two hours by traffic from where I live with my parents.

However, my mother/his grandma (60F) works nights so she usually sleeps during the day. Now we don't have a problem with it during the weekday but on weekends, we are having to constantly tell him to turn it down because my mother is sleeping. 

There is also the issue with our housemate (60-70ishF) who dislikes cursing. She is deeply religious but doesn't shove her faith down our throats. 

The problem asides from him waking my mother up with his yelling is that you can hear him everywhere in the house and sometimes outside. It usually doesn't stop till 9:30pm when he goes to bed but on Weekends he doesn't go to bed until 4am-5am. We have told him repeatedly to tone it down some but he doesn't listen.

My first instinct was to help my friend but then I thought “no he’s quite lazy” and told him no. My reasoning was that he had no skills or history in graphic design whatsoever and faking skills would not help. I told Gary he would be better off learning the basic editing skills himself before applying for a job.

53769,67494,"WIBTA if I (35f) decided to keep my hair that I was growing out to specifically donate?. Background info: Most of my adult life I’ve had short-ish hair. My motto was always, “It’s just hair, it’ll grow back.” My cosmetologist older sister gave me a major complex about my hair when I was younger resulting in me HATING my hair (I suffer from extreme childhood ptsd).


About 7 years ago I had a little cousin diagnosed with a rare cancer. She was 14 and afraid of loosing her hair to chemo. At the time my hair was just shy of my shoulders (the longest I ever let it get), and I promised to shave my head when she lost her hair. I did just that. Unfortunately she lost her battle after 14 months. That entire time I kept my hair short like hers. When she passed I decided to grow my hair out to donate in her memory. I’ve been growing it since and it’s half way down my back now.

Now that it’s years later and my hair is long enough to donate I’ve grown quite attached to it. Everyone knows why I decided to grow it out, though. My mom frequently asks when I’ll cut it to donate it. I’ve never been attached to my hair before because of my sister and the residual guilt is killing me.

Would I be an asshole if I kept my hair?

. Am I the asshole?",I'd say NAH. It's your hair and you can change your mind if you wanted to. Plus it wasn't like you promised to donate it specifically to someone. You can say you've decided to keep it in memory of your cousin too. Your mom was probably just curious. She would be the asshole if she guilt-tripped you about it though.,0,0,0,1,0
24420,30913,"AITA for wanting my ex-wife to put aside her anger for the sake of our kid?. My ex-wife (38) and I (42) got a divorce earlier this year. We have an amazing daughter (11) whom we adopted after her bio-mom, my ex's sister, passed away due to childbirth complications.

The reason for the divorce is entirely on me. I don't want to justify what I did, but for context, I'm an adult who has been experiencing black outs since I was a young kid, around 8 or so. I did not have a good upbringing, and they were less frequent as an adult, so I did not go to the doctor about them. Everyone I interact with says I act completely normal when I black out, so it's never been a huge issue. I'm also naturally forgetful, I'll find items in weird places I don't remember putting them, or I'll find items I don't remember purchasing.

After a sudden bad black out, I finally went to the doctor. They couldn't find anything wrong with me. I eventually went to mental health professional who, after about 5 months of meeting, gave me a DID diagnosis. This was a terrifying revelation to me. Essentially, I've been sharing a life with a complete stranger. My wife was mostly supportive, but slightly skeptical.

Anyway, due some circumstances which is a whole other story, it was revealed that I cheated on my wife during one of my black outs. I was devastated. My wife moreso. We tried to work things out, but she kept saying I was a liar and blaming my diagnosis for my infidelity. I accepted her desire for divorce. I take responsibility, I don't seek to justify my actions, even if I don't remember doing them.

Present day, we are separated. She's been making this very difficult, and has been going out of her way to talk about the situation in detail to our daughter, who has expressed how stressed being in the middle of the divorce makes her. 

I've asked my ex to stop talking about it in front of her, but she's convinced I'm a liar and wants our daughter to know how I've betrayed the family.

I'm willing to accept the shit situation, and I don't want to lie to my daughter, but AITA for thinking my ex should keep her out of it? At least until she's older, and not in the crossfire? My ex says she has a right to know, but I think it's effecting her emotional health badly.

Because of *that* we need to move some of the storage containers out of it. We don't have the room anywhere else in the house to store them. My younger sister moved nearby recently, and I asked if we could store six or seven containers in the basement of her house.

She said no, that she had no room in it. I asked why not, since it's just her, and she's really not the sentimental type. She said that she had her gym set up down there. I was confused; she invited me over for lunch and to see it. 

So, anyway, she takes me downstairs, and it's mostly wide open space. The walls were lined with shelves that had dumbbells and these weird looking things she called kettlebells. She had a boxing bag in one corner and a pull-up bar on the wall. There was some kind of foam stuff on the floor, not a yoga mat; she had one in the corner. It was like the stuff you put in a kid's playroom, except it was black instead of colored. 

I said that there's a lot of space left, I could put the stuff along that wall. She said no.

Okay so this is regarding a recent thing, it was nothing major, nothing happened, just a 2 minute debate on the current indian elections(though I have been trying to have good political discussion with my dad for years, I don't think I am able to get through)

But it was basically just someone appeased to the Muslim voter base, and I just remarked about how people get really worked up when someone appeased to Muslims when BJP has been flagrantly appeasing Hindus in the name of killing or secluding Muslims from this country, and no one has a problem.

I live together with my boyfriend. We’re both 24. He went on a business trip to Japan for two weeks. During that time, my older sister and her 4 year old son dropped by my house. I was chatting with my sister in the kitchen when my nephew was in the living room playing with his own toys. 


After a while, we checked in on him and I saw my boyfriend’s favorite stuffed animal, a very cute monkey he got in Taiwan on his 6th birthday, with one of its arms and its tail ripped off. My nephew must have went into our bedroom to take the monkey. My sister said she was so sorry and promised to sew the arm back for me and would apologize to my boyfriend when he returns from Japan.

First things first, I'm a trans boy, I discovered myself last year after questioning myself for almost 1 year and a half. My mom and dad first thought I was trans, so my mom had "" the talk "" with me. Basically she said my father thought I was acting like a boy, they thought I was bi and she said that she didn't want me to be like this.

After the talk, my dad was a little bit more respectful to me and stuff, but I couldn't stand being with him. He played psychological games for me to do what he wanted, like wearing the clothes he thought I should wear, going out when he wanted, and such. Some days ago he called me ugly again because I saw an old picture of me and said "" I look ugly on that. "" and he responded "" well, you weren't ugly, but now you are!

We’ve known about his declining condition for a while. I’ve been sad for a long time about it. My girlfriend has never once asked how I’m doing with it or if things are ok/if I want to talk.

I know it’s hard to talk about. And that it’s awkward. But her mom was in the hospital a year ago and I tried so hard to make sure she knew she could talk to me whenever. It makes me feel fucking angry and jipped on top of the grief.

9316,11806,"WIBTA for not letting my roommate’s boyfriend sleep with her in the bunk above me?. Context: I live in a suite of four people with a common room and two doubles with bunk beds. Sexy, I know. One of my suitemates has had an SO stay over (without having sex) in her bunk while her roommate (my other suitemate) slept in the same room. The latter had consented to this arrangement and there were no problems.

Previously, I had had someone stay over for a few days in the common room, and he would occasionally sleep in my bunk while I wasn’t there. All of my suitemates agreed to let him stay, and I had given them the option to say no when I asked if he could come over. I didn’t, however, ask my roommate if he could sleep in our room (but my bed). This is important.

All of this is to provide some context for the dynamics of our room. Now we get to the situation at hand: earlier tonight, my roommate asked if her boyfriend could stay the night in our room with her. She made it clear that nothing would happen while I was in the room, but to be honest, I’m not entirely comfortable with the idea of having this guy sleep above me. We don’t know each other very well. 

I am afraid though, that the precedent set in our suite (and what I owe my roommate by not even having asked if my guest could sleep in my bed) would make it such that saying no would be an asshole move. What do you think?. Am I the asshole?","I think the fact that you didn’t ask her, but are willing to say no to her when she does ask you shows a double standard. If you say no it will effectively tell her you value your own comfort much more than hers, which will potentially cause a huge rift in your cohabitation/friendship. Which would you prefer- the odd night having a guest you’d rather wasn’t there, or uncomfortable tension every night because you no longer get along with the person you share a bunk bed with?",1,1,0,0,0
471,560,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to get fat?. Me and my girlfriend were talking recently and we're both in good shape. I workout frequently and she does  2-3 times a week. But I often get into hypotheticals and today it was if either of us got fat, how would the other handle it. My side is I find someone who takes care of themselves by eating right and exercising much more attractive than someone who just lets themselves go. Though this subject feels a bit taboo and I don't want to come off as really vain, but I figured I should be able to talk about it with her.

She is very beautiful all around currently, personality and physically. Where I started to feel I may be in the wrong was when she said she wouldn't care if I got OBESE.

She also brought her son (Sean) over but the dad is not in the picture at all. Apparently she got fanatical about Buddhism and lived in the middle of nowhere so my mom decided to have Sean checked out by her doctor. The doctor said that Sean displays many symptoms of Marfan syndrome and he seriously needs to be checked out. I thought it is an extremely seriously issue and Sean needs to be tested right away and Cathy needs to know. However, she refuses to let Cathy or Sean know. She argues that they have no heath insurance and no money so even if she tried to let Cathy know, she wouldn’t have the vast amount of money to treat Sean anyway and they don’t need the extra stress right now.

I tried to tell her that it’s morally wrong to keep this from Cathy but she wouldn’t do it so I left it at that.

I have been going to therapy to cope with my worsening depression. My therapist is working with me to establish boundaries with people since I always want to help so much that it destroys myself and depletes my resources. I am failing to take care of myself.

First boundary that was top of mind was finances and how I have been sinking money into a failing business. I have credit card debt that I can't get under control. I feel hopeless. You see, my dream is pretty simple. I want to save enough money to one day retire. Difficult to do if I am constantly financing a failing business AND paying for child care. Anyway, my therapist probably did not expect this but, I try to establish boundaries and tell my girlfriend that her business needs to sustain itself, effectively cutting her off. Her first reaction was to tell me that when her business takes off, she's leaving me first chance she gets. I sort of walk away and leave it at that until the next day.

The next day, she wants to talk about it again. We get into a huge argument. I tell her to stop being selfish and to contribute something to the household. Whether it's taking the role of a stay at home mom to save on child care and maid costs or getting a job, I don't care, but pick one. I tell her that I have the worst of both worlds right now.

She starts crying, saying that I think she's worthless. I tell her I don't think you're worthless. I think you are making a conscious decision not to contribute to the household, which makes you selfish not worthless. So at the end of it all, she leaves me and takes our daughter.

36121,45460,"AITA for rescuing a stray cat off the street?. About a year and a half ago, I was hanging out at my friend's place when a kitty came to the window above his couch and started pawing at it and meowing.  I had just told my friend earlier that day that I was looking for a cat.  He walked outside, and came back in holding the cat and said ""Want it?"".

He further explained that this cat came to their house every day to get food.  It would paw at the window and meow until they put out a dish for it.  The cat was thin and bony, and clearly wasn't getting fed at home.  Him and his GF told me that the girl up the street had posted in a local FB group with a picture of the cat saying it was missing.  They took the cat in for the day and messaged her saying they have the cat.  The girl read the message but never responded.  A friend of hers commented on the post something along the lines of ""Maybe if you fed your cat and didn't throw it out the window every time it acted up, it would come home"".  I personally think that her posting this was just to save face.   The cat was outside every day, and she wanted nothing to do with it anymore.

So I took the cat.  He was food aggressive for the first couple meals I fed him.  He would literally growl if I walked close to him eating.  Over the next few months, I fattened him up, but he has remained quite feral and independent.   No more food aggression, but he would only drink water from the tap, dig through the trash, not cuddle etc.

Since then, he's warmed up to me quite a bit more.  He's always had a notch on his left ear, which I assumed was from a scrap with another cat back when he was on the streets.  But I've just learned of my local cat rescues TNR program, where they trap, neuter, and then release stray Male cats with a notch taken out of their ear for easy identification.  So this kind of just furthers my feelings that I did the right thing, given that the local cat rescue had identified him as a stray.

Last weekend, my SO (21M) and I (20F) were taken out to dinner by an older family member of his. This was at a semi-upscale chain restaurant, not Olive Garden but very similar. After looking over the menu, I decided to order a $12 personal sized pizza. Wood fired pizza is one of my favorite things ever so I wanted to try theirs. Cue snickering from my SO and his relative. Okay whatever, I expected some lighthearted teasing since they know I’m a pizza addict and his family loves to tease over silly things. A little annoying but I’m more than used to it by now.

Later that night and for the next day or so afterwards, SO’s family member kept texting him things like “(my name) should have more respect” and “if you take her out for lobster she’ll just order pizza anyway.” Apparently my choice of meal really offended them? I genuinely don’t understand why it is such a big deal though. Their and my SO’s meals were in the ballpark of $20 each so it’s not like I ordered something pricey. To me, Americanized Italian food is mostly just different combinations of cheese, meat, bread, and sauce anyway so why my choice of meal is somehow inferior to theirs baffles me.

My SO is seemingly on the fence. I feel his relative may still be giving him a hard time about the scenario days later. He tried to get me to see the relative’s side and understand why that person sees it as a respect issue but also said he just doesn’t want to see me get bullied. I replied “why should I let someone bully me about my food then? that’s a middle school attitude and (relative) is acting like a special snowflake over it.” That might have been a little harsh but this relative is someone who criticizes the younger generation and constantly tells us we’re doing things wrong (cell phone usage, job hunting, etc) yet gets their panties in a twist over something as trivial as this. SO also thinks it might reflect badly on me as being childish that I ordered pizza, but there was literally a whole section on the menu dedicated to pizzas (the regular menu, not a kids’ menu) so I figured it was fair game. I would probably even do it again.

I’m of the mind that caring so much what someone orders on the menu to the point where it affects what you think of their character (within reason, i.e. nothing more expensive or complicated than what the host and/or the rest of the table orders) is one of the most petty/trivial social constructs ever and honestly don’t feel like I did anything wrong.

Some context: I have been diagnosed with c-PTSD for the last 3.5 years, mainly stemming from abuse and neglect from my immediate family. My parents are both doctors (psychiatrist and retired ER doc), both have been aware of my diagnosis and treatment for at least that long.

Last month was my mother’s 65th birthday, the family reserved a table at a really nice restaurant and invited the immediate family as well as our respective SOs. My bf came along but no other SOs had the time to attend. Nonetheless, being with my family in a public setting makes me extremely anxious and I often have to leave to go to a private area in order to practice breathing techniques, etc. I left once about an hour in after a few drinks, was gone for 10 minutes and returned- everything was going fine and the family was reminiscing, it was actually extremely pleasant.

That is until my twin turns to me and says the exact words ‘hey do you remember when we tortured you-?’ In a joking manner. Though I am sure it was a joke, they were referring to when my family would essentially push me to clean up dog shit in an alley beside our house- the smell was so awful it would make me throw up multiple times (which I would have to clean up as well) and so on and so forth. My brain immediately shut down and I retreated to the bathroom with my bf at the table. He texted me asking if I wanted to leave and - due to the fact I was on the verge of a panic attack or something equally awful - I agreed. My father followed my bf out of the restaurant and immediately started berating me in public for not acting more respectfully, when I tried to explain to him I needed to leave he simply told me I was full of shit (he’d been doubtful of my diagnosis from the start) to which I told him to fuck off quite loudly which got the attention of nearby people. I left quickly and he retreated into the restaurant. We have been on thin ice with one another since. I apologized to my mother and she was extremely understanding, which I appreciate immensely.

I later attempted to explain to him via text but he simply demanded an apology, this man is also the psychiatrist.

He liked the job because he had time during the day to audition for acting gigs. The parents, our bosses and the kids really liked him. He got married and realized that being a camp counselor and a struggling actor wasn't going to pay the bills so he quit to take an entry-level mailroom job. People were sad to see him go. That was a year ago. 

He reached out to me to see how the kids were and he told me he's now some corporate hotshot making good money and how different it is from being a camp counselor. He keeps in contact with a couple of families through FB. It is a very small community. He asked me if he could come by for a visit because he really missed the kids. The kids would be delighted to see him. However, he's not an employee of the school or the city (which runs the after-school program) and technically he wouldn't even be allowed on campus. I am just unsure and don't want to be the one to tell him it's okay and then get in trouble.

flash forward 2 months (october) i got a f in math so i stayed after school for some help. mark was in the same room as me, though he wasn’t failing. i asked mark what was he doing in the math classroom since he didn’t need help improving his grade. he told me it was none of business. i ignored him for the next 2 hours in the math classroom.

my math teacher was done grading the homework so she kicked me and mark out of her classroom... i asked mark if he would walk home with me since the school is close to the housing unit. me and mark had a good talk as we walked home. he then did something strange.

he asked me if i was gay, i told him i was bi (foolish of me to say.) i asked him why did he ask me that and he had me shook “because i think i’m gay.” i-i- was shocked more that he was gay and dating a girl, than the fact that he’s gay. i acted like it didn’t affect me though.

i walked into my neighborhood and mark walked into his neighborhood. when i went home i ran around my room piecing  together what is happening. i was going to tell abby, but i remembered how terrible being outed is and being forced out of the closet is. i texted abby on snapchat “are you still dating mark?” “yes” she told me. i ran around my room again shocked.

no i don’t like mark i think he’s a weird person, but for him to be gay and using a girl is messed up. it’s now december almost 2020. 2 months has passed since the incident and i still don’t know if i should tell abby or if he should.

I am a mechanic at an automotive performance shop. Im going to keep this as short and simple as possible: in our shop we have a machine called a dynamometer (or dyno) which measures the horsepower a car makes by driving over it. It’s like a treadmill for cars. The car on the dyno has to be strapped down to the ground front and rear to keep it in place. 

I’ve only been working here for about 3 months, and I’ve noticed that when we happen to work late, we don’t get paid for any of the extra time we work. I am hourly (as are all the other mechanics), if I was salaried that would be a different story. 

Today we had a customer come in around 3:30 to have his car tuned on the dyno. 5 o’clock rolls around and we mechanics start getting ready to leave. Our boss is staying late to work on the car on the dyno. Before we head out, all of us (4) are in the office BS-ing when the service manager tells us that someone has to stay late to unstrap the car whenever they’re done. Everyone looks at me, because apparently it is “my turn” to stay late. I simply say “preferably someone who doesn’t have an hour long commute”. The senior tech argues back “you don’t get a pass every time just because you have an hour commute”. Everyone goes “oh I got stuff to do - I gotta go to a thing - etc”. So the service manager just looks at me and says “well I guess it’s settled then!”. Once everyone started talking again, I just quietly got up and left. 

If I was *getting paid* then sure I would stay as long as needed, I have no plans tonight. But I’m not working for free for what could be another hour or two.. Am I the asshole?",NTA.  Find a new job.  That’s grossly illegal.,0,0,0,0,1

19437,24763,"AITA for “snitching?”. I’m gonna start off with some background. I work at a smoothie place. This incident isn’t the first time C (Irresponsible Manager) has gotten in trouble for being a jackass. The first time was because she recorded two of our coworkers doing the cinnamon challenge which she suggested they do and another time she encouraged someone to drink mop water for $10. She is way too laid back, she just sits and talks to one or two employees in the kitchen area half the time she’s working.  All of the stuff she has done has almost dragged one of our other managers, B, down with her. C had been interrogating everyone including myself to figure out who told our boss about those incidents. 


Today I was working most of my shift with C, she usually works in the morning until the afternoon so she’s in charge of all of the morning preparations and tasks when we open. B works from the afternoon til closing most of the time which means she is in charge of closing everything. When some stuff doesn’t get done during opening, it makes things harder for the closing crew and vice versa. C’s slacking off puts more on B which has caused our boss to get mad at her in the past because it’s hard for her and two other people to get extra stuff from earlier that day done on top of their usual stuff.

B was due to come into work around the time everything happened. A few coworkers and C were filling up rubber gloves with water and throwing them out the front door onto the ground. I believe B getting in trouble for C’s slacking off isn’t fair and I don’t want B getting fired, so I texted her and gave her a heads up on what was going on so she could keep everyone in check when she came in. She wanted me to tell our boss but I was afraid of the backlash it’d cause because C always talks about how everyone likes her because she’s “fun.” I let B tell our boss herself though if she wanted to. C got a call on the store phone from our boss asking if everything was ok and then telling C she knows what happened today.

As soon as C got off the phone, she said “PycoDesi has been exposed, she’s a snitch.” to everyone. B came into work shortly after and C was getting pissy with me and said “PycoDesi if you have a problem with me just tell me.” Id like to point out that I’ve never been rude to her in any way in the months I’ve worked with her. 

C’s been written up in the past so she might get fired but she has another job and constantly talks shit about this one so it shouldn’t be a big deal. Also sorry if the formatting and order of things is a mess.

57654,72412,"AITA for scolding the receptionist at my dental clinic for their inefficiency?. My relationship with the receptionists at the dental clinic where I had my braces has been very tense. 

Allow me to set the scene: Back then when I had braces, I’d book an appointment at 3pm but I’ll be told to wait it out until 5pm. Each time I try to go on time, I’ll always be left waiting. I tried to outsmart them and go slightly later, but I’ll still be told to wait. Over the course of two years, there have been numerous occasions when I went up to them and threatened to leave because I felt extremely pissed that my time isn’t respected. 

I believe at the beginning, it was an unintentional mistake of theirs for the appointment timing to be inaccurate but because of my harsh tone towards them, they took offence and I straight up went into their ‘blacklist’ and they started doing this on purpose. Fine, I took it into stride, tolerated for two years since my dad has already paid everything and it would just cost more money to go to another specialist. 

Finally, my braces was gone. I wanted nothing to do with that clinic anymore. I never went there anymore until 6 months ago, I lost my retainers and I needed a replacement. I didn’t want to find a new dentist because the orthodontist that did my braces had the most accurate mould of my teeth, since it was taken right after I got my wires off. I’m putting myself at risk of having a slightly misaligned teeth if I were to get a new mould from another dentist since my teeth was unstable and very prone to shifting. So I asked them if they could get me a replacement and I needed it by the next day because I’m worried my teeth would shift too far apart and it would feel painful and sore. I informed them early in the morning so it was more than enough time. The receptionist claimed that they are unable to, and can only give it to me 3 days later. I highly suspected they tried to make things difficult for me, and only when I threatened to make things big and post a negative review online, they obliged and the next day, I was able to collect my retainers.

60212,75573,"AITA if I don't want my nephew to have and old belonging of mine?. Disclaimer: English is my second language so sorry if I screw up

I'm a 19 y/o girl and my nephew is 4.

When I was 7 my mom got me a Spider-man thermos, for hot beverages so I could bring something warm  to school. I love Spider-man to this day and I still have the thermos but I don't use ut anymore. I fell in love with that thermos and made me really happy.

When I was like 11 I made a fish tank with a shoe bow, with colored fishies hanging with strings; this fish tank is important for later

Now my nephew started liking Marvel and one of his favorites is Spider-man. My mother tought it would be a good idea to give my nephew the thermos to have a drink. She could've used a normal cup but didn't, idk why. Anyway

I told her to not give him the cup because is something special from my childhood. My childhood wasn't that bad, but I don't have too many happy memories. One of those happy memories was that thermos and even if I don't use it has sentimental value to me. She didn't care and got mad at me almost yelling at me that ""well if you don't want anybody to use it then store it in your room"".

Now the fishtank part

Once my older brother (not my nephew's dad, his uncle) and my nephew were playing in our house and my nephew saw the fishtank and wanted it. And my brother handed him the fishtank. My mother got mad with him because the fishtank is special to her because I did it and doesn't want my nephew to have it. 

If you don't see it, the thing is she gives him stuff she doesn't care about and its special to other people (like the thermos and I) but if its special to HER she doesn't want him near it. 

She buys him stuff all the time so I don't know why she hasn't bought a Spider-man thermos to him.
Not jealous if you're wondering, but I don't him this fair. Btw the fishtank was just somewhere in other room, not her bedroom. 

If she wanted to anyone not touching it then she should ""have it in her room"", but no!

Sorry if it's too long I just not sure what to do or even feel because ""I'm older and I look bad because he's little""

I think she has a point with the keep it in your room thing. If the thermos is stored with the rest of your dishes, you should probably expect other people to use it IMO.

However, there is no need for her to yell about you politely asking her not to use it, and especially no need to yell about a child’s curiosity about the tank. You are right, if she doesn’t want people touching it it should also be in her room.",0,0,0,0,1

5569,7133,"AITA for being pissed off about this person at work?. OK, another work situation with a girl I'll call M. 

  I work on the customer service desk with M, and the rule is that if you can't do a shift, for whatever reason, you should attempt to sort it out yourself and get a shift swapped with someone else, which my line manager is usually pretty much fine with (saves them the hassle of changing rotas). 

Now something I should mention is that usually three weeks worth of shift timetables are available. These are pinned up in the managers office, the staff office and there's a copy behind the CSD. Anyone who wants to check their shifts (or needs to) can go and consult any of these copies at any time. 
  
A few weeks ago, M asked me on a Friday afternoon if I could cover a Saturday shift, to which I said no. I found it totally unreasonable that I was being expected to cover a shift with less than 12 hours notice, and I wasn't particularly happy that her 'reason' for wanting that day off was 'because I promised my little girl we'd go shopping'. To me, the shift timetable had been up for long enough that if it had been that important, she would have spoken to the line manager and asked not to be put in a shift that day (which is entirely possible, I've done it). I told her this in a polite fashion and advised her gently that if she had availability issues, she needed to go to a manager and actually tell them. 

  Skip forward to last two days ago and she seems to be pulling the same thing again. I'm now covering her shift today for what appears to be similar reasons, and I'm not happy as this was supposed to be the start of 4 days of holiday for me. 

Now fair enough, things like childcare are an issue, and I can understand if some genuine reason to do with the kids or whatever is an issue, but to me the whole thing looks like she's using this as a trump card, and I'm being expected to give into every demand. magically virtually every other person with children in the store seems to cope just fine.

My husband and I are starting to plan our estate. We do not have children but have a number of nieces and nephews, four from my side of the family and ten from my husband’s. We have great relationships with all of them. 

My husband and I have a significant amount of assets, most of which my husband inherited from his parents or were bought using income from the business that my husband’s parents left us (We both worked in the business until we sold it recently to retire).  I would like for our assets to be divided equally among our nieces and nephews when we’re gone, but I’m wondering if I would be an asshole to do that since those assets are mostly from my husband’s side of the family.

38207,48031,"WIBTA If I asked my mother to leave her recently disabled boyfriend?. Some context:

My mother divorced my POS alcoholic father about 6 years ago, at age 55. This had a huge impact of her as she now faced growing old alone. I could tell this weighed heavy on her, but she is a positive woman and pulled through making the best she could, spending a lot of time with friends etc.

Fast forward to three years ago, she meets a great man. He treated her well, did not drink, and was general a good man. My brother and I were naturally cautious about who dated our mother, and after a few issues that are not particularly relevant, my brother was not willing to give his blessing. They broke up, which was rough for my mom, but after a while they gravitated back to each other, and it seemed like they were really in love. At this point, we just decided to support and be happy for her so we all accepted him. This was about a year after they met.

Fast forward again, he flies in to basically move in with her. My mom was glowing, they had a wonderful night with friends and went to have a romantic night at home. The next morning, he wakes up before her, and says “I’m gonna make you breakfast!” And sets out on his motorbike. He does not wear his helmet. You know where this is going... he has a horrific accident. His head is split open, he sustains major brain damage. He is in a coma for months. And when he finally wakes up, well... he is not who he used to be. He teetered on the edge of death for months, and my mom was by his side the whole time. He was flown back to the UK where he spent most of his recovery, with his family. 

A few weeks ago, my mom went to visit him and brought him back to spend a few months with her, and I am also visiting her right now. I see that he requires constant help, he barely remembers her, her barely remembers *anything*. He has almost no cognitive function, and he requires almost constant attention. He is just not there anymore, he is like a small child, and I worry for my mother having to care for this poor man for the remainder of her well earned old age, I want her to be happy and care free and be taken care of, and the man she once  fell for is simply not there anymore.

We bumped into each other at an event randomly and got along amazingly well. This started our great relationship that lasted almost exactly one year. When this relationship starts I let her know that it would end when I graduated (new phase in life, etc.), she’s cool with it. Now we were both very introverted (Mary far more than I was), but throughout the year I began to realize that I was growing quite a bit as a person and learned that I really enjoy being more outgoing. As I’m growing I also realize that I hate being so uncomfortable when talking to new people.

A year rolls by and the same event rolls around so I go again. I end up meeting a girl and having so much fun (laughing, joking, not being afraid to be dumb) that I realize I craved this in my relationship. Mary's introverted nature really got in the way of that because when I was with her I tended to be more introverted as well. I immediately bring this up with Mary as an observation and she decides we should talk about our relationship.

Here's the bit where I feel like an asshole. During the conversation, Mary brings up the fact that she's pretty young and has plenty of room to grow herself and she really wants this to work out.

My mom texts me and tells me that the offer was brought up and the family member was overjoyed. Apparently my younger sister (who is back home and doesn’t have these medical issues) had also made an offer. After discussing it with my mom, we agree that it would make more sense for my sister donate since she’s healthier, and lives closer to the family member and thus can attend the necessary dr appointments.

Well now, my sister throws it in my face that I took back that offer and when it upset me, she made sure to say she didn’t feel bad for saying what she did.

If she hadn’t offered her eggs, I would’ve discussed with the family member my issues and let them make the decision if it was worth it. I would’ve stuck by my word, but just made sure they knew what could possibly pass on. I also would’ve either made the trips, or waited til summer when I was able to be with them at the doctor all the time.

But even knowing this I feel like an asshole. I feel guilty and ashamed. AITA?. Am I the asshole?","NTA

A hypothetical offer of eggs made a few years ago to a third party is not a firm offer made in current circumstances to the person who needs the eggs. Your previous possible willingness, if it was brought up at all without you there, should have been presented as a possibility to follow up, not as something you'd promised last week. They did not have the right to commit you to that hypothetical willingness.

Even if you did make an actual offer years ago, it's now. You can change your mind for many reasons. Yes, that change might upset people, but it's your right to decide whether and to whom you donate eggs.",0,0,0,0,1
28339,35804,"AITA for warning my friend not to date a guy who broke my heart?. Hi folks, I understand my actions were inflammatory but I feel some time of way about this situation. 

So I 21M went on a tinder date with this really awesome dude. We had an amazing night and everything spoke to him having a great time. Cue me getting really hopeful about dating him yadda yadda yadda. We went back to my place and watched a movie and started getting intimate. Before we went any farther than making out, I told him I wasn’t interested in a one night stand and that if he wasn’t interested in going out again, it’d be best if he left. 

He said he was having a great time and  “probably” wants to go out again. I asked what that meant and he said “oh I mean, yeah I do. I dunno why I said probably”. 

Anyways we slept together. 

The next day I drive him home and he says he’ll see me soon schedules permitting. I follow up a couple days later to no response. Then again a couple more days later. 

He responds with this long message about how he likes me but isn’t ready for a relationship. I was kinda pissed but whatever, I was civil and thanked him for the date and wished him well. 

The next week my friend (a girl, the dude is bi) goes on a date with him off tinder unbeknownst to me. She tells me about it the next day and I tell her my story and how, based on what I saw and how I felt, that he wasn’t a great guy. 

She let him know that I told her that and ended things. 

The next day, I get a string of messages from him cursing me for interfering, how he thinks she’s the one, how I ruined their shot at a relation because of jealousy etc. 

Honestly, IMO, he kinda played me and I wanted to look out for my friend. Also there was a tiny glimmer of shadenfreud when I heard what happened. My friend feels no type of way about him because she has tons of options and is an amazing person.

&#x200B;

A couple of years ago, I left someone who was extremely abusive, in every way except physically. He never hit me, but he screamed in my face, called me every name under the sun, threw and broke things when he was mad. He ripped the closet door off its track once because when I did his laundry, I didn't spot a couple of work shirts that he'd kicked under the bed. Then he gave me the silent treatment for a full day because I didn't want to have sex while terrified. 

&#x200B;

I've known two of my closest friends for a long time - they became my friends a few years before I left my ex. They have full knowledge of how abusive he was, and they have many of the details of that abuse. About a year before I left him, one of them held my hand and comforted me when I was afraid to go home.

Yesterday, one of these friends said ""hey, we're having a party this weekend, and you're welcome to come, just know that your ex has already said he'll be there.""

I don't want to tell anyone who they're ""allowed"" to hang out with. That would definitely make me the asshole.

It can be considered insulting to a chef, to add salt or pepper to a dish, without tasting it first.  How could you possibly know it needs seasoning without trying it first?

Similar idea with trying the vegetarian chili.

You weren't trying the vegetarian chili, you made your own concoction with the vegetarian chili as an ingredient.

One possible reason she could have taken offence, would be: you aren't giving vegetarian food a chance, if you have to add meat to it, before you give it a try.

It is one thing to say - ""Hey that looks good, can I try some?"" Try it, and find it less appetizing than you expected - then fix it.

I did post about the relationship aspect of this in r/relationships, but things have quickly continued to get worse and I’m genuinely concerned for the guy. 

My friend developed strong feelings for my girlfriend, and expressed them to me that he wanted to date her. I obviously told him that wasn’t going to happen, but he was very drunk when he said this to me. His drinking has been getting bad over the last year. When he sobered up, he didn’t take back anything he said, so my girlfriend and I chose to cut ties with him. I’ve been staying with her while we pack to move to our new apartment. Friend made getting the rest of my things from our apartment difficult and made a lot of horrible comments about my girlfriend, calling her terrible names and saying she deserved abuse from her previous relationship. He was also very drunk at that time.

My gf and I both blocked his number, but he has been reaching out to mutual friends to try to get the address of our new apartment. They have been ignoring him too, and some have blocked him, but he’s not stopping. He went to my girlfriends place of work the other day (she is a nanny, so works in the family’s home) to “talk things out” with her, and left when she asked him to, but it did lead to her getting fired, since the parents don’t want to risk him showing up again. She has worked for them for almost 2 years and understands but is devastated. 

This leads me to my question. Friend clearly needs help that I cannot (and at this point will not) provide. I know in the past he has mentioned his mom being very overbearing/overprotective growing up, so I believe if I contacted her on Facebook, she would be very proactive in finding help for him. My girlfriend feels that me contacting friends mom would be more of a revenge act because he’s made our lives hell for a few weeks now, he needs to get help on his own, and we need to distance ourselves completely from him. I feel like he needs help for drinking and possible mental illness, and even if I can’t be friends with him anymore, I want to get help for him.

She says “well I didn’t expect her to take so long time is money when you work don’t you get paid for it”

I say “once again I don’t understand why that is my problem or issue you picked the price I did not if she takes one hour or six hours it has nothing to do with me”

Yesterday, my brother contacted me to ask if we could video chat together, along with my parents, to open our presents for each other because every one would be too busy to open each others presents on Christmas day. I agreed, and we proceeded to video chat together.

My parents open their presents, and were very happy with what my brother, his gf, my bf and I got them. We were glad because we spent a lot of time figuring out the perfect thing to get them. Before I knew  it, it's my turn, and my brother was eager to watch me open my present. I ask my boyfriend to hold my phone for me as I rip the wrapping paper and see my gift: a chromebook laptop!

Here's where I need to back up and explain some details that occurred prior to this event. About a month ago, I bought myself a computer for a very good price. I told my family about it, and soon after my brother contacted me and we talked about the computer I got. He asked me how it was working, and I told him it was working very well, and was happy I got for a great deal. 

Back to yesterday, my brother and his gf were watching me opening the laptop they gave me, and I really didn't know how to react. I guess my initial reaction was utter confusion, but as soon as I heard my brother say ""what do you think?"" I snapped back to reality, and said ""It's great! Thank you guys so much, you really didn't have to do that, but I appreciate it!"" And that's true, I do appreciate the thought he put into my gift. After we hung up I felt awful, however. I felt mad at myself for not liking the gift only for the fact that I didn't need a computer, and he should have known that because we talked about it. I decided to give the chromebook to my bfs little sister, whose in college and doesn't have a laptop. I wonder if I should have called him afterwards and been honest, but I just didn't want him to think he had to go out and get me something else.


So, AITA? Should I have not given it to my bf's sister, and instead called my brother and told him the truth, or should I keep my lie to spare my brother's feelings? 

Thank you for reading this, and I hope y'all have a happy holiday season!. Am I the asshole?","NAH; it’s not a personal gift by any means, so I don’t see anything wrong with giving it to your bf’s sister. That’s probably the best way to make use of it.

Your brother isn’t in the wrong either here; maybe he thought you could use an additional device. No need to feel guilty or let him know what you did with the gift.",0,0,0,1,0
60691,76167,"AITA for asking the people next to me to be quiet during a movie. So I went to see Star Wars this afternoon. I've started going to the movies by myself recently, and I've thoroughly enjoyed doing so. I can roll up right when the movie is starting. There's no expectation for awkward chit chat before the movie. It's great.

I sat in my assigned seat next to what appeared to be an older woman and her adult son. They were talking quite loudly during the trailers, but I thought *who cares it's just the trailers.* But then the Lucasfilm logo came up and they're still talking. Innocuous stuff like ""I remember seeing the originals in theaters"" and ""Mom, only us boys saw Star Wars in theaters"" etc. They talk through the entire crawl. Then they continue talking during the opening scene. She's asking questions. He's just talking about whatever.

So I lean over and say ""Please stop talking."" She passes the message along to her son who leans over at me very angrily and says ""But I have a lot to say"" and then ""That's fucking rude."" I lean back and ignore them, even though she was playing candy crush for the rest of the movie.

I think I'm in the right here, but I'm wondering if it would have been better to get a manager or something.

AITA?. Am I the asshole?",NTA. Next time get the manager and if they don’t shut up they’ll be asked to leave. Talking during movies is so fucking rude. Sorry you had to go through that.,0,0,0,0,1
11338,14505,"AITA for asking my guests to sit down when they use my toilet to pee?. I'm a very clean guy, and I don't always do this myself, but I take care to have good aim when I'm standing up to pee. Any drops left over I'll wipe away with a few squares of toilet paper, especially when I'm at a guest's house.

My landlord hosts a regular ""guy's night"" every Sunday, and I've become good friends with the guys that come over. Unfortunately, my bathroom doubles as the guest bathroom, and I find myself cleaning substantial quantities of urine that's dripped down the sides of the bowl onto the floor or pooled on the back rim, which I don't think it's necessary or polite to make a host do this.

I half-jokingly, half-seriously suggested that the guys should use the toilet sitting down, and they became noticeably uncomfortable and upset, and the mood of the get-together was tangibly ruined. They made a few jokes about it, but I found out later from my landlord that the guys said they were offended and didn't want to use the bathroom anymore. That wasn't my intent, I thought since I knew them well enough I could make a suggestion and not have it viewed as an insult. Am I the asshole in this situation?. Am I the asshole?","NAH

I told my wife this is an issue that is not only gross but it's a hygiene issue. I told her to pick it off the floor and throw it away and she just puts it on top of the trash for all to look at it when you open the lid. She says I have no basis and I just 'want to pick a fight with her' and I believe it takes minimal effort to discard her used pads/tampons without me ever having to see it.

56386,70836,"AITA for avoiding celebrating my birthday with my significant other?. I had my birthday a few days ago but didn't really ""celebrate"" it. Personally I feel very egotistical to even bring it up to people and don't like celebrating it. Basically let the missus know I was handling dinner for myself, grabbed a feed from KFC and picked up a new beer to try. Biggest celebration I've pulled for myself in a few years and avoided bringing anyone into it.

The next day things clicked for the missus and she gave me an earful. Apparently I'm selfish, don't see the bigger picture and don't consider her feelings on the issue. I just said that she's playing silly buggers and fabricating problems where there are none. After that interaction I also copped an earful from her mum over a call.

Thee missus loves birthdays and events and things. She gets into the whole celebration mood, does things for her parents, siblings and friends. When it's her birthday I'll get her a gift, wrap it nicely and organise something nice. I do that because that's what she enjoys. Over the years I've semi-dodged my birthday where often she forgets the exact date and half the time and life gets in the way of remembering. I don't put it on social media, I don't write it in calendars/diaries and if asked I just say late August. When she does remember, it's a whole thing with dinner at her parents, drinks with people, cakes and bullshit effort that's honestly wasted on a non-event about me ageing.

32929,41572,"AITA for being upset toward my girlfriend after seeing a sexual picture of her and her ex?. I’ll keep this as short as possible. The last 3 days have been some of the worse in my life. On thursday a car crossed the yellow line attempting to go to another road (without looking) and hit me head on. I had no time to react. My car is totaled and I walked away with only a concussion/couple scrapes and bruises. I have been pretty much awake since then because of the emotional trauma i suffered. I am grateful that i walked away. (have pictures if anyone is interested in that). Anyways, my girlfriend has been super supportive and amazing through all of this. Today she told me some kid from her high school had messaged her and said “Hey your ex is John Doe right?” “he sent me these pictures” and proceeded to send the pics. I figured it was just going to be nude pics. My girlfriend and I obviously have past experience and a nude to an ex boyfriend that got leaked is entirely and absolutely not her fault. What he sent was 2 nudes of her and a picture of her sucking her ex boyfriends dick. I felt sick to my stomach. The kid then blocked her and she called her ex. He of course denied sending any pictures. She was crying and said I was “acting weird” I told her straight up that I felt bad about the situation and how it’s terrible that someone is spreading her pictures. I also told her that it fucked me up a little bit and i’d never want to see something like that. I told her it wasn’t her fault but i couldn’t help but feel upset. It’s one thing to be aware of someone’s past (no big deal in my book) but seeing first hand a picture of her sucking another guys penis wasn’t exactly flattering.

Plus the annoying comments like “you should go to day shift with the rest of the vegans,” “non-vegans sit over here.” It’s not genuine interest and I got sick of it. 

I said to “stop asking about my diet, because no one else is getting questioned about what’s on their plate and it’s very annoying. I’m an adult and will eat when I want to eat and what I want to eat. Jesus Christ!” 

Am I being unreasonable? I would have been okay with questions. Those 2 annoying comments really ticked me off, because it was unnecessary and I felt singled out for no good reason.

42352,53165,"AITA for not offering to take the dog out?. Ok I know this is really not a big deal compared to other posts on here, but I have mixed feelings about this.

So last week, my mom was out running errands I think (I really don’t exactly remember everything, I don’t even remember what I ate for breakfast this morning) but anyway, she was busy with something. We had lots of dishes from dinner, and my brother and I cleaned every single thing up. My parents never touched any of the dishes.

And so then I went to my room after cleaning up as usual. Nothing else happens that night. It’s just a normal night.

Ok and then the next morning, my mom tells me  I should be less selfish. I asked her why she thought I was selfish and she said, “well, I was busy last night, and it would’ve been nice if you to offer to take the dog out.”

And I was just confused, like what? You can’t be mad at me for not offering to if you never even told me you wanted me to do that. Also, that’s not a responsibility I normally have to do, so it’s not engrained in me that it’s something I should be expected to do. So that just hit me as a huge surprise

I’m selfish for not offering to take out the dog? Ok I’m sorry, but if you want me to do something for you, you ask me, not call me selfish the next day because I didn’t do something you never asked me to do or even HINTED at?

55360,69534,"AITA for not wanting my fiance to go out the other night?. So my fiance (M39) and I (F37) each have 3 kids in the house. We both share custody with the other parent. My kids are 13, 11 and 8. His kids are 11, 8 and 5. Friday we picked up all six for the weekend. We both had rough days Friday, and both were stressed out. At 9 Friday night he tells me he has to leave. I ask where to (lately he's been selling things on fb marketplace so I didn't know if it had to do with that). He says to go hang with his friend. I explain to him that it's not fair of him to just leave me with all six kids, by myself, while he goes out, and that I feel like he should wait until a kid free day. He tells me he will wait until they're in bed in an hour, and I tell him that's not the point. So after some discussion, he stays home. 
Just now we were talking about it, and his point is that it's easy to take care of them, especially when they're asleep, and he needed to get out. I tell him it isn't about whether it's easy or hard, it's that is unfair to leave me home and that I would like the courtesy of him at least asking me if I'm okay with it and not just assuming that I will be, and that I would never go out to have fun and leave him home with all six kids by himself. That the nights we have them we shouldn't be out drinking and hanging out, that people can come here or we can suggest waiting until a day when the kids aren't here. He thinks I'm being unfair because he doesn't often try to get out of the house, I think he should compromise and do it on a day the kids aren't here, because we have plenty of kid free days. I also don't think it's unreasonable to expect him to ask me if I'm okay with it, maybe explain why he needs it that day, and not just spring it on me. We aren't arguing about this, it's just a discussion we are having that we can't seem to agree on. I get where he is coming from. I told him I will never tell him not to go out with his friends, that I only ask that he do it on nights we don't have his kids, because I'm his fiance, not his live in babysitter.

50397,63226,"AITA for refusing to move my car when it was blocking someone in?. At work, we have a car park which is shared by a couple of different organisations who work in the same building. You have to have an electronic pass to get in, which is linked to your work ID, and each organisation has a few numbered spots that are assigned to them. 

My employer’s spots are in a line going up to a corner, and the corner spot is a square for motorcycle parking only. Then there is another line of normal parking spaces at a right-angle. 

When I arrived today the corner spot for motorcycles only had a small car parked in it. The only spot left of the ones I am allowed to use was next to it, and by parking in it I blocked in the car in the motorcycle area. There was still a gap but not big enough to get the car out through. 

When I parked I figured a) if someone decides to park there, I’m going to assume they don’t expect to get their car out before the end of the working day and b) I’ve a pass and a space assigned to job, I’m entitled to park in that space. 

Anyway part way through the morning the porter for our building came up to our floor and found me in a meeting with my manager. They explained the person parked in the motorcycle spot wanted to leave but couldn’t get out and could I please move my car? I said no, I was in a meeting and parked where I was meant to park, but I’d be leaving in about an hour so they could get out then. The porter was a bit grumbly but accepted this and left. 

I was sort of grumpy this morning and on reflection am not sure if I was an asshole for refusing to move? I *was* in a meeting and we had stuff to get done, moving the car would’ve delayed finishing that stuff and ultimately made me late for my next appointments, but only by 10 minutes and I basically only said no out of a self-righteous feeling of ‘why should I?’ when I’m not the idiot who parked somewhere I shouldn’t have.

16724,21283,"AITA for not getting something off the printer for my coworker?. **Backstory:** I work as a program assistant for a small non-profit program. It's treated like an assistant manager position and my boss treats me as an equal, especially after I covered her maternity leave last year. 

We had a new hire start this past January and I've had a couple issues with her in the past where she thinks she can micromanage me. She is pretty domineering yet she has no clout in this agency. But as always, everyone always panders to the domineering one.

The issue is, that I have trouble being assertive. It's a weakness on my part and I'm working on it on therapy. I recognize my coworkers have taken advantage of me since I worked here, bu I'm trying to move past it.

Today, this particular coworker, without asking anyone decided to set up shop in the annex building's conference room (We're less than a block from the main building). Her boss called my boss looking for her because she's not supposed to be doing this. She has been told no several times before, yet she still does it.

My boss is in the conference room telling the co-worker to pack up to listen to the co-worker whining because she didn't want to go to the main building to work. (Her rationale is that her office mate has clients, which is understandable but her boss has offered her other solutions. She refuses to listen to them).

When I walked in the conference room, my co-worker demanded me to get her papers off the printer. I told her ""no, it's not my job,"" where she proceeded to yell at me because I said no, telling me I don't want to mess with her. She also threw in ""I'm not being disrespectful, but next time I will be.""

I was fighting tears at this point, as aforementioned, assertiveness is not my strong point. But I managed to get out ""Okay, you don't have to yell at me for this."" And I walked to the bathroom to calm down.

When I calmed down and went to the bathroom, there's my boss being a pushover to this woman, looking for the papers on the printer, which my coworker never printed. It made me feel like the asshole slightly because my boss makes me look ""mean"" for asserting myself.

I don't feel like walking to the printer back and forth, especially when I have a physical disability that everyone here vaguely knows about. I've been in a flare the last few days. But  I don't feel like I should need to defend it in a situation that's not relevant to my job description.

My partner [30M] and I [F29] have been married in a monogamous relationship for a few years now, and we had our first child this year. I’ve alway had a much lower sex drive, but between recovering from childbirth, postpartum hormones, self-esteem issues with my new body, and the stress of parenthood, it’s basically zilch. My husband’s, on the other hand, has not decreased.

Our marriage has been a little bumpy since having a baby, but we’ve been in couple’s therapy for a few months and it has helped a lot. I have zero interest in sex 9 out of 10 days, but I’m working hard on just establishing other activities that involve us being physical without necessarily having sex, like cuddling/being physically close/mutual masturbation, etc. It’s helped a lot.

This week, we were cuddling after a dry spell of almost two weeks and started naughty whispering. He then asked me to tell him one of my fantasies, and drawing a blank because I’ve been so disinterested in sex, I asked him to go first.  He mentioned wanting to tie me up and blindfold me (this is all fine) while having sex with another woman (this... not so much). 

Our boundaries are such that we accept the other is human and finds other people attractive and all have our own fantasies (which again, fine), but this is something that was actually really upsetting to hear, especially with my self esteems issues lately. I immediately burst into tears—i really didn’t want to, because I feel like I made him feel bad for being vulnerable about something like a personal fantasy, but I’m honestly really hurt.

49005,61497,"AITA for taking married men as clients as a sex worker?. I do independent meetups for sex and recently got into an argument online as to whether it is wrong for me to take on married men as clients. It is legal to do what I do where I live, so that's not an issue. 

My point of view is that I don't initiate contact, I barely advertise and they message first. In no way am I convincing anyone to cheat who wouldn't otherwise, they have to seek it out. If I were to refuse them, they'd just find someone else, I'm far from the only worker in my area. I would guess that around 30% of people I see are married, maybe more are in relationships outside marriage and maybe more are married but don't let me know. 

I could get by without seeing these clients but it would be a hit to my income. I'm not doing this work to survive but it is my main income, refusing to see anyone who says they're married would affect my life a lot. 

His argument was that it's morally wrong to enable cheaters and I do agree to an extent. I think cheating is wrong and disgusting but at the same time I don't see it as my place to prevent it. Both clients and I look to keep what we do quiet, and so if word got out that I was telling clients partners about them I'd lose a lot of potential clients, even those not in relationships who still want to keep it quiet. 

In all honesty I have no intention of changing what I do, but I will keep an open mind to the replies as much as I can. Also I do not take clients from this account, so please do not try to book.

I think I'm an asshole in the way that I handle a lot of things. I will yell back, argue and if someone hits me, I will hit back hard. I'm not an easy person to live with for my family, I'm autistic and this means that I have sensory issues. I can't handle loud sudden noises or heavy breathing that well. I have memory issues and forget things nearly instantly. I get frequent panic attacks and I ignore everyone when I'm in those. I usually spend most of my day gaming and trying to avoid people. I have problems that mean that I don't have feelings that are strongly positive. I can get ones that are strongly negative in certain situations but strongly positive ones? They are not something that I get a lot of (that part is probably my fault, I did try and stop feeling any emotions at all at one point in time so that I could try and make everyone else happy).

 My sibling has been bullying me for years, they make me feel depressed and anxious when I'm near them. My mum doesn't seem to give a damn about that. She wants us to be be best friends. She thinks that our arguments are just ""sibling rivalry"". It is not sibling rivalry. Me and sibling have tried to be ""friends"". That didn't work out. I don't even want to TRY to be friends with sibling due to how they make me feel on an everyday basis. My family think that I'm an asshole for not wanting to be friends with sibling.

My neighbor has 3 raised gardens along our fence line. They planted pumpkins and watermelons amongst other things. The vines from these plants are all along the fence, which look pretty cool, but the vines recently started wrapping themselves around my bushes and up into a tree!


I tried pulling the vines out, but there were tendrils out from the thicker pieces holding onto other pieces of the branches. IMO, the vines were taking over my bushes and soon to be tree.  So, I cut the vines in the tree and bushes. 


My neighbor came over with her daughter (it's apparently the teenagers garden) literally shaking in anger wanting to know why I did what I did stating i made her kid cry. I apologized and said the vines were choking off my trees and bushes so I cut the vines in them. I said nothing was done maliciously and I again apologized. She continued berating me stating we needed to keep lines of communication open and destroying their plants was not acceptable.  I then looked at the kid and said I'm very sorry, no harm was meant.  


Mom grabbed the kid and marched home.

I will try to break it down the best I can. 4 years ago when I started college, I adopted a long hair tortoishell cat. My parents of course were very reluctant at first but only allowed it because I agreed to take care of her and cover all costs. Now like all parents, they became very close to kitty and and love her to death. Only problem is they are always working and dont really like the idea of feeding and cleaning cat litter. In their home country they just let cats roam around and let them catch their own food. My mom will let the car out in the backyard and watch her while shes gardening. Letting her sniff the grass and whatever. Sometimes my mom will get too into her gardening and the cat will hop the fence and chill around our neighbours but will always return after an hour or so.

13292,17024,"AITA for asking my wife to clean the house?. A little back story... our house is pretty bad messy, like embarrassingly messy. I work everyday except Tuesday, and Sunday from 9-7:30pm. My day is consumed by work. 

I have 3 kids, and my wife is a stay at home mom. All of my kids are in school, so they are gone 8-4pm everyday. Only person home between those hours is my wife, as she doesn’t work. 

I usually stay pretty quiet about things, but every now and then, I ask her things like “you gonna clean the house today?” , and she flips out every time, saying things like she takes care of the kids, and runs all the time. AFAIK running involves paying some bills, and grocery shopping. That can’t be everyday, and can she even use the excuse taking care of the kids, when they are at school the majority of the day? 

Just so I do not run the risk of being completely one sided, I am not the most tidy person, and she says things like “you should pick up your mess, and maybe I’ll clean”. I don’t know, I could clean more, and I do not feel it is her sole job in life to be the “maid”.

So a little backstory first, I’ve (23f)always lived with my bio dad because I never got along with my bio mom. We barely had a relationship at all actually. (She was/is on drugs my whole life) As a teenager, I was in a very abusive relationship that I decided to get out of. My bio dad and ex knew each other but weren’t close until I left him. When my dad found out that We broke up, he kicked me out and let my ex move in with him. They became friends and did everything together. I was 15 or 16 at the time, homeless, with nowhere to go so I called my mom. (Only after realizing that no one would rent to a minor) it was literally a last resort. She and her bf at the time let me move in with them. I became very close with her boyfriend through the years and I consider him my dad. 

Fast forward to now, 5 years later, my mom wants a divorce. I mentioned to my sister, that I still wanted stepdad in my life. (Him and her were never close because she lived with my aunt across the country) she said that I was acting just like my bio dad. When I asked why she thinks that, she brought up how he still hangs out with my ex even though we’re not together.

I wasn't thrilled that she did this, but I could tell she was very excited and she went to some trouble so I didn't make an issue of it. I accepted, and joked, ""I guess I get to plan my dream wedding, since you proposed.""

I walked into the laundromat at my law college after my clothes finished in the washer and saw that all of the dryers were full. I sat around for ten minutes waiting for two of the dryers to finish drying. About a minute after they had, I got up, took the clothes that had dried out and set them on the table, making sure to keep them in two separate piles with plenty of distance between them, and then put my clothes in to be dried.

A. I have no fucking idea how long he might take to show up. What should I do, waste five to ten minutes sitting around waiting for a guy that might not show for twenty?

B. While I did happen to be there early enough to see when the dryer stopped, HE didn't know that.

I had just stepped on to the train and pretty much that moment, the doors had begun to beep as they were about to close. As you would expect, I didn't pay much attention to this. 

Just then, I  realised that a lady, who I presume was at least partially blind due to a white cane, had gotten out of her seat and was heading towards the exit with the assistance of a member of staff, who had gotten on the train when I did. 

Without really thinking, I placed my foot in the way of the doors. They opened and closed on my foot a few times before remaining open, allowing the lady and her helper to leave. All I can presume is that the sensors in the door tripped a switch the same way the emergency door release handle was. 

This resulted in a 10-15 minute delay for the guard to work out how to reset the door, I'm guessing pissing off 100 or so commuters.

61436,77097,"AITA Mom wants full payment immediately. I borrowed money from my mom to cover the costs of a flight to my home country for my fiance, which amounted to just over a 1300 dollars. I had almost that amount but as I was about to book the flight and go into my overdraft, my mom insisted on paying, telling me it was a loan, which is fine, I wouldn't have accepted it as a gift anyway. 

We never discussed repayment plans etc 

The money I did have saved for the flight was spent on my fiance and I whilst she was here, as well as ad hoc gifts for my parents and siblings, so it's gone and I'm waiting on my monthly-paid wage to come in at the end of this month. 

Anyway, long story short, she now wants the loan amount back, plus the amount she had previously lent me, about 700usd, all this month, which will be my entire paycheck.

I can see why I should pay her back as much as I can ASAP, since she told me two days ago that she's maxxed out her credit cards, but I have 2 other loans I have to pay back as well as hers (I'm not great with money, as you probably guessed)

For the purpose of this post:
Me - John 
My friend - Alissa 
My girlfriend - Olivia 

I met Alissa in the first year of college, we have always been in the same classes and we became good friends. We really didn’t hang out outside college , so we were not super close.  Fast forward 3 years and we both decided to study abroad in another country, so we went together. We spent half a year living in the same place , and we became super close. We would watch movies together , cook together , travel together , party together etc. 

Keep in mind that none of us ever liked each other more than friends. Or never have we even slightly flirted with each other. As a matter o fact, she has a boyfriend of 8 years who happens to be my best friend. 

A few months after I returned home i met Olivia and we started dating. We have been together for 2 years now. She has always been against my friendship with Alissa saying I shouldn’t be close to someone else since I have a girlfriend. At first I ignored her saying it’s normal to have friends even in a relationship but after a few months Olivia started really being really pushy telling me not to talk to her anymore. I really like this girl and want to make her happy so I stopped talking to Alissa , only texting her like once a month. 

A few months ago was my birthday so Alissa texted me happy birthday and we talked for a while. This made Olivia super mad , and now she is threatening to end the relationship if I refuse to stop talking to  Alissa and if I don’t delete all the photos i have with her in my phone. She says that it’s unacceptable to be in a relationship and talk to a girl who I was so close to. So am I the asshole for standing up against my girlfriend and telling her that she is wrong , and refusing to end my friendship with Alissa?

I work nights and am not able to get much sleep. Am getting worn out by lack of sleep, but debating whether or not it would be a good idea to bring this up with neigbor. 

I live in a duplex and share a wall with one person. The wall shared is the bedrooms and bathroom. The person that lives next door is a single mom and her rambunctious 4-5 year old son. When I say rambunctious I mean like WILD. We had 2 other families live there before them that both had young kids too and they were nothing compared to this kid. 

She has told me he literally will kick on the walls we share and throw his toys at the walls. He is constantly yelling at the top of his lungs. He runs up and down the halls and jumps off his bed (they have wood floors). She knows he's more wild than other kids, but doesn't know what she can do about it, if anything. 

Now the problem is that I work night shift and sleep during the day. After working 10-12 hour shifts I'm only able to sleep at most 4-5 hours. I use everything I can think of to drown it out: earplugs, sound machines, music, pillow over my head, etc. But it's not really enough to drown out the sound of feet on walls. I've been told that I shouldn't expect them to be quiet just because I happen to work nights.

48112,60385,"WIBTA for not ""doing"" Christmas this year, and making my loved ones spend it alone?.  So, as background – my family is incredibly homophobic, and I had not interacted with them for years until I got in contact with my mother last year. She has been sweet and supportive since then, but last Christmas--when I took my husband and son for the holidays--the entire family (besides her) was passive aggressive and cold, even to my then-three year old son. So I didn't spend Thanksgiving with them this year, even though my disabled mother had moved across the country to be closer to me, and was unable to attend without anyone to take her. 

For the past month, I have been getting messages from family members than I am a horrible person and will go to hell for keeping my mother away from her family (who couldn't be bothered to come pick her up themselves, by the way). They are now trying to guilt me into coming back for Christmas this year, and even saying I am a bad father for keeping my son away from them, even though none of them (again, except my mother, I am not angry with her) have put any effort into ever interacting with him, even the few times he was there. My mother is very upset by all of this, and has broken down crying a few times over it. 

Anyway, we ended up spending Thanksgiving with my husband's family, which wasn't much better. No, they aren't homophobic, and they actually treat our son like a person who is there, but they are still incredibly passive aggressive, constantly, and his mother kept making shitty comments to my mother about irrelevant bs. His uncle and dad also wouldn't drop the fact he makes money as an artist while his cousin is an \~accountant\~ which isn't even impressive. Not to mention the fact my husband acts so fake around his family, it kills me. Like, puts on this deep, monotone “straight” voice. Who's benefit is that for? It's so irritating, I hate his damn family. 

So this year, I'm not going anywhere. I will open presents with my son and husband (and mother, if she decides to come over), but I'm not going to his or my family's houses.

I’m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We’re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).

One of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)

Before she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.

Ashley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said “it just sounds like they’re both really insecure” and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).

I chimed in (this was a group convo) “it sounds like all 3 of you are insecure”. And Ashley goes “What? What did I do?” And I replied “date a 14 year old.” 

NOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn’t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. 

She got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was “too far”. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified “that was just for *insert my name here*”

We then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone’s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she’s no longer upset)

I think I am a fairly masculine guy, and no one but my close friends and family know that I am transgender. I'm comfortable with myself, for the most part. 

Here's where it gets tricky: next year I am going to start an apprenticeship as a working cowboy. That means I'm going to be living in a bunkhouse with half a dozen other men. I've lived in close quarters with cisgender men before and had no issue, but nothing this communal or long-term. The showers at the facility are communal, and I've been told that on the range we will probably bathe together in streams and rivers. 

I know most of the guys I'm going to be living with and am friends with several of them. They're good guys, but all straight, conservative men. I'm afraid to tell any of them that I am transgender, even those I've known for some time, because I have no idea how they'd react, and just based on past experience with conservative men it might make the situation ugly and dangerous. Even if that isn't the case, I'm afraid I would be dropped from the apprenticeship. 

My body is masculine, and again the scars from chest surgery aren't noticeable unless you're looking close. The big problem is the lack of a penis (lol).

Personally, I am sick of this. So I like to drink a litte bit extra before eating out and often take a water bottle with me to drink directly after leaving again. I am there to eat nice food, not overpay on water.

So my fiancé and I are friends with this couple, we’ll call them J and K. J met K and they stayed together for a year before K had to leave due to her visa running out. J and K are in a long distance relationship and are engaged.

J still talks to my fiancé and I and today he came around after a long time of not seeing us but still messaging. He brought around this girl, we’ll call her M. Now M was obviously throwing herself at him and he did nothing to stop that. M even “jokingly” belittled K and J didn’t say anything or defend her. She made inappropriate little remarks and he ignored them or flirted back. I found this wholly inappropriate but have no idea whether it is not as much of a big deal as I am making out. 

M also used to be around my fiancé and it was obvious that it was going to make us both uncomfortable yet J still brought her to our house. We became so uncomfortable as she’s known to steal things and treat people badly that we asked them both to leave so they left out the door giggling. I’m now completely rattled as I am friends with both J and K and I feel extremely bad for K as I know it’d hurt me if the roles were reversed.

My husband and I moved just based on our needs for space. We live in a semi-college town, and have had so many issues with loud people (and not just young partiers either). 

Several times, we've tried face to face or letters to ask the offending person(s) to please quiet down. It never works for more than 5 minutes. Our landlords have never cared too much either. (Disclaimer: my husband and I are both 23, so it's not like we're grumpy middle aged people). 

I just called the cops on some young people who actually climbed over the locked fence around the pool outside our apartment window. They have no right to be there, as evidenced by the lock on the gate! They were also loud and playing loud music. Fairly sure some were underage and therefore breaking curfew, because the cops checked everyone's ID.

19949,25396,"WIBTA for giving nonblack middle school students a brief but explicit history of the “n-word” so that they’ll stop using it?. Some background: I’m a white female in my 20’s and I work at a K-8 school district. I mostly work with the P.E. and music teachers but I’m sometimes pulled to fill yard positions. This is my first year working at a school. 

Now for the WIBTA part. There was a group of about five 8th grade Mexican girls that absolutely could not stop swearing.  A variation of “f’ck” was in every sentence at least once. One sentence in particular, and I quote,” oh my f’cking god, like, I f’cking hate that f’cking n’gg’er,” shocked me so much that I said nothing. There were no other adults around and honestly I knew those girls wouldn’t listen to me or respect me; so, I decided to ask my coworkers for advice so I could handle it next time.

When I talked to them, they immediately knew who I was talking about even though I didn’t know the girls’ names, and said that kind of language warranted a referral. They also said to just use the walkie talkie to get ahold of the vice principal so he could handle it instead. And I’m fine with this. 

However, I’m not fine with being verbally abused by a bunch of kids if it comes down to that. I know if I told them to not use that word they would talk back to me and cuss me out. There’s no way they’d listen to anything along the lines of “because it’s a bad word,” “because I said so.” I don’t want to just call for someone they’ll listen to and let them have the idea that they can walk all over me. 

I thought the best way to handle it would be to go into detail about the origin of that word and what it truly meant to the people that it affected. The history of people taken from their homes to be shoved into boats in inhumane conditions, separated from their families, only to be sold and used as property. I’d tell them about the conditions these people endured: the r’pe, the murder, stripping them of their dignity and humanity. All in order to make them understand exactly what the word means and why they shouldn’t use it. Saying it doesn’t make them “cool,” it makes them ignorant asses. (Not sure is this is important but the group of girls in question are a mix of white girls and Mexican girls but only the Mexican girls were saying the word.)

My dilemma, however, is if that would be taking it too far. I have no other means to “punish” them for their language and I dont know how respond otherwise if some kids started cussing me out.

So actually this is a really long story but I'll try to make it actually short. I graduated from high school in May and my parents actually made me get a job when the had actually originally agreed I could chill this summer. 

My dad got me a job working for a contractor doing a job actually getting ready for the SW gas to come in and install a new pipeline. it fucking sucks ass so hard because I'm out in the heat all day, I get hazed all fucking day long, it's like exhausting and it's also killed my energy so I'm getting less healthy by not hitting the gym anymore.  We actually have to be to the shop at 5:15 AM and I'm still actually tired as fuck so I kept screwing up the load out. The owner of the company actually pulled me aside last Monday and cursed at me said ""you fuck everything up, I don't want you to do anything else besides fill up the Igloos (those are water jugs we take out with us to the jobsite). Do you understand me?""  I was actually like whatever man but for the last 3 days I did it perfectly. 

Well this morning I got there and this fucking total asshole Nacho (his actual real name is Ignacio) came and grabbed me and told me he needed my help loading the cement. I told him the boss told me to actually do nothing besides fill the Igloos. Nacho called me ""culo"" (it means ass in Spanish but it also kind of implies pussy as in weak) and actually implied I was a weak ass who couldn't lift and said he'd push me in the trench today if I didn't get off my ass. So I was actually pretty afraid and I helped him. But I completely forgot the igloos because of it. 

Actually when we got to the jobsite the boss realized I'd forgotten the water and screamed his head off at me. Like screamed his head off in front of everyone (which is actually hilarious because I read a lifeprotip yesterday to praise in public, punish in private. I guess he actually runs a shit business and doesn't get it). So he's fuming mad that we had to have water delivered and it cost him precious pennies to get it done. I'm eating my lunch alone now and actually being shunned by everyone else. 

Was I the asshole for this or did I just make a mistake?

edit: some confusing words.. Am I the asshole?","YTA- you had me at “My parents made me get a job when they originally agreed I could chill this summer”. If you’re not in school (and hell for I’m assuming most of us even if you are in school) work is going to be a near lifetime responsibility. The fact that your dad A) found you a job, and B) found one for you in a high pay starting position (any construction job I worked paid waaaay better than minimum wage) was a favor for you. 

Then you got to the point of you being less healthy because you’re not getting to the gym. Unless you’re trying for a specific sport/ activity where muscle twitch and certain balance maneuvers are needed working construction can be about as good as you can ask for workout wise. Try and think of everyday as a work out and if you can prove yourself useful you’ll probably stop getting teased by your fellow crew members. The reason they are picking on you (outside of the fact that you sound like a complaining little bitch) is that they usually get paid better by the work they do and having you around slowing things down and pouting about it being early is hurting their bottom line.  Even if they don’t get paid by the tonnage of work, watching someone else slouch while you bust your ass will piss anyone off. I have a hard time thinking you’d be relegated to water duty if you had shown enthusiasm to learn.

He's been broke and I have been helping him out here and there since, I only make $12/hr working 20 hours a week but I have a good sum saved up in case of emergency.

I am ALWAYS spending money on him, weather it be to feed him, fill his kitchen up with food so he doesn't have to go out to eat alone when I'm not there, drive him around so he doesn't have to spend money on gas and he can focus on just paying his rent and his phone bill. This christmas he didn't buy me a SINGLE thing, and I didn't complain because I understood his situation, whereas I spent $600+ on his gifts, ontop of that he asked me to buy us plan B yesterday and give him $30 for the activity we are doing with my family today (taking them to the gun range, he needed money for ammo)

WELL YESTERDAY, he also got a $1800 check in the mail, went out and bought the ammo and this morning we got into it because he said that I should not tell him I would do something and then take it back, especially because I (still) have more money and make more money than him; he compared it to the fact that If he promised to buy me a puppy of my choice and then I got a new job as a nurse that he would not buy me a puppy anymore because I had the money to do so now would be wrong.

Being one of the low level staff I get asked to do a lot of admin/odd jobs that aren’t anything to do with my job role. 

This has never really bothered me while I was the only one at my my level & being the youngest (22) and hypothetically the fittest, however, a few months ago my work hired two girls my age at my level.

I initially thought great someone to share the load of “crap jobs” with so I can focus more on my actual work. Boy was I wrong 

Whenever it came time to lift a box or screw in a lightbulb I was always the only option,they aren’t allowed to lift a finger and my boss justifies it as “being a gentleman”

Which to me seems like bullshit 
I don’t expect them to be able to do everything, there are some boxes I can hardly lift but they could at least help with the small ones or the other jobs. 

I’m not the strongest either and coupled with the fact I have never had any manual handling training I have done my back in a few times which would have been easily avoided by sharing the job with someone else. 

So anyway we had our annual staff review this week and I decided to ask what the deal was and whether I could split the work. 

I first said that i felt lower than everyone else and I felt it unfair that I was the only one asked to do these jobs despite there being two others at my level.
My boss couldn’t comprehend this.
He said “you dont expect the girls to do this do you?” To which I said “yes and I find it quite sexist”

11058,14158,"AITA for being upset over the way my parents treated my ex?. So recently, my long time SO and I broke up. When we started dating she was my boyfriend, but she came out to me as trans. I really wanted to give it a try because I loved her- but we found we weren’t sexually compatible anymore, so instead of dragging the relationship out and resenting each other we decided to mutually split so we could maintain our friendship. It has been so much better now- and it almost feels like I gained a sister rather then lost a partner.

Here is the problem. We had been living with my parents and paying rent. I had been on disability and could barely afford to live, and then my family needed help financially so we paid a good amount of rent and everyone was fine with the arrangement. They called my SO their family and loved her.

When we broke up, we obviously planned on her finding a new place to stay. Sharing a room was a little tight for us anyway and we though more personal space now that we weren’t dating was good.

We didn’t even get a chance to tell my parents that.

Less than 24 hours after we broke up my parents said she had 2 weeks to get out. I was shocked because they had never been hostile to her before- and they couldn’t even wait a few days to tell us she needed to move out. My ex is really hurt by this- her family was not supportive of her coming out and my family had become her adoptive family. She feels like she lost yet another family.

I tried to talk to them about this and they just said ‘this is hard for us too’ and wouldn’t talk to me at all. Luckily we have a friend who happened to have a spare room for a good price offer my ex a room so we are moving her out in time, but my feelings are really hurt.

I didn’t expect her to keep living with us- and it’s their house so I respect their rules- but we paid rent and having them spring this on us less than 24 hours after we broke up really has caused a rift between us. 

So, AITA for being really upset with them? I’m honestly having a hard time imaging how I’ll forgive them.

861,1047,"AITA for telling my best friend her study habits are terrible?. My best friend and roommate in college (senior year) is a dedicated student who spends basically all of her free time studying. Sometimes it gets on my nerves because she'll act like I'm being inconsiderate when I ask if she has time to watch a movie or something, like how could she ever take a few hours to chill. She is constantly studying but never getting ahead in her work. Based on the amount she studies, she should have perfect grades, but she never does as well as she thinks she should. I personally believe this is because she has ineffective studying habits, such as copying all concepts down in quizlet and overanalyzing everything she turns in to the point she takes much longer on an assignment than I think anyone should.

My friend and I are very different on this front. I have nearly perfect grades, but I spend much less time studying because I believe I have found study tricks that work so I'm spending less time being more effective, rather than spending an entire day being only slightly effective. She often chalks this up to a difference in our personalities and learning abilities, but I disagree, I think she could change her study habits and benefit. So, the other day, I came home and she was clearly stressed and said, ""Why do I feel like I'm constantly studying but I never feel like I get anything done?"" She asked, so I just said bluntly, ""If you want me to be completely honest with you, I think it's because your study habits are ineffective,"" and I explained my reasoning. She started tearing up (she was clearly already drained from studying all evening) and I tried to explain what I meant and tried to give her suggestions of things to try instead of her current ways. 

It is hard for me to watch her spending so much time with little academic payoff, so I thought my honesty would help. Ever since then, she has barely talked to me, and when I bring it up she says she's fine and she's not mad. I can tell she hasn't tried adjusting her study habits. I'm worried maybe I was a little blunt and maybe it's not worth trying to change your study habits in senior year anyway. I'm overthinking it now because I'm very unconfrontational and I've never really done something like that and I just want to know, am i the asshole? .

54864,68927,"AITA for avoiding all forms of interaction with my friend’s roommate?. On mobile so apologizing in advance for any formatting issues!

My friend and I are both juniors in college. I have my own apartment and she still lives in a dorm where she still shares an actual room with a roommate. My friend will be called Mary, and her roommate shall be called Brittney. 

A year ago, I met a guy named Josh. Josh and I were friends and both single, so we hooked up once. It was a one time thing neither of us really enjoyed so we put it past us and moved on because we’re mature adults. Several weeks later, Josh and some of our friends met Brittney at a party that I didn’t go to. There was immediate chemistry between the two and they started dating. Naturally, Josh was open about what happened between us as he felt it was important to disclose. She did not take this well, and immediately began treating me differently. Ignoring me when I directly spoke to her, refusing to acknowledge me, and other petty behavior. Overall, extremely childish. I learned to ignore this. 

Brittney has self diagnosed herself with bipolar depression, and I’m told is a huge fan of essential oils. She regularly has panic attacks where she texts her friends (including Mary) demanding they come to wherever she’s at immediately as she needs their comfort. I know it’s not my place, but as someone that has depression and is on medication, I think I have some right to be suspicious if she’s using her supposed panic attacks to gain attention. 

It’s been a year since we met her and her and Josh have broken up since. He doesn’t go to college with us anymore so he isn’t a subject of conflict, but I still don’t want to interact with her 1, because of her previous behavior towards me and 2, her current attention seeking ploys. Mary is always asking me to come over to her dorm but I refuse because there’s no guarantee I won’t run into Brittney. I tell her we can hang at my apartment or somewhere else on campus but Mary doesn’t feel like leaving her dorm.

Anyway, none of us kids talk to her, but my dad does (I should mention they are divorced). And apparently, she's been going to therapy and the therapist has been trying to get it through to her that she's done all of this to herself, and that she has to reach out to us to make the relationship better. And my dad, every time we see him, begs us to try and talk to her. And I try to tell him, ""No, if she wants to talk to us, she should know how to act.

One condition my husband has for flying is that he will only fly business class, and only direct flights. Usually this is not a problem, but with the Max 8 situation, every flight is either economy or 1 stop.

Background info: I'm about to turn 19 and I'm halfway through my 2nd semester of college and my parents still track me through my phone via the Life360 app. Them tracking my phone made sense to me when I first started driving because I was in high school and maybe they wanted to track my driving habits. But now since I'm in college, I'm realizing it's a little ridiculous.

Their reasons behind it is that I'm the eldest child and the first to leave the house, making my mother anxious. Also there's the history with my family and making poor life decisions when leaving for college. And I understand that they don't want me going down the same path, but I have literally never rebelled. For example, my parents had to physically force me to not go to school for senior skip day. That's how much of a ""goody two shoes"" I was and still am.

They're afraid of me making poor life decisions like getting drunk or having an unintentional pregnancy but I've never expressed any interest in any of these activities.

So to the problem at hand: I'm trying to be more social but I can't exactly do that when my parents are breathing down my neck all the time. They will literally question me about my whereabouts when I'm not in my dorm or in class, even if it's just to go to the mall or get food off of campus. It wouldn't be that bad if they didn't question and call me about where I am so much (which is almost everyday). It's not like I want to do anything bad or illegal, I'd just like a little bit of freedom.

I've expressed this to my parents but they're adamant on tracking me. When I try to explain that I'm 19, my mother says that she's a grown adult and \*she\* still has the app on her phone.

So WIBTA if I just turned the app off even though they told me explicitly not to?

2) he claims that he wouldn't be able to fall asleep with another people in the room
3) he doesn't like idea of 4 drunk people in one room (even though my brother and his friend aren't big fans of alcohol)

So we hang out for 2 times and the majority of us are there and I suggest that we go to the movies but then he says he doesn't wanna leave someone out and was like, why are you even that excited it's just a movie.

So today I was already out to finish some papers with 2 friends of mine which we've een trying to finish for a while, didn't pan out and were pretty disappointed. Figured we were near the cinema and 20 minutes from the start of the movie. Went to the movie and my friend who wasn't with us was like let's go to the movies now and I texted him a photo from the movies. He's now a bit mad and tells me he doesn't wanna hangout again, is he entitled to be mad?

14592,18654,"AITA for not allowing a homeless vet to use the washroom at the hotel I work at?. I am asking because I feel like an asshole but I am also standing by what happened, so if I am an asshole in this situation then that's ok. 

I work night shifts at a hotel so all my interactions with this man have been around 3 in the morning. The first night he came in looking for a room for him and his dog, I told him I couldn't help him because he had no money but gave him a number to call for victim services and vets canada that often pay for people to stay in situations like this. I also called him a cab that gives free rides after 2am. 

The next day, I come into work and he is staying. He had called one of the numbers I gave him and vets canada was paying for his room. All good. 3am rolls around and he stumbles out of his room and starts yelling at me for not giving him a room last night and for calling him a cab. Apparently his dog attacked the cab driver and was taken from him, for which he blamed me. 

The next 4 days he proceeded to harass every staff member. He yelled at everyone, would watch porn on the business center computers, he made the front desk staffs lives hell for those 4 days. He also got meals paid for by vets canada, so he got to eat at the buffet located in the hotel, but he would wear these oil covered gloves and touch all the food, literally running his hands through the rice, so the restaurant started to refuse to feed him. I still tried to help, I told the buffet to just pack up some food to go and it could be delivered to his room. 

Well, he eventually harassed vets canada so much that they called us and told us not to extend his stay. I thought that was the end of it. Until he came in 20 minutes ago asking to use our public washrooms. They are public washrooms, so anyone can technically use them but I told him no because I feared that if we continued to let him in the hotel, then we would never get rid of him and he would continue to harass everyone. So am I the asshole? . Am I the asshole?",NTA. Sounds like you’ve done what you could. His behaviour may be linked to his service but you can only do so much to manage that,0,0,0,0,1
13938,17840,"AITA for not wanting to speak to or even look at my Dad?. Some background: Mom and dad been together about 25 years in a horrible marriage. Dad had been emotionally abusive to her, me and my brother all our lives. About 8 years ago, my mom decided she had enough and refused to take anymore shit from him. Decided to leave once the kids (us) were older. Since I was a kid, my dad tried to drive a wedge between my brother and I (for a long time, it worked, but it's all good now) and even tried to brainwash me against my mom (never worked). He keeps playing the victim, more so, now that literally none of us want anything to do with him. 

I'm in uni now and am basically living off of his money, but I never call him. Barely even reply to his texts. Talking to him ruins my day. Am I the asshole for using his money (without any guilt) but keeping my contact at a bare minimum?

21454,27247,"AITA for ruining my families monopoly game?. So around the days I was getting married, we had a family gathering. My cousins and siblings had started a monopoly game that lasted 7 hours, with some breaks in between, but they played for 7 hours until I got involved. Now, if you play the Monopoly board game the right way and follow the rules to the T then the game shouldn't last more than 2-3hours. However they decided to put tax money in free parking, they would team up when one was losing or someone else was too powerful, they would forgive large payments at hotels because of behind the back deals, and other horsefuckery. I was busy doing my own stuff getting ready for the wedding at first, but then I was free and wanted to chill but the game would never end. By the 7th hour, I had had enough they needed to move on and we needed to do other things because it's rare when we have all the family together and things were getting heated, people were fighting and getting annoyed with each other. So I topple the board over, thinking I was helping everyone by giving them an out. BUT it was at this time that I realized that I had fucked up and I thought I wasn't going to make it to my wedding alive. You should have seen everyone's faces, extreme rage redirected from the game to me. They literally went apeshit. I felt bad too. Everyone was pissed and sad I was an asshole. They eventually reset the board and continued playing. And I moved on and went to play Apples to Apples with my younger family members.

28282,35726,"AITA for not wanting to argue about a controversial issue in front of SO's friends?. My (43F) significant other (52M) and I agree on most things but we are recently disagreeing about a controversial issue that has come up in our community (small-ish Canadian city). A group of promoters is asking the city, province and the federal government to build a stadium for a professional football team. I won't get into the details of the proposal but to cut to the chase, I don't think it's a good idea but my SO does. My professional background is in community economic development, my SO is active in the amateur football community, including being a longtime youth coach. We have talked about it privately and I have explained my opinion on why, objectively, this initiative is a bad deal for the city. He agrees that there is no ""rational"" reason to support the stadium, but he still supports it based on his personal desire to attend games. I can understand that - football is fun to watch and I can see why it would be exciting to have a professional team in the community. I have no doubt that I would enthusiastically attend games if the city does go ahead. But until then, we can agree to disagree.

Here's the problem. His group of friends is enthusiastically and (I think) obnoxiously supportive of a stadium. They argue ""facts"" that are incorrect - these are things that he agreed were wrong when we spoke about it in private. I work for the city and really can't speak openly about this issue. 

We have plans to attend a homecoming weekend in a neighbouring community in a few weeks, and my SO has made it clear that the stadium will be the prominent topic of conversation, and that he intends to be vocally supportive, including making remarks that he agreed were not true when we spoke about the issue in private. I don't feel comfortable speaking up because (a) I work for the city but also (b) all of his friends will be in support and I will be outnumbered and (c) I fear this will devolve into my SO and I getting into an argument in front of his friends, made worse by the reality that we will both likely be too intoxicated to simply leave the situation if it gets too unpleasant, and we won't be close to just go home. Would I be the asshole if I decided to not attend the homecoming event with my SO?. Am I the asshole?","I don’t really understand what judgement you want from us.

45409,57016,"AITA for being annoyed at my aunt for dumping her kids of my grandmother while my mum gets no help?. I (F16) have two siblings a younger sister (13) and a younger brother (9). My younger brother has special needs and my grandmother on my step-dad's side (57) has worked with kids with special needs for a majority of her career.  
 My aunt (who works in real estate four days a week) continually leaves her kids (F 8) and (M 5) with my grandmother for weekends and short amounts of time (3-4 days min) to go on holidays and to have time for her and her husband. While I recognize that it is important to have time for yourself my grandmother is often left tired and unable to help my mother when she needs someone to get my brother off of the bus after school or to look after him for a few hours on the weekend.  
 My mum is a part-time midwife and often works 12 hour days and sometimes has to leave early or turn down shifts because nobody can get my brother off of the bus, his school won't let me do it and his dad also works long hours.  
A few notes  
\- my brother has special needs but doesn't require constant supervision, he likes to be in the company of people but cannot be home alone (although what 9-year-old can?)

\- I am not at my mum's house seven days a week, I help out as much as I can but I also have school and VCE to study for

\- My aunt only works 4 days a week and makes a decent amount of money, I understand her not wanting to spend money on a babysitter or nanny all the time but occasionally it's not too bad.

\- My aunt basically leaves the parenting to my grandmother and that's not fair on her, she's already raised her kids.

\- My grandmother doesn't want to say no to my aunt because she doesn't want to disappoint her.

26829,33912,"AITA For asking my MIL to stop posting candid pics of me after I've asked her not to?. To start, my MIL is one of those middle aged ladies who is ALWAYS on fb. My husband and I have been together for 11 years, during our 1st year of dating his mother would take unwanted and at times unflattering pics of me and post them to fb without asking. The first time I asked her not to she got VERY pouty and offended.  After a couple more years of this I very politely asked her again to stop because I want to have a career in administration in public education and I don't want pictures of me in my pjs for anyone to see. It means that posts to social media give me extreme anxiety no matter who posts them. I worry for my career image. I told her about my anxiety disorder and how it affects me and she said,""Well you just need to get over that."" I was very hurt, but kept it to myself. That was about 5 years ago.

Flash forward to 4 weeks ago. So, this last time we went out we took them fishing(my hubby loves to fish)and she took some of me trying to get the hook out of the fishes mouth(think hunched over and camping hair.) She promised she wouldn't post any pictures of me except for the standard family selfie one. Well, she posted all of them anyway. Then texted me,""Let me know if you don't like any of them so I can take them down."" Which to some might seem thoughtful, but I think she knows would make me look whiney, plus she promised not to post them AS SHE WAS TAKING THEM.

33105,41794,"AITA for wanting my girlfriend of 3 years to have a key to my and my roommates' apartment?. tl;dr: my roommate thinks it's unacceptable for my girlfriend to have a key to our place, despite the fact that 70-80% of the cookware, dishes, spices and groceries in the apt are hers, and she frequently makes us all dinner there and stays there (with his blessing) about 5 nights a week.  




Little bit of background:  We've been dating for three years and have been friends with my current roommate for longer.  My current roommate and I have been living together since July, in a 2 bedroom apt with a sizable kitchen.  Due to having religious fanatics for parents and the fact that we still rely on them financially, my girlfriend and I (both 22) are unable to officially live together, though functionally we have for nearly 2 years, staying at each others' places.  This arrangement was well known to my friend prior to rooming together and we checked with him on multiple occasions to make sure he'd be ok with it.


Since she doesn't have a key, and we have wildly different class/work schedules, if I leave before her in the morning from her place she can't get into my place and use any of her food or cookware until we all get back home sometime late at night.  


When we've discussed this he's cited it as ""a matter of principle"" that since she's not on the lease, she can't have a key, and has been telling various people in our social circle about how shitty we're being in asking this.  He's told us that everyone he has asked has told him how weird and inconsiderate we're being and agrees that she shouldn't have a key.  This hit her really hard, as they've been very close friends for years, and she spends most of the time she's not sleeping at our place.

38572,48481,"AITA for not responding to boss's texts on day off/when not working?. My boss is sort of what you might call a micro-manager or maybe just neurotic. We have three employees and by som weird stroke of luck I only work/see him once a week. I'm either off or working with the other employee during the week. However, Other Employee is leaving us at the end of the week so it'll just be me and Bossman. Bossman sends out several texts during the week. He never sends them before 10 am and never after 10pm but he sends them even when one of us isn't working. It can be anything from requests from us two employees, a copy of the new schedule, a request for one of us to run to the bank before our next shift, any issues he may be having with something performance-wise, updates on the list of things in the store that get commissions. Strictly put, it's all general information.

We're not in health care, we don't save lives, we aren't the police or law enforcement of any kind, what we do is not life and death. I'm paid about a dollar and a half above minimum wage. Not replying to a text will not result in the store burning down, or someone dying. I'm a firm believer in a separation of work and personal. I don't bring my personal life to work me and I don't bring work home with me. I work in a shop, I'm not saving lives. I have never responded to text messages from any employer now or in the past, as a matter of principal. If the correspondence is important then I ask they call me and speak to me. If you're going to, say, ask me to work when I'm not scheduled or do something beyond the scope of my duties, then have the decency to treat me with a little respect.

When we text him about something he doesn't respond until the next time he works. So, let's say he's off on a Tuesday but works on Wednesday afternoon and I text him on a Tuesday with a question he won't respond until he works on Wednesday. If its an emergency then responding at that late stage basically negates my texting him which means I'm forced to come up with a solution on my own or do nothing, either of which usually winds up with me getting a text lecture on how I screwed up, whatever I do.

Anyway, my boss has seemingly cottoned on to the fact that I don't respond to texts so at the end of every message  he adds ""Helen, please respond promptly so can confirm receipt."" Despite this I haven't changed how I handle things. The only way to show my boss that my job is not my be all-end all, that he does not own me, is by maintaining the separation, by maintaining my principals.

24863,31449,"AITA for not wanting to be my father’s caretaker?. My dad has been in and out of the hospital since Oct 2018, relapsing from a MSSA infection multiple times. Next week is my 21st birthday and all of my family from another state is coming. And now they’re coming a day early, including my senile grandmother. 

I know my mom is stressed the fuck out. We’re very close and I was visiting for four days last week to help while he was in the hospital. I also had to go out of town for a friend’s grad the weekend before... in my bf’s grandparents vehicle because the night before we left, my transmission died. The whole time I was at home last week we were trying like crazy to shop for cars. I appreciate my mom so so much and I know she’s really being put through the ringer. She told me, “I think in a past life I was really selfish and now I’m being punished or something.” It was kind of a joke... but not really. 

I’ve been so drained from the physical and emotional exertion of the previous 10 days that I literally haven’t been able to stay awake during the day this week. 

Now to tonight - I’m closing my restaurant job, mopping, and my dad calls. Asks me if I can now come this Tuesday instead of this Saturday to help my mom and help take care of him. I don’t think my mom knows he’s asking me this. I don’t think she’d like it that he’s asking. 

I know he’s asking because he needs me and because it would make my mom happy. But I immediately wanted to cry when he asked me. I got anxious and stressed and guilty. He’s really good at guilt. I have a lot of emotional problems bc of this, and that’s all one really needs to know. 

So I guess... AITA for thinking this is asking too much? I now have to get this weeks shifts covered, leave my bf without a vehicle, and I get to be stressed out and spiraling for my birthday. I feel so selfish when I say that, but everyone else is telling me that he’s being selfish to ask.

Now anyway, as we were drinking one of the guy friends, we'll call Steve, said that he thinks he is ''in love'' with his girlfriend and that there's ''noone else in the world that he loves more than her''. Now we can call the other guy Joe and the other two girls Bethany and Katy. Joe congratulated him and Bethany and Katy said ''awwwh''. I congratulated him too that he's found a girl he really likes.

Then they turned to me and asked whether I love my girlfriend. I said that I do, but I don't know why I said this, as I was drunk, I just blurted out ''I love her very much, I really do, but...there's noone in the whole world that I love more than myself. Not even my own mother.''

They looked at me startled and the girls said ''That's such a fucking douchey thing to say''. I quickly changed the topic, but when I think of it, I don't see the issue. It's socially acceptable for a guy to say he loves his girlfriend/wife more than anyone, or it's socially acceptable for a mother to say she loves her son more than anyone (or a father loves his daughter more than anyone).

She recently texted me, telling me that she cheated on him with her ex boyfriend, and her current boyfriend ended the relationship.

Little backstory on her ex, he's a huge piece of trash. They dated for a year prior and he was a horrible human being to her. He controlled who she saw, talked to, what she did, she basically was only allowed to go work, and straight home. If he wasn't dictating what she could do, he was going through her phone, trash talking our family and insisted if she ever saw us again, he would leave her. They broke up a few times, off and on until I had to help her move out of her house with a police escort so he wouldn't go crazy. She moved in with me for a short time. 

She left the relationship and found her current boyfriend, he's transitioning from female to male. A lovely guy, funny, smart, and an overall great match for my sister.

1) We're not really friends, she is more part of my friend group that I hang out with.

2) I'm Muslim and whilst not as strict as some I still consider myself a Muslim.

My parents have retired back to my mother's birth country and bought an old house that they've restored. It's a traditional North African house so has things like a hammam (sauna) and is located in the centre of the old city so it's a hot tourist destination. The country in question is VERY Muslim and as such is homophobic and transphobic. My parents have been restoring the houses for nearly a decade now and modernising it and to celebrate they asked if I wanted to invite some friends round and they could visit the country/town.

I immediately asked some of my friends and we've planned the trip for Spring 2020. Someone asked if I wanted to invite our MtF trans friend I said that it wouldn't be a good idea. I have always kept my opinions to myself and never discussed my thoughts with anyone, but she does not pass at all and very obviously has a man's body. My parents would very much be against having her there and I'm pretty sure she might be attacked if she were to come. She would also have to wear a headscarf when we visit some sites (already explained to female friends who are happy to do so) and it would be seen as very disrespectful as people would assume it's a man mocking the religion. 

She found out that I didn't invite her and accused me of being transphobic in our group chat. I tried explaining that for her own safety it would be best if she didn't come (and truthfully I just don't like her) and that my parents would not be happy with the situation. She's not hearing any of it though and is turning this into a huge issue now.

47428,59552,"WIBTA for evicting my disabled friend?. My (27F) friend (27M) has been staying with me and my mother for the last 3 months. For a little context, we have been friends for 8 years and met in college. My friend is disabled (quadriplegic), however, he is somewhat physically able. The important note is that I am very protective and try to be as supportive as possible for my friend. 

Over the last year, my friend would argue with his dad about being unemployed and still living at home. Eventually, their fighting escalated and his dad kicked him out. Previously, I told my friend that he could move in with me and my mother if he couldn't find a place.  I did ask for her permission before and explained that it was just until he could get back on his feet. Prior to this, I did ask how long he would need to get himself ready and he estimated about a month. He also offered to pay for rent and utilities while he was there. My mother said that he did not need to and knew that he was struggling so she was happy to help. As the weekend grew closer, my friend called me at work and took my offer. He moved in pretty quick after that. 

In the first month, my friend would stay home mostly, only occasionally leaving. I assumed he was either working on job applications or meeting friends for lunch. Later in the month, My mother began asking how long I thought he would continue to stay and dropped, not-so-subtle hints about missing her privacy. This kind of made me a little nervous about the situation.  I just started my second degree and I am also working full time so I have been spread thin and the situation is complicated. Well one weekend, I learned that my friend has seen his dad multiple times to go out or help them with things at their house. Also, when I told my mom , she mentioned that she knew and found it odd that they kicked him out over an argument but would continuously pick him up to take him places or out to eat. Recently, my mom started to become more adamant about finding out exactly when he would leave and even proposed that I should tell him to move out before the end of the year or back with his parents. 

At this time, I am approaching exams and I just don't feel like dealing with the situation, however, I know I need to since it's my friend. Also I'm just worried that my friend would think I am betraying them if I asked them to leave. 

So, WIBTA if I evicted my disabled friend?. Am I the asshole?","NTA. Your friend is taking advantage at this point. Your mom wants him out, it’s your job to tell him that.",0,0,0,0,1
50847,63788,"AITA for refusing to sell my ex-girlfriend’s jewellery to my SIL?. I [25M] had been dating my girlfriend [23F] for 5 years. Over the years, I bought several pieces of jewellery to her, including a necklace/earring set, a promise ring, and a Cartier bracelet.

We ended things last month. It still is very fresh in my mind and I miss her everyday. Before she left, she returned these things to me, and said it would be weird of her to wear it when she’s no longer with me. I told her to keep it but she returned them anyways.

I was mentioning this at supper the other day at my brother’s house. His wife, 39F, approached me after supper and asked what jewelry she returned. I told her, and she asked me if I wanted the Cartier bracelet off my hands, I could sell it to her. 

Apparently she always liked the bracelet, which was customized, and said she can’t find it anywhere else. She said she would pay original price for it.

I told her frankly that I don’t think I’d ever sell it. She looked disappointed.

Later on, my brother called me, and said that I should still consider selling it. He said I could sell it to him and he would give it to her as an anniversary present. He said “I don’t know what else you could do with it other than letting it gather dust.”

I told him “not a chance”. He hung up, also annoyed with me. I talked with my sister about this and she said I should consider it, that it makes financial sense and would make my brother and SIL very happy. She said holding onto it would prevent me from getting over my ex. She says I’m being stubborn and callous.

We were long distance dating for a while and he wanted to help me get help.  I lived in PA while he lived in UT. Well I eventually moved in and across the country with him after we discussed it and in doing this, I was disowned from my entire family. I didn't have a job (I had quit it to move and the move was rather sudden planned on moving in May and I ended up moving 2 months earlier than I planned). So I started volunteering at the local Aquarium to keep me busy as I looked for a job. It had taken me 5 months to find a decent job here in Utah. During that time I was trying but there wasn't much to do in science without a PH.D in academia. He comes from a family of very good means (his mom has fuck you money) and his mother constantly berated me for not having a job and she told him that he should protect himself from being taken advantage of and I should have gotten a temp job in between while looking. He had told me that frankly I didn't need to work, and he wanted me to go to a place where I would be happy. Eventually I found a good job in R&D for a pharma company and we finally started to pull ahead financially from me moving in. He proposed to me about a month ago and we are genuinely happy for one another. I honestly feel as if I am the luckiest girl alive and am greatful for him every day for just coming into my life. 

The problem: He recently was offered a significant promotion, which would require us to move to Seattle. His mother lives in Seattle. I don't want to pidgenhole him in his carrier and he would be climbing essentially 4 management positions (from middle management to just below the CFO). I don't think I could bare to have 0 support surrounding me and I have issues making friends due to my childhood (I shut down and don't talk a lot) so I havent made very close friends here in UT. We talked it over and I wouldnt have to work, and can finally persue my goal of going for a PH.D. The only thing I'm worried about is him or his mother thinking I am taking advantage of him.

She typically tells me things and asks me questions she isn’t comfortable talking with her mom about. She asked me if I would keep a secret and not thinking ( it is usually who she has a crush on), so I stupidly said yes. 

Well it turns out her secret is the weekend before her friend’s mom dropped her and her friend off all day at a busy amusement park alone. The friends mom told my niece not to tell her mom. This really rubbed me the wrong way, and I told her as much. 

Nothing happened to my niece, while there, except the mom didn’t leave them with any except a cell phone and sun screen.

50717,63631,"AITA for being upset with my daughter and wife for keeping her pregnancy from me?. My daughter is 23 years old and lives with us, for the context of this story. I am aware she doesn’t have to tell me anything about her medical history or her current situations. That being said, I need to know if I’m an asshole for being pissed that she lied to me.

My daughter has one child already. I handled the news of the first pregnancy fine. It was unexpected, but we all adjusted and we were doing well. After that, she was very firm on not having more kids. That’s why I never expected this. About a year ago, she had a kidney infection and it’s genetic. Recently, she’s had to go to the ER constantly due to excessive nausea and fainting. My wife takes her and I have to stay behind with our younger kids, and my granddaughter. My wife and daughter would tell me that it was because of her kidneys and that she had issues with hydration. This happened several times in a one-month span. I was getting very nervous and would offer to go with them to the ER, but my wife insisted it just be them.

Finally, my daughter sat me down and owned up to the fact that she was pregnant. She said it wasn’t planned, that she was disappointed in herself and that the real reason she had been going to the ER so much, was that it was a complicated pregnancy. I wasn’t upset about the pregnancy in the slightest. I congratulated her and said that we would find a way to make it work, asked questions about the condition of the pregnancy.

However, I was upset that she had been lying to me about what was going on. Her kidney infection was serious and threw us all for a loop. I thought we were going through it again. I didn’t say this when she announced it, but waited a few days before sitting her and my wife down, saying they should have told me. They explained they were worried about my reaction. I asked why, considering I was fine last time. They said, because the “timing is bad”. I said even if they didn’t want to tell me, lying about her kidneys was a jerk move.

29976,37887,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to play online games with other dudes?. EDIT: I'm putting this at the top because people seem to be taking my opinion the wrong way. I WOULD NEVER PREVENT HER FROM PLAYING WITH GUYS. I haven't and wont. I'm more so asking if what I'm feeling is wrong. The title is broad. Please focus on the actual body of the question.

I met my now girlfriend on Fortnite of all places. We really kicked it off and have developed, what I consider a really good relationship.

The concern occurred when I genuinley started to really like her and it still does. She accepts friend requests from a lot of guys. I'm fairly certain her whole friends list is guys. I've also noticed they join her party, (shes not a fantastic player) even if they are vastly better than her. The reason I can only assume for this is because she is a girl. And when I say they join her party, it happens at least 1 time every hour if the party is set to open (typically always different guys). And most of the time I can tell they are all just horny because I met her the same way, doing the same things. I already know my girlfriend is not the asshole. 

There has been times where they even acquired her ig. Given, she posts absolutely nothing there, but obviously the guys intention is to see what she looks like and get a route of communication outside of the game. Same thing happens with discord and often they ask about other games she plays etc.
 
This is where I sort of understand the other side: guys are the majority of the playerbase in games. So I know I fully cant and shouldn't stop her from playing with guys, but I just cant help but know shes constantly being hit on and she seems oblivious to it. It makes me feel like I need to be online constantly when she is just to cock block everyone. Its tiring and annoying...

Any thoughts on what I should do? How should I approach it etc?

EDIT: thank you guys for responding. I basically knew the answers I'd get. It's just sort of difficult. While I do trust her, it's just hard to hear the constant hints etc from other guys.  

Maybe I posted this in the wrong category: I DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES tell her not to play with certain people. I'm not that much of an asshole. I mainly just wanted to know if what I'm feeling is normal. I guess I'm jealous. At the same time though I trust her. It's just sort of bugs me that it happens.. Am I the asshole?",YTA.

55251,69397,"AITA (M22) for telling somebody (F25) to stop saying she's got a mental disease without a diagnosis in order to get attention?. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've known this girl for about half a year now. We met via a popular augmented reality game. At first she seemed like a quirky person, but polite. Once she got acknowledged in our local gaming community (we all share a mutual communication channel, and are split into multiple city regions), things started to go downhill. From what I could observe, she's been actively trying to pull attention to herself, like talking about his partner or her depression on public channels with around \~500 daily readers (everyone from the same city), or generally being passive-aggressive to people (either new or old players) in our local group for no particular reason.

At first I thought she genuinely needs help, so I tried to be as supportive as I could. I let her vent out when she wanted to, told her everything's gonna be alright, and gave some advice on how to improve her life (long story short, she's a NEET dependent on her boyfriend). We talked about her ambitions, how she would love to do things other than playing video games all day long. Naturally, the first step would be to find a job, and this is what I told her. That was around two months ago. Today, she's still not working, still saying her life is miserable. Nothing changed a slightest bit. I must admit, I grew tired of listening to this. I am not going to let an energy vampire suck off my good mood on a daily basis.

On several occassions, she said she has the Asperger syndrome. Like, casually mentioning it. A few days ago, she went on her regular venting talk and said she's got Aspergers, and this prevents her from communicating well with other people. At some point I snapped and straight out asked:

>Do you have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist? If you do, then feel free to keep talking. If you don't, then don't self-diagnose yourself over Wikipedia, because you're just using this terrible disease as a wild card to get other people's attention. This is toxic and disrespectful to people that actually do struggle with the disease.

I realised I fucked up, as she started to tell me I am in no position to talk about her life because she knows better, that I am the Know-It-All, and in general that I should go fuck myself. She's left our mutual convo and haven't rejoined ever since.

I asked our mutual friend about it, and received a response, which basically say: ""she just needs to vent out, rather than seek help, and you trying to share your POV will not bring any good, as every day you are becoming more and more arrogant towards her as you keep pushing"".

So, am I the asshole, or am I just being guilt tripped for calling her out on her bullshit?

   Generally about 6 days a week we have a family dinner/order out together. I’m a closer at work so I usually come home to leftovers and therefore don’t have a say in dinner. I am never told what it is (though I could ask during my break) so it’s always a surprise. They’ll get/cook mexican about once a month or so and leave me something random like a burrito or a few tacos only for me to remind them again and again that I don’t like mexican. 

   On these days I’ll throw together some leftovers from previous nights or order out for myself. It’s gotten genuinely irritating to come home from work to see a plate of food I don’t like and they know I don’t like just to go around in a circle telling them I don’t like this food and to please tell me ahead of time so I can just order something on my way home only to have it happen again in 3 weeks.

I said, “Boo, this is my side, I’m not gonna tell you again.” He got up and then went to sit on the other side for a few minutes, his back turned to me, saying nothing. He does this as a sort of meditative thing, I guess to keep calm, so I didn’t say anything.

I did my best to stop it before it happened but ultimately people are going to make their own choices and take their own actions.  Anyway, here it goes. 

A friend and I went to a concert, she had a few drinks and got into an altercation with another woman. They began fighting, and the the girls boyfriend tackled and put his hands around the neck of my friend during the fight. I tried to pull him off, and couldn’t. Fearing for my friends safety, I kicked the guy in his head as hard as I could. I was told later that night he was taken to the hospital for an epileptic seizure. It turns out, he was friends with my gf’s friends, and they were all talking about it at the bar the other night. Last night, my girlfriend informs me what happened, to which I respond that I felt bad the situation happened, but I feel I acted in defense of my friend, and that a man should never assault a woman, especially if he’s epileptic. Basically, everyone thinks I’m an asshole because I refuse to accept fault when I believe I acted in defense of a woman. Sure that woman started it, but the man had no right to attack her. To be honest, I’d do it again. I will never tolerate a man putting hands on a woman. And I only got involved when he started attempting to strangle my friend.

When I was pregnant, I had made a few jokes about how my husband should ""find a girlfriend"" because I was too sick and uncomfortable to get in the mood. Except my husband SOMEHOW thought I was being serious and started sleeping with one of his female friends. They had a long distance friends-with-benefits thing going on for a few years until one of his friends told me about it.

He says since she lives on the other side of the country and he doesn't ""really talk to her that much anymore"", it shouldn't be an issue.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and have a 2 year old. We split every bill down the exact middle. Every thing from rent, utilities, to groceries and have separate accounts. I don’t expect anything other than being fair. 

He got mad at me for asking him to split the cost of our sons daycare saying he could offer $40 to a $160 payment. I, especially when it’s comes to our son, expect to split things in half so I was frustrated. 

Before I get to the argument I want to say that he makes $7 more an hour than I do. His weekly checks are $50ish short of my biweekly checks, give or take, but I also dive into my works benefits so my checks are smaller. 

We got into an argument about money because I live paycheck to paycheck while he’s able to save thousands to set aside and blows his money. I never treat myself and sometimes it’s exhausting to see him flaunting whatever while I save up. I don’t complain because I signed up to be a parent and I have to make sacrifices. 

He asked for a solution and I offhandly said that I think whoever makes more money should have to pay more for bills. He’s been pissed for MONTHS since. It’s a never ending fight and I’m over it. When we first got together I made $2 more an hour and paid for everything and bought him things before we had responsibilities. 

I never said he had to. I gave an opinion and he’s upset i “still haven’t apologized” but I’m standing my ground.

Yesterday morning, my boyfs alarm went off at 6am (as usual on a weekday) for the gym. For the first time ever, I was already awake as I'd struggled to sleep. 

We got up together and he asked if I wanted to join him. I'd been up all night worried about work so decided to head to work early to get stuff done. We said bye and distinctly said 'see you in a few hours'. He left before me. As I left, his keys were in the door and I took them out and put them onto the key rack. I don't remember doing this as I was so tired from not sleeping properly. I got to work for 7ish and then got a call from my boyf saying I'd locked him out because he didn't take a key (we have spares next to the door).

When I answered, I was quite rude saying 'Why haven't you taken a key?!'. The tone was rude (according to my boyfriend). He felt I was rude back, he says it was because I started the conversation in such a tone.

He is adamant its my fault since I should have thought on when I saw his keys in the door. I maintain that having slept less than an hour all night, I was half dead leaving the house so didn't notice. I also want to point out that when ever we pop out to the shop next door or for a run, he insists on locking up so why is this any different? I've stuck to his rules?!! 

He has been going to the gym at this time, nearly every day during the week for 3 months and not taken a key once. The times we have gone together he has insisted on locking the door. The other times, I've been asleep and have no idea that he has not taken a key.

At first I asked for a different seat, even in economy cabin if no seat was available in business. But the flight was over sold. I tried adjusting the air conditioning to blow directly in my face, spritzing some eau de toilette on a napkin and holding it to my nose. I could still smell the BO.

27186,34362,"WIBTA If I didn’t go to my nephews Bday Party because I hate his moms BF?. My nephew is turning 3 tomorrow, having a birthday party this upcoming weekend. I absolutely love him, his baby sister, and his mother (my SIL). I would do anything for them. 

HOWEVER, my SIL is eating a piece of work and has been since about two months after my nephew was born. This man is also the father of their daughter, my niece. I literally can’t stand him.

Here’s a few reasons why:
He is controlling and selfish, manipulative and abusive. He always has been and we have tried to get him away from her but she is young (21) and doesn’t really know how to handle men or do what’s best for herself. I say that with love, I know it sounds condescending but I swear I don’t mean it that way. When she became pregnant with their daughter she did not want to keep it, he talked her into it and then once she was about 4 months pregnant he literally just left. He said he got his own apartment and took off. Then she found out he’d been cheating and she had an STD. This guy was MIA the whole pregnancy, then her father passed away and she got a pretty hefty insurance check. Guess who showed up and wanted to be involved again as soon as the check came around. 

ANYWAYS, that’s just the tip of the iceberg but you get the gist. Not a great guy. Him and I got into a pretty big argument a few weeks back when he refused to give her their daughter for an outing she’d been planning for a few days. She begged me to help get the baby. The cops came, it was dramatic. I said I’m done dealing with him and I don’t need that in my life, if she wants to put up with it that’s fine but I’m tired of helping her when things go south and her running back. 

NOW, she’s throwing a bday party for our nephew and said she knows nobody likes her BF but that she doesn’t want to do two separate parties (which I understand) so he will be there. 

I do not want to go, I don’t want to take my kids, but I told my husband if he wanted to go and take them that would be fine. I just don’t want to be around this guy or have anything pop off because of the tension and ruin a birthday party. I know the party is about my nephew, I know.

Indoor bar sucks. It’s summer and the outdoor bar has a pool, all the customers and is much larger.  Tiki bartenders make 2-300$ more nightly then indoor bartenders, and the indoor bartenders have always been our weaker staff.

I’ve repeatedly asked my bar manager why I am being scheduled indoors, stated that I’m unhappy, etc. and she claims she will fix it, sides with me, and that it’s not fair. After a month of this, I took it up with the owner and asked why I am not being scheduled at the Tiki bar. 

He comes out and says, to be honest with you.. how long are you going to be breastfeeding.  I said I don’t know... he says that I can’t be outdoors because they’re busier and he can’t allow me to leave to go pump during my shift.  I explained to him that I understood his concerns but it sucks, and I would never leave a crowded bar.  It doesn’t just work like that where you can turn off lactation.  If I don’t pump i am at risk for clogged ducts, physical pain, mastitis.  When I’ve been busy indoors I have gone 6-7 hours without pumping and have never left the bar when it’s busy.

Three days ago, I came back from a two week medical leave, during which I underwent a pretty major surgical procedure. 

Yesterday I closed after coming in early. I worked 11 hours and left at 11:45pm. Today I open and got there at 5:45am. I got about three hours of sleep. 

Today, I was supposed to leave at 3:00pm. I left at 4:30, which is fine. I don’t mind staying for extra hours. However, I was tired and was starting to hurt, especially the area of my body that is healing. 

The first night server was supposed to come in at 3. She didn’t, saying she gave her shift to another server. That second server claimed the opposite. I spent the last hour of my shift trying to get someone to come in. 

The 4 o’clock server came in. I got her set up on the floor. She’s served alone plenty of times. When the night lead came in, I got him, the cook, and the dish person set up in the back of house. The night lead just started closing by himself. He closed by himself the whole time I was on leave. 

After making sure everyone was okay, and that another server would be there shortly, I left. Everyone assured me that they were fine. I told the night lead that I would come back later that night if he needed me. I just wanted to shower and re-apply the bandages I have to wear. 

Apparently, in the hour it took the other server to come in, the one server got overwhelmed. I guess at one point they locked the door to recover themselves, and someone called corporate. 

We have a third lead, who refused to come in because the NASCAR race was on. Our general manager had his kids, and said he could come in after 9. So I got back in my car to return to the restaurant, only to be told they ultimately got it under control and no longer needed the extra hand.

I am a female, living with four other females (it was supposed to be five others, but fifth girl dropped out before semester started). There's four bedrooms and two bathrooms. I am the only one sharing a bedroom. I would like to say that most of us are pretty smart, all but one of us is going into a medical or stem profession, and the last girl is really sweet.

So, splitting two bathrooms between five people isn't the easiest thing in the world, but we split it up so that the smaller one would go to two of them, and the larger bathroom would be shared between the other three of us. Cool, it's worked since we moved here in August. We have monthly dorm inspections by our RA to make sure we aren't living in absolute filth or breaking school property. Understandable! I like to keep a clean home regardless, so between class and work, I don't mind tidying up a little. We had a mandatory roommate agreement/contract that is supposed to break up all the responsibilities, but if something is lacking, I'll usually do it anyway. I'm not a germophobe or OCD by any means, I just really, really like things clean.

However, this is where things go awry. Last Sunday (so, a week ago now) I started to come down very, very sick and I'm still trying to get better. In the last seven days I haven't gone to work, haven't attended more than maybe two classes (bad idea anyway) and have barely eaten. I went to urgent care, got medication, and was told to rest, keep hydrated, and try and get my fever down. Well, I'm one to take medical advice though I didn't need to be told to rest twice. In this week of being sick, nothing has gotten cleaned. At all.

The bathroom that I share with two other girls REEKS of urine and there's hair (that isn't mine based on color) everywhere, on the floor, in the shower, etc. The sink is piled high full of dishes, the living room carpet is full of crumbs. Nothing is getting done around here and I feel like I'm living in squalor even though I'm still way too physically weak to do the deep cleaning necessary. I would have hoped that everyone else would pitch in, but no dice.

Basically, AITA for leaving these chores to my four other (adult) roommates to do in a dorm we all inhabit while I battle being sick? Sorry if this is rambley, I've been mostly surviving on cough meds and Gatorade today.. Am I the asshole?",NTA.

Anyways, for as long as I (M20) can remember I have hated my birthday. I dont know what it is exactly but I'm pretty reserved and dont like attention so I'm sure that's most of it. Every year I ask my family if we can do nothing for it, and every year I am told to stop ""being difficult"" and then they do what they want. 

This year my parents are semi-recently divorced (couple of months) and now it's just my mother getting on me about it. I've been a little nicer about it this year because she has been feeling down but I am still asking that nothing be done. I'd still go home to see everyone but I just dont want anything else to be done.

34795,43852,"WIBTA if I took a vacation day after serving three days of jury duty?. So I'll try to make this simple and short, basically I got picked to serve a jury and we're going into our third day of trial tomorrow, well I'm usually off on Sunday's and Tuesday's. Now, I did get my regular Sunday off but as far as Monday, Tuesday, and most likely Wednesday (tomorrow) I will have spent the entire day at the courthouse. Today was a complete waste as I literally spent ALL DAY at the courthouse. From 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, and I have to get up tomorrow morning and do it again.

So I was considering burning a vacation day for Thursday, so I could just have a regular day off to kind of make up for the fact that my regular scheduled day off was wasted spending it at the courthouse. I somewhat feel a bit scummy doing it because I've missed the last four days of work with Sunday and Tuesday being my regular days off, but as I said today was a complete waste and I didn't really have a ""true"" day off as it was spent in court. I feel like my boss will either not approve or have some kind of disdain for me if I was to not come in on Thursday, but at the same time I didn't choose to get picked for a jury. I just think it makes sense that I don't enjoy spending my whole day at the courthouse and would like to have a ""regular"" day off where I could get some things done instead of spending my regularly scheduled day off at the courthouse.

I order delivery every once in a while and usually I have them call when they're outside and then I walk down to the lobby and grab my food. Never been an issue.

51351,64416,"AITA for Not Hiring a Woman Based on Her Current Sexual Harassment Claims Against A Former Employer?. I'm a manager for a mid-sized tech company and there was this one candidate we interviewed who had a gap (about a year) in her employment history. When questioned about it, she said she was doing 'odd-jobs' to make ends meet while she transitioned from her old, stable job. Fair enough, not everyone can find a permanent position and we all gotta eat. She seemed likeable enough during the interview and there wasn't anything that stood out that was screaming red flags at me, so we put her down as a potential hire along with 3 other people. I ask if we can contact those 'odd-job' places, as part of my due diligence, but she declines to provide references from them, saying they were one-time jobs as commissioned work.

I contact her previous employer from the references she did give (Company A), and they seem to like her, noting down they were sorry to see her go to 'Company B'. I'm pretty sure that was an over-share on her previous manager's part, but I make a note of it because I have a friend who works in 'Company B'.

I contact my friend and he does a verbal double-take and asks if it's so-and-so. I provide a brief physical description and the revelation seemed to blow his mind. He goes on a long-winded rant about how she turned her department upside-down with a legal case regarding allegations of sexual harassment to her former employer. It appears she quit her job (apparently without notice), then came back with a harassment claim that got kicked to their legal team and is currently in arbitration. Her department at Company B is in disarray as people try to cover her sudden departure and the subsequent scandal is tanking office morale. She was also working there for 8-months straight so it appeared she outright lied on her job interview to my face.

I take this information to HR and they say this is not a hiring criteria nor is it a disqualifying one. They strongly suggested I never bring this up again. Then they hinted that I hire the best candidate based on what value they bring to the company and that minimizing liability is part of that value. I took the hint and left.

Even though I personally see it as unfair, if it was a man accusing his previous employers of sexual harassment, or launching a law suit against them for any other reason, I would still view them as a liability. Given how my friend described the poor state of things from her previous job, I see no reason to hire this woman as opposed to the other 3 potential candidates.

Alright Reddit, AITA for not hiring this woman?. Am I the asshole?","YTA-your decision would be considered retaliatory and your friend from company b just gave a retaliatory reference.

Most of our friendship has been long distance since her family moved out of state. We have been there for each other through everything...well up until recently. 

As adults, our friendship went from talking every day to maybe once a week at most. When we do talk, it's always very one-sided and she talks for most of the phone call. When it's my turn, she always seems disinterested. For instance, I was talking to my sister about this very issue and the friend texted me saying we could try to talk. I was excited and talked a lot, but she was silent or preoccupied so I felt like an ass by the end of the call, which lasted about 10 minutes. I wouldn't be so sad about it, except she only will talk to me when shes driving home from work. She won't call on the weekends or evenings. She won't have a conversation through text, most of the time if I text her I dont get a response at all. Even when I have gone through some serious mental health problems, she still didn't put forth any effort to reach out, it was all me. I don't usually reach out after work or on the weekend anymore, she has a 6 month old and I know that must be time consuming. But now I dont really reach out at all. I feel like I'm having to force a one-sided friendship. I wonder if maybe it's time to go our own ways, but I feel like a total asshole for it.

I went to one of my favourite sausage restaurants that have an abundance of sausage options from vegan to wild game including one of my favourites. It is the type of restaurant where you go to a counter and order and then take a number back to a table and wait for your food. I live in a country where tipping is customary and since you order and pay in advance, and in prompted for a tip, I added a 10% tip. These are over priced sausages and sides and some toppings are extra so it was a decent tip. One of my favourite toppings is melted raclette cheese on top. If you get the chance to try it, I highly recommended. 

On this particular visit to this particular location, I asked for mine with cheese on top and paid for my and a couple of colleagues as well (my turn to buy lunch). It was fairly busy but we patiently waited. When it finally arrived I asked where my cheese was (as well as for one of my colleagues). They took the order back and the cashier came back with a portable debit machine and a copy of our itemized receipt which was never given to us originally. She then advised that we never paid for the cheese and we would have to pay extra for it. It was what we came for and it's true that we didn't pay for it, but it was the cashiers error for not punching it in. I agreed to pay for it and then noted that the machine asked for a tip again. Of course I didn't tip again, but it occured to me that if they made a mistake and can charge me extra, then I clearly made a mistake on tipping for service i assumed would be better and should ask for maybe original tip to be returned. I didn't do it because I am not very confrontational, but my colleagues were split on if I should have.

64227,80585,"WIBTA reporting people illegally parked in my apartment complex's garage?. Background: my roommate was towed not too long ago from our private parking garage for having expired registration. She works from home, doesnt use her car alot, so she didnt even notice. Is that her bad? Yea, sure... but the complex hired these guys to come scope the parking garage for infractions, and they didnt even bother to leave a notice on her door saying it has been towed, so she just walked out to find her car gone, which caused a fair amount of initial panic. All said and done, it cost her like $450 to get her car back and she was really upset about it.

The clause in our lease says 'any infractions may be towed'... but EVERY SINGLE NIGHT I come home, people are parked illegally all over this garage. They park across the white lines, that clearly are loading spaces and not parking spots. One asshole BMW parks every single night across the while lines right in front of the entrance to the apartment on my floor. Does this hurt me? No... it just annoys the ever living fuck out of me, because there are always spots open on other levels which I go to park in, these people are just entitled assholes who are too lazy to walk down a floor to their level after parking.

I am of the mind at this point to go down to the managing office, and ask them why the fuck they towed my roommate over her expired registration, which disrupts nothing in the complex, but they consistently do fuck all about the people parking like asshats everywhere every night.

Also, it seems like a really shady practice. I know the tow company must get a percentage from them throwing their own residents under the bus... so the only reason I would think they tow certain cars for certain infractions over others is that its more profitable to do so.

Connor’s brother hosted a dinner for the couple last weekend and I was one of those who were asked to make a toast. I said that I’m glad that Lisa came into Connor’s life.

When he met Lisa he told me how easily he found it to talk to her, which was why he asked her out immediately. I said that just a month after they started dating Connor told me that being with Lisa made him the happiest that he has ever been in a long time and he really felt like she was the one. I thanked Lisa for making one of the kindest and most caring people I know happy and wished them a long and lasting marriage.

Now, I’m a reasonably successful professional and have a much better relationship with the family. Everyone thought I would end up on welfare, but I turned my life around. Sure, what I substituted it with may not be ideal, but it’s a trade I’m willing to live with.

I flipped out because I was scared of what I thought she was pushing me towards, scared at the possibility of returning to that life. It scares me so much because of how it creeps up on you. Losing control is a gradual process that you can’t see until it’s too late and has already fucked your life up. We’ve since mended things and understand each other’s perspectives better, but I still feel bad for overreacting. What’s your verdict, AITA?

TL;DR: got into bad fight with girlfriend because she was concerned my bodybuilding hobby is excessive. I flipped out at her because bodybuilding is a major factor in controlling my substance problems (predominantly alcohol), and I’m deathly afraid of losing control to alcohol again. We talked and are all good, but I still feel bad about it..

3282,4065,"AITA for being mad that I have to host a family gathering?. So I live with my mother for financial reasons and for the holidays she decided to invite her brother and his family over. 

For some context, my uncle is in his 70s, his kids are about 15-20 years older than me and their kids are all like half my age or younger (I’m 30). 

Now we normally host during the holidays because we have one of the bigger homes. I buy and cook all the food (my mom doesn’t cook) and do 90% of the house cleaning/prep (my mom is older and can’t really do heavy house work) I am 100% okay with this arrangement because our family is usually only about 6 people max during a gathering and it takes a lot of stress off my mom during an already stressful time of year.

This gathering is going to be 13 people (7 of which are virtual strangers to me) because my cousins are so much older than me, I have 0 memories of them, and have only met half the kids and those I did meet were only once. 

My mother has said she will take care of the food and I only have to worry about myself (I’m a vegetarian). She is going to buy a precooked ham for everyone. No mention of any other food, sides or desserts. The thing is, I’m not the only vegetarian coming. I know that there are 2 other vegetarians and mom mentioned that several others don’t like to eat meat. So now it’s looking like half the group are vegetarians so I won’t be cooking for just me. 

This is also happening 2 days after our normal Christmas gathering that I’m having to cook/prep for. 

My mother also mentioned that because my cousins’ kids are all coming (I think 4 in total) that I will be expected to set up my playstion for them. This I absolutely put my food down on and said no way. I don’t care if these kids are family. They are not going to be playing around in my room while I’m not there to supervise. And even if I was, I should be able to expect my privacy in my own room and not be expected to babysit a bunch of kids. 

I know these people are family but honestly I’m pretty pissed that I’m going to have to play host to virtual strangers. My mom says she will handle it, but she’s not a young woman and if I don’t step in, she’s going to over work herself just trying to prep the house and won’t be able to cook or anything. So I’ll end up having to play host and entertain these people.

56995,71584,"AITA for not letting my sister's niece and nephew use my Netflix account because they were being rude?. I'll start of by giving a little history to this incident. I basically allow my sister and her mother in law to use my Netflix account as her mother in law has been nice to me and treats me like family ever since my parents passed away.

A few days ago my sister's brother in law comes back to town while I was over at my sister's place. The kids were using my Netflix account during the day. Later in the afternoon they went out and so I used the TV to watch some shows. 

When the kids came back they insisted I get off the TV and let them resume their show. I told them I was still watching something and told them to wait but they kept pestering me every 5 minutes and kept demanding I switch back to their cartoons. 

This time I told them that they were using my account and should be respectful as I could take away their access if I wanted to. My sister sided with them and insisted I let them watch their show. Funnily enough, in that moment my Netflix account experienced an error and kicked us off the account. My sister assumed I removed access and lightly accused me of not wanting the kids to use my account. 

She asked me to leave her house so I went home. When I got home the account worked again so she realized I had not kicked them off my account but I decided to discuss the issue with her. I told her I did not kick them off but I could have done it if the kids were going to continue disrespecting me. My sister believes I should have just brushed of their bad bahavior. She also accused me of being childish. I on the other hand felt that she was rewarding their bad behavior.

44037,55299,"AITA for going back on a promise/unpaid commission because of how the requester/s behaved?. I wrote fanfiction while I was in high school and it had become semi-popular, as it was during the stage where fanfiction was all the rage. 

Now I had written a piece back in 2011 and gave up on it around 2015-16. I had written an author's note stating I wasn't going to be picking it back up. 

I didn't have the motivation to continue and I had just started university. Traction died down and I finally put it behind me.

Now two month ago I had received a PM from a random person requesting an extra chapter for that discontinued fic because their younger sisters loved it and their read it to them in bed, they were going through a hard time and wanted something to cheer them up. It was SFW and the request was pretty wholesome. So I agreed. 

They had even offered to pay me to do it but I declined knowing that I was flippant about continuing it in first place. 

I had told them I was in the middle of doing exams and to not contact me again until XY date when all my exams would be finished, I specified I needed to study and I needed a remind (I'm pretty forgetful) and then I can open up time to really nail it out. 

Now while I was in the middle of stressing out and studying like crazy I kept receiving messages from them around the same time and they were getting weirder and weirder.

They claimed to be from Japan but the time they messaged me was always around 2-3am. The surprise chapter for the sisters was immediately discovered when they ""stole his phone"" and started texting me in Japanese. I was further skeptical as the guy told me they were around 4-8 years old. 

They were using Kajin (Chinese characters) when usually kids around their age would limit themselves to the basic alphabets. 

A little off topic but I was as suspicious until my exams were almost over and then I received a messaging saying the girls were in a bus accident and in the hospital in life threatening condition. Bit weird that they would text me of all people about an accident but whatever. Then the sister texts me (in English) claiming their brother (the original texter) was in a car accident, a day later said he died. 

I've been suspicious of all of these text for a while and decided to ignore them. I feel incredibly guilty because I made a promise to do the commission despite it being unpaid but at the same time because I didn't take their money cause I had a funny feeling, their claims felt so bogus and ridiculously coincidental that I told myself I shouldn't let myself get baited by trolls or someone demanding context dishonestly and who will likely continue to do it if I were to give in.

Now, normally I head over there at around 8:00 in the morning.  but my brother wants to start getting to school at 6:45 am so I have to leave way earlier. I usually go to bed around 9 to 10 and because I had to wake up earlier I wasn't able to get as much as sleep and was tired when I got my grandparents house.

&#x200B;

Now normally I make my own breakfast or my grandma goes out and gets something to eat real quick. I always pay her back if she does go get something to eat. Now my grandpa is bedridden and cannot move a single limb on his own. He has Alzheimers and Dementia. My uncle also lives with my grandma because he never really moved out and when he did my grandparents were getting old so he moved back so if both of them were in trouble he could do something about it.

Anyways, I would like to point out that I have been helping my grandmother with my grandfather for almost 3 years now. So I get to my grandmothers' house pretty tired just to the point where I just cannot keep my eyes open and fell asleep. My grandmother got enraged at this for some reason, calling me a son of a bitch because I was asleep while she was calling me for the help that she normally does. And I just told her I don't really want to do this I am really tired right now and need to catch up on my sleep. She was furious, and called me a lazy piece of shit. I told her My uncle could help her. I normally help with cleaning up my grandpa and turning so he doesn't get bedsores, now I don't think that this is exactly the worst thing in the world, and because he is my grandpa I will do it.

The thing that made me angry was the fact that everything that I have done for her in the past 3 years was thrown out the window because I needed to sleep just once. I was pissed at first, but I've since calmed down. Another thing that I have now started to notice is she doesn't even know me anymore, about a couple hours later she went out to the store and got some groceries, and she came back with fucking mc Donalds. I am not mad at the fact that it was mc Donalds I'm mad because she brought food in general, and if she really knew me then she would've known that a simple apology would have been sufficient.

Different university, same city. I take a 10 min bus and 30 min train to go see him on the weekends. We’ve already had a little disagreement about this because he would prefer I only stay one night so he can ‘sleep good before uni the next day’. So I agreed, but it is irritating since I have to travel a fair bit just to see him for half a day and one night. Anyway, he is now saying that I should pay him £5 a week for the food I eat while I am at his. I already spend £5 a week on the travel to come see him which he does not put any money towards and refuses to make the trip to mine, so I pay this £5 literally every week. Most of the food I eat at his is stuff he already has in like cereal or we eat out, all he has to buy is one main meal and sometimes not even that (like I said sometimes we eat out). I said I shouldn’t have to pay for food because it just evens out the money I pay in travel. His excuse is that I don’t have to pay as much rent as him so I should have more money.

I put in a resume at a local social service agency last week and got a call back two days later. The founder/president of the organization and I spoke for about 20 minutes and at the end she enthusiastically asked about my availability and said verbatim, “I’d like to have you come in for an interview.” 

I said my schedule was very flexible so she said she’d send me a few dates the same day via email. 

I usually email the person I spoke with to thank them for their time but opted to wait since she said she’d email me. No email came that day. Or the next day, or the next day. 

Finally on the third day I emailed thanking her for her time and asked, “please let me know if you’re still interested in setting up an in person interview.” She emailed back quickly saying “I will let you know.” I took that more as “I’ll let you know if I’m still interested,” not “I’ll let you know about my schedule.” Nothing else since then. 

It’s now been a week since the phone interview and I finally get a brief email saying that “you are not qualified.” I meet about 75% of their listing requirements.

I’m a hiring manager at my current position and conduct hiring every three-five months. I train my assistant, who handles phone screenings, to never tell someone that they would be getting an in-person interview, but that someone would be in touch if they are moving forward in the process, which I thought is standard. 

I feel like it was very unprofessional for her to ask my availability, tell me she wants me to interview, never reach out to me, and then give that short response when I email her. But at the same time, I understand that it’s her agency and she can do what she wants. 

My question is: would it be appropriate/worth it for me to email back to tactfully let them know that setting up an interview with someone and then changing their mind but not reaching back out isn’t best practice when hiring?

I said to my brother ""I'll go, can you watch the dinner? You don't need to touch it or do anything to it, just make sure it doesn't burn and maybe give it a stir"". The store is at the end of the road, I was there and back in less than 5 mins. 

In the 5 mins I was gone, mum came in, relieved my brother of his duties, and added a buttload of pepper, salt and tumeric. There was already pepper in there, so now it's got way too much, there's loads of salt (the salt cellar was half full earlier and is now nearly empty), and IDK why she thought tumeric would go in a pasta dish, but the sauce was completely ruined. My brother says he told her not to mess with it, but stir it if it needs stirring.

She does stuff like this all the time and she's really heavy handed with seasoning, and even on the night I am meant to have total control of the kitchen she still comes in and messes with the food (changing oven temp, adding herbs, even throwing out stuff that I'm using (she threw out 3 chicken breasts once because ""I thought we agreed on beef"")). 

Mum left the kitchen, I went to make another sauce, and then she came back in and saw the first sauce put on the side. She asked why and I just said ""too much pepper"". She then went on a rant about how she tried to do something nice and make it better, and I was being ungrateful. She said she did it to help, she wasn't being malicious or trying to sabotage it or anything, and everything she did it was to help me. My little brother said I should have just used her sauce, but it really did taste bad.

Girlfriend of 2 years is upset with me regularly for not initiating getting together with her 2 kids and my son for activities. Though I have invited her and her kids multiple times to family get togethers, dinners and she refused, saying that her older son was “unpredictable” in his behavior (joys of an angry teen in the mix), as well this was the excuse last year at my bday party she refused to come over and I did not see her until later that week. Usually when we have our kids every other weekend, we may spend a dinner or a day together but not always since her kids play sports.





**Actual AITA:**

Memorial Day weekend comes Friday we cannot get together my son planned a sleep over. Saturday my son and I are not doing anything and Sunday night I have a dinner with my family. Girlfriend was invited Saturday to her son’s coaches camp where there is a bunch of kids and they would all play together, everything from kickball, pool, basketball, manhunt etc. Girlfriend doesn’t ask if my son and I can go even though coaches know we are dating and according to her even ask about me.  I think this would be a great something for all our kids to have done together. They are out all night, there was a band at the camp community center and didn’t get home (we live separate) till after midnight. Sunday comes around and she had decided to throw a Memorial Day party and invite all the basketball kids and their families over to her house for swimming, basketball, cornhole, tag, etc. from 1pm to 7pm.

Usually when everyone comes over, they're all engaged and have fun, but one of my friends always seems to be on his phone.

49754,62432,"AITA for not spending time with my parents?. I'm currently 17 turing 18 in January next year which is the legal age in my county 

For the past year I've been volunteering at the local youth center, helping out when it's needed but mostly just chilling with my friends. This has recently led to me getting a key to the place so I can hang out with a couple of friends or just watching a movie after closing hours. 

Me not really liking it at home, and not really having anything to do there has made me spending more and more time at the youth house, usually coming home at around 10.30 pm. on weekdays and late at night on weekends.

My parents are fine, they're caring and nice so I don't have a direct problem with them. It's just that when I'm at home all I do is watching movies or playing guitar in my room so I'm not being social with my parents anyway. And all of these things I can do at the youth house but with friends instead. Anyhow me not being home almost at all during weekdays has made them really passive aggressive towards me and me not being home. Like I understand that I'm their kid and the youngest of my siblings who has all already moved out so they surely feel kinda bad that I'm ""leaving the nest"" so soon. 

But me being able to have something with my own and with my friends has been a huge upswing in my life. A couple of years ago I didn't really have any friends outside of school that I could hang out with so I spend almost all of my free time at home playing videogames. During that time my parents would complain that I didn't do anything else and that I should go out and see friends and not be so fixated at home. Now it's the complete opposite and they want me at home instead. I'm also mentally feeling much better today then a couple of years ago. I feel like my life finally has a meaning and I've found something that I'm actually invested in and want to spend time doing. 

And no the youth house is having a zero tolerance on drugs so it's not anything unhealthy we are doing. Just hanging out. And my grades are not getting damaged either, I can study significantly better there than at home and I don't go to bed later that usual.

62395,78294,"AITA for telling my sister she is overreacting to her ""heartbreak""?. This is about my older sister.

The scene: my sister had made this  new friend, and they apparently hit it off well. They hung out a few times and she thought he was a very fun guy. She started to *like* like him, but they still were just friends and I'm not sure if he liked her back.

My sister tends to be very insecure in friendships. She feels like she can't be sure whether someone actually likes to hang out with her, or if they want to hang out another time, that kind of stuff. I get that, I have that too.

Problem with my sister, however, is that she brings these insecurities up, and not always in a good way.

So what happened here: last time they hung out, she had made some comments already about her insecurities, and about ghosting, and when they parted ways she thought it a good idea to make a joke (at least she said she brought it in a joking manner) about him ghosting her. Something along the lines of “oh, you're not gonna ghost me, are you?”

Well, he obviously didn't like that, because the next day he texted her about it. He started about the joke, and her response was explaining why she had said it (not apologizing for it or something). He went on to say that he felt like her insecurities stood between their friendship and some other things. Her responses were still trying to explain herself, and sometimes attacking him. No swearing or choice words were used. It ended in him blocking her on whatsapp and facebook. 

I thought it was a shitty and childish to do of him, but also felt like my sister should/could have handled it better.

I'd have thought, well, he doesn't want to have to do anything with me, I'll have to let him go. She didn't. A week later she was still very, very upset. I then already felt like she was overreacting a bit, but whatever. She wants self pity, she can have it. I did support her and comforted her, though.

Skip to now. It’s been 4 weeks, if not more, since this whole ordeal happened and she is still very upset. I would have just found it quite annoying, and I would have probably just grumbled to my younger sister about it (not the upset sister), but yesterday she came home and started telling me that she had told everyone about what this guy did and reading them his texts to her. She went on to say that she had hoped that she would see him today at the university, because she wanted to confront him about blocking her, and about his messages.

I told her I didn't think it was so smart to tell all these other people about this, and that she should just let it and him go. I also told her I felt she was overreacting.

She did not take that well.

AITA?. Am I the asshole?",NTA but using the word overreacting may of not been the best way to phrase it. You sister sounds like one of those people that end up pushing people away because of their insecurity. You know they aren't a bad person but it can just be overbearing at times.,0,0,0,0,1

I never really cared beyond Star Wars, but whatever, it's a bit weird but usually fine. This person however, who is almost a decade older than me, mind you - basically bombards our friend group with these god awful fanfic stories and OC's.

Honestly, I find all that fan created stuff pretty cringey in general, but this stuff, in all sense of the words, just *sucks.* It's mostly generic ""angel/demons"", genderswapped ""retellings"" and painfully edgy, alternatively cutesy shit.

So I told them they were being immature for no reason because I wasn't going to leave to my room (I don't have a widescreen there).

My brother's friend replied, you're only grossed out because it's a pussy. I guess he meant because I'm bi and he thinks that means gay. I was annoyed at this point and said, I'm not grossed out by pussies, why would I be, I have one myself but a little lower.

My family is very large and has a family reunion every few years at a resort/state park where we rent out several conference rooms and a large portion of the available lodging for a week. Part of the tradition is that the organizers post a massive family tree that spans the walls of the main conference room that is rented. It's really impressive to see the whole family mapped out on such a large scale!

At the last reunion, I was checking out the family tree and noticed my cousin's deadname was used. I have lots of trans friends and know how upsetting it can be for them to be deadnamed, so I quickly just took a pencil and corrected it. NOTE that at this point in time my cousin was out to the family so I wasn't outing them. I'm not sure if the person who created the family tree was purposefully deadnaming my cousin or just made a mistake, but my family is fairly conservative so I honestly wouldn't be too surprised if it was purposeful.

He said that I overstepped my boundaries and that if my cousin or his family wanted it corrected, it was up to them.

Me and my bf cherish each other and I've never felt happier, I believe this is the man my father will give me away to.
I believe we feel same way as we comment on idea and dumb kid names, and us holding hands as old crippled grandparents etc.

I have one best friend (M23) who he hasn't gotten on with. He would like to make minor comments about him and I ignored them, then they kinda grew so I just always never went out drinking with them together through our relationship.

Eg comment: I was mentioning he couldn't come out to meet me and hang because he broke his foot, ""oh good"" he responded.

I am going out with my uni friends to drink socially with  my bf, who gets on with them all very well they even ask often about him and greet him pleasently.

But some drama begins with my bff and I that stirred up issues so I said we will trade pints and mend it with a good catch up chat.

Mentioning it later to my bf he got kinda upset to hear he would be there, then later in call said he didn't want to talk about it and just wanted to end out call on good note. He hasn't pasted a comment since.

Later, he said he didn't want to go out that night because I'd be gone from group (for approx 20mins) having drinks with my mate. Which I will be in the same bar/at the same table to side. And he would be with he mates/my uni friends.

Prestory: when I was first with bf he was coming to a bar I was at, where me and my bff were chatting. I was just single and he was trying his luck and had his arm extended near me. So my bf saw this. I saw him jumped up with glee and kissed him Infront of my bff(kinda drunk) I was happy for them to meet. But my bff left in a huff and me and bf went elsewhere.

I claim he was just chatting but my bf thinks he was trying luck, and now I believe so too. I've told him since beginning I've only had eyes for him and love him unconditionally, so my bf looks down at him (bff) now.

I'm aware my bf gets a little jealous but I really love him and am kinda all over him in the purest way in public like holding hands or leaning my head on him in bus etc.

23797,30167,"WIBTA / WWBTA if me and my family didn’t follow my vet’s advice?. I know this might get tense since it involves taking care of a pet, which everyone has their own opinion on, but here we go. 

Context: 

My dog is 15 years old. We’ve had her since she was a puppy and my mom is incredibly devoted to her. 
Lately, due to her age, we’ve been taking her to the vet more frequently. On top of that we are applying ointments to her paws,  giving her prescribed medications, have her on a special diet, etc. She’s not so sick that she’d need to be put down, but I would be lying if I said that our family wasn’t mentally preparing for that. 

What Happened at the Vet:

The dog has some rough patches of skin, and her hair is falling out in some places. This is fairly recent. The vet started combing her and these rough patches started bleeding. She then took a sample of skin from one of these patches to test for bacteria, and said that there might be bacteria on her skin. Then she asked how often we give her baths. My mom said “we don’t give her baths” (she is a beagle/mixed breed dog, so she generally keeps herself clean). 

The vet acted like she was about to call the humane society she was so incredulous: “you NEVER bathe her?!” My mom told her that we use dry shampoo and brush it into her fur when she needs it and otherwise she keeps herself clean by rolling in the snow and playing in the hose— if she is filthy, obviously we will make sure that she gets clean enough to be comfortable. 

The vet wants us to bathe her three times a week. She is 15 and has never had a bathing routine, and now she wants us to bathe her three times a week. 

During the appointment, my mom also brought up some of her general health and mobility issues and her old age, saying that we were starting to think about putting her down, and  the vet implied that she was selfish for thinking about “euthanasia”. 

I would be prepared to help out with her baths, if it feels like the right thing to do and if it’s best for the dog. It just seems bathing our dog would make her much more uncomfortable than she already is. The vet says she’s really itchy, but that was after she brushed her and scratched her skin patches. I don’t know. 

TL;DR Would we be the assholes if we didn’t give our 15 year old beagle mix thrice weekly baths as was prescribed by our vet? I’m more concerned about the dog than about whether we are assholes, but I’m still hoping to get some feedback about the situation. Thanks reddit.. Am I the asshole?","YTA. Even tho you might think that you know your dog the best, a vet is someone who studied years to be qualified to do what he's doing, and has seen thousands of other animals with similar problems.

Even if beagles do tend to keep themselves clean, this becomes harder due to old age. Regular baths could indeed help a lot with her skin problems.

Anyway, my point is: follow the advices of those more qualified than you. Not doing so would be like going to your doctor, getting prescribed medicines but not taking them because ""nah, I know what's best for me!""

If you're so concerned about the advice received, maybe go to a different vet to hear a second opinion, but don't just ignore that",1,1,0,0,0
18044,22959,"AITA for deciding to cut out a friend because I felt shunned by her?.  It started 6 months ago, this friend I've known for 20 years started to shun me for no apparent reason. After she cancelled on a staycation a mutual friend and I were planning for her birthday (citing family commitments), she kind of stopped responding in the group chat. In the months that followed, she went silent, though there were occasional social media posts; and she was still posting active on her cats’ Instagram account.

&#x200B;

For some reason, I got increasingly annoyed because I felt non-existent to her; she did not text me when I went on my solo trip overseas, despite sharing the excitement months earlier. She would react to other friends' posts on social media (some who aren't even close) but not once to my posts. It almost seemed on purpose. I realized much later that her personal Instagram account was no longer following mine (no idea when it happened), but her “cats’ account” was still following mine. I told the mutual friend about this, only to be told the 'unfollowing' could've been accidental, and that I might be overthinking things. At some point I came to a conclusion that the mutual friend probably knows something was up, but just didn't want to escalate matters.

&#x200B;

Being a passive introvert, I stopped initiating communication after attempts in the group chat got zero reciprocation from her. The only exception was wishing her happy birthday, to which she replied a simple “thank you!”.  I mailed to her some gifts over Christmas, and she didn't even have the decency to let me know she received it. I only knew she received it when I recently asked the mutual friend.

&#x200B;

Despite wanting to consider that she might really be having personal difficulties and not wanting to be guilt tripped for being upset over all of this, I still eventually decided I’ve had enough.

I unfollowed her on Instagram, later also removing her ""cats account"" from my followers, and I left the WhatsApp group chat. We are still on each other's Facebook, though she hasn't posted anything in 3 months. Either that, or she has been only posting to selected audiences to view (something she has done to others before). 

&#x200B;

I left things at that, but last week I received a tracked parcel from her. It contained some items which I guess are gifts she got for me over the months and held onto, maybe waiting for a time to meet up... I don't know, maybe even thinking that is presumptuous. There was also a 'thank you' card in which she wrote ""Thanks for everything. Take Care."" Not sure what kind of context that should be interpreted though.

Receiving this now feels too little too late, and it no longer matters as much as it used to anymore.  Am I the asshole?.
