"AITA For saying my mom's coworkers husband (repeated drunk driver) should have died in his accident?. Greetings. will probably delete this post because I will be thumbed down into oblivion. Recently my mom's friend at work had a dilemma: her husband was involved in a bad car accident. Currently, he has broken ribs, dislocated shoulder, he is on breathing support etc. He is in rough shape. As it came to be, it was not just any old car accident; he was drunk at 8:17 in the morning and lost control of his car and was gravely injured. Now, after hearing my mother and sister talk about this mishap, I chimed in with a little of my two-cents. I told them that I feel he should not be alive after his accident. Him still being alive is too good for what damage he has caused in his time, as well as what could still possibly happen. For years, he has been driving drunk due to his alcoholism and has little to no regard for others around him as long as he has a cold one in his hand.  He has put his hands on his family or basically been a dead beat dad for the entirety of his children's lives. My mom informed me without being so straight forward, that it is not my place to judge. I got a little heated saying his injuries were too good for someone who drives drunk frequently and hope he learns his lesson.

Now,  I work in customer service for a phone company, and come across many men who cannot drive due to not having a license. (Have to validate cell phone accounts at work through a scan-able ID. I usually ask why they have an ID instead of a license and they usually laugh and say one too many DUI's. This infuriates me. I have family members injured by drunk drivers, friends killed, and relatives and other acquaintances who have lost loved ones due to these foolish people. It makes me think what if I would lose my family or my girlfriend due to someones poor choice. This being said, I have developed a strong prejudice against alcoholism and drunkards. Drunk drivers to me are some of the worst scum of the earth who always seem to take some of the best people from this world way before their time.

"WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend to sleep without his beloved cross necklace?. So my boyfriend has this cross necklace that he absolutely LOVES. He always wears it, except when bathing or swimming. He wears it to sleep, work out, work, lounge around, pretty much just everything. 

It used to not be a problem, before we really started sleeping together. But recently, I have started to spend the night with him a few nights a week, and it kind of interrupts my sleep. It digs into my face, not to the point where I can't sleep, but just enough to be pretty uncomfortable. I don't want to be that demanding girlfriend that makes him change his habits, but it's getting to be a bit annoying. Would I be the asshole if I asked him to not sleep with it?",did you just not sleep before you met him,1,1,0,0,0
"WIBTA if I treated my friend how she treats me for a day?. So, I have a friend. She means the world to me but she isn’t that nice. I’ll constantly show her things I think are cool, and she’ll call me childish or say she doesn’t care. Today I actually cried because of it. 

I was out of data and had a pen next to me so I doodled a bit of my hand. I thought it was a cute doodle so I showed her, and she called me a 4 year old. I got really self conscious and immediately washed it off and soon after cried a bit because she finally pushed me over the limit. I always respect what she shows me or tells me. 

Other times, I would vent to her and she would say things like ‘cool, I’m going to go play Minecraft’ (we are in our teens) and I won’t have anyone to talk to. She’s basically the only one I have. I’ve talked to her about it and she’ll ignore me and won’t stop until I apologize 

So WIBTA if I just treated her how she treated me for maybe a few hours or just a day?","YWBTA to yourself mainly if you stay friends with someone who puts you down. Don't bother trying to ""teach her a lesson,"" it won't work. Just end the friendship.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for giving my best friend a choice between me and another girl?. I've been best friends with Ricky since we were 9, and tbh I'm in love with him. He's said the same about me and we've actually kissed before, but I was super insecure and didn't want a relationship because I didn't feel pretty enough for him. 

When we got to secondary school, literally on the first day in year 7, we were in a classroom chatting. This nasty girl interrupted out conversation and began making fun of us with her friends. 

I'll call that girl Laura, and to this day she has never stopped bullying me. She knows I'll never be as gorgeous as her and loves to remind me. We're 18 and in year 13, and will hopefully be going to uni next year. 

Ricky's always stuck up for me against Laura, but the problem is his friends are friends with Laura's group, so she's often around when he's hanging around with his mates.

Laura's super smart, and studies some of the same subjects as Ricky. Recently she has offered him study help, and he has accepted because he really wants to get into his first choice. He comes back from these sessions saying she is really nice and isn't as bad as we thought. 

Thing is, Laura and her friends still pick on me all the time. He still sticks up for me, tells her to go away, literally shouts at her to get lost while she giggles (and tries to flirt with him?), yet he goes to these study sessions, and I've seen them when they chill as a group of friends, talking and laughing with her. 

I don't have many friends and don't want to lose Ricky. I love him. But I can't be friends with him while he's friends with her. I know he sticks up for me but how long will that last?

I put all of this into a text, and told him that I wouldn't continue our friendship if he was friends with her. He texted me saying that it wasn't fair to make him choose between ''two people I care about''. This upset me even more. 

I feel like I'm being jealous and insecure but Laura makes my life hell, and I feel so upset at seeing him being friends with her.","YTA. I get how it feels, and you don't need to be friends with her (or him), but by forcing him to choose despite the fact that he has constantly stood up for you makes you the asshole. You are not just making him pick between you and her, but you and all his other friends by proximity. What it sounds like is you are in love with your friend and you are scared that she will try to steal him, so you don't want them to be together at all.

"AITA for telling my dad that he smells?. Hey, so I was pretty hot headed when I said what I said and I know it's an asshole thing to say, but am I the asshole when the context is added?

I've been living with my dad for 2 years. I've been to college, been unemployed and now i'm working full time while he's working half of full time (week on week off). He's a heavy cigerette smoker. 

He smokes everywhere and the smell of his strong cigarette smoke is passed onto me. To stop this, I told my dad I appreciated him helping me out, but I also told him to stop washing my clothes, stop ironing my clothes and I want to dry my clothes in a room where he isn't smoking (he would wash and iron my clothes if they are in with his).

Before I had a job, I would do my own and it would be fine, but now that I have a job, I don't really have the time to iron all my clothes so I iron what I need when I need it. I'd accidentally leave my clothes drying too long and my dad would put them in the ironing basket. 

After a few weeks of him putting clothes into the ironing basket, they stocked up and today, he started ironing them himself. I saw him ironing my stuff and I said calmly, 
""Ah dad, sure leave my stuff, I don't need them ironed"".

He then starts shouting at me telling me he's been up for hours doing my clothes, that they're just left there and I don't have the time so he wants to help (when really he just wants to get the out of the way). 
I said ""just do your stuff, separate mine and leave them for me to put in my room so they're not in your way"".
He said he's not doing that because he can't live in a house where things are just left there (again very OCD and anxious) and he asked why I don't want him to help.

Out of frustration of telling him for months not to touch my clothes, I said ""because you smell"".
obviously he was very offended, put my shirt back into the basked and said ""Well this is the thanks I get for doing your shit, you tell me I smell""
I clarified that I meant he smells like smoke and he's aware of my issues with his smoking. 

He storms off aaaaaand SCENE. 

Am I the asshole? I feel like an asshole but I did tell him not to and he did it anyway.

TLDR; Living with dad. Dad is a heavy smoker and the smell passes onto me and my clothes. I get sick of people asking if I smoke and leaving bad impressions with people so I ask my dad to stop ironing. I leave my clothes drying for too long and my dad puts clothes in the ironing basket. After leaving the clothes for too long, my dad irons them and I tell him to leave my stuff in my room because he smells of smoke. He's extremely offended yada yada yada am I a dick?






","Yes, you're the asshole here. You live under his roof, and he's entitled to have his house the way he likes it. If he wants your clothes away within a small time of when you put them in the basket, you should work to make that happen. He shouldn't have to adjust *his* lifestyle and home life to fit around *your* priorities. It's also pretty kind and chill of him to do your laundry *for you* instead of just complaining at you. I think if you were less spoiled by the man you might appreciate that more. The smoking is a red herring. If you want to do your own laundry, do your own laundry within a time period that keeps him happy. It's really not that time-consuming.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA For doing a group project on my own and making it known to the professor?. This actually happened about a year ago but I just remembered it and wondered what other people might think. 

I'm no longer in college, but last year I was taking classes at a local community college. The class in particular was Game Design I - I'm interesting in being a game developer so was pursuing their 2 year degree in game design. The majority of the assignments outside of readings were group projects where we made board games to get a basic grip on basic game design before moving into video games specifically.

So, I get by the class fine - I skip some readings and stuff because I'm lazy but I do my best to contribute as much as I can to our projects. My group sucked, really bad. We were a 4 person group as opposed to a 5 as the majority of the class was, and half the time 2 of the people weren't even in class (they were friends or something). The other 2 people were me and this guy who was ... okay, I guess. He made a lot of distasteful jokes and hit on me the first 4 weeks of class but he wasn't like, a total dick, just really awkward and definitely nobody I would be friends with.

Anyways, fast forward to our last project. We basically have 3 weeks to make like.. the ultimate board game. Use all of the things we have learned in the class to make some thing really cool and nice. For our ""final"", we would all play each other's games and give feedback.

So - this part does make me the asshole - our entire group didn't communicate, myself included. We had a group text and each other's emails and... nobody basically.. did anything. Again, I recognize I dropped the ball here too. But SO DID EVERYONE ELSE. Somehow not a SINGLE person cared. I'm assuming everyone thought ""oh, somebody else will start getting stuff done and I'll help later"" (because I did as well), and then.. nobody did anything.

I also wanna mention I have ADHD, so I just.. totally forget about stuff. I get there's ways around this, I'm just saying it is something I struggle with, and I definitely wasn't trying to be like haha I won't help. I'm just not good at starting things. So... suddenly, it's the night the thing is due - at midnight. It was like, 5 or 6 pm. I realize, fuck, nobody has literally done ANYTHING, let alone send a text. I'm annoyed with myself, and pissed at the group that nobody else seemed to give a shit either. So I decide that in the 8 or so hours I have, I'm gonna bust my ass and make a game on the spot.

I spent the next 4 or 5 hours making a resource management based card game basically entirely in Photoshop. It was fairly simple, but I did my best to actually apply some form of game design. When it was finished, I submitted it (before the deadline) and specifically told my professor that the reason it was so bare bones was that I made it by myself, and nobody on the group helped. I acknowledged I also dropped the ball, but that I figured I could at lease salvage my own grade if these other clowns would not do it.

(I also did not go to the last day of class because I'm a pussy with bad social anxiety who did NOT want to explain to my group members why I submitted a game just for myself).

I ended the class with a low B overall, with an 87% on the project, and I never heard back from the professor on it, nor any of the group members.

Was I the asshole specifically for doing the project myself and making it clear I was the only person who did anything? It was so long ago, I doubt it matters, but I guess I'm just curious, because I always felt kind of like.. proud of myself for just powering through it and making it clear none of those clowns lifted a finger to make the finished product.

"AITA for skipping the line when getting off the airplane?. Using throwaway as my main account is tied to my work.


Let me preface by saving I am a very timid and non-confrontational guy. I was seated in the last row of a 2 hr flight. When we landed, I had a bathroom urge (no 2). I noticed that in no one was standing in the aisle for several rows in front of me.


I stood in the aisle near my row for a while but ... because of my urge I guess, I skipped to the front where other people were standing. Then I got confronted by a guy who was sitting by the row I was standing at.. and talked about protocol. I mumbled something about restroom... but he said I can use the one on the plane. I didnt have an answer.. I froze and eventually deplaned.


Then I went to the restroom, did my job and came out.. to see the guy who confronted me, who appeared to have followed me. I tried to say something but he ignored me. 


I know it is silly.. but for some reason, the incident bothers me a lot. So, aita?

This one game we were beating a bad basketball team so hard that by the 2nd quarter we put up 60 point on them. The score was 60-27 at this point. I decide to rest the starter and put in bench players. I give this freshman numerous reps. This is when the kid ask me when can he go in. He was 5'7 and 230 pounds and he was a junior. I simply replied ""I let you know"". The score was now 79-35 and it was 3rd quarter. I just didn't believe in him. He wasn't fit for this sport and he have a hard time during conditioning.

"AITA for wanting my slashed tire paid for 11 years after it happened?. Shortly after I graduated high school in 2007, I moved into an apartment complex that I lived in for about a year and a half with a roommate. In the summer of 2008, one of my car’s tires was slashed, and I never found out who did it. I had to spend $200 to get it fixed, and the whole thing really bothered me.

Flash forward to 2019. I found out just recently, through a friend I made in the apartment complex and have stayed in touch with since, that one of his friends who lived there remembered seeing a woman who lived in the complex named Emma slash my tire. Why he didn’t speak out about this earlier, I’m not sure; maybe he feared Emma targeting him. I remember Emma’s face somewhat, but never spoke to her myself and had no idea why she’d want to slash my tire.

I asked for Emma’s last name from my friend, and got it. I plugged her name into Facebook and found her profile. I shot her a message telling her that I just found out it was her who slashed my tire in 2008, and that I need her to refund me $200. She responded apologizing to me; she said she slashed the tire during a drunken rage against her boyfriend, who lived with her at the time and drove a similar-looking car to mine, causing her to mistake my car for his and slash my tire instead. She insisted she’s cut back on the drinking and tried to control her anger since then.

Emma told me, however, that she won’t be able to give me the money. She says she is now a single mother of three children, struggling financially, and that giving up that much money would be very hard on the family. “I’m sorry it happened, but it was over 10 years ago and I don’t have the money.” She said. “My apology will have to do.”

I don’t absolutely need the money. I make over $60,000 a year, and am single and childless. But extra money is always nice! I’m the kind of guy who gets childishly gleeful whenever I find a penny on the ground, so imagine how great it would be for me to get a bonus $200. $200 could easily cover the cost of a few nice dates out, a concert ticket, or a couple week’s grocery bill.

I responded to Emma telling her now that I have a screenshot of her confessing to slashing my tire, I will forward it to the police and press charges if she doesn’t give me my money. That was kind of an empty threat; I don’t think the cops will charge someone for a slashed tire after 11 years; but from looking at Emma’s Facebook page I don’t get the sense she’s the brightest bulb and that she’d probably fall for it.

After some arguing back and forth, she caved in and asked for my PO box so she could send a check; she told me it’ll be a few days since she’ll have to do some scrimping/borrowing from family to get it. My check should be on the way soon. AITA for expecting to be reimbursed for my slashed tire?","YTA.  You don't need the money, and you are willing to put the threat of police action on a single mom who can't afford to pay you.  It was 10 years ago, don't forget to calculate interest. /s

"AITA for playing matchmaker for my bff and a dude, who had a gf?. AITA: 
First timer and non native speaker disclaimer. 

So for the background: 
My (m,23) best friend (f,23) had Idiot boyfriends for as long as I have known her. Nothing horrible or abusive, but they were idiots. While you think that wouldn't necessarily affect me - since it's her relationship - that wasn't the case. 2 of them were incredibly jealous and it was annoying af. 

Fast Forward and my bestie is single. I thought I could help her a bit to finally get the great bf she deserves. I went through my friendslist and....well...most of them did not really fit the description she gave me of what she wanted from a bf. 
But one did (m,23). Perfectly. They are - in my opinion - a perfect match. 
Only problem: He had a girlfriend. 

I introduced them anyway. 
Subtly tho as I may add! 
I took her to a boardgame night at his place, went clubbing with them (and others), took her to play beachvolleyball with him and managed to get her to join his volleyball club. (Both of them really really love volleyball, as I said: perfect match). They instantly hit it of and started hanging out without me.
I never told him of my idea. I told her only after they were already friends. But to be fair I did talk him up a lot and always used him as a benchmark of how dudes should be.

Again fast forward a bit and his girlfriend broke up with him. They were already having a rocky relationship when I had my match making idea and broke up once before. 
After a few weeks my best friend and my friend got together.  (They did nothing other than hang out before the break up, no cheating involved)

I told all of this a friend of mine and she thinks I was a massive asshole to the ex-Girlfriend by introducing them. 
And since then I found out that, while not the primary reason, him hanging out with my best friend was a contributing factor to the fight that finally led to the break up.

"AITA for not deleting nude photos of my ex-girlfriend.     A couple weeks ago my girlfriend, Amanda, and I broke up. We had been together for about seven months.
If it matters, the breakup was her choice, but I understand why she made it. She said we weren't right for
each other, and she was right that the two of us had different priorities, so it's not like I harbor any anger towards
her for her choice.

    The two of us had different work schedules, which meant we didn't get to see each other as often as we would
have liked. We did exchange nude pictures as a way to keep each other ""satisfied"" when we couldn't do it in
person.

    The two of us are part of a volunteering group (that's how we met), and we have a meeting next Wednesday.
Last night, the following text conversation went down:

Amanda: I trust by now you've deleted any sensitive images you may have had of me

Me: No

Amanda: I will be checking your phone next week to make sure you have done that

Me: No need. I'm not gonna do that

    And then she got upset and started accusing me of using the pictures of blackmail. I told her I'm not gonna
share them anywhere or show anybody else. Truly, I would never do that to her or anyone. I will never show the
pictures to anybody else, and I will never try to hold them over her head for anything. I'm not keeping them out 
of spite, they are simply for my own continued enjoyment.

    Am I in the wrong here? She said she deleted the pictures she had of me, but I don't really care about that.
That was her choice, and I would've been perfectly fine if she kept them for herself. She'd already seen me naked,
so it's not like the pictures would show her anything she hadn't already seen or I hadn't already consented to her
seeing. Why should it be any different in reverse?

EDIT: Sorry about the formatting, I have no idea what I did wrong.

Also, I think what I might end up doing is copying the pictures over to my computer, deleting them from my phone, and show her next week and apologize. That way we would both be happy.","YTA. Those are sensitive pictures and if they got out could have some serious repercussions for her. Why do you need them now that you’ve broken up?

"AITA For wanting an explanation from my 'friend' in a group chat. Hello Everyone,

Throwaway here for obvious reasons but I'd like to know if I'm the Asshole in this situation, so story time. A mutual acquaintance in my friends group at University who we will call O, is hosting his 21st birthday next week on Friday. I've already RSVP'd and told others I'd be willing to be the designated driver for the event. I ended up getting a text from another friend asking if she and a friend would be able to be invited to the event and if they were able to be +2'd with me. I promptly asked O if I could +2 my friend and her friend but was told No. I told my friend that O said she and her friend couldn't come, Note: I didn't hassle or beg O to allow these two people to come. About 5 or so ish hours later my friend messages me that she asked someone else who was attending the party if she could come with them, by herself and this time, O said yes. Me being confused, I screenshotted the conversation and posted it in a group chat that O was in, mentioned him and asked him to politely explain why he said no the first time, O simply responded immediately by saying ""Its Sorted"".

"AITA For unintentionally making a girl cry on a first date?. I (23M) took this girl on a date to the movies recently, and everything was going great until our ride home. The topic of ghosts came up which she said she believes in, now I think it’s a rather silly topic and am firmly in the camp that they obviously don’t exist.

We started having a small debate if the exist or not, and one of the things I did during the debate was that I called all ghosts, spirits, demons, ect. to come haunt us both and ruin our lives, make us get into a car accident right now and kill us, if they exist. Now I said this in a jovial manner, but she just started crying her eyes out. Which shocked me. She said I took it too far, now she’s scared. When I finally got her safely, I said “ Well we’re fine, I guess that settles the debate “ which I admit was a bit of an asshole thing to say. SO AITA? For context she’s not religious at all or anything.",YTA I don’t think you understand the meaning of “unintentionally”. You intentionally both made fun of her beliefs and terrified her.,1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for asking my in-laws to leave if they felt unsafe that I have a gun?. Very simple and short story.
 
I just own a single pistol. It’s secured and in a safe place at all times. My in laws are visiting for a week. So, when they came, I gave a tour of my house. They casually asked what was in the safe. I just responded “My pistol”. Then, they got really anxious and somewhat scared. 
 
They immediately responded with that they don’t feel safe in the house since it has a gun. I just said “If you don’t feel safe, then leave”. My wife is now pretty mad at me for asking my in laws to leave, but I feel like that was taken out of context. I do believe in gun control, but I do feel safer with a gun.
 
So, AITA?","YTA. Not for having a gun but for saying that to your in-laws. Why not reassure them? Why not explain to them the safety measures you take? You're perpetuating a ""jerk with a gun"" stereotype. It is your right to own a gun if you want to. And it is your responsibility to keep it safe (which it seem you are).

I am a male and went to the party on my own. I checked with the owner of the house and they don’t own the teddy bear. I am thinking of posting on Twitter and putting the handwriting up for others up to identify (it is most likely a female’s handwriting).

"AITA for telling a friend I’m ovulating?. I have a friend who’s been struggling to conceive for about 2 years. I, on the other hand, just had a baby 2 months ago. This morning on the phone, she said that her boyfriend can’t keep his hands off her lately. I responded saying that she was lucky because I’m ovulating and my husband is getting tired of me (women typically want sex more when ovulating). She hung up on me and sent texts saying that I am insensitive because I know that she hasn’t ovulated in months and I just had a baby.

"AITA for not paying my portion of a trip with friends that I can no longer go on?. About a month ago a friend asked me about a two night weekend away with myself, my boyfriend, herself and boyfriend and her two other friends and their significant others. It’s over two weeks away at this point and I just found out I can’t go because of something work related. I tell my friend this and she insists I still need to pay my portion - including part of the deposit? I told her I don’t really feel like I should have to pay for the trip and was surprised she felt that way. For them to split it the total cost three ways would be an extra $70 per couple. We are all working professionals and I don’t see this stressing anyone out financially. Also it’s not like I’m cancelling the day before - it’s over two weeks away.

Anyway - She told me that I needed to contact all the other people coming on the trip to ask them about the additional money - even tho she’s the person that booked everything and I’ve only met them a couple times. And I have texted them about it, apologizing and basically asking if they feel I need to contribute. I obviously don’t want to be the asshole here - but I feel like if someone else couldn’t make the trip I wouldn’t even think about it and just pay any additional funds. What do you guys think?

edit: I just want to clarify that the accommodation was going to be booked regardless if all or some of the couples could go. Initially only three couples were going but then it was changed to four.

Also - a portion of the cost includes the refundable deposit. If I pay it then she will have to pay me back. Should I responsible to pay the damages deposit if I won’t be there?

Another edit: I did apologize to the other couples and let them know that I would pay the amount if it would put unneeded stress on them.","YTA - You owe at the very minimum your deposit cost. If you had planned a solo trip and suddenly two weeks out couldn’t go, you’d have to be an adult and pay the cost like everyone else does.

"AITA for asking my wife not to bring up one small topic anymore. About 6 month ago I got a hemorrhoid for the first time in my life.  It was new and strange so I told my wife about it but also told her that I was very embarrassed about it.  I told her originally because I do think communication is really important for a healthy and successful relationship.  She was really great and understanding and even picked up some meds for me.  Several weeks later she asked me how it was doing.  I told her that I was fine (I guess I wasn't super clear whether fine meant ""healed"" or just ""ok with how things were progressing"".  In any case I told her I was fine and that while I appreciated her concern, I would rather not speak about it ever again.  I did assure her that if things changed or if there new information, I would tell her.  Fast forward about a month and she asks how my hemorrhoid is. I kind of just look at her and ask if she recalls what we talked about last time this came up.  I reiterated that I was doing fine and that this is something I really don't want to talk about anymore. Fast forward again to today and she asks again.  My reaction is pretty much the same as last time - I ask her if she remembers what I have told her on this subject in the past.  Now she is upset and saying things like ""she doesn't want us to keep secrets from each other"" and ""we should be able to talk about these things"".  I agree with both statements, which is why I originally told her about the situation.  At this point I really believe she should respect my feelings/wishes and trust that I will tell her about anything that changes or is important - like I did originally.

IATA? Is it ok to request some small topics be off the table for discussion? Especially after we have already discussed them?  I feel like if anyone should be annoyed at this point it should be me, but right now, its her.

EDIT: She now knows it is completely healed and gone. I definitely told her that this time.  I would have sworn I told her it was healed when she brought it up the second time but she is telling me she doesn't recall that. I probably said some like ""fine"" or ""it was ok"". To me that may have meant healed but it was def not clear enough language in hindsight. Additionally, me thinking she already knew it was healed is why I kind of couldn't believe she was bringing it up a third time and def contributed to this being a bigger deal than it needed to be --------- Lesson learned: never use vague language.","YTA.

"AITA for ghosting my classmate?. Both males.

It started with us chatting for about twenty minutes in class waiting for the professor to come. We shared an interest in music production which neither of us had previously met anyone who had. We had a pretty good talk and exchanged phone numbers after. That day was the last day of the first semester so we wouldn't be seeing each other for a while after. He texted me about thirty minutes later and we started texting about music stuff pretty frequently since we had no one else to talk to about that subject for as long as we've been on this earth. He told me he'd be putting his major on hold for the second semester to attend a boot camp so I wouldn't see him there again that semester. We talked face to face a total of about an hour on three different occasions.   
After we ran out of music stuff to talk about he started getting personal, bordering on intrusive. He started sharing WAY too much about his life which made me feel wholly uncomfortable. Talking about how depressed he is and how his family is abusively strict. He wrote dense text blocks talking about his feelings and sharing experiences completely unprompted. I tried to show him that I wasn't comfortable by not taking his prompts and giving him straight forward answers as often as I could. I tried to keep it all surface leveled but he just kept on opening up and prompting me to open up. It was starting to feel very intrusive at that point and I decided that I would continue answering his huge blocks of texts but with no more than five words, hoping that he would take the hint and tone it down. He didn't.  
He'd been asking me to go grab a meal with him for a few weeks by that point but I always gave him excuses (without rescheduling). But it started to sound more and more desperate, almost to the point of begging. That's when I started being creeped out and taking huge steps back. I began being cold towards his overly personal conversational advances, replying with classics like ""damn bro"" and ""oh nice"". He sensed something and wrote an essay about how he's been hurt by people before and how he doesn't want me to be one of them and asked if it was the case. I answered his absolute behemoth of an essay with ""it's ok dude"". He then wished me good luck on the finals I had the next week. Come the first exam, mere minutes after leaving the exam room, a text reads: ""How was the exam?"". I was in no mood whatsoever to text him back and thought I would just leave it until some other time. There was no other time. five days later, ""Hey how are you man?"". A week, ""I finished the boot camp"". Another week, ""Yo is everything ok?"". That last one was about 2 weeks ago.

"WIBTA for leaving a note to a coworker that he makes too many throat noises?. My desk is in a cubicle area. There’s a coworker who sits about 2 cubicles down. He constantly makes noise with this throat. He clears his throat with a series of repeated *ahem*s and you can hear the phlegm bubbling in his throat. Or he takes in a snort of breath through his nose where you can again hear the phlegm. (edit 2 here): it’s not just a sharp intake or throat clear. When bubbling phlegm and snot is involved, there’s a very distinctive rumbling noise that all the fluid makes, similar to the sound of blowing bubbles through a straw. 

They’re loud and constant, peaking while he’s eating. I thought maybe I was overreacting so I set a timer and tallied each instance. Over a period of about 13 minutes he’s made a sound lasting over 2 seconds 9 times. He started 6 weeks ago and it’s been a daily occurrence.

"WIBTA if I took frozen food from the fridge at work if it was going to be tossed out due to company policy?. Every Sunday morning, our refrigerators at work get cleaned out. If something is in there, it gets tossed in the trash, containers and all. Sometimes, the lunch bags get tossed as well. 

Occasionally, I bring lunch and don't eat it because I want something from the cafe downstairs instead. This leads me to forgetting my lunch bag and then having to come back up on the weekend to get it so our good storage containers don't get tossed out. 

While I haven't, on occasion there are microwavable frozen dinners and other stuff in the freezers that are going to be tossed. Would I be the asshole if I took those?

"AITA for stealing back a friends skateboard from my other friend?. So about year ago, I was at work and my friend who comes in regularly to hang out with me (I work in a shop) popped through.  Lets call this friend John.  I was working, and John asked me a question about a skateboard that was sitting collecting dust on the bottom shelf of a nearby table.  He asked if I knew who's it was, and I said I did not.  My friend then asked me if he should steal it.  I wasn't all that about it, but I said whatever, and told him how best to avoid being seen in the cameras to avoid being caught.  John ended up taking the board and walking out.  

A few days later, a fellow co-worker of mine (Call him Anthony) complained that his skateboard had gone missing.  I then realized who's skateboard it was, but by then the damage had been done and I kept my mouth shut.  

Fast forward to today.  I was in John's new apartment and was just relaxing and hanging out.  He gave me a tour of his room and I saw Anthony's stolen skateboard.  I talked to John and explained I felt like it would be a good thing for me to return Anthony's skateboard.  John retaliated saying that the damage had already been done and that Anthony should've move on, further stating the skateboard was ""only 80 bucks"" and didn't matter all too much.  I insisted John think about returning the skateboard, and he said he would think about it. 

In the back of my mind, I decided I would ""steal back"" Anthonys skateboard and return it to him.  John and I went to a pizza place and I said I needed to run back to his place because I had forgotten something.  In reality, I went back to Johns place and grabbed Anthonys board, stashed it, and then picked it up once John and I parted ways.  John is now pissed at me, saying that he is more angry at the fact that I ""went behind his back"" than the fact I had taken the board, and that it was something he ""could not forgive"".

I've been supporting my boyfriend for the past year while he's been going through some rough patches in life (death of a relative, struggling with rejections for a job in a competitive field, etc.).

I've been missing out on some of his family events because of work or because I'm just too tired to attend after working 12+ hrs a day. His family has expressed their disappointment with me multiple times in passive-aggressive joking ways (future MIL scoffing/rolling her eyes when another family member says I'm constantly ""working"", having every single family member comment on my absence, saying I'm ""abandoning"" them, etc.).

I've noticed my future MIL not liking me as much as she used to, presumably because of my frequent absence. It hurts because I've been supporting her son both financially and emotionally while she has done practically nothing, while preaching that she's always here for her son.

My parents have taken in my boyfriend as their own son, allowing us to originally live at my mom's when boyfriend couldn't afford rent at his OWN parents house which they wouldn't waive for him (we have since moved out to our own apt).

He has changed somethings in his lifestyle as he is waking up early, walking our dogs and maybe spending a little more time with my little sister but apart from that idk what else he’s being doing. I am all for him yo be the best version of himself but he has not shut up about how acid changed his life and how he is becoming a better person. The issue is that lately i have been shutting him up when he is talking about how acid changed his life and he is becoming a better person, not because i don’t want him to be a better person but because he hasn’t shut up about how something changed his life when there is not much proof about that.
Ps: I believe that acid can be a tool for change but for me this things should be personal and not just a conversation piece

"WIBTA if i refuse my fathers Christmas present.. Since i was younger my dad has given me money as a Christmas gift (£100-150) along with a few small wrap ups normally a section box and socks. 

When i was 13 its was the best gifts in the world as gave me freedom to go to the cinema with my mates or buy some computer game when my dad would have got me the wrong one.

Now im older he still just transfers me some money. Now I have a full time job and am ok off financially and the gift seems a bit of a rubbish i allready have spare the income and just gets lost eith the rest of my money 

Over the past few years  i have tried to get him to buy me proper gifts dropping a few hints and last year i told him that i no longer want money. Still got money though. 

Yesterday i was at his for dinner and told him id like a belt or a new wallet and he told me he was going to give me money instead and i can just pick. I pushed back and said that i dont want money l, he got a bit frustrated told mr not to be ungrateful.

"WIBTA taking an extra seat on an almost busy bus?. I work nights, and depending on when I get off work, I either catch a rather empty just for the day starting bus, or the next one which is the college kids heading to school bus. Now the problem I have with the latter is that it usually only starts to really fill up just before my stop. And even when there's other seats open somehow everytime someone decides to sit beside me one or two stops away from mine. Which means I have to get that person to stand up and let me out. Now my question is would I be an asshole if I sat my bag beside me or sat in the aisle seat?

"WIBTA If I Didn’t Go To My Childs Birth Across The World?. I know the title sounds harsh. My (22M) wife (23F) are going through separation and divorce. We married too soon and hardly know each other. Aside from that we’ve had countless toxic arguments and so many disagreements. I lost feelings for her and she has for me. During our conversation about ending things, she asked if I would see the baby frequently. She is 6.5 months pregnant. We cannot find a way for her to stay here in the US, because her visas have expired and our marriage was the base of her residency (we were currently applying for a green card through marriage). Severing the marriage would mean she has to go home to her home country, Germany. I recently have been hired at a really good job and will be attending uni full time at the time of the child’s birth which will be in a couple months. During our arguments she said I would be a shitty father if I wasn’t there for the child’s birth and if I didn’t see the child at least once a month. Like, once a month across the world? I told her I would be there any way possible for my son to be. Any reasonable way. I would take full custody if I could, but we all know in court that won’t happen so I’ll have to be a long distant father for years to come. I would never fight over a child anyways, unless it was for his health and safety. He will be okay with her. He’s safe. Attending school full time and part time work is a huge deal. I also take care of my handicapped parents . All this seems so overwhelming and I just don’t see how I could drop school, work, and my family that needs me to travel across the world.

"AITA for not doing work because I was called an intern? (I am not an intern). Hello Redditors, 

I have been working at a company for 7 years (two summers as an intern) so 5 years of full-time employment. I am in a consulting division of the company that needs to get billable hours from other parts of the company. Recently, I received an email thread forwarded from my boss that had a non-billable work request from another part of the company for a monotonous activity. On the surface, I am fine with doing tasks like these to help gain recognition and future clients. However, I saw that my boss said he would have his ""intern"" do it, then immediately forwarded it to me telling me to do it. 

So, it appeared that the only value for me (gaining a client/recognition) in this non-billable activity had been removed from the equation. I get that if your boss asks you to do something, you should do it because you're getting paid. For this reason, I feel entitled for not doing what was asked of me because I do like my boss as a person. This has never been directly brought up and I have never said the main reason I did not do it was because I was called an intern. But there have been indirect conversations about doing the best thing for the company. Though I feel more like a resource than a person at my job, I have a nagging feeling that I have unnecessarily jeopardized my career for not doing this when I was admittedly not busy.

"AITA for matter-of-factly calling someone a drunk. So this girl. Me 34m, her 28f. We're neighbours, and great friends, and I genuinely enjoy her company, and we've fooled around a bit but it would never work because we always get in dumb arguments and she gets ridiculously insulting and I won't date someone who says hateful things when they lose their temper.

ANYWAY. Yesterday she asks to borrow my vacuum, and I say fine, just bring it back tonight (I'm very protective of my vacuum). She groans a bit, and I'm like, why do you need it for more than a couple of hours at most, you can come borrow it any time you want, you just can't keep it overnight. A few hours later she asks what I'm up to and I say not much, want to come for dinner? and she says ""nope, I'm out for the night, xo."" And I say ""so, does that mean you're done with my vacuum,"" and she says ""don't worry, I'll lock up."" And I say ""Haha, listen, I want my vacuum,"" and she says ""Is that really your brain process works? Are you kidding me? I'll be over with your damn vacuum in an hour."" Two hours go by, and I message her, saying ""hey, what's up?"" She replies: ""Hello you."" I say ""Vacuum?"" And she loses it: ""Omg...you're fucking pathetic, I actually hate you, come get your damn vacuum."" I think she's mad that I don't trust her with it. I'm not a super trusting person, I don't think that makes me an asshole, but whatever. I go over to her house and get the vacuum. She's drunk and belligerent and mean, and I leave, and I send her a message saying something like ""No idea what your problem is, but I'll come and ask you tomorrow.""

Next morning (this morning). She asks my buddy (31m) and I if we want to go for brunch. I tell buddy that I'm still super unimpressed with her for being so rude, and that I'd LOVE to go to brunch with her and call her out for it. Buddy laughs and says he will not bring me if I don't agree to behave, so I agree to behave. We get to White Spot and we're talkin' and getting along great, until the conversation turns to her being mad at me for talking shit about somebody...then she says that she read my phone once and saw all the shit that I talk about her. I roll my eyes...buddy interjects that whatever I was saying probably didn't feel to me like ""talking shit."" She pointed out the time that I told some other girl that I couldn't meet up with her because I was ""babysitting a drunk."" I just shrugged and said ""so?"" ""A drunk,"" she says. I look at her and say ""You are a drunk."" I mean, she is. Buddy is already excusing himself to go and have a smoke because he knows this isn't turning out good. Girl looks mad and maybe a little hurt. She says to me ""You look me in the eyes and say that with such confidence...,"" so I double down and look her right in the eyes, ""You. are. a drunk."" Bam, she throws her drink in my face and storms off. The glass hits the seat and rolls onto the floor and shatters. Server asks if I'm alright. I shrug and order a coffee. At this point I really want my eggs benedict.

So my questions today are:

1) Is what I am doing here in this thread ""Talking shit about her?"" Would she be justified in being angry at me for this post?

2) Am I the asshole for telling a drunk to her face that she's a drunk?

3) Am I the only one who feels really uncomfortable lending out their vacuum?

4) Is it bad of me to be more concerned with being right than with her feelings in this situation? Because I frankly find it difficult to care. Some part of me cares, but a bigger part of me is like ""stay away from this girl,"" but an even bigger part is like ""troll her about it.""","Yeah, you're an asshole.  To your other mate.  You ruined his brunch engaging in the behaviour he was specifically worried about and you explicitly promised not to engage in.   Sure you were provoked, but how dumb would you have to be not to have forseen that?  You should have just not risen to it.  That was a dick move.

You and this girl have weird issues and do weird shit to each other, whether that being oddly pass-ag about cleaning equipment or scrolling through the others phone or having pointless petty arguments of no consequences in inappropriate social settings.  Obviously we're only getting your side, but it seems like your just weirdly vindictive to one another. 

As for the drunk thing, it doesn't matter.  You were saying that to her in an attempt to be personal and wounding, so it's just a random insult, no worse no better than calling her a cunt or something.  You can't pretend there was any genuine concern for her intended in what you said, so it doesn't matter if you were 'right' or not.

****

(Tangent: though if you really do care, from my British perspective it sounds very unlikely that she's a drunk, and more just likes the casual drink now and again like most of us do.  You give no indication that this is an uncontrollable pattern of behaviour that affects anything beyond her personal life.

"AITA for wanting to get rid of my boyfriends beloved dresser?. My boyfriend is a very sentimental person. He would keep EVERYTHING if he could. I on the other hand tend to throw away anything I no longer find practical and full purge once a year.

My boyfriends grandfather made him this dresser when we were kids. Probably about 22 years ago. Its power blue and white, covered in old logo stickers (mostly car parts brands and sports teams) and its very small.

We have agreed that I will move in in the new year and I want him to get rid of it so we can get a dresser together. One that is big enough for both of our clothes and presents a more mature front.

We are in our late 20s and it seems absurd to me for us to keep a children's dresser thats covered in stickers. He says "" it will be perfect for his shop one day"" but we dont have a shop now, we only have 2 bedrooms and we really dont have room for 2 dressers. 

I get it that his grandfather made it for him and that means a lot to him. He wants to keep it so bad hes suggested getting me a new dresser and stacking the two so we cant keep both.

But i hate the damned thing. Its an eye store and its tacky as fuck looking. AITA for insisting we get rid of it?

Edit* the second bedroom is technically his office. But its absolutely filled with boxes of mostly his old toys and vhs tapes. 
He asked me to move in, but hasnt made any actual space in the home for me. He wants me to just move into his house and leave it as is. And im okay with that for the most part, i just want one room where i can relax and feel at home and that dresser really does stand in the way of that.

Edit 2. Okay i get it clearly im a dick here for not sharing in the sentiment. But ive asked if we can restore it and he refuses. He says its "" too far gone"" with the stickers. And he doesnt want to move it into the other room because "" there is no room in there as it is""",YTA.

"AITA for insisting that my fiancé’s dad pays for his tuition?. Background: My (28F) fiancé’s (29M) dad has been a professor at an Ivy League university in our city for 30+ years. His position comes with benefits, including undergraduate tuition exemption for any kids under 26 and taxable tuition (explained below) for any kids in grad school.


Fiancé’s parents divorced when he was young. Dad refused to pay child support for years which caused a lot of bitterness between him and mom. Mom did not hide her hatred, fiancé grew up being told his dad didn’t care about him – he has depression and a bad relationship with his mom, but when he got older and dad quit drinking, relationship with dad got better despite their past. 


Fiancé dropped out of college in ’09 after his first semester and that’s when we met and started dating. Next few years he went to community college near my college, we lived together (‘11-‘13) and his mom paid his rent, and after I graduated (‘13) and moved back home he moved with me and lived with me at my mom’s house rent-free (my mom is awesome and loves him like a son). We both worked for a few years (‘14-‘17) and in that time he decided he wanted to apply to finish his degree at his dad’s school. He got in and bc he was still 26, paid no tuition for the next 2-3 years and finished his degree this past May. He got into a master’s program (with a small scholarship) at the same school but now has to pay some tuition.


Each year he has taken out a small loan ($8-10K) to help with living expenses, books etc. I am not working anymore (back in school) but with savings from my job and a substantial inheritance from my father, I keep us comfortable, pay rent and most bills, which I am fine with. However, I cannot afford to help my fiancé with tuition (nor would I be allowed to since my inheritance is in a trust and heavily regulated).


Taxable tuition 101: the tuition that would normally be paid is added onto the professor’s income. If dad makes $100K/year and tuition is $20K, his income is considered $120K and he is taxed based on that amount. So if income tax is 30% of annual income, he pays $36K in taxes instead of $30K. This results in a loss of $6K for that year (none of these numbers are exact but also not too far off from the real numbers).


Dad does not want to lose this income and wants fiancé to pay him back. My feeling is that he never paid child support, tuition, or living expenses for his son growing up (despite having the means), and this is a small price to pay for his neglect. Fiancé told dad he can’t afford to pay him back so dad said fine, he’ll pay, and his girlfriend even offered to pay half. Recently they spoke again and dad reneged, he still wants money from fiancé for tuition. This money would come out of the loan money he receives for living expenses which he already has to pay back. We think dad is being selfish and unreasonable. What do you think?

Edit: Thanks for all your responses. In retrospect a more accurate query would have been “AITA for suggesting/feeling like it would be the right thing for my fiancé’s dad to not make my fiancé pay him back for income lost due to taxable tuition?”, mainly because some of the finer points were missed and my actual part in his conversation with his dad was misinterpreted due to my poor phrasing (I was not part of their conversation at all and merely offered my fiancé my opinion), but I accept your judgment regardless and thank all of you for your time and thoughts.",YTA simply put you can’t force someone to pay something for your benefit you and your fiancé are both adults knocking on the door to 30.

"AITA for being relieved that my GF was not in an accident that badly injured her BFF’s family?. Background: GF & I (M) have been together for 3 years, very much in love. We currently live in the same town as her parents. This is also the town she & her parents grew up in, so they have loads of extended family & close friends there. Her family has an annual tradition of doing a road trip in summer. They usually also rope in some other family & since they know so many, it’s almost always 2-3 families who do the trip together.

This year, a close friend of GF’s dad had his daughter getting married in another town. Two families decided to make a road-trip out of it, so it was 2 cars & 8 people. Other family happens to be GF’s BFF’s family. GF’s dad & BFF’s dad are childhood friends. She was super excited about it & going by the socmed updates, it was a very fun trip. All adults were taking turns to drive & would just randomly sit in either of the cars. Since she was anyway not around, I decided to go visit my folks in the same week. 
Unfortunately on the way back, the other car (which had BFF, BFF’s older sister & parents) met with a bad collision. GF’s car which was behind them witnessed it all. Thankfully they received immediate medical help, but by all indications it seems BFF’s dad might not pull through. Her sister’s also critical & will likely be dependent all her life. BFF & her mum have multiple fractures, but doctors are confident that they will bounce back to normal. 
Very distraught GF called to inform me of this. I listened in quiet horror, but my only thought was thank fuck she was not in the car. After she was done talking, this was the first thing I blurted out “Sweetie, I’m so glad you were not in that car. I hope things get better soon for BFF & family. Anything I can do?” I got the feeling that she was a bit taken aback. She said she was upset & tired from crying so said bye abruptly. I’ve been sending her tender texts but no response. She texted me later saying that I was an insensitive asshole for having that reaction. BFF’s family, which is like their extended family, is battling for life & all I could think of was GF not being in that car? I was dumbfounded. I’m fond of BFF & I’m glad that she’s going to be fine. I don’t really know the rest of the family. But I’m sure as hell that I love my GF & her family to bits & my relief was an honest reaction. I’ve been an overthinker all my life (sought counseling for it because I thought it interfered with my interpersonal relationships) I did not expect my GF to react so coldly. I do understand she’s traumatised, but she’s never been so mean to me. I asked my mom for her opinion & she feels I should’ve shown more tact in responding. 
It’s been 20 hours. GF is in no mood to talk or text because she hasn’t gotten over how callous I was.

"AITA for not paying a Taxi Driver the entire journey fee due to the road to my estate being closed. Happened about 3 hours ago, basically I got a taxi back from the barbers and just before we get into the estate I live in, the road has been closed off due to roadworks going on.

We were around 2 minutes drive from my house (around 5-10 min if I walk) so I say to the driver, drop me off here, and I'll walk the rest, but I'll pay £4.50, rather than the agreed £5.

He argues that the exact spot where we are currently stopped at is still within the £5 catchment area, so regardless of if he drops me off here or at my house, the price would still be £5.


I argued that, while that may be true, his job was to get me home, as agreed when he took the job. Now either he goes around another route to drop me off or he agrees to £4.50. 

He didn't fancy driving around so he says pay the £4.50 and walk.

"AITA for calling my girlfriend's friend a whore because she uses sex as a currency in her relationship?. Girlfriend's friend Tanya was at a party with us Friday.  She was complaining about her relationship with her boyfriend Josh of 3 years.  According to Tanya she has to withhold sex from Josh in whenever he doesn't treat her right.  When pressed she said that ""treating her right"" means two date nights a week to expensive restaurants, at least 2 flower deliveries to her office a month so her coworkers can see them, and 2 vacations out of the country a year.

Now Josh and I aren't super close but we are close enough that I've hung out with him before and heard him complain about Tanya.  Based on what Josh has said and what Tanya was openly admitting it is pretty obvious to me that she is super high maintenance and obsessed with wealth and status.

Well as Tanya keeps talking she eventually switches gears to complaining that Josh will basically plan the date night, have dinner, sex, and then disappear afterwards.  My response to her is where I think I was an asshole.

Me: ""Of course that's what happens.  You've turned sex into a transaction in exchange for him spending a bunch of money on you.  You require money for sex.  When you act like a whore don't be surprised when you're treated like one.""

Before anyone could respond I turned and went to a different group to talk about something else.  Tanya left soon after that.

I had gotten a little aggravated listening to her complaining and bragging about using sex to manipulate him.  It was a big part of what caused my dad to leave my mom and is a sore spot for me, but if I was an asshole there I don't think that should excuse my behavior.  When I got home that night my girlfriend told me I was an asshole and ruined a perfectly good party.","YTA.

"AITA for telling my mom that I will not share things with her anymore?. My cousin (33M), who lives across the country from my family and his family, got admitted to the hospital for an influenza and got quarantined. His wife (33F) told me (halfway across the world from everyone else), and I know they trust me to not tell his parents, as he shares the same ideas as I do - not tell parents our problem(s) until we resolved them.  He is also recovering steadily after being admitted. Given that it is influenza season, I decided to tell my mom about it so she could take more precautions, since she gets sick pretty easily. I told her repeatedly to not tell his parents, as he would tell them himself if he wanted to, and my aunt would be unhappy to learn about cousin being sick from my mom, as opposed to from my cousin himself. I managed to convince my mom to not do so. But, mom would not stop telling me to talk to cousin-in-law and tell her to inform my aunt and uncle. I told her that this is their decision and I should not tell them do something that they clearly are not ready to do. 

Since this didn't gain any traction, she wanted to call cousin-in-law to do it herself. I told her that if she were to do that, my cousin and his wife will never give me life updates anymore, in fear I would spread to my mom, who would then notify my aunt. She kept insisting that she is worried about them and there should be more adults to weigh in the decision of his care. I told my mom that they are not children, as they are both adults who are capable of making their own decisions and she should not treat them as if they were children. She agreed. 

Fast forward to a couple of hours later, she told me that she had contacted my cousin. She said that he had told him that he has already been discharged and only caught a cold. My cousin downplayed the situation and lied to my mom, a clear sign he didn't want her to know the full situation. I got really irated and snapped:

1. Mom knew very clearly she could do nothing to help him.
2. She rarely ever contact them and ""coincidentally"" contacting my cousin while he is sick, is weird.

I also told her that I will not share anything with her anymore, as I can no longer trust her to keep it to herself and not act on something she can do nothing about, just to make herself better that she did ""something"", when that ""something"" usually makes the other party feel worse. 

She got irritated and said that it's my fault for not telling her that he has been discharged and is recovering. (irl, cousin is still in quarantine) I hated the way that this ended up - I merely wanted her to use the information that the influenza season is actually happening, and take extra care of herself. However, I find myself unable to trust her with information anymore, since no matter what I told her to not do, she would do it anyway, just to make herself feel better, without consideration for others involved and the bigger picture.

"AITA for making black jokes while being ""light skinned""?. I'm actually half black, but unlike the rest of my family I'm pretty pale which has been a source of amusement since I was a child. No, my mother didn't cheat (she's the black half of the relationship), but most people usually assume I'm latino or from some foreign country, or that my brothers are from another father and my mother must be white. Like I said, I've always found it pretty funny and so has everyone else. My nickname growing up was white boy and I've always called my older brother darkie in response to that, and it's always been cool. I spend far more time with the black side of my family given my father isn't very close to his own, and consider myself black personally. 

Recently while out with workmates my brother gave me a call and we started up with our usual carry on. When a new (white) co-worker of mine heard me greet him by calling him darkie she looked noticeably shocked, and after the call ended she started to have a real go at me and told me that I had no right to speak that way. I told her that I consider myself black and she had the audacity to laugh at me and then tell me that I was white passing (I'm pale but I don't look white so I consider that pretty fucking silly to say) and then asked me if I was a quarter cherokee. At this point I got pretty annoyed and told her I could introduce her to my entire n\*\*\*\*r family if it'd calm her down.

She absolutely flipped out at this and actually stormed out of the place we were eating. A few of my (white) friends were pretty uncomfortable after this and said that I shouldn't have said that word. I see no problem with using a word I've grown up with and hear weekly from my family members and black friends.

Apparently she decided to contact our boss over what happened, because I got a text from him yesterday telling me he wants me to come in for a chat before my next shift. A few of my other co-workers have told me she's been talking about it with the rest of the crew and is still in an outrage over it.

When I told my brother about what happened and what I said to her he found it absolutely hilarious. He's even volunteering to go into work with me to meet my boss and hang around the place so the new girl can get a eyeful. The rest of my family also think the situation is funny, but my girlfriend thinks that's just because they know me and other black people might find it offensive given I don't look 100% african.

"AITA My (29 YOM) GF (25 YOF) is upset because I wasn't enjoying myself at a wedding due to fatigue and decided to leave early. I was invited to my girlfriend's cousin's wedding that took place yesterday at a venue about 45 minutes drive away from where I live. She is a bridesmaid. 

The issue is that I work night shifts at a particularly stressful workplace. The plan was for me to clock off at 8am, go back home, snooze and wake up to get ready for the ceremony at 1430hrs. What really happened was reaching home at 0930hrs and trying (and failing) to fall asleep (this was day 2 of a week of nights) due to my sleep cycle being set on days and also because of general weekend noise. End result =2 hours and a bit of sleep when I was hoping for at least 4.

I decide to skip the ceremony and try to make the reception instead , however not much more sleep was gained. I text her pleading to let me off the hook but she refused. I turn up but was so fatigued that I was barely engaging with anyone. I'm not a good talker at the best of times because of social anxiety but I was particularly quiet last night. I end up leaving before the food was served because I had shoulder and neck cramps and had to drive home. I reach my car and was so exhausted I fell asleep for 2 hours while still parked.

"WIBTA If I follow through in only eating Takis for 60 days to pay off a bet I lost? (My alma-mater winning the NCAA tourney).. So posting from a throwawy because my wife is so furious with me, I think she’d just yell at me here too. 

So background: after Arizona bombing out of the tournament last year I made my best friend a bet that U of A would win the entire thing in 2019. I was so drunk when I made the bet that I even put it in writing. If I lost I had to eat only Takis for 60 days (and water so I don’t die) I don’t have to eat a certain amount but the only thing that can cross my lips are Takis.

"AITA for keeping ""good cause"" donations for myself?. My friends and I are all in our senior year of college. 4 of my friends and I got a house right off campus for the year. It's already famous for being a party house. We have thrown parties each weekend so far since the start of semester. 

The parties get out of hand sometimes. To my friends and I, it's worth it though. The house is trashed and has to be thoroughly cleaned the next morning, but hasn't been bad enough to get us to stop yet. It's time and money consuming, as we provide the alcohol and get the party on everybody's radar. 

This past weekend the party was a special one. For a week we had been building up to it, you had to have an invite to get in. The theme was funny and interesting (where people dressed as what scares them-turned sexy)

The day of the party we had the house decorated. Invites had been sent. Alcohol was purchased. Blunts pre rolled.

I turned to one of my friend's (let's say mark) and told him ""we really should find a way to make money off of this"" Mark laughed and agreed, saying ""at least enough to pay us back for the alcohol."" After joking back and forth for a minute I had a fucking outstanding epiphany. I was going to make money off of it. 

I took a jar we had already in the house and made it into a donation jar. On the front of the jar I wrote, ""for a good cause"" thinking, amused to myself, I am a good cause. 

I then volunteered for ""bouncer"" where before getting into our house you have to show your invite. With the donation jar in front of me, I had no real expectations. Getting $50 would be a real win for me. 

Well I had no idea what I was in for. 

A couple of people did ask what the cause was, and I laughed and said funding next week's party. Which usually got a laugh and hoot and a couple of dollars thrown in. 

After a couple of hours I took the jar to my room, went back down to get high and drunk and spent the rest of the night partying. 

The next morning I remember it, not being able to process what was happening at the time because I was too fucked up. I go count the jar. There's over $800 in that thing. I couldn't believe it when I counted it at first. I organized bills into the same piles and counted again. Yep, 800. I'm stoked. I'm planning on doing this every week. 100$ at most spent on everything for the party, for a $700 come up each week by partying? I think I'm a genius. I change my facebook bio to entrepreneur. No big deal.

"WIBTA for how I plan to handle my mom’s adultery?. My parents have always had a bad relationship, to the point that they can’t have a conversation without getting mad at each other. They make each other miserable. My dad probably shouldn’t have gotten married in the first place and seems to do better alone. My mom and I have tried to convince him to see a marriage counselor and he refuses, but he also doesn’t make an effort when we try and talk to him about problems we have with him. It’s like you can tell he doesn’t care and is just waiting for you to stop talking.

I’ve suspected my mom might be cheating on my dad since I was in middle school, when I accidentally found love letter addressed to her. This was confirmed years later when she was being shifty about some “work thing” and confessed to me that she was actually meeting a man, and that it wasn’t her first time doing something like this. She didn’t say it, but based on the letter and some things I noticed over the years, I inferred that it had been going on for basically my entire life. I hate to say it, but I was relieved to find this out; I thought it meant my parents might divorce. Well, apparently not. My mom told me she wasn’t planning on leaving my dad, basically just because it would be difficult for her (having to move out, her not having as much disposable income via him, figuring out where I‘d go, etc.) It seems like she just wants the best of both worlds (my father’s money with fulfilling relationships on the side.) 

As an only child, I’m stuck in the middle while they take out their frustrations about the other on me. I really try to be understanding—my mother’s previous marriage was abusive, so it’s no wonder she’s settled, and my father definitely has some sort of undiagnosed issue that makes any kind of relationship difficult for him, but it’s hard. I’ve tried to talk to them both but it doesn’t work. My dad insists they still love each other, and my mom acts like nothing can be done.

I don’t want this to continue for the rest of their lives, and I don’t want to keep my mom’s adultery a secret from my dad because that isn’t fair to him. I’m 18 now and while I won’t be moving out for awhile, I thought of a plan for when I do. I know my mom’s phone password, and would easily be able to get evidence of what she’s been doing to give to my dad. I know this is a breach of privacy, but I’m scared that without something tangible and recent, they’ll just be able to sweep it under the rug and go back to their normal lives. I’ve even thought of telling them when I leave that I can’t be in their lives until they take some sort of action themselves because I’ve always had to be the one in the middle, the rock. I love them and just want them to try and better their lives because it feels like they gave up, and while the last thing I want to do is hurt anyone it doesn’t seem like talking to them makes a difference. ","YWBTA unfortunately, it is a breach of privacy and your mother will likely never forgive you. Also it's a bad idea because you reaaaallly don't want to be in the middle of a marital dispute.

"WIBTA if I exposed a wrongdoing committed by my rival for a promotion?. Last week, our HR department announced an opening for a senior supervisory position in our department. I was one of two primary candidates for the spot.

While I have a great professional and personal relationship with my coworkers, I know that my \~nemesis\~ for the job would be a terrible boss. She is lazy and settles for mediocrity. She almost always just does the bare minimum and submits outputs at the last minute, sometimes even late. She's also always sucking up to our higher-ups (I think that's the only thing she's good at). We all know that she's only being considered for the spot because of seniority (she's been with the company for almost 10 years) and because she's a sweet mother-like figure to everyone. Modesty aside, I know I'm a better employee (I've been with the company for just over 2 years but I've been consistently among the top performers) and that I'd be a better supervisor.

While I've had no problems working with her (we have different shifts, and we only interact when I render overtime), I just can't stand the thought of working *for* her. Then I remembered that when I was just starting here, I stumbled upon something. She steals from our office. Just small things like coffee packs and spoons from other employees, but I've seen people getting fired over this. With her tenure in our company, who knows how much worth of things she's stolen. I kept my mouth shut because, again, we're friends.

However, I am now contemplating turning her in just to give me leverage for the promotion. I have evidence to back up my claim (she messaged me before asking me to turn a blind eye because it's harmless). She also doesn't have a family to support that I know of, so I'm not too worried about kids going hungry if she eventually gets terminated (I hope not though, I'm just hoping she'd be suspended and/or taken off the candidates' list).

"AITA for being upset with the way my boyfriend shows affection to friends?. My boyfriend is in a very close group of friends of guys who have all known each other since middle school (the get compared to something like the loser's club from IT). We are now in our early twenties and they are still as tight as ever. They are friendly with me and make me feel welcome during social events.

One of the guys, Derek, is a gay man who also has a boyfriend, separate from the group. Of all the other guys, he and my very straight bf are the closest. They also are very touchy and affectionate with each other. Sometimes one of them will lean up against the other's chest or wrap their arm around their shoulders while they're lounging on the couch. They give each other kisses on the cheek when greeting and saying goodbye. They also usually share a bed if they're going on trips together ""to save cash"".

I thought I was crazy for being weirded out by this, and almost worried I was being slightly homophobic. I was hoping that Derek's boyfriend would validate my worries but I've never noticed him flinch once when we're all together. Derek and bf will walk arm and arm for a while, and then Derek will turn around and grab his bf by the hand and continue walking.

That tweet says to me that trans people shouldn’t care about what pronouns people use for them. You might think it’s not a fight worth fighting but people are literally being killed for trying to be themselves and have people acknowledge who they are.  There are gonna be people out there who are a part of a group but simply aren’t into the activist role. That doesn’t make them any more right than the outspoken, “faces of the movement” kinda people.

"AITA for laughing at my boyfriend when he cried during a movie?. I have never seen my boyfriend cry, or even shed a tear even after a death in the family, or pain in the 4 years we’ve been together.

So I was at my boyfriends house and we were watching Marley and me and he cried at the end, not cry but a few tears. I laughed and said aww the movie made you cry? I wasn’t trying to make fun of him but I just thought it was funny a movie set him off when he didn’t even cry when he broke his back.  He was furious and told me to go home, he won’t reply to his texts now. AITA?

TLDR; my boyfriend cried at the ending of Marley and me and I laughed, he won’t reply to my texts now",YTA. Comments like this is why it’s hard for men to open up. We live in a society where men are taught to be tough. You laughing at him in his most vulnerable time is pretty shitty.,1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for lying to my dad about my school situation for 3 weeks. Ok, so I’m a junior in high school, and I’ve been hit HARD by school. It’s not an exaggeration to say this has been my hardest month of school ever. I have 7 classes, 5 of them are AP/honors level, and I signed myself up for way too much shit. My biggest problem is that I get really anxious when I overwhelmed, and i end up avoiding everything by procrastinating on the internet. I’ve had a year long research paper I just finished yesterday, test, projects, hw, insanity. My dad knows this and wanted to help the whole time.

My parents are divorced btw, they switch off at the house weekly. I asked for his help on much of the stuff, but then I lied about the year long research paper. We’d been working together on it all February, so two weeks ago at the switch off,I told him I got a rough draft in, when I hadn’t finished it. This made him happy because he thought I had just made the deadline. My mom had a stressful work project she couldn’t help me. 

So how did I spend the two weeks while my paper was overdue? Panicking and wasting all my time on YouTube and Reddit. I frequently told my mom I was studying when I wasn’t. I also told my dad when it was his week and he asked that the teacher was being really late on getting back comments, still covering up how behind I truly was. Finally, it came to Wednesday, I bombed a Biology test, I bombed a music theory test, I was pissed off and scared. I told my mom that I got back the comments, and my “analysis is weak,” and I need help. She didn’t til 2 am with me working on it, and finally, together we scrounged together a decent paper and turned it in yesterday. Who knows how badly my grade will be affected by the lateness, luckily I managed A’s on that class’s tests without studying because I’m just good at history tests. I actually managed to do most of my overdue hw and now I’m chilling for the first time in 2019. 

So I understand that I messed up, I signed up for only 5 classes next year. I know I should’ve told my parents about my hw truthfully, but they would’ve just been more stressed and come down on me, making me more anxious. It sorta all worked out in the end. So am I the asshole, and what should I do going forward?
","NAH 
I can't come down with a hammer on you, OP.
You acknowledge that you messed up, and you know how to work towards fixing it. That is good.

You're getting older so you won't be needing to report to your parents about everything. Your parents know this. They also know that you are responsible for your life and whatnot, but at the same time, they want to be there for you. It's fantastic you have parents who can help you and while you were dishonest, you know better.

Get your rear back into gear, you can do it! Take the help your parents offer and stay honest this time. Chin up, move forward.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for being bitchy to my parents about how much I hate my name?. I hate my name. I was named after a character from a popular fantasy book series. Mom sometimes tells me these books saved her life from depression and I’m named after her favorite character. One of my middle names is also the name of a “strong female lead” from a movie as dad’s input.

At school people make jokes about it. People photoshop my face onto memes (art from the books and videos). The school is useless. They make the bullies apologize and I have to accept it because that’s what a “good Christian” does.

So what I decided to do was every time this happened and I got home I’d tell my parents how much I hate my name and hate that they gave it to me. Sometimes I’ll be a bitch and push hard enough that I can make mom or dad cry. But if I have to live with this, so do they.

"AITA for pushing my husband to apologize to his parents?. I'll preface this to say that my husband (late 30's) and myself (mid 30's) have had a really hard past year. We were separated for 8 months or so, I moved home a few months ago and the anger and respect (on his part) are better but still having some struggles and apologizing has been a HUGE thing for me. He almost never apologizes for hurting my feelings. I will point blank tell him what he did/said hurt me and he still doesn't say anything.

Fast forward to July 4 we were at his parents visiting. We live close by and see them maybe once a month or so. His parents are extremely religious, his dad used to be the pastor of the church I attended when we met. My husband is agnostic/atheist...I'm not really sure where he falls. I am not overly religious, and we are both quite liberal in our views, while his parents (and mine) are both Trump supporters.

For myself, politics are not allowed as a serious conversation in my parents house when I'm there because it results in overly heated conversations and we care enough about each other that we don't want hurt feelings. We both acknowledge that we likely won't change the other's view points, and so we'd rather just keep that topic out of conversation usually.

My husband started talking to his parents about politics b/c they were planning on watching the trump speech that night and he made some comments about how awful he was. I mentioned the rule at my parents house, trying to hint that they shouldn't get into it. They dropped it a bit, but later when I was in the bathroom, I came out and heard them going off on each other again. His dad was respectful about it but my husband was basically laughing at him, saying how disappointed he was that they support trump because they are voting on one issue basically (abortion of course) and I kept trying to mitigate it but they kept arguing back and forth. My husband was a little aggressive and insinuating they are ignorant, etc. We finally left, but I could tell they were hurt when we did.

I found out from his sister, that his parents are still very hurt but don't want this to come between them. I have been gently suggesting he apologize for how he spoke to them. NOT for his opinions, but the way he talked down to them. He feels he did nothing wrong and refuses to apologize. They have been calling/texting and he ignores it. I think he's being childish, and basically doing the same thing to them that he does to me. Last night he got very angry at me and told me he doesn't want to hear anything else about it.

Am I an asshole when I (nicely) suggest he needs to apologize? Their relationship has always been fine...not super close but fine. The way he has acted to me when I suggest it also bothers me because he gets instantly angry and defensive. I wanted to bring this up in counseling tonight where we have a buffer to try and help talk thru things.

EDIT: I forgot a sentence in the 2nd to last paragraph","YTA. Its been two weeks and your still going on about it. You can't force him to apologize or dictate how his relationship is with his parents. I think if you look deeper you may fine your real issue is you want to see change in his ways and hoping that if he changes his approach with his parents you can be more assured that the changes he has made with you will stick. 

But at the end of the day, the relationship with his family is his to destroy if he so chooses and even if not, he has made it clear his position and what actions he is willing to take. To continue on about it makes you an asshole cause you are trying to force him to do what he has made clear he doesn't plan on doing.",1,1,0,0,0
"WIBTA for keeping my ex-roommate's half of the security deposit?. Four months ago, my roommate moved out in the middle of our lease. She was a close friend, but we did have issues...nonetheless, I was still shocked and hurt when one fight turned out to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back and she announced she was leaving immediately. She hasn’t spoken to me since then. While I’m still hurt and mourning the end of our friendship, I know us living together was becoming unhealthy. I do wish we could at least be friendly again someday because we have a lot of mutual friends and I still care about her. All this to say, my dilemma is not driven by spite or anger at the personal aspects of the situation.

Unrelated to the main conflict, many of the squabbles we had when we were living together centered on money, as she was (and still is) much more privileged financially than I am. Dumb things like the thermostat temp and toilet paper were an issue. Therefore, she didn’t wait until our lease was up to move out...she just paid for the remaining months (we pay rent to the landlord separately). She even offered to pay for half the utilities for the remaining months. 

However, we had also signed the lease for the following year already. I told her I planned to stay (because it was cheap and I loved the house), and she would need to find a replacement to take over her half of the lease. She flat out refused and said her lawyer friend would get her out of it. It made me rethink staying (with a new random person, in a house with soured memories) and so I decided to move too. I had to find new tenants to take over the lease and finding a new place for myself, which was especially difficult as our town operates on a weird yearly real estate market and I was looking in the off-season. I barely slept for almost a month because I was so anxious I would end up with 2 leases or none for the next year until I got the situation resolved. 

I finally got to move out last week and I spent the month leading up to that on fixing up the house. When we moved in 2 years ago, we had made a lot of cosmetic changes to the house because I love decorating and had planned to live there for 4-5 years. I remember being glib about losing the security deposit because I thought we’d be there for so long. But my new place is more expensive (because of looking in the off-season) and I had to pay for moving expenses so I ended up working really hard to make sure I’d get that money back.

And I did! But, to my surprise, I got the full amount credited to me, not just my half of the deposit (she definitely paid half before we moved in). WIBTA if I kept the money instead of sharing it with her? I feel like I’m owed at least some compensation for the time, energy, and labor that went into finding someone to take over the lease, fixing up the house before moving out, and even just being forced to move in a year I hadn’t planned to. However, I’m afraid that it will make it impossible for us to ever be friendly again if I don’t offer her half.","YTA you dont ""deserve"" to keep your ex-roomates security deposit. She paid rent for the remaning months on the lease and even offered to pay utilities. If she made a post about this situation asking  WIBTA for leaving I would say no. As you said it was become a unhealthy enviorment for both of you,  

>she was (and still is) much more privileged financially than I am. 

You are using this to think it wont affect her if you dont give her back her half of the security deposit. It does not matter if she is richer than you, it does not mean you can take her money. 

Finally if you really are sad that your relationship with her ended as you say in the post. Then returning her half of thr deposit money is a good start to making amends.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for refusing to buy a dishwasher when my partner say it’ll make life easier?. I hand wash my dishes, it doesn’t bother me, never has (I don’t love it either). I don’t do leaving dishes in the sink until later. The exception is dishes are left in the sink whilst I’m eating food that I want to preserve its prepared temperature. I’ll do this even after breakfast before work.

My partner, isn’t like this. She leaves dishes in the sink to soak and deal with them hours or a day later. She’ll put a used mug or plate in the sink to soak and take out a fresh one for a new coffee or snack. This leads to the sink filling up and stuff getting caked on cookware. Most of the time I end up doing these dishes. Partner uses this as an example why we need a dishwasher because it’s difficult to clean.

I guess I nag about this, but to me I see it as a small effort. Partner disagrees and hates doing dishes, to the point she’s demanding we buy a dishwasher because it would “make life so much easier”. I refuse as it’s not that big of an effort. I’ll concede it could make life easier, but not at that cost.

My stance is I’m not agreeing to spend our joint money on this or my personal money. I just don’t see the value it brings compared to its cost (price, maintenance, etc.). Partner is livid, but I’m standing firm.

**TL;DR**

Doing dishes doesn’t bother me, partner hates doing dishes. Partner wants a dishwasher to make life easier. I say no. Partner upset, but I still say no.","YTA—but only because you want all the compromises to be in your favor: a clean sink,  no extra money being spent, sharing the chore equally.

"WIBTA for giving my family skincare routines for Christmas?. I'm a college student and  money is tight. I've gotten bored of giving my family the same candle, robe, soft slipper gifts that I have gotten them before. They don't seem genuine and I don't really see them use it. I love my family and want to give them things they will actually appreciate.

The past year I've gotten really into skincare and my family has notice and has complimented me on it. They then subtly tell me things they wish they didn't have on their skin or what they want to change. So I had an idea to give them a skincare routine on fancy paper and stuff. With one item on the list to get them started. Along with some more info on how to achieve what they want. I told my friend about this and she had a fit. She said it's rude and equivalent to giving someone deodorant or soap and that I'm basically calling them ugly and flaunting my nice skin in their face.

"AITA for Getting a Cell Phone for Christmas and Telling Them I Didn't Want One?. A little bit of a backstory: When I was first introduced to a fully functional cell phone to use by me and my brother, it was not high-tech, which means no web surfing, YouTube, or MySpace was done on it. To me, it was just a portable phone and anytime Mother would take it away, I would just shrug it off without giving it a second thought. I was not like most kids when it came to cell phones. On the other hand, I also didn't like wearing jeans. That's how ""different"" I was.

This happened in Junior year of High School in late 2000s.

There was a girl I was interested in and started talking to her. One day I noticed she had a cell phone and I figured I could better my chances by talking to her outside of school if I had cell phone too (I didn't get out of the house much). My birthday was close ( it is in early November) and I casually asked my mother if I could have a cell phone for my birthday and i didn't ask for anything specific, just one that i could make calls on. She tells me maybe. I reply with ""If I can, that would be awesome. If not, then don't worry about it."" My birthday comes around and no cell phone. I simply shrugged my shoulders and continued with my life. After that, my need for a cell phone just vanished.

Fast forward to Christmas morning, I was in the living room with my mother and her boyfriend and I just opened all my presents. A few minutes later, I hear a phone ringing. I merely assumed it was either my mother's or her boyfriend's phone going off so I didn't pay too much attention. Then there was a long series of them telling me that the sound was coming from one of the presents, me saying it is probably a defective toy (the present was labeled for someone else). Long story short: they got me a cell phone as a surprise present, and they were calling it. Me being completely oblivious, still figured it was defective and they should probably return it if they can. Then they reveal they were calling it and it is MY phone because I asked for one. I respond with ""I wanted one for my birthday... and I said forget about it if I didn't get one."" My mother was really confused by this.

In case you all are wondering: I did end up keeping the phone.","YTA

"AITA for not liking my parents?. I am trying to determine whether or not I am being a moody person or whether my complaints are actually justified. I feel that every time I come home to see my parents they talk about the exact same things - about the same food places they have been to, about the same garden they tend to, and about the same movies that they watch. Now, I understand that one can live a life of fulfillment and happiness by doing the same things, but, I just would think that you would need a little variation in it mentally. My parents don’t do this. They go to the same Chinese restaurant and when I ask them how it was my dad will say, “the chicken was really good” - with no other observation or note ... and it’s the same chicken dish he would get every time. Or he will comment that he would not like to go to that Chinese restaurant until 8pm, because that’s when the crowd dies - and he’ll say this nearly every time without fail if they want to go to that restaurant. It’s gotten to the point where I just feel like I am interacting with NPCs in a video game who say the same exact things over and over again. Of course I love them, but I’m just really not interested in them because they are not too interested in themselves. They’re not really passionate about anything and everything is just “good” or “bad”. They fight about nonsense, like whether or not they should pick the zucchini from the garden tonight or tomorrow. My mom, while she has good intentions, is worse. She doesn’t have a single hobby or thing that she does that she personally enjoys - she only takes pride in making sure that everyone in our family is ok. Which, while noble - is extremely suffocating to me personally (which I have said many times) and mentally unhealthy for her personally. She used to draw, hike, do things. While I understand you make sacrifices as a parent, you don’t sacrifice your ENTIRE identity. So she is always asking “hey did you get your parking pass for school?” “hey did you get new clothes?” “hey did you go to the doctor?” ... which look, I get it. She is my mom, and she cares. The problem is that is the only dialogue we have. There is no substance other than a string of anxiety inducing questions about my life. I know what I have to do, I know what I have on deck, I’m getting a bit older now. Having someone at your back reminding you of every little thing going on in your head is really taxing, mentally. Recently, I’ve learned about Myers Briggs, and I have heard that one of the worst parent-child relationships is having two sensing parents with one intuitive child. My sister is also a sensor, and I have always felt deeply misunderstood by all of them. I love them all, but I genuinely am unhappy to spend time with them. Is this unjustified, does it make me an entitled asshole?","YTA. Fuck your Myers-Briggs test.

"AITA Going on a “pancake strike” to get back at my wife. My wife and I have been married for over 10 years, together close to 15. We have several children.

Ever since we moved in together I have made her (and eventually our kids when we were blessed with them) pancakes every Saturday morning. The only time I’ve not done so is when I’ve been seriously sick or away on business. I’ll wake up at 7 and make a big pancake breakfast, honey roasted nuts, bacon etc. My father did the same thing and so it’s kind of a family tradition in some sense (not really though as my siblings have not carried it on).

About 1-2 weeks ago my wife told me that she would be going on a “sex strike” that her feminist-mom group was organising (a Facebook group where moms get together to promote feminism/organise protests).

Now I’ve never been a political person. I just want to live a happy life with my family and nothing more, but I try to be supportive of my wife since this stuff is important to her, and I’m not informed on any of this political stuff.

But this just seemed wrong to me. Ofcourse she’s not obligated to have sex with me, but it seemed like she is trying to punish me for something I haven’t done. It really sat wrong with me. After a few days I asked if the sex strike was still something she wanted to do, and she reaffirmed so. 

My response was to go on pancake strike. For the first time in our entire marriage (absent sickness or being away) my family did not awake to pancakes. They were very upset.

On the surface I think I haven’t done anything wrong. But on further reflection I think I might be the asshole because:

- Not supporting something that’s important to my wife 

- Ruining a pseudo family tradition 

- Punishing my kids to get back at my wife 

The judgement given here will determine whether my family wakes up to pancakes tomorrow. I will not contest or argue with anyone’s points.

"AITA for speaking up thinking my family is poisoning their dogs?. So we're sitting at breakfast while on a vacation and the topic of dogs came up. A couple days ago I learned on reddit that that onions among other things are poisonous for dogs. 

I wanted to talk about that earlier and this conversation reminded me, so I just blurted out ""hey mom do you give your dogs onions?"" And she says not on their own but probably when she gives the dog the leftovers of the day, so probably also garlic and whatever else. I try to explain how I think that is a really bad thing to do, and the table sort of unanimously sides against me with arguments like ""oh we feed our dogs leftovers with onions and garlic all the time and they look healthy so it can't be that bad"" or ""back in my day our dogs didn't eat anything but leftovers"" or ""my dog eats chocolate and he's still alive"". 

I get annoyed and try to push my point of view, saying that people thought smoking was healthy too back in their day, but almost everyone at the table smokes besides my sister, so it's also swept under the rug. I originally wanted to bring up cancer as well but my grandfather who's also at the table is currently in remission so I left that part out. 

I actually start getting pissed now because in my eyes they are all slowly killing their dogs and are happy about it too, but according to the rest of the table I'm the asshole for ruining breakfast and the general atmosphere of the day as early as breakfast. 

I was aggressive in my tone in the end, I kept repeating that my mom was actively killing her dog and that she should feel sorry for the poor thing. I didn't yell, but pushed on hard enough that in the end everyone was angry at me and left the table. This is a fuck up on my part. I know that especially my mom doesn't respond well to this, and it's very easy to actually completely ruin her day because she will twist it into an ""everyone is against me or hates me"" narrative. This sounds like a guilt trip, but I'm pretty sure that's how she actually experiences it.

"AITA for demanding higher pay than a disabled colleague of mine?. This morning, I found out that my co-worker and I have the same salary. My co-worker has a physical disability that affects her productivity, to a degree that is obvious to everyone in the office. This morning, I discovered that her salary is the same as mine. 

I was a bit upset because I’m way more productive and have only had outstanding evaluations. I started researching wage parity laws and discovered that up in Washington state their legislature just passed a wage parity law for workers with mental and physical disabilities. I think this is a bad idea for so many reasons, but the important thing is my state isn’t bound by this bad policy (yet). At least none that I could find.

So I met with my boss this afternoon and requested a higher salary. He said he understands my frustration and he’ll discuss the issue with HR. I told him my main issue is that I want my compensation to be reflective of my work and if it means either I get a raise or she (the disabled worker) gets a pay reduction, I’m ok with it. Obviously I don’t wish my co-worker ill will and prefer it to be a raise for me. I talked to my sister about this and she told me I was being an ass. She’s kind of PC. I really don’t feel that’s the case. I want my salary to reflect my value to the company and that is not too much to ask. Am I right? 

Edit/Info: salary for us = base salary + benefits + bonus. For the same position, the base pay will be fairly similar but it does differ depending on the hire's years of experience and negotiating skills at the time of contracts. Where there can be a rather sizeable difference is in the annual bonus.

Update: Sorry for the brief update. The mods asked me to write here since it hasn’t been a day yet. In the end, I didn’t get the raise I asked for because there isn’t anything HR can do about compensation until the next contract cycle. What I got was a lot more meaningful and lasting, however.

1. My boss was so impressed with my professionalism and courage in discussing a thorny personnel issue that he offered me additional opportunities that go beyond the scope of my current responsibilities. He had been deciding between me and another worker in the group for these professional development opportunities, but he was impressed by my discussion with him yesterday, helping him make the final decision. These opportunities will take me on work travel with him in the next few months to company-wide work groups and meetings where I will present. These opportunities are meant to increase my exposure to other parts of the corporation and facilitate interaction with folks at the executive level. He was quite frank: I’m being groomed for the next level and he has recommended me as a candidate for a position that will come up within the next year. 

2. My boss already noticed I had been editing, refining, and polishing my disabled colleague’s work product without being asked. My colleague has real productivity issues and since I already mastered my responsibilities and am more efficient, I had been covering problems created by her performance. He realized he did not document this in his last annual review and already added a letter in my file to document additional merit. This will mean more bonus supposedly. However, he now wants me to focus my extra time on professional development with him, which means my disabled colleague’s deficits will be even more apparent. Unfortunate.

3. Perhaps most important, I learned to trust my instinct. Speak up even when people might (gasp) think you’re an asshole. 

Thank you so much everyone! Lots of good news today and so glad I approached my boss yesterday!","YTA.  At first I thought NAH, but then I saw this:

"AITA for telling my kids they're allergic to sugar when they really aren't?. I have 2 kids, both in their 20s.  I've always been a single Dad since they were a toddler/infant.   

&#x200B;

I severely limit my sugar intake.  I rarely even eat fruit.  Rarely eat any carbs that aren't also high in fiber.  Its pretty much just meat and veggies.  I have raised my kids this way, more or less.  I think the sugar industry in the US is disgusting.  I think we're poisoning our kids and ourselves with how we've normalized the amount of sugar we consume.  Thats my stance, and I generally keep it to myself.  I'm not interested in criticizing others on what they put into their bodies as its none of my business.  In situations in which people try to force me to eat something with sugar is simply say, ""Can't.  I'm allergic.""  And they immediately back off.  I learned this tactic after many conversations in which people were personally offended I didn't want to eat their donuts/cookies/cakes simply because I didn't want to eat sugar.  

&#x200B;

If you have ever been a parent of small children, you know that everyone loves to dig in their pockets and give your little kids sweets. 

 This old half-wrapped werther's original that some stranger pulled out of their pocket covered in lint, I'm supposed to let my kid eat?  I always turned them down by saying my kids are allergic to sugar. Worked perfectly.  When the kids first started going trick-or-treating I said the same thing.  I took their bags and told them since we're allergic to sugar, they can only eat 1 candy a day...maybe 2 on days they're really good.  Shit lasted the whole damn year (I always checked expiration dates).  We all have other food allergies too, so it was easy to get them to believe me.  

&#x200B;

I don't even remember specifically telling them they're allergic to sugar since they were like 6.  We just lived our lives relatively sugar free.  But fast forward 20 years.  We're at a holiday get-together and someone offered my daughter, now 25, a slice of cake.  She says, ""I can't.  I'm allergic to sugar.""  Later, I pulled her aside and said, ""Taught you well, young padawan.""  She didn't get it.  I'm like dude, we're not actually allergic to sugar we just say that to people who try to force us to eat the shit, right?  I did it when you were younger, and now you're carrying the torch. 

&#x200B;

Her jaw dropped.  She was not faking it, she honestly thought they were allergic.  She yelled at me, then yelled at her brother to yell at me too.  Son didn't care, he laughed.  But Belle was pissed.  She called me a liar and other bad names.  She asked me if they were even allergic to milk.  I said, ""You tell me.  You drank 2 glasses of egg nog at thanksgiving then shit yourself?""  Its been a week and she's insisting her entire life has been a lie.  Again, my Son doesn't care.  Both of my kids are incredibly healthy.  This wasn't a lie I perpetuated throughout their lives...I honestly forgot about it.  It was just something I said when they were kids so they wouldn't eat too much sugar.","Read how many times you wrote “I”.

"AITA for using @here in a slack channel of 950 people?. The other day I was in need of some support at work and, after having gone through all of the required procedures in the 2 days prior, I posted to the support team's slack channel (not the post in question) asking the team to take a look at my support request. The post was pretty typical of such posts and it was either the first or second post of the day (even though I posted it around noon). I continue doing other work waiting for some response from the team checking back every 15 minutes or so. About 3 or 4 other posts come in slowly over the course of the next few hours. The 3 o'clock rolls around and still no response from the team on any of the other posts after mine.

"AITA for telling some comic book ""nerds"" that they're not really that knowledgeable about comics?. So, I (20M) am a 2nd year university student. 

Up until age 17, I was really overweight and not very well socialized. After getting into good shape, my looks improved a lot. I also made the effort to groom myself and dress well (I spend a lot on jackets, ripped jeans, shoes, watches) etc.

I was always a huge fan of comic books...I've read thousands of them, and still do. But unlike before, I don't LOOK like someone who is stereotypically assumed to read a lot of graphic novels.

Whereas before, I was overweight, unkempt and wore Superman T-Shirts, now I looked completely different. People usually assume other things about me now.

So my flatmate (19M) sort of fits the stereotype and he is a member of the society. He also self proclaimed ""nerd"" (term he uses). I asked him whether I could come along with him and he agreed. 

So when I arrived, I noticed I was getting weird looks from others, as if I ""shouldn't be there"". Well the society was having a debate on who would win between Batman vs Superman, and the society split into two groups. Those who thought Batman would win went into one group, and those who thought otherwise went into another.

Right off the bat, I noticed that a lot of people (on both sides) didn't really seem to know what they were talking about. They were citing non-canon comics, elseworlds stories and using out of context scans. I even pointed out the exact issue numbers and context because I had read the comics they were trying to rely on. I even cited quotes from the writers of those comics which further clarified it (also note...I was team Superman).

I got some dirty looks, but what I was saying was true. These people didn't seem to even understand basic multiverse theory, which is a pretty easy thing to grasp in comics. Or if they did understand it, they were being disiningeous and trying to pass off certain comics as canon for the mainstream continuinity. 

Afterward my flatmate and some others went for drinks so I joined them. One of the guys, we'll call Steve, was a bit hostile to me, saying that he thinks I googled this stuff beforehand. The other 3 people with him agreed. I told him that he shouldn't be salty that I'm more knowledgable than him, and that he should take it as a learning experience. Then told him and the others ""no offence but you guys don't seem to know a whole lot about comics at all"". Granted i was a bit drunk now, but seems like they just ""like comics"" for an identity, and not genuinely read comics like me. 

My flatmate after was angry at me and called me asshole. I told him that it's not my fault his friends lack knowledge. AITA?","YTA for gatekeeping their hobby.

"AITA For being vocal about my discomfort during Secret Santa Gathering. Ok so at work we had a secret Santa thing. Everyone who voluntarily signed up knew from a month and a half ago that coming to the party was a must unless it was an absolute emergency. During the gathering, everyone got their gift...except me. The girl who had me, let’s call her Nancy, Nancy had to work but promised to come straight from work at around 8:30. Alright, cool no biggie. 8:30 comes and goes. I ask who is in charge of the party is she coming? The party planner, Tallie, said “no but she will have your gift tomorrow”

"WIBTA If I politely ask my Non-Binary/Trans Friend to Change Their Name?. Alrighty strap yourselves in, this is going to be a long post.

My friend who I will refer to as X is Non-Binary.

I have been friends with X since Middle School and we're in college now. Honestly we're more like family at this point if anything.

X has been Non-Binary for about 2 years now but recently decided to change up their name since they have a traditional female name. Whether or not they choose to transition down the line, IF they want to transition down the line, I am completely accepting of it. 

My problem is, the name they chose is extremely similar to my name except one letter off. (Ex: Jaiden/Aiden, Mark/Marcus, Gaby/Gabrie)

When they told our group of friends, I was extremely uncomfortable about the name but was silent. I later confessed to my boyfriend that I have issues with it. He talked with me to get down to the real issue of my discomfort and it's deeper than face level.

I have always had an issue comparing myself to X. Intentionally and Unintentionally. I have always felt that X was the more attractive friend, more likeable, more talented etc. We're similar in tastes, hobbies, attitudes but I've always felt like people could approch them more. People always asked me about X and I've always felt like I was 2nd best to X. X felt like a brand and I was a cheap Great Value imitation of them.

I bring this up because, even though in recent years I've tried extremely hard to not compare myself to them, sharing borderline the same name with them makes it 10x harder not to.

I'm also a bit upset because awhile back they brought up the idea if they should change their name and I even half-jokingly said ""If you think about changing your name dont change it to (similar sounding name) haha ;)"" but...that's exactly what they did.

I love them but this name change hurts me. I feel extremely selfish for asking them to consider a different name but I dont think my mental health can handle it. I love them and don't want to distance myself from our 7/8 year friendship but this name is really putting me off.

"AITA for not telling my GF that my best friend and I used to flirt with each other?. This is kind of a complicated situation, so I'll try to just stick to the facts. Everyone involved uses reddit as well so throwaway, identifying details changed, etc.

I have a best friend, who we'll call A. A is an internet friend who I have known for over 5 years. A little over a year ago, A and I developed feelings for each other. We discussed it, and A told me she wasn't ready for a relationship, but we both agreed we couldn't ignore our feelings. We settled on a long distance friends with benefits. However, A got cold feet, and our FWB never developed beyond flirting and calling each other pet names. 

Fast forward about a year, and A still isn't ready to commit to even a full FWB. I'm tired of waiting and begin to feel like I'm being left on the backburner, so I end things and tell her I want to see people irl, but want to remain friends because she's an important person in my life. A admits she never committed, because she is actually legally married to a friend. She explains that it was a convenience marriage to help both become citizens (she's an immigrant and had difficulty obtaining citizenship), and now that they're both citizens they plan on divorcing and moving on with their lives, and she was just too embarrassed to tell me.
I tell A that I understand the marriage, why she did it, etc. But I also told her that I was hurt she never told me in the year I knowingly pined after her, and left me wondering what we were when it was clear she had no intentions of being in a relationship while still married. I tell her I am still willing to be her friend, but I have no interest in any sort of relationship any more, even after her divorce. Take it or leave it.

Fast forward to now. A and I have reconciled, and we're back to being best friends. I have been seeing a girl for just shy of 6 months, but I've already begun to think she may be the one.  She knows about A, she knows we're best friends, but she doesn't know A and I used to have a ""thing"" together. A hasn't ""met"" my girlfriend either because A is online, we don't share the same digital social circle, and GF doesn't really have an online presence. 

So, AITA for not telling my girlfriend I used to have a ""thing"" with my online best friend? Honestly, it was so insignificant, and A's lying to me has killed absolutely any interest in her that I just don't feel like it's relevant, but I don't want my GF to find out later down the line and be hurt if it's a bigger issue than I think it is.

edit to add info: My GF knows I am still friends with people I have had things with before, one of our mutual friends is actually someone I briefly had a fling with before I dated her, and she knows all this and is okay with this. She just doesn't know about my history with A, because it's just never come up as A is a purely digital presence. But we've been dating so long, and A and I are so close, that I don't know if I missed the window to tell my GF before it becomes suspicious and seems like I'm hiding something since I spend so much time with A, cause I am definitely not.","YWBTA Yes, if you don't tell your girlfriend, that would be unwise. The thing is, usually when people feel like they should tell their partner something, then make excuses for why they shouldn't have to, it's because they know that their partner will be upset if they do. If you don't tell your partner something that you think they'd want to know in the relationship, than you're withholding something that they need to have informed consent. So one of the following things is the case: 

\- Your GF wouldn't care that you used to have a thing for A because she's secure in herself and in your relationship in which case, you should tell her because she might be upset you kept things from her. 

\- Your GF would be upset and possibly leave you because she'd be jealous of your past relationship and is insecure, in which case you need to tell her so she can be in an informed situation and deal with it. 

So which one is it? Either she wouldn't care in which case, why aren't you sharing it or she would care and she deserves to know. 

Really everything else is just noise. It doesn't really matter what the case is. Secure and stable relationships are based on trust and if she ever finds out, she'll fell rightfully betrayed. 

Also, we as society need to get past the idea that exes can't be friends. Seriously, if we can't talk more candidly about our past, which is in the past, than we're not secure. It's especially baffling because well, if I'm friends with my ex, I obviously had the choice to be with them and am not anymore, hence the ex, and we've redefined our relationship.",1,1,0,0,0

I assured her that I’d never do something like that, so we made our first sextape and it was AMAZING. We’ve continued to do so for the past year and now we have our own little library of sextapes. However one of the rules she made when making the tapes is that she can only keep them in her possession, so all of our tapes are on her phone and her computer.

"AITA for lying to my roommates about cleaning my aquarium filter in the kitchen sink?. I've kept an aquarium since I was about 10 years old (26 now), and I've always cleaned the filter in the kitchen sink. It provides enough space and water flow control to get things clean quickly and effectively. Since I've been doing this for so long, it's safe to say I've done the act hundreds of times, and neither myself nor anyone else has ever gotten sick from it.

I've lived in my current place about four years, and it's never been a problem, but this most recent time my roommates took issue with it when I mentioned I would be using the sink for a couple hours. I've got a turtle, so the risk of salmonella is there, but I always take the proper precautions. Thoroughly clean every surface, make sure no food or dishes are nearby, wash my hands before touching anything, that sort of very basic stuff. They told me I had to do it in the bathtub from now on, which would turn a one or two hour job into four or five. I'd have to be hunched over the entire time, possibly get my feet dirty if I have to get in the tub... Plus, it's a lot less convenient for everyone to be without a bathroom than a kitchen sink for several hours. All in all, it seems really unreasonable, but they were insistent despite these points and it never being an issue before now.

So, I decided this was a case of ""ignorance is bliss"". I told them I would take care of it and not use the sink, but really I just do it in the sink when I know they aren't going to be home. I feel a bit bad for lying, but I know I can do it safely from extensive experience. I also have a very powerful aquarium filter, so it's a job that only has to be done a couple times a year. I'm not going to make the work harder than it has to be due to their fabricated idea of the risk.

*Update:* I called my sister and she will let me clean the filter in her sink. I don't know why I didn't think of that earlier.

"AITA for standing up for my sister. My sister is a inspring model. She wanted to be one since she was 13  and she started watching ANTM and fell in love with. She is 17 now and does some local shoots but nothing really big. 


A little while back a rather big clothing company started having open auditions for a charity runway show.

My sister was so excited so we went

But when we got there but thing went sour quickly 

First we waiting for 4 hours in a
long line of people. Pushing and shoving. Scream and Bitching 

And when we finally got in the judges were rude as hell.

There were four judge 3 women who look about middle age. I don't remember their women names but I believe the guy said his name was Dexton but I'm not sure. ( his name was werid )

Dude seem to be in charge of it all which was werid because he was much younger then the other.

he didn't look much older then my sister he couldn't be any older then 21. 

Once my sister was finally called up

Dexon imminently start insulting her.

He criticizes everything about her.

The way she walked the runway 

What she was wearing 

How she stood up. 
 And more.

He also insulted her style ⁹

(he called it juvenile)

He was just a all around dick

So being the good sister I jump on to defend her telling him she been modeling for over 2 years in pur town and even has 8000 followers on her Instagram.

He then rolls his eyes and say which he under his breath but I still heard 

My bosses dog has more followers then that and it is a dumb as fuck

"AITA for arguing with my wife over her preferring to sleep with a body pillow over me?. So my wife gave birth 8 months ago. During he pregnancy she was having trouble sleeping so I bought her a pregnancy body pillow that was a lot more comfortable for her. However even after giving birth she prefers sleeping with the body pillow rather than me. She just says she's used to it and finds it more comfortable to sleep with. Maybe I'm being just being dramatic but it feels like she just doesn't want to sleep with me. I'm often sleeping near the edge of the bed using a separate blanket and I just feel a lot more lonely. 


I brought all this up with her and she told me that I'm ""being more of a baby than our new born"" with all this and to just deal with it. This led to a big fight where we were both yelling at each other. I don't think either of us said anything particularly hurtful but it's not the norm in our relationship to raise our voices like we did and argue for as long as we did.  

Outside of this our relationship is more or less fine. I mean I obviously still love her and I'm sure she still loves me. 

Basically AITA for starting an argument over something like this?


This is the pillow I bought (removed link since people think I'm trying to sell the pillows lol)- 

https://imgur.com/a/fGeD2N0 (Please click this link before commenting, I think some people have misunderstood what I meant as body pillow. The one she has is more like 2 body pillows + a regular pillow) 


e: Some people seem to think that I'm jealous of the pillow. This isn't the case. I don't think she loves a pillow more than me. I just would prefer we sleep together and not with a pillow between us.

e2: I didn't think this was relevant but just so you guys know we have a nanny that takes care of the child from Sunday - Thursday. We both take turns on Friday and Saturday nights when we have to so it's not like I'm expecting her to do everything.

"AITA for not giving my seat to old people on the train?. This has happened a few times now, and I’m really not sure how to feel about it, so I figured I’d ask. 

If I’m on a crowded train, is it my obligation to look out for old people who want my seat and give it up to them? A couple times now I’ve been sitting on a crowded train and an old person has been standing right next to me looking at me apparently expecting me to give them my seat. They don’t specifically ask me for the seat, just physically imply. I try to ignore people in public so even though they were obviously looking at me, I would just turn away and pretend I didn’t notice. There are seats on the train reserved for elderly and disabled so it’s not like I have any actual obligation. If they really wanted to sit down they could just ask the people in those seats. And I’m sure if they actually asked me I would let them sit down, but they don’t. They just stare at me lol. 

I’ve spent most of my life dealing with social anxiety and as I’m trying to face it, I find myself facing the decision of whether my anxiety is telling me something is wrong, or if something is actually wrong. I often assume people are watching me as I’m just sitting there, so when I see someone looking at me, I try to tell myself that they’re not actually. When these old people look at me, I tell myself that they’re not and divert my attention, but I’m pretty sure they actually are. My own personal issues are keeping me from offering the seat, but maybe I should consider their issues that lead them to want a seat. 

So tell me, does it make me an asshole to not willingly give up my seat to old people on the train?

","Yeah, YTA. Not a huge asshole, but come on. You know that they're old, you know that they don't want to be impolite or entitled by asking you for your seat. It's common courtesy give them your seat if you have no physical limitations that would make standing difficult for you.",1,1,0,0,0
"WIBTA if I asked the father of my child (I’m 4 months pregnant, he is not my BF) not to date anyone for the next 12 months?. I don’t know if it’s just hormones making me crazy or if my concerns are reasonable so guys please tell me what you honestly think.

I’m currently 4 months pregnant with my first child. The pregnancy is accidental and the father is one of my good friends. Abortion is not an option for me and he respects that. We are on the same page about making the best of the situation, and our priority is ensuring that we can be the best parents to our child even if we’re not together. Our families are supportive of us and are excited about the prospect of a grandchild, as none of our parents are grandparents yet.

My pregnancy has not been the easiest and I recently moved in with my child’s father (I’ll call him Lance) so someone can stay with me most of the time (he works from home). We’ve been getting along well, but sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable when Lance tells me about the girls he’s talking to on Bumble. 

For the record, I don’t think he’s doing it with the intention of being rude to me. I think it’s just a habit that he’s used to - as I said, Lance and I are good friends and in the past we would always talk about the people we like or we’re seeing – maybe he just doesn’t think that anything would change now that we have a baby on the way. I get where he’s coming from and I know he still has a life to live outside of being a father to our child, but reasonably or unreasonably I feel uncomfortable that he is looking for a romantic relationship now when I think that our attention should be focused on preparing for our baby (converting a room into his nursery if we continue to live in Lance's apartment, learning how to change diapers/bathe a baby, etc). 

I’ve been thinking about asking Lance if he can hold off dating until our baby is about six months old.  I think that by that time we would have adjusted to having a baby and can have time for dating. At least that’s the timeline I’m thinking for myself, though I understand that my decisions for myself shouldn’t also automatically apply to Lance.

So would I be the asshole?","YTA - he's a friend and your room mate, not your partner.

"WIBTA for selling a beautiful gift?. I am very outdoorsy and all of my hobbies include outdoor sports/adventure. My grandmother’s love language is gift giving.

She says ok, heard, and buys me an incredibly expensive luxury watch. It’s gorgeous, elegant, and...impractical.

I also feel uncomfortable with such an expensive gift when I told her what I would like (she told me what she wanted and I stuck to it, if that matters)

My stepfather mentioned later that he knows the retail value of the watch and could sell it for me, then I could use the money to get something I could actually use and want.

"AITA for feeling smug about a friend’s husband’s life-changing injury?. I (m37) stopped talking to one of my best mates nearly a decade ago. This guy studied with me, was part of my regular (read: daily) social group as I studied at uni, and was the kingpin of my social group, which comprised a core of about six other guys and gals. I thought the world of him. We all hung out, went to bars, studied in the library together, supported each other. We were solid mates.

After the usual uni flings (none with me - we bat for different teams), my friend met a guy that he fell in love with. We’ll call him Lan. Lan was a good looking guy, friendly, funny, witheringly sarcastic, and from an upper level of the already wealthy tier that my mate was already in.

Over time, I found that my friend was being encouraged by Lan to build on his, shall we say, more elite tendencies. Both of them began to look down on those they categorised as ‘below’ them and only strived to gain more status. As time went on, I was the first (but not the last) to be pushed from my long-standing group of friends for not meeting Lan’s - now shared - ideal. 

For those of you who have separated from a friend - you my bros, and you have my sympathy. For those not - moving away from a good friend is super tough, and in a lot of ways soooo much more difficult than a gf/bf split. When they take a whole group of mates with them, it’s devastating. I ranted a lot at my (now) wife. I could be randomly brought to tears by the situation for a year - but with time and separation from them all, got over it (maybe?), moved on, founded new, just as good mates, but still feel an ache for what could (should?) have been with that group as we grew older and less stupid or whatever. My mate and Lan got married and I was not invited, which is understandable. The gulf between us was too great by then.

Today I heard that  a few weeks ago, Lan fell off something at a bar and broke his back. The prognosis is that he could be paralysed from the waist down for the rest of his life.

I have no contact with Lan, his husband (my former mate) and extremely limited contact with his social circle, but I feel...vindicated. Not quite gleeful, but definitely like karma’s been delivered.

-SIL is recovering well (conscious, eating, talking, etc.) at hospital (3 hours from work) with mom and employee’s wife at bedside.
-Employee is trying to justify missing work for two weeks because they have to take care of child while wife is at hospital with sister and mom.

My POV: Wife does not need to be at bedside 24/7 if sister is recovering well AND mom is there. Wife can take care of child as usual and call husband if something urgent comes up.

Side note, this company only grants sick days when verified by a doctor’s note, pre-approved vacation days, and emergency time for when an immediate family member is terminally ill/has died.

Your reasoning is also faulty. You claim that this employee shouldn't need to take off full days of work so his wife can be away ""24/7,"" but it doesn't sound like you're giving him *any* time off.

"AITA For Not Wanting My Best Friend's Fiancée at My Wedding?. So, a little background: I have two extremely close friends who I have known for a really long time (once since I was, like, 2 years old, and once since I was about 16). We're all in our thirties now. My oldest friend, let's call her Jessie, is married and has kids. My other friend, let's call her Molly, has a boyfriend that she has been with for about 3 years.

I've never really liked Molly's  fiancée. He's not a bad guy, but—well, you know when you just can't click with someone? And being around them makes you insanely uncomfortable, no matter how hard you try? And I really feel like I've tried over the last few years as well. He just does small things that bother me; like, I always think he's a bit controlling. Never outwardly aggressive or mean, but sometimes passive aggressive and occasionally manipulative (albeit only over small things, from what I've witnessed). Anyway, I digress...

So I recently got engaged and my boyfriend and I are planning on a destination wedding abroad. Neither of us are close to our families, and we only have a handful of very close friends between us, so we're arranging something really small and intimate for those who can/would like to come (and a larger party for our extended circle of friends when we get back).

The reason I mentioned Jessie at the beginning of this post is because she has already asked if her kids are invited to the intimate wedding. I said of course—her kids are like my nephews (she has three boys)—and her husband will come to the bigger party later on.

When Molly mentioned bringing her fiancée, I told her it was going to be a more intimate gathering and said that Jessie's husband is sitting it out. But when I told her that Jessie's kids are coming, she got really angry with me and said I was being unreasonable for leaving her fiancée out. I have made it clear that he's welcome to the larger party, I would just prefer to not have him at the ceremony.

Am I being the asshole?

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

To make it clear: no partners were ever invited to the wedding. If everyone was bringing their partners, I would not exclude anyone. This was more about Molly losing it because Jessie is bringing her kids, so she felt like she should be able to bring her fiancée. We have discussed it and reached a compromise—our friendship existed long before the men in our lives, and I'm fortunate that we're not going to lose each other because of this situation.

&#x200B;

Thank you everyone for your comments.","YTA

Taking a guess here, Jessie's husband probably can't go until the bigger party for one reason or another. So using that as an example as to why Molly's SO can't come is flimsy at best.

"AITA for not being a ride or die for my close friend when she expected me to?. So there's this girl at my school that I recently became friends with like 2 months ago. She's an amazing person, but the thing is she's been getting into a lot of drama and thus a lot of people hate her.

I make jokes about this to her, saying stuff along the lines of ""I spoke with your best friend today"" or ""I heard your best friend has a little friend crush on me"".

This coworker and I have gotten pretty close over the past year and we’ve been teasing each other back and forth about me cooking spaghetti. I’m 3rd generation Italian American and I’ve brought spaghetti to work events 3 times but he always missed it because he was at school or out of the store for some reason or another.

So we’ve had this ongoing joke about me making spaghetti for him. So a few days ago he randomly texted me and asked about it and I had the ingredients so I made him basically a pot of spaghetti. 

I told my boyfriend about it when my coworker texted me to say how good it was and he got pissy with me about it. Now suddenly he has an issue with me having picked up this coworker and driven him to work a few times and with he and I having lunch together and apparently he came to our job once and saw us hug and he’s been upset about it for months.

"AITA For getting annoyed at my wife when she wants to stay up all night?. My wife and I go to bed together each night together and get up at roughly the same time. She is an expat and messages her brother through Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. On the rare occasion he is free to play games with her and talk to her on skype. Because of the time difference between her and her brother (7 hours) it can be difficult to arrange these sessions.

I try to justify this with her and explain its important that we go to bed at the same time, because 1. I have a hard time sleeping if not next to her and 2. It has been expressed that going to bed at different times in a relationship can be detrimental to the relationship itself - it can spiral out of control and become a habit. She doesn't appear to agree to these points and tells me that she thinks the 'situation itself' is shitty.

"AITA for refusing to take my 11-year-old brother trick or treating or to stay home and hand out candy?.

Basically, what I'm saying is that it's pretty generally safe all around. And besides, I got invited to a Halloween party. Not to sound cringy, but recently I've become a lot more popular (had a growth sport and gained a lot of muscle so I'm taller and my body and face look better, and also started playing soccer), so I'm getting invited to stuff for the first time.

You're not an asshole for wanting to go to a Halloween party, but you're also not in the position to make those decisions without your mom's approval. 

I suggest trying for a compromise - get an early start on trick-or-treating so you can make the party. If you started at 6 you could get in 2 hours of candy grabbin and head to the party at 8 - could it really start much earlier than that?

"AITA for reporting a Pitbull for being a banned dog breed?. This isn't something I did btw, my aunt was the one who reported the dog and my mum and I were fighting over wheather or not she was an asshole for doing so. 

&#x200B;

My aunt reported her neighbour because he had a 5 year old female dog that looks like a Pitbull, which is a banned breed here in Northern Ireland. This dude is in his mid-20's with a six month old baby and doesn't have any record as far as we're aware. My aunt didn't report the dog because she feared for anyone's safety but because this lad is apparently quite racist and homophobic and also holds loud parties so she wants to teach him a lesson. Also apparently the dog barks a lot so she wants to stop this happening, so she reported him to the local dog warden. Nothings happened yet, though.

&#x200B;

My mum said at the end of the day he shouldn't have broken the law by keeping a banned dog so if anything happens (which it hasn't yet) it's totally on him, and if he walks her and a policeman sees she'll be taken anyway so h\]my aunt is just speeding up the inevitable. But as far as I'm concerned she was a massive asshole for making the dog a victim because she had a problem with it's owner.  I also worry about what will happen to the dog because idk what happens if a banned breed is taken from its owner.

"AITA Car Dealer couldn't wait 4 days for a 90% down payment?. My wife got into a car wreck on an icy road when a little old man (82) tagged her in the passenger-side back wheel. No injuries, everyone was going like 5mph. Her car was 15 years old so it was totaled out for about $1900. More than we deserved to get, lemme tell you, for that old 2003 rust bucket of hers.

&#x200B;

So, we started shopping for cars, spending the next two or three weeks cashing in stocks, savings, emergency monies and so on and so forth. Enough for about 80-90% of the price tag on a *2018 Chevy Sonic LT*\-- a serious upgrade compared to my wife's old car. All the bells and whistles, a spacious hatchback, keyless, you name it! Me and the entire family were thrilled with the idea-- and happy to get her OUT of that deathtrap so she didn't have an accident at 65mph, and not 5mph.

&#x200B;

We went to the dealership, told them our situation and took it for a test drive. It was like a dream. Soft, warm, 5-miles-on-it brand new. My wife fell in love with it immediately. When we got back, we told the salesman that we had one more check in the mail, coming in to combine with all of our monies so we could put down $12-13k out of the $15.8k needed to buy this new, luxurious, beautiful car. We test-drove on Friday, we would have the check and be ready to sign Wednesday.

&#x200B;

The dealer sold the car the next day, on Saturday, to someone else.

&#x200B;

TODAY (Tuesday, the day before our intended buy date), he called us wanting to know if there was some other car we might be interested in. I berated, yelled, and made very very sure he knew how unhappy we were. My wife didn't know what to do, since that was the car she'd always wanted, since college (not sure WHY a chevy sonic is her dream car, but I'm not a car guy so I dunno....) I laid into this guy, mostly out of frustration for how sad my wife was at the turn of events, and REALLY made sure he knew we would not be conducting business with him anymore, regardless of our car needs.

&#x200B;

I understand the idea of how unappealing ""I will gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger today"" is, and I understand he has to run a business, but the lack of empathy REALLY stings. My wife and I take very good care of our vehicles, so we might get two, maybe three cars in our lifetime. I understand he has a business to run and someone with a check in their hand today is much, much better than someone with a check in their hand four days from now... but I felt really betrayed and super, super pissed off.

&#x200B;

""Am I the Asshole"" for laying into this guy really, really hard over the phone for dashing our plans two days beforehand, and not having the stones to tell us about it until the day before--- then trying to get us to buy something else from his lot?

"AITA for me [16m] to explode at a teacher who put a false report on my record?. So basically I had a sub one day and I just sit there doing the assigned work.

And then to my surprise, the next lesson I come on and my regular teacher wants to talk to me and the other boys in my row after the class. This teacher knows I’m well behaved and everyone else vouched for me, however, to my surprise I heard the teacher had put me on record for being noisy and disruptive when I was just working.

I knew that teachers name and his staff room due to a friend having him and I marched up their immediately after I heard that and started talking to him. I said that he had mistaken me for the other noisy guys in my row and requested he remove the infraction. He denied and said he saw me being noisy.

Rather than taking it back immediately for the correct burrito, I instead ate about ¾ of it before taking it back. I figured they were going to throw it out anyway, so why not finish most of it?

"AITA for not talking to my girlfriend while the meal at the restaurant is getting prepared?. This didn't happen recently but it came to my mind after reading about the steak post and I always was curious to see other people's thoughts on the matter. 

  
First, a bit of background: 

Basically what had happened was that we had spent the entire day together going out and exploring the city. It was late at night and we were both hungry so a lot of things were closed. We finally found a restaurant and we sat down and ordered our stuff. 

&#x200B;

Now, I didn't have headphones at the time and I wanted to see some video, can't remember what, so I asked her if I could borrow hers. She wasn't using them at the time and she declined. I could tell she was visibly annoyed, so I asked her what was up and she commented that we're at the restaurant together and we should speak to each other instead of being on our phones. 

&#x200B;

Which, don't get me wrong, normally I do agree with, if this was just a run of the mill date and our first time hanging out together I'd spend that time with her.

&#x200B;

However, I told her that we'd literally just spent the entire day together, our meals weren't even here yet, and I wanted to relax by watching a few videos / browsing my phone before the meal came because as much as I love her even I have a hard time speaking for an entire day on end and I just wanted a 10 or so minute downtime.

&#x200B;

Anyways, we argued about it and it soured the mood the entire day as we spent the entire meal not speaking to each other. Pretty shitty way to end off the day given how great it was before.

&#x200B;

TL:DR - Me and my GF spent the entire day together and during the time the meal was being prepared at the restaurant I spent it on my phone watching YT and we got into a huge fight about it. 

&#x200B;

"AITA girlfriend was in a fender bender. My girlfriend exaggerates a lot, and most of the time I can never gauge how serious a situation is. I got a text from here earlier to today, ""I was just in a car accident."" Obviously extremely vague, but nonetheless I freaked out. I tried to call her multiple times with no answer. Apparently she was talking to a cop. She told me everybody was fine, but other than that I had no way of telling if she had just been plowed by an eighteen wheeler or bumped in the rear on a turn. So I continued to panic until I saw a picture she sent of the accident.

According to her story, a man had waved her on at an intersection and she went and the guy started to go too early and gained too much speed. The man hit into the back right wheel-well. Picture showed a small dent and some scratches.

So after hearing this I was extremely relieved. I told her how scared she had made me and how glad I was she was okay. She hasn't been talking to me all day very much. She is acting as if this was some life traumatizing experience and she can't handle any interaction at the moment. She cancelled plans with me and all I got from her after she got back from work was ""Sorry, I'm gonna shower and get some sleep"" (This was 8 o'clock). 

So, am I an asshole if I am getting annoyed? I understand this may have scared her. It would have scared me too. But I, and most other people, would just move on, being thankful nothing bad happened. If it's worth mentioning, I don't buy her story about the 'accident'. She is not a very good driver and I feel like she was probably to blame for part of it.

He told me he would do whatever he wanted. I walked back to my table. He followed me and proceeded to record me on his phone, saying very loudly ""this is another example of the white man trying to keep a ni**** down."" (Seriously)

I have had my septum piercing for 2 years, everyone in the family knows I have it and has seen me wear it. My sister told me I can’t wear it during the wedding ceremony &amp; for pictures.

The thing is, my septum is one of those VERY small silver ones. It is not one of those ginormous, distracting ones that sticks out like a sore thumb.

"AITA for wanting my wife to smell my underwear? (posting for my stepdad). Disclaimer: First, I'm not 100% sure this is allowed since I wasn't directly involved and second if the title isn't clear enough, this is my stepdad.

"AITA for telling my mother to move into a bigger apartment?. Throwaway to stay anonymous.

As my parents split up a few years ago, my mother had to move out of the apartment that she used to live in with me and my sister back in the days (our father had moved out earlier already and my sister and me also already left). 

As my father always earned enough money with his business, she had stopped working when she was pregnant with me about 28 years ago. Also, she never started again. So, due to her financial situation after splitting up and to begin with, she moved into a small apartment, one room. That seemed to be the best option for the time being. However, she still lives in the same small apartment since then. About 4 years now that is.

In the meantime, she found a good job again, earns reasonably well and - in my opinion - could and should move into an apartment that would be more appropriate for a woman that is 60.

Despite the fact that she says she is happy with her situation, I just can't buy that. I feel that she should have more space, a proper kitchen, a separate room to sleep, etc. etc. 

Also, and that is where I might be the a-hole, I feel that I can't ever bring my girlfriend or kids (in case I become father) to her. I was in a relationship for the last two years and I always avoided bringing her home to my mother as that would be a terribly awkward situation. We would have nothing to cook together, no proper table to eat. So we'd probably end up warming something up in the microwave and then sitting on her couch eating it. I'd feel embarrassed kind of, too. I feel the strong urge to bring my girlfriend (maybe family one day) to my mother and spend time together. I really want that. However, we always met somewhere else, theater, restaurant, etc. Further, I couldn't bring my kids to her grandmother as she simply would have no space for them. Though, I remember the times being with my grandmother and I consider it valuable and very important time of my life. She passed away too soon and I don't want my future kids to miss time with their grandmother when she is still fit enough. 

I recently met a new girl and I'm facing the same situation again. Can't really bring her home.

So me and my sister tell our mom to move into something more appropriate. She doesn't do it though. She lives quite in the city center and enjoys that. Maybe that would change a little as rents are bananas where we live and you'd clearly get more value if moving to a somewhat less central area.

She was diagnosed officially last year, but we really already knew. She has nightmares and flashbacks and if someone yells around her, she almost always cries. She has more symptoms but these were the main ones that led us to believe she probably had it before she was officially diagnosed.

It would be a whole week where I would live at their house, and basically only leave for work and to go to the grocery store, so that my sibling would have as little time left alone as possible. It’s not something that is particularly hard, just... really really emotionally draining. They also asked me to do a few small things around the house. So, I did. And when they came back, I sorta expected I’d get paid for the whole week. But when it came to talking about payment, they only asked me how many hours I’d spent doing the small things they’d asked. No mention of the week that I’d put my life off to watch my sibling. The small stuff had only taken maybe an hour, and I honestly would have felt more shitty to have been paid like $30 for that whole week than to not have been paid for any of it, so I told them not to worry about it.

TLDR: 3 good friends and I are taking a trip and a fifth friend invites himself but says he'll have a hard time spending a month in my company. A sixth friend then asks to join and 2 of us want to accept and the other 2 want to decline to spare the fifth friend's feelings. I wanna insist on bringing him along, potentially making me an asshole.

Long version:
My three good friends and I are going on a month-long trip in a few days. I'll call us A, B, C and D, A being myself. B was the one who planned the trip and asked the rest of us to come along. 

We all have these two close friends, we'll call them E and F. E was invited to come along, but had to decline due to uncertainty about whether he could make it work with his work and personal life. F wasn't invited, as he's fun in small doses, but quickly gets stressful being around for long periods of time. E is an extremely good friend of me and B, and F is a good friend of B's and gets along decently with the rest, except me. I've always found him a bit annoying and he feels the same way about me. 

Anyway F talked with B and kind of invited himself on the trip, saying he'd love spending the month with us, but was unsure if he'd manage being around me for so long. No hard feelings towards him, it's mutual and not hateful. B declined and told F that he'd only wanna go on the trip with people who get along well. F has a bit of an abandonment issue and gets a bit sad, but takes it well.

Shortly after, E finds out that he's able to come along as well. I get very excited by this, and tells him that I'll hear the rest of the group what they think. B and C are close with F, so they feel that inviting a friend after declining F's proposal to tag along would be a bit too harsh on F and want to avoid the drama and conflict. D and I are fine with inviting E along as there's no reason that he shouldn't come. This discussion goes on a while, and ultimately ends with B and C refusing to invite someone else, since they have to confront F and don't want to hurt his feelings and their friendship, although the acknowledge the injustice of E getting declined over F's stupid remark about me.

When I used to argue with her she’d always say she used to wash it more than me (being the older AND clean the bathroom which she doesn’t do anymore). She also has night classes and works late. My mom usually sided with her and let’s her take a bath first and makes me wash the dishes even when we both come home late.

"AITA for choosing my cheating friend over another friend in our friend group?.  Since high school, I have had the same tight-knit friend group of 4 people (I’m 22). A few years ago, one of my buds, Nick, has gotten a girlfriend, let’s call her Tracy. 

Tracy actually got pretty close to most of us and hung out with us whenever we hung out together. I didn’t *particularly* care for her. She was nice enough, but we didn’t have anything in common, and I didn’t find her sense of humor very funny (she liked to tease me a lot about my height).

They dated for about 2 years, when they broke up because Tracy found Nick sleeping with his ex. They apparently have been sleeping with each for a couple weeks, when Tracy found Nick at a local motel thanks to Find My IPhone. 

Obviously the group is affected. Tracy wants nothing to do with Nick (understandably) and didn’t want to be in the same room as him. 

The issue is that we play Dungeons and Dragons every Friday. Tracy pretty much expected to be able to still come (so it’d be her, me, and friend 3/friend 4 which I’ll call Friends). I told Friends in a group text that if Tracy wants to hang, they 3 can just hang while I’ll just go ahead and hang with Nick by myself. 

Friends asked why we couldn’t hang out with Stacy occasionally and I just told them that I just didn’t really want to. That we pretty much only hung out with her because Nick brought her along, and now that she’s no longer with Nick, there’s no reason to hang out with her. This started an argument which leaded to Friends telling Stacy what I said. 

They are **FURIOUS** that I’m “on his side” after what he did to her and that I’m cruel for cutting her out of my life like that. I told Stacy that I would’ve told her a lot more tactfully, but I didn’t really consider her that close a friend, and that she’s nice and all, but we had nothing in common and I rather hang out with my actual friend. 

They called me a piece of shit and posted about how I rather hang with a cheater than them on Facebook. I responded to that post and told her that she was a crazy stalker who used a tracking device on her boyfriend and needed to leave me alone. She blocked me on everything after that and there’s a lot of annoying drama and everyone’s pissed off.","YTA.

"WIBTA if I told my best friend I don’t feel like we’re best friends anymore. Totally middle school I know but I don’t feel like we’re as close. Me and my best friend have been friends for 8 years and she’s always been friends with my family as well. My sister and her were friends but not close but since my best friend had a baby, I’ve been pushed to the side and my sister (who has two kids) has bonded with her about having kids. I don’t have kids and I don’t have a problem with them being friends (my sister is one of my best friends as well) but I can tell we’re not as close. They’re both stay at home moms and I work immensely and I’ve noticed I’ve been starting to learn things about my best friend through my sister instead of straight from my best friend or that our conversations don’t really hold up very well but my sister and her are constantly in contact. I can accept this because they’re both in the same state in life and I’m not and it’s okay. The problem is every once in a while my best friend will tell me I’m her best friend as if she’s reminding me but I don’t feel like I am. I want to tell her that I don’t feel like we are but I also know she’ll tell my sister and I don’t want to feel like anything’s a competition or that we can’t all be best friends or like there’s any problem.

Why do you feel the need to correct her? Additionally, she could still see you as a best friend. STAHM typically do not have the same friend network as those that do not have children simply because being a STAHM is a full time gig.

"AITA for wanting a dog camera?. So I live in an apartment with two other girls. One of them I’m close with, the other I’m not (she’s a horrible roommate). Well, I just recently adopted a dog a few months back and I got a camera (an expensive one) so that I can keep an eye on her during the day/ when the dog sitter is there. Originally we were going to put the camera on the top of the kitchen cabinet which overlooks the living room but my close roommate wasn’t comfortable with that so I thought we compromised and decided it would just be directly on my dogs crate (and it would not show anything but her crate). We have discussed this a few times all three of us and each time Ive brought it up she says it’s totally okay. Now that I’ve bought the camera, she now has an issue with it. Also when we are home, it would be unplugged and not in use. Well, she’s not comfortable with that either because it makes the apartment less “homey”. She also got all defensive when I told her I wanted it for my dog so during the day I can keep an eye on her to see what she’s doing AND when none of us are at the apartment on the weekends. She is gone most weekends anyways. Am I the asshole for feeling like if it’s just on my dogs crate than it doesn’t really matter if she doesn’t want it or not since it won’t affect her? I could put her crate in my room, but my roommate lets my dog out when she’s home and I’m not. 

EDIT: THE CAMERA WOULD ONLY BE ON HER CRATE AND WOULD BE UNPLUGGED WHEN WE ARE HOME.

Would having the camera in the living room when no one else is there on weekends be her decision, too? Even if she’s not there?

"WIBTA if I was to fake tuning a sub so I resonated my Neighbor out of his house?. I have been joking about doing this all day on r/rant so some background.

My neighbor’s lawn service was out at 6:30AM with lawnmowers going, causing my dogs to go crazy and waking me on my day off.

My neighbor has asked me in the pass not to be working in my shed or garage after 7:00 pm, because he is afraid, I will wake his kids. I really think it has nothing to do with kids but everything to do with he wants peace and quiet while he relaxes when he gets home.

I finished a 15 sub-cabinet yesterday was going to take it to my friend’s tomorrow to tune it before the bike rally in a few weeks.

I figure that my driveway is about 25 feet from his front door, the distance it takes to develop a full 45Hz wave, If I remember right the size of his Livingroom should resonate 45 Hz very nicely.

"AITA for essentially forcing my sister to be more active/do a sport?. Hi everyone. I don’t normally post but I’m a little torn on this and wanted some outside feedback.

Background: I’m a recent graduate, college aged, and just moved back home. I have a younger sister [13] and a single mother [47]. 

I’ve always taken a somewhat active role in my sisters life growing up and pushed her to be a better person. While she is a little older now then when I was around more (my uni was 5 hours away from home) she is still very much a kid in my eyes. After coming home and having some time off where I’ve been basically home all day the past two weeks I realized that my sister has been basically just going to school and then coming back home after and immediately doing almost nothing. On the contrary she just comes home and drinks sodas, eats pretty unhealthily, and plays video games for the majority of the day (thank god she does homework) and then goes to sleep. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with playing video games or the occasional soda as I do those things myself sometimes but like everything it is important in moderation. My mother is naturally a push over and growing up myself I took full advantage of that by pretty much doing whatever I wanted and missing a lot of school which is a pattern she seems to be repeating. When I was her age I also wanted to do what she is doing now but my grandfather essentially forced me to pick up BJJ and while I hated it at first I learned to love it and it helped me grow confident and I’m extremely thankful. She continually expresses to me that she doesn’t like ANY sports and I think it’s because she is either A. A lazy kid that would rather play video games (understandable) or B. Hasn’t really tried any sport long enough to learn to like it. She has interests in art and photography outside of just school which is amazing and I fully support it but it’s not the same as getting out of the house and meeting other people while doing something healthy in my opinion. I just want what’s best for her and want to know if me pushing her to do something she might not want to do at first makes me the asshole and if it’s even my place as her older brother to do so.

Edit: I just want to encourage her to do something but to get the initial motivation I feel like I would have to force her out of the house to try something. I could be wrong.","YTA if you're forcing her. You know what it's like at that age - the more someone tries to force you to do stuff, the more you'll resent them for it.

"AITA for posting an AITA when my gf told me not to?. (throwaway account) 

So, a little context. My girlfriend and I had conversations a while back while looking through Reddit, and she was telling me how she personally wouldn’t feel comfortable with me posting on this subreddit about anything going on in our relationship, because in her words, she trusts that I would go to her or my friends to talk about it instead of posting it on Reddit.  

Well, about a week ago, we had some issues in our relationship that turned into a full blown argument. I will admit that instead of going to her about it, I ignored the situation (and just kept telling her it was whatever), and made an AITA post over the entire argument after I’d went to my friends. 

Today, she was on Reddit, browsing r/Confessions. everything was fine until she just kind of.. walked out of the room and put down my phone. I wanted to know what was wrong, and she told me that we should talk about something. She wasn’t angry — at least, I don’t think she was. But I’d realized that she had found the post I made while looking through my mentions. 

She was more disappointed that I had lied to her about it, and that I had posted it after knowing she didn’t like it. But I was angry, and I wanted validation for the argument.

"AITA for feeling entitled over my parents because I feel at a disadvantage over my step family?. TLDR - Panicking about the future if I ever wanted to be part of my parents lives which would have to sadly include their new families. I feel at a disavantage emotionally, financially and well being wise. I have decided to access therapy.

I have decided to seek out therapy sessions to discuss my feelings. Thank you everyone. 

Dad married my Stepmother 3 years ago. 
My Mum married my Stepfather not long after. 

Recently as I am 16 I am more conscience of the future.
In their wills me and my step siblings will het the ""same"" but as their biological child I don't see how that is just... Then I realised their spouses get half which then gets passed onto THEIR biological children. My parents own a fair bit but their spouses don't. 
When my parents die I won't get any say over anything about how we should send them off as their spouses will get full control and will be backed up by their numerous biological children.

Make the kinds of choices that lead you toward your own financial stability. Then, when the inevitable occurs, whatever inheritance you end up with won't matter.

"AITA told my girlfriend she should consider getting help for self esteem issues?. Bit of a backstory, we often get into discussions which turn to debates and then arguments about how she looks. I think shes gorgeous and wouldn't change her for the world, however if she wishes to improve herself I am fully supportive. She knows this. 

I tell her every day I think shes beautiful, because I genuinely do. That doesn't cut it for her though. There are plenty of comparisons to other women, over analysis of other women and other situations, paranoia regarding me cheating when I move away later this year, jumping to conclusions, etc.  

So in our most recent conversation, turned argument, she sent me a video of a feminist speech. The segment I saw was of the woman telling other women how they are ""told to look a certain way"" and ""forced to be a certain way"". In modelling, acting, or careers alike this may be true. But not in general life. The biggest problem I had with this though is that she said ""society tells us we arent good enough"". I believe we are our own worst enemy, in order to succeed we must overcome that voice in the back of our head saying we arent good enough or that we cannot do it. I don't think blaming everyone else on that is fair. 

If one wants to better oneself physically then they must find it in themselves to dedicate themselves to it. Rather than blame society for telling you you arent good enough. 

As the debate progressed I told her that in order to feel healthier and happier you must overcome self esteem issues and seek help. Much like those who suffer from anxiety and depression should seek help. 

My girlfriend didn't like the sound of that and told me she couldn't believe I was making her out to be a mental case. I didnt argue back, I told her the way she acts isn't healthy and causes her a lot of upset. I know its not her fault, and have told her this, but I think professional help would definitely help. 

As long as I've known my girlfriend she has had these self esteem problems. I thought because she had never really had a real relationship, this could help her. But jealousy and paranoia (probably due to immaturity as it's her first relationship) kind of took over and left us here. 

Am I wrong for suggesting she gets help?


Edit: I have been told that I'm part of the problem and I'm ridiculous for suggesting such a thing. Is the argument worth having or do I just leave it for tonight?","NAH but Dude, A couple of points.


A) Stop invalidating her opinions


>we often get into discussions which turn to debates and then arguments about how she looks

"WIBTA for Asking My Sister to Stop Posting Progress Pics in a New Year's Resolution Facebook Group?. At the end of last year, my family decided that, in order to stay motivated and keep our Facebooks from becoming just about whatever our resolutions are, we made a Facebook group. Everyone is supposed to be welcome, which is part of why I'm hesitant to say anything. 


My sister is super thin. Like size double zero thin. She's also what my family affectionately calls a health nut. She does the whole plant-based, whole food, no oil thing, pretty much only drinks water, etc. etc. If you ever need advice on anything health or fitness related, she's a godsend, though. That's another issue. If I upset her, and she leaves the group altogether, then a lot of people will be pissed at me for ""running her off.""


The thing is that most of the people with fitness-related resolutions have decided to post weekly progress pics. And mostly that doesn't cause any issues. But then my sister is there, her waist maybe two feet around, and she's posting pictures each week. She's doing some sort of year-long push-up challenge; it's like 100 push-ups each day plus the day of the year. On 31 Dec., she's going to do 466. 


Anyway, the issue for me is that I don't think anyone that thin needs to be posting progress pics. She says it's to show her muscles growing in definition and all that, but all I see whenever I log into the group is an already skinny woman flaunting herself. And it makes me feel uncomfortable and unwilling to check the group's posts, even more than dealing with the constant posts about macros and calories and the really ""strong"" memes the fitness-resolutioners often post. I just want to see makeup and the like (my own resolution was not to buy any new lipsticks, eyeshadow, etc. this year). Instead, I get assaulted with all of these things I try to avoid, and her pictures are the worst. 


I just, would I be the asshole to ask my sister to stop posting progress pics, even though she's not technically doing anything wrong?","YTA...You seem to have some real issues with thinking that she looks better than you or other people.

"AITA for not wanting to wait in the waiting bay at McDonald’s drive through?. At about 2am a week ago, I decided to get some late night McDonalds. It was raining and the place was deserted. Once I ordered and got to the pick up window, the employee told me that it would be a about 5 minutes for fresh fries and asked if I could wait in the waiting bays and that she would bring the food, which was perfectly fine. Considering it was raining, I decided to stay at the window so the employee didn’t have to walk out in the rain to give me my order. I figured it would be fine as long as I kept looking behind me to see if any cars came through behind me, in which case I would have moved.

About two minutes later, she comes back to the window and tells me that “the waiting bays are over there.” I respond asking that “there’s no one behind me, so can I just stay here?” She then shakes her head and says “could you just park over there?”.

So recently my mum and dad were contacted by a woman who explained my brother had gotten her daughter pregnant and she had a baby. DNA was done and the baby is my bros. So I met the baby with my mum and dad and all goes well, brother doesnt want anything to do with the baby and is talking about it and refuses to meet the baby and has blocked the baby's mum on social media. My mum and dad had previously met the baby before I had met the baby. My brother been in a relationship with another girl for roughly 11 months almost a year I think, the baby is 2 weeks old, So strong chance he cheated. His GF is lovely naive and stays with my brother at my mum's house a lot. She doenst know about the baby. So my mum's refusing to tell her and my brother won't talk about it or acknowledge this is real and he needs to tell his GF. So my mum and dad have known for like a month, my mum won't say shit to my bro because he's little golden child. She also hasn't told any of our extended family only her mum, I was told she had told her family after I was told. So when I met the baby and obviously took pictures because hello cutie and I'm an aunt. I put a post up on Facebook saying she was my niece, I didn't tag anyone or say it was my brothers (I don't have any other siblings) but I've posted about my fiancees niece and nephew a lot and call them mine, because I am their aunt. Not 2 minutes later my mum calls my screaming about how I'm an asshole and how dare I do this to her because she hadn't told anyone else (I was previously told she wasn't keeping the baby a secret and didn't know she hadn't told her family). So I agree to take the post down but say I'm putting it back up on Sunday or after so she has time to tell her family. 
I just wanna know am I an asshole here? Or do you guys have any advice on this situation? Also yes I have my brothers current GF on Facebook which was a part of the reason I did post it because I knew she would see and my say something to my brother because I've been threatening telling her since I've known about a week and I've told him he needs to tell her.

Edit: I think I've confused most people because so just to clarify:
I didn't post so his GF would see but I knew that was a possibility and tbh wasn't bothered about it, cause I didn't say anything other than something like ""meet my lovely little niece last night"" and didn't tag anyone or say it was his I've posted the same stuff about my fiancees niece.
Bro has known about the baby for months and didn't tell any of us until the girls parents tracked my mum and dad down.
I've known for about a week, the baby's mum gave permission for the photo and has announced the baby herself. Bro doesn't want anything to with baby and won't acknowledge it.
Will give other updates and I did take the post down after my mum called and explained I wanted to give her time to tell her extended family.","YTA, your mum is right, its not your place.

"AITA for arguing what I owe on a shared bill?. So today I went out to a friends birthday brunch. The other people in the story with fake names are:

Me (20F)

Sam: My old friend (22F)

Natalie: Birthday girl who I met through Sam when we were all kids (22F)

Boris (23M): Natalie’s boyfriend

Ally (21F) and AJ (27M): a couple and the only two other people that know Natalie from outside of school

The remaining 17 or so people were all from Natalie’s school and all range from 22-25. To me they were all strangers and didn’t talk to me, Sam, Ally, or AJ at all during the three hours we ate. 

Brunch was 25$ all inclusive with unlimited mimosas. If you just got brunch without the drinks, it was 10$ less. Me being 20, I just got brunch.

Everyone else got brunch with drinks, in addition to buying some extra cocktails. 
Then dessert rolled around and I treated myself to a 9$ creame brûlée and everybody else except Sam got some sort of cake. 

The bill comes and I ask to see it since it’s all inclusive. We all agreed to split Natalie’s bill so I got into calculating how much I owe with tips and taxes and factoring in her 25$ brunch and 5$ dessert. I figure I owe close to 30$. 
But instead Boris just divided the total bill by the amount of people at the party which turned out to be a bit more than 40$. I mention that I didn’t get any drinks and already calculated my total, same with Sam. He very loudly sighs and grunts and says something along the lines of “well that messes everything up now, what am I supposed to do?”
He starts calculating, and his friend very mockingly says “you do know we’re all paying for Natalie right?” I say yes, I did calculate that. 

Boris first asks me “are you sure you don’t wanna split with everyone? It’s only 39$ without your drinks” I say no it shouldn’t be that much. 

Apparently included tip was 20% when I calculated for 16% (mostly because the wait staff was rude and didn’t bother with me and Sam, probably because we didn’t order drinks)

So I recalculate and it ended up being a couple dollars more than I initially thought, around 34$. Eventually Boris also came to that conclusion but not without some pushback. By that point I was so annoyed that I just rolled my eyes and said “fine I’ll pay that but I need change”. Nobody budged, and I kept on asking for change because I didn’t trust I’d get it back after. I loudly say I’ll ask the server for change, but Boris yells “just cover Sam and have her break your ten!” I did it but I gave him the money very aggressively.

Then after arguing with me, he also told Ally and AJ to pay an extra 10$ for the brûlée they had just received late and the server said was “on the house”. He argued that they still ordered it before the bill, so it must have been charged. They didn’t argue at all but just paid for it. 

I was high during this so I really couldn’t tell if I was rude, but AITA for arguing for a couple of dollars rather than going along with it?

EDIT: formatting

EDIT 2: just to clear this up although it doesn’t make a difference, my final total was 34 not 36 (originally I calculated 30 and was told to pay 42 and then 39) No fits were thrown just a small argument. We stayed relatively civil, just both of us going back and forth on a total. 

I texted Natalie, she said she didn’t even notice and everything is fine. She chalked it up to a small disagreement and that’s that.","YTA in my opinion. It seems kind of rude to argue about only having to pay $10 more at a birthday party. This especially:

I parked between the fire hydrant's curb side yellow paint and the house's stairs. Seems innocent enough, but the catch is that I parked there for the 3-day 4th of July weekend. When I came back, I got this note on my windshield.
>  To [My-License Plate]

> It is NOT okay to park in front of my house and then take the Metro. Your car blocked my lawn, and it made it very difficult for me to mow it.

Here's why I parked there: I just moved to that area for a summer internship, and I was going back home for the 4th of July weekend. I put the bus station I was using on my GPS and it lead me there, but it only lead me to a pedestrian walkway to the bus station. The pedestrian walkway starts in a residential area and all parking spots around the residential area are for cars with permit only. I drove around until the parking spots didn't require a permit and I parked in the first spot I found (in front of the house above). Once I got to the bus station, I obviously noticed that there's a huge parking lot, but I didn't have time to go back to my car and move it to the parking lot so I just headed to my bus instead. 

What do y'all think? Am I the Asshole?","Yeah you're the asshole. I think you would have been fine if it was for like, an hour. But you were parked there for three days. Which is an extremely long time to be taking up space in front of someone else's house.

edit: added a word.

Plus I just noticed, he doesn't have a driveway. So that's basically the place where his car goes. I don't know much about areas like that and the legality of parking, but that basically seems like he could have been in the right to have you towed.

edit two: I would also like to point out that we aren't arguing the legality of what he did. Maybe it wasn't illegal, but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.

"AITA, I told my son (15) to jump another kid (13).. This kid has been bullying my youngest because he's a 6th grader and all of this dumb preteen bullshit. They always tell kids to tell their parents but they never really tell you, the parent, what to do. I called the school multiple times, my ex wife even threatened a law suit against them. They've still done really nothing, he's still in my son's chess class, still have the same P.E, still have the same lunch. Nothing.

I kept telling him to defend himself but he won't listen to me or he thinks of some cute but ineffective insults. I wouldn't care if he cussed him out at that point. The kid ended up threatening to put hands on him and he did, my son's arm ended up being broken. The school still did absolutely nothing. 

I was completely over it and honestly wanted to beat up that kid myself. But, I taught my older son some self defense techniques like holding a combination lock in your hand while you punch, avoid grabbing, how to take someone to the ground, the usual stuff. Since his friends were also there, I taught them too. Then, when I was picking up my son. After, he told me what the kid looked like. I told my oldest son and his friends to just get him. 

Now, my ex wife, is all pissy about it. She keeps saying that what I did was wrong and she's calling me a psychopath and all of these things. I know it's kinda morally wrong, but, is it really?

Note: didn't want this to follow me so I made a throwaway account. 

Update: I just wanted to tell everyone that my ex wife further explained what happened the day he broke his arm. They called her first and them being stupid, they didn't know if his arm was broken. She took him directly to hospital without the cops getting involved. Which is where I had to fill in because she had to leave. They were not aware his arm ended up being broken, I guess my son tried to explain that to me beforehand. But, I really don't think I remember so I probably wasn't listening. That part was a misunderstanding and very bad on my end. But, he still attacked my son and didn't stop to the point that he got severely hurt which shouldn't have happened because someone should have been there to stop it, they completely ignored everything that happened even though that day she notified the school that the arm was broken.

"AITA for calling someone out for not giving me a ride?. Hi all! A good friend of mine recently took a roadtrip to see his long distance girlfriend in a different city. Its about a four drive to a city that is widely considered a popular tourist destination. 

Me and a mutual friend offered to pay for gas and snacks for him to give us a ride as well (we said we leave on his schedule). AND we said we would uber to/from his final destination (his gf's house) to an airbnb by the beach, so as to not inconvenience him by forcing him to drop us off across town. Pretty good deal right? 

He declined it, and refused to give an actual reason as to why he didn't want to. Which seemed weird to me considering we were offering him a solution that would in no way inconvenience him, and eliminate his costs for the road trip. At the time I assumed that maybe he just wanted the solitude of the drive (which I was totally fine with), and forgot about it.

Two weeks pass and he is attempting to leave for the trip, when I get home from class to find a woman Ive never seen before waiting in his car. It turns out that he was giving that girl a ride to/from this city, AND he was going 25 mins out of his way to drop her off at her friends house. When I asked him what was going on he was visibly flustered, obviously embarrassed that I caught him with this girl, doing the exact thing he told his two best friends wouldn't work for him.

Am I right to be mad at him for doing this? Its one thing for him to want to drive alone, but to tell us he doesn't want the ""inconvenience and free trip"" only to give some side-chick a ride ON A TRIP TO SEE HIS GIRLFRIEND kind of rubs me the wrong way. 

Edit: For what it is worth I just found out they split gas. Which essentially means he paid to give this girl a ride, in my opinion solely motivated by a desire to cheat on his girlfriend for what would be the third time.","You're the asshole.  Things he doesn't owe you:

* A ride.
* A reason for saying no.
* An explanation about who he said yes to and why.

You're also an asshole for making assumptions about his character instead of giving *your best friend* the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps he just said yes to her before you asked.  Perhaps you're a shitty road trip partner and he doesn't want to be stuck in the car with you for eight hours.  Perhaps you have another annoying habits he doesn't want to point out to you, like time management issues or the tendency to go on and on about politics.

"AITA for canceling on a wedding in the middle of Dorian?. My (31M) gf (27F) and I were supposed to fly down to Florida tomorrow for her fathers wedding (the father is divorced from the GF’s mom). 

The father very kindly purchased plane tickets for us and a hotel stay for the long weekend. The GF and I just cancelled the flight that would leave tomorrow morning because we are scared of becoming stuck in Florida.

On one hand I think of course it was the right decision to cancel because it’s dumb to fly into a storm zone.

"WIBTA if I lie about a religious exemption on my school's immunization forms?. I'm currently enrolled in my first quarter of a grad school program. The school requires us to turn in immunization forms in order to sign up for classes in our upcoming second quarter. There are three required immunizations, and I tracked down my high school transcript to prove that I already have all of them. Unfortunately my school only accepts immunization forms from licensed healthcare professionals, so my high school transcript won't cut it.

I reached out to the primary care facility that my family went to growing up, but my old primary care physician is no longer with the practice and they don't have my records there. That means essentially the only way I can get documentation is to make a doctor's appointment, get a lab titer documenting immunity for the three (MMR, TDaP, and varicella), and submit that. The only problem is I have two weeks left to sign up for next quarter's classes, so it would need to be a quick turnaround. I'm not sure how long that usually takes.

My school has an exception that allows students to forgo the immunizations if they provide a statement of religious exemption. I'll admit that I should have gotten on this sooner, but it had honestly slipped my mind because I thought my high school transcript would be acceptable. The way I see it, submitting a statement of religious exemption would be significantly easier than trying to schedule an appointment and crossing my fingers that they turn around the lab results within the next two weeks. WIBTA if I lied about a religious exemption as a loophole to make sure I can sign up for classes on time?

Edit for clarification: I am pro-vaccine and in case it wasn't clear in my post, I'm 100% up to date on my immunizations. I graduated high school 6 years ago so even my 10-year boosters are current. This a question about sidestepping the clerical boundary, NOT about trying to sidestep the immunizations themselves.","YTA. It would be easier; it would also be fraud. And, if the school discovers later that you attempted to lie on a form like this, it could have grave academic consequences for you.

"AITA for ""writing"" on the driveway with my friend's power washer?. A few months ago, my friend came to my place to show off his new power washer. We cleaned some really dirty things with it and I decided it would be a good idea to write ""No Parking :)"" on my driveway with the power washer.

Recently, I moved out of that place and rented a room near my university (tired of driving so far away everyday, basically). My previous landlord contacted me, wanting reimbursement for ""defacing"" his property. I don't think I've defaced anything, but he said the writing can drive potential residents away. I explained that it was basically ""cleaning"", not ""defacing"" (because I used a power washer) and told him to just clean the whole driveway with a powerwasher. He still told me to fix it or reimburse him, but I can't because my friend sold his power washer already and I'm a broke student. I just told him no.

AITA?

Edit: I should add that I cleaned a bunch of other stuff the landlord failed to clean (fence, mucky outdoor tiles, outdoor furnitures, etc) and basically made them sprakling-new. I didn't have to do all that, but I just wanted to make my living space nice to live in. Can this balance it out, somehow? I know that from this post I'm TA, but I cleaned and maintained things the landlord doesn't give a shit about without anybody paying me, so I can say I did him a small favour.

"AITA For a customer overhearing a private conversation?. Throwaway from main account.

I work at a gym and we got a call from a customer saying he was charged a $45 fee after he cancelled his membership. Now I am not involved in billing but we get these calls a lot

I ask him ""did you cancel in person or on the phone?"" and he got snippy with me and told me ""I don't see why that's important, you can see I was charged after I cancelled."" We have a policy where if you come in and cancel in person, the cancellation fee is waived automatically, doing it on the phone includes the fee. 

I try to inquire more details and he mentioned how he moved to a different city and he couldn't come in person. I reiterated to him that unfortunately it was our policy and he said ""you guys are unprofessional, I tried contacting you guys last week and no one picked up"" and he went on to say how he thought it was a bullshit policy. 

I reminded him he should have read the TOS when he registered to be a member, as it does include the bit about cancelling in person to avoid the fee. He then threatened to badmouth our company on facebook. I was already getting annoyed with his tone and I offered to patch him to a billing supervisor to get it resolved.

So I connect to a supervisor while the customer was on hold, and the supervisor is a good friend of mine. To recall some of the conversation we had, I told my friend the situation but there were a few other unfortunate things I said:

""This fucking douchebag is complaining about something that happened awhile ago""

""He's a real fucking prick""

""He's some kind of crazy person, I'll patch the asshole through to you""

So after I transferred him, I go about my day and my friend calls me privately and told me I forgot to mute us and the customer heard the whole conversation and was screaming at him. Because the customer was rude, my friend was luckily enough able to hang up on him before the customer could escalate it to my boss. 

I suspect the customer will call back, my friend told me I was justified because the customer was rude and standoffish from the start, PLUS it was supposed to be a private conversation.",YTA and you'll be lucky if you keep your job.

"AITA by losing a friend who moved overseas?. TL;DR A friend of mine moving overseas fell in love with me, I made it seem like I was also into it, started dating someone else, and slowly stopped talking to my friend.

Long wall of text incoming

Last year, I (27M) moved to a large metropolitan area, knowing virtually no one there. I got a job working on a team of eight, including a girl that I'll call Laura. Laura is cute, not really my type, but we have a lot in common including an affinity for our hometown sports team. We spend a lot of time together going to happy hours with coworkers, playing board games, generally being friends- certainly nothing romantic. 

Fast forward five months and we start chatting a bit more often, frequently about more and more intimate things. Because we work together, we still deny any feelings starting to develop. The next month, she finds out she's moving overseas. She quits her job, but before she quits, I do some pretty sizable farewell gestures, including planning a going away party. At this point, it's clear we definitely have feelings for one another and, because she's no longer part of our org, we start making out and eventually hook up a couple times. Because she's going overseas for a few years, we have a long discussion that I shouldn't wait for her and that if we start to date other people, it's ok.

Laura moves overseas to a place where she knows absolutely no one. She helps me apply for her job, which I get. We text NONSTOP. We send each other dirty pics, talk often on the phone, tell each other we love one another. She meets a few local people but still doesn't have all that many people. Meanwhile I'm continuing to make friends in the city I live in, meet new people, generally continue on with my life.

In August, about five months from when she left, I met this girl (Nicole) that I fell absolutely head over heels for. Because I was interested in cultivating this new relationship, I started to spend more time with Nicole and less time talking to Laura. I don't want to upset Laura with the development of a new relationship, so I don't tell her about Nicole, especially if it doesn't work out. Laura seems to notice something's off, and asks me about it- I tell her everything is fine. We continue to chat, though at a lighter rate; I read her texts and don't respond right away like I used to. In my mind, it now feels like I'm in two relationships.

I decide to tell Laura that I'm seeing Nicole to help explain why I'm being so distant. I text her (probably the bad move) and tell her that I'm seeing someone and want to talk to her about it. She says ok, we can talk on the phone after I'm out of work. After I get out of work, I give Laura a call. Laura is furious at me, saying I destroyed her trust, ruined our friendship, that I'm a pussy for not telling her about Nicole sooner. She says she no longer wants to talk to me until I think about the situation and apologize. I say ok and hang up.

In about a week, I send Laura a long email apologizing for hiding my relationship from her and being so distant. We talk for a while and she agrees to start talking to me again under one condition: If I start getting distant again, she's going to stop talking to me for good. I say ok and hang up.

Fast forward a few weeks and we're still chatting a bit but this time I notice her getting a bit more distant. Short answers, curt responses, no longer continuing conversations. I figure she no longer wants to talk and stop talking. She doesn't resume conversation. That was the last time I talked to her- she's now blocked me on all social media, blocked my number, and told other friends of ours about the situation, essentially turning those friends against me. 

On one hand, I understand why she's mad at me- I basically continued a relationship with her after she moved and didn't address the issue when something else came up. On the other hand, she chose to move away, understood I wouldn't wait to be in a relationship with her longterm, and didn't bring it up further when it seemed like I was pulling away. So the real question is- am I an asshole or is this just an unfortunate circumstance in which I lose a good friend of mine? Any advice would be great here.","YTA, but you're not the worst person who ever lived.

She was moving far away and you both agreed that it was a short term thing.  That's fine.  But then you spend months (?) talking non-stop, sending dirty pictures, etc.  That behavior isn't really casual.

You can't have one ""It's not serious"" conversation and expect that to be bulletproof, your actions have to match your words.  Yours didn't.

"AITA for reporting my wife’s drug use?. Me: 32 M
Wife “Amy”: 30 F
Friend “Joe”: 28 M

I’ve been married to Amy for five years. She’s a wonderful woman and I love her dearly.

However, she’s always been more of a “free spirit” than me. Well, she says that, I say reckless. We have extremely opposing views on drug use. I am staunchly against all drugs  and I don’t even really like alcohol. Amy likes to go out, “have a good time” and drink occasionally. She smokes pot I’d say every other month maybe? And she does COKE like every few months as a one off on a night out. COCAINE.

Other than the drug abuse, she holds down a very high ranking position at work and has a PhD. She is very sweet, normally very responsible and I admit has her shit together which is why she’s so mad at me.

The other night was one of her “one off” nights where she and her close friend Joe bought coke. Since I hate it so much, Amy doesn’t do it in the house. She went to Joe’s; they did a few lines, then went out with other friends. I didn’t go because I hate going out. Joe keeps the coke at his place.

Amy and I have been having problems lately and I’ve been feeling neglected yes so I got pissed off, called the cops, and informed them Joe had drugs at his place.

Long story short he’s in a lot of trouble. Amy wasn’t implicated but she’s furious at me. Her argument is it’s like a twice per year indulgence (which is true) and she fees I’m controlling her. I say that doesn’t matter and I want it to stop. 

She’s also angry that Joe will very likely lose his career (they’re in the same field). By all accounts he’s a nice dude and very professional at work, he just likes to dabble. My argument is, so what? Drugs are drugs. Plus Amy’s getting too old for this stuff now anyway.

Sorry just want to clarify a few things: Amy uses her own money for the drugs / drink but I am worried that it’s taking too much time away from US if you know what I mean. She says I’m

"AITA for taking my niece to another state to look at the stars?. I know this sounds drastic but this was from Mass -> Vermont. Anyways I'm big into astronomy, I have an expensive telescope, can recognize a lot of stars by name, etc. However Massachusetts isn't particularly known for its dark skies and while it isn't Boston-levels of light pollution where I'm from, it's still hard to spot many stars. So every now and then I drive into Vermont with a friend & telescope.

  A few months ago I found out my niece became interested into astronomy and stargazing so I offered to let her see the planets through my telescope. She was ecstatic and ever since we've been stargazing together and I've been teaching her about the constellations. BTW just realized I didn't mention her age, she's 16 turning 17 in a month. 

 We can see some of the brighter constellations (think big dipper) but there's a lot more hidden due to light pollution. I told her about VT and she said she wanted to tag along with me and my friend. I agreed but wanted to ask her mother (my sister) however my niece said she wouldn't allow it. She begged me not to ask her and to just go & it would be our secret. I didn't think it was that big of a deal so I agreed. We went and had a had a great time.

I'm now wondering if I was too harsh... my other gf's and I joke around a lot, but Gabby never stood up for herself. She had introduced me to one of her new friends, Tiffany, who not only moved in with us, but I ended up becoming really close to, and the 2 of us kinda ganged up on Gabby. I resented the fact that Gabby's dad was a doctor and paid for everything of hers, and that she tiny with a perfect body (huge boobs though no butt), while I was flat and had an occasionally abusive dad.

Shit hit the fan a year later and Tiffany & I ended up having a huge falling out and stopped talking. So I ended up sending Gabby an email a year or 2 later sending a half assed apology, which she accepted, and told her she could have one of my pets who was more connected to Gabby than me, who I couldn't give attention/affection to. Gabby accepted and told me that I'd need to bring all of the cat's 

Anyway, we lost touch for YEARS after that but she found me on social media and added me, and I did the same. She looks good, happy, is traveling around the world a lot, doesn't look like she has kids or a husband. I just had a baby so I'm posting nonstop pics of her. Gabby just recently sent me a private message saying ""i'm so glad to see you're doing well...I remember back in the day you were pretty broken :( .. good to see youve picked yourself up. I'm sure having a baby girl softened you up- looks like youve come a long way from cruel andrea!""

doesnt that make HER passive aggressive and sounding like she's hung up in the past?What does she mean by that? Implying that she thinks I wasn't happy when we were in contact?

And do you think the stuff I said and did to her back in the day was at all bad? I feel like it was mostly college girl dumb behavior. thoughts?

tl;dr: An old friend (f/34) from college who I (f/34) bullied just recently added me to social media and commented on a pic of me saying ""so great to see youre doing well, i remember you were pretty broken/cruel, having a baby must have made you softer.!"" Is she implying that she doesn't think I was happy when we were in contact? I used to make comments about her body like telling her she had a 7 year old boys ass; asking when boys started noticing her and I'd try to stir shit by telling her people at bars were criticizing her looks. Was that horrible of me? We lived together when I did this but the whole time she was secretly condo-shopping and intended to leave me stranded to find a roomie without giving me notice.","You were an asshole then, for sure. If she's not participating in the back and forth, then it's just you shitting on her.

"AITA for suggesting our kids take my last name to my husband?. My husband is half Nigerian, half white. I kept my last name when we married which he was fine with.

"AITA for telling my sister she's going to be single for the rest of her life?. Now Im very anti bullying and into being compassionate, but! 

My sister is beginning to annoy the hell out of me. She perpetually complains about being single but does nothing to make any effort to meet guys.

She's not on social media, only goes to work and back home. On weekends she'll go to the movies with my parents or to the spa.

Since my wife and I live nearby we ask her to come chill with us and our friends (who she knows) on Fridays but she never ever does.

Last night there was a nice get together with lots of my single guy friends and I told her to come. She refused to because there was a woman who she has a disagreement with 5 years ago. Now I know this woman well, she's didn't give a rat's ass about my sister and will never try to avoid her because it's been so long and such a minor thing.

I'd understand if my sister had social anxiety or preferred online dating etc. But neither apply to her.

She's just very very lazy and hates putting effort into anything and/or changing up her routine.

My mom has two sisters who are very similar and they both are 45+ and still single.

I keep trying to break her out of her routine and meet ppl, yet she's too lazy to try.

Yesterday I got so annoyed I told her, this is why you're still single after all these years and you will probably be single for the rest of your life.

"AITA for not caring how my boots would look like?. First things first I don't speak English as my main language so expect grammatical errors and weirdly structured sentences.

So I had to go shopping with my parents and the main reason was to get me some winter boots because I didn't have any. I don't really care about looks and color so when mom asked me about how do you like these I just said ""I dunno"". I am generally like that but boy oh boy does she not like that type of behavior/attitude. We looked through a few rows and found some that actually fit well on my feet so they were perfect in size. I didn't really care for the looks so I just said ""these are okay"" and that we can buy them. She then asked me if I like them and I said I don't care about looks, they fit and that's all that matters. But she didn't want to have any of that and then dad joined her side and were kind of scolding me for not caring about looks. They asked me a final time if I like them and I again said ""I don't care, they fit and I don't mind the looks. They aren't anything beautiful but I honestly don't mind them"" they then proceeded to put them back and we didn't end up buying them and went home.

This happened yesterday and yeah this sounds petty but they always tell me I'm that weird kid and that I have to fit in with the other boys. She even went as far as to tell me to look at the boots others have so we can buy the exact ones. Like I'm 16 I think I can choose if I want to fit in or not. And every shopping experience pretty much goes the same way this one did but we always ended up buying something and this time we didn't.

I told her to just by the cheaper version of the color rush jersey, as long as it was the color rush jersey. She interpreted that to mean to buy any jersey, which she did.

"AITA for telling my bf's friends a potentially embarrassing story?. This happened a while ago and me and this is actually my ex boyfriend but i think about this incedent a lot and can't get an unbiased opinion from any of my friends or family. 

About 2 years ago when we were both 20 he wanted to go to a party with some of his friends on the campus of the college they went too. I wasn't a huge fan of the idea for multiple reasons but the main one being he was underage and it was a dry campus. I knew there was going to be alcohol there and I tried to tell him that of they get roudy in a dorm room the campus police will be called and it would be potentially bad. I didn't have an issue with him drinking but I suggested they come over to our apartment instead where I felt it was safer. He didn't listen and went anyway. 

Well surprise surprise they got too loud and campus police showed up and I had to go pick him up after he was given a citation for underage drinking and I was pretty pissed. While on our way home he wouldn't say sorry too me but called his mother sobbing to tell her and say he was sorry. He was super drunk and I thought it was a pretty funny reaction given everything else. He woke up the next day and I made him tell me what happened and it included a story of his friend throwing up all over a police officer which he laughed about and told everyone we talked to, even joked about the incident to her face. I thought that was a sign that the embarrassing stuff they did that night was worth joking about and when his best friend asked me what happened after I picked him up I told her about how my bf called his mom. 

My bf was furious at me for ""emasculating"" him and embarrassing him in front of his friends and yelled at me about it then and everytime is was brought up after that until the end of our relationship. I know I probably shouldn't have said anything but if you're going to make fun of a girl to her face about puking on a cop on the same night I guess I thought he should be able to take a little himself?

We live pretty far (10 hour car ride, $300/ticket flight) and I don’t think my kids (7, 10, 15) need to attend. That would also mean my wife would have to stay home. Flying wouldn’t break us and we’ve done the drive many times.

"AITA for not bringing my girlfriend to explore a cold war era bunker. This happened tonight so I'm still trying to figure things out. To give some quick backstory during high school me and my friends used to go and explore abandoned places looking for adventure. That was all 2 years ago though and recently I've lead a pretty boring life aside from dating this girl, lets call her M. Me and M have been dating for almost 9 months now. And she's generally a bit more introverted than me and she didn't do any crazy exploring stuff ever unlike me and my friends.

Tonight I got a text and a call from one of my friends saying that they found a way into a place that we've always wanted to get into. An abandoned cold war era bomb shelter or at least what we thought might lead into one and he wanted me to come with him and a couple other guys to check it out. I was already on a phone call with M so I let her know and asked her if she was ok with me going because she doesn't like me doing stuff that she thinks might be dangerous. She surprisingly seemed ok with me going but it seemed like she wanted to come as well which made me a bit more apprehensive than I already was because if this was actually the bunker it could have been potentially very dangerous and M has no experience dealing with potentially life threatening situations like that and is easily overwhelmed so I start telling her this and she got upset. After this I almost was convinced to bring her and told her that if she really wanted to I would but after telling my friend he said that it would be too dangerous to bring her so i told M that I didn't feel safe bringing her and I felt like it was too dangerous.

"AITA for being livid at my roommate for calling me an ambulance?. So Thursday, I went to a party one of my friends threw. It was your pretty standard college party and I got pretty drunk yada yada. When I went back to my house, I was stumbling around trying to get to my room. One of my housemates helped me to my room and told me to sleep it off which I planned to do. 


I don’t remember too much since I blacked out but this is what some of my housemates told me. My roommate was in the room when I came in and he said I kept falling off the bed and talking to myself. He ended up calling an ambulance for me and apparently the EMTs forced me to go to the hospital and threatened to call the police if I didn’t go so I didn’t have a choice. 

When I woke up in the hospital the next morning, the nurse gave me papers to sign and then let me leave. They also stuck me with a $1000 hospital bill for the ambulance. Since I was basically dragged to the hospital, I left my keys and phone inside so I couldn’t get in. None of my housemates were home so I ended up just waiting outside of the house for like an hour before one of them finally came back. On top of that, I missed my CAD class which is a whole different story. 

I was absolutely pissed with my roommate for calling me an ambulance. Not only did I end up spending the night at some hospital, I got a $1000 bill on top of it too. It’s one thing if I had alcohol poisoning or something like that but I literally just slept at the hospital and left the next morning. The housemate who helped me inside was on my side, he said I was hammered but it wasn’t that bad and I could just sleep it off. The roommate said he got scared and didn’t know they would take me to the hospital but that just made me even more mad since there was like 5 other people in the house at the time and his first reaction was to call the police rather than ask the others. So AITA?

Edit: I’m not mad at my roommate for calling the ambulance. If I looked that ducked up, I would probably do the same. I’m upset about the fact that calling the cops was his first instinct rather than ask the other roommates. I mentioned my other housemate said I was super drunk but I could sleep it off and my roommate instantly decided to call the cops. I didn’t get any tests at the hospital, I literally just slept there for the night and left when I woke up.

"AITA for continuing to misgender my sibling. Throwaway for reasons. Using my sibling's preferred gender in this post. I usually don't.

Long and complex relationship with this older sibling. Not going to go into all of it but it needs a little background. She did a lot of stuff when we were young. It fucked me up a little. Suffice to say her exes have said she was emotionally abusive to them and that fits in with my experience.

She is the oldest child and the first grandchild on both sides of our family. I would call her spoiled but that brings the wrong images. What she had was all the attention she could ever want. I do feel bad for her for this. Most of her life seems to be trying to recapture having this amount of attention.

She has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse. She would disappear for years at a time. When she reappeared she was always in need of money and would claim she was a changed person. This would last long enough that we'd believe her.

I was in college when she had one of these ""changes."" I knew better than to believe her but she was family. I made the mistake of asking college friends about this. They told me I was TA and I needed to forgive her. This time she remained in contact with the family for a few years.

It was a year or two after I got out of college that a long time family friend came out as Trans. This friend lost a lot of friends and a lot of family and our whole family was invested in supporting her. A week or two after this my sibling called me. She told me she was Trans. I instinctively believed she was only doing this for attention. But I was struggling to learn about Trans and just didn't know what to do. So I did the only thing that felt right. I told her I loved her and accepted her no matter what gender she identified as. Then, from my experience with the family friend, I realized how difficult it would be to instantly refer to her by her proper pronouns having known her for 20+ years at that point. I told her this and asked for a little grace as I struggled to do this. She agreed.

Next Saturday was my birthday. I'd already invited all my siblings and cousins to play an online video game with me to celebrate. She came but she had purchased an airhorn. Everytime someone misgendered her she blew the airhorn into her mic. I was pretty pissed.

Some point soon after that she went no contact with the family again. I decided after that to not bother trying to change my way of speaking about her.

She has just recently got back in contact with some of the family. When speaking about her I am still misgendering her and using her old name. Other family members have called me TA for this. I'll probably change my language around them. Outside the family and to others who like me think she is only Trans for attention I fully plan on continuing to misgender her.

I, Male 21, had been on my own for the past year, but due to some situations with living will be moving back in to my parents home in the next week. There I will not be charged for rent or for food, but will still be required to pay off car insurance/gas, my phone bill, and any other necessities that I need while there. I am not Mormon any more, and have not been for the past 2+ years. I know that by moving in they will try to get me to go to church with them and try to bring me back, but I wont be doing that (it hasn't been strictly stated that me going to church with them is a rule for my habitation there, but I feel like it will be pushed on to me). So for the WIBTA part. I have wanted a tattoo for the longest time now, but due to it being a permanent change to my body, I have been very selective in what designs I would want. I finally decided on something that I love, and it wouldnt be that much, maybe $200 after tip and everything. This particular tattoo would be impossible to hide, and I know how irritated my parents would be with me if I were to get one.

"WIBTA if I said something about how long my friend takes to say goodbye to his girlfriend of one month?. Title sounds a bit biased, but hear me out. I am a senior in high school and we go out about 4 times a week. Recently, two people from our group have found love. I have no problem with this, and am happy for them, however there’s an issue. I do not have my license, due to some issues currently being worked out, so my friend is my ride when we go out. I am very thankful for this, and express it. 

When it comes time to go home, my driver stands outside his truck while I sit inside for nearly an hour while they hug, talk, and just generally get all lovey-dovey.

"AITA for getting mad about my sister cancelling our concert plans?. My sister (23yo) lives 3 hours away from me (32yo) and the rest of our family. A month ago my mom contacted me and told my sister isn't doing well mentally, and that she feels depressed, lonely and isolated. I learned that she's taking medication and seeing a therapist about it. Since I have a history with depression and therapy as well as a teenager I decided to give my sister a call during which we decided to book a rock concert together in combination with a weekend out. The same day I bought all the tickets and made all reservations.

Today I received a text message from my sister saying that she discussed our weekend out with her therapist and she'd like to cancel our plans. Her therapist advised her against it because she feels that visiting a rock concert isn't helping her mental recovery. My sister said she's very sorry about cancelling our plans and asked me to return the money. I got angry and replied her by asking if her therapist got her license with a pack of cornflakes and called the advise BS referring to my own experiences as a teenager. I made a sarcastic comment that staying at home, alone is such a great alternative, after which the conversation quickly escalated. I decided to cut it off and tell her she doesn't have to pay back the money and just leave it at that. 

I discussed the incident later with my wife and she asked me how I could do just a thing.

"AITA for always sitting in the window seat?. Like most, I hate the middle seat. I travel a lot for work and will always pay extra for a window if I have to. I'm kind of tall, feel trapped in the middle. The usual. I do anything to get the window.

My wife just wants to be with me. It's cute and I like it even though we rarely talk once in the air. She prefers not being in the middle, but it doesn't bother her that much as she's short, leans on my shoulder to sleep sometimes, and her top priority is to always sit with me. It works out great when there are only two seats on one side and she can be aisle, but she sits middle every other time.

She started making snide comments recently about how it ""might be nice to have a window"" occasionally, so I booked her in the window for our flight today right in front of me. She got happy when she had 10F today (window) and then disappointed when she realized I was sitting in 11F, not 10E (middle).

"AITA for suggesting I may be mentally ill to my girlfriend?. In the past month, I (25F) have made an effort to educate myself on mental disorders, because I think I have undiagnosed mental illness. I grew up in an Asian immigrant culture where mental health issues were never prioritized, even stigmatized, and never openly spoken about. I do plan to seek professional help when I start my new job, and can utilize health insurance coverage in a couple months.

Recently, I read about the different types of bipolar disorder and watched videos of people filming their manic episodes. I noticed some similarities in my own behavior and the cycles of manic and depressive episodes that are included in the DSM diagnosis criteria. 

My partner (31F) of 7+ months called me after I woke up from a nap today. I was in a very energetic and elevated state. I was talking quickly about various topics running through my mind and I felt like I was in a giddy/good/heightened mood. Halfway through, I realized that I might be experiencing the mania that I've recently read about. I told my girlfriend about what I've learned about bipolar disorder and how I think my behaviors comport with the cycles that people with the disorder experience. 

Her immediate response was to tell me about how recently her coworker's relationship ended largely due to her coworker's partner not being able to access her bipolar disorder medication. I became upset and told her that her initial reaction seems like she is more worried about breaking up, than about me, which deters me from sharing more information with her. She said ""I'm sorry, I'm not perfect.""

I have never been this open with past partners, or even friends, about mental issues. This is the longest relationship that I have been in. I think I expected more support from her.

"WIBTA if I moved my family to another state?. Sorry for formatting, on mobile. Also sorry that this is crazy long. 

Some background: I have a husband and 12 year old son. My husband is the step father, we have been together 3.5 years.   

My son and I were living in California when I met my husband. After a year, we were engaged and he was offered a job in Indiana. We decided since I was working full time and trying to go to school full time, that I would quit my job and we would move across the country. This way I could focus on school and then get a job. 

Moving to Indiana meant moving my son away from his father, who we can call P. P was never consistent, spent a lot of money on drinking and weed, and never ever ever paid child support. For the last several years before we moved, I wouldn't even tell my kid when P was coming to pick him up because many times he didn't show up. So, we weren't exactly moving away from father of the year. Side comment: I did set it up with the courts that the child support he was supposed to be paying could be put into a travel fund to fly the kid back and forth. This is enough for him to fly out twice per month via Southwest. Aside from the three times my husband paid for the kid to go out there, his father has never flown him out. We haven't heard from P in a year and a half now. 

My kid took the first move really hard. He was in fifth grade, had lost his grandma (my mom) a year and a half prior, and now had lost his dad, for all intents and purposes. He actually failed a class which was not like my kid at all... And he started making some friends that were bad influences. I always give kids a chance because you never know what kind of situation they have at home, but when they prove that they don't want to live a better life I figure I can't help them. 

Anyways, After I graduated, I got a great job paying about $120K per year, and was accepted into a top MBA program in Chicago (I travel to Chicago once per week for classes). This job required that we move about 50 miles away. I stayed at this job for just over a year, but the culture and environment was so unhealthy I actually started to suffer depression (no prior experience with depression). I started to let go of things I cared about, my grades were slipping, and I found myself not really smiling from being happy but smiling from force of habit/appropriateness. 

Anyways, things got really bad for me and my husband and I decided I would quit my job and focus on acquiring a small business (which has always been our dream). 

The kid adjusted much better to the second move. He has all A's and two B's at school. He is an avid hockey player and is at the rink practicing 5-6 days a week. He even has a pretty little girlfriend. He's adamant that he never wants to move again. 

Fast forward to 3 months later. The business deal fell through and we're super disappointed about it. We've spent thousands getting prepared to take over this business in our city but unfortunately it didn't work out. 

Current situation: my husband is currently a VP. He makes good money but we lost a lot of income when I quit my job. 

He's been looking for a new position for a couple of reasons. Things are getting really rough at his current place of employment. They were just bought out and all the higher level executives are at each other's throats and stabbing each other in the back, because they know the new owners won't keep all of them. This makes his day to day life more stressful. 

Also, he wants to be able to supplement some of the income I was making/would have been making with the business venture. This will also help me start a new business of making fine wood crafts and custom furniture. 

This week he's staying up in Michigan, about four hours from here, interviewing for a President position. He's one of two candidates and I have no doubt he'll get an offer (he's amazing!)

I have really no attachment to where we're living aside from a little part time job I have, horseback riding lessons and Irish dance lessons. I'm sure I can find those things up in Michigan too though. 

My concern is for my son though. I'm so worried about moving him again. I'm not worried that he won't adjust again, I think he will. He has such big dreams and he wants to get a scholarship to pay hockey for Notre Dame. I'm sure all of that will continue. I'm just so conflicted about sending him through the emotional trauma of moving again. 

We discussed my husband moving to Michigan and coming home on weekends, so that my son and I would stay here But, my son has made so many exceptional improvements since having a male role model in his life, that I feel losing that will do more harm that moving again. We're a family and need to stay together. 

If this all goes through, my kid and I would stay where we are until the end of the school year and then move in the summer. My husband would move immediately. 

So Reddit, WIBTA if I moved my kid a third time in three years? ","YTA 

It's all fine and dandy for you guys to up and move all the time, but that kind of constant moving around can be rough on kids.  Especially in three years??  He's finally happy, has a girlfriend, has good grades, and you guys want to take that way from him again?  Not to rain on your parade, but it sounds like your new plan is almost identical to your old plan, which obviously didn't work out, and your son is going to see that as well.  

Finances can be rough and all, but you guys should seriously start looking at job options in the area.  At least until your son graduates from high school.  Other than making more money, it honestly doesn't sound like you've been considering him much at all these past three years.  I wouldn't be so sure your son is going to be as well off if you guys move again either, in terms of academics.  Switching high schools also means switching curriculum, which can either mean he's not going to be challenged enough or (worse) he'll have so much catching up to do he's going to fall behind. 

Also he's plenty old that I think he deserves to have some say in this conversation as well.  At the very least he should be able to voice his opinions.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for not voting for my girlfriend as student council president?. Note: This all happened well over a month ago, I’m only posting about it now because my friend suggested the sub to me.

My school is a very small one (only about 150 kids, total), and because of that, student council elections can become pretty heated. When campaigning first started two weeks before elections, there were two sets of President and VP running. I was in full support of my friend, let’s call her Rose, and the girl she was running with for VP and President respectively. My support of Rose had nothing to do with my friendship with her, and I tried my very best to make that clear. I was in support of Rose because she had clear goals and solid plans to get to them.

However, two or three days before elections came around, my GF came up to me and told me that she had decided to run for President with her friend as VP. After reading over her goals, which weren’t bad at all, but weren’t fully developed and weren’t what I thought the most vital changes the school needed, I decided to stick with my initial vote. That night, my GF asked me if I was voting for her, and when I said I wasn’t she was clearly upset, which lead to an argument (it was nothing major, we rarely fight enough for it to seriously impact the relationship).

The tension was only made worse over the following days when people began to tell my GF they were voting for her because she was dating me, which was bad all around because a, that made her feel like it was a popularity contest, which everyone agreed wasn’t what we wanted, and b, I felt bad because I didn’t want to tell people not to vote for my GF, but I also didn’t want to take away votes from Rose.

When elections finally passed, neither Rose nor my GF ended up being voted into office, and I can’t help
but feel guilty over both neither of them being elected. I believe I’m partially at fault for both campaigns failing because I didn’t show enough support for my GF, but I was still taking away votes from Rose just by being with my GF. My GF and I have talked things through since, she understands my side and we’re now better than ever; but looking back I still feel guilty and like I inadvertently doomed both campaigns.

"AITA for telling my sister to grow up?. I am 28M and my sister is 25F.  We did NOT get along as kids. She was the typical annoying little sister and I was the mean older brother.  I teased her a lot growing up, but I did my best to make sure that if I did tease her or if we did have a fight that I said sorry or made her feel like I didn't mean any of it.  I never wanted her to go to bed thinking we were not on good terms.

She moved out when I was 22 and she was 19, I went to her farewell party and I really thought we were good, I never apologized for what I did but I was proud of her for going to college.   We stayed in contact about once a month just saying how our lives are going, We weren't close but we weren't pushing it and I enjoyed seeing her tell me whats going on in her life.    She came back for thanksgiving when I was 23 and she was 20, and it went well.  I saw her in person like one more time at christmas when I was 25 and she was 22.  I didn't go to any family holidays on my side for like 3 years since I got really serious with my SO (we got engaged 2 months ago).  and I went to her families place for those holidays since we lived closer.

Yesterday was my dad's birthday and I haven't seen him in person for a few years so I spent quite a bit of money to have me and my SO fly down to their house and stay the week.  My sister was there too, I was happy to see her in person again and have her meet my SO.  The whole party was fine and I know my parents were happy that both their kids were together in their house again.  At night when my parents went to bed.  I was having a drink with my sister, when my SO was going to the store for breakfast material.  The subject of our past years somehow came up, I told her I feel bad and I'm sorry for any troubles I gave her during that time. I could tell she was kinda miffed and idk if it was the alcohol talking but she basically said that once our parents die, she doesn't want much to do with me cause how much of an ass I was when we were kids.  I was SHOCKED when she said that, because I thought we both moved on from that and thought we had a loving/caring (yet distant) relationship.  I didn't even know what to say, I was/am heart broken because I do love her and always wanted us to at least be caring towards each other but she basically said she has no desire to do much with me kinda hurt.  I finally got it out and said ""what we did as kids was YEARS ago and if your still on about that then you just need to grow up, I'm sorry how I treated you but it shouldn't be the basis of why you hate me now.""  

She didn't say anything after that but ""you done?"" and then went to bed. The next day she talked to me like nothing happened, I was weirded out by that but didn't want to make a scene in front of our parents who still have the view of us being close.

"AITA for letting a girl come onto me despite telling them it was not a good idea because they are km a relationship?. Well...more like 3...and one was engaged. Ill start in chronological order.

So the first one was a few years ago
 We started doing work and studying together. She was in a rocky relationship since highschool. She wasnt happy was only really with him because she had insecurities. I told her that if she was unhappy then she should break up. Let me iterate this, if this was a friend, or someone I had no interest in, I would have told them the same thing. It just so happened that i liked this girl as well. 

The next one was a couple of summers ago. I got a job at a doctors office and there was this girl working there who was a few years older than me and was engaged. Eventually we started talking and then she started coming onto me. I kept telling her, that it wasnt a good idea and that she was engaged. From what she told me, they had a very similar friend group and a lot of people kinda pushed them together. She kinda felt like it was what she had to do. She said she wasnt happy with him and he was lazy, inconsiderate, etc. She still kept pursuing me and eventually I'm like screw it, I'm game. Eventually they broke off the engagement amd we did out thing.

This next one was with a German exchange student about 5 years older than me and in a 5 year relationship.  Shes older than me, EASILY a 9/10, athletic, and an amateur model. But as fate would have it she was in a 5 year relationship with a dude. Apparently the dude she was with was always working, since he owned a small business, was never home, and cheated on her a couple times, but she stuck with him.

To preface this story, I am 15, and will be turning 16 in two days. I chronically forget to do things for the birthdays of my family, which I do realize is a jerk move on my behalf, and something I am working on fixing, though it is not the focus here. My mom decided, since I didn't do anything for her birthday, she would do nothing for mine. She also said she would allow mw to do anything I planned myself

Though I was upset, I figured it was fair enough, I have a job, I could do my own thing. I worked with my friends, who ended up planning a surprise party for me, as well as I scheduled things I wanted to do, namely attending a global food exhibition in my town, as well as going to dinner with my grandparents and dad(my parents are divorced). None of these plans involve my mom, which I thought was fair, since she said she didn't want to do anything, so I made it so she wouldn't be involved.

That was kind of hostile and uncalled for, so I said ""And perhaps I should have taken care of your grandpa, so that nuissance could've died sooner, and hadn't outlived his usefulness"". He got incredibly mad at me, and he told me that a dog and a family member don't have the same value. I told him to suck it up, since he started it all, but then he just left without saying a word.

AITA?","> ""And perhaps I should have taken care of your grandpa, so that nuissance could've died sooner, and hadn't outlived his usefulness"" 

WTF that is way worse than what he said. Not because it is a human vs. a dog, but because you are being so insulting about his grandpa. What a nasty thing to say.

"WIBTA if I told a guy's girlfriend that the reason they broke up for a year was because he tried to cheat on her/fell in love with his current housemate (my girlfriend) and only came back because he got rejected?. Basically when I met my girlfriend she had this best friend who was literally attached to her hip. It was pretty much a relationship without sex - He'd even ask to do stuff like sleep on the floor in her room because he was 'lonely'. They had known each other for a year but both been in relationships up until about a month prior to me meeting her, when my girlfriend broke up with her ex. He was in a 4 year relationship.

One night they're out for drinks together and he tries to kiss her, she pulls away. He tells her they have an undeniable chemistry and that he'll break up with his girlfriend so they can be together. She tells him she doesn't like him in that way. He breaks up with his girlfriend, tries again, and fails again. Apparently he was gobsmacked that my girlfriend didn't feel the same way.

At this point, a bunch of stuff happens including him skipping uni exams to spend time with her and him 'accidentally' taking ecstasy pills instead of flu tablets in an attempt to stop my girlfriend going to my house. Me and my girlfriend were rocky over these months and he was always her shoulder to cry on, he would tell her how the relationship is clearly not going to work and we sound toxic for each other. As this is going on his ex is messaging him and he's ignoring her.

Things stabilized for us. At this point he asks ""So you guys are proper serious now?"", we say ""yes"".

By some massive coincidence, the two of them stop being such good friends, he starts being cold with her and trying to make other friends. I do feel bad for her over this, because it can't be nice for your ""best friend"" to do this to you. 

He and my girlfriend met up for the first time in about 2 months (they've not been living together as it's been summer break). He told her that him and his ex are finally back together. And that he's not told her about anything that he's done, anything at all.

I couldn't believe it, I feel so sorry for this girl. It shouldn't be his choice that it's ok to live with a girl he was and most likely still is in love with. He's literally living with the girl he tried to cheat on his girlfriend with, the girl he says he's never had a better connection with and the girl he broke up with his girlfriend to try and be with. And she has no idea.

In my opinion his girlfriend gets to choose if what he's done is okay, whether he deserves a second chance and whether she's comfortable with him living with the girl he threw away their 4 year relationship over.

My girlfriend agrees that the guy's a complete prick, but that I need to keep out of it and that she'll be really angry/upset if i say anything, because it could completely fuck up her living situation for the next year.

So, WIBTA if I told his girlfriend about his 'history' with my girlfriend?","NTA I was leaning ESH because you mentioned things have stabilized with your girlfriend and if you do something she asked you explicitly not to then it is disregarding her feelings on the matter and likely to cause an issue with you two.

"AITA I had a hand in breaking a couple up. So some back story. A couple years ago a couple approached me to be their unicorn. For those of you not in the Swinger/BDSM community all that means is I was their girlfriend. 
We would get drunk and have threesomes but we would also go out to the movies and go get drinks. It was a very food relationship. When the husband was out of town I would go out with the wife and she was constantly spending money. 
She didn't work and has never had a job. Legally they aren't married either but they have a child together. 
She was constantly shopping, getting her nails done, and also she was allowed to play around with other men when the husband was out of town (with his permission). 
Well she never cleaned. They house was always a fucking wreck, her car was a mess, and even her kid was always dirty. This shit drove me crazy because she was home all day, everyday! I don't know how she could live like that. 
She also would not let the husband go out unless he hand a budget on spending, mind you he made all the money and never gave her a budget.  He also had curfews for when he went out drinking with friends 
So a couple weeks ago we got really drunk together and the wife was our with some boy toy and I told him exactly what I thought of her. I told him he deserved someone who took care of him especially if he was taking care of them. I told him no person who worked 16 hours a day should come home to a dirty house when their spouse didn't work. I also told him I would be much better. 
Well yestwrday he kicked her ass out, although he is still going to be paying her rent and gave her a car.

So essentially we had just eaten and I was putting C to sleep in the bedroom. The other two were in the other bedroom watching a movie and I happened to fall asleep while rocking C. A took advantage of this by sneaking into the living room and playing the Xbox set up there with B. (by sneaking I mean closing the door to the room I was in and turning the volume on the TV all the way down.)

B’s father comes home and didn’t have a key for some reason (It’s his house) so he rang the bell and the two kids opened the door. B’s father yells at me and really digs deep to make me feel awful. He says how anyone could have been at the door and I held back tears. 

B’s father says he’s no longer letting me babysit  his daughter and isn’t paying me for this week. I feel awful and take blame but it’s not entirely me at fault. Who doesn’t have a key to their home? Who doesn’t ingrain the concept of stranger danger to their kids?

"AITA for correcting my sister for trying to rewrite history for sympathy and validation?. My sister got involved with a guy who was no winner. But to be honest, neither was she. After the ""honeymoon"" phase of their relationship ended and he started cheating on her, she became pregnant. There is no doubt that this was on purpose because a baby always fixes things, right?
The guy tried to stay with her, but it was not happily ever after enough for her so she left him and took their baby with her. She fought tooth and nail to keep him away from his son. All of a sudden he was some kind of monster. Was he a loser? Yes. A monster? No. Keeping his son away was her bizarre way of punishing him for not making her happy. 
They went to court and the dude got a raw deal. Basically became an every other weekend dad and even then my sister made it hard for him. It became such a toxic situation that he just stayed away and became the birthday card dad. He married and has kids of his own and seems to be a really good dad.
My nephew is now 9 and my sister plays up the single mom victim card every chance she gets. Her narrative is that her boyfriend ""got"" her pregnant and ""basically"" abandoned her and made no effort to be a part of his son's life. It's a role that I see a lot of single moms with the same story play up. 
Well she went on on social media about how hard it is to raise a ""fatherless"" boy and how awful it feels to be abandoned but she's doing just fine. She compared herself to widows who lost their beloved husbands to cancer or war. Then pictures of her and her son smiling. Uh, no you're not. Your son has issues. He's been emasculated. He gets picked on at school because he's too sensitive. He's never had a dad teach him about being rough and tumble. He's not even a Mama's boy. He has emotional issues. 
So I corrected her on social media. I told her that my nephew's father was an ass but she's not that much better. She was the one who did not want him in the picture and she got what she wanted. It's been almost 10 years and she needed to grow up. Her son's father is the one who's solidly married and coaching his kids sports teams and your the one with two kids by two different dads (the other baby daddy is a crazy war vet... another story).

"AITA for being direct with my Mom?. So, I was sitting in one of the rooms in my house where I play videogames with my friends. I was playing a game that my friends couldn't play unless I was online and in the game. I was home alone for most of the day until my Mom came back from going to my grandma's house, and as usual, she immediately told me to turn my PS4 off. Now, this happens often and it's really infuriating when she does it because I can't leave my friends so suddenly. So I often try to reason with her on why she would want me to turn it off. Problem is she always just repeats to turn it off or says she's my Mom and has higher authority to me. So this time I ask her why and she says the usual, so I get mad and directly said ""I always get a (certain word that means being anxious but also mad at the same time and is mildly rude) when you come home, and I'm saying this in an honest way, because I don't wanna lie or run around the point"" now, she sometimes tells me to come over to the living room and talk to her and have ""fun"" and often she just asks me for favors (which I don't mind) but straight up ignores me when I talk. So I started ignoring her when she  said to come over, and I acknowledge that in our conversation by saying ""you always say that I waste my time but what do you want me to do? Talking to you proved worthless because you only ask me favors and just ignore what I'm saying. So what should I do?"" She replies with nothing. So I continue with "" your lack of a response proves that there is NOTHING I can do, which is why I prefer to entertain myself with videogames"" now you might disagree and say there is plenty to do other than videogames. But let me tell you that I live in an area that is dry with average 50c temps, so going out is a no-no. And she doesn't want me out of the house at night. So I don't have much to entertain myself with. But I want to have fun with my friends and videogames are the best possible way to do so. Anyway, after what I said I looked at her and her eyes were teary and she started saying ""was it all for nothing?"" And ""I would preferred to die than hear you say that"" she then grabbed a tissue and left the room. I immediately told my friends that i HAD to leave and turned off my PS4.

"AITA For making out with a girl which I was interrested in but was drunk.. So long story,

I've known this girl from a good friend, and at some point I started being very interrested in her. At that point we were pretty good friends. Then came the birthday of my good friend and me and the girl were flirting the whole evening, of course we both had already drank a lot so maybe the alcohol should be mentioned. Later that evening after a lot of flirting when we said goodbye we started making out. Next Day comes and we just discussed it and kind of just stopped it there. We both were ok with the situation and no one of us regretted that evening so far. 

&#x200B;

Month later and its the birthday of the girl.

There are like 14 people and everyone is already pretty drunk and the evening so far is pretty funny. I still had interest in her but she started dating someone else and on that evening she flirted with some other guy. I didn't really care since I had other things in mind and I just didn't want to destroy the evening for myself. Later me and my good friend,best friend of the girl, go for a little walk (5-10 minutes), and she tells me that the girl told her that she wanted to make out with me again, so me who is interested in her goes like ""Yeah, I'm down."" I have to mention that i'm pretty drunk at this point and when I look back now i'm kind of ashamed but me and my good friend walk back and she went in before me. As soon as I walk in my best friend told the girl something and the girl just comes out and we started making out for like 5 minutes straight until her brother started looking for her but I think he didn't see anything. Anyway next day we went to a ""Fasnachtsumzug"" (i really dont know how to explain it in english, look it up you will immeaditely get it. And there she sees her ""date"" making out with another girl so she was pretty devastated at first. On that evening i text her and ask why she so devastated since she has made out with 2 guys the evening before. The didn't remember making out with me because of the alcohol and i explain her what happened and again we just remained there. But a day later she texts me asking what the fuck is wrong with me and stuff like that and accuses me of using her to make out only because she was so drunk which I really didn't know since at the point where we made out I didn't see her for like 40 minutes and couldn't have known. Now she makes it look like I knew that she was drunk and I was too irresponsible to check on her before she literally ran me over to make out with me and flirted with me on the same evening two hours before. I actually apoligized that I should have been more responsible and stuff like that but she just spitted on that. And in between the 2 evenings we talked a lot and were pretty good friends.

"AITA for telling my ex-husband to find a different job so he can see his kids. Whoa. Deep breath, this might be long-winded. I’m new at this and don’t want to leave anything relevant out!

Ex (36M) and I (37F) went through a pretty contentious divorce about 4 years ago. We have two tiny humans together (under 10yo). I have sole custody, he has super liberal visitation, but has chosen to see the kids only about 15 days total in 4 years. He is in a job that pays about 80% of our combined income (there’s a huge discrepancy between his field and mine), he receives about 60 days of leave a year, and lives around 6 hours away.  I am currently in school, getting a second degree (allllllmost done), because one tiny human has significant special needs and being the one that cares for the kiddos 365 days a year, I couldn’t maintain my first career (little to no sick leave, inflexible schedule,etc.).

He’s currently taking me to court to seek a reduction in child support because I am in a different state (state A) than where our divorce occurred (state B), and they have much different guidelines, he would owe half the amount he pays in state B, and at this point none of the child support reflects his $40,000 a year increase in pay . During mediation, he basically said that he can’t have a relationship with the kids because I have them too far away (5 hours), and that his job requires him to travel at a moments notice, etc., and that it’s not fair that he’s being seen as a paycheck, and that the amount he currently pays isn’t fair. He’s blaming me for being too far away and that this is all my fault, basically.

More info: Our oldest kiddos care providers have stressed that inconsistency is terribly damaging to him psychologically, and causes meltdowns and aggression, which means that when ex just randomly shows up or calls once every few months, it sends kiddo into 3-4days of emotional turmoil/behavior, which I’ve shared with my Ex, as well as asking him to try to be consistent in visitation, trying to explain that he can’t just pop in and out every few months and expect the kids to have a relationship with him.

I told him that he can’t keep his current position if he wants to have a relationship with his kids and repair damage that’s been done (he stated that he feels like damage is done and he can’t fix it). He’s pissed that I told him that it’s his choice to keep a job that affects his ability to be a real father to his kids. 

AITA asshole for calling him out for choosing his job over his children, and telling him that it’s his decision to do so that has basically killed his relationship with his kids?

ETA: I did not intentionally move 6 hours away with the kids. He is military, and at the time the marriage imploded I went home (we had Just moved to the state and new next To no one) to give us some space from each other, and since I was the primary caregiver the kids went with me. I didn’t even want a divorce initially, he said he wanted a 6 month separation, and within a few days of me going home he essentially ghosted me for 4 months, broke our lease, and moved and didn’t tell me where he went. During this time, I attempted to establish a temporary custody arrangement per my lawyers advice (she said it was typical) and he refused. Our divorce decree actually states that we share the driving, so I have in the past driven halfway for the few visits he has had. 

Oh, and I mentioned the income, because the child support modification is what started this whole conversation. If i had to choose between money and him having a relationship with the kids, hands down, I’d choose the kids every single time.","ESH. He feels like nothing but a paycheck.

For the record, I don't have any problem reading and commenting on her stuff, the problem we are having is HOW she wants me to do it.

&#x200B;

She wants me to get up from my desk, and sit at her computer to read her stuff. Personally I find this arrangement super annoying because she could just send it to me via email and let me read it at my desk. If she sent it to me it would be less disruptive to my work flow, not to mention I have a larger more accommodating screen (because I am not on a laptop), and I am often already comfortable in my chair. It is also hard for me to change gears from math, to English, and then  jump back into math (or programming).

I asked why she can't just send it to me and she said ""It's only two paragraphs, why can't you just come read it?"". I explained that I would rather read it at my computer. She said I was just being stubborn and didn't understand why I wouldn't help her. I told her that I was perfectly willing to read her stuff, but felt that if she wanted my help it seemed reasonable to at least let me help her on my terms. She stated that forcing her to email the stuff to me was ""getting everything my way"", to which I replied ""isn't that exactly what forcing me to sit at your desk is? It is you asking for my help and only accepting it if I do it under your exact instructions. I don't see why I have to disrupt all of my stuff and relocate just so you can get some feedback, to me that expectation is far more selfish than asking that you just email me what you have."" She said ""if you want to read it at your desk so badly why don't you come over and send it to yourself.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This went on for a bit and she kept returning to ""you don't have a good reason not to come to my desk,"" and I kept saying ""I don't think you have a very good reason to not just email me your paper, even if it is 2 paragraphs. If you want my help meet me half way!"" She threw he hands up and said ""fine I guess you just won't help me and I will fail the class."" I thought this was childish, and said ""if you are going to act like this about it then,  I guess I won't help you anymore unless your attitude changes.""

Edit: since it would not let me post more than 3000 characters, I had to whittle it down a bit. Basically this is not the first time we have had this conversation. She insists that the only way for me to help her is to sit at her desk to do it. Also worth noting is that on the occasions when I do sit at her desk to read, she gets up to do something else to kill time until I'm done reading.


Second edit: there are lots of comments suggesting google docs or a network folder. To her these are the same as emailing so they are probably out of the question even if they are good ideas. Additionally, this is not an issue of me being lazy and unwilling to move, I do that frequently. That stance is, at very least, an over simplification of what is happening.

"Aita for firing my assistant on the spot?. So I play in a decent sized band, at least big enough to have guitar techs and drum techs. It's a very bass-oriented sound, so I put huge value on my sound, being both the bassist and a singer.

We recently hired this little dude as my bass tech. His job is simple, make sure the bass sounds good, works good and is setup my way.

We were just having a pretty big set for us, and he blew it. He got me flatwounds (basically ultra slippery, high tension strings that cost 20 bucks more), not conducive at all to my sort of playing.

Then he tuned the basses to E, we tune E flat, so I was out of tune for the first song. I had to tune it myself on stage, which is unprofessional as fuck.

Then I turned on my distortion, it was flat and dead. The fucker had left the old,crusty batteries in.

He starts going off saying ""no, that's bullshit... that's what I was told and agreed-upon... so now you have to eat it and give it to me for that much."" 

I explained to him that I can't give it for that little  and I'll be willing to compromise for this misunderstanding and give him a 20% discount as a floor model and give it to him for $800 instead. He didn't even speak to me directly and starts claiming me as a ""snake"" because that's not what he heard and I'm going back on my word as a business owner and ""a man"". I told him that I could easily say that he's a snake back for trying to take advantage of me while I was asleep.

This goes on back and forth for like a good 40 minutes and, mind you, we haven't run a single card and we haven't touched a dime of his. But to him, we already owe him this table for not a penny more than $300. No takesy backsies. It finally escalates to me just ignoring the issue with the table all together and asking them what color does he want the other items he ordered in. He said he doesn't want to buy anything at all anymore. So I said ""Great we're done here then"" and just deleted the invoice altogether. Now the dude asked me if I want to talk to him outside. 

I said ""What we got to talk about? I've been taking to you for past 45 minutes."" 
""No, c'mon, I just want to talk to you.""
""Why we gotta go outside for that?"" 
""I can talk to you behind that counter if you want."" 
""Really, with all these cameras are around us?"" 
""Yeah I don't care."" 
""Yeah man, I don't want to talk to you man."" 
""Yeah, I bet you don't...."" And he walks out and waits there by his car for me to get out. 

But it's a good thing he did though. The second I saw that door close, I called 911. I let them know that a customer threatened to assault me because of a misunderstanding over a price. About 10 minutes later while the guy was still outside, three cops showed up and started questioning him. They came in and questioned me, I told him what went down, and they told me if the guy comes back, I can call them up and they'll take him away. They're right down the street. He eventually left after he saw the cops weren't leaving. We locked up and I was walking to my car to get home safely

I told this to a few members of my family and friends and they told me one of two things: 
° ""This wouldn't have happened if you weren't sleeping on the job like a bum. Clearly, he was way more wrong, but you weren't right.""
° ""Next time you get a situation, or deal with a person like that, just give him what he wants and get him the fuck out of your face.""

I take full responsibility for sleeping on the job. It's just wild to me that the day ended up so ""Murphy's Law"". It's the first nap I've taken in maybe 10 months and the one person it would have fuck me over with just happened to be the one I got.  But I got it disagree with giving him what he wanted. To me, that validates his behavior and lets him know that he can pretty much do that whenever he wants in my shop again. Or others for that matter. And not just for him, but maybe for his buddies too.

Sorry this post went on longer than expected, but what's your guys take on it? Am I the asshole for not living up to those two bullet points?","ESH he has no right to threaten you or do anything thats just silly. But he didnt try to ""take advantage of you while you were sleeping"". Your employee asked you how much for the table and you told her the price. He didnt do anything. And if you were the consumer in the situation you would be upset as well if you were told one price and then when you go to pay for it they suddenly say its 700 more. Surely you can see why he might have been upset. But eh. You live you learn.",1,0,1,0,0
"AITA for slapping my friend?. So I went out to the park the other day with my friends. At one point we needed to go to the toilet so me and friend A go to this weird toilet building the park had (not a port-a-potty, an actual structure with stalls). Thing about this building is it was absolutely vile with like a super sharp smell and the white tiles on the floor had brown mud (and maybe other stuff) stains all over from people walking around all day. I'm currently in crutches because my leg is broken so I was stepping on that mess with my crutches.

Later, we were sitting around next to a basketball court and friend B was messing around with the crutches, when she pointed one at friend C's face. It was at arm's length, and C reached out her arm and grabbed the end of that crutch and just held it for a second. I told her it had been on the dirty toilet floor and to take her hand off of them, and she turned her face to me, smiled her fucking annoying smile, and right after I tried to give her some friendly advice proceeded to WIPE HER HAND ALL OVER MY FACE. It wasn't wet or anything but it had still been on the goddamn crutch. So I got angry and I slapped her on the top of her head. It wasn't even that hard. It couldn't have been painful. And then the 2 friends sitting next to us were sooo shocked at me. Honestly they should take a bus right down to Satan's butthole. If I could have done it again I would have done it harder and directly on her face. I honestly don't think I'm the asshole here. Do you guys?","You’re both assholes.

"AITA for asking if she was hiding something from me?. A little backround:
I[25] was seeing this girl[22] about two years ago, we werent in a relationship per se, but things were getting kind of serious, from my part anyway, then she started acting wierd and i found out she was sleeping with someone else at the same time. I was crushed.

Started seeing her about 4 months ago again, she really seemed to have grown a lot and was in a good place in life. I gave her another chance. This time we were in a comitted relationship.

Now to the event:
We were supposed to have a double date the day after christmas, but she declined in the last second because she was feeling terrible, had a night of anxiety (she has a lot of anxiety, ptsd and she abused a lot of drugs when we last saw eachother wich btw i thought was over).
Then she stopped answering mid sentence, this was in the middle of the day. After a few hours I decided to go to her place, i was worried. I can hear her music in there but shes not opening the door. I knock harder and harder and now im super worried. Finally she opens the door with the safety chain on, pupils big as her eyes. Im asking how she is and if i can come in for a minute to talk.. Just a cold ""no"", i ask whynot.. ""no"".. 

I just blurted out ""someones in there right?""
She closes the door without an answer.
She is saying i triggered her ptsd with my knocking, and that i only came to her place because im controlling and that i thought she was cheating. I was worried. Thats all. 
Next day she breaks it up because of the above reasons. Making me feel like a total shitbag of a human being, saying im full of shit. Doesnt even try to see my POV. So am I the asshole?

"AITA for pointing out to my obese aunt that her day hike to the Hollywood sign wasn’t that big of an achievement?. Hello AITA...

Backstory: I have an aunt who is only 6 years older than me so in many ways we were raised like brother or sister or cousins. She and I have never gotten along, like ever. So in the last few years she gone form fat to massively obese. She won’t be weighed but she could be 350lbs and I wouldn’t be surprised. She is also on this massive kick that she’s as hot as any other girl, she’s super healthy and she can do anything that everyone else can and she’s fat and proud. That would be awesome if it were true but she lives like a fucking hoarder, she watches thousands of hours of Netflix and rarely leaves her room and always bust my parents data cap and pays no rent. 

So like last weekend miraculously she and her friends did the hike up Mt Lee (to the Hollywood sign in LA). Awesome, I’m glad she did it and I think she wouldn’t be such a miserable person if she got out more. Honestly.

But we were at a family dinner last night and she was just bragging up a storm about how amazing the hike was and how she’s so experienced now and she was giving people advice on hiking. Mostly I was ignoring her but then my mom said “hey you know lib235sgh is training to do the half Ironman in Colorado this year!” 

My absolute idiot aunt just launched into me how “ohhhh that’s nice but you aren’t really don’t aerovic work like I do unless you’re going up hill!” I told her I was like yeah but I just ran 10 miles right before dinner. She again said that “you realize that doesn’t REALLY count right?” 

I lost my shit. I told her she went on a day hike that at worst  should take 3 hours and it took she abd her pig friends all day. In fact they didn’t even make it down until after dark. That doing a hike and getting passed by grandmas and toddlers isn’t really something to write hone about. She accused me of fat shaming. I told her to call it whatever she wants. She stormed off to her room.

Everyone thinks I should apologize but I just hate her condenscing attitude towards everything I do. I went to go into the Navy seals next year and fitness as beeb a huge part of my life. For her to talk down to me because she’s done one hike...EVER...caused me to lose it.

"WIBTA if I insist that my boyfriend's house is redone in certain ways?. My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years, lived together for over a year. We're both in our 30s.

We laugh at my joke that we should never go to ikea together, but at the same time, it's probably true.

I want to repaint the walls new colors, rearrange rooms, etc. They are the same color as when he bought the house well over 5 years ago. He could probably live his whole life happily never changing anything. There are things he agrees with me about, such as the color of the cupboards. But then there are things he doesn't want to change. I was scrubbing the bathroom today and realized that not only are the cupboards the ugly color of the kitchen (he agrees), but the bathroom, bedroom and kitchen contain different shades of the same blue and brown. I'd like to repaint it all. He's not pleased with my revelation.

Onto the location of the bed. My reasoning to move it is that it's right against the kitchen wall where roommates use the *loud* microwave. Also, all the upstairs plumbing runs through that wall, including *loud* showers, toilet flushes, etc. His reasoning not to move it is that it takes a lot of work. Which was pretty much his reasoning for not painting walls.

Onto the bedroom dresser. I want something aesthetic, a touch more feminine, and an in-between of us both. I don't want to disregard him completely. I always hated when I saw that happen in relationships on television: the male being disregarded completely. But right now there is a hunk of metal on the dresser, almost 1.5 feet by 1.5 feet. It's a coin door for one of his arcade games. He has three arcade games in the living room. (Getting him to agree on simply *rearranging* the living room took over a year; it was like pulling teeth, and it hasn't happened yet. I'll never ask him to put them in the basement or in another room, though. He loves them and I love that about him.) I suggested today that we put it on a shelf by his games because it would go with that aesthetic, and we could soften up the bedroom. He didn't respond, which maybe suggests that it's possible: he usually gives a reason why we shouldn't.

TL;DR: I don't want to change everything about my boyfriend's house. But I've realized that it's my home too, and I'd like it to make it *feel* like home to me without overwhelming my boyfriend and taking away his identity.","ESH hes dismissing your ideas and youre being demanding. just because you dont like it doesnt mean he doesnt like it either.

"AITA for refusing my brother's invitation to Christmas at his house?. For context, my husband and I have 4 kids together. His mother passed away, but even before that we did not have much interaction with his family. 

My mother passed away 8 years ago. I don't interact much with my sisters (one took off to Florida years ago after abandoning 3 of her children and is in and out of prison and the other is not a nice person.) My oldest sibling and only brother, we'll call him J, is my only close family. He raised me along with two of his own children. I love him and his wife, L, rediculously.

Now here's the issue: his wife's family has always taken precedence in his eyes. When I was younger and living with them I was always included but not made to *feel* included. Christmas meant watching L and J's kids get tons of presents from their aunts and uncles (L is one of 6, and then their extended family too). L and J always got me something, so no big deal and I was a teenager anyway so it didn't really matter.

Then I had my own kids. My brother and I grew apart. I stopped doing birthday parties for my kids because other than J and L, we had no family to invite. They never wanted to come to my house for holiday dinners because L's mom (and now L) does the dinner thing. Eventually they stopped buying presents for my kids even though we still brought stuff for theirs. Invites to their functions became more and more belated until they stopped altogether.


A couple days ago I shared a meme on Facebook about family sticking together and all of a sudden I get a message from J about how we should come over for Christmas dinner. I politely declined and he pushed for a reason why. So I told him that not only do we have our own dinner planned and traditions that we observe, I didn't feel comfortable making my children go through another year of watching their cousins open piles of gifts from L's family while mine sit there with nothing. He was angry and blocked me after telling me that I was ungrateful for everything he and L had done for me.

 I understand that Christmas isn't about the presents and my children should be grateful to spend time with family, but here's the thing. They only ever get presents from me and their dad. We're not rich, so they don't really get a lot to begin with, but they are extremely grateful for what they do recieve. 

I'm just tired of watching my kids feel hurt because their cousins have more family than they do, basically.

Am I the asshole?

**Edit:** For clarity, my brother and his wife raised me. Her family is very closeknit, and I've been involved with them since I moved in with my brother at 12yo. I'm 35 now. 

What I'm really upset about, I guess, is realizing that me and my kids aren't really as much a part of that family as I had always been told.

It is the feeling that while these ""family members"" were out picking out gifts for people they love, no one thought of my kids. There are other things that contribute to this, not least of which is that my brother didn't bother to even message my kids on their birthdays this year.","ESH.

"AITA for airing my ex's dirty laundry on social media?. This is something that's been bothering me quite a bit.

I dated a girl for 6 months (we'll call her D), things were going well despite some fights, and I was mostly happy. She eventually left me about a month ago. I respected her decision, told her I'd help her get everything out of my house when she's ready. I will admit. I wasn't the best partner at times. I suffer from PTSD, bipolar, had dealt with a death in the family, and the death of my best friend - so during the last half of my relationship I was suffering and withdrawn while trying to balance full time uni and work. I think it's fair that I admit this up front as I'm not going to pretend I'm the easiest person to love, but I still did a reasonable amount of cleaning in the house, regularly cooked for her and her friends, and paid almost all of her bills while she lived with me. I tried asking her regularly what she was up to and keeping an open line of communication (we both study psychology, I'm partway through my undergrad, she's partway through her grad work so we're both **generally** pretty good at communicating - or so I thought).

Anyway, I moved on, I had some hook ups, and I am now seeing someone else.

Yesterday, I received a message from one of D's friends who had also become my own mutual friend letting me know they had something they had to tell me that they felt awful about. It seemed unusual, but I was open to hearing what she wanted to tell me. She then let me know the entire relationship D had been cheating on me with someone else. Showed me conversations confirming the cheating, but then dropped a real bombshell

D had herpes and had known about it the entire time we were dating. She never told me about this. She never told me about her seeing partners behind my back (obviously), and now I had to go back and tell every hookup including my new permanent partner that I may have contracted an STD. As of today I got test results confirming I did NOT contract it (Luckily the chance of contracting as a guy if the girl is not having an outbreak is pretty low), but here's where I was potentially an asshole..

I posted a full explanation of what happened on social media in public view. I called out D and advised anyone who had slept with her behind my back or had slept with her in the past to get tested. I revealed everything about the infidelity and even her family can see it.

D then responded by making a status calling me a liar and saying I was being fed false information - so I then posted ALL of the text logs that our mutual friend had sent me revealing everything she had been doing which she was not aware I possessed. I've been told by other girls that what I did was extremely petty and wrong and that I should of just let it go. I feel awful about doing this and feel like I'm in the wrong. But I think people should know what she's doing. The next guys might not be as lucky as I was.","I think it's disingenuous of you to say you did it as a warning to future guys, unless you think all her future guys will be checking out your old social media posts.

"AITA for 'tricking' my friends into thinking I couldn't feel anything for about 3 years. So for a bit of background, in middle school (8th grade) bloody knuckles got really popular in my school with all the boy, its just a game where you take turns punching the other person's fist until one person gives up. We did it at lunch all the time and it became a joke in my group that I couldn't feel anything because I would never back out, I do have a really high pain tolerance so it wasn't really that bad for me. 

So fast forward to highschool and even though we don't do bloody knuckles anymore it's still a joke with some of my friends that I can't feel anything. Well soon I had made a bunch of new friends and they found out that I 'couldn't feel', when they asked me I was all like ""oh yea totally, try punching me in the arm"" so one of them did, it was a really really light punch, and I didn't even react so from then on I was known as someone that couldn't feel. This lasted until my senior year when I was my girlfriend's house for a new years party and was helping her cook some deep fried mushrooms when my thumb got blasted with hot oil and man that hurt like heck.

"AITA for wanting to focus on my school before getting married?. I met my current girlfriend of 4 years while we were in grad school. We were both very physically active but were passionate about teaching. After a year of dating, we both graduated and wanted to get our Phd's. She was accepted into a very good program while I wasn’t but took a fantastic job in a different area. During that 6 month process, I felt empty and lonely while she was extremely reluctant for me to move closer. We still wrote each other letters, I would have flowers delivered to her office and we still stayed together. I felt that I was the glue holding things together while feeling confused by her reluctance. I was able to secure a work form home position with a stellar internal team at my job, so with her blessing, I packed my things and moved.

Over the next 6 months, I noticed there was still reluctance on her end. Her PDA limit on campus was zero ( it's the work place, understandable ) but the tentativeness of me being around always odd to me. Her department secretary would melt in her chair when I'd swing by asking when my gf would be out of the office so I could plant a surprise on her desk. That spring, I wanted to bring her flowers for valentines. I knew where she was teaching that day so I wanted to put the flowers in the room she would be teaching in; girls like getting flowers but girls LOVE getting flowers in front of other people. I asked a few students around if they were going to her class. One student agreed. That night, she blew a gasket and told me to never do that again. She said that I crossed the line, interacting with her students and giving her flowers while she was teaching. I was very, very confused.

That spring, I was also accepted into my own grad program at the same school. The next two years was me being tossed around by a poorly ran department while she was getting ready to graduate. I ended up being kicked out of my program for not passing their exams. Fortunately, I moved to another department.

At this point, our relationship did a complete 180. I had started focusing on my school to help give her the space but she had since started demanding less space. She has secured a job about 1.5 hours away and wants to get a place together in between our schools ( 45 minute commute for each of us ), plan our wedding ( not engaged yet ) and expresses that she's getting ""old to have kids"" on a weekly basis. Part of me thinks I should be ecstatic since this is the reciprocation I had been desiring in the past while another part of me thinks that I should focus on my PhD and that I deserve that time & space I gave her. Whenever I bring up the past, pointing out that I gave her that space in the past and that I actually would appreciate being able to finish my degree without having to plan a wedding, travel 45 minutes every day and think about having kids; that is always met with some sort of ""it was different back then"".

"AITA for calling my mom toxic and manipulative?. I (F25) live at home (working, responsible) with my parents.

We have family visiting from out of country. This is a hassle at my house because my mom is weird about visitors (friends never came over casually because she had to make sure it was clean, we never answer the doorbell) 

Was discussing with my parents plans to see our family. We live an hour outside a city where they will be flying in. We all have different schedules so coordinating has been a challenge. 

Visiting couple booked a hotel in the city. Dad wanted to have them at home but mom kept saying that they prob want to see the city, we didn’t need to host. I agreed being that we don’t live in a destination town. However, in 2016 WE visited THEM and they picked us up from the airport, took us around the city, etc.

Mon is weird about dad’s family. She talks badly about them and has been a bottleneck for seeing them (we are closer to her side) however, whenever people come over my mom does the bulk of the work-cooking, cleaning, hosting so I can understand her not wanting that burden. 

Mom said that we didn’t need to pick them up from the airport. She said we went on vacation a few months ago and did it ourselves (taxi, train) but I said there’s an obligation, and THEY picked US up from the airport. She said “what are you talking about?” I repeated, “there’s an expectation when there’s family.” She said “you are totally missing the point” and we argued back and forth over this.

This escalated to the point of mutual yelling. At one point she grabbed my wrists and slightly pushed me back-I immediately pulled away and said “don’t touch me” (this has happened 1x before, nothing hurts, but I don’t like it esp coupled with the anger). Eventually I said “FINE you don’t want to hear me because my opinion isn’t valid, I’ll leave” and went to my room.

20 min later she came to my room and said “don't come near me, don’t hug me. don’t you DARE speak to me like that again, saying ‘don’t touch me’” (we are an affectionate family normally, but when she’s mad it’s awful) I didn’t apologize so she kept at it. Finally I said “this type of behavior is dangerous, it’s toxic and manipulative” and she looked at me in a shocked, disgusted manner. She said “toxic and manipulative...I will make you regret those words” and walked away.

I waited about 30 min and then went to her room to say goodnight (I never sleep without doing that, you never know what can happen). I knocked on her door to hear her lock it. I asked if she had just locked the door, she said “yes, what do you want?” “I just wanted to say goodnight” she said “there’s no need” I said “you know that no one expects you to always be right,” received silence back and went to bed.

"AITA for playing my guitar at a campfire of people I didn't know?. I am currently on a solo road trip across the country to just experience life. So far everyone I've met has been generally really cool and I've made some friends I plan on seeing again. 

I am currently at Grand Tetons and spent a lot of time out on the lake yesterday. When I got back it was pretty chilly so I saw some people about my age (early 20s) having a campfire. I got a sixer of my absolute gnarliest IPA and my guitar and walked over to say hello and hopefully make some friends. 

Everyone was cool at first and I handed out all six of my beers and got a Bud in return. I was cool with that since they were being cool. I just started lightly strumming my guitar as I was chatting with this really cool girl. She asked me if I knew ""3 little birds"" by Bob Marley so I started playing it. 

All of the sudden this dude just started making fun of me. I don't know exactly what he said but it was like ""we're all friends from Indiana University and this douche thinks he can play guitar over our conversation"" (again not exact but I know he mentioned IU  and called me a douche). The girl I was talking to said don't worry about him and asked me to keep playing so I kept playing. The guy got up and got literally in my face and said that if I didn't take my guitar and get the fuck out so he could talk with his girl friend he was going to shove it up my ass, then burn it then throw it in the lake. This time even the girl didn't stick up for me and I said that it was really lame to take my beer and not be cool. He said IPA is shit for hippies and burn outs from Oregon (good call for a dumb ass, he nailed that) and that it made me smell like shit. I got up and left and the entire group was laughing at me as I left, even the girl who asked me to play the song. I was camped a few spots over from them and I could hear them partying for a long time but they were gone before I woke up this morning. 

It was such and unnerving experience, was I the asshole there? I don't want to make that same mistake again.

edit: using a throwaway since I've shared an outline of my intermarry on my main account.","ESH. The guy was a douche about it and over reacted, no argument there. But seriously, if she wanted you to play and other people there already made it clear that they didn’t want to listen to it, just go somewhere else. I like live music and all of that stuff but sometimes when you’re hanging out with friends and drinking and talking, you don’t want some random guy you don’t know to just whip out and start playing a guitar. 

Just randomly breaking out a guitar around a bunch of people you don’t know and starting to play unprompted and without asking if it’s okay is just kind of obnoxious to begin with, to not stop when people there have made it clear they aren’t interested just makes it worse. If she was the *only* one sticking up for you, it stands to reason that most of the people there didn’t want you playing, either. 

A good rule of thumb is that unless the people you’re with ask you to play, they probably don’t want you to. Especially if they don’t even know you.

AITA My wife’s company had her open a “company credit card” that is in her name.. Wife has a company credit card the owners “opened for her” that had her name and credit line attached so she could buy company items that the bill went to owners house.  I found out today and was irate.  She thinks I’m over reacting because they pay the bill. Everything shows up on her credit report alone.  The credit limit and amount owed.   I can’t believe she is so universally stupid,I was with you being upset until you called your wife stupid. Maybe talk to her and help her understand rather than be an asshat?,1,0,1,0,0
"WIBTAH if I ask my neighbor to keep his dogs inside when we are outside?. TLDR: neighbors loud barking dogs keep us from enjoying our backyard. 

Two years ago new neighbors moved into the house next door. Prior to moving in, they fenced in their backyard. Turns out they have two small dogs (cairn terrier sized) that they let out into the back yard a LOT. These dogs bark like crazy at anyone in the back yard and they don’t stop. I am rarely out in the back yard more than ten minutes before the dogs make an appearance. The very loud barking is very unpleasant. It’s difficult to hold a conversation with anyone. The neighbors do eventually come and get the dogs and take them inside- often after twenty or thirty minutes. But within an hour the dogs will be back and loud. 

The dogs substantially interfere with our ability to enjoy our backyard. I know dogs have to use the bathroom, but the neighbors do have leads for the dogs in the front of the house. 


An important note: 
I believe the dogs are well taken care of: they look healthy and are never left out during bad weather.",ESH.  I believe that unfortunately you WBTAH here.  its an unfortunate situation but it is their yard so you cannot have any say in how long their dogs are in the yard or how much noise they can or cannot make.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend off for not helping with our expenses?. On mobile, apologies for any formatting errors. 

I own a condo, but I still pay a sizable HOA fee, plus standard utility bills, etc. My girlfriend moved in with me this past April from another city, and since she didn’t have a job immediately or savings, I took care of all our bills. After about a month, she found a good job that pays very similarly to mine, along with added benefits like health insurance.

However, in that time, she has not begun to contribute to our bills at all, leaving me to pay everything, including food and vet bills for both her dog and our second adopted dog. She claims to never have any money, and in fairness to her, it’s not like she’s hiding her money from me; she’s just very poor at budgeting her money and prioritizing financial needs, something she herself admits. I’ve dropped hints and directly asked her to “help however she can” several times and explained the toll having no health insurance or ability to save is taking on me, but I’m still the one footing everything, despite her and I making similar money and having similar individual expenses every month. 

My girlfriend and I were just having a heated argument, and when I realized it was going nowhere and just getting needlessly ugly, I went in the bathroom to take a shower and relax. I shut the door fairly emphatically, after which I heard a loud crash and opened the door to see what was wrong. My girlfriend was standing there, having slammed the bedroom door and said: “see, I can f***ing slam things too.” I replied: “you don’t pay for **** around here, so no, you can’t.” 

Her demeanor immediately changed from angry to crying, she said “you can’t come back from something like that,” and she got dressed to leave. I told her I didn’t mean it be vindictive or to hurt her, but that I felt very unappreciated and the frustration was boiling over and that I was sorry it came out that way. Nonetheless, I don’t think I was wrong in saying it, even if it wasn’t the greatest timing. 

Am I the asshole? Thank you in advance for your perspective.","From your story it sounds like you haven't had a real sit down to discuss finances. Without that you can't expect her to get hints especially since you've let her get this far with no contributions.

"AITA for faking orgasm with my BF?. Ok this is a throwaway account because I'm a Redditor and dont want this post in my normal account history.

To start off, I am one of those women who cant orgasm vaginally, I can only orgasm through clitoral stimulation and this has caused issues between my boyfriend of almost 2yrs and I. When we first got together and he found out I cant orgasm vaginally he started bragging about how many orgasms other women have had through him vaginally(immature I know...we are both in our late 30s so that was an ew moment for me). He's referred to me as an alien, abnormal, and being broken sexually. We've tried toys and whatnot to get me to cum vaginally but it just doesnt work so he usually just goes down on me to get me off.

I don't need to get off everytime we have sex and Ive told him I dont expect him to get me off everytime, most of the time Im perfectly satisfied with just a good pounding, but it really bothers him to the point of he gets irritated at me that I cant cum through intercourse and then I feel like there's some thing wrong with me. This has turned sex into something somewhat stressful and makes it take longer than normal for me to cum when he goes down on me because the whole time Im feeling self conscious. I feel like if I cant get to orgasm quickly then I've failed at sex and making him happy.

3 weeks ago I started taking anti depressants, and a side effect is inability to orgasm or taking much longer to get there than normal. I told him this but he's getting even more irritated now because he wants me to cum within minutes when he goes down. 

The last two times he went down on me it felt great as usual but I just didnt feel any of the usual build up to climax and I knew if I told him I didnt think I was going to cum because of the meds he would say something assholish about me being broken again, so I decided to fake it both times. He was happy that he ""made me cum"" and asked for the usual accolades and I avoided the awkwardness and irritation from him afterwards. I feel bad about being deceptive, Ive never had this be a problem in any of my previous relationships and have never faked an orgasm before. AITA?

TL;DR faked two orgasms because boyfriend gets irritated when I cant cum quickly.

","ESH.  Your boyfriend doesn't seem to understand women's anatomy and you're doing yourself a disservice by teaching him that what he's doing is working.  What he's doing isn't working and you're depriving yourself of a good time by validating his behavior.

"AITA if I disallow my son to go to church at all until he's older?. I recently left the church I have been a member of my whole life. My wife is still a member and attends every week. I intentionally didn't mention what sect, because I want you to judge objectively, not based on your personal religious preferences.

My wife wants to take him, and I want to disallow it.

I have 2 primary reasons why I think I'm justified in this:

1. I want him to be free to choose what he believes or doesn't believe about religion. I feel that young children by default believe what adults tell them, so by being subjected to adults and authority figures all passionately teaching the church doctrine as fact, childrens' right to choose for themselves whether to believe is stolen from them.
2. Teaching that if you disobey god's commandments, you will go to hell for eternity and are unworthy to be in god's presence is a form of psychological abuse, IMHO. I have had massive psychological damage and low self-worth my entire life because of this, and am only now breaking away from it.

My wife and I both agree that we will respect his decision when he's older, but I feel like if he is ""forced"" to believe before he can defend himself, that a lot of the damage will have been done. Once he's old enough to think for himself, (12?) of course I will allow him to go.

She's also on board with letting him not go if he's LGBTQ+, but again, by the time he would know that, the damage will have been done.

Obviously both of us should have an equal say in how the child is raised, but I feel like my method of not teaching him anything about religion and her method of having a large community of adults actively trying to indoctrinate him are apples and oranges.

Letting him go every other week is an option I suppose, but I think that that's still ample opportunity for brainwashing. I could actively teach him not to believe but I would feel like an asshole about that, and it goes against my philosophy of letting him decide for himself. I will definitely teach him as much as I can about science and critical thinking, and to ask thoughtful, logical questions about what he is learning at church.

Update: well, guys, you have convinced me that IATA because 1. I am the one who changed after my wife married me with certain expectations for our son, and 2. A divided and resentful marriage is almost certainly more harmful than religious exposure. Let the brainwashing commence! (every other week)","ESH.

"WIBTA for PM-ing a co-workers and asking them to wear a mask or cover their mouth?. Alright. So. It's flu/cold/sick season. I work in an office with a bunch of small cubicles. Lots of people have been getting sick here. Enough that corporate has put up tons of signs about hygiene and stuff, and staying home when sick, along with boxes of doctor face masks for people to wear if they are sick. 

There's quite a few people around me that have insisted on coming in despite being sick, and aren't even attempting to cover their mouths or noses while coughing and sneezing and stuff. I have to walk past them a lot in order to do my job, which means I'm around them when they sneeze and cough and such.

"AITA for asking our roommate to move out?. I live in a house with 3 girls, let’s call them Sally, Kathy and Mathilda. Sally has been in the house the longest- nearly 3 years now. She is the only one on the lease but I am signing up for it soon. 
Kathy has been there a year and Mathilda 3/4 months. 
Unfortunately since Mathilda moved in, there has been tension. She is a lovely girl most of the time but can get quite defensive when ever we have to bring something up and likes to deflect blame. For example we have a house chat and someone might write “hey girls, can we make sure we’re all taking the bins out”. And she will reply “it wasn’t me, I’ve been eating out every night”. Which is fair enough but a) the rest of us all accept that maybe we’re not pulling out weight and should make more of an effort, without deflecting and b) she might not have been home to eat but she’s still been at home throwing things in the bin...

She is also quite OCD and wants everything spotless. Which is hard in our big house with us all having jobs and lives and also, Sally and I aren’t particularly tidy. I’ll admit it, we try but our standards aren’t as high as the other girls sometimes. That being said, we don’t think Mathilda has been totally pulling her weight either. She’s also more of a party person and even though she hasn’t had a big thing in ages, she has friends round nearly every night. They stay in her room but Sally has very sensitive hearing and it keeps her awake at night. This has been brought up before but still it’s too noisy. 
Kathy has decided to move out to her friends house and has confessed it’s in part due to the messiness. I totally accept that and we are parting on good terms. 
Now Kathy is moving, Sally and I have been chatting and don’t think we want Mathilda to stay. The dynamic is all wrong, there’s a lot of tension in the house and we think that finding someone new to replace Kathy will be hard because Mathilda will want someone so completely opposite to what Sally and I are looking for. 

So today we sat down and told Mathilda we didn’t think it was working out. We explained our reasons and told her we do genuinely like her as a person (we do!) but she’s not a right fit for the house. She was really upset and angry at us, telling us we are so rude and that once we agreed she should move in, that’s basically a contract and unfair of us to change our minds. That once you have a shared house, you have to just put up with whoever is there. 

We told her she could have as much time as she needs to find someplace new (turns out there is a lot on her plate this time of year- which we didn’t know!) and we apologised and admitted that we know how hard it must be for her. She’s furious at us and I feel like a horrible person. AITA?","I think ESH. 

Idk if I’m reading it right, but her friends stay in her room. If sally has sensitive hearing, but you don’t then surely that means Mathilda & friends are being respectably quiet? They are in her room and in my guidelines she is respecting your space. 

However, being snappy and argumentative like you say can cause a lot of tension and potentially ruin friendships. 

So ESH because this seems like because she is deflecting, everything she does is annoying to you two. If you let her down gently then that’s okay, however maybe just Sally should’ve told her, if she is the only one on the lease.

"AITA for using the money I won in a lottery to finance my own dream vacation across Europe/Asia besides on my kid’s student loan debt?. On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I’ve put $7,500 into my wife’s car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I’m planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I’ve never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.

Well yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I’m financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying “instead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt”.

I told her that I’d be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she’s looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. 

I told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn’t want to “miss out on the prestige” (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.

She’s brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it’s not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.

I told her that he’d be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.

I thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to “persuade” me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I’m being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.

Now I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they’re both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?

EDIT I'm not leaving my wife behind; she can go for 10 days. She can't take the full 1.5 months off, though.","Dude. You are NTA. It’s your money. 29k in college debt is not that much.

"AITA for telling a friend I’d rather her not come on my birthday trip if she can’t afford it?. I (20f), 21st birthday is coming up in about a month. I have been planning a trip about two hours away from where I live, I am only staying one night and am bringing 4 of my closest friends (all 21-23f).
 
For some background, all of us currently have jobs except one friend who I will call K. About a year and a half ago K was working but started to experience a lot of stress related to school and felt she couldn’t handle working at the time, she quit her job and hasn’t been working since. We all supported her, if thats what she felt was best. Often times K can’t attend dinner or activities we plan due to money issues. At times someone in the group is able to cover her as we understand her financial situation, but that is not always the case. Sometimes K will tag along with our plans anyway, despite not having money and no one being able to pay for her, and she kind of just sulks the whole time, and looks miserable. We feel terrible, but she insists on coming. 

About 2 days ago,I reached out to K privately before making a chat with everyone attending the trip and told her what we were doing, I chose to eat at a Brazilian steakhouse ($57 per person), go out to a club (~$20 per person) and that we were splitting costs of weed ( legal where we’re going) and alcohol since everyone would be partaking in it (~$35 per person), so total price estimate ~$112. She said she would be able to attend, I was surprised but excited, and left it at that. Yesterday, K said she would no longer be able to attend. K told me initially that her mother agreed to lend her some money, but when K asked for $112 her mother said she would only give her $30. Obviously this leaves, $82 she would still need. K suggested that she still go but only go to dinner, and she would stay at the air b n b from the club, or that maybe we skip the club all together and just party at the air b n b. She also tried to suggest we cook something vs eating out. I told her that honestly I’d rather have her not come because she has a bad habit of insisting to go somewhere knowing she can’t afford it and then sulking through the whole thing. I also told her that I would not be changing any of my birthday plans as in not going to a club, or picking a different restaurant. In response, she said “okay” and I haven’t heard from her since. Today, one of my other friends called me and said that K had expressed to her how hurt she was by what I said. This friend also told me that I was being inconsiderate. I feel it’s my birthday and if that’s what I want to do, that I’m going to do it. But maybe I should be more accommodating??

I hope you can make it but I understand if you can’t and hope we can celebrate together at another time.”

"AITA for not buy my wife birthday/holiday gifts?. Context:  during Christmas of last year I (M26) purchased my wife (F26) three gifts.  A makeup set, a light purple bathrobe, and a Scentsy oil diffuser.  When she opened them I noticed an obvious lack of enthusiasm.  She opened them quickly, simply said thanks, and moved on.  After Christmas on our way home I asked her about it.  She stated outright that she didn't like them.  While these were things she had asked for I had missed obvious details on what she wanted.  Yes she had stated  she wanted a robe like her sister had gotten but that her sister's was neutral tones and that she wanted something white or light gray instead.t Yes she had asked for a diffuser but had told me to get a small model.  The one I bought was to big.   She said it was lazy gift giving.

I was pretty upset.  After a heated argument on the way home she left the gifts in the car.  they sat there for a week.  After a week I boxed them up and sent them back.  I asked her if she wanted them before I did and she said I could do what I wanted. After I did we fight about it again. we both end up angry and agreeing no more gifts for birthdays/Holidays.

Fast forward to valentines day.  I plan a dinner out and a walk through a light display in a nearby park.  My thinking is to replace gifts with events.  Nothing material.  I honestly thought it would be a nice compromise. During dinner she is obviously upset.  I ask her what's wrong and she tells me that she was one of only a few women at her work who didn't receive flowers.  I told her we had agreed ""no gifts"" and instead we were going to spend time together and do things.  She said flowers aren't a gift they are a show of love and that I was just being petty.  She stated \*Quote\* ""I'm sorry I made you feel bad during Christmas.  I didn't mean to.  But I want flowers on valentines day."" After that she says that she apologized and that this no gift thing isn't working.  I told her that apology wasn't very genuine and that I was holding to it.

During my birthday I'm to busy to do anything.  On a trip to the liquor store a few days before she asks if I want anything.  I tell her a Band I like and she buys me a bottle.

Her birthday rolls around and I plan a trip to a local festival she's been talking about and then an evening out.  The day comes, she enjoys the festival, we have a delicious meal and come home late.  When we get home she asks for her gift.  I tell her we agreed almost a year ago no gifts. She says I'm not showing her love or respect by being so spiteful.  I point out the agreement.  She states that after valentines day the agreement was off. From her view she had apologized and we should move one.  She yelled ""haven't I paid for Christmas enough yet"".  She reminded me about the bottle of liquor and how I had asked for it.  It all ended with her calling me an asshole and saying I'm holding the fact that she didn't like my gifts against her.

"AITA for kicking my roommates out?. My father owns a 3 family house. Me and my girlfriend are currently renting out the 2nd floor with two other girls. We signed a lease and it ends on February 29th, 2020.

For simplicity Roommates are CatLady and WeedGirl

CatLady has a cat. The poor cat is always meowing really loud because it receives no loving. She has an electric litter box, feeder, water fountain and air purifier she has running 24/7. 

WeedGirl smokes weed everyday. We’ve asked her to stop multiple times but never does. The 1st floor and 3rd floor have little kids and the smell of weed wreaks up the hallway. Our neighbors have asked her to stop because they don’t want their kids to smell it/ be around it. 

Both roommates are very lazy in terms of cleaning. Dishes get left in the sink for consecutive days. Bags of trash pile up in the kitchen and in their rooms.(I’ve seen them leave with multiple bags of trash on multiple occasions.

Catlady made a rotating schedule for cleaning. Each week one person cleans the common areas such as kitchen and bathroom. Which is fair except she put “take out trash “ as one of the tasks that needed to be done. Which is pretty unfair because CatLady and WeedGirl almost always order take out and deliveries and their trash piles up quick. Me and my girlfriend use small plastic bags. We fill up one everyday or two and take it out the same day. The two other girls decided to just leave all their trash in the kitchen and whose ever turn it was to do cleaning had to take all of their trash out too.

Both roommates started using the dishwasher for a small amount of dishes ( I’m talking two plates and pan).

WeedGirl started complaining about that the electrical bill and that it should be divided by 4. I disagree with this because I work 60/70 hours a week. When I am home I’m always with my girlfriend. It’s not like I’m using up any more electricity than if my girlfriend was by herself. But I reluctantly said I would pay an extra $30 towards the electrical bill instead of splitting it 4 ways.

CatLady has her sister over to stay the night. WeedGirl met them in the kitchen and they started talking. Out of nowhere I heard WeedGirl say “he’s really inconsiderate, he stays home all day, plays video games and uses up a bunch of electricity and pays nothing” this was the final straw.

There’s a bunch of other stuff that bothered us that would take me forever to list.

I told my dad to send our roommates a letter stating the lease was not going to be renewed and that they have to be out by February 29th.

I got home last night and heard WeedGirl screaming on the phone in her room. “wtf did I do. I don’t bother anyone. I can’t afford to move. I can’t put down a deposit for another apartment. This is my first year by myself and these assholes are kicking me out.” I have to admit I felt bad.

CatLady is gone for the weekend so no reaction from her yet.

"AITA for forcing our group of friends to only go to the accessible clubs?. I spend a large amount of time in a wheelchair. I can walk but stresses my body and leads to pain.

Friends and myself like to go out drinking on the weekends. Clubs, pubs etc. Friends suggest to go to new popular club, I'll say sure. Roll up there and find that it has step or stairs. It's gotten to the point where I'm saying to them that I'll only agree to clubs that are easily accessible to me. If people suggest a place I told them that if it's not accessible then they have to figure out a way for me to get in. This has caused massive friction with the guys and girls I'm going out with. I get it, the nicer/cooler/whatever places give them a better chance of hooking up. I really do want to experience some of those places myself but there's a barrier of entry.

Most of the time nobody wants to carry my chair into a club and bouncers often don't want to touch me because of liability reasons. So we go somewhere else, these are mostly places that are empty of with people but not our other extended friends. I can tell my friends are getting frustrated with me and often I get told the places I choose suck. This is true, most of the places I choose are shitholes, but shitholes I can enter and drink in.

"AITA for asking my friends to stop discussing sex?. I'm a flexible asexual. Basically, sometimes I'm entirely ace, fully repulsed by sex to the point of being physically sick when it's brought up. This can last anywhere between a few days, to a few weeks or even months at a time. 

I was going through a period of this when 2 of my friends in a large group chat starting getting into the nitty gritty details of some experience one of them had just had. No one else was engaging and I gently asked them not to discuss it in the group chat as it was making me highly uncomfortable and asked if they could use their private chat instead.

They laughed it off and continued. More firmly, I asked them to stop. At this point the rest of the chat chimed in and proceeded to bombard me with highly sexual things, making me incredibly uncomfortable and no one was listening when I begged them to just stop. 

I left the chat, to which they added me back in immediately. This continued for about 20mins before I stopped leaving the chat and just muted it instead and didn't talk to them for a week.

Am I the asshole for asking 2 people who were essentially spamming the chat to take their conversation elsewhere, for leaving the chat once everyone took the piss on me for even being ace, and then ignoring them until I was ready to speak to them again? 

Edit: to add, since some of you are recommending I get help over being sick over it. I'm in therapy already but thank you ","ESH.

"AITA for taking the coffee that u had just made for my GF grandmother and refusing to make her another one.. So let me start by saying this is a really small petty thing but my gf grandmother is the type of person to moan about everything, nothing is ever good enough for her.

So a few days ago, my gf grandmother come visited for a few hours and when she entered our place I asked if she wanted a drink, she asked for a coffee so I went into the kitchen to make her one. We had only just moved into the place and was decorating. On her arrival she had already told us how ugly our wallpaper was and new furniture. We just brushed it off.

After making her the coffee and handed it to her, she took one look and said ""nope, I can't drink this"" I said ""how comes, you haven't even tasted it yet?"" She said ""it's in a black mug, how am I meant to know if the mug is dirty or not"" I replied saying ""it's full off coffee, you can't see whether or not it's dirty regardless the colour"" she pushed the mug away and said ""take it back, make me a new one in a new mug"" I took the mug off her and said ""no, I'm not making you another coffee because you don't like the mug it's in, don't be so f**king pathetic"" 

I took the mug into the kitchen, poured it down the drain and went out for a drive till she left. 

When I come back my gf wasn't angry at me but she thinks I handled it wrong and said I acted like a bit of an asshole. So AITA guys? 

TL;DR : my gf grandmother come visited our new place, moaned about the wallpaper and furniture.

"AITA For telling my sister she should not have married her husband?. Ok, so I'm 19(M). My sister is 24. We were both born and raised in Australia, but our parents are from Greece. Our parents are quite poor.

When my sister finished year 12, she went to Greece to teach English for a year. In Greece, she met her now-husband (26M), who was a teacher at the school she was at. They got engaged after a few months and eventually married. I did meet him before they got married, and told her to think about what she was going to do. Her husband at the time was quite poor, and would likely be unable to support her.

After they got married, my sister started the immigration process. All in all, it cost her $10,000, which she saved from her time teaching in Greece.

Fast forward 1 year, that is now what is happening. Last year when they got married, she stayed there for a few months. When she returned to visit us in Australia, she was pregnant. She decided it was best to stay here to have her child. 

Now a bit about me. I'm 19(M) and have been fortunate enough to save money over the years. I'm proud to say that I have $22,000 in savings. 

A few months into her pregnancy, her husband wanted to visit Australia - his VISA was accepted. SHE paid for his visit, which I found ridiculous. She paid for everything while he was here - food, activities etc. She more or less used all of her welfare money on him.

Moving on from then, a few weeks ago, my sister had her baby. Now he wants to come again. However, this time she is asking me to pay for his ticket because she is broke and he obviously has no money. I politely said I would not do that. When she got on my case about it, I told her that if she didn't want to be in this situation, that she should never have married him

On top of that, I hate the way he talks to her and demands things. When the baby was born, my sister wanted to give the baby a specific name which he denied because ""the cousin he doesn't like has that name"". When she wanted to give her baby a middle name, he refused.  

AITA?","ESH

"AITA For being petty to a lady at work that hates me?. I know I've been posting a lot but I've had these questions, and I now I have the courage to post them. 

So at my job, we work on lines. Like conveyor belts. Well, there's this one lady who absolutely hates me. Everything I do she finds offensive. 

We joked about demons, and she was offened. I was talking to a girl about tampons vs pads and she was super offened. I even put some plastic wrap on my head and she was offened by that. To the point where she went to the line leader and complained.

"AITA for telling my Mom how I really feel about her boyfriend. Sorry for the wall of text, but I wanted to give as much perspective on the situation. As well sorry for any spelling, grammar, or format errors, I'm typing this on mobile. 

So my Mom has this boyfriend Tom, who I honestly can't stand. When she first introduced him to my sister and I, it was pretty clear my sister hated him. She tried calmy telling my Mom this, but she just ignored it (possibly because my sister moved far away for her job and thus has limited contact except for short visits). 

I have tried spending time around him but don't enjoy it. He has lied to Mom, practically cheated on her (long convoluted story there), and everything that comes out of his mouth is a complaint, or criticism of some sort of institution (often either the government or US Education system). He will endlessly talk during movies and TV shows either telling us every last biographical information on the actors, film crew, and producers for movies produced before 1970, and for those after poking at every minor plot hole, media trope, or character flaw.

My Mom has tried time and again to insert him into family functions but never warns us. He has attended Thanksgiving for the last two years, Christmas of 2017, and she has occasionally invited him to a family dinner without telling anyone (he is just there at her place when we arrived).

This all reached a head during last Thanksgiving. For my family Thanksgiving is a huge holiday filled with days of lots of good food and alcohol, that we all contribute to. He showed up the Thursday of and didn't leave. My sister just isolated herself in the guest room she was sleeping in, however as I sleep on the couch while I'm visiting, I could not escape him. I was distant and cordial until he started mocking my sister's eating habits and a few other thing, which she could hear because the apartment isn't that big. At that point I saw red, and while I kept quiet, I probably became rather curt with him. The best part of the holiday was the one morning he went back to his place and the tense atmosphere left with him.

This reached a head as the next time I saw my Mom, she tried to lecture me about being kind to her guests (yet I apparently don't count as one even though I don't live with her). I had to tell her that I tried to give him a chance but I can't stand him. The only nice things he has to say are about her, and I can see why his own son won't speak to him and I don't want to spend any time around him if I can help it. She tried to tell me to call him out on his behaviors I don't like, but I don't feel comfortable telling him he's acting like an ass and has to stop. After this she just got defensive and shut the conversation down.

And less than a month later when my sister comes up for Xmas, my Mom begins to act majorly passive aggressive and cold towards us. I tried to make things lighter and did slightly succeed, but overall the holiday felt hollow. On top of it my sister subtly informed us she has volunteered to work Thanksgiving and Xmas next year (and thus won't be around). The only positive thing was that Tom didn't show up. However, since then any interaction, if one occurs, with her feels strained and like she's not there. 

I am just hurt and livid as I'm watching my family fall to pieces because my Mom has decided this is her hill to die on. I understand she wants a partner to feel happy and fulfilled with, I just wish it was someone who didn't behave like an ass ninety percent of the time. Am Ithe ass hole here for telling her the truth in hopes she realizes how bad his behavior is?

"AITA for cancelling my party an hour before it was supposed to start?. Background: I’ve been off work for the last week and I’ve been feeling sort of lonely.  I took this time off to get healthier mentally as I’ve been struggling with my depression lately. 

As a result of being at work all the time, my only friends are work friends. I love pretty much every person I work with though! I feel like we’re a good team and have each other’s backs. We also hang outside of work sometimes and it’s always a blast. 

I decided on Monday to send out a group text (as well as a slack message) inviting my friends from work over to my house for a chill party/hang out, about 20 people in total. I wasn’t too worried about it being last minute since we work in a restaurant and can’t plan these things in advance anyhow. Anyway, a kick back with some good people sounded like just what I needed.

At first, I got a few yays, nays, and maybes, but probably 80% of that list didn’t even respond. I get that, I know I don’t really like participating in group texts.

Wednesday, after not hearing back from a lot of people, I texted the group chat telling everyone that they should text me either there or individually so I could get an accurate head count for snacks. I got like 2 more yays, so yay! But 2 of my yays turned to maybes cause those two people said their attendance depended on if certain other people weren’t going to be there. But I followed up with those two people a few hours later telling them the people they’re avoiding haven’t even said anything so it’s probably ok for them to come! Radio silence from both of them though. 

Thursday (the day of the party) after class I bought all the supplies and spent 3 hours cleaning and decorating my house. The time of my party is fast approaching and I receive a few cancellation texts (in the group text) from previously confirmed people, which is no biggie. But it’s 9:30 at this point (party starts at 10-ish when everyone starts getting off work) and I only have 3 confirmed guests. 

Obviously I was super bummed. I guess my feelings got the better of me so I shot out a quick text that I think this night might not be working well for everyone, that I was calling it off and would be changing it to a better date in the future. Then I turned off my phone and cried a bit, drank the beer I bought, and went to sleep. 

I turned on my phone when I woke up this morning and had 12 texts saying that a lot of people were planning on coming and that they’re sad the party is off. 

Part of me feels like a dick for cancelling the party so last minute. But part of me is also really angry that almost no one took the multiple chances over 4 days to tell me that they planned on coming. When I specifically asked them to. 

AITA here? I feel guilty for doing it really last minute, but I also feel right. The 3 confirmed people were all working that night anyhow so they hadn’t even gotten off yet. I guess I don’t mind if I inconvenienced the others who didn’t say anything though. I had no idea they were coming.



I’m going to apologize to them personally and communicate better next time! So thanks guys! I feel better about everything and am thankful for the feedback cause it’s hard to see things clearly when it’s clouded in emotion. 

Also no more group chats, the consensus is that they suck lol",ESH- Your friends suck for not communicating or RSVPing but you suck for cancelling on the people who did confirm. You basically told them they weren't a good enough reason to come over to your home.,1,0,1,0,0

"AITA for pinching a ladies arm fat at the dinner table?. So before I even get into it, I wanna preface this by saying I have always considered myself TA in this situation. However, I recently remembered this event and thought I’d get a second opinion. 

Also sorry for formatting, and English isn’t my first language. 

This happened about 3 years ago so I was 16F at the time. My mom had been friends with our neighbor Ann for a couple of years, and since she lived a couple houses down she would visit frequently. Before this event I had a couple encounters with Ann, and she always made me uncomfortable because she was constantly talking about weight loss and dieting. 

Now there is nothing wrong with wanting to lose weight. However, Ann would always be talking about 30 day cleanses where she would do nothing but drink water with lemon and Kayan pepper. Essentially starving herself. When she wasn’t on her cleanse she was mostly eating unhealthy foods so her weight would constantly fluctuate. She would swear by this method, and would also brag about how she had been doing this for 15+ years. 

She was also always trying to convince my mom and I to try this ‘diet’. I particularly remember one time when I was 14 she took me out to dinner, and told me that I should attempt this diet(because like most girls at that age I was self conscious of my body and wanted to lose weight). She described it to me in great detail, and bragged about how she had been skinnier than most girls(with the implication that she was skinner than me at my age) while she was in school. 

This actually led to me trying to restrict what I was eating, but I’ve always loved food so I wasn’t super successful(luckily). Fast forward 2 years, I had started working out and actually improving my body in a healthy way. So one evening my mom invites her over for dinner, and once again she’s going on and on about her cleanse. So I told her that her method was extremely unhealthy, and would mostly lead to loss of muscle and water weight. I explained that eating healthier and working out would be a lot more beneficial in the long run. 

She started getting pretty angry at what I was saying, and began to argue that she was healthy and her diet has worked her whole life. This is the part where I’m most likely TA. I started getting pretty worked up, and in the heat of the moment I reached over and squeezed her arm fat between my fingers. This was a gentle squeeze, but it pretty much highlighted the point I was making about loss of muscle. She got extremely upset, and I ended up leaving dinner early. 

I know I’m probably TA in this situation, and I’ve always felt bad about how I handled things. I would never do something like this now, but I thought I’d put this out there and get some outside opinions.","ESH
Grabbing someone while arguing is a bad idea on many levels, so doing that does make you an asshole... But pressuring a teenager into unhealthy dieting is way, way more harmful in the long run. It was good that you stood up to her, even if you didn't do so in the most graceful way.

"AITA for Pressuring a Partner into Taking Plan B. I have been seeing a woman for about 2 weeks, and on Sunday we were both drunk and had unprotected sex. We agree that this was very dumb, and we will be more adamant about condom usage in the future. Afterwards, she told me that she was not on any form of birth control, as she does not like being on hormonal BC.

&#x200B;

She tells me there is nothing to worry about because her period ended on Saturday, so her cycle makes a pregnancy very unlikely. She is also very pro-choice, and says she will get an abortion (no discussion) if it comes to that. I would agree that this is the right course of action if she does become pregnant.

&#x200B;

I thought her rationale over for a day, but it was still stressing me out. Since we were still in the 72 hour effective window, I thought Plan B was a very good idea here. The way I see it, even if a pregnancy is very unlikely, why not take actions to reduce that risk even further? Even if we are 100% agreed on getting an abortion, why not try to avoid that situation altogether? The side effects of Plan B seem pretty benign, but I cannot know for certain how they will be for her.

&#x200B;

She's taking the Plan B, but is pretty upset with me. I feel like I might have been insensitive to her right to do what she wants regarding her own health.

Edit: Some more context based on the comments.

Last night I called her after work to say I don't think her confidence around fertility cycles is well-advised and we should consider Plan B. She responded that she can understand my stress, but has no time to go to the pharmacy. I thought that was a pretty bad reason and offered to go myself and bring it to her apartment. She then said the conversation was stressing her out and we'd talk in the morning.

Early this morning she texted to ask if I still wanted her to take a Plan B. I said I think it's the best idea. I paid for it, I don't really care about the 50 dollars. I'd pay for the entire abortion if it came to that: this is my fault and I have emergency savings for a reason.

I do feel like the asshole here, because I can only read about the side effects of hormonal bc on the internet and have no real context for myself as a man. From internet sleuthing, I read most women tolerate Plan B just fine, but there are exceptions there's no certainty for her.

"AITA For calling my mom out on her drinking problem??. I'm on mobile. Also this is very ranty.
I am an 18yr old female. Oldest of four, I have a mom and dad. This might be a long one but I would appreciate to know. TL;DR is at the bottom.

 The drinking problem has been going on for about 10ish years. Off and on my mom will go on these drinking sprees ever since she had a weight loss surgery 10 years ago. It started out as a glass of wine a night to help with the pain. (The nature of the surgery made alcohol affect her way easier and faster) Then the alcohol type and amount got worse. The drinking became less to do with pain and became a solution to sleep better and now she drinks whenever she is stressed.

So skip to present day, and our family recently has undergone a lot of stress. Its a long story that I don't want to get into. But I am getting tired of coming home from school to find my mother black out drunk on her bed. I really don't like that my siblings are exposed to that.

Last night I had enough, I waited till she was sober enough and lost it on her. I told her how was wasting money, setting a bad example, destroying herself, that its embarrassing (she will go into public in this state), and that being stressed isn't an excuse to get drunk.

This isn't the first time I've confronted her about the problem. Just the first time that my family was around to witness it. Now every time I've called her out she just starts crying and saying that she should just leave. All of that emotional manipulation jazz. She starts doing this and my dad a long with my siblings start treating me like the bad guy in this situation.

Also I wasn't just insulting her I was offering other ways to handle stress and to get her help because I wanted my mom to be able to meet her grandkids. But the rest of my family started attacking me, verbally but still, and weren't making any sense to me that they are just going to let her drink herself to death. They've just turned a blind eye! My dad of all people thought I would be on my side because he lost his dad due to alcoholism!

So...

AM I THE ASSHOLE FOR CALLING OUT MY MOM ON HER DRINKING PROBLEM BECAUSE I DONT WANT HER TO DIE?!

"AITA for making a big scene at the soup kitchen. Some context: I used to work at Walmart as an associate. I'm also a university student in my mid-20s, but haven't spoken to family in many years, so I'm 100% self-dependent. About a month ago, I had a pilonidal cyst surgery (a painful cyst above your asscrack that gets worse without surgery).

"AITA for gifting candles every secret santa?. There's a £25 limit every year, and I get the biggest candle Yankee Candle offers which usually comes out around 23-24 quid. This is due to a combination of me not wanting to get my coworker something that could be deemed inappropriate and me just really liking candles.

There's sometimes personalisation to it in that if I see them using a particular perfume/body spray then I'll google what scents are in that and get the candle with that scent, but for the most part I just get the themed ones. The coworker I got this was New Girl, who's only been here a month or so, and I had no idea what she might like so I got a holiday themed one called ""After Sledding"".

This is my fourth consecutive year of working here, being in the secret santa, and gifting candles. The people I've gotten for the last 3 years still work here. We are allowed to place the gifts on our coworker's desks any time in December, and I'm using up some holiday leave between the start of next week and new years day, so I left the candle on New Girl's desk today.

New Girl saw the candle, yelled a ""thanks"" to the room (we take the ""secret"" part very seriously) and the woman who sits on the desk opposite me, who I've had for secret santa previously, goes ""oh, you must have got my old santa!""

It’s just not my business, and yes I could just not watch his stories and I usually don’t. 

Would I be the asshole though? I don’t wanna have to explain to him why I deleted him, which means I would have to delete him on Facebook too. That just seems a little harsh without warning. He’s a really sweet guy... but...

Note: I realize he probably shares it for some kind of attention or help. But I don’t think Snapchat is the right place for that","NAH - it’s understandable you don’t want to take on his pain, but the things he posts are a cry for help. If you deleted him out of nowhere and he noticed, it could make him feel worse. It’s probably better to explain to him how his posts affect you, and that he should seek professional help. If he’s in his 20s like you said in another comment, then he doesn’t need his parents’ permission to see doctors and he can get the help he needs privately.",0,0,0,1,0
"WIBTA if I cut my mom out of my pregnancy until the baby comes?.  I'm 34 weeks pregnant, and this is my first pregnancy. The third trimester has obviously been hard. I don't know anyone my age (27) who is pregnant who lives near me or has had children, so I've been talking a lot to my mom about the pregnancy. This will be her first grandchild and she's very excited.

My mom adopted me. I love my mother dearly, but she does not have maternal instincts. She is not a warm and fuzzy person at all. She will say whatever is on her mind, even if that's not quite what the situation is calling for. My mom has never been pregnant, but she's known a lot of pregnant people (i.e. her sister, her nieces), so I've never felt like I can't talk to her about it. However this morning after a particularly rough morning (I just started having minor contractions) I called her to tell her how miserable I was and how much I just wanted to go home and crawl into bed. Her response was ""I think the biggest mistake you've made was going off your medication. Pregnant women don't have this hard of a time and you need help because all you do is complain.""

Before I got pregnant I was on anxiety medication that my doctor advised me could be unsafe during pregnancy, so after a long conversation with them, I went off it before I got pregnant. I also felt at the time that it was no longer helping me,  and I felt great after I went off it. I've been feeling worse as this pregnancy has gone on, but I think that's kind of normal.

I pointed all of this out to her and she didn't retract her statement. I then told her I was really hurt by what she said because it felt like she was basically writing me off, and that I really only complain to her about my pregnancy woes because I don't have anyone else to talk to. She said she didn't mean to be hurtful, but didn't apologize.

After a heated back and forth, I hung up the phone in tears and called my husband. I told him that I do not want to talk to my mom anymore about my pregnancy until the baby comes because I don't feel that she is capable of giving me the support that I need, in fact she is stressing me out even more. She was planning on coming to stay with us a week before my due date to help out around the house, but I do not want her to do this anymore because I think it will add even more stress. He said that if I tell her this, the situation will be even worse, and that it will be very hard for her to be ""cut out"" of the remainder of my pregnancy. I know she'll be really hurt and offended but I'm really upset about her behavior and I don't think she'll apologize for it, and I don't need the extra stress right now, so I just don't think that she should come stay with us, or that I can give her updates about my pregnancy anymore.

WIBTA?","NAH. I've had 4 pregnancies and 3 children. So I get hormones, pressure from loved ones, and anxiety. I think you need to take care of yourself and put yourself first. Of course. I just think you should alter the plans slightly. 

First, if your mom has always been like this, this is an expected situation. However, I'm very sorry you don't have the support system you need. Please subscribe to r/parenting and r/mommit for more support online if you haven't already. 

If I were you, I would ask her to come the week AFTER you have the baby. Before the first baby comes, you'll probably be better off with alone time. Honestly. You will be in charge of someone's life after the baby comes, so the alone time before your first baby should not be taken lightly. 

Having her come the week after the baby comes benefits you and her in so many positive ways. For one, the first week you have baby, YOU or HUBBY will want to be the ones holding baby all the time. If your mom is staying with you and helping out, you will feel obligated to give her a lot of those first snuggles. If she's getting on your nerves, that will be amplified. You're still going to want to hold baby all the time the second week, but you'll be more ready to give up some of the times. You'll also have your one week check up with your OB, and assess if you need any postpartum mood stabilizers.

Also, a week after baby comes, you'll run out of people coming to bring you food and do little visits. It would be nice to have mom help so light cleaning, laundry and perhaps cooking at this time. Plus, you'll have a better idea of what you'll actually need help with. Maybe having her come up with a system for taking a shower, preparing meals, waking up to feed baby but still fall back to sleep, etc. You'll probably want to do your own coffee run to breathe for a minute, and she'll be someone trusted you can leave baby with. These are all things you pretty much figure out in week two when you have baby in your arms. It'll be really nice to have someone around that you love and trust and who loves you and baby.

I'm just saying, a week after the chaos starts, is a much better time to have help, than the week before.",0,0,0,1,0

"AITA for letting my GF choose between having more intimacy aka kissing or her smoking habit ??. Hello Redditors,

Let me give you some background information.  
I think me and my girlfriend always had one point that we struggle with.  
She smokes, I don't. Her parents smoke a lot too. Their house always smells and is yellow/brownish from the nicotine.  
I hate the smell it gives, I hate the way her breath smells afterwards/her hair/clothes virtually everything she's like a walking cigarette.

I knew this from day 1 I was actually kinda devastated after the first date.  
I had the best date in ages and she was amazing in every single thing except afterwards she apologizes herself to go smoking. I told her my honest opinion what I thought about it and how much I hated the smell of tobacco. But her good things were outweighing the bad one(s). She promised me she would stop smoking, she wanted to quit for longer.

So we got involved into a relationship and during that first time I was intimate with her.  
She did try all kinds of tricks to make it more bearable.

1. Brushing her teeth/mouthwash
2. Mints or chewing gum

**Other tips are more than welcome!**

But it would only help a little I never could really enjoy kissing her and did it more to please her. We decided to move in with each other and she told me that would be a great time to stop smoking. So the day we moved in together she quit smoking for over 6 weeks. I have to say this time was golden because we were intimate much more often. I would surprise kiss her out of the blue and I truly enjoyed the fact that it was a great feeling to kiss her passionately.

You probably can guess where I am going. After the 6 weeks a stressmoment came and the first thing she does is go for the cigarettes again. She confessed to me crying she had been smoking. I told her don't worry just continue the path your on. So fast forward a couple days, she said she couldn't take it anymore and started smoking again fulltime. And she smokes a lot!!

First I was disappointed and felt let down. After a while I accepted the fact that she started to smoke again. After all she does it outside/not inside. 

But this week we got into an argument because she feels the drop in intimacy, kissing, and all the things I did when she was smoke free. 

AITA because I refuse to do that because it super unpleasant to me... ? I gave her a clear choice. Either you don't smoke for the day and we can kiss all day long. Or you choose your habit over the added intimacy and I refuse. She said it's unfair to put her to the choice because in the beginning of the relationship I just kissed again my will to please her. The only moment I can still do it is when she wakes up... The night makes sure that all the nicotine/tobacco smell is gone and I am all fine with kissing her. 

What's the verdict? :) Are there any couples here with smoker/non smoker, how do you cope? Any tricks????!","NAH- you shouldn't have to ""kiss an ashtray"" (my dad's quote) and she doesn't have to quit smoking, but she needs to understand that not everyone is going to like it.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for asking my (sexually exclusive) partner to quit drinking for my sobriety?. I say exclusive partner because we didn’t have titles yet. I (21 F) told him (23 M) I didn’t want a relationship in the beginning but then changed my mind (and told him that) shortly after when I saw how much I liked him. We had been intimate for over three months and agreed to be exclusive because we admitted catching feelings for one another. From the beginning I have been very transparent about my road to recovery. I have mentioned how important it is that I remain sober. My DOC is (in order) alcohol, weed, and cocaine.  I have slipped around 4 times (with alcohol only) in the past 8 months. Not proud of it but I still take my sobriety very seriously. After seeing if I could handle the guy who I began to take serious drinking around me or going out and staying sober, I still had major temptation. I asked if he would quit for me altogether and he said no. This shocked me since we had been hanging out almost every day. AITA? I hate giving ultimatums but I couldn’t see another way around it. Yet, he rejected the idea immediately. He hasn’t made much of an effort to remain friends after which has me second-guessing myself.","NAH.

You're allowed to have boundaries. In this case, this boundary is vital for you, as it's essential to not have temptations around for you to be able to stay on the wagon.

The person you were seeing is equally allowed to not be okay with respecting those boundaries. He's within his rights to not be sober.

It just means you two are incompatible. Ultimatums are often unreasonable and unnecessary - but this isn't one of those times where the ultimatum was bad.

You did what's right for you. You're not an asshole. 

Don't second-guess yourself; rather, be proud that you could stand up for your own needs.

"AITA:No longer wanting to help my bf advance his career.. AITA: For no longer caring or wanting to help my bf advance his career?

I'll try to be as succinct as possible while giving enough details.

My bf has hit a roadblock in his job and has remained stagnant in a position that is going nowhere. He has the knowledge, skill, and potential to go very far in his career but he does not have the right attitude. A few months ago he was turned down from a promotion and given the feedback that he needs to change the way people perceive him. He is a ""negative Nancy;"" always complaining about how management doesn't care or want to fix things, etc.

He comes home to me and constantly complains about this. I've had more experience moving up the corporate ladder and how to navigate office politics so I've seen it all. And from my experience, his attitude really is the problem. The issue is, he thinks everyone else is the problem and he isn't being treated fairly. I've tried to explain using my own experiences as examples but he does not believe me. It's gotten to the point where I've completely shut down from even talking about this topic.

Today while I'm at work he texts me that a different manager had a heart to heart conversation with him telling him basically the same thing I told him months before. He accepted the feedback but did not get the message. He still thinks it's management's fault and everyone is against him. In the text he said:

>Yes I know. Rather than complain, provide solutions or do something about it. But I can't fix the problem when managers don't manage properly...

I want him to succeed and do better, but I can't change a person that does not want to change. I tried to engage in the conversation this morning and all I got back was more negative finger pointing. Honestly, it's starting to piss me off as it feels as if he does not trusts or values my opinion. I offered my advice and he chose not to take it so I'm done offering.  This makes me feel guilty and I don't like it. ","NAH

You're not being an asshole by being fed up and he probably could find a better way to vent, but I think we all need the safe space to do that (even when we're refusing to see ourselves as the problem).

I think it could be a better use of your time to stop him and ask a very simple question, ""Do you want my help or do you just want to complain?"" Ask him that question and respect his answer. If he says he wants help and then refuses your suggestions, stop the conversation and walk away from it. But you may find that he pauses and says, ""You know what, I just want to complain"" and then you can save yourself the headache of arguing with a brick wall. Even if you disagree with his complaints, let him vent. If he can get all the anger and frustration out, he'll be more receptive to criticism. ",0,0,0,1,0
"WIBTA if I blocked my sisters texts. I'm (29F) very childfree, as in, I do not want to have children. I find infants disgusting and children of most ages make me uncomfortable. 

My older sister (30F) is a complete attention whore and it has only gotten worse since she gave birth to my niece. She knows I don't like babies or being bombarded with baby pictures yet she keeps flooding my text messages with pictures of my niece.

"WIBTA for asking my housemates (and close friends) to give their dog a 'normal' hair cut?. I live my two close friends, who i'll call David and Chloe. David (46) and Chloe (43) are married and have a little Schnauzer (Doggo). I currently rent a room from them and live in their spare room. We've lived together for 2 years and i'd considered all 3 of them to be some of my closest friends. All 3 of us work full-time, as such, Chloe would take Doggo to work with her on Wednesdays and Thursdays. However, Chloe dislikes taking Doggo to work with her as she works 12 hour shifts and doesn't have the time to walk Doggo as much whilst at work and Doggo is bored for most of the day. Therefore, around 6 months ago she asked if I could take Doggo to work with me instead, as I work in a dog-friendly office, there are multiple pups in my office, and I can also take him for more walks, and as my office is more relaxed I can play with Doggo and keep him (and me) entertained. Needless to say Doggo is way happier coming to my office. They don't pay me for this, and I never asked or wanted any payment. Instead, I enjoy spending time with Doggo and he massively helps my social anxiety. I usually dislike going out in public and become extremely paranoid, although this has gotten better over the years, to the point it's now manageable. Furthermore, when Doggo is with me I feel somewhat normal and comfortable in public.

However, recently, David and Chloe decided to give Doggo a 'unique' haircut, basically a huge mohawk. Previously, Doggo didn't get much attention when I took him to work, but now literally everyone stares at both me and him, which is absolutely destroying me and making my anxiety unbearable. To the point that i'm too afraid to walk him or take him to work, so for the past 2 weeks (since the haircut) I've been making excuses to not take him to work with me. WIBTA if I tell them that I can't take him out with me unless he goes back to his normal haircut?

I feel like I would be the arsehole here as it's not my dog and Doggo seems to like the attention and i don't want to impede on Doggo's happiness. Basically, it's selfish of me to ask.

&#x200B;

I don't actually plan on asking them to cut Doggo's hair, I just plan on saying I can't take him to work with me anymore, which I think sucks for both me and Doggo, but equally I don't want to be an arsehole and I don't want to take him with his current haircut as it will worsen my mental health which I've worked tirelessly over the past 8 years to improve.","NAH 

It's their decision to cut his hair as they like, since doggos cannot decide on their own haircut. However, it's also your decision to not take doggo to work. 

I think a calm discussion will solve this issue, because they will be interested that doggo is happy and you taking him to your work.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for refusing to invite my best friend on hiking/camping trips?. For reference, my best friend (“N”) and I are in our late 20’s. 

I live in British Columbia and the outdoors is incredible. Tons of beautiful places to explore. I’ve been hiking for the last decade (before it was trendy thanks to social media) and for the last 3 years my best friend has come with me. He goes to take pictures of himself to post on Instagram and this fact always irked me but I overlooked it bc I liked his company. 

Progressively our trips became more and more like photo shoots for him to take the “best” pictures. It became 30-45 mins of posing sometimes at the same spot for pictures. In the summer it gets crazy busy and I get so annoyed.  I brought it up to him twice but he didn’t take me seriously. 

Last summer he brought a friend “L” on one of our 14-hour day hike. I warned them in advance that the hike was a little more difficult and to bring proper shoes, snacks, etc. On the hike, L and N wore improper shoes and ended up complaining endlessly about blisters, not bringing enough snacks, the crowds...anything you can think of. At the top of the mountain, they changed attires (seriously..shoes and shirt) and proceeded to dart around and get in everyone’s ways to take pictures for no less than an hour. I was annoyed and embarrassed by their actions and I sat to the side and kept to myself. They didn’t even notice nor try to keep my company. I silently vowed I wouldn’t go hiking w them again. After 1.5 hours it was time to descend before the sun set so I went over to them where they were both sitting, hunched over, editing their Instagram pictures. After that trip, I mentioned to N that I didn’t like being a photographer and that I hike because I love doing it, not for the pictures. He dismissed me by rolling his eyes and saying I “wasn’t any fun.”

I know them both well enough to know that they are obsessed with taking pictures of themselves and I don’t anticipate them stopping. 

N recently brought up the topic of going on hiking trips this year with L and I and I bluntly told him that I had a horrible time last year and I wasn’t planning on doing any big hikes with them bc knew I’d have to put up with their behaviour which ruins my experience. 

He now is ignoring me and thinks I’m being “judgemental.”  I highly doubt I’m TA but maybe I am? Should I suck it up?

"AITA for refusing to meet someone who drove 4-5 hours to see me?. This thing happened to me a couple years ago (I was 16 then, I'm 20 now) but I was talking to some friends last night and it came up. It's been a few years and I'm still wondering if what I did was right or not, so I thought I'd ask.

I had been talking with this guy online for about 6 months. He was 17 and I had his social media, with proof that he was a real person and not a catfish or anything like that. We'd talked about meeting in person but whenever we looked up trains we were talking over £100 each way (so £200+ for a round trip), and about the same just to meet halfway, and as neither of us had the money we couldn't do it. He lived 4 or 5 hours away driving and the day he got his license he texted me with a picture of the license and a message telling me he aced his test.

The day after he told me that he had his license, he texted me asking me what I was doing. I responded that I was just at home. He asked me if I knew \[name of local park\], and I said yes. He then said he was there and he wanted to see me. I panicked and turned off my phone and never replied. A few hours later I turned my phone back on and there was a series of texts from him talking about how he was putting himself out there by making a big romantic gesture and begging me to meet him. Final text said he was going home and not to contact him again. I didn't say anything back, he blocked me that day, and I haven't heard from him since.

I told my friends at school what happened and they were divided because he was asking to meet in a public place in broad daylight so it's not like anything could have happened, plus we'd been talking for months and had discussed meeting up, and he had my home address but he still went to the park presumably so I'd be comfortable. However, he was a stranger who decided to surprise me for our very first meeting and I had no idea he even liked me in a romantic way, and I only liked him as a friend and thought the whole relationship was totally platonic.

"AITA for filling up my mom's ""Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen"" box with fried chicken from the grocery store several times a week?. Looking for some real judgement here. About 3 months ago my mom was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and really couldn't move anymore, so I let her move in with me. I am broke as fuck and I live paycheck to paycheck so it's been a struggle. At this point we are just waiting for hospice to be approved and the doctors to decide when we move her over. 

On top of all this my mom has never been a nice person, she's still not. She's rude, she's demanding, she's half out of it 90% of the time which makes her even worse. She was abusive to me and my brother growing up. I'm letting her live with me because honestly I hope I get some real karma out of it and maybe some day my life will turn around. I don't have a lot of motherly love for her and really I just tolerate her being around. 

Her last real pleasure in life is Popeye's chicken. She loves the stuff. But it's expensive as fuck and very honestly I can't afford to stop there 5, 6 even 7 times a week. So after the first week, every time she'd ask for it, I'd just grab a Popeye's box from the trash, stop by the grocery store (if you buy their fried chicken after 8pm it's literally 1/5th the cost of Popyeye's) and fill up the Popeye's box. 

For a while it was fine and she didn't notice the difference but recently the doctor's have slightly altered her post-chemo medications which I assume means that she regained some sense of taste and she threw a holy fucking fit. She called the local Popeye's and bitched out every one she could. This saved me for a few days because they gave her two gift cards and one this like huge ass picnic meal that kept her in Popeye's for the last few days. 


I don't know what I'm going to do when the gift cards run out...I really think my thing is to keep buying the grocery store chicken and hope she doesn't notice.

AITA for complaining too much?. I’ll give a little context. My roommate is literally the best friend I have. We get along great but there’s one thing I think that drives both of us nuts. We have super thin walls and I’m the worlds lightest sleeper. She’s the worlds heaviest sleeper. I will wake up if someone even goes up and down the stairs. She sleeps through her alarms. She constantly falls asleep with her TV on and it’s so loud I can hear it from the floor above us and under us. She’s directly beside me and I can hear every word it’s saying. I truly think she has some kind of hearing issue. She will also use her vacuum at midnight and talk on the phone (loudly) until 2/3 am. It’s gotten a lot better now that she has a day job but it occasionally still happens. I’ve asked her to change these behaviors each time it happens and she immediately stops and apologizes but they happen so frequently I feel like an AH for complaining so often.

"AITA for banging on my apartment neighbor's wall in the middle of the night to get them to quiet their crying baby?. I live in an apartment and one of the walls in my bedroom is shared with my neighbor’s bedroom. I haven't had much interaction with my neighbors, but a young couple lives there and they had a baby about 9 months ago. For the first few months, the baby would cry in the middle of the night, but I would hear one of the parents get up to soothe it after a few minutes. I was annoyed because I was getting woke up, but I never considered complaining during this time. After 3 or 4 months, the crying got better and it would rarely week me up.

About a week ago, the crying started back up and it was worse than ever. The first night, the baby started crying a bit after 11. After a while, the crying sounded worse (the cries were high-pitched and the baby sounded like it was out of breath between sobs). I waited for over half an hour thinking the crying would end soon, but I eventually went to the living room to watch TV. When I went back to bed it was quiet, but later that night, the crying started again, so I ended up sleeping on the couch. When the baby was crying, I didn't hear the parents trying to comfort it. It's possible they did, but in the past, I could hear them getting out of bed or talking through the wall after the baby had cried for a while.

There have been similar long crying episodes most nights since then. Most of those nights, the baby would start crying around 11. There would also usually be another crying episode later in the night. After the crying would go on for a few minutes, I would check the time then either try to sleep or play on my phone. If the crying went on for over half an hour, I went to the living room to watch TV or sleep on the couch for a while. 4 of the last 6 nights, the baby has cried for over half an hour.

Two days ago, I saw the baby's mom in the hallway. I haven't really talked to her besides saying hi, but I told her I've heard a lot of crying the past few nights and asked if everything was okay. I doubt she would have told me if anything was wrong, but I thought I'd be polite. She told me everything was fine, the baby has just been fussy. Then I asked her if she'd mind moving the baby to another room if it cried for a long time because it was loud in my bedroom and she told me yes and sorry.

The night I talked to the mom, there was another long crying episode and I didn't hear the parents getting up or talking. The same thing happened the next night (last night), so after half an hour, I got up and banged on the wall for about 10 seconds. I heard one of the parents get up and the crying stopped soon after, so they must have soothed it or moved it to another room.

When I told a coworker I banged on my neighbor's wall to get them to quiet their crying baby, she said I was an asshole because they can't control their baby's crying and they’re new parents. I think it was justified. AITA?","Oh, gee, here we go: baby involved so OP is automatically the arsehole...

NAH. Yeah, babies cry, and yeah, that might be difficult for the parents, but that doesn't mean you have to put up with it. Good on you for talking to the mother; she seemed understanding. It sounds like they're using the method where they just let the baby cry it out, but they could still move it to another room like the mother said she would. They live in an apartment just like you do; people telling you this and that you gotta put up with the noise aren't considering that *they* live in an apartment too. They have to be aware of their neighbours, and their ""let it cry"" method isn't the best in this environment. Might be working (somewhat), but they can still move the kid to another room, since they know it's keeping you up.

If this keeps going on, perhaps you should invest in some earplugs or talk to the mum again. Good luck in your sleeping, OP!",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for buying a fur coat?. I’m conflicted about this one and could use some guidance here.

The other day I went vintage shopping with a friend and stumbled onto a stunning, brand-new mink coat with the original price tag still on it for about a hundred bucks. It had a small rip near the shoulder that I knew I could easily have repaired, and after a quick google search I discovered that it was made by a legendary furrier house that has made coats for celebrities dating all the way back to Rita Hayworth, Mae West, and etc., so I immediately decided to buy it. I am a huge vintage and consigned designer-shopping nerd and this just felt like such a steal, so I excitedly showed it to my friend, expecting her to share my excitement. Instead, she was pretty critical, urging me to buy the other (non-fur) jacket I was thinking about getting and telling me to think about whether fur is ethical.

Let me say now that I understand why some folks are opposed to wearing fur and other animal products on a moral basis. But I come from a cultural background where fur isn’t seen as controversial at all, and instead is just a sign that you’re financially secure. I consider myself an environmentalist on most levels, and actually eat vegetarian more often than not, but I simply do not have an ethical objection to wearing fur. In fact, I think buying fast fashion faux fur (which usually isn’t biodegradable, being essentially made of plastic) is much worse for the environment and the animals than having one really good fur coat you keep for years.

Suffice it to say, my friend disagreed and told me that was a cop-out. I was getting frustrated so I asked her why she was judging me for this when she wears leather and wool and silk all the time, and she got kind of flustered and said I was being an asshole. I let it drop but bought the coat anyway, and she’s been pretty frosty since then.

So like... was I the asshole for buying a fur coat in front of my (apparently fur-hating) friend?","NTA. To me, it's kind of like being a vegan. Eat what you want, but don't force others to do the same if it's not their lifestyle.

"WIBTA if I ask my wife for a day to myself?. Throw away due to friends and family possibly seeing this. Also sorry for any Grammer errors or formatting issues I'm on mobile. I included as much context and did my best not to overdo it either.

My wife (28) and I, 28(M) are expecting a baby. We are extremely excited for the new baby and for our daughter,  she's 2, to have a sibling.

My wife is still in the early side of the pregnancy. Just made it into the 2nd trimester. Pretty much since the beginning she has experienced some really bad nausea, on a daily basis. very often to the point where she can't do anything, let alone take care of our daughter when it gets at its worst. I've had to call someone to come help her out or even just pick up our daughter for my wife can concentrate on feeling better. She's a trooper, always doing her best to get through the day. 

I work full time job 5 days a week. So during the times shes really feeling sick it can be stressful because I'm to far to help. luckily like i said we have people that we have been able to count on and help out. when im home i dont mind taking on the load. I make sure shes good all day and if shes not i  make her go laydown and relax until she feels better.

Now like i said i do not mind being there for her and taking care of everything when shes not feeling good. but it is stressful, everyday when i get home shes usually going thru the worst of it or at least at some point when im home it happens. a little over 3 months in, im exhausted.

"AITA for withdrawing since my best friend didn't ask me to be a bridesmaid?. First post ever, and it's a long post, sorry. English isn't my first language so please have mercy on me.

So, the title might make me seem like TA, but here is the full story:

I have known my best friend since High School (18 years ago). We have been close ever since those important formative years. Through boyfriends, heartbreaks, disappointments, Joys etc etc.

She was in an abusive relationship about 8 years ago and as much as I loved her, I couldn't stand seeing the way he broke her down and insulted her, after really trying to get through to her, build her confidence etc, she took his side and and he obviously didnt like me, so we took a 4 year break. After about 3 - 4 years her eyes opened and she walked out of the relationship, we made contact and our friendship just started again where we left off. She was dating a great guy who my husband and I really liked, we enjoyed going out with them, she and I went househunting for her (and boyfriend), I was the first person she called when she got engaged, etc.

Anyway, even though we excitedly talked about her wedding, I realised recently that she has 4 bridesmaids and I didn't make the cut. It hurt. One would think that things won't hurt so much when you are over 30, but I spent nights crying with my wonderful but concerned hubby trying to  understand and cheer me up.

I got over it. I was originally thinking of not attending the wedding because I know that rejection will hurt and bring back some other experiences of rejection that I just managed to work through, but I manned up, realised it's about her and I'm going. But since I found out I have been withdrawing myself from her and from our friendship on the whole. I'm not being nasty or rude, I'm just not actively investing in our friendship any longer, not going out of my way to contact her first (but obviously responding and being friendly and supportive when she contacts me), etc. She recently told me that she and her husband2b will be emigrating to another country for a few years about 3 days after the wedding (later this month) and even though I am thrilled and overjoyed for the opportunity they have (and told her that), I don't think I will be going to much trouble to maintain a friendship once she has left.

I had a beautiful wedding gift made for them, two paintings that I will be framing, one with her and her hubby with travel gear and the other with the two of us depicting a special memory that we shared. This is more like a farewell gift from me. Something to cherish good memories while possibly not making any more anytime soon. 

AITA for practically ending (or at least downgrading) a friendship because I wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid? To me not being asked (she asked other friends) showed me that I really wasn't that important to her, so I'm wondering why I should invest so much into someone that doesn't even see me as one of their top 5 friends?

Edit: I should have mentioned that I did tell her about this. I wrote her a mail and made sure it wasn't confrontational at all or accused her of anything (it's her choice after all), I just said that I was feeling very hurt and rejected. She said she was truly sorry that I'm hurt (I believe her) but that it comes down to her wedding and it's done, so I kind of need to get over it. Which I did, but I decided that if she didn't see me as that important to her, I can probably do the same?","It's okay to quietly RSVP no, send the gift, and move on with your life.

"AITA for being upset two days later? gf of 4 years (29) was talking about her wild past. Hey, I'm ready for some hard truths

&#x200B;

Background - we haven't had a very interesting sex life in the past few months. In part for medical reasons, though there were still things we could and havent been doing. To be clear, no problems with what she's done before me or judgement, I've had my own 'wild past'. So me, tired and irrational, is there listening.

&#x200B;

gf came home from a night out with her work friends. When she got in I woke up, we were talking about how her night was. Apparently they were reminiscing about some old times from a few years ago when they were single.  She says about a threesome she had with two of her friends and says 

""it was amazing, glad it happened. never would again"". 

&#x200B;

The thought of her with the guy both turned me on and made me a bit jealous, though that's neither here nor there. I never had a threesome so it was something that became an unfulfilled fantasy when we became exclusive (she wasn't up for it anymore). It's still a bit of a sore spot as is it something I would have wanted to experience in this lifetime, but being with her is more important and long term. So this memory/sentence was a bit of salt on the wounds.

&#x200B;

So there I am, getting upset by what I see as this insensitive sentence for three reasons:

1 experience I'll never have with her (I know this is something I have to learn to let go of, I just dont know how, could appreciate advice there too)

2 seeing her reminisce about wild sex when we haven't had sex in ages makes it feel like we're all downhill from here (probably the only genuine one here)

3 Insecurity from this, why weren't we having drunk sex instead of her reminiscing/why would she let someone she cares less about have a threesome and not me (I know that one is petty)

So here's me two days later being crotchety and bitter, trying to let it go or figure it out and failing. not sure if there'd be any benefit to bringing this up other than making the situation worse (particularly about sex. once that's brought up as a problem I feel a line has been irreversibly crossed)

&#x200B;

TLDR - gf talking about a past threesome, saying 'amazing but never again', me getting upset because 

1 we didnt and wont do that together, 

2 we havent had sex in ages, 

3 insecurity, why not me. 

Now i'm still feeling upset two days later and am finding myself grumpy/aloof towards her. Hit me

Dude it’s normal to feel insecure about these things. You’re out of your normal pattern and you haven’t had sex in a while so you’re missing the closeness.

"AITA for not wanting to vacation with my inlaws?. My wife grew up in Mass and likes vacationing on Cape Cod like she did with her parents as a kid. We have a 7 year old daughter. Her parents have a second home up there. We had done a few vacations that I had planned and hadn't gone up to Cape Cod in a long time and last year she made it clear she wanted to go up to there to vacation and I said that would be fine. What I didn't realize when I agreed was that her parents would be there at the same time we would be there. Her parents are in their 80s. They enjoy going to church, sitting around doing crosswords and watching several hours of reruns of tv shows from the 60s and 70s before they go to bed. They don't like spending money. I can't fault them too much, they have two houses because they are misers, but at the same time their main residence inside looks like a decaying version of a 1970s Sears Catalog because they have never updated it and the Cape Cod house is furnished with anything they could get for free. There is a couch in the place that smelled like urine, that they got for free, which they insisted was fine. My wife admits it smelled like urine, but didn't want to get into it with them, but that's one piece of furniture I'm never using, ever.

We go up there last year at the end of the summer for a week and the inlaws are there. They basically disapprove of anything that I want to do that involves spending money and my wife doesn't want to argue with them so she goes along. There are a ton of good places to eat up there that I wanted to try out during the week, but my MIL will do things like make a bunch of cold cut sandwiches to take to the beach, but they aren't good cold cut sandwiches, they are cheapo low end plastic package cold cuts and Wonder Bread. Then she insists on cooking dinner for us, but since my FIL has a heart issue everything is no fat, no salt and she basically cooks the things that she has always cooked (meat and potato dishes) only using fat free and no sodium ingredients, which of course is horrible. 

I'm in IT, I make good money, there is no issue with our finances overall. I take for granted that I have a 250mbit Internet connection at home. My inlaws barely have Internet, they have the lowest end 1.0mbit connection that is essentially free from their tv provider. My MIL uses it to check email, that is it. At their Cape Cod house, no Internet, no cable, and barely any cell service either. If I was going camping in Yellowstone I wouldn't care about Internet, but I'm stuck in a small house with old people that are done trying new things.

Interacted with a woman today who needed some basic tech help. When I first noticed her, she had two children under 4 with her and was trying really hard to keep them calm. They were yelling, running around, basically acting like kids in a quiet computer lab. I didn't give her any shit about it because she looked really stressed out.

It LOOKED like the baby would have a really hard time breathing, but I'm not an expert at all. Basically its face was pressing up against the front of the backpack, and then had a blanket on top of that. 

I asked ""is he ok like that?"" and the woman just smiled and nodded. I did not ask any follow up questions. 

AITA? Was that a safety thing? I'm new to this job and there were employees senior to me that interacted with this woman and didn't mention it, but the baby was really hard to see in the carrier. I'm also not 100% convinced English was this woman's first language, she seemed to have trouble understanding basic things I said.

"AITA for not liking the engagement ring?. Well this is my very first reddit post and I’m on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues. 

My boyfriend(23m) and I(23f) have been together for seven months now. We both know we are meant to be with each other and we both know we are going to get married one day. He’s my best friend and a truly wonderful and kind man. 

Well last night we got on the topic of engagement rings. I know I can be picky when it comes to jewelry and I think that if I want something specific then I should communicate that. So I told him that I like 3 stone rings in a simple classic setting, round or oval cut, and jokingly said, “and if the stone ain’t a carat, i don’t want it.” 100% joking with him. I also mentioned I really don’t like marquise cut diamond rings. I don’t care about brands and I like getting the most bang for my buck so I told him if he wants to get it from a pawn shop or used or whatever is most financially feasible then that’s fine with me. I just want a certain style and quality. Then I remembered that his grandmother had offered to let him pick one of her extra rings for me (so sweet) when he’s ready to propose. So I told him I think he should take advantage of a free diamond ring and take her up on the offer.

Now the engagement ring that she wears is a massive marquise cut rock set in a pretty typical 70’s retro setting. It’s not my style at all. So I told him that he should just pick the ring with the largest diamond and if I didn’t like the cut or setting we could always have that redone because it’s cheaper than buying a new diamond ring. 

Well he got very offended. Lo and behold he clarified that his grandmother had actually offered him one specific ring, not a choice of multiple rings, and guess what...it’s a 3 stone marquise...and i just told him I don’t like marquise diamonds. He felt like I had, “shit all over the ring” but I didn’t mean to! He said I was acting ungrateful because his grandmother is offering us a gift and that he understands there’s a “social status” component to engagement rings but essentially I’m acting like anything less than what I want is unacceptable. 

I really tried to broach the subject with clear communication. If he proposed to me with nothing but a flower I would say yes in a heartbeat. Marriage isn’t about the ring and I could give a shit about any social status crap. I would just like the ring I’m going to wear for literally the rest of my life to be something I like and I feel like I should be able to tell him what my style is. The fact that I accidentally insulted the ring his grandmother offered was a big oops but what if I don’t like it? Am I supposed to pretend that I like it because it’s a gift from her?

Like I said, I love him so much and I feel bad that I hurt his feelings. If I am genuinely in the wrong then I want to make amends and learn from it. So I’m asking y’all, am I the asshole? 

","NAH I think it's a matter of apologizing and explain that having a ring you're comfortable wearing and enjoy will only bring good luck and happiness to the marriage. Where as wearing a ring that isnt your taste everyday will feel less like something that belongs as a part of your union. 

Bottom line apologize for insulting the ring, but tell him you're the one who will be wearing it day in and day out. Not him or his grandmother. ",0,0,0,1,0

Someone just asked me who it was” so then I basically dropped everything and I told her I liked her and told her I only mentioned it to my friend.

"WIBTA if I told my MIL to stop teaching our daughter to say ""blessing""?. Let me start this by saying that yes, I am an atheist, and no I am not an aggressive dick about. Believe what you want on your terms, just respect others rights.

My(31m) wife (30f) and I have our one child (3f), and we have made the decision to raise her secularly. I was brought up Catholic, my wife Baptist but we have both  in our lives decided that it didnt work for us. We have also discussed the harm, and general ""ickyness"" there is in forcing religious rituals at a young age and that indoctrination that young is inappropriate.

Our problem is that while we have stated this to my in-laws, they always looked shocked and say they would never go against our wishes (well before we have accused them of anything). When our daughter come home from an overnight there, or we go over and have breakfast, she (my daughter) will tell us we have to wait and say blessing, cross her hands and then say amen.

When we are at home we correct her, tell her that we don't do that and she stops and doesn't do it again until after a visit there. When we are at their house, if they are saying blessing we remind our daughter to stay quiet and be respectful, but don't let her cross her hands, but if that's going to be too obvious I usually stand there quietly, my wife gives me the look of ""oh shit he is going to say something"" and we discuss it later.


I'm at a point where I am tired of it. This is behavior that is taught, and they are obviously teaching it to her. My family is religious, she can stay there and never comes back doing that because they respect our decisions. So, WIBTA?

You should be careful that you don't impose your ideology the same way you fear your religious parents are.

"AITA for calling out a family friend for using inhumane mouse traps?. So one of our family friends (who I'll call Maria) invited us to her house for lunch last year. At one point during our conversation, Maria mentioned that she used glue traps to get rid of mice in her house. For those unaware, glue traps are considered very inhumane. In most cases, the trapped animal can't escape and will eventually starve or die of dehydration. Although you can release rodents from glue traps using vegetable oil, most people don't do this.

I asked Maria whether she would release the mice elsewhere or dispatch them, and she said that she just threw them in the trash. I told her that glue traps are very cruel and asked her how she would like if it someone left her stranded in a desert with no water, to which she couldn't come up with a response.

"AITA for pressuring my girlfriend to break off her friendship with her bestfriend cause he bullied me and forced me to a different school?. Tdlr at the bottom.


So me and my girlfriend have been going steady for about 2 months now. I told her about how I was forced to go a different school because of a kid who we will call M. She told me that M was her best friend and that he would never do that. Well I'm a 17 year old mtf transgender person who has Asperger's and have been bullied since 8th grade for being openly gay and trans. Once he found out he started bullying me.

8th grade year I came out as gay and was writing a list of people who are and aren't supportive. I was in the middle of writing the people who weren't when a kid looked over saw his name and asked me if it was a hit list. So long story short he went around saying I was going to shoot up the school it followed me all the way to last year and through 3 schools. 

So we were nearing the end of the school year and it's the second to last day. He said I was the reason for a stay in place that happened a few days ago. I said I wasn't we started pushing and shoving each other. Principal came and broke it up. He got suspended and my day went as normal. At around 6:30 that night police showed up at my door to inform me that I was not to go to school because I was a threat. Long story short he told one of his friends to send out a mass text saying I was gonna bomb the school. So I got told to stay home because I was a security risk to the school.

So I told my GF all about this and she said that she knows him and that he would never hurt a fly and that I'm a asshole because I'm blaming him for a problem I started. So Reddit Am I the asshole.

"AITA for not wanting to go to vegas on my 21st bday. On thanksgiving I was told that my mom and sisters are planning on saving up and sending me to vegas in August for my 21st birthday. I absolutely love the sentiment and that they thought of doing something like this for me without me asking. It really does make me feel loved.

But it's far from anything I'd want to do for multiple reasons. 

I'm not sure why, but since I was a teenager I've hated my birthday. I've never had a bad birthday or had anything awful happen, but I still insist on not celebrating. Something about everyone I know giving me special attention for a day just makes me feel bad, especially since my family helps each other all the time which more than makes up for any birthday gifts. Every year I tell them i just want to act like its another week day and go on about our business, and I'm strongly ignored and told its not a possibility.

I also really strongly dislike cities and crowds of people. I've been to NYC on a choir trip, as well as London, and I just didnt like how many people were everywhere I went. It gave me a different sensation of anxiety than I've felt before and I know vegas would be the same thing.

My brother in law was the one who told me, and when I expressed this he just told me they're doing it because they love me, and I should accept it because I could end up regretting having a shitty 21st birthday. Which I can see the reason, in but I've never in my whole life wanted to go to Las Vegas or expressed it to any of them.

My girlfriend also said I should take the opportunity because it's a once in a lifetime thing to have other people pay for your trip to Vegas and they just want me to have a good birthday, so I really dont know what I should do here.

Part of me wants to tell them no because it isnt something I'm interested in, and part of me wants to let them go ahead with the plan because they're doing it out of love and I resist so much every year, but all of me knows theres going to be some regret in whatever choice I make. I don't want to say no and have them feel bad and I dont want to say yes just to go down there and not have a good time, wasting their money on the whole trip.

I also know the whole trip would be very expensive. From the plane ticket, hotel room, drinks, food, and anything else it would be at least $1000 and it just makes me feel absolutely awful to have them pay for that for me.

Your disappointment is real and valid. It’s hard to understand sometimes why parents made the decisions they made, and it’s easy to focus on their mistakes because they have real, even drastic, consequences for you. Your parents let you down in a way that you’re just beginning to process. Imagining how much easier things might have been if you had a heads up or someone to talk to about what you’re going through or resources for people who deal with what you do- that’s inevitable. But now you have the power of knowledge on your side- it’s never too late to start to get better or to learn to cope. Give yourself time to process all of this- you might be thinking back over and over again to things that happened in childhood that might’ve tipped you or your parents off. Things start to click.

You’re not wrong for feeling this way, and you probably need space right now. But your parents likely love you very much and were just doing what they hoped/thought was best for you at the time. Clearly they were wrong (at least some of the time) and it hurts because you wish things were different.

"AITA For leaving our daughter without money or anywhere to live?. Hi all,

Our daughter just graduated from University with a degree in art.

When it came time for her to apply to University we told her that we won't pay for tuition if she studies something that doesn't have a good rate of return. She borrowed around $150k (NZD) of student loans to do her art degree and now she has a job that pays significantly less than the average wage doing some casual painting for small studios and her overall prospects don't look good - almost 100% of her paycheque goes on a rented apartment that she shares with two other people.

We haven't told her, but we're going to pay off her student loan debt this year so she can be debt free.

We (parents) want to sell our house and leave the country, we're looking at moving from New Zealand to Europe so we can enjoy skiing in the winter and french vineyards in the summer. We're in our 50's now so we feel like we've earned the right to start enjoying our lives rather than continuing to live in the city.

Our daughter recently asked if she could move back in with us in order to reduce her living expenses, we told her that we are planning on moving to Europe. She suggested that we let her stay in our house after we leave; we really need to sell the house as we need the money. She is incredibly angry at us for ""abandoning"" her. We feel that as a 22 year old adult, she should be able to take care of herself, we gave her access to the best private schools in the area, the best after school tutors and her grades were A's across all subjects. She chose to live the life of a suffering and poor artist despite us trying to get her interested in medicine, law, business etc. We tried not to push her too hard towards things that she had no interest in but we really did try to show her that art isn't going to let her live the kind of life that she became accustomed to when she lived with us (ski trips, nice houses, restaurants etc).

Then she asked when we could start booking cause now she was able to cover the ticket to Vietnam and back, I told her to wait because I don’t know with certainty if my thesis will be in in time for the first exam period, if I fail I can’t travel. So I asked her again to come here so that even if I’d fail we could be together but she full on refuses and it pissed me off as I feel like she doesn’t try to understand how big of a deal the graduation is for me.

Now it’s been in my mind for days and I feel like an ass for getting mad over something like this, but can’t seem to get over how she does not want to be at one of the greatest times of my life,

"AITA for not wanting to attend my mother's wedding?. This one comes with a story.

I grew up with an awesome Dad. Here, i'll be using my dead nickname, Maddie. He loved me regardless of anything, when i told him i was gay (age 10, i just knew...) He told me he, and my mother, were Bisexual. He had diabetes and he got a wound on his foot two or three years ago. His foot couldn't heal and got infected. His infection spread to his blood and then, to his brain. His last words two me before he passed (February 16th, 2018), were ""Don't worry about me Maddie. I love you no matter what.""

Two months after he passed away, my mom took a try at dating and ended up with my soon-to-be Stepmom. I like her stepmom, but i go into a panic whenever i think about attending their wedding. My Stepmom adores me and wants me to be there, but i'm avoiding the topic of the wedding regardless.

i will still be attending, regardless, as i am supposed to help plan, but i want to know... AITA for wanting to not attend my mother's wedding?

"AITA for not putting in a good word for my girlfriend when she applied to my company. My girlfriend recently was laid off from her job and has been looking for a new one. She saw an opening at my company and said she was going to apply. It’s in a different department so we wouldn’t really interact much, so I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal. 

She asked me to put in a good word for her. I have nothing to do with hiring in general, but she’s not even applying for a job related to mine.

She’s still mad, AITA?","I saw NAH, but only because I don't think either of you sees the other one's point.

Your girlfriend doesn't understand that to you, your testimony wouldn't be of value to the hiring department because you believe that all they would hear is ""I'm dating this person and therefore I think they're great"".

You don't understand that not everyone thinks their SO is a great worker, so if you could actually speak to how she works/any examples of work ethic that you've seen from her, it would say a lot to a hiring manager.

"AITA for not going with my mother to church?. For context, I'm twenty and have only just recently moved back to the same state as my parents.

When I was still in high-school, I told both of my parents that I no longer shared their religious beliefs. I have no problem with those that have faith, I just don't want any part of it myself (I'm somewhere between an atheist and agnostic, strongly leaning towards the former, they're catholics).

Both my parents have been divorced for over ten years; my father was reluctant at first, but nowadays doesn't seem to have any issue on it. My mother, however, doesn't ever seem like she wants to let it go.

Now, I don't want this to sound like she's a bad person or anything- I love her to death. She's one of the most loving, generous, and kind-hearted people I know, and she practically raised me and my sister alone. She has no outstanding faults other than this one issue; she refuses to accept that I'm an atheist.

One of the things she asks from me is to go to church with her every year. I stopped going years ago, but I've indulged her ever since with going on Christmas and occasionally Easter. I figured that an hour or two of my time isn't that much to ask for.

But we just had another discussion about it, and I told her politely but firmly that I would not be going to Easter mass this year. She was hurt, and long-story-short, both of us walked away from that talk upset. The thing is, I sense that if I keep placating her with these trips to mass, she'll never see that I truly feel uncomfortable with attending.

Whenever we have talks about religion, I feel like she doesn't truly respect my beliefs. I make sure not to watch my language in front of her, no 'oh my god's, or 'jesus' kind of speech that would be offensive to her- but she's always maintained that she hopes I come back to the church, that I'm ""still young"" and this is just a ""phase"" that I'll eventually tire of. Is it so much for me to ask that she respect my own beliefs and stop asking me to rejoin the church?

**TL;DR** My catholic mom wants my atheist butt to go with her to church, don't know if it's disrespectful or not to my own beliefs

"AITA for getting drunk and waking up in the hospital. So I’ve been on Reddit for awhile but have always lurked, let me know if I should change the formatting etc...

I’m a 22 year old college transfer currently living on campus in an apartment with 3 roommates who are all partiers. I’m not a party guys I’m a quiet reserved stay at home type of person. I never drink not even socially, I’ve never been drunk. 

My girlfriend and I both transferred to this school a few weeks ago so besides her I don’t know anyone. We’ve been dating for two years and I love this girl. Like every relationships we have our ups and our downs but she is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.

This happened on Saturday my girlfriend and I walked into the city and had a date night, I drank one beer and then we Ubered back to campus, my roommates are heavy drinkers and partiers. Her and I walk into the kitchen/living room to find my 3 roommates and 2 of their friends all drinking playing this drinking game, I want to play to seem like I can hang with the boys while my girlfriend sits and watches. A few rounds go by and in less than 10 minutes I’m up to 3 beers on the night. My girlfriend wants to go so I walk her home. She says that I told her I was done drinking for the night however I don’t remember saying that (at this point I was buzzed and may have said that to assure her) I walk back and continue to play after being persuaded by my roommates. 6 beers, I’m done playing I’ve had enough, my roommate bets me $10 to take a shot, like I said I want to fit in with my roommates so I do it, I play a game of NHL then my roommate says $10 to do another shot. 

At this point I’m fucked but having fun I can remember everything up until this moment. I take the shot I sit down. Next thing I know I’m dreaming, I’m throwing up more than I ever have before, I can feel it the taste of it in my mouth but I can’t see or move, then I wake up. I’m in the hospital my parents are there. I wouldn’t call them upset but they’re relieved I’m okay, I walk out of the hospital after about 30 minutes of being awake. 

The next day my girlfriend is livid. She is so upset by the fact that this had happened and is basically making me feel like she’s questioning our relationship. She’s making me feel so bad for something I never meant to happen that hasn’t happened before and definitely will never happen again. For so many reasons that night was the worst of my life.

"AITA for ""not supporting my girlfriend""?. My GF and I were on a public transit train where the seats in front of us faced us.  A couple about our age, mid to late twenties, sat down across from us.  The man across from us coughed a couple times and the first cough he didn't cover his face immediately but turned his head as to not cough towards our direction.  A couple seconds later my girlfriend pulls her shirt up over her face and holds it there. With a bit of an angry look.  I felt embarrassment that she did this and I asked what she is doing.  I was embarrassed cuz the couple is facing directly at us and it seemed like a rude thing to do.  She said she was trying to prevent getting sick.  I made the comment ""will that really prevent you from getting sick?"", and she got really upset with me.  Saying I don't support her and that it would help and I don't know more about her regarding medical issues.  She went to school for pre-med.  It turned into a big argument where we sat in silence for the next half hour.

"AITA for cutting ties with my friend for feeling like he used me?. This happened last year, in December, but I haven't stopped questioning my decision since it happened. I had been friends with this guy for about 4 years. We met in high school and had been close ever since. He moved about 5 hrs away to go to university where I stayed in our town to do community college. At the start of winter break, he hit me up saying he didn't have a ride back from university, so I told him that I'd be happy to pick him up, I hadn't seen him in months, he'd just have to reimburse me for the gas. So I drive to pick him up, a total of 10 hrs there and back.

He was home for 2 weeks and didn't hit me up ONCE. His excuse was ""I'm busy with my family"". The thing is, his family fucking loves me. His mom calls me her son, I'm basically extended family to them. Hell I'm sure they would have let me stay with them for Christmas (I was home alone for Christmas because my family was out of the state). Half the time I texted him to hang out he'd say he was with his girlfriend. I just feel like he could have taken at least one of those days he spent with his girlfriend just to come see me for at least an hour. Or he could have invited me to come see him and his family, but he didn't reach out. Didn't even call on Christmas. So I told him he was fake and a shit friend and he said I was tripping, that he was just busy with his family and I should let it go. I told him to fuck off and then blocked him. Recently I heard from one of my friends who spoke to him that he's telling people that I overreacted. Am I the asshole?

Edit: To clarify some things I left out, we talked about hanging out on the way back he said he would hit me up, he just never followed through. A lot of people have been mentioning that I shouldn't have blown up on him, which I guess is true, I was just so upset that I let my anger get the best of me. Last summer he fucked my gf and I didn't find out until I left her, but I forgave him because of how close I considered him. So all of that really added to how I reacted","NAH.

"AITA for joking about a subreddit's imminent brigading?. This happened back during the Super Bowl ""Sweet Victory"" controversy, so I waited a while before posting so people's heads could cool down and I could get an unbiased answer.

&#x200B;

Basically, Maroon 5 teased that they would play play ""Sweet Victory"" during the half time show in honor of Stephen Hillenburg. That turned out to be a lie. r/BikiniBottomTwitter was pretty pissed off about it, with everyone posting memes about their disappointment, but it was all rather humorous and generally fun. That's why I'm on that sub in the first place, I don't care much for Spongebob, but it's funny. Well, I saw a comment saying something to the effect of ""I bet the Marroon 5 subreddit is going to get a lot of shit for this."" I thought, ""You know, they probably are. I wonder what's happening there?""

&#x200B;

So I check out r/Maroon5, and it's just this tiny 750ish subscriber dead fansub. However, there were two posts already on it from Spongebob fans. One of them was an angry troll saying ""fuck maroon 5,"" but the other one was a humorous picture of the Pitchfork Salesman from... whichever episode of Spongebob featured a pitchfork salesman.

&#x200B;

Now, what I expected was mostly posts of the latter sort: teasing, but ultimately good natured meme posts. I decided to post one like it in the name of fake internet points. It said ""Don't mind me, I'm just here to watch Spongebob fans burn this place to the ground."" My post was third out of what turned out to be hundreds, and I got like 2000 upvotes. However, the ensuing shitstorm was NOT the jokes I was expecting, but mostly variants on ""fuck maroon 5."" It was uuuuuuugly.

&#x200B;

So my moral quandary is this: was I part of the problem, and if so, how much? I got there before the brigade really became a ""brigade,"" but my post certainly could be viewed as actual encouragement to ""burn this place to the ground,"" and really I knew that it was always possible that people would get mean.","NAH, and because you posted early your meme was probably viewed a lot.

"AITA for telling my son that I don't want him using a racial slur?. My wife and I have been together for 12 years. She has a 15 year old son from a previous relationship and we have two biological kids together. My wife is black and I am white. My stepson's bio dad is black. My stepson does not see his bio father and hasn't since he was 5. 

My stepson has taken to using the n-word with his friends. Most of his school is white but he uses this word even with all of his friends regardless of race. Today we were watching a football game together and he said, ""Get up n---a!"" I told him that I can't control what language he uses outside the home but can control what language he uses here. My wife and I have eased up on caring about swearing. We know he's going to curse and taught him time and place instead of an outright ban and he curses around us sometimes. Our rule is that you don't curse at other people. So saying ""Son of a bitch"" after you drop something is okay but calling your brother a ""son of a bitch"" is not. He said that calling someone the n-word isn't the same thing as cursing at them. He says it's no different than a girl playfully calling herself or a friend ""a bitch."" I told him that I don't care. I don't want that word used in our home. He told me I can't tell him not to say that word since I'm not black.

"AITA because I deleted some bad photos of myself from my dads phone.. So as the title states I deleted 4 selfies from my dads phone. I was having dinner with my grandparents and dad, he was telling us about how he showed some people at work photos of me, and as I am a somewhat insecure teenage girl I asked to see them. They were terrible, someone else may not agree but I was quite embarrassed that he'd been showing these to men and children that I didn't know. Especially because they were private photos that I assume I'd taken on his phone. So I deleted them (knowing he could easily get them back). If they'd been photos from my own social media I would've been fine with it as I am happy with ones I post.

He got very angry and started shouting that I had no right to do that. I said he could get them back and I had hundreds of different ones I could send. He raised his voice again and said they were photos of his daughter!! Over and over. He stormed off and loudly announced to my nan (knowing I could hear) that I was insecure and just because they weren't up to my 'ridiculous' standard didn't mean I could delete them. He even brought up his deceased brother? Saying that he didn't have enough photos of him, I'm unsure how this relates to me. He continued but shut the door so I couldn't hear.

He left soon after, and my nan told me to get the photos back, I said no and that he was being childish when he knows I have plenty I'd let him use. I have since caved in and sent two of the four back.

"WIBTA if I want to end friendship after 4 years?. So I (35,M) met K(25,F) 4 years ago,at an event related to  common fitness interest. Since then,we organise our fitness sessions on and off, but it was pretty regular during last year,at least once a week. During these years, I’ve regularly supported her about her fitness skills and she has alway been very nice with me. She has some special professional skills (earning waaay more $$$ than me) that I have used couple of times and she has been very generous about discounts,without me ever asking for it. 

Here’s where the issue starts. What started as an acquaintance has remained almost still an acquaintance,after so many years. I’ve invited her couple of times at my place and she knows everyone in my family,and goes well with them, but she rarely talks about her own life with me or anyone else in my family . We were friends on Facebook but now I don’t see her posts, while I know that she’s still actively using Facebook. She used to refer her boyfriend as “somebody” until the day I met him. Many times,after our fitness session,we go for some food/drinks together and the talks  over food are not much interesting or informative. Moreover,if her boyfriend is coming to pick her up, she’d make sure that I leave before he arrives. (Before you think she may be in tough relationship,let me assure you that it is not the case. She’s not the kind of person who will take any nonsense from anyone.) Apart from this,when I look back, I have only 2 contact points with her, fitness sessions or her professional help, and that’s it. Overall, I always get the mixed signals.

"AITA for getting frustrated with my friend who dropped out?. So, a while ago, my really good friend dropped out of school. While I didn't necessarily think it was a good idea by any means at the time, I didn't want him to think I didn't support him no matter what so I tried to be good about it. He told me it's because he doesn't think he needs school and is burnt out. I think a lot of it has to do with depression, among other things.

"AITA for talking to my manager about my position I just got hired on, which resulted my manager getting upset about it?. I will explain with as much detail as possible on what happened a few days ago and I do not know if I should feel bad.

I got hired as a delivery driver at a pizza restaurant. I used to work for those Courier companies, like GrubHub, Uber Eats, etc for over a year. I also do smaller deliveries from another restaurant for a few months. Based on the experience of me delivering, I was expecting everything to be good when I got hired and the training. The manager basically told me I will start training the same day in the evenings. So for the first day, I was driving with other drivers so I can understand how they operate everything. Everything went good. The driver also told me that I will be doing small things, such as washing dishes and folding boxes. 

Honestly, it was not a big deal for me. Because I was raised hand washing dishes and I used to work at another restaurant a while back washing dishes too, so I have no issues with it.

The 2nd day, I was expecting to start driving, but for some resson, the manager kept saying to drive with the other drivers. Since it was a Friday, it was so busy, so I was riding with one of the drivers the entire time. Later on, I was told to help roll up some dough. That's what started to be concerned because I thought I was hired for something else, but I was doing other things unrelated to it. 

After everything calmed down and my shift ended. I went to talk to her about what was going on. She told me that I won't be delivering for the location I am at, but at another location near me that was opening up soon. I was aware about the transfer since the first day, but I was not aware about me not doing any deliveries at all the first day. She somehow started to get upset to me about it, which I didn't understand why.

She then explained to me that since there were enough drivers in the location, there is no need to have me as a driver now in the location. I now understand everything. I then told her I should have known about this when I got hired.   She then started to ask if I still want to do this.  I said yes. I apologized to her about mentioning all of this to her.  She said it was fine, but she still looked a little upset.  

I didn't mind doing other stuff at all, but because I got hired at other restaurants as a delivery driver, I didn't know it will be totally different because of my last experiences. I honestly now regret talking to her because I'm concerned I lost my reputation towards the restaurant and the manager won't be the same to me again. I hope that won't be like that when I clock in later tonight.

I leaned over and told him, paraphrasing of course: ""If you don't put your seatbelt on right and sit straight up, if we get into a car accident, you are going to fly forward and hit the back of your dad's seat at 70 miles per hour. He'll be crushed. You'll both be ground to paste against the asphalt and they'll have to hose you off the road.""

My mom is upset about this. My brother pretty much ignored me and my step father doesn't care, but mom is pissed off and yelled at me not to talk like that to my brother. So AITA?","NAH

"AITA for telling my parents about my sister’s eating habits?. This summer, I started to notice that my sister’s eating habits were out of wack. I never saw her eating breakfast, understandable for days she’d sleep in until noon, but even on the days she had dance in the morning, she’d maybe grab an apple before, but eat only a bite and then throw the rest away. 

For lunch, she’d sometimes nibble on something, but not much, and when I asked her about it, she got mad and said that she doesn’t need as much food as me and my brother since she’s a girl. 

And then at dinner, she’d always tell my parents that she wasn’t hungry, that she ate a lot that day, and at first, I thought maybe she was eating snacks and stuff without me seeing, but soon it was obvious that she was lying. She lost some weight, which I thought was from her dancing so much, but I’m not sure.

I told my parents what I had been seeing, and now, they have her in therapy for an eating disorder, but the worst part (for her at least) is that they pulled her out of dance. She is very upset about that, and she knows that I said something, and I feel awful that I caused her to get pulled out of dance. She’s miserable without it and I hate seeing it. Things seem to have been going fine for her, I don’t know if my parents are overreacting, but I feel like everything got turned upside down and I’m the asshole for saying anything to begin with.","NAH. I feel like you did the responsible thing by telling them because I don't know your guys' ages, but it seems you're still in your teens and this may very well be something that needs to be treated by a professional. Much better this way than her hurting herself. She'll probably get to go to dance later on again.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA if I wanted to upgrade the gift my girlfriend got me for Christmas?. My girlfriend and I work in an industry where we have to work during the holidays. So we celebrated Christmas a bit early and exchanged gifts this weekend. My girlfriend got me a smart watch which I was going to buy for myself. The problem was that I was going to get an upgraded version of it. I use my watch to track my steps while going for runs and the watch I wanted could play music without a smartphone. The one she got me did not have that feature.  It is an additional 20 dollar from the cost of the watch that she got me to get this additional feature.

"AITA for wanting to give my child a name chosen for a questionable reason?. I'm pregnant. The circumstances around the father are bad. He won't be at all involved going forward. I do not know the gender yet.

I have a favourite name. Changing the ending can make it for boys or girls. It's not a bad name in the sense that my child would get bullied or anything, and both the boy and girl versions are fairly popular. Definitely not the most common but a few years from now they could easily end up in class with another kid with this name. However, the name means ""something good from something bad"". I fell in love with the name as soon as I read that, because that's how I view this child, as something good from something bad.

Today I told my family the name(s) I was considering and they said it was lovely and genuinely nice name. They asked why I chose it. I told them about the meaning and they said that was ""horrible"" and asked what I would say if my child ever asked about their name. I said I would tell them the literal meaning of the name at the time and the why I chose it would come when they were older. (EDIT: I would definitely lean more heavily on the ""something good"" aspect, less on the ""something bad"" part, but I am aware that they will need to be told the full story eventually)

My family responded that it was my choice but out of the 4 of them (mum, dad, brother, sister) 3 of them felt that the whole decision was really messed up, not because the name is bad, but because of my reasoning for choosing it. The only person on my side was my sister.

75% of my family are really strongly against it and they're basically my only support system so I am majorly second guessing myself.

AITA for wanting to give my child this name because of the circumstances surrounding their father?","nta,

My parents knowingly named me something that meant ""father's joy"" because they thought it was funny. They are lesbians.

"AITA for getting annoyed with my girlfriend for her constantly complaining that we dont see each other enough?. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about three years, and have met in college. We both have recently graduated and are back living at home with our parents which live about an hour and a half away from eachother.  Since graduation we havent been able to see eachother as much as we had when we were still in school. We get to see each other roughly about once a week. Sometimes twice a week, sometimes once every two weeks. 

My girlfriend currently has a job from 8 - 4:30 every weekday and I am currently waiting to start my job in early December. Since I have alot of time off, I have made many plans with friends to do things and even though I havent started working yet I am busy on weekends and so is my girlfriend.  Now the issue comes when we are trying to plan time together, it always feels as though I am the one having to make the drive to her place, never the other way around yet she is constantly letting me know that we barely get to see eachother. Since I dont have a job, driving a combined 3 hours everytime I want to see her starts to add up in cost, and with no current income, its a bit tough to continue to do this.  Her reasoning that she cant come see me is that after work she wouldnt be able to see me for long enough to make it worth it. 

If I am in the area already I will stop by on the way home at her place for a few hours to hang out. But even when I do this and she isnt expecting me to come and I surprise her, it still isnt long enough.

Am I an asshole for getting annoyed with her and not driving out to see her more?","I am going to impart some wisdom that it took me decades to realize:

&#x200B;

She loves you, misses you, and understands the reasons why you can't see her as much. She is communicating that she loves you and misses you. But you are interpreting it as she wants you to do more.  


The reality is you just have to agree with her, tell her you love her and miss her, and wish you could see each other more. Just acknowledge and validate her feelings. The complaining won't stop, but the way she reacts to you will be positive. ",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for telling a friend how I felt about her, knowing she didn't feel the same. I met a girl on Tinder a couples of months ago, and after a while we had a date. We had a lot of fun and we connected instantly, but she wasn't interested in anything romantic. No big deal, we kept it to friendship (with sometimes things getting a little more physical, but rarely). We've gotten really close since, we text everyday, we see eachother as much as possible, we've talked about a lot of really personnal stuff. I tought I did a good job of moving on, that I wasn't interested in her that way anymore. Then, a couple of days ago I spent the night at her place. We drank a lot and it was getting late, so she offered me to stay to sleep, it's closer to my job anyway. We didn't have sex or anything, but we cuddled a lot, even though she's usually not a cuddler. The day after I had a hard time leaving, I've never felt so good in my life. That's when I realised that I was lying to myself, my feelings for her are clearly more than just friendship. I wrote her a message telling her that, not because I was hopping that she would reciprocate, but mostly because I felt she should know. I felt like the cuddling may not have happened if she was aware of how I feel, and that I should be honest with her. Her response to it so far was ""I don't know what to tell you. I don't really want to think about it. At least, not right now"". That was bad timing on my part, she was getting ready to go to work and still tired from the night before. During our first conversation about a potential relationship, I told her that I would be honest if I've ever felt that way, and so I did. However, she also said that she feared to hurt me, she doesn't want me to feel bad because it's not gonna go further than that, so I kinda feel like an asshole for putting her in that situation. On the other hand, I would have felt like an even bigger asshole if I didn't say anything and continued to cuddle and potentially more. At least now if it happens, she'll know that it means more to me, not that I really expect it to happens. It's just that I don't know what she's thinking right now, and I worry it might have been an asshole move on my part that could hurt our friendship, which is the last thing  I want.

"AITA for telling my best friend to break up with his GF of 6 years?. I've been best friends with somebody, we'll call him E, online for about 4 years. He has an online GF, R, who he has met IRL probably once a year that he has been dating since high school.

Me and E are best friends. Like, legit. E also knows I have pretty much had a lowkey crush on him the entire time I have known him. It's NBD; I'm in a lovely relationship ATM and never pressured him into being with me. We playfully flirt often in a friend way but both understand we are each in a relationship.

Yesterday, I told him he needed to break up with R. He is about to finish college and move across the country to live with her. I am 99% sure she is emotionally abusive.

I typed that out, with reasonings to this conclusion (tldr; guilt trips, victimizes herself constantly, expects his time on a whim, makes him walk on eggshells, etc), apologies for saying it so bluntly, and empathizing a lot, as I have been in a handful of abusive relationships.

I know he would not be safe or happy living with her and this is only his second relationship ever. But - he knows I am and always will be kinda into him. I hesitated to say anything but he implied last night he was going to propose to her. I genuinely fear for his well being - and I have tried telling him this just short of literally BREAK UP WITH HER.

&#x200B;

I have lived in a small country town (<2000 people) for my whole life. When I was around 7 years old my parents divorced and my mother moved away to a small city 7(ish) hours drive from my home town. Well since then both my brother and sister have moved to a city for university thats about 4 hours from my home town, and now my mother is moving to a city thats halfway between my home town and the city my siblings live in. Basically, I'm considering moving with my mum for the following reasons:

&#x200B;

\-Education: I'm a very STEM-oriented kid, I'm doing Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematical Methods (2nd hardest maths course for Australian secondary education), and English (because it's compulsory); basically a bunch of difficult shit.  The high school in my home town basically can't run a class for physics and maths methods because of a lack of students, whereas the high schools in the city my mum is moving to obviously can. 

&#x200B;

\-Sick of my home town: That's basically it, I'm sick of living in a small town where there's nothing to do and everyone knows everyone. 

&#x200B;

The things that are keeping me in my home town on the other hand are:

&#x200B;

\-Already established: Moving to a new city means that I have to find new friends and settle into a new life, which im worried will be difficult to do along with year 12.

&#x200B;

\-Worried about my dad: For reasons I'd rather not list here, I'm worried that if I leave him on his own he'll succumb to urges a bit too much.

&#x200B;

\-Friends: I've already got friends here, I like them.

\-Cat: My cat lives here at my dad's house, I really like my cat.

"AITA if I’m still mad at my landlords for a fee I incurred after they withdrew it?. I stay in a fairly standard apartment complex with fairly standard management. Everything is okay except I don’t really like living here and the rent is probably gonna jump in price this summer.

Basically, there’s a 50$ fee if they catch you leaving trash out. So I share the apartment with my mother-in-law and husband.

They are both from another country and I was born here in US. Mother-in-law has somewhat heavy accent and whenever she goes to the office she likes one of us to go, not because she can’t speak English well enough on her own, but because it’s easier and faster. I say this because it seemed to be a factor, considering what happened.

MIL received an email last week warning about dog droppings being left out and that they have spies looking for the poopetraters, which was fine, since we got the same email. Now, all three of us are on the lease for this apartment and my husband and I tend to be in communication with the office more often. However, one member of the staff (imma call her ‘K’) sent an email to my MIL only, saying that we’d left out trash and to please pay 50$ ASAP through the online system.

So that day she told us about it, wondering if we’d left out trash, but no one had. K sent the email right before the office closed and so there was nothing we could do to contest it at the time.

I was home the next day so I decided to go to the office and ask them about it, and get the fee removed. K was out showing an apartment but the property manager was there. (Her name is T)

I told T about the issue and she said she’d have to ask K because the person who sent the email out was supposed to have photographic proof. I sat down to wait for K to return. After a couple of minutes, T told me it would probably be a while and advised me to wait for an email. I gave her mine and my husbands (even though I know she had them already) and said to send us the photos if they wanted us to pay their fee. (I don’t think this was rude, I think it was reasonable to ask)

By the end of the day we hadn’t received anything from them, not even an update to let us know it was being looked into. Then the next day, around lunch time I received an email from T.

‘We have removed the trash charge from your account. We apologize for the inconvenience.’

Nothing from K whatsoever. I get that it’s mgmt job to back up their staff even when they make a mistake but the mistake isn’t even being acknowledged here. My husband said they took the fee off and apologized so I should let it go  but I can’t help but feel like my family is being discriminated against and taken advantage of..

I texted her later on asking her to stop doing so because it’s annoying and unnecessary, despite the fact that I know it’s coming from a motherly place. I mentioned that I do eat adequate protein and that I’m pretty sure my diet is the most varied in our family. I also told her to imagine how it would feel if I did the same thing to her.

Her response was “our generation is weird” and that  “it’s unnecessary for me to be annoyed” and that she didn’t mean it. I didn’t even bother responding. I feel like she could of at least apologized. She can be such a stubborn person.

But I also feel like maybe I shouldn’t be so irked and short with her? I mean, it’s not like she says these things in a forceful manner. I just don’t think they’re comments you should say to someone, regardless if it’s family, because it can make you feel uncomfortable.

"AITA for calling my bf (M32) out on his gaming habits?. Throwaway account. And on mobile. My apologies.

So my bf and I have been dating for about 8 months now, and things are going pretty well. His new job, however, leaves him tired pretty much all the time. He works early mornings (3am-11am) on weekdays, and I work as a bartender on Thursday-Saturday nights. I'm also a college student, so hanging out on weekdays is not really possible. So trying to find time where we're not both stupidly tired is really hard. We've worked out at least that he's the least tired on Fri/Sat nights so he doesn't have to wake up the next morning. So whenever I have a night off, I go see him.

The problem is we don't go out. When I'm at his place, I mostly just watch him play games with his friends. If I bring my PC over, we can play together, but otherwise I need to just find/bring something to do. We have an old Wii that I normally suggest we can play games together on, but often he refuses and goes back to his Pc. We do watch Game of Thrones together, but that's normally a few episodes just before bed. 


Fast forward to last weekend. I was rostered on for the whole weekend, so I got someone to cover my Friday shift. I went over to my bf's place and...same deal. I watched him play with his friends. (I didn't bring my PC. Normally if I'm only over for one day I don't bother). It's pretty depressing to be sitting next to someone you love and think ""man I would rather be at a job I hate right now."" So I spoke up. I told him that I took time off work tonight to see him and that we should spend our time doing something together. 

He got really defensive. Told me that he didn't think I wanted to do anything 'special' and that he just wants to play games. Anyway, he (reluctantly) shuts off his game, we make dinner together, watch some GoT together and then go to bed.

On one hand I'm happy I finally told him that it bothers me, but on the other I completely understand his situation. With his job, he doesn't have a whole lot of time to play games and I'm wondering if I was too pushy. I should've just gone to work and not guilt trip him for something that he likes doing, right?

He kinda blew it off, but it grates on me to be called the same thing as a dog, much less a dog I don't like. 

I know it's stupid, but it really drives me up the wall. WIBTA if I made a serious conversation out of it?","NAH maybe I'm off base but I don't think you *really* care that your husband calls you and his dogs by the same generic pet name.

Not only that, but it's a valid and new reason to be able to vent your frustrations about the dogs.

It sucks, and your husband was really selfish to push this on you, even if you did say yes. But, being that you did, you need to find a way to live with it without it eating you up.

"AITA for Sleeping In My Childhood Home?. I’m sorry for the long post there are just a lot of variables!! Here’s the deal: my fiancé (24M) and I (22F) are high school sweethearts. What that means is because we share the same hometown, holidays are usually a frantic attempt to visit all 3 families  (my parents are divorced, but stayed in the same town for the kids).

My fiancé wants to spend all of Easter weekend staying at his parents house. Which we have never done before, because usually when his family does holidays they also invite both sets of grandparents up so his family needs the space.

We also haven’t stayed overnight because his mom and I don’t really get along. I went no contact with her for two years during college because of the way she treated my fiancé and spoke about me. (if you want that drama for context check my JUSTNOMIL posts). It has since gotten better and we can be in the same room and talk to each other. However, I’m still not at ease around her.

When my fiancé mentioned staying at his parents place I told him he could stay there if he wanted, but I didn’t want to and I was going to stay at my dad’s house. Not it like a passive aggressive way, just I didn’t want to sleep there and I have other options.

He asked why I insisted on staying at my dad’s and said that his parents “would think it’s weird”. I’m not staying the weekend with him. I explained it was for a few reasons:  

1. The room we would have to sleep in at his parents house is tiny, it’s hot because it’s right over the boiler and it shares walls with his parents. So basically if something goes down where I need to vent I would physically have to leave the house, we are talking zero privacy. 

2. His mom still makes me uneasy so I’m going to sleep like sh*t. We have to move the next weekend so I don’t want to start the work week running on an empty tank.

3. My dad has a king size bed in his BASEMENT, which doesn’t matter to most people but we both LOVEEEEE basement sleeping.

4. I want to spend extra time with my dad because he scheduled a trip to go visit my brother over our move. I’m fine with it, but it’s one of those dad things where he feels really bad about missing a chance to help.

He kind of made a face, but let it go. I’m going to Easter church with my fiancé’s family and I’m spending all of Sunday there so it’s not like I’m avoiding them.

However, I knew what my dad wanted through the tone and excitement in his voice when I named specific major i.e. if I mention MIS, my dad would talk about how my aunt has a masters in that or if I mention animation, my dad would say things like, “but what kind of work could you do with that?”

But I’m not blaming my parents at all for me not getting an art degree. In the end, it was my choice and I was a wuss for going for a degree people wouldn’t look down upon.

I feel throughout my years, I’ve heard all sorts of people tell me I won’t be successful until I die if I pursue art, how useless an art degree is since it’s all self study, or the whole starving artist thing. This kind of reinforcement solidified my decision to not pursue art.

However, I only worked 2 years and a half into my career since college. Long story short, I have had this nagging feeling in my gut that told me i wasn’t suppose to do this, but I kept ignoring it. While work wasn’t hard, I was miserable. Eventually, I threw myself into art while working a full time job and making sure I don’t neglect my household.

I could only do this for so long until I had one of the worst panic attacks ever in my life, the point where my arms went numb and stiff and I had to pull over into a parking lot. After that, my husband said he supports me in whatever I wanted to do as he sees my work ethic and that my art is actually decent. 

Before I could truly make a decision in quitting my full time job, I wanted to at least talk to my parents about it first. To my surprise, they were really supportive and my dad said he was really proud of me and knows how much I love art. But they also mentioned about my degree and how they spent money on it so that I would get a good paying job and stability.

And now I feel all sorts of bad. I feel like it was my fault that I wasn’t upfront with them and myself when choosing my major and now, all that money my parents invested into me is wasted. 

So tell me Reddit, AITA for wasting my parents’ money? Because I sure do feel like I am.","NAH. I think your situation is a pretty normal case among children of Asian immigrants.

You know that college is not a linear investment, nor does it presuppose a single life trajectory. Career changes happen all the time because we get something vastly different from what we expect while in school. You did your time struggling through a miserable job. Are you truly ready to have a miserable career just to fulfill a ""debt"" to your parents?

Having your parents' blessing in a situation like this is really special. I think that's something that's worth taking with gratitude rather than doubt and self-resentment. It takes a lot of courage to be doing what you're doing, and so I hope you'll believe in yourself and chase after what you love.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for not letting my SO help me cross the street?. I’m (24F) in a fairly new relationship with this guy, let’s call him M (23M); we’ve been together for about 3 months. He’s slightly more “traditional” in some ways; he likes to open doors for me, wants me to walk in front of him, etc. (this is relevant). 

We live in a huge city, and it’s extremely common for people to cross the street when the WALK sign is not lit if there are no cars coming, or even if there are cars but they are a block or more away.  I noticed recently that when we’re out together, whenever I try to cross the street like this-- even when other people are also crossing-- his reflex is to snatch my arm and pull me back, as if I were about to run in front of a car. At first, I found it kind of endearing, like “aw, he’s worried about my safety”, and chalked it up to his other “traditional” behaviors, but now I’ve started to dislike it; it startles me, is unnecessary and feels a little insulting, like he doesn’t trust me to handle myself.  I hadn’t said anything until last night because I still felt that his intentions were good.

Cut to last night. We were heading back home after drinking with friends. I was definitely drunk but not blacked out or sloppy; I wasn’t falling over or confused. I started to cross a street that had very slow traffic, but I was not near a car and there were lots of other people crossing. He grabbed me and pulled me back as he usually does, and at that moment, it pissed me off. I didn’t say anything, but I yanked my arm back and continued crossing without him. 

Once we were alone, we got into an argument about it; me giving him attitude by pulling away really hurt him. He said that he was just trying to look out for my safety, it wasn’t just because I was girl and he would have done that with any of his friends, and he thought I was going to run in front of a car because I was drunk. He was mad enough that he said didn’t want to see me for a couple days. 

I apologized and thanked him for looking out for me, and explained how it made me feel. He apologized too, but he’s still unhappy with me.  Reddit what should I do? AITA? ",NAH.

"AITA for wanting to see my family over my Fiancé's?. So my fiance does not have the best of relationships with her grandma. However, yesterday they spoke on the phone and had a great conversation and, at the end, made plans to see each other this Saturday, her grandma lives about an hour away. I learned about this call today after the fact that my family had made plans to spend time together for a cousins birthday on the same day. Upon hearing that I would be going to spend time with my family because of it being a family members birthday my fiance got very upset and said she felt her family is coming in second place. Granted we do not go to her family a lot given the fact that they live about an hour away, but that is mostly because she doesn't have the best relationship with them.

"AITA for giving my Jewish friend a gift during the Christmas season?. This has bothered me for a while now.

"AITA for not offering a member of my friend group shelter in their time of crisis?. Throwaway because several other friends of mine browse Reddit and know my name (possibly the friend in question as well).

I have a local friend group in our late 20's-early 30's that all share a hobby.  We are pretty obsessed and have a FB Group Chat going nonstop.  I do know everyone in the group, but it is a broad spectrum of ""slightly better than acquiantance"" to ""best friend"" in terms of my relationship to each member. 

Well, shit happens in life sometimes and the chat becomes a vent chamber at times.  A friend in the group has come into extremely difficult times as of late.  They had a partner and they were planning to marry.  They bought a house together and everything.  The partner had some sort of mental break and afterward wanted nothing to do with my friend anymore.  Just a full 180 degree ""get out of my life please"".  The mortgage was under the partner's name, so legally they told my friend to leave, had a temporary restraining order and wrestled control of a shared bank account.  All of this has been slowly unfolding in the chat over the past two weeks.  We are trying to be supportive, but it is a tough deal.  My friend is mostly concerned about their dog and where they will live in the immediate future.

I own a house.  It is a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom house and I have no roommates or significant others.  I have an empty bedroom that this friend could easily room in.  But I really don't want to.  I just don't know the friend well enough to be comfortable with it.  My other friends can't really help like I can.

"AITA for asking my gf not to walk topless in front of construction workers. Me and my gf (both female) live in an apartment with very high and wide windows.

So By the title it sounds like I’m the asshole, my wife says I am but I really don’t know so I’m turning to you fine people of reddit.

So last night I got into a fight with my wife. She was saying I do t do anything around the house which is not true. I do all the manual labor stuff like taking out trash, yard work, shovelling snow. But she thinks I should do more around the house. I work in the oilfield and my work schedule is 14 hours a day (minimum, sometimes more) and I work 24 days and get 4 days off. I pay 100% of the bills, her phone, her car, absolutely everything. She is a stay at home mom with our 2yo son and all I ask is that there is food on the table and the house is clean. Is that too much to ask for? When I come home from a 14 hour day of manual labour outdoor wether it’s +40 degrees or -55 degrees I’m out there and I feel I shouldn’t have to do these chores.

"AITA for wanting my old home life back?. About three years ago me, my mum and my brother escaped a toxic relationship my mum had with her boyfriend (let's call him Scrooge). I was seventeen at the time and in my last year of high school.

The first problem started with the moving. I wasn't told that mum and Scrooge had problems. All the sudden one night I'm told that next week we'd start packing and the moving started right away.

 This was only slightly before my high school finals and I was in shock about it. The new house turned out to need a lot of work (and fixing is still going on) but I was told I would get a bigger room, so I didn't mind. I was just trying to not be a burden. Everyone's irritation with the moving process was pointed at eachother including me, while I didn't do anything but study and keep quite. 

The second disappointment was that the room I was promised wouldn't come. Mum wanted to turn it into her therapy room and I was told to accept this, since she had gone through a lot. I was ok with it, she needed it for her side business, but the lack of agency I had in anything pained me. The room I have now is so small I can touch the walls standing in the middle without moving.

Then there were the dogs we had to leave at Scrooge, while he can't even take care of a pet rock. Three lovely Caucasian shepards. It hurts me deeply still and the German shepard we could keep is too big for this house. He's suffering from it. 

That year felt wrong, but I hoped that after the moving was done, things would be better.  I also blame the moving for me failing my finals that year and having to redo it, but I'm not sure if that is fair.

The next year, I'm eightteen. My brother changed,  barking commands at me and my mother, being grumpy all the time and being let in on financial struggles while I'm kept in the dark about everything, I'm not comfortable with this change in my brother, he wasn't like that and I hate that he has taken on the behaviour I hated in Scrooge and my dad. 

My mum meanwhile has changed too, being grumpy and complaining, shouting and grunting when angry at anything, slamming with doors while making passive-agressive comments about how hard she has it whenever I mentioned I struggled with something. Nowadays I won't even open up to things to her anymore. 

Currently it's two days before my nineteenth birthday and I'm in my first year of law school. I cannot speak my mind to my mother or share details about my classes, my brother gets pissed off and yells about it.  I straight up don't feel like this is my home. It never was and I long to go back to three years ago. Even if it includes Scrooge. But I feel selfish for wanting that. Yet I feel angry for feeling selfish.

I'm on mobile bare, with me. Also, throw away accounts because I have anxiety. 

I'm getting, YTA and NAH vibes but I'm not sure. 

Anyway here is the deal. My friend we will call Jason has been sick recently he is having some pretty bad throat issues. He has been like this for almost 1 and a half weeks. Today is the worst of it. I came into class and saw Jason very distressed, me being the guy I am I asked what was wrong. I found out that he has been up all night, could barely speak, and couldn't hold down drinks and swallowing hurt like shit. He looked awful. I felt awful, I asked Jason what was up, and he said his throat issues got worse, it was very clear he had gotten worse. I asked him what his parents were saying and he told me that they were saying he was fine, and just being dramatic. He has a doctor's appointment in November but that's pretty far away, and he looked like he couldn't wait any longer. I asked him questions trying to figure out a way to help him, but there was literally nothing I can do. He just looked so defeated.

He has been in some hot water with his family recently and I can tell they treat his other siblings with more sympathy than him. I think it's unfair. Out of frustration, I turned to my parents. For maybe tips to help the pain, and also me bitching about his parents shoving it aside, and that I was just worried he would get worse. It's no fun being in pain. 

I told him that my family said to get better and he started to freak out. He said that if my parents told his parents, they would be super pissed, and get mad at him for telling some I guess? I'm not sure but based on what I've been hearing I can believe it. Note, my parents are very cool, they know when to keep stuff private and know when they aren't supposed to intervene. Bless them for that. I assured Jason that I only asked for advice since my family is notorious with throat issues (I have had inflamed vocal cords, and strep, inflamed vocal cords too many times.) 

After Jason left, and I gave the tip of hot tea and honey, I immediately texted my parent (I don't want to give much info away sorry) making sure they wouldn't say anything. They assured me it was all good, and they understood why I was so concerned. I am currently just stressed out, thinking it wasn't the best move.

I wasn't expecting to hit the jackpot but I did. My husband is the best man I've ever known and we are the absolute best of friends. He took my son in as his own and loves him to death. I'm so so grateful for him every day and my son adores him. It's just an overall awesome situation I never thought would happen. 

Okay. So my husband has always gone back and forth about wanting to have a child of his own. I've gone back and forth about it too since I had my son and ultimately I really, sincerely do not want to have another one. I have a lot of varying reasons for this.

 My husband does want one of his own. Mostly for the ""novelty"" of having a child with someone you love, passing on genes etc. A child who is biologically his that he helped create. I totally understand why he would want that and I empathize completely with how he feels. Although other times he will say it sounds nice, but he could really live without it and it's not the upmost important thing to him, he sees more benefits to NOT having another one etc. I think he feels like that sincerely at times but deep down he still wants one of his own. 

Today it came up again after a long period of time of not discussing it at all. We were talking about some bad shit happening in the world and I said that it's another reason I feel I don't want another child. From there it spiraled. My husband said that I'm denying him the opportunity to have one of his own. He said that I don't want another one because I'm lazy and simply don't want to put in the effort to raise another child. It got nasty. By the end of it after we both kind of cooled down the tone was basically ""if it happens it happens, if it doesn't it's whatever"" but now I feel this massive weight of pressure and guilt that I'm not sure how to get past. 

I get where he's coming from. I truly do. And I know theres a big possibility that down the road he will end up resenting me if I don't decide to have another child. But I absolutely cannot force myself to want it. I can't make myself have a kid out of obligation. There is no part of me that wants another kid. Honestly, I didn't ever want to have kids in the first place but shit happens I guess. I love being a mom, I love my son to death. I know there is a possibility one day I'll change my mind, and I accept that, but I don't want my husband to bank on that happening. 

So WIBTA if I remained adamant in my convictions to never have another kid for my husband's sake?","NAH

You have every right to not want another child, and he has every right to want a biological child. 

One of you is going to have to give in here, or part ways. There’s no win-win compromise and these are the types of life decisions that make or break a couple. Good luck, I hope you two can come to a consensus without having to walk away from an otherwise good relationship.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for not want to move to Mississippi with my stepson and girlfriend. So this has been a impending doom in our relationship and it’s because of her mother. Just a little back story for clarification we have been together for a little over a year and have a 4 year old son (stepson) who I’ve been the main father figure for since we began dating. When we started dating she told me her mother wanted to move back to Mississippi and she would want to go with her but it’s been nothing more then a fantasy until recently when her mother started prepping the house to sale. 

I have a good paying job and I have a 2 bedroom house with my girlfriend in Texas and not to mention all of my family. I told her that I didn’t think it was smart to move to a place with no job and no house as well. She then went on to call me selfish and told me that this is my choice to leave them. I don’t see this as being any of my choice but all her mothers and hers to leave. Not only does her mom have a grandson her son has a 3 year old son who currently lives within 30 miles of her. 

I feel like this is really selfish for her mom to want to leave one of her grandkids and take the other one with her knowing that it will end the relationship I have with her daughter and my stepson.","NAH. She has every right to move, you have every right to stay.",0,0,0,1,0

"AITA for being impatient about my car repairs?. On Halloween night, I hit a deer in my '16 Audi S3 doing about 60mph.  The deer took out the bumper, the drivers fender, the hood, and an intercooler behind the bumper.  I'm a big car guy so I was pretty devastated when it happened, but I knew insurance would cover it so its no big deal.

The next morning, I dropped my car off at a local body shop that was recommended to me by a mechanic I trust.  The owner was upfront with me that it would not be a quick fix as they already had a few cars waiting and Thanksgiving was coming up, so he guessed it would take about a month to complete.  Another reason it would take a while is that Audi parts are hard to source here and our town of ~150k people doesn't have an Audi dealer.  Also, the car would need to go on a truck and be driven 2 hours to the nearest Audi dealer to recalibrate the forward facing radar.  Between that and the parts maybe having to come in from Germany, I was ready for a long wait.

Insurance was quick about sending an estimator out and authorizing the repairs.  After the insurance cleared and the check came, I didn't hear much from the shop.  I emailed the owner on the 30th to see how it was coming along, but didn't hear anything.  I emailed again on the 2nd and received a response that they had been waiting on parts that finally arrived and now they can proceed with painting and putting everything back together, then getting the car to the Audi dealer and back which would take an extra day.  I was told to expect the car to be ready by the 6th.  I called them on the 4th to see if everything was still on schedule, and they told me it wouldn't be ready until the 9th.  I called on 6th and they told me it would *actually* be ready on the 11th.

I should note that after the insurance cleared, I had to initiate all contact with the body shop.  They never called or emailed me to let me know how things were progressing, I had to ask them, and then they would give me more information.

Today I called up the Audi dealer since I knew today was the day they were getting my car for the calibration.  The service department told me they weren't told they had to do a calibration and were only told to do an alignment and find the source of an error code being thrown by the newly installed headlight.  I called the body shop and told them they had to call the Audi dealer and tell them they needed to do the calibration, otherwise they were going to have to spend another day and send the car back AGAIN to the dealer.

There's a local car group on facebook that I'm in and I posted my experience there.  I did not trash the business, however I was frustrated and shared my experience because I wanted to know if this was normal or if I was right to be worked up.  Some people say that 5+ weeks is too long to wait for autobody repairs, while others say I'm being impatient.  One of the employees from the shop whos working my car actually commented basically saying I'm being too impatient.  Maybe they're right?","NAH

You’re not a jerk for wanting your car back and they haven’t done a very good job communicating with you.

However, even in a big city (like when I lived in DC) it can take time to source parts and do the work. 4-6 weeks seems pretty reasonable to me since they just got the parts last week.

In a lot of shops, not everyone is qualified to do “all the things” so especially this time of year, repairs take a long time.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for checking on an ex regularly while in a diff. relationship?. I’m in a new relationship and things are going great. We haven’t been together too long. Less than 3 years. All this time though I have checked in on an ex of mine regularly. Every six months or so & just reg. stuff like how her family/work/life is and updating her on mine. 

My new partner isn’t crazy about this. But I think she needs to get that we are just friends and wouldn’t date again. I get that it makes her uncomfortable but my ex was a big part of my life and it was a fine breakup. So theres no anger or anything between us, making friendship an option. It’s not like we are chatting each day. It’s only periodically and only so I can share with her (my ex) all the updates in my life and see how she’s doing too. 

AITA for chatting with my ex? I think my current GF needs to be more secure in what we have going on and realize that if I wanted to date my ex...I would.","NAH, but I do have a slight feeling that you’re a bit of the a for referring to a 3 year relationship as having not been “together too long.” Maybe your previous relationship was longer, but three years is fairly significant imo.

I understand your position, I remain friendly and/or friends with several past partners. They were people that occupied huge spaces in my life, and it’s nice to be able to check in on each other occasionally. 

I also understand your partners position, especially so since you seem to categorize this relatively long relationship as something new and untested. She’s probably pretty justified in her insecurities here. 

I think it’s important to prioritize your new partner. Does this biannual check in real mean enough to you that it’s worth hurting your current partner? That’s something I think you should really examine.",0,0,0,1,0

She called me, she wasn't angry/upset, but she seemed disappointed and after I asked about the invite and if she'd be coming she said that she will come but didn't need the +1. I asked why not and she said that she didn't feel ""right"" coming with just one partner.

weddings are expensive, giving someone who’s unmarried a +1 isn’t even required, let alone a +2. but she’s right, it could damage her relationships to choose just one person to bring. if you’re feeling badly about it and have the space you could offer her the +2, if you can’t afford/fit another guest i would just explain that and let her know it’s important to you that she’s there and you’re sorry you can’t accommodate both of her partners.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for wanting a non-monogamous relationship when my partner doesn't?. I am in a bit of a messy, undefined relationship with a person I deeply love. We've never been in an exclusive relationship, and since the beginning I told him I wasn't ready to be monogamous. He has always made it clear that is what he wants. We have been trying to make the open relationship work, but it is a strain on both of us. I have tried hard to respect his need to be monogamous while still being honest about my need to not be, and have told him that, while I love him and want to be with him, I'm can't sacrifice my mental/emotional wellbeing by ignoring what I need because it won't be good for either of us in the long run. And that if this doesn't work for him, he needs to make that decision and end the relationship. 

I have broken up with him a few times, always with us getting back together in a few days. I have felt like I need to be the one to end it because I am the one who is causing the strain, even though it kills me everytime. But then we'll start taking and get back together again. 

Recently, he broke up with me and we stayed that way for about two months, during which I did not contact him. I felt like if I were the one to contact him, I'd be dragging him back into a relationship situation he didn't want. I was miserable and missed him so much, but the guilt of knowing he was hurt by the situation kept me from talking to him. But then he reached out to me, and asked to come over, and we decided to give it another shot. He said anything is better than nothing.

I love him so much, but that doesn't change my need to have an open relationship, because I will fall into a pattern of self destruction I've been down before and barely survived. AITA for wanting a non-monogomous relationship knowing that it hurts my partner?","NAH, you're all allowed to want what you want. But I don't see this ever going well. Most monogamous people would (myself included) consider polygamy cheating, and desire a commitment. It's often a point of pride, that they're ""good enough"" for somebody to commit to them.

"AITA for not wanting to go camping this weekend with my husband because the bad weather will leave me to sit in a tent alone while he fishes?. So my husband and I go on an annual trout fishing camping trip each year. We typically go with friends but this year they’re all pregnant and close to their due dates or super busy, which is fine. I was looking forward to this trip as just the two of this year when the weather was supposed to be 70 and sunny. Now it’s calling for low 50’s, strong wind and rain. I *really* don’t want to go because I don’t fish and so with the rain it means I’ll likely spend most of the day huddled up in our tent, alone. He fishes from buzzer to buzzer which is something like 7 am to 6:30 pm. My husband is understandably upset that I said I’ll be pretty miserable if I go and he’s hurt that I want to cancel because this is how we celebrate his birthday each year as well. I also said I’d only go if we fit in a quick hike in the morning before the rain is supposed to start so that I was getting something out of the trip...so...Am I the asshole?

This is a long drive for us and so he doesn’t want to go alone","NAH

"AITA for not going to my high school best friends’ wedding?. So I graduated high school about 8 years ago and was the only student from my high school to go a specific university in our state. I’ve had little to no contact with anyone from high school since, primarily because I have trouble keeping in touch with people I don’t see on a semi-regular basis. The only contact I’ve had with this couple was we ran into Target on Black Friday one year when I was visiting family. We chatted for like 5 minutes before resuming our consumer carnage and splitting ways again.

Well, in high school I was semi-responsible for this couple getting together (I encouraged the guy to ask out the girl in middle school, and they haven’t been apart since) and apparently they remember it. I got an invitation to their wedding with a note about how they’d appreciate all their high school friends to come and be with them on their “special day.”

I held onto the invitation a bit to try to convince myself to go, but in the end I RSVP’d no. My reasoning is:

1) I haven’t seen them in going on a decade now, minus the one random meeting at Target. 

2) I hate weddings. Just gonna be honest here. 

3) It’s weirdly in the middle of the week (Wednesday) and in my hometown, so I’d have to make additional plans. 

4) I didn’t have a date. Lol.

She didn’t rant or bridezilla me or anything, but I ended up feeling pretty shitty about the whole thing. AITA or am I just being over empathetic?","NAH. She asked, you said no.

"AITA for giving my school the proverbial middle finger. Tl;DR at the bottom.

As some of you may be aware, there is something schools in the UK can try to achieve called a rights respecting school award. This usually involves sticking posters around the school and selecting students and teachers to stand up in assembly, pretending to care about the rights of the child. I completely see the reason for these rights and support them 100%. But the way schools achieve the award? Not so much.

So my school achieved this award, and to celebrate, organised a celebration day on may the 4th (Just a few weeks before the start of our GCSEs). The celebration involved a non uniform day (dressing up as star wars characters) and an obligatory one hour long assembly, to which the mayor was invited.

The assembly was, imho, too close to the exams to be taken out of a lesson, so I decided to take a chemistry past paper in to the assembly - as it was chemistry that we were missing - and spent the whole hour completing it.

No one said anything during the assembly, and many teachers said well done afterwards, I'd imagine the assembly had annoyed them too.

However, the one interaction that I found the most amusing was with the organiser of the event:
He asked why I was doing my maths homework in his assembly, to which I bluntly replied that it was chemistry.

He didnt have a response and somehow didn't give me a detention. Am I the asshole?

TL;DR Exercised my right to an education during a self congratulatory assembly on how the school was so good for achieving this rights respecting award.

"AITA for trying to scan a QR shirt?. TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm walking in the park and I see this lady wearing a white shirt with a huge QR code on the back. It drew so much attention to itself that you seriously couldn't miss it. Clearly the shirt was designed to stand out and make you want to scan it. Me being the curious little idiot that I am, I take the bait and try scanning it.

This lady notices me and says ""Um, excuse me, are you trying to take pictures of my kids?"" I didn't notice it at the time, but yeah, she was walking with two little girls by her side. (Keep in mind I'm a minor, and I think that's quite apparent based on my appearance.) 

I say ""no, sorry, there's a QR code on the back of your shirt that got me curious."" I assume she just forgot she was wearing something that begs to be photographed, and she's genuinely looking out for her kids. She goes ""Uh, a QR code? What's that?"" I don't want any trouble, so I say ""Oh, it's a black and white code that you scan and it takes you to a website."" She goes ""Don't take picture of my kids bro, that's not okay."" I apologise and walk off because she's probably going to take this further if I don't.

Then her husband (at least, I assume it was her husband) stops me and goes ""Hey, were you tryna take pictures of my kids?"" (He is obviously aware of what his wife is wearing; he's standing about 30m away behind her.) I say ""No, sorry, there's a QR code on the back of her shirt that I wanted to scan."" Granted, that sounds quite strange out of context, but he *did* have the context and he just didn't care what I had to say. He asks to see the photos I got of his kids (I didn't get any photos) and I assume that's going to be enough to calm him down, but he just keeps going. ""You really shouldn't be taking pictures of kids in the park, that's not smart. Unless you want the cops after you? Is that what you want?""

I'm getting quite annoyed at this guy, and if he's threatening to call the police I figure I might as well point out to him that I do have a leg to stand on. ""You do know what a QR code is, right?"" He's not listening to me at all and he says three or four times in the middle of my sentences ""Do you understand what I'm saying? Don't be taking pictures of kids."" Again, let me point out I have no photos of his kids. Or even of his wife. She stopped me really fast, which might have been just good cautious parenting, but I think she was just trying to pick a fight.

TL;DR: Woman is wearing a giant QR code on her back. I try to take a photo of it. It turns out she has kids with her I didn't notice, and she and her husband freak out at me (a minor) for trying to ""take photos of [their] kids,"" even after I explain that I'm just trying to see what the QR code is. Now I'm trying to determine whether that was a bad move on my part or if they were just trying to pick a fight.",NAH...but situational awareness goes a long way.

"AITA for not wanting to give my brother a ride home?. There's quite a bit of context behind this, so please read the whole thing before judging.

I would also like to note that this was about 2 years ago, he has since learned to drive himself, but still brings it up to this day. Looking to settle this once and for all haha.

So about 2 years ago, I had recently graduated high school and moved on to college. I've always hated getting up early, so with my newfound adult power I structured my new life around going to bed late and getting up late.

I made sure all of my classes were no earlier than noon, and my job was an evening shift, so my bodily clock was set to begin the day around 11 AM and have ""me time"" at night until around 2 AM.

My younger brother, still in high school at the time, was doing cross country practice. We live about 10 minutes from the school by car, and he has friends who are on the team with him who live nearby. It was August I think, because he wasn't in school but was still going to practice.

Practice ended at 8 or 9 AM, I cant remember, it was morning practice. He needed someone to pick him up and bring him home on the days when my mom had to work, which was about 50% of the times he needed a ride.

He would often ask me the night before to pick him up the next morning, to which I would always oblige, but I was never too happy about it and I made sure he knew that. Not to be an asshole about it, but to let him know this was something I really did mind doing because I was losing 2-3 hours of sleep over this. I know it's not long to drive there and back, but once I'm up, I'm up. No more sleep until the early hours of the morning.

My issue with it wasn't giving him a ride, it's just that he considered me his first option. He had his friends parents give him a ride before many times, it bothered me that he didn't at least ask them first before assuming I'd do it. If they did have some issue with bringing him back, I would've happily stepped in and did so myself. I also would've been happy to do so any time if I was notified preferably 2 days in advance, 1 at the least. (I like to plan my evenings, it's what I look forward to all day)

I understand where he's coming from, I used to do cross country and often had to wait hours for someone to be able to pick me up, if I didn't want to wait I walked. But my issue was he didn't think about why I was always so unhappy doing it, rather he just said ""it's not that big of a request!"" And acted like I should've just done it.

I feel like it was sort of a big request, since I had so purposefully structured my life around not getting up early. He was quite literally asking me to rearrange my sleep schedule at a moment's notice to accommodate him and what he's doing, again something I did anyway even though I had my reservations and would have been more than happy to do if he would've checked with someone else first or ask me in advance.

Was I the asshole here?","I'm gonna say no assholes here. If anything your brother was kinda assholish for his  entitlement. You're a good sibling for going to get him even if you didn't want to. 

Me and my sisters all had the same issues, I think it's in the nature of siblings, especially with you being the older sibling. ",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for believing I get to control the amount if contact I have with my family?. 25 year old married female.  

When I was 17 I moved out of the province my family lived in because I wanted to grow up and I was craving privacy from my very close knit family.  I believed that that move sent a clear message, ""I need space.""  Perhaps it didn't though, because my older sister, a few years later would leave our moms house and move into my living room for some weeks and eventually to a house 5 minutes away from my own.  Which I find annoying.  

The main issue here is with my mom and my sister, they are both needy people and require reassurance throughout the day.  Both of them try to talk to me daily but I do not respond daily, because I don't want to.

 9 times out of 10 they are texting me shit I do not need to know nor do I care about.  

Examples of text messages I am expecting to have a response to: ""I made a peppermint mocha but I put too much peppermint in it.""  ""The bus is really late, this sucks."" ""I saw this product ..... on the shelf at the grocery store.""  Or it's simply a paragraph describing in detail the meal they just ate. 

 I don't respond for a variety of reasons, I don't care, I don't know how to respond to the statement, I didn't see the messages, or they overwhelmed me with messages. 

 They both do that thing where you break up a paragraph into texts containing one sentence each.  I have an anxiety disorder, I get overwhelmed really easily so when I open my phone and see 5 messages each from them I just put my phone away.  

So then when I  don't respond in a day I start getting messages like, ""Hello??""  ""Love me!""  Or just my name with a period, my mom likes to do that, I think it's her way of saying my name sternly over text.  

Also, I'm a baker so I wake up really early every morning and go to bed really early as well.  They both know this but send a good deal of their messages after I've gone to bed and then get upset when I don't respond until the next day when I'm done work.

There has been one win though, they no longer ask me if I'm okay or what's wrong because I text straight up responses with no jokes or emojis.  Happy about that at least.  

Personally, I believe that you are under no obligation to answer your phone.  I don't think that simply because somebody wants to get ahold of you, means they should be able to.  I don't agree with being accessible at all times of the day, I don't think that's why we have cell phones. 

AITA for not responding to every text message the same day it is sent?  Sometimes it takes me a couple days, I know that's because of the anxiety but still, is there some widely accepted response time frame to text messages and calls?","NAH, but it sounds like you haven't managed to communicate to them that you're a working adult that needs more space.

"WIBTA If I Tell My Father to Stop Cooking?. Some details here: I live with my father and two brothers (17,15). I'm in my early 20s, Asian,in a country where it's normal to still live with the parents. My mother had passed away 4 yrs ago. 

My mom and dad were living separately since I was 8 or 9 years old, dad lived alone in the same city. They were not in a good relationship because they always had different views on things, mostly finance(To put context at what this different view is, my father had lots of money and always spent them on projects that cost him a fortune,no profit. My mother always disagreed about him working on those projects bcs it's too much risk and he took the certificate of the house we were living in and gave it to the bank for debt)I was much closer to my mother and have always looked up to her bcs in my opinion she was always the rational one and had always taken care of me and my brothers very well despite her being in a wheelchair (since I was 8). My father(64) and I are rarely on the same page.

He moved in after my mother passed away.

In the house, I do all the house chores, beside my brothers who did laundry. I've scheduled myself to do sweeping&mopping the floor twice a week, major cleaning since I still have classes to attend in a university.

My dad now has ""no money"" (he sold our other house) for his another project. It was two years ago. Now idk where the money went or if he still has some left. He wouldn't tell me about it. Idk what he's doing, he's always at home, trying to find things to do, fixing things but not really, and leaves the mess for me to clean up. Then, he cooks. I can cook too, and I always told him to just let me do the cooking instead bcs it's always so messy after he cooks. There are cooking oil splashes on the wall, greasy floor, greasy counters, chunks on floor and counters, stinky sink. Sometimes he'd clean the cooking utensils, but they're still greasy when I check. When anyone steps out of the kitchen after that, one would bring the greasy footstep from the kitchen to the dining room. I don't want to be rude to my father, but the cooking is definitely not worth the mess.

When I tell him to let me cook, I tell him it's because so I can cook better over time, other times I tell him it's so he can do work. But he keeps cooking when I'm not looking, so early before dinner hours. I am so tired now to keep cleaning the same mess over and over every damn day.

Today I sit down to consider telling him I don't want him to cook anymore because of the problem mentioned. Then I saw him looking around the house wondering what to do bcs he probably doesn't have a job now, idk. I think maybe he insists to cook because it's one of the useful things he can think of doing and I kinda feel bad if I try to take it away by telling him the truth in my head. I want the cooking and grocery shopping duty all to myself so everything in the house can be cleaner and more in order.","NAH doesn't sound like he's being a jerk on purpose and neither are you, I mean you already have a lot to do its hard to clean up after someone everyday, why not see if he can help with a big chore around the house to make him feel useful and get that off your shoulders.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA My friend’s friend spilled my drink so I let her buy me a new one. So my friend (call her A) and I were out, and her friend (call her B) came to join. I had never met B before, but she seemed nice. 
We went to this place which serves nice cocktails, which are around around £5-£8. We each got a cocktail, and were sat at a table. 

As we went to get another cocktail, we noticed that there was a booth free. B went to sit at the booth so nobody could take it, and gave A the money to buy her cocktail. I ordered an £8 cocktail and walked back to the booth were B was. 
The booth is designed so only one side is open, so you have to shuffle down the seats to let other people sit down. So I could shuffle effectively, I went to put my cocktail down on the table. But B told me she would hold it instead of me setting it down. No idea why she did that. But I went to give her the cocktail instead.
I’m going to be honest, I thought she had hold of the cocktail, so I let go. But she didn’t, and the cocktail slipped. I didn’t let go quickly, I waited until she had hold of it, and then let go, but she still dropped it, and said she didn’t have hold of it properly. 

I apologised and went to clean up the cocktail, and she apologised too and helped. I wasn’t concerned about the cocktail, just about clearing the glass up. She said she would buy me a new one, as the cocktails weren’t cheap. I told her it was okay, but she insisted and so I let her. 
We carried on with our day, had quite a nice day, and that was that. 

I don’t really talk to B because she’s A’s friend, not mine, but A made a joke recently about me dropping my cocktail and B having to pay for a new one. 
I said that B actually dropped my cocktail, and that’s why I let her pay for a new one. A brushed it off, but now I’m panicking a bit. 

AITA for letting her pay for the cocktail? I know she dropped it, but the way that A made the joke makes me think that maybe B thought I dropped it, and is annoyed that she had to buy a new one. Or I’m panicking that she thinks I’m stingy because it was only £8. I feel really bad and think I am a bit of an asshole but at the same time, I did say she didn’t have to pay for one and she insisted. 

Help me Reddit :(

"WIBTA for saying no to my childhood friends wedding invite?. As a bit of context, childhood friend and I were very close as children but then lost contact for abt 10 years, they (among others) became very close to me for about a year and I really appreciated the friendship and the love I got from them all while we were close, then a couple of years ago I fell into a really deep depression and isolated myself to heck for roughly 2yrs straight, I lost my small business, I was supporting my mum in rehab, I lost a best friend but I continued to try and wrangle the situation for way too long and ended up with a bunch of debt I'm still paying off. During that time there was only a few people checking up on me, it would be a lie if I said I didn't have any hard feelings that childhood friend wasn't one of those people. But at the same time, I was also barely speaking to anyone/using social media/reaching out. The last time I spoke to childhood friend was maybe a year ago, we went out for dinner before I moved even further away from them (normally we are 3hrs apart, now we're a bit further) and I really wanted to reach out and apologise for being so distant and explain what had been happening w me and just generally have some friendship since it had been a long while.

FFWD to getting the wedding invite and I find out that the event is at a very ritzy location about 2.5 hrs away from me, it's a beautiful spot and probably the nicest one in our state. Since going out to dinner I hadn't heard from childhood friend until they message me telling me that I will need to purchase accommodation asap and that no one is free to share rooms with me anymore because it's getting too late (this was 8-9 months prior to event), they also mentioned that carpooling will be tough for me because they know that X friend of mine has a full car. I check pricing and ""early bird"" for the cheapest accommodation in the vicinity is $150 per night, I've been asked to stay for two. It's a lot for me at this stage in my life and I can't stop thinking about how $300 + food and transport is more than half of a down payment for a new rental which is 100% my top priority atm, I'm living out of a single room at my mums and it's full of all the gear I need for work and school. V uncomfortable. 

So tldr friend is having an expensive wedding and I am very poor while paying off recently acquired debts.

I really want to say no but I think that childhood friend will cut me out of their life if I do. While I was in my hole I was threatened with no invite at all unless I met their fiance by a certain date. They had started dating while I had begun withdrawing and I was making shitloads of excuses as to why I couldn't attend parties etc in the year they were dating prior to getting engaged. This would just be another one. :(","NAH. Your friend has tried to include you in their special day, it’s just unfortunate that you can’t afford it right now.

"AITA for ‘forcing’ my wife to become a pescatarian like myself by refusing to cook meat for her?. My wife and I have been married for a year. She works in corporate banking and usually gets home at 8pm while I work for my father’s company and have flexible hours so our set up has always been that it’s me who cooks our meals. I love food and cooking (that is how I won her over) so that has never been a problem, until now. 

I have been overweight for most of my life, but this year I decided to do something about it. I’ve been going to the gym and eating healthier, and have adopted a pescatarian diet (the only meat I eat is seafood). As a result, I’ve stopped using meat when cooking our meals because I don’t want to be tempted to eat meat if it’s already there, and it’s more convenient to cook just one protein instead of two.

My wife is supportive of my lifestyle change but thinks this is unfair that I am ‘forcing’ her to also adopt my pescatarian diet by not cooking meat for her (she has never been overweight, she doesn’t go to the gym and she loves red meat). She shops for and cooks her own food during weekends so that she can eat meat, but she cannot cook her own food during weekdays because she gets home late. I understand that, but having meat around makes it difficult for me to stick to my pescatarian diet.

AITA?","NAH. You aren't ""forcing"" her, but I can see how she might be irritated since she doesn't have time in the evenings. Your reason for not cooking meat, which is not wanting to be tempted, is totally reasonable. If you refused to cook meat based solely on principle that would be a bit different, but you're just trying to improve your health. 

There are some compromises though, people meal prep all the time. Your wife could cook meat on the weekends and then she could have meat for a couple of days at least (I wouldn't eat meat past like 2 or 3 days in the fridge, I'm not sure how long it's actually okay for) that she can heat up with dinner. I think meat in the fridge that you didn't cook would be easier to abstain from.",0,0,0,1,0
"WIBTA for asking for a refund for a haircut after the fact. So, long story short, I usually cut my own hair. If I ever have another place cut it, they only do the back because the back is just a simple fade behind the ears, and it saves me time than having to set up two mirrors to do it.  


However, I got my hair cut earlier in the week, I told the woman exactly what we're doing. What does she do first? She pulls my bangs back and runs over the whole thing with a buzzer. She then starts talking in a very 'friendly voice about how it's been a long time since I have had my hair cut! Yeah, must be because boys aren't supposed to have anything other than buzzcuts I guess. I told her she was going a little short cause I'm good at not overreacting immediately and was going to see if it was fixable. She then does the same to the other side so now I have like a widows peak with bangs (just a strip of bangs in the center, none on the side.) IT looks awful.  


I thought I might be able to salvage it and paid for the cut. I went home and realized how awful it was. I was talking with a coworker about how awful it is and I said that I'm going to be asking for a refund and she said that that's an asshole move to ask for it a couple days after the fact, and not while I'm there.  


So, I'm wondering if this is some sort of socially accepted thing where it HAS to be  while I'm still there and would I be an asshole for asking for that refund now. I definitely am going to be posting reviews about this experience because this wasn't the only thing she fudged up on  


1) the round curve at the bottom of the fade, she couldn't do. The back of my hair is just one length and the base isn't shapened.   
2) she didn't even trim the hair behind the ears, it's oddly longer than my bangs are now so if it's not gelled back I look like a mental ward patient got loose with scissors on their hair.  
3) She cut a bald spot into my hair. I'm not bald or balding, she just I guess put the wrong buzzers too far in and went ""woops, let's hope he doesn't see that""",NTA. She really went nuts there man. You should definitely try to get a refund.,0,0,0,0,1

I'm graduating college in Brazil this year and, as usual here, we are supposed to throw a graduation party for family and friends. My girlfriend of two years is my classmate and we have been planning to do a party together, because we have a lot of the same friends and it would be super cheaper this way. 
Well, the day before yesterday, my mother (who I have had a lot of trouble in the past, specially since I started dating) decided that she didn't want to throw a party with my girlfriend's family, because she wouldn't be comfortable that way. 
I told her ""ok, but I have made plans with -girlfriend- and I would like to stick to them"". It then turned into a huge fight, she basically was trying to make me feel guilty for ""excluding her"" out of the process of planning the party (even though nothing was planned, except that we would do it together). I told her that it was my graduation and if we're having a party, I would like to do it the way I planned.

"AITA for not wanting sister-in-law to hand out homemade urns at family gathering?. This is actually for my wife (W) and favorite sister-in-law (FSL). This year marked the 5 year anniversary of their father’s passing. Their aunt will be hosting a family gathering next weekend to celebrate his life and to make available many of his personal belongings to the various cousins and relatives. (Their step mother recently moved and in the process a lot of items and mementos were found.)

W and FSL have another sister (I’ll be kind and refer to her as bad sister-in-law: BSL.)  She is the black sheep of the family and is notorious for being selfish no matter what the consequences. 

BSL asked W how many people will be there because she want to bring something. She was pleasantly surprised that her sister would want to contribute with an appetizer or dessert and responded with “About 30.”

A day or so later BSL sends a text and picture of homemade urns. Her intent is to hand them out like party favors. We are all appalled.  After consulting with friends and family, the unanimous consensus is that (while her intent may be good) it’s disrespectful to their father and the family’s wishes.  (Not to mention that they look like a summer camp art project.) When W and FSL contacted BSL, her response was “I’m bringing them anyway.” and “People won’t have a problem with them.”

Some context: when their father passed away his wife and the daughters (W, FSL and BSL) got scatter urns from the funeral home. Anyone who wanted some of his cremains has had them for years. Those who don’t have them do not want them and/or feel uncomfortable with it.

"WIBTA if I completely cut off a toxic and controlling best friend?. I broke up with my girlfriend in January, and we’ve remained best friends since then. However, in the past couple of months, I’ve noticed her being really controlling and toxic, and I’ve realised her behaviour hasn’t changed, and she’s always been like this. 
I’ve had pretty severe depression this year, and she’s offered her support, which I’ve accepted. However, in the past couple of months, my therapist and I have been working on me being more independent, and this independence has made me see how toxic her behaviour is. I’m going to go through a few examples, but this is by no means everything that’s happened.

She gets intensely jealous of me hanging out with other friends. I told her I was going to have a communication break, so I texted people s little as possible for about a week or so. During this time, I went out shopping with my friend Sam. Sam put this on her snapchat story, and my ‘bestie’ saw it. When i met up with her two days later, she was furious that I hadn’t been texting her, and that I’d met up with Sam and not her. I tried to explain that the break had been good for my mental health, but she kept saying I’d really upset her, so I ended up apologising, which didn’t sit right for me, but I let it go.

She and I and a load of school friends attended a close friend’s house party a few months ago. We had been broken up for a few months at this point. She asked me if I would mind if she kissed someone else at the party. I said no, because that was the truth, I wouldn’t be upset, she can do what she wants. She got upset at this, and said it was hurtful that I’d moved on so quickly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that she was the one planning on getting with someone else.

I tried talking about my feelings about all of this a couple of weeks ago, but she refused to see my perspective, which was that my mental health was taking a turn for the worse. She said that because she had supported me so much, she deserved a reward, and that me taking issue with some of her behaviour was not a reward. I said that I had been talking to my therapist about everything, and I didn’t get much further than that because she was so mad that I had dared ‘gossip’ about her with my therapist.

I’ve had to turn off activity statuses on WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat, because if she sees that I’ve been online without texting her she’ll be upset. I’ve talked to many other close friends about this, and they advise me cutting her off completely, and not contacting her at all. We’re starting different sixth forms this week, so it’s an ideal time to do it. I don’t know if its the right thing to do though. It would upset her, and I don’t want to do that, but on the other hand, I’ve tried talking to her about it, and I’m dreading seeing/talking to her.

"AITA for demanding too much from my girlfriend. My girlfriend owns a bar and was sick with a really bad fever the past 4 days, I stayed at hers (above the pub) because I knew she was pretty bad and could use help with running errands, getting food/water/meds, keeping her company and covering shifts etc while she recovered. 

I ended up catching it off her and she asked me to stay at hers so she can keep an eye on me. I was concerned that being above the pub it would be too loud but I have epilepsy and tend to be more prone to seizures when I'm ill so I thought it would be good to have her keep an eye. (The last thing I want is to choke on my own puke while I'm having a fit) so I've been there all day, she came up to see me about 3 or 4 times for less than 5 minutes each time and I understand that she's busy working but it got to the point where it was getting way too loud and I couldn't handle it anymore.

An hour later of trying to get a hold of her to ask if I can go home and I ended up going down to the pub to get her. She told me to stay in bed and rest but I kept saying I wanted to go home because it was pointless me being there, she wouldn't even know if I was having a seizure because she's busy working and I want to be somewhere quiet.

I tried to explain that I had missed out on client work (filming) because I was taking care of her and that I just want her to spend a bit more time with me.

"AITA for asking someone to respect me?. New to reddit and on mobile, I apologize. 


I had this friend in a grade lower than me. At first she was awesome and we understood each other and our problems. We were similar. Soon though, she started to morph into something I didn’t like. She would do the classic guilt trip whenever something didn’t go her way. 

Ex: I can’t hang out with her because of a family meeting “Oh don’t be sorry. It’s not that I’m disappointed! I’m just glad that you told me.” 

Things like that would bug me. She’s also in the LGBTQ+ community and is trans and pan. I’m so proud of her for being open and proud but it got to be too much too often. Every ten minutes, “hey guess what! I’m trans!” And a stupid little nod. Snapchat, constantly. She would always blow up my phone too. 

We were hanging out with a mutual friend at the mall and were in the apple store. I hear her tell our friend “hey make an Animoji of GotSpawnKilled” I said NO and went back to drawing on the iPads. A couple of minutes later I hear her say, “look I made one of GotSpawnKilled” I was mad, I told her to delete it and she said she would. 

A couple hours pass and I’m bored at home. I’m looking at Snapchat for minor entertainment and see she’s posted. “Huh, what could this be?” It’s none other that the Animoji she made of me. I’m pissed. I send a message saying, “you said you would delete it why is this on your story?” She gets all “sad” and regretful. I don’t remember much (bad memory even if this was a few days ago). Basically I get all mad that she completely disrespected me and did what I directly asked for her not to do. 

I go back to my day. She then sends me a snap from her story “I think I just lost the trust of one of my friends and I’m so scared that I’m going to lose her. I can only be embarrassed around her now.” Now I’m totally pissed. “See what I posted on my story for you? 🖤

"AITA for calling Thanksgiving off at my house because my family can’t get their share of the bill to me on time?. I’ve (30yo F) hosted and cooked thanksgiving at my house every year for the past 7 years. I told my family I’d really like to take a break this year and just go to someone else’s house for a change. Nobody wanted to offer up their house, and nobody wanted to cook either.  (I also host and cook for every other family holiday as well, Christmas, Easter, and 4th of July) 

So back in October, we compromised and decided to get it catered and still have it at my house anyways... I asked everyone to pitch in some money and to get it to me by the latest this past weekend, (because I -knew- we would have issues) I wanted to have everything set early. And I wanted cash in hand incase someone bailed last minute and left me with the bill. (not unheard of) 

I reminded everyone at least once a week either in person or through texts for nearly a month...

Only 1 person out of 3 came through. So after weeks of reminding... here we are. No money from half the family. 

SO.  I called everyone one last time.

I asked my sister (yet again) to please bring the money -today- because this is my deadline. She yelled at me about how she couldn’t make it over to my house today and that plans change so I needed to come get her money... she lives 40 minutes away, that’s over an hour drive for me, I said I’ll have to see if I have time...

Next I called my mom, she said she had church today but I could come get the money from her house. She lives 20 minutes in the opposite direction of my sister. 

Frustrated, I said nvm... even handing over money is too inconvenient for everyone, yet I’m supposed to handle it all. Without me there would never be family functions. The least you all could do is give me the money on time. (Guess who still has to order it, set up for it, and clean up after it)

Well that didn’t go over well with my sister. She threw personal insults, and even told me she “hates me with every fiber of her being” and that I’m no longer welcome at her house, and to leave her and her family alone... 

I’ve been upset and crying all day because I just wish holidays could go smoothly for once, and my sister also hurled very personal insults about my job, and my mental health issues... 

The thing is, I COULD accept their money this week, and have the food ordered in time (I think) but I don’t want to deal with these people! AITA?? 

Sorry for the typos grammar and spelling. I’m pretty exhausted from the BS...


EDIT: My sister refuses to get any kind of pay app, she’s too lazy to figure out new technology. My mom has to “look into these kind of things” because “you never know who wants to steal your identity 🙄)


UPDATE:

So after I said I’m out, they still really wanted everyone together. so they came back with we’ll tell you the time an place and just show up.  I said I could deal with that. 

My mom apologized and said they’ve been too reliant on me to take care of the holidays, my shitty sister still doesn’t get it, but I don’t care, she probably never will. 

Anyways they forgot to order the food from the place we originally were going to get our catered thanksgiving, and ended up having to drive over 45 minster minutes to a different place to pick up precooked cold food we had to reheat. 

Heating up the food, my mom was clearly flustered, (everything had to be timed differently) which made me feel bad, but my decent sister stepped up and helped. (Even though she was already hosting)

The food was shitty, my mom and sister were exhausted, and my asshole sister and I are at least copacetic.

"AITA For being mad my GF made out with her friend?. So my GF recently had a ball she went to, but I wasn't able to go and she was asked to go with a family friend of hers (guy). I trust her ofc and although I don't trust him I agreed, especially since she was going with a close gf of hers who happens to date my best friend. Anyways, as they were out at this ball me and my friend were hanging out as a boys night, and he got a snap of her girlfriend saying that my GF and his had made out, along with a selfie of them kissing. I've yet to talk to her but personally I still see that as being fucked up. My friend just sees that as hot and girls being girls. AITA?

"AITA for taking the parking spot.. Ok normal scene. PACKED parking lot on a Saturday. Driving up and down aisles and 100% of the spots are occupied. Bingo, I see someone 5 spots ahead shut their hatchback. Stop the van with just enough room for hatchback to reverse out and wait for the free spot.

I see a white sedan coming from the opposite direction and make the same manoeuvre. There are exactly zero spots available. Reverse lights just engaged on the hatchback. Oh h*ll no! White sedan is crazy if she thinks that spot is hers. I put my blinker on just in case it's not obvious. (I probably should have done this immediately when I stopped. It was an oversight but in my mind not a fatal one.)

White sedan is not phased. Persists in appearing as though she is entitled to hatchback's spot. The nanosecond hatchback is clear of my van, I'm in the spot. White sedan is honking and visibly in disbelief.

I give her my best 'too bad, too sad' look and get on with my day. Am I the asshole here? Was my fatal error the delayed indicator justifying her entitlement to the parking space?

"AITA for being a member of the ""Summer Movie Kids Club"" at my local chain theater as a 49 year old single guy?. So I guess how to describe this...my local movie chain (statewide) does this program where in the summer they sell a package of tickets for $60 (in this case) for 12 weeks of movies. So the movies are almost always second run kids movies and you can go to one movie a week. The movies always happen at 10AM so its obviously geared towards kids, moms and babysitters. You more or less end up seeing the same groups and families every week.

I work overnights and don't make a ton of money and just generally enjoy the movies, comfortable seats and cool air (I live in a cheap ass apartment that doesn't have good AC). When I saw the theater was having this deal, I went to the manager and asked if I could buy one...he said of course and I thought cool no big deal. 

I usually get off work at 8AM so what I would do is stop at the theater, park in the shade and sleep for an hour before the doors actually opened at 9, then I'd go in, grab my snack and chill in the theater until the movie started at 10. I always took an out of the way seat and would enjoy the show. 


Well last week on my way out a typical ""Karen"" came up to me and asked if I had any kids. I said I did. She said she was curious but she never see's me with them. I told her I didn't want to get into it but I was divorced. She said asked again why I don't bring my kids to the summer movie club which are obviously for kids. I said I just enjoy kids movies. She said ""you're that pervert I see sleeping in your car."" I told her I'm not a pervert and I just am on my way from work. She said I really slept in my car to see Shrek?  I told her I just wasn't comfortable with the conversation and left.

She went to the assistant manager and however she spun the conversation I was banned from the theater. He threatened to call the police and I can't have a parole violation. This was last week and it's about 9AM now and I'm going to go in and talk with him and try to justify myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong. 

Basically if I was the asshole, I'll just leave and go to movies somewhere else. If I wasn't the asshole, I'll go in and make my case (this theater is about 7 miles closer to my apartment than the next one, so it's just a nice convenience to be able to come here).

"WIBTA if I skip the Super Bowl?. Background: My sister has been married for 11 years and I'm very close with his family. He has a little brother, John. John just got engaged to Anne. John works out of town ALL the time. Anne works part time at a doctor's office and has a lot of animals. 2 dogs, 3 cats, two fish tanks and a bird.

Anne calls me and says her company is having a Christmas party that is 45 minutes out of town, she asks if I would like to be her plus one and then stay there overnight. I agree. We leave town at noon (she drives) to hang out before the party. We have a semi-decent time. The next day I jokingly say ""Lets go to ""town that is 2 hours away"" and spend the day. Anne gets SUPER excited about this and so what the hell, we go.

While we're driving, I ask who is taking care of the animals and she says nobody. I’m surprised at this and worried because we've been gone at least 28 hours at this point and won't be back for at least another 4-5 hours. Her dogs are locked up in her garage, no way to go outside and they have a giant bowl of food and water. I say "" we need to have my sister or John's brothers or my boyfriend to go check on them right now."" (They have a coded door so it’s easy to get in) and she gets really upset with me, stating that, ‘I'm telling her how to take care of her animals and it is none of my business’. I argued for awhile and eventually replied that I was just trying to help, if she doesn’t want to call anyone, we should turn back. She declines.  We finally make it there and I throw a big enough fit that we go back earlier than planned. They were alone for over 30 hours.

When we come back, it turns out that her dog has eaten a piece of plastic and died from internal bleeding. She's had this dog for 5 years and it is HER dog, she brought it into their relationship. I feel guilty because I was the one who suggested we should go on the longer trip in the first place. But, I feel she should have said no because her dogs were alone?! I expected her to feel at least as guilty as I feel. I understand accidents happen but internal bleeding from a small plastic takes time and if someone was there the dog might still be alive. I texted her asking how she was, that I was so sorry this happened and she replied, ""Meh. Least we had fun."". This pissed me off and I haven't spoken to her since.

She is hosting the whole family for the Super Bowl and I honestly have no interest in seeing her right now. I told my mom and sister why and they are both saying I'm being an asshole because ""it was just a dog"" and I can't blame her for an accident"". I have 2 dogs that I adore and I for sure do not feel that way. I feel like an animal she was responsible for died as a result of her actions. I don't want to go because I will say something mean to her (even I try really hard NOT to) and I would just rather not have the confrontation or damage my relationship with John as I don’t blame him.

"AITA if I don’t want to share personal things or talk with my family who gossips?. My family on my mother’s side has always been super “close”. I say this because my family thinks they are close with everyone but in reality they only know so much about one another because of everyone gossiping and having a big mouth. Anything that goes on in my family, everyone finds out somehow. So growing up my cousin, my older sister and I were super close. Told each other everything. As I’ve gotten older I’ve realized how toxic my family is and the reason why I was so depressed in the past was because of my family and where I was living. I moved almost 2 years ago to live with my husband in the uk due to the military. I do miss home sometimes but I’m very happy I moved to the uk. Best decision ever honestly. I am somewhat close with my older sister but our relationship definitely has changed. My cousin and I are not close at all now. We grew apart or I should say I grew apart from her because of how toxic she is and how shitty she makes me feel.

My husband is my best friend and the sweetest man, but my family likes to gossip and start drama. So I’ve been hearing stuff from my sister how I never talk to anyone in the family since I moved and how they are all worried about me (because of my husband). They think my relationship is like my parents which is very offensive to me because my dad is very disrespectful and an asshole. None of my family likes him. Anyways my cousin and I recently spoke on the phone and she was complaining how I never tell her anything anymore and that she always has told me things. I just don’t think I’ll ever want to share things with my family because of how toxic they are. Am I the asshole if I want to stop speaking to most of my family?

"AITA for not wanting my ex in my room?. I'm a college student, and my ex and I broke up about 5 months ago. As of Valentine's day or so, she has been dating my roommate.

She was mentally and emotionally abusive to me and I do not want her in my space or even close to it.

However, I'm worried it's unreasonable to expect my roommate to not allow his girlfriend in his bedroom, and I am not spending very much time in that room anyway since I've been spending nights with my new girlfriend.

"AITA for not siding with my friend. I was having coffee with a Mom gal pal of mine. Her husband and my guy both work as chefs at the same business. It's one of those members-only club dealios. One of the servers has been there for 30+ years. He's established a shit ton of rapport with the guests after so many decades. The guests also like to give gifts whenever the mood strikes. 


My Mom friend thinks it's unfair that he's always getting attention and gifts from the members. For example, a common gift will be tickets to an event, sport game, etc...

She feels upset because he'll share the tickets with his family instead of dispersing them among other employees, i.e. her husband. Her words were something along the lines of, ""everyone else shares their gifts with the other employees, but He always just takes them for him and his family
 I think it's just selfish."" 

Now, she is right that most of the other employees will share their gifts with other employees. However, usually when back of the house gets gifts its rarely ever to anyone in specific and just given to whomever hasn't enjoyed a perk yet. Also, most of the people she's referencing that shares their ""gifts"" are relatively new employees. I'm talking under 2 years. She also mentioned something along the lines of, ""It's not fair because He works where he can talk directly to the members and (her husband) is always in the back.""

Now, my responses to her have been things like, ""first off, your husband is an executive sous chef. Even though the server has been there 30 years, your husband was hired on making a hefty salary, a lot more than that server. And that's the price of being a chef, you work back of house. Kinda hard to do your job if ya ain't in the kitchen. I could be wrong though. Also, if I was working there or anywhere for 30+ years, I would absolutely be sharing with my family. Instead of constantly sharing everything with employees who come and go. Our guys have only been there a year and a half at this point. Aaaand, we still get unexpected tickets to things. I think after 3 decades, he should be able to enjoy himself without having to explain anything.""

I dont know. I've always been a firm believer that when there's any kind of gift giving from a customer to an employee, that entitlement really needs to take a back seat. I could be wrong.

"AITA neighbor issues. I've been looking at this sub for a very long time, and I can honestly say in most scenarios it helped me decide if I was being a prick or another person was.

I'm 16 turning 17, so this question is kind of uncommon.

My parents have always hated talking with my neighbors, for some reason, and now I see why. I live in a suburb, many generational homes, because some of these houses are massive and multiple generations live in them. As such, there are a ton of cars in our streets.

I live on a half couldesac, , and my neighbor across on the outer end of the L shaped street owns a car shop. On multiple occasions, HOA has fined him for bringing up to 8 cars to his home and working loudly at all hours of the night.

The problem is, because he hosts drunken parties in his front yard like about 2 days a week, he parks the total 2 cars he has, in front of my house, not directly in front of the driveway but spaced so I literally have to squeeze through his two cars to get to my driveway. It's not that much of an issue, but when I come home from school, I park on the edge of my driveway to play basketball in my driveway court for a few minutes, and in front of my eyes, my neighbor nearly reversed his car into mine while trying to park, in front of MY driveway ACROSS the street from his house. At that moment , I thought enough was enough.

When he got out of the car, I said politely, ""Hey, \[Neighbor\], how are you?"". ""How's school,"" etc. Then I asked directly, if it would be all right if he didnt park his cars in front of my house, because the majority of the week that he doesnt have parties, 5 days, he doesnt need to park in front of my house leaving his driveway empty. His response, which I predicted, was that there was no law that said he couldn't, which was true, but I told him if he was obstructing my path to my driveway safely, then the law was against him. I told him how he almost destroyed the left side of my car, which he had to know himself.

He then became aggressive trying to look down to me and push up on me, but I'm about 6'4, so physically for him there was nowhere to go. I backed away even though I was half a foot taller and probably weighed 50 pounds more, and told him the next time he parked in front of my driveway, he would have to deal with the HOA and my parents. He hasn't parked here since.

I've been grounded by my parents.

They think my unusual ""fraternizing"" with the neighbors is what got me to this point, and all I did was reinforce the stereotypes about black people being aggressive in our Chinese-Indian dominant neighborhood,etc. My other neighbors like to joke about it because they think I put a grown adult in his place, because he doesnt park in front of anyone's home anymore, but my parents haven't let up on me since.

"AITA for speaking a foreign language class?. I am currently a senior in an american high school and my girlfriend (gf) moved in from Thailand a couple of years ago. We share a ""Creative Writing"" class where we basically study stuff like shakespeare and write or own stories. It's pretty fun and there's lots of freedom in it. However, non-english work is a huge no-no.

This is where things get a little complicated.

Gf has always had a hard time speaking and comprehending english. Of course, she has improved a lot in the two years I've known her, but still struggles with reading Shakespeare (cause y'know, old english is different from modern english).

So while were working on a research project about the Scottish play, Gf gets confused and asks for help. Of course, I help by translating a portion in modern english.

"AITA for cutting off a friend for knowingly dating my stalker?. So in 10th grade, this guy from my school (we’ll call him R) found me from tumblr and started following me around school. It was kinda creepy, but I didn’t think much of it. But one day, R comes to school, guitar in one hand and a bouquet full of flowers in the other, surrounded by all his friends. They push me to the center of the quad area at school, in front of EVERYONE, and R starts performing a song he had written to ask me out on a date. I’m mortified. He, all his friends who helped orchestrate this, EVERYONE, is just STARING at me.  Keep in mind, I hardly even knew who this guy was. He literally just found me online and started stalking me. I finally manage to say “um R. Can we talk privately?” I pull him aside and say that while I appreciate the song, I would rather just be friends. R got PISSED. He starts guilt tripping me saying stuff like “I set aside EVERYTHING to do this for you!” as if I EVER showed any romantic interest and as if I EVER even asked him to do any of that. But, R still accepts to just being my friend.

Except he didn’t treat me like his friend. From then on, R tried controlling every aspect of my life as if we were dating. He would get angry at me for hanging out with my friends and not him. He wanted me texting him at ALL times during the day and wouldn’t let me sleep just so I had more time to talk to him. if I fell asleep I would wake up to tons of angry messages asking where I was, calling me horrible names. He would stalk all of my social media so he could see if I was online and scream at me if I was and just not responding to him. I lost so much weight because of how stressed I was. I must have lost 5 days of sleep to avoid R’s awful, abusive messages. I had to start changing my route to my classes at school because if R ran into me, he would start berating at me right then and there, in front of everyone. 

Finally, summer comes and I’m able to avoid R. I fled all my social media, remade, and blocked him on everything. The next school year comes, and I become really good friends with this girl we’ll call S. We ended up becoming best friends and we vented to each other often. Of course, R came up while we were talking and I told her everything and she was horrified that I had to go through something like that. Until a couple months later, S and R start dating??? I was floored. i kept telling S “I’m glad you’re happy, but I don’t really feel comfortable hanging out with you because of what R did”. S says “What did R even do to you?” I tried again and again to remind her what R did and that she was welcome to date him but I wasn’t sure if I could remain friends with her because of how much I feared for my own safety, but then after a couple weeks she would immediately forget what R had put me through. S and I started growing distant because of this, until finally, for my own mental health and well-being, I stopped talking to her.

She's honestly been perfect, she cleans up after herself, if she eats something she replaces it within the same day, she pays us ""rent"" even though we tell her that's not necessary she still insists.

And plus she's a blast to be around, so I've been loving having her here. Something to know about us is that we are both ""*hardcore feminists*"" lol not really but we share a lot of the same strong views, she looks like your typical ""**SjW LiBtArD FeMiNaZi**"" as *certain* people would put it but she has a good sense of humor about it and steers into it.

Why I'm telling you about this is because well I do consider myself a feminist, I have very different views when it comes to sex. I love to be degraded, I love being called misogynistic names and being used like an object. If that's too tmi then I'm sorry but I needed to tell you for context, thank god reddit's anonymous because that is something I'd rather have no one know about lol.

Well she was supposed to be gone for the day, and me & bf decided to have some fun because we had nothing else to do. I should mention she did have a spare key and I can be quite vocal when horny. So we didn't hear her come home early and we had a pretty long session, I don't know how much she heard but apparently it was a lot.

When we finished I didn't even know she was home because she left for a while but when she came back, she was acting strange. She seemed to be giving my bf some bad looks and she asked to speak with me in private I thought she had something important to tell me. But she started asking me if I was alright or if I'm hurt and all these other questions.

I was confused as to what she meant and she told me she heard my bf saying some horrible things in the bedroom but I quickly explained to her what we were doing and that I liked it, she quickly went from concerned to disgusted. Asking me how I could degraded myself like that, if I had any respect for myself and how I could be with someone like my bf, I felt offended immediately because she was judging me and my bf for our private fantasies, We got into a stupid argument and it led to me kicking her out.

This happened last week and thankfully she hasn't told anyone and she has also apologized saying she was in the wrong and she shouldn't have judged us, I've forgiven her and she's not going to be staying with us anymore because I suspect she's still not entirely comfortable with our sex life. Everything seems to be back to normal and I feel I overreacted by kicking her out, it seemed a little harsh looking back.","I think the fact that she said she was sorry is good. 

Part of feminism is recognising that it gives women the ability to chose what they want. Sounds like she was shocked initially but pretty quickly came to her senses and remembered that it's your business!

He looked at me weird and I laughed and said “why do you ask”. He says, “ well I am a vet and me and her are about to be married”. I’m obviously confused about how that had anything to do with my nursing career so I say to them “oh my gosh congratulations guys! How exciting”.

"WIBTA for not going to the memorial?. My step-father passed in his sleep on the 26th of February. I attended memorial services for him on the 7th and 8th of March, showing support for my grieving mother and the rest of my family. Since then, I've tried to be there for my mother in what limited ways I can, given my schedule conflict due to the spring semester being in full swing.

The end of the semester is fast approaching, with my finals just two weeks away. Now, my mother wants me to fly to Utah with her and one of my brothers for a third memorial service in my step-father's home town. She hasn't given me an exact date but, from the sounds of things, I'm either going to be out of town when I need to be studying for finals or I'll have barely finished the semester and hardly had time to breathe before I'm off doing more stressful things, where I know I'm probably going to get yelled at if I'm not on 100% angelic behavior.

"WIBTA if I called non-emergency line on a serial trespasser?. Okay so I’m staying with my parents for a little while, she’s in a 55+ Mobile home community and while my father and I work she’s home alone all day (disabled). For context we live in socal, about an hour away from the border. 

There is a Hispanic man who drives a old beat up pickup truck who keeps coming on my parents property asking to do whatever around the house. Sweeping the driveway for instance. He just trolls the park trying to find someone outside to badger about yard work. 9/10 he stops when neither me or my father are home and it makes my mother uncomfortable. She always says no to whatever he’s asking to do, but he constantly comes back at least once a week. My mother has had a few things go missing from the car port (tent used for storage) and she’s convinced it is this man. 

If I’m outside on the patio I’ll see him drive by once or twice a day. He clearly doesn’t work, and is seemingly preying on the people in this 55+ park. 

Just after I got here about three months ago, I was on the patio smoking a cigarette and he and another man drive up, walk up the carport, and into the closed tent we have setup at the end and asked me if I lived there. At the time I was supposed to be visiting and he turned around to the man in the truck and said “
solo visitando”, laughed, and left. 

just today he stopped while my dad was out on the patio talking to a friend via FaceTime, with noice cancelling headphones on. I heard the car door close so I went outside the front door thinking it was my father just getting home. I walk around the side door and the man keeps saying “hey” louder and louder not noticing my father can’t hear him. So he opens up the tent and jabs him on the shoulders scaring the shit out of my dad and points at the weeds behind the house (not our property as he has been told more than once) and says “you pay me to cut?”  My dad got pissed off and told him again that it wasn’t our property and to stop asking. 

He doesn’t knock on the door unless my fathers car isn’t here, and my mothers home alone. He doesn’t work for the park, there is already a maintenance man here who comes around to do things. I don’t know if he’s legal, and I’m not looking to call ice or anything on him either. 

He makes my mother extremely uncomfortable, so much so that she’s asking me to setup a camera to see if he’s ever on the property when no one is home. 

I’m not sure if he’s breaking any laws, if he’s allowed to be here, as he definitely doesn’t live here. His truck isn’t parked here overnight. (mom asked me to look around more than once to be sure.) 

At the worst case I’m not looking to get the man deported but at the same time I’d like my mother to feel safe in her own home, and I’m not sure where to start but to call the non-emergency line and making a report.

EDIT: For fear of sounding bigoted/racist: We’re all against deportation, and that’s the only reason I mention his ethnicity/and deportation. We see ICE pretty often, and the last thing we want to do is get this man deported and possibly be removed from his family.","NTA, that's what the non-emergency line is for.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for making my children wash their clothes in the bathtub with dollar store detergent?. My kids are aged 14 m and 15 f. The other day my son asked if I could wash his favorite shirt for some event coming up, so I told him I would and to put it in the hamper. Later that day I found it just sitting on the floor so I didn't bother. Same thing with my daughter, she asked me to wash something (don't remember what) and she got the same response. Same thing happened with the piece of clothing on the floor instead of the hamper so I didn't bother

Later in the evening they started bitching about the clothes they requested not being washed and I told them ""all you had to do was put it in the hamper"" to which my son said ""yeah but it was near the hamper you can just pick it up"" to which my daughter agreed. I didn't say anything more about the issue

The next morning I went to the dollar store and bought some laundry detergent. When my kids came down for breakfast it was sitting on the table, and they asked what it was. I informed them that until they stop being entitled spoiled brats that they can wash their own clothes, but not with MY washing machine. I informed them they will be washing all THEIR clothes from now on in the bath tub with dollar store detergent until they start being respectful and I receive an apology for the remarks about picking up their crap near the hamper AND once the detergent runs out they have to use their own money to buy more but they're only allowed to buy it at the dollar store.

"AITA for for getting mad at my gf when she brings people who openly talk shit about me into MY house?. As title suggests, for the past few days now my girlfriend has been bringing her coworkers/friends over into my house and normally I wouldn't have a problem with that, except with this specific group of people. She's a little younger than I am and all her friends constantly want to go to bars and clubbing but Im not big into that scene and would rather stay home those nights. I guess at some point one of her friends decide to tell everyone I'm ashamed of her, or maybe even cheating on her and I'd rather bring some side chick over than go out drinking with them until sunrise. Next thing you know, whenever she's with them, she feels the need to ""confirm"" all these ideas they're putting in her head about me and its all stereotypical insecure bs that just ends up stressing both of us out. 

I've gotten to the point where I told her, if she wants to hang out with them, by all means go for it, I'm not the kind of guy thats gonna dictate who she can and can't spend time with. She's an adult and able to make those decisions for herself, but Im not interested in being around any of them in the slightest. She doesn't invite me out with them anymore and I'm more than okay with that, they're not my crowd to begin with.

"AITA for ending a friendship of 8 years by deleting her number and quitting all group-chats she is in? I sometimes feel bad about it but I‘m so relieved I have cut this person out of my life.. *Obligatory apology for using mobile, making this post so long and not being a native speaker*

Situation: 
I (24f) was friends with a girl (25) since 2010. We befriended at a time where I didn’t know I was an introvert and that it is totally okay that I am not people-y etc. (had no self-esteem because I was so awkward, had no introverted friends who‘d understand me, spend my weekends alone, you get the idea) and she lifted me up, made me feel better about myself, got me out of my shell. After some time I actually gained my self-esteem, made more friends, met the love of my life and was more outgoing and confident. I first thought she would be happy and proud that I „made it“ and finally loved the person I‘ve become - just like she seemed to be. I was very thankful and we had a very good time since then. I also met and befriended her friends, we were a wonderful group.

After we completed school in 2013 and had to choose what to do with our lives, the contact stayed but she started acting weird. Would cancel plans we had for weeks hours, sometimes even minutes before the get-together and  often without a real reason (e.g. „I suddenly don‘t want to go to a restaurant, I have difficulties choosing what to eat.“ „My mom wants me to clean the house.“ - ?!). That went for years. It pissed us off and we stopped making plans with her (we still invited her but in 90% she would cancel it on the same day and we wouldn‘t be surprised and disappointed).

What made me think she hates me:
She had a best friend since we knew each other. I know him as long as I know her and naturally we became friends, too. One day she suddenly went apeshit crazy and yelled at him and he called me after that. I was shocked as I never saw her acting this way and couldn‘t think of a reason. He then said that she asked if they could meet for a bbq and he asked, if I could join them - she began accusing him that he liked me more and said something that really hurt „Why is she always so overrated?!“. She made hints on this topic before („When you are there, nobody talks to me, I get ignored. Could you stop wanting to be the middle?“). I never had the feeling that I‘m being the „center of the conversation“ (I‘m introverted as I mentioned, I hate being in the middle and she should know that). But eventually I stopped talking to people when she was there so that she could be the center of attention. I really don‘t need peoples‘ approval. 

What made me snap:
We were on a festival together last year and she started acting terribly. A friend and I arrived on wednesday to get a nice camping spot (festival started on Friday). It was exhausting, but eventually we found a spot after hours of searching and discussing with other campers. We were proud and sent pictures. She started going crazy that the place was shitty, even threatened to sell her tickets if we stayed on that spot. I felt like being hit in the face. We could not move, there simply was no other space for a group of five. When the rest and her arrived she started yelling at us two in the middle of the night and acted like a total bitch. We ignored her after some time and the rest of the festival was fantastic. She never apologized but started behaving like the friend I knew, well, up to that point. 

This year we went again to the festival and she started behaving the same way, being passive-aggressive while planning how to get there etc. I snapped and deleted her and the groups we‘ve been together in - I just didn‘t want her to ruin the festival again. 

I didn‘t answer to her calls or bother explaining anything to her - I was and still am done with her and don‘t want to see her anymore. And I‘m pretty sure she exactly knows the reasons but wants to pretend everything is fine and that we‘re still close friends after last year‘s incident. She eventually started talking shit about me but I don‘t care. Our mutual friends ended contact with her over different situations (many don’t even know about me breaking the contact) and those who know me wouldn‘t bother anyway.

There were many more occasions that lead me to the conclusion that she hates me but I don‘t want to make this post any longer - sorry for that 😅 but if there are questions I‘ll answer them.

But AITA for not explaining anything to her? Should I reach out and tell her what went wrong? Or should I continue being happy without her knowing my POV? I often dream about us talking about it, but I think she won‘t be as rational irl as she is in those dreams 🤷🏼‍♀️

Thank you for reading this mess. And happy holidays if you celebrate them 😇

"AITA for not wanting us to park on a disabled spot despite me technically being disabled?. So this argument between me and my friend F. actually happened a little over a week ago but I had no idea this sub existed until today. To understand the issue we had you need to know that I'm technically considered disabled, both due to various chronic illnesses as well as due to being blind on one eye and visually impaired on the other. I am not however mobility impaired. The visual impairment disqualifies me from driving any vehicles so one of my friends usually drives me when I have to go to the city for some reason, in this instance for a new pair of shoes as the soles started to separate on my current pair. F. had to go to the city to run errands anyway and invited me to come along, which I was very thankful for. 

When we arrived in the city there were a lot of people and the parking spots near the shoe store were all taken except for one disabled parking spot. The next open parking spot was two blocks away. F. thought that we should park on the spot reserved for disabled people because, after all, I *am* disabled. I on the other hand was very insistent that we park the two blocks away and just walk to the shoe store since, while I am disabled I am not in fact mobility impaired and think the special parking spots should be reserved for people who need the additional space for their mobility aids. Not only that, I also felt uncomfortable because I thought people would stare at and judge me because you'd have to look very very closely to notice that there's something wrong with me. I do not look disabled. We had a short argument in the car, she said I was narrow-minded and ornery, I responded that I couldn't morally take up a parking spot that wasn't meant for me and didn't want to be shamed by people... Long story short, we parked 2 blocks away and walked. 

Now it's not like that made a dent in our friendship or anything, as soon as we left the car we both moved on but she was jokingly pestering me about it this morning and I just want to know whether I'm the asshole in the situation for making us walk 2 blocks because I was afraid of people judging me or if I was justified in asking her to park somewhere else. My friend knows how thankful I am for her help as I tell her so often, and neither of us had or have any ill feelings towards each other about the argument. It was more of a friendly squabble anyway, we're not the type to actually fight or make a big deal out of stuff like that.

"WIBTA by telling my roommate to clean her room or I will move out. ... or am I better off just getting through the lease and leaving in April?

I love my roommate. They are one of my greatest friends. Ideally, they would remedy the issue and we would sign an extension on the lease. That would be my end goal.

#### Backstory:

My roommate has a cat which I knew before we moved in together. We agreed that the litter would stay in my roommate’s room since I was concerned about my dog going through the box. Both animals have free roam of the common areas as do we, and we each take our animals in our rooms for the night.

I don’t know if it’s a litter issue or a cleaning issue, but the cat started peeing on anything and everything a few months ago. I begged my roommate to take the cat to the vet which they begrudgingly did but apparently the cat was so poorly behaved the vet could not take blood from it. The cat was treated for UTI, but the peeing has continued.

#### Issue

The cat odor is insufferable.

At this point, the entire apartment smells. I have purchased an air filter, dozens of air sanitizers ~~purifiers~~, and cleaned all common areas. Nothing covers it for more than an hour or so. My roommate claims she smells nothing and cleans properly after any accidents.

A neighbor has complained by leaving a note on the door and I suspect we’ll be served a notice to cure between thanksgiving and Christmas.

Beyond possibly getting evicted, the smell is unbearable. The entire apartment smells like ammonia. My eyes water. There’s no pee yet that I can tell on my furniture, but I suspect the cat gets free roam while I’m not home and has accidents that aren’t cleaned fully.

#### TL;DR

My roommate’s cat pees everywhere. The whole apartment smells like pee. My roommate does not smell it, but a neighbor has complained and I’m afraid my landlord will take action.

Would I be the asshole if I threatened to leave, possibly sublet my room, or otherwise find a way out if she doesn’t fully remedy the issue? Or am I better off covering up the odor as best I can and just making it through the lease?","NTA, if you are both on the lease you could be held responsible for the mess.

"AITA For not wanting to be asked about my love life?. (Wasn't sure if this was meant to go in r/relationship_advice. I don't think so but if So, sorry, it's my first time lmao.)

Okay. So, compared to most of you here. I'm younger. To the point where I'm not even in college etcetera. So I'm still at the point where adults look down on me/tease me and whatnot.

Now I know for a fact that I don't know everything and whatever. And I do respect adults, I promise.

However, I'm just going to get into the story. My Mother has a friend who enjoys making comments about my love life. Asking if I have boyfriend yet and commenting about how, seeing as I've never had a boyfriend, I'm sure to get one soon or I'm seeing someone behind my parents backs. Now, I get this is all harmless joking, but it really makes me uncomfortable. See, I'm gay. My Mother and a few of my close friends know this. I don't enjoy this teasing because a lot of the time I just want to tell my mother's friend, no. I won't and don't have a boyfriend because I'm not into guys. It just really gets under my skin and I can't help thinking I'm being dramatic.

Now, the other day, I came downstairs on my phone, my mother's friend spoke up and said ""See, ____ is always texting her boyfriend."" With a short laugh. Normally I'd just ignore this, but I couldn't, I paused and moved to speak to the woman. I told her simply that it would be nice if she stopped mentioning my love life all the time because it made me uncomfortable for reasons I don't want to discuss.

She didn't take it all too well and seemed to nod understandingly, but then continued to side eye me and shit that honestly I thought was a little immature.

My mother pulled me to the side and told me that I was being an asshole. That her friend was only having some fun with teasing me and that id dampened the mood for everyone. At the time I thought I was totally not in the wrong. This woman was making an uncomfortable and my mother knew why. It would've made more sense for her to politely tell her friend to be quiet. Especially as I had expressed my discomfort to my mother on one occasion.

But I've been thinking and I can't help feeling bad. It's not like the woman knew and she is all round a very jolly person, I'd describe her as having a 'heart of a child'
And thinking back I can't help but worry that I snapped and spoke a little harshly. Idk. My mum isn't impressed with me and I'm not impressed with myself either. Like I said, she didn't know of my discomfort and it's not like the trading was doing any harm.

"WIBTA if I talked to my gaming group about issues with one member?. Background: I'm in a regular tabletop RPG group that meets ~weekly. Essentially the idea is that it's games based around telling a collective story, where we all play characters in the story. This means that it's a heavily social game, and if you ignore the game you can get lost.

One of the members is just really pissing me off with a lot of the things she does, but I'm not sure if I'm just being petty about it due to my own hangups. Effectively, my biggest issue is that she keeps bringing things to distract herself from the game, like books or podcasts. It doesn't bother me if people get distracted by needing to make a call, or message someone on their phone, or get distracted by a side-conversation or something. But when you actively choose to bring a book to the game, read it during scenes your character is IN, and regularly need to ask ""Sorry, what's happening?"" to try to catch up, it's needlessly detracting from the entire group's experience IMO.

This isn't even like an important assignment thing or a ""Needs to be done by tomorrow"" thing or anything. She wanted to read Dune before the movie came out, but she brought the ~400 page book to the game night and started it at the game.

At the last game night, she even pulled out headphones to listen to a podcast. She only used one earbud, but she was at the end of the table and used the ear that was facing the rest of the group.

She even announced she was bringing a friend to the next game, which also pissed me off. It's fine, and nobody has a problem with it, but I feel like you should ASK about it instead of just declaring that you're doing it.

There's also other small things she does, like interrupt other people or just ignore the group during the initial small-talk phase while everyone is arriving.

I'm not sure whether to bring these issues up with other people in the group, or whether they're just petty and clouded by the first time I met her. She tried to completely change the game dynamic, then got pretty pissed off when she said ""I bet all of you only really play THIS style of game"" and we all told her that wasn't true. (Imagine if a bunch of people who really likes foreign films started a movie night to watch new and different foreign films. They invite a new person who immediately writes a long email on what movies they should watch, and the group disagrees. Then the new person says ""Oh, I bet you all only really watch Action movies or Marvel movies..."", everyone at the table shakes their head and says ""No..."" and the new person snaps and very angrily says ""Don't interrupt me when I'm talking!"")

So is this something worth bringing up? I don't know how other people feel, and I don't want to start anything over petty crap. But I feel like she's just really inconsiderate and disrespectful to the group. And despite being relatively small, that kind of things really pisses me off.","NTA. I can tell you if this was someone in my D&D group, I'd be real pissed about the way she's ignoring the game. that's disrespectful to everyone else there and disruptive to the game.

You can try asking the other members their thoughts privately, but  I do think talking to the DM first to tell them that this bothers you is important. You'll probably find it bothers them as well.  Then, let your DM speak to her about it. Even though they aren't technically in charge, DMs/ GMs do run the game and therefore have a kind of authority there. Don't go in as a whole group and gang up on her though. That'll make her feel really attacked and will probably end badly.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for not wanting to attend church the way my mother wants me to?. Just to give some context, I’m 17, about to start my senior year, and I’m a section leader in my marching band (and very involved with band). Just recently my family and I had a breakdown, and we agreed some changes needed to be made. One of those changes we decided was to try church. I’ve never been to church before so religion is very new to me. I attended last Saturday, and I appreciated it but the topic of the sermon was why people should stay in the church, which gave me the impression of an hour long advertisement for church. I want to give it another shot, but I have some Biblical questions I want to ask before I go again. I’ve messaged the church and they said it would take a few days before they can reply, i.e. most likely not before the next sermon this weekend. I want to miss this weekend’s sermon to see if I can meet with a pastor before I go again, as that would make me so much more comfortable with this whole thing, but I’m out of town next weekend too, so I would be missing two weeks of service.

My mother really wants me to go to church and push aside all other things, because otherwise she doesn’t think I’m trying to make the changes that need to be made, and she thinks I’m trying to blow off church (a weekly event) to do senior traditions (a once in a lifetime event). She also says that I’m special (as in smart) but not special (I shouldn’t get to meet with the pastor first) and should not get special treatment by the church, as she never did when she was a young child (younger than I am now) going to church and ended up believing just fine.

"AITA for telling my friend of 10 years to go eat a bag of dicks?. Basically I have a friend who I met in college ten years ago. When we first met he didn’t like be and later admitted it was because he saw me as competition (something that I never felt or saw).  Later in school something clicked and we became the best of friends doing everything together al” of the time. There was always felt like he placed  a large amount of distance between me and his other friends, for instance if any of his friends invited me to events without his knowledge he would freak out. At first it didn’t really bother me but the more it happened the more I noticed and the more it bothered me. 

After college I moved away and started my career, got engaged and began medical school but he just stayed in our college town and kept his college job. After about 6 years we both ended up in my hometown and he lamented about the lack of a social life and sense of community he felt. It made me feel bad so I set up a game night with all of my friends to welcome him into the city, I went out of my way to rent a venue.  He didn’t even show up. He claimed that he didn’t know I planned anything except I asked him what day he was free two weeks in advance and checked in almost daily with the details. 

A year later I got sick, called off my engagement, lost everything in a hurricane, and had to leave medical school. Initially I called him to chat and set up a time to meet and hang out because I was feeling lonely and could use support. When I called he was excited to grab a drink but when I updated him on the status of my life he went cold and said he might be busy and let me know… 2 months later (with no communication) he texts me to hang out and I say yes but prefaced the hangout with stating my disappointment in his moral support. He apologized and said he understood. We hang out regularly and I even set him up with a friend and they start dating. He begins to distance himself even more and eventually cuts me  out of every social event. 

6 months later he pops back up asks me how I’m doing via text, I am honest and say I’ve been struggling with my mental health and he goes silent again… for 2 months.

"AITA for not coming over to help my GF with the cops?. Lately at my girlfriend's apartment there has been a rowdy neighbor who plays loud music past midnight, even on weekdays.



A couple weeks ago I was forced to call the cops on the neighbour after he refused to answer the door to talk. I then told my gf that I would call the cops and come over to talk to the cops, if this should happen again. 


A couple days ago, the neighbour was playing loud music AGAIN, while me and my GF were chatting online. My GF has said that she has already slept through his music many times before, so I asked her if it was loud enough that I need to come over. This is because I've been working 12 hours a day for the entire week including that day. If she said it was too bad to ignore, I fully intended to go over and call the cops.

Some examples of what she did include 

- they told me their wedding date 2 days before the wedding (I new of the prior engagement before hand but never knew the date) 

- leaving doors locked and not giving me key/code to our house in Chicago Winters

- continually putting down whatever I like

- severely punishing me more for minor things than her own kids MAJOR things 

- persuading my dad to not take me to a specialist for what I thought was depression for over 2 years( after I finally budged we went and it turned out I had depression)

"WIBTA for refusing to let my family visit me in college?. So it sounds bad I know but hear me out, (apologies in advance for my horrid grammar) I'm the first person in my family to go to college and I'll be living in a dorm for the school year. My family is very close so obviously it's a hard time for everyone. I'm just as sentimental as everyone else is but I'm ready to start living my own life and be (for the most part) independent. 

Last month I decided that barring the first month, I would try to come home once a month depending on my work schedule and coursework since it's only a couple hours drive. My family also decided once every few months they'd come and visit for a day with the same stipulations. I am completely fine with this arrangement as I think it gives me a chance to live my life and get acclimated to being an independent adult while still having a positive relationship with my family.

As we were packing up today it came up that my grandmother and my dad want to not only visit me next weekend (literally the week school starts) but also plan on coming to visit every other weekend. Obviously I'm not okay with either idea and I expressed that to then as soon as they said it. My mom also sided with me but they still decided I have no say and that ""I'm being unreasonable by sticking with our initial agreement"".

"AITA for not letting my brothers father in law come to my sons birthday party?. Just to give you a back story on this. My relationship with my brother and my sister in law hasn’t been good for the past 6 months. 

Recently my brother and his wife went on vacation, and my mother and I were watching their children. My sister in laws father texts me out of the blue asking me if I am with the kids. I didn’t know his number nor was I with the kids at that time. I tell him no but I would be with the kids soon. That was the end of the conversation with him that day. 

Then, my brother and his wife get back from vacation and my sister in laws father calls her and tells her that I wouldn’t let him talk to the kids (which wasn’t true at all). He makes a big deal about it. I text him asking him to help me understand what happened here because I was confused. Once again I was accused of not letting the kids talk to him and that I didn’t responded to his texts quick enough (it was only 15 mins), and that I should have known what he wanted. Now, he calls back my sister in law saying that I’m rude and confrontational. I haven’t spoken with my brother or sister in law since then because I felt like my side of story didn’t matter to them. 

Now, fast forward a few weeks. My sons birthday is coming up. I get told through my mother the day before my sons party that my brother said his father in law is coming down for the weekend with one of his other grandchildren and they are coming to my sons birthday party. My brother didn’t ask me if his father in law could come. He just assumed it was ok. My husband and I rented a hall and paid for everything for our friends and family to come down. Why would I let someone who is not my friend or family member come to my sons birthday party after I feel like he was causing drama with me for no reason a few weeks prior to this. 

I told my brother that my husband and I spoke and we don’t want any extra guests at our sons party and we were sorry if that meant my brother and his family couldn’t come.

My family has a history of being what we call here in the American South “worriers,” meaning she worries about every little thing I do, so she refuses to leave me home alone until she gets back, and is making me stay at my grandparent’s house. I, on the other hand, believe that she is helicoptering my life and not allowing me to stay at home alone so she can know exactly where I am while she’s gone. I explained to her that while I appreciate her caring about me, it’s unfair to treat me as if I’m 6 years old.

I disagreed and stated that I have earned my independence through making good life decisions and proving responsibility with my job and schoolwork.

"AITA for never giving to charity?. So when I was a youngster I did an internship in a charity. During that time I learned several things about the charity business in general. Nothing secret, things that many people already know, but they were things that made me uncomfortable nonetheless and so I decided that day that I would never give money to charities ever. For reference the things that many of you already know or can guess are that:

- Only a small portion of what you give is actually used to help people.

- A big portion of what you use is used to advertise for the charity instead of directly helping people

- The advertisement is showing you more misery and poverty than the situation warrant to guilt you into giving more money. For instance I was in a charity that was helping orphans. They were pictured in the ads with dirty clothes in shabby rooms but in fact they were well taken care of with good clothes, good food, spacious individual rooms and entertainment.

- The advertisement is sometime kinda racist. For instance a charity helping children in poor neighborhood will picture cute little helpless white kids instead of kids of colors despite the fact that they represent the majority of children in this situation.

- The CEO and top managers of the most famous charities are rich AF with their huge salary paid with the donation of poor people (most people who give are poor).

- Most people working in charities see it just as another business and our donation is used as a resource to extract the most efficient way possible.

- Many of those charities have hidden political or ideological agendas I disagree with (some are against LGBT, some will help only a portion of the population by targeting an ethnicity, some will have unsavory links with a shady government, etc).

- If I give money to one of them, I wonder if my money would not be more helpful another way. What’s more important, feeding poor people or cure cancer?

- Sometime it feels like whatever the amount of money you give, it doesn’t have any impact. The world is still a shitty place and it doesn’t seems to change

- When you give money, you enter a database and you can expect to receive mails designed to guilt you for the rest of your life.


I know all about the rational and perfectly sensible answers for each of those point. Yes, charities are helpful and people should give to them. I’m not trying to convince anyone and I think that people who give are praiseworthy. But I just don’t want to be a part of it.

I have given some of my time to another charity later in my life and I’m not against giving money directly to homeless people (not everyone I cross on my road or else I would join them).

Except that I discovered that most people I know have one or two charities they give to and budget for it. When I told them I didn’t want to give money to charities they acted shocked, start arguing with me and made me feel like an asshole.

"AITA For not wanting to share a hotel room. A friend is getting married in another country and a bunch of our friends have been invited on the initial wedding invites. We're planning on going out for a week to make the most of the trip away.

The group is single guys, couples and those in a couple but are flying solo for the trip.

When it comes to the hotel the couples are rooming, and the single/solo people are joining up. There was three of us left and we were going to get a triple room but then I decided that I would just book up my own room and the other two could stay together.

A couple of reasons I want my own room is my health isn't the best and I've been in hospital and rather unwell a lot over the last year so I just want my own space when I go away as I sleep a lot during the day to recover from the night before and I need a good sleep during the night or I just don't operate the next day. I don't want anyone disturbing me.

The other reason is there's a 50% chance I won't make it if my health gets in the way. I'm prepared to write of the flight cost but I'm not going into sharing a room with someone then pulling out and having to pay my share. As it stands I've booked a room with a small deposit that I can cancel 48 hours before, the room is close to £700.

Onto the issue. Another friend has recently been invited and has heard I have a room to myself and has presumed they could share with me and I've had phone calls and constant whatsapp messages about sharing. I've been telling them my reasons (above) but it isn't getting through. They're also someone you DO NOT want to share with going from previous experiences that involve snoring, getting extremely drunk, spewing in the room and being a general overall mess. This guy is relentless and takes everything to heart.

If I don't share with them then they're also going to have to pay close to £700 for a room and it would probably become too much for them to go on this wedding trip. The general chat on the whatsapp group is they get my position but some are saying I should share so he can afford to go as well.

"AITA for refusing a (legal) marriage based on finances?. Should be ""are we the assholes"", but that's not how this sub is written. Also, I won't be naming genders in this to avoid unfair assumptions. 

My partner and I got married 3 years ago. A little bit before we got married, it came to light that my partner had a massive amount of debt (medical, student, and lawsuit based). There are valid reasons to this and it's not that they were irresponsible. Due to this, their credit score is garbage.  This is not something that could conceivably be paid off in a few decades even. It is in the hundreds of thousands. **If we had gotten legally married, we would be unable to ever afford to have children or even be able to rent an apartment on our own.** 

Now, I am not rich by any means, but I have always worked hard to stay debt free, maintain good credit, and am lucky enough to have no student loans. We had dreams for our lives and wanted to not ruin all of our chances, so we agreed to skip the legal portion of marriage for the time being. The social/religious aspect matters both to us and our families, but the legal aspect is rarely looked at too closely. 

We had a reasonable wedding and just... didn't sign a paper. We asked for a contribution for a down payment IF guests wanted to get us gifts (no registry or physical gifts). We called it a wedding because it is/was. 

We were able to buy a house with my credit (property is only in my name). We've been married for 3 years and just had our second child. We file taxes separately. We would never have been able to do this if we'd signed the papers. This wasn't any kind of issue until our second child was born and it came out that we didn't have a marriage license to give over at the hospital (obviously) and we had to sign a declaration of paternity. All hell has broken loose. 

Our phones have been blowing up about us ""having a fake wedding"", ""having children out of wedlock"", and ""making them support us living in sin"". Our relatives are furious with us. They are now referring to us as ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" and say that they don't know what to tell the children in the family about this or what to do on holidays (unmarried couples don't room together on family trips).

For those who are wondering the comments are ones that should properly be sent via PM like her mobile number or my personal favourite  when she commented on a photo that I took and tagged my entire drama (theatre) class in  and said “Oh hi lostmywaybackhome, Granny is flying over to see you now.”

As you can properly tell it’s a privacy issue, but it’s more than that.  It’s even worse when friends tag me in photos and she would respond so then my friends and family would see my aunt trying to be cool and hip by making “jokes”. One time she even posted her mobile number on a photo a friend of mine posted of me so everyone saw that.

But to make matters worse I would post something that I’m proud of (like passing all of my year 12 classes) and she would comment like “Oh you should check out my video about my horse”. Like she made everything about her and her horse. I showed a friend whose parents bred horses if she was using the correct technique and apparently she wasn’t.


I did ask her to be careful and to reduce the amount of comments because I found it weird. But she just laughed and said it wasn’t a big deal  which made me feel like I was somehow in the wrong.",NTA - there’s such a thing as *boundaries* and *over sharing* and your aunt is guilty for going beyond your boundaries and over sharing everything.

"AITA for refusing to go to my uncle's 50th birthday?. I (23F) come back home (to my grandparents) every year for christmas to spend time with the elders (I still have my great grandparents). 
I feel intense hatred towards my whole family but the elders, my uncle and the children. We are quite the large family since we seem to live long. There are topics everyone knows can't be talked about, such as war because my great grandfather  has strong PTSD. And my mother's BF because I have strong PTSD. 
While one is considered normal, in my case, my family strongly believe I'm a liar. I guess I couldn't walk properly from my 10yo to my 18 since ""she tripped in the stairs"" have been the excuse to my multiple broken bones. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. I won't go further, but only my grand parents and this uncle offered me shelter and helped me running away. Only they know where I live, my number and such. 

My uncle's birthday happens to be on Christmas eve, nothing new for me really, but this year my mother pretty much decided to throw him a surprise party since he will be 50. Everyone went along and I'm sure he will be happy. But I won't go. Dealing with this toxic environment is already hard enough, nothing new tho, but telling me my mother's BF will be attending is just too much. My mother came crying saying I should consider her feelings, threatening me to cancel everything if I didn't go and that it will hurt my uncle.

I can't see this end well and when it comes to her BF, my anger and hatred deepens. I couldn't reply in any mature way, I just started crying and screaming just like she does so it amounts to nothing. It's a poor show for my grandparents and I don't want to burden them. But I can't control myself when even his disgusting name is pronounced. I strongly feel like they are wrong to ask me to go, and that it will ruin my ongoing years of therapy, but in their eyes I exaggerate everything and time has passed. I know my grandparents feel this way because I can't be mature when talking about this. And crying has always been seen as weakness in my family.

"AITA for not making a three year old child move for an older gentleman?. Ok a little background. I am a nanny, and my charge is three. We were at the zoo all day, so it was a long day and he was tired when we got on the train. It was a bit crowded but there was one seat and he quickly took it. A little bit later an older gentleman with a cane got on and asked (let’s call him Zach) to move. I quickly called out the older gentleman as there were PLENTY of able bodied adults he could have asked to move, but instead he chose to ask three year old Zach. 
The gentleman got snippy with me and explained that I am responsible to teach him manners and that he should always move when an older person gets on the train. I don’t really have a problem with this premise. I HAVE in the past made him move for older people on the bus when there were literally no other seats available and he was the only young one. 
However in this situation there were clearly plenty of other seats this gentleman could have asked for. I explained that Zach is three years old, tired from a day at the zoo and not likely to remember this event for any length of time. That there were plenty of able bodied people he could have asked and it’s not HIS job to teach my charge life lessons!
He was very rude and adamant and I’m sure it would have turned into more drama had a nice young woman not gotten up and let the gentleman sit.

"AITA Because I don't want my husband's ex-wife at his 50th birthday party?. First a little back story:

My husband and I first started dating 10 years ago.

When we first me, he was in the process of divorcing his ex-wife for the 2nd time. I told him that I never wanted to be the ""2nd"" woman in a relationship, so I refused to date until his divorce was finalized. He came into work that day, dropped the completed divorce papers and asked if we could go out for wings and beer.

He was the first guy I ever dated (22 and **very** sheltered life), and things were going along pretty well. However, issues started happening when I went out to the west coast to help him get the last of his items from his former life out of storage. After we got the moving truck home and unpacked it, her stuff was every where....To the point that the first thing I would see when I walked through the door was a box with her framed picture on the top of it.

He refused to get rid of any of her stuff, insisting that he was going to send it to her. After dealing with it for a year (and a year of seeing her face every day when I would come home), I'd had enough. Called the fam, packed up my stuff, and moved out.

After a few months and a bad rebound bf, we ran into each other attending a gig of a mutual friend. Sparks re-kindled, and much to my family's dismay, we got back together. When we got back together, he made some serious promises, such as minimizing contact with his ex unless absolutely needed (they ran a business together and had unresolved tax issues from the dissolution of the business). Fast forward a few years and we're married and moving out to the west coast, while she's remarried with kids on the east coast.

Over the years, he's kept minimal contact, but over the last year they've become full blown best friends again. FB posts, chats, emails back and forth, and while I've tolerated it, we've been fighting over it more and more. To the point that during one argument I told him he broke his promise to me when we got back together.

Now, he's significantly older than me and is turning 50 this year. It's going to be a huge birthday bash for him, but he wants to invite his ex-wife. The one who I really do not ever want to meet face to face, and have told him so on multiple occasions. His reply is that it is his birthday and even though he expects me to organize it, he wants her to attend.

AITA for absolutely refusing to invite her and giving an ultimatum that if he wants her there then I will go visit my family instead?

&#x200B;

\*\*\*EDITING FOR ADDITIONAL INFO\*\*\* The kids his ex-wife has are hers only and with her current husband. They didn't come into the picture until after she remarried. She would be flying across the country to attend, and is contemplating leaving her husband with the kids so she can attend. I have walked in on him writing emails and FB messenger IM's between them that he will immediately close out when I enter the room. He leaves them logged in on the computer, but I haven't read them and I think it would be 100% a breach of all trust and a point of no return. I am working with a counselor to try and resolve my own insecurities, but he's refused to come to counseling at this point.

"WIBTA For cutting off contact with my mom over money?. So this is a throwaway because my family knows my main account and I’m not ready for this discussion with them right yet. If this is not allowed, please let me know/delete my post!

So when I was in high school, my family hit a pretty rough patch. I was working at a local store and because of this rough patch, my parents needed financial assistance. 

Right from when they first borrowed money, the deal was that it was to eventually be repaid, it was in fact “borrowing” and not me having to pay to live there. Most of the money went to hydro bills, rent, heat, food, etc. But, occasionally my parents would both spend money on things that weren’t necessities. 

After I left home and went to school, they stopped borrowing money. My mom hasn’t worked for a few years now, and lives on a pension. She’s fully capable of working but refuses to. My parents are going through a divorce, so nearly a year ago I told them that I expected the debt to be split evenly between them. I expected each of them to pay $3500, as all the money borrowed was used pretty evenly. We all agreed that was fair. I agreed that I wouldn’t be charging interest on the money borrowed, despite paying extremely high interest rates on the money I had to borrow to finish my education. We also made agreements on payment plans they could both afford, so that we knew there was both the ability to pay, and the expectation of regular payments being made. 

Since making that agreement, my dad has paid regularly. My mom hasn’t made a single payment, and any time I’ve mentioned to my parents that I had to miss out on a great opportunity because of my inability to afford it, my mom either ignored it or said something along the lines of “life sucks, if you really cared about it you’d be able to afford it”. 

This is especially frustrating as I’ve always had a better relationship with my mom than with my dad, and it’s starting to make me question my entire perception on who my parents were. 

This money has put a serious strain on my mental health and my relationship with my parents. I’m at a point now where I feel hopeless in salvaging the relationship with my mom and want to know if I would be the asshole if I took the plunge and severed relationships with her.

"AITA - Watched/let an employee implode after his performance review.. I am the supervisor of a guy who I never really connected with fully but we used to be friends. I met this guy last year when I moved in to the job and he was super negative and really mean with staff below him. I had a bit of trouble with him but we were getting by. His wife had a baby and he took half the year to be the primary care giver while his wife went back to work. His wife didn't go back to work and he admitted he hated the job so he just used the baby as an excuse to get out of it.

The next year he and I are in a new area. We set our own schedule, the workload is OK and I'm in charge of this guy again. He starts the year by asking if he can take one day a week off. We discuss it and decide that we can support this.

What actually happens is that this guy takes his one day off plus extra. The result is that the section of 3 is short staffed and this guy is only doing 2 or 3 day weeks.

He's still super negative and it's frustrating that - without fail - he pulls a sickie when the work peaks and in fact he openly giggles about it to us.

It's hard to address because we agreed to one day a week off and the other days are sick or carers days. I do a welfare check. I explain what absenteeism is and ask how can we help. He replied that it's his right to take leave all the time and doesn't see anything wrong.

Fast forward and it's end of year performance review time. I don't cruel him like I should, I write a good positive report with lots of things clearly unsaid. The report is not getting him moved up in the company any time soon but it is better than he deserved.

This guy asks why I didn't write him a high performing report and I explain off the record why. He wants to fast track to management so this just will not do. I hold my line and refuse to include the lies he wants me write. He appeals and calls me out in front of my bosses.

Ok. Gloves off.

I reply with specific examples that show what a shit bag he's been all year. The report is reviewed and the comments in the review essentially cut this guy's career off at the knees. He has the option to appeal higher but he knows what will happen so he pulls the mental health card. (He has done this twice before to get his way at work) Now he claims he does not feel safe at work and that I'm out to destroy his career. Remember this is a guy who has had issues all this year and last with being overly harsh on his junior staff.

The guy ends up having a well-being review in front of all the big bosses, removed from the area and made to sit with a junior manager until the end of the year until he was moved to a different division. I've never seen a more successful self sabotage in my life. He set his career back 5 years and destroyed his reputation in tragic fashion. So......

"WIBTA if I cut off a friend for never reaching out to me after my wife died?. I have a friend that I’ve known through work since 2010. We lost touch in 2012 until 2017 when he got my a job at my current company because I had been unemployed since 2015 taking care of my cancer stricken wife. (It’s the same company as before and he’s always worked there)

His wife and my wife were both immigrants and both without friends, so he got the idea of introducing them while we all went to dinner and they both hit it off pretty good. Both became really great friends and before I know it, my friend was at my house every weekend. 

My friend wound up getting a job in a different state in May so we would text here and there, and my wife and his wife continued to text/FaceTime everyday. 

My wife passed away in September, and I never heard from my friend or his wife since then. It’s been over two months and I’ve even had random strangers check up on me weekly since then but never him. This has built up a certain amount of resentment, hurt, and anger and it’s to the point I just want to completely cut them both off. 

Could I just talk to them first? I guess, but why? I’m the one in pain. Why do I have to beg someone to uphold their part of a mutual friendship?

"WIBTA if I reported my old coworker for breaking student/tutor contract and unapologetically posting on social media about it?. Background: I studied at a public (American) university, and was employed by the athletics department (D1, Conference USA *governed by the strict laws of the NCAA*) as a tutor to the athletes. This is peer-on-peer tutoring so we are all very similar in age, often have classes together, and may even have mutual friends. The athletes at my school are *awesome*. Like so funny and cool, and tutoring sessions were 50% bonding and 50% learning. I was so stoked to go to work every day, and stayed there for 3 years until I graduated (May 2019). 

SO—In our contract we have extremely strict rules about socializing with athletes. No contact outside of the office, no phone/email/social media exchanging. If you have class with them or knew them before getting the job, you are contractually obligated to disclose it so you are not tutoring them. We are fear mongered of terrifying legal stories about tutor-athlete friendships and contract breaking ago other universities for 2 hours in our annual training. Hopefully the ethical reasons for all of this is self-explanatory.

My fellow tutor (Sarah*) has been with the office for 2 years and *knows* this. Yet she studies in the library with students, goes out drinking with them, and posts all over social media about it. This girl is dumb, but like, she is definitely well-aware that this breaks contract and she could be fired if someone saw. Well, I follow her. And I’ve *been seeing*. It’s not surprising that she also breaks contract by making them study guides, printing copies of her old notes, and helping them with other classes (she tutors only 1 subject). 

This rubs me the wrong way because I would LOVE to be friends with these students. I would LOVE to get drinks with them and do normal college tomfoolery with them. I would LOVE to make them study guides to save them time and make sure they get a good grade. They’re awesome. I saw them at parties and just wave hi then leave (as instructed in training). I was a rule follower only because I loved my job and didn’t want to risk losing it. I was SO looking forward to following them on social media when I graduated (and did, like, right after I walked). So...it feels so unfair that she unapologetically is breaking rules and being friends with her students. Also, her over-helping is absolutely crossing a line and I’d be lying if I said students don’t take advantage of that (cheating using her study guides/old notes). 

Reddit-WIBTA if I reported her now that I don’t work there? I took a screenshot of one of her posts with a student. It just seems so wrong and isn’t going to help the students in the long run. 


TLDR: coworker breaks contract by hanging out with students outside of job with very strict rules on relationships. also overhelps as a tutor in ways that bypass student learning/development. I wanna report her

"AITA for not sharing my tax returns with an EX despite sharing a child?. Backstory: My ex and I split a little over a year ago after 4 years together and having a son. I was a stay at home father and she advanced her career until messy details and I was basically dumped and my mother moved to my state to save my son and I from being homeless. I got a part time job quick and got 9 grand in tax returns last year, 3.5 to my mom(did not pay rent for a year)  3.5 for my son and I with 2 grand for the mother who is helping with a couple hundred dollars a month. 

This year I have been keeping my son almost every  day with her keeping him Friday evening to Sunday morning. She makes more than twice what I make but contributes about $300-$500 a month (matching my childcare cost while I work with a little left over) which helps immeasurably. Next year I feel I should keep the tax returns. The tax break for claiming a child as a single parent is huge but I spend pretty much every dime on his enjoyment. At the same time his mother helps me under the table to make childcare payments. Am I an asshole for keeping the extra money?

"AITA for not always being cheerful around my mom?. So for a little background info, I am 16. I live with my mom and dad and attend high school and I would say my mom and I have a good relationship.

My mom is one of those ""a family does everything together families"" where she expects my sister (14) and I to go with her and my dad over to run errands like grocery shop or go to the mall over the weekend. Now I understand how its nice to do things with my family but most of the time I don't feel like running errands with my family every weekend. My mom sees this as a form of resentment and often times when I tell her I don't want to go she tells me that I'm being rude, or that I need to be more friendly or cheerful. Sometimes after recently seeing my cousins, my mom tells my sister and I that she wishes we were ""more like our cousins"" and that we aren't that friendly. I find this kind of hurtful since both my sister and I aren't that outgoing and my sister has recently been struggling to make friends at school. After school, I typically go home (my mom is already home by the time I arrive) and then I go into my room and close the door. My mom sees this as a form of being rude and unfriendly but often times I want to study without noise or call my friends or not be distracted by our dog and 90% of the time on weekdays we eat together as a family. A lot of the time, its not that I hate my mom or that I'm trying to be unfriendly its just that I'm tired or don't feel like talking.

Whats concerning to me is that I started noticing that my mom will intentionally bug me to try to get a negative reaction out of me to show that I am unfriendly. Today when I was sitting next to her she poked me in the side and said Hello. I said hello back since she expects me to be nice even though what she did (I thought) was annoying. I know I'm not crazy since in the past she has poked me (or similar which I think she's intentionally trying to ignore me) as when she gets upset at me she uses my reaction as an example of why I'm a bad son (or why I'm not friendly, etc).

"AITA for staying home for Christmas to take care of our animals?. Some backstory first.

Last year, my mom bought my ten year old sister a rabbit (his name is Mochi) for her birthday. It was great until it became apparent very quickly that I was the only one who even gave a rat's ass about him. My mom had wanted to get rid of him, which we've argued over multiple times because I know how many people get rabbits for pets and then return them when they find out they can't handle the responsibility. I didn't want that to be us. So now he is considered my responsibility. Mom will pay for his food and bedding, but I feed him, give him water, play with him, clean his cage, etc.

Anyways, this time last year, we took him with us up to my grandmother's for the holidays. We had to keep him in a pet carrier at night, which I don't think he was happy with. This year, the situation is different, and we cannot keep him where we did last year. Originally my mom wanted to leave him home, alone, for four days. I refused. Her other solution then was to put him in a large dog kennel on the back porch (EDIT: to clarify, it's indoors, but has no heating, so in the winter, it's just as cold in there as it is outside). I refused again. The back porch at my grandma's house can get freezing, dog kennels are not for rabbits, and last time we took the trip there and back, Mochi was clearly not happy in the car. Leaving him home was not an option, but taking him with us seemed like more trouble than it was worth to me, and stressful for him. So I decided that I would stay home with him and our other animals this year, to take care of them.

My family did not like this choice, to put it lightly. My mother told me I must care about the rabbit more than my family, that I'm going to break my grandmother's heart and make her feel like I don't love her anymore, that I never know if this could be my last Christmas with my family, and threatened to kick me out. When I stood my ground, she made me finish up dinner, closed herself off in her room and ignored me for the next few hours, and cried.

When I told my grandmother, she immediately started insisting that she NEEDED to see me. She tried to order me to bring the bunny, I stood firm. She then gave me an ""ok, whatever"", and then when I didn't respond, she came back with ""I see your mom is mad at you too. You better change your mind. She's been there for you your whole life, and you're pissing her off."" When I finally snapped and said that this was my choice, and to respect my choice, she left it with ""Nothing else to say..."".

I didn't want this. My entire family is angry with me now. I feel bad staying home, genuinely, but I don't want to stress out this animal that I am responsible for. I'm the only person in the house that even cares about Mochi. With me home, I won't have to worry about him, or our other animals (we have a lot). Additionally, I am an adult, and I feel that I should be allowed to choose to stay home for one holiday.

You're boyfriend's behavior is WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE. 

Even if he thinks he's coming from a nice, protective, boyfriend place, here's what he actually did: 

He decided that you were incapable of handling your own problems. He removed your ability to make decisions by taking this situation into his own, presumably violent, hands. -I say presumably violent, because really, what was he gonna do? Speak nicely to whoever? 

He threatened your livelihood. Most states are at will. If I'm your boss and your boyfriend starts calling your job, demanding anything at all, I'm going to think you asked him to, and I'd definitely call the cops and report him for harassment. If his behavior continued, first I'm going to make sure you're OK, but if you can't get it together, I'm firing you. No one needs this bullshit

He made you look weak and unstable. Seriously. His behavior is so far beyond the bounds of social conventions that I have to assume there's something significantly wrong with him mentally or intellectually, and you by association.

I happen to work in the same place as a close friend, for the first time ever I actually worked the same shift with her. The manager told her to take lead of the grilling area, I personally think she let it get to her head. She particularly bossed a specific teen around most of the night, the teenager hardly complied because the teen is cross trained for all positions of the store, her purpose was to go anywhere when needed. shes also been working there longer and knows more about how the restaurant works. My friend gave her ridiculous amounts of tasks to do, not all of which could be done. At one point my friend told her to go back and do dishes while she was in the middle of helping the drive thru window, of course the teen didn’t comply because she was busy. I told the teen it wasn’t a big deal and that I would do the dishes, I go back to the dish pit and there were no dishes to be done. I think maybe my friend doesn’t like that a teenager knows more than her?

My friend asked her to run back to the freezers and grab food many times, stuff that I was able to do myself as well but she didn’t ask me. I did anyway because I feel like the teen was being treated unfairly.

"AITA for continuing to talk to my dad?. I am sorry for poor English, I will do my best. I will explain this the best, even though it will be a little hard since it is a bit difficult for me to put into words. 

My parents got divorced when I was little. It was really nasty. A lot, more than I can put into words, happened. However, to this day, I still talk to him. We do not live together. We do not talk about extremely personal things, it is generally small talk in texts. I barely see him in person. Anyway, my mom is not happy about this. She claims that our conversations abuse her. He does not pay for child support but I still choose to communicate with him. We were on the phone for a while, and my mom came home and was not happy about the fact we were talking on the phone. She is pissed that he has done so much to hurt her/the family and I still choose to communicate with him, despite all he’s done. My mom claims through me, he is manipulating her. She is really not happy about the fact that we are communicating. According to her, two days ago they were cussing each other out, and now she comes home and I am on the phone having casual conversations with him. She is very much not okay with this.

"AITA for arguing with my in-laws about my sons name?. My husband and I have a 5 year old boy (R) who is named after my father, who died when I was 14. His middle name (C) is after my MIL's father, and he has my husband's (therefore FIL's) surname. 

My FIL is known exclusively by his middle name, as was his uncle who raised him, but my husband has always been called by his first name.  When my son was a baby my FIL started calling him by his middle name. I asked him to stop, and told him how important the name was to me. FIL then said that he would always be known as C to him. I told him, mostly jokingly, that if he kept calling R that, then I would change his surname to my maiden name. Everyone laughed. 

Since then however, both MIL and FIL refer to him as C, but not around me, only around my husband. R doesn't like it, and has told them C is not his name.  My husband has asked them to stop, but there is a pretty strained relationship there so he's reluctant to rock the boat. In Christmas and Birthday cards they only ever write ""To our grandson.""

Today the in-laws had come round for a visit, and just as they were getting up to leave FIL called my son C in front of me. I said ""who?"" very loudly, but FIL just walked off to the car. MIL had missed it, but could see I was upset and asked what was wrong. I told her and said that I thought it was incredibly disrespectful. I did swear a few times, but then apologised and explained it was just because I was so angry. She was not impressed, she told me that I was being ridiculous and that it wasn't important. I that it was to me, and that if it wasn't important to them, then they should call him by his given name.  FIL had then come back to see what was happening, and MIL was laughing when she told him that he'd upset me. He also laughed and said ""story of my life"" before going back to the car. 

My husband understands how angry I am, but doesn't think the fight is worth it. He's right in that we can't change them, but my current attitude is that if they can't call him R then they don't see him. There is very little positive interaction between them generally anyway, when we're around them they tend to ignore us and just argue with each other. I'm also not going to go into the racist, bigoted, Brexit-voting views they have discussed in front of my son in the past.

Am I being ridiculous? It is just a name really, and everyone else who matters calls him R. Luckily he was playing at the end of the garden so didn't hear any of it, but he's picked up that I'm angry, and keeps giving me lovely cuddles.","NTA, especially since _the child himself_ doesn't like it.

"AITA for moving back to my spot in the concert?. Obligatory 'on mobile' warning, I guess.

So my mates and I went to a concert tonight. It was an average sized concert, filling a large theatre in our city. All of my friends are short or of average size. I am not. I'm about 6'4, and pretty big across my shoulders.

We got to the concert a little later than we should have,  and had to get in line all the way around the block, so, when we get in there, we're maybe a third or half of the theatre away from the stage. It's pretty packed as well. We stand through the opening acts, and there's a bit of time between the second act and the headliner, and my mate sees this as an opportunity to head to the bathroom. He asks me if I'll come with him, as he's worried about not being able to see where all of our friends are when he comes back. So I tell the people in my immediate vicinity that I'm leaving, but I'll be back, just so I don't surprise anyone by wanting my spot back.

We go to the toilet, and get back into the theater proper. The main act hasn't started yet, so we hustle back down to the standing area. As I'm moving through the crowd, I'm giving little apologies, or asking people to bunch up for a second as I move through. We're just about back to where we left our friends, and I say to the person I was moving past, 'Sorry brother, I've just gotta slip through here to get back to my mates.'

As I'm moving past, he says 'Well, you don't really have to get back there do you?'

I kept moving and said, 'Yeah, I kinda do. All my friends are here. I just went to the toilet.'

To which he replied, 'You're one of the biggest people in here and you left. You lost your spot and should've stayed in the back.'

I laughed and got to my spot and enjoyed the concert. He would have been behind me before I left, but after I got back, he loudly complained about not being able to see. I tried slouching a little, but I don't think it really would have made a difference.

"AITA for thinking my brother and sister should be allowed to spend time together?. Okay this is on mobile, I just need a basic ruling and some advice. 

My little sister (11)
My older brother (26)
My sister in law (25)
Me (19f)

So my little sister wants to spend time with my older brother. Since she was born they’ve had a really close bond so that’s not unusual. It’s not something out of the blue. They used to do it when she was a lot younger. 

She wants to go see a movie, go to dinner, or really anything. The problem is that she basically just wants it to be just her and my brother. It also doesn’t have to be often either, the kid would be fine if it was just once a year. They haven’t done it in years and honestly before you know it she’s gonna be a teenager and not want to spend any time with all of us. 

My sister in law says it would excluding her and used this as an example, “What if in 5 years **** and I have a family and told her she couldn’t be involved.”  She also claims my little sister is being vindictive and/or wanting to see our older brother as a father figure. 

For a little back story: Our dad is terminally ill and can’t do basic things with her, our mom is his full time caregiver. He’s also in a wheelchair. 

My opinion is who is it actually hurting for an 11 year old and her older brother to spend some sibling time? I could be biased because I am one of the siblings but I don’t see the harm in my brother setting aside an hour or two every 6 months to a year, to spend time with our little sister. 

Especially because she has had it so rough for her entire life that she honestly just needs a win. This whole situation makes her cry at least 4 times a week and she doesn’t understand why he won’t do it anymore.

"AITA for wearing an ugly shirt to meet my girlfriend's parents?. My twin brother and I are, for the most part, fairly mature, reasonable adults, and productive members of society, but something about each other brings out the Cain instinct.

Every time there's a birthday or Christmas we all gather in one place and for a few years my brother and I have had an ongoing competition to buy the ugliest possible shirts for each other. So far the ugliest shirt I've given him is a hawiian shirt decorated with cats in tacos and the ugliest he's given me looks exactly like a bowling alley carpet.

We've never worn the shirts before now, but the last time he gave me a shirt (Nigel Thornberry as Miley Cyrus) I managed to cough while drinking and spilled coffee on the shirt I went out in. My brother told me to go put on the shirt he bought me to replace it. I went to the bathroom and put it on, and wore it until I got home.

A few nights later I went to meet my brother for drinks and he was wearing the taco cat shirt. I saw this as a challenge, and since then we've both started to wear the ugly shirts when we see each other. Our girlfriends are amazing enough that not only have they accepted this, but they join in.

It didn't cause issues until last night. My girlfriend and I are in her home country (Ireland) for a week, and in I'm meeting her parents for the first time.

My brother offered to give me a lift to the airport and because he was involved, I wore a shirt he got me with the main character of Bee Movie on it.

At some point during our flight her parents decided to meet us at the airport instead, which we didn't see as we were on the plane. We got out of the airport and she immediately saw her parents and told me to put my jacket on. My zip got stuck so I was left staring down my girlfriend's parents with barry fucking benson on my chest.

I tried to explain the game with my brother, playing it off as a joke, but they just drove us to the hotel silently and then went away. They're coming back in the morning. My girlfriend said that while I was checking in they told her that just from this interaction they knew we weren't a good match.

My girlfriend is upset with me, but only a little. She said that if she'd known that was the shirt I was wearing on leaving the flat, she'd have told me to leave it at home, but also feels like I should have known not to bring it along. She says I was the one who said that I wanted to make a good impression on her parents, and I should have known that this was not the time or place for the ugly shirt competition. I don't disagree with any of that, but the way I see it I have a week to fix this and I only anticipated her and my brother seeing the shirt. If I'd known her parents would be there I would have changed. She still says that even though she believes me, on the way to the airport to meet her parents is still not the time or place for the ugly shirt game.

"AITA for not wanting to eat with my friend who likely has an ED?. I (22F) have a same-age friend (22F) in college. She's a great friend in many ways - outgoing, bright, and caring.

My friend has a history of ED (eating disorder), and based on what she described, I think she suffered from bulimia. She also mentioned that she still occasionally binge eats at night but that it wasn't serious. I don't judge her at all for it, and was just happy that she trusted me enough to confide in me.

Now, the problem I have is the stuff she says and does when we're eating together. We frequently have meals together at our university cafeteria. Recently, she's been getting a salad for every meal and compares it to what I eat (usually some bread, soup, meat, rice - I like diversity), saying things like, ""You eat so little!"", ""Look how HUGE my salad is compared to your food!"", or ""You should eat more like me, I'm so stuffed!"" Granted, her salads are pretty big and fills up her entire plate so visually they do look 'bigger' than my food. However, her meal is basically just a ton of lettuce and veggies with no dressing - I can't imagine it being more filling than what I eat. 

My frustration hit a peak yesterday when we dined out for dinner. Again, she ordered a salad while I got a steak gyro. I wasn't really that hungry so I ate half and packed up the remaining to eat later. As soon as I asked for a box, my friend made this shocked expression and said loudly, ""Why aren't you eating more?? You hardly ate anything, girl!"" I was kind of embarrassed and told her that I was full to which she said, 'Yeah right, you ate so little! I'm really worried about you.""

Tbh, I felt (and still feel) so annoyed by that. My friend is around the same weight, if not thinner than me so I don't know she feels the need to constantly judge the size of my meals and feel 'worried' that I'm not eating enough for her standards; after all, without wanting to sound insensitive, I'm not the one with a history of ED!

It's gotten to the point where I feel strangely guilty if I don't eat a lot in front her. I hate stuffing myself, but I make an effort to clean off my plate every time I dine with her just so that she won't nag me to eat more.

I'm tempted to just not eat with her anymore, though we'd still hang out in other ways. I'm also tempted to say something like, ""Your salad really isn't more filling than my meal. If anything, you should be the one to eat more"" to her the next time she compares our food. Would I be TA if I said that?

At the same time, I feel like I should be more sympathetic towards her because her actions suggest that she's still suffering from ED, though she hasn't explicitly said anything. I don't want to say anything potentially hurtful or triggering to her.

tltr: Friend who likely has an ED makes annoying comments about how little I eat compared to her (when the opposite is true) and implies that I'm lying when I tell her that I'm full - AITA for not wanting to eat with her anymore and not sympathizing enough?","NTA-

I am on my junior year of bachelor of architecture. I have one close friend in my class and we are giving High-Rise Buildings course together but he is not interested with it at all. This course has no exam but three projects and professor has matched students at first project so my friend came and said ""Let's do it together"", I said ""no problem"" but he did nothing and left everything to me about first project. It wasn't problem at the first sight because I loved the course and already made everything without him. 

He came to me when the professor gave subjects of the second project and everything was the same with first project, he did nothing, I made everything and he said ""Can you share with me?"" I said ""Uh, okay."" because I've already made everything. But after all it was getting on my nerve because he had same grades with me with doing nothing.

At third and the last project, he came again and I said ""We can do it together but I need you to promise me you will make something because we are coming to end of the semester and this project is hard, I can't do it all by myself."" of course he said ""I promise I will help to you."" I went to him when I need help but nothing changed and he said ""Sorry, you know I'm not interested with this course so I don't know anything, I can't help to you."" so I said ""Okay then, I won't share my project with you because I made every single thing on it.""

"AITA For wanting some alone time on New Years Eve?. Im on mobile so please forgive typos and formatting.

I’m a 15 year old male, and I’m an introvert. I struggle with depression and anxiety. My parents know this and we went to get help, which i greatly appreciate. I still struggle with it but my parents think im better because a while back i caught a break but it quickly returned. My parents are very outgoing and invite a lot of people over and this makes me very anxious,
they know this but refuse to tell me when they are inviting people over. So when they do i am forced to be stressed and talk to my parents friends, who arent bad people, but i still get stressed. My parents have insisted for months now that there is something wrong with me not wanting to be with people, but i just tell them that its nothing personal. 

We have been traveling all around to see family. I havent been able to catch a moment alone, i told my parents this but they didnt really seem to care so ive just been really stressed. Tonight was New Years Eve. I wanted some alone time but we had to go out with family friends for the night. I brung my book, because i wanted a way to escape without being on my phone. When we got there we talked for about 20 minutes, and when conversation slowed down i pulled out my book. I started reading, and talked a little every once in a while. 

After about 20 or 30 minutes of reading my book my mom said “Hey Op, can we talk for a second.” I said sure. She pulled me away from the table and said “Op youre being really rude right now, i need you to make more of effort.” 

I said “Ive been making a large effort this whole vacation, and its not like im not talking.”

She said “Youre being really selfish right now, I need you to stop.” 

I insisted one more time “I think im being fine, they dont really seem to mind honestly.”

She said “Thats it, im calling an uber and you can go home.”

"AITA for releasing almost 10 years of emotional baggage on my best friend after a shit day at work?. So to clarify I'm an 18 year old guy who never had a girlfriend and probably never will and after my prom that happened on friday I was (and still am)feeling super depressed because I got to see almost everyone else together and it just kinda hit me how bad it is to be single. That feeling kinda lingered on throughout the night and lasted pretty much all day today, so after work which was a fucking disaster because it's a retail job on mother's day eve, I was at the point where I could almost cry (which to clarify is something I almost never do) and I figured my best bet to not loose it was to just talk to my best friend who I've had some intense intimate conversations with in the past. Long story short I talked to her for much longer than anticipated and let loose lots more personal skeletons in the closet than the original ""I'm feeling bad about being single"" plan (dad's death, time spent in foster care, almost in poverty, mom's cancer coming back, ect. I've had a pretty fucked up life). I mean to be fair after being able to actually talk to someone about all my shit felt really good, but I'm feeling like it was such a fuckin dick move to put all this emotional trauma on her at like 10 o'clock especially considering that shes the only person my age thay I've ever told this crap to it really makes me feel like a dick because I could have just as easily went to go see a therapist or something and not put her through hearing all this negative crap.

"AITA for telling my best friend that her buying a house with her boyfriend(?) is incredibly stupid?. \*All parties here are 27

For the past 2 years, my best friend of 15 years has know this guy (Travis) for about 3 years. They live 4.5 hours from one another. and saw each other a total of three times. They would talk for a few months, then not hear anything from one another for several months. He lives with his parents, has no money saved, horrible credit, is focused on his mediocre band more than a career, lived a partying lifestyle complete with a drug/alcohol problem. He would go days without talking to her. He would constantly blow off plans with her, go days without responding to her, would string her along while refusing to put a title on the relationship even though he had ""never felt like this about anyone before"". He admitted to hooking up with other girls and once stopped talking to her because he got an actual girlfriend. In the first 2 years, they saw each other three times.

A few months ago, after his forced sobriety thanks to a DUI/testing positive for cocaine and having weekly drug tests, he realizes he fucked up and wants her back, tells her he's a changed man. She gives in and visits him a handful of times. They still do not have a ""title"" on their relationship because she ""doesn't know him well enough yet"", but she plans to rent an apartment near him. She wants to move at the end of August. This weekend, she told me that Travis is doing work on a house where the owner offered to sell him the house for $120k once the renovations are finished. They agree she move out in September when they purchase the finished house. She said she ""already has the down payment"" saved (...$4,000). I asked her if she thought it was a good idea to buy a house with a guy she didn't know well enough to call her boyfriend. She said she knows it's not traditional, but she has 100% confidence he changed. I told her that buying a house with him was incredibly stupid, as they have hardly spent time together, he has a horrible track record, is completely unreliable, he has no money saved/doesn't make good money. She is going to spend every penny she has on this down payment alone(which isn't even enough to begin with) for a house with a guy that has never once committed to her in the three years she's known him. She said that he is a different person and he even spent a lot of money on her for her birthday! I said that buying birthday presents is not indicative of your ability to commit to something as serious as buying a house with that person and that I didn't think she realized how serious this is. She asked why I couldn't just be happy for her and that she has always supported me. She then said she would talk to me about it later because I was ruining her weekend with him.

"AITA for deciding to go to a New Years party?. Backstory: In 2017 I had a thing with a guy I’ll call Clyde. We never dated, never kissed, never had sex, it was a very innocent friendship where we liked each other but never acted on it. In 2018 I began dating this guy I’ll call James. He and Clyde are best friends and James has been previously jealous of Clyde and myself liking each other as they’re best friends. 

James and i have been dating for a year. We spent New Years together last year and we went to the city with 2 of our friends. This year, James, Clyde and a few other of their guy friends decided to take a camping trip for NY which got cancelled as one of the boys went overseas. It was meant to be a boys only trip but somehow I got invited and James got a bit mad/weird about it. Then Clyde made an event for a NY party and I was invited, And I’m the only girl invited (that I know of. The other guys might have +1 their gfs but idk if they definitely have). James had his heart set on this New Years party being an all guys thing and I think he got a bit mad at me for deciding to go. I rarely ever get to do something special for NY so when I was invited I was really excited. I also asked James if he wanted me to drive us or if he wanted to and he said for us to drive to Clyde’s separately. AITA for deciding to go, when I got an invite?

Edit: sorry I forgot to mention, Clyde and I are still really close friends (not exactly best friend but close to it) but neither of us are into each other anymore. He’s moved on and so have I (he’s going on dates with this girl he’s really into, he’s definitely not into me anymore). James is just scared we will end up liking each other again. Clyde and I have had a discussion back in 2018 before I started dating James about staying mutual friends and that nothing will ever happen between us again, we’ve set those boundaries and as I’m close friends with him, that’s why I was invited. We also have a couple mutual friends who are going to the party (also guys) and so it’s like a little group meet up as well because we haven’t all seen each other in ages.

Edit 2: also Clyde was the one who got James and myself together, he definitely doesn’t have any malicious intent either

"AITA for thinking my neighbor's laundry requests are excessive?. I live in the basement apartment of a building with 3 other units, and I've been there 6 years. Never had a problem with others regarding laundry. If someone else's stuff is done when you go to toss your stuff in, put it in a pile on a large clean shelf we have between the washer and dryer. No problem.

I have a friend who is between permanent residences right now and stays with me a lot. He was doing a load of our combined laundry, and when he went to remove it from the washing machine at about 12:45 AM, someone else's stuff was in the dryer though the cycle was complete. He took the stuff out, put ours in, started up the dryer. Same old same old.

5-10 minutes later (while I wasn't dressed and was in the bathroom), a loud knock came from the back door. I certainly was in no position to answer. A few seconds later, another, more aggressive knock.

My friend threw on a shirt and shorts and opened the door. An apparently angry neighbor who has lived there for a few months said that since the load of laundry he took out was still a bit damp, she should have had dibs on the machine to use it again before we did.

I disagree. The only time the laundry is still damp after the 1 hour dry cycle is if it was overloaded or consisted of something very heavy like towels. (Friend confirmed it was overloaded.) You pay $1 to wash, takes about 30 min, and $1 to dry, takes about an hour. If your stuff isn't as dry as you like because of the way you decided to load the machines, you can a) hang them to dry that last bit b) throw them back in if no one is waiting or c) get back in line and wait your turn again. Yes I've been in that position before, and never had a problem with someone else taking my stuff out if I'm not right there to get it and they are, and putting their stuff in. I certainly wouldn't start banging on people's doors at 1 AM over it.

She told him that if this happens again she would like us to text her to let her know her stuff is ""done"" but not completely dry, and/or wait about 30 minutes to see if she'll come back to run them through again. My friend just agreed to everything, took down her number etc, to avoid confrontation and get rid of her (again, 1 AM, had work in a few hours) despite me having exited the bathroom at this point and, having heard what was going on, saying loudly in the background ""what are you agreeing to?! I'm not doing any of that. You're not always here, I am"" to no avail.

Am I wrong for thinking that she is being unreasonable in this? Your laundry is not our group effort and we all would like to be done ASAP. Don't overload the machine, and if you choose to anyway why am I obligated to wait until you decide you're done? I've worked laundry in with families of 6 and never had a single issue, this is nuts in my opinion. AITA?","NTA. She's being ridiculous.

"AITA for telling my family to F*** off.. I have been back in my home town for almost 4 years after being gone for 5 years. 

Since I’ve been back in town family requested my schedule. I am I very organized person, I have a detailed written calendar and that’s the way I prefer to see my schedule. 

Upon their request I set everyone up in a shared google calendar where we would ALL post ANYTHING to do with our schedule. 

Very early on I was the only one to post anything. 
I post my work schedule, my workout schedule , if I planned to eat out with friends, all doctor appointments. And if I failed to do so for one week everyone would freak out. 

For the past 3-4 years when anything would be happening to anyone else I would be the very last to know. Examples 

""Sister is coming to town today and we've  known about it for weeks”

""My mother has a 20th anniversary party at work that's been planned for 6 months can you please come? It's tomorrow"" 

And I always get the guilt trip “Well surely that can let you off for this one thing, it’s ~FAMILLLLY~”

I am the manager of my department. I always make the schedule for a full month, two weeks before the start of the month. So everyone (including me) won’t have any surprises in the schedule. I ask everyone for “special requests off” and 9/10 everyone gets their request

Everyone wants to know my every fucking move, but shit that has been planned for months or weeks.  I only get told the week or day of, and everyone gets upset when I can't ask off when I make the schedule A MONTH in advance. Since no one wants to tell me their schedule no one gets to know mine. 
The fact that literally every one knew that Uncle would be in town when he one shows up once every 5 years and I hear about it THE DAY he's coming into town. Is absolutely ridiculous. And this happens ALL THE FUCKING TIME. I’ve mentioned this for the past 4 years and still no one wants to include me in plans, I’m over it. 
Get in my shoes two for minutes and see how frustrating that is”

Also, I usually don’t cuss at my family, but this has been building for years and very politely mentioned several times before.

Most people are agreeing with me and hours later after I’m not still mad about it. I feel like shit for cussing at my parents/grandmother. Literally not a usual thing, and I agree with you guys. Sent this just now. 


Though I do stand by what I said I regret the way I said it. I was mad and should have taken time to cool off before messaging. 
But it still stands that no one has told me anything until last minute for, forever and expects me to drop plans.  
I just honestly don’t understand how everyone knows things for weeks or months and I find out about it so late but if I don’t post my schedule for everyone to see immediately it’s a huge problem and I’m constantly asked about what’s going on or when it's going to be posted. 
I don’t mind sharing my schedule that’s not the problem. The problem is I’m the only one who’s expected to do so.  Everyone should be held to the same standard if we have a ""shared schedule"". When we get together on Thursday I will be happy to go over the calendar to show you how to post on it, if it is a technical problem.

My mother is planning is on visiting me in 2 months with my infant half-sister. I’m looking forward to her visit, however, my mother is making it one of her conditions of her visit that I host two of her friends as well. I don’t know these friends and my mother has only known them for maybe a year. 

I have issues with this because: I don’t feel comfortable leaving strangers alone in my flat while I’m gone for the day (I have work and university), Sam is uncomfortable with strangers in the flat, I don’t have extra keys, Sam and I enjoy our privacy, and there’s also very little space (these friends would need to stay on my sofa).

FYI this is norwegian high school senior year

We had P.E. and played volleyball and dodgeball afterwards.

Volleyball:
The gym had 2 courts and we were on different courts. In the middle of our game he kicked their volleyball towards us and it hit me. I think his team lost a point or something and he decided to kick it. It was hard, but nothing i couldnt handle. But when i looked over to see who shot/kicked the ball i saw him smiling/smirking. He didnt apologize just kinda smiled/laughed for himself. I decided to let it go.

Dodgeball:
We played on opposite teams, in «norwegian dodgeball» when you get hit. You go behind enemy lines. In a little area where you can shoot the enemy team and if you do, you get back in the game.

Somebody hit Stone, and he went behind us. Their team threw a ball to those who were hit, and Stone caught it. I was standing close as i were trying to catch it, and i plundered it right in my face. And he laughed for a little while. And hitting me in the face didnt do anything good for him, as if you get hit in the head. You dont get outed.

Then this happened AGAIN. I didnt say anything, but started to get mad. Accidents happen i know that, but laughter instead of an apology gets on my nerves.

When the period was over, i spoke very little. I was getting my things, and i think he noticed my anger/displeasement. And he asked if i was okay. And then is when i said to him «I don’t know Stone, either your aim is bad or you are just a bad person». AITA?

So I never get to see my extended family (grandma, cousins, aunts and uncles). I miss pretty much all the birthdays and get togethers. I do see my parents and brother all the time because they spend a ton of time at the ice cream shop with me.

We close for 1.5 months in the winter (January to mid February) where we rest and finally get to enjoy a little bit of life with my parents and my brother and visit my husband’s family. This time is a very important time for me.

Last year, in January, I hosted a birthday for my cousin’s baby boy. We had over 50 people at the ice cream shop and I, with my husband, pretty much served everyone. I ended up getting a pretty nasty cold two days later (there were various people sick at the party). The cold took me out for ten days, where I just stayed home. Then because my immune system was low from fighting that cold, I caught another one after two weeks of being okay. So I basically spent half of my vacation time sick in bed. It really sucked.

Fast forward to this year.

Two and a half weeks ago, my mom went to visit my grandma and they were all sick at her house. My mom ended up catching what sounds like the flu which turned into bronchitis. She has been very sick for two weeks which meant I didn’t get to see my mom most of January. This really sucks because it’s the only time I can spend with them.

This weekend, my cousin is having a birthday party for her son. I know at least two of them are sick with the same virus my mom got (it’s been spreading around the family). 

I’ve told my mom that I don’t want to go because :

1. She was sick for over two weeks with that virus which turned into bronchitis. And it ruined part of my vacation time because I couldn’t see her.
2. I was sick for over a month last year which ruined my vacation time.
3. I have three weeks left before I head back to work and I don’t want to spend them sick in bed.

The thing is, I know my family (uncles, cousins, aunts, grandma, etc) are all mad at me because I don’t want to go. It doesn’t help that I saw very little of them all of last year due to work. Also, my mom was upset at her brother in December (long story) so we skipped Christmas with them. It makes me feel like I’m being selfish and I do feel bad about it.

"AITA for being hurt that my girlfriend (accidentally) made plans on the day that i move to her city?. Obligatory backstory: I absolutely love this girl. I can easily see myself marrying hey some day. For almost a year we've been doing long distance and talked everyday about how I wish I was there with her. Fast forward I'm making it happen.

"AITA for Convincing my Bro to Dump his Girlfriend?. I (21 M) was at a club with my buddies and their girlfriends. Some of the guys and girls with us were single. We're having a fun time when a bunch of random guys invite some of the girls to dance. Most of them said no, including the girls with boyfriends, but a few of the single girls left to the dance floor. Notable exception being my best friend's girlfriend, who just leaves him and goes dancing with the random dudes.

Later, the guys and girls come back and say they're heading out to a party and ask if anyone wants to join them. Most of the remaining single girls get up to go, and my best friend (the 'Bro') looks at his girlfriend but neither say anything. I feel so bad for the guy so I say, ""Alright! Let's go!""

The random dudes didn't look that happy that I invited myself along, but one of the single girls says, ""Nooooo! Girls only!""

I look at the other girls (the ones with boyfriends) and say, ""Anyone else feel like going?"" They just politely decline. So the single girls go, including Bro's GF, and he's just sitting there not saying anything. I feel bad for him so I buy him drinks and tell him he's not staying sober tonight.

Later that night, he's looking quiet and moody. I ask him what's wrong and he says he can't believe his GF just left with random strangers. Apparently he's been texting her and she responded with saying he's being too insecure and jealous, and that he's being controlling and manipulative. He gets mad in the texts and she just ignores him.

I point my Bro to the other couples and say, ""Do you want what they have, or what you have?"" He wants what they have, so I say, ""Then find a girl like them, and dump the one you have! SIMPLE!""

\-----

Next week, we're together again on campus, and Bro's GF (ex-GF now but we didn't know yet - Bro didn't tell us and he wasn't present here) shows up and starts trashing me, saying I should mind my own business and that I was responsible for their break-up. She's crying and saying I ruined their perfect relationship and that's why girls don't like me (I'm single). The other single girls, upon hearing this, join in and starting insulting me. The couples don't say anything but they are looking awkward as hell. I say ""Good guys are looking for good girls. Good girls don't ditch their boyfriend to go party with complete strangers in the middle of the night. WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THIS?"" This just makes them more hysterical and we're causing a huge scene so I just silently apologize to the couples there, and I leave.

As far as I know, no cheating ever occurred, and other than this incident, I've never witnessed nor heard of Bro's ex-GF being cruel or mistreating him in any way. This was the only thing prompted me to convince my Bro to dump his GF.

"AITA for going on a date (and planning for more, two weeks after the end of a very serous, lengthy relationship?. So two weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were fighting and we just about broke up. He usually complained about how I was boring to him and that he talked and flirted with other girls because I wasn't always interesting or satisfying to him. We had been together for about two years however we were aquatinted for about four. My friend came up to me and told me she found him on tinder and I called him up crying and just completely confused on why he continued to hurt me and not reciprocate my care and empathy. The next day, a Saturday, he went to the bar and met up with me and a few friends at a small party we were having. At about 3:00am we got tired so we went to sleep, but I woke up half an hour later and he wasn't there. I struggled to get decent to see where he was and he was outside with my friend and they were ""cleaning"" together, he came back to bed and said ""I'm sorry, I promise I'll never let you go again"". I found out the next day he cheated on me. It was really tough at first, but he blamed and continues to blame me for everything, even though I practically spoon fed him and catered to his every need the entire relationship. Not to mention this is not the only time he's cheated on me. He was saying he wouldn't have done it if I didn't bore him etc, like we were planning our trip to Cuba and he did this. So a few days ago I decided to make a Tinder account just to meet some new people, no intentions of sleeping around or anything like that. Whenever he (the ex boyfriend) sees me, he looks over my shoulder at what I'm doing and who I'm talking to,  like he'll LITERALLY read my texts, I believe that he's been in a few of my accounts, and now he's like ""Oh how's tinder boy"" ""so I talked to SO many girls last night"" . 
I'm just trying to move on and find my happiness again after I lost so much, and now he's acting all jealous.
I went on a date with the guy I met on Tinder and he was the nicest human I have ever met, he asked me what my favourite flowers are (ex never bought me flowers) we planned a few more dates (ex and I never really went on dates)

"AITA for continuing my relationship with my sister-in-law's half sister?. Two things; firstly, this is more of are we the assholes. Secondly, I'm using a throwaway account because some of my friends know my main account.

Too give some background on the situation, I (M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (F) for a little over 7 months. We met on an online dating app, and everything in our relationship seems perfect. However, we recently found out that she is my sister-in-law's half-sister.

I wasn't able to attend my brother's wedding due to being overseas at the time, but I have met his wife (my sister-in-law) several times, but I've never met her family. My GF and her half-sister have different fathers which is why neither of us suspected this. My GF knew I had the same lastname as her half-sister's husband, but we have a common name anyway.

Anyway the incident went something like this, her mother wanted to get a ton of people together for dinner, so we went, my brother and his wife walked in, we saw eachother and it instantly clicked in my head. There was a lot of screaming, but my GF and I found it funny more than anything else, we eventually had to leave as everyone was freaking out.

The next day I received a text from my brother asking when we were going to break up, I thought he was joking, he wasn't.

It snowed heavily last night and when we were on the interstate this morning there was still a lot of slush. On unplowed neighborhood roads, there was a lot of snow and it took him a lot longer to stop than he expected. Like, he ended up in the middle of the intersection on a four way stop (fortunately no other cars around)

It's pretty well known in my group that I have anxiety about cars and traffic. In these road conditions, we could see cars that had slipped on turns and ended up in the middle of the opposing lane and stuff, so I was already concerned and on edge. Visibility was poor. 

I really try not to overly backseat drive, but I saw that we were whizzing past cars in the right lane (did you know that cars going significantly different speeds is a leading cause of fatal accidents?) and I glanced at the speedometer (I was in the seat behind him, not the passengers seat) and found that he was going just over 90mph. In those conditions. Very illegal, very dangerous.

"AITA For reclining my seat on a 10 hour flight?. Sorry for mistakes, I’m on mobile. Feel free to correct any. 

Ok so in short, I was on a 10 hour flight from Tokyo to Vancouver in economy class, I’m a average sized 5’9” 14 year old  so I generally don’t take up a lot of space but it was a 10 hour flight and I just wanted to get some sleep.

As soon as the flight took off and the seat belt sign was switched off I reclined my seat back as everyone else was doing but as soon as I do, the guy behind kicked he seat! I immediately thought this guy tall ass man and needed some leg room so I recline forward. As dinner came, I reclined forward so I can enjoy my lasagna but when I’m done I recline back and he kicks again!

As the flight continues there is the occasional thump which was annoying and woke me up several times but I’m extremely shy and introverted so I let it go. 

Whenever I get up to use the restroom this dude gave me the filthiest looks, almost as if I’m causing him extreme pain but then I notice, he doesn’t have his seat reclined at all and has his legs are together and pushed up against the seat he so he was almost giving himself no legroom! He could have just spread his les wider so they wouldn’t be touching the seat! 

One time when I went to the bathroom, he somehow managed to get my seat back to its original position and for about 2 hours his legs were crossed so I couldn’t recline it even a centimetre. I eventually got it back when he left. 

When the flight landed I realized I was almost the same height as this guy so I guess he didn’t need that legroom after all. 

Any Reddit, AITA?

Just a note: I was not being obnoxious and had my seat back all the way, probably 30% of the way. 


Edit: the default position on these seats was almost a 90 degree angle. It is unrealistic to expect I would sit through a 10 hour flight like that. ",NTA. The dude should have let you recline.

"AITA for quitting a job my sister got for me, and almost getting her fired?. This was a few years back, but my sister and I still argue about it.

I had just started College, and was in need of work to help pay for said College. My sister told me there was an opening at the local Coffee Shop she worked at, and since A. My sister already worked there, and B. I already had experience working at a different coffee shop, I was hired on the spot. They gave me hours around my College schedule, and I worked there for about a month before a new Semester started, and my school schedule changed. I should note this was a career college, so I didn't get my new schedule until about a week before the new semester.

It was ok at first, I just had to rush out of school to get to work on time. But the coming Friday I had work and school at the exact same time. I told my boss once I got my schedule that I wouldn't be able to work that day, and she would need to find someone else to cover the shift. She told me on Thursday night that I hadn't given her enough notice, and since I was still on probation I would need to work the shift, or I was basically fired. I thought about it, and I was paying $20,000 to go to college, and this was a minimum wage job at a coffee shop. There was no way I was going to skip class so I could make doughnuts and coffee. So I told her I unfortunately quit then, and I left.

She was livid. She called my sister in to her office, and said since I was her brother, and I was screwing her over that my sister would have to cover my shift, despite it being her only day off, or she was going to be let go too.

"AITA For Taking Away The Laptop I Paid For My Friend. Me and Ted are(or were) good friends since our teens. Ted's family are not too well off, so whenever we hang out usually I am the one paying for us and driving us around.


Ted had always been passionate about becoming a digital illustrator and graphic designer. He worked hard for his dream and managed to become a part time freelancer doing commissions while working in a restaurant and continue his studies in the art and design field.


About half a year ago Ted came to me asking for a favor. He wanted to buy a laptop too expensive for him and wanted me to pay for it, promising to return the sum in full in 3 months. I was hesitant, as the laptop he wanted was very expensive, almost a third more than my own laptop. However I guess as a designer in training, he needed one of the best. So being kind of a sucker, I paid for it.


As you might have guessed now, not even a single dime was paid back. I offered to have him pay me a set amount for 24 months(now thinking back, he could have done the same and bought it himself), but he kept avoiding the subject, saying he was too busy working and studying. So one day, I figured I had enough.


To cut the story short, I ""stole"" the laptop from his home during a visit. The laptop was registered under my name during payment, so I doubt he could or afford to file any charges against me. I dropped him a message before I leave that if he want it back he had to pay me the laptop's full amount. 


He begged me to return the laptop to him, as he could not do commissions or study without it. He gave many apologies and all sorts of promise that he would pay back as soon as possible, and even brought up my previous idea of installment pay. I said no, it's either the full amount or no laptop, and I will be using it as my own and delete all his data if he cannot pay me back.


I do feel sorry for him as I know the importance of a laptop to him as a designer/illustrator. But I feel like I need to grow a backbone too and stop letting him push me around. AITA?


Update: I have yet to touch anything on the laptop, but Ted had really been begging me and even meltdown in tears. Wouldn't say that's how I hoped it would turned out(But what else could I expect?

"AITA for ditching my prom date at the door?. This happened a while back but it still bugs me to this day, you guys let me know if I'm the asshole.

So my mother's cleaning lady and I were friends, when I got home from school we would chat a little bit. She told me a lot about her daughter's boyfriend who was a real POS. In and out of jail, drugs, Etc and apparently right before prom the boyfriend and the daughter broke up leaving the daughter without a prom date. Cleaning lady liked me and asked me if I would take her daughter to prom but with a caveat, the daughters good friend also needed a date for prom and would I be able to find someone to take her. Cleaning lady also tells me daughter's friend is very short, like 4 foot 9.

With this in mind I talk to my friend Luke, good kid and also on the shorter side maybe about five foot three. Really nice guy, was having trouble in the girl department at this time, and his family was filthy stinking rich. Like elevator in their house rich.

Luke says it sounds great and i set the whole thing up. 

So the day of prom arise and Luke's parents let him borrow their beautiful, brand new Lincoln Navigator to take the girls to prom in. We pick the girls up and go to a nice Chinese restaurant. That's when everything starts turning pear-shaped.

Luke's date is a complete jerk to him, like jaw-dropping comments regarding his height. All throughout dinner she is making fun of him and my date is joining in here and there. I felt so bad for poor Luke. He's a good kid and I could see him near tears with these girls picking on him. As a side note upon first arriving at the restaurant, Luke's date opens up the menu and loudly proclaimed ""What the fuck! this is all Chink food!"" My date is rolling with laughter while I've never been more embarrassed in my life.  I remember thinking to myself ""what the hell did this idiot expect from a restaurant called China Palace"".

After an hour and a half of these girls berating my friend I had had enough. They get up to go to the bathroom and I talked to Luke. I tell him that their behavior is unacceptable and I'm so sorry for dragging him into this. I suggest that we take them to the dance, pull up outside the doors, and kick them out of the car and tell them to have a good time.

The girls get back from the bathroom and we put our plan into action. Load them up in the car, drive them to their High School, and while we're in the parking lot I turn around from the passenger seat and inform them that we will not be taking them to the dance because of how they acted. These girls were hella pissed, screaming, swearing, calling us names but we didn't back down. We wish them all the best and kick them out of the car.

"AITA for ignoring my wife?. So, I love my wife. But by her own admission, she has this issue where she talks in one unbroken stream from the second she wakes up to the second she goes to sleep. She can't go see movies because she can't close her mouth. She long ago agreed it was okay for me to just walk out of the room mid-sentence, because otherwise I'd never be able to go to work or even the bathroom.

In other words, she knows it's an issue and she's cool with unusual solutions. One time she got accidentally hit in the face with a tray by a coworker and she didn't even pause her sentence. She just can't stop.

Here's the problem. While she's okay with new just hanging up on her or leaving the room to pee because she's aware there's no other solution, she still expects me to *retain* everything I *do* hear.

I obviously can't absorb that level if information non stop all day. So I just tell her yes to everything. And I stay true to my word; if I agree to something just to placate her, I always then do it when it comes up.

So, an example: apparently months ago she asked me what kind of topping she should put on a cake she was going to make and gave me choices. I just picked the second thing. So today she asked again to confirm and I guess listed the options in a different order because I picked a different one. I don't even remember the first time. She flipped out, because it seemed like I didn't care about what she was saying.

But like... of course I don't. I can't even retain 95% of it. I'd have to quit my job and take notes 24/7 to come close. I gave an opinion on the cake the first time because I know she cares and I wanted to make her happy, so I didn't say the truth, which is ""I don't even like cake so I don't care what you put on it.""

"AITA for ending a friendship with a gay guy after he kept coming onto me in creepy ways?. A bit of context: I’m a 19 year old Male and I am straight. I graduated in 2018 this guy graduated in 2019. We met in 2017 through a mutual friend via a D&D group

I found out a friend of mine wasn’t going away for college, and trying to get a group of friends together to hang with while my other friends were away I reached out to this guy. We smoked a bit and just caught up. He seemed pretty normal and chill just how I remembered him. near the end of us hanging out he told me that he was gay and was looking for gay guys to “fuck”. 

Being gay where I’m from is widely accepted so it didn’t really take me by any surprise, I told him all my gay friends are away at college so I don’t have anyone I can set him up with. 

Next time we hang out he’s acting like a totally different person. He keeps touching n shoulders, being overtly attentive to everything I’m saying, getting really close when we talk, being kind of pushy about everything, super weird. Then we stopped at a drug store to pick up his inhaler and he also bought condoms. I thought it was weird. We get back to my place and he pulls out a condom and says “I’ve gotta be honest I’m really horny”. This kind of shocked me that he was being so forward about trying to have sex with me, and it made me super uncomfortable. I turned him down, and he left soon after.

After that he just kept messaging me really weird stuff over Snapchat like asking me every day if I was busy and he tried to get me to do DMT (a crazy psychedelic drug) with him. I obviously said no. He kept messaging me basically begging me to spend time with him and to “not abandon him” basically trying to make me feel bad about ignoring him because I was really uncomfortable with the way he had been acting towards me. I ended up just un-adding him on Snapchat then blocking him on other social media. I didn’t give him any explanation I just kind of cut him off. One of my other friends told me he’s had similar experiences with the guy, both of us don’t talk to him anymore. My question is AITA for completely cutting him off without saying why, after he tried to have sex with me then kept being creepy?","NTA at all, dude.

"WIBTA for not allowing meat to be served at my wedding?. I’m a gen 1.5 Indian migrant to the UK (was born in India but moved when I was 6 with parents) so while I grew up British and consider myself to be British, I still have family in India and my Indian heritage is an important part of my identity. My wife is 4th gen Indian - her family immigrated decades ago so she, and her parents grew up fully anglicised. I’d like to stress there’s nothing wrong with that - why should she have ties to a country her grandparents were born in?

Due to the difference in culture we are having two weddings - one in England for all her family and our friends, and one in India for the rest of my family and friends there. We had the first wedding, which was very traditional and western  - church, reception etc. It was great, and we had fun. Now the wedding in India - it’s important as my grandparents are too old to fly to the UK so I’d love for them to see me get married. 

The problem comes with the menu - in a Hindu wedding, and especially in the south, you don’t serve meat. You just don’t. In fact, what’s served at a wedding is something called a [sadya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhya). It’s fully vegetarian, and served on a banana leaf - super traditional. My wife says we should allow meat, despite the cultural taboo - saying her side of the family ‘won’t be able to cope’ without meat. I’m of the opinion that they’re all adults, and they can live with the inconvenience - hell, if it’s that bad run to a KFC after the ceremony and gorge yourself - but at the wedding itself, no meat. It’s also not like there won’t be any meat - there’ll be non veg food at the Sangeet, there’ll be meat at the reception. 

Also during the English wedding I sided with her over my parents over the serving of beef - my parents, being Hindus don’t partake, but I told them they should just eat something else, not ask that beef not be served entirely. 

So, WIBTA for not wanting meat at the wedding?","NTA

"AITA for considering divorce?. Been married several years now, no kids.  We have talked about having kids, but haven't gone forward due to her anxiety about the whole process, and my fear of committing to the whole lifestyle of being a parent.

I work full time and then some, as my job keeps me busy (60, 70 hours a week). My income pays for basically everything.

She has been pursuing a career in photography for some six years.  She's made headway here and there with some good clients and jobs, but mostly she travels around and takes photos for her portfolio (meaning there is no paying client).

I have suggested focusing more time on actual marketing, or hiring an agent or joining an agency several times, to get a more steady workflow going.  Or even just having business cards for the times people ask for them.  But it seems like she doesn't want to work harder than she is now.  Sometimes I suggest that, if this career isn't growing into something productive/a means of actually supporting our economic needs, she might need try a different career path.  But she won't consider any other line of work.

I'm coming to the view that she so reliant on my income and safety net that she feels no need to make her career an actual career.  This makes me feel taken advantage of.  I've communicated as clearly as I can that this situation makes me feel take for granted, taken advantage of, etc. Even so, it seems like it doesn't affect her actual behavior when it comes to working.

I get that it's a competitive world, and photography is not easy.  I don't want to ask her to give up on her dreams or her passion.  I also can't feel okay feeling like I'm being used.

"AITA for not paying extra gas that pumped out?. I was driving out to meet a friend and and saw my gas was running low, so I walked in and paid a twenty.

"AITA for yelling at my mum. I’m a 16 year old girl for context.

Recently I went through an awful break up. The boy did things to me without my consent, cheated on me and just really screwed me up. This was about two months ago. My mum seems to have no problem reminding me that he’s moved on from me, knowing fully well that despite what he did to me I’m still in love with him. 

The relationship was incredibly rocky. His parents were nasty to my face, his sisters called me a slut and they all sent nasty messages to my mother about me. His mother sent mine a FIVE PAGE EMAIL essentially calling me manipulative, controlling and crazy when I know for a fact that I was not. His father called mine on my 16th birthday to say that he was cutting contact between me and this boy and that we couldn’t do anything about it. This went on for over a year 

Now for the AITA part: we were just enjoying dinner as a family, when my mother decided to pull up Instagram and look for my ex boyfriends new girlfriend. I asked her not to, and she said ‘it won’t hurt you for me to know’, but I knew that eventually she would tell me and it would hurt me. I told her again, no not to look for it and she continued to search. The amount of pain I’m feeling from this breakup is awful, and the trauma he left me with is crippling. I yelled at her and told her that there was no need for her to know and she was being unfair and insensitive to my feelings and stormed off. I’m now in my room and I’m wondering if this was the right thing to do or if I need to apologise. I just can’t understand why she felt the need to look for this, especially knowing the mental state I’m in right now.

"WIBTA for arriving to a concert early so I can stand in front, and refusing to give up my spot to shorter people behind me when they ask?. I love going to concerts, if it's for a band that I'm really into then I'll show up early to try and get a spot in front.  Sometimes it means arriving before the doors open and waiting in line, which can often be an hour or more from the time they let people in before the opening band starts playing. If I was there for the headliner, then it could be said that I showed up almost three hours early for a place at the front. I'm a tall guy, and if you're standing behind me then it's going to be difficult for you to see directly over me. 

Every once in a while people will ask if I can move back, but more often they'll try pushing in front of me when the show gets energetic. I'll generally say ""sorry I'm good right here"" or just hold my ground. It's never caused any big issues, but I know they wouldn't be asking or try pushing through if they had a good view of the show from where they were at. I'm sympathetic to that, but I don't think it's fair that people can just assume they can show up later than others and still expect a spot up front just because they're shorter than me. I feel that they can just move back for a better view, or show up earlier like I did if they want to stand there.

Then again, I'd give up my seat on the bus for some one pregnant or elderly or had disability or maybe even if they just had a shitty day and want to sit, and I can't articulate why this is any different to me. In both situations I'm a person who is in a position to do something courteous that won't cost me as much as some one else would gain. But I mean....I like standing in front!

"AITA for “overreacting”?. So, this has already been ‘resolved’ as I dropped my opinion, however I have been told by two people I was TA about it. 

So, this Halloween I (15 F) arranged to all meet with my friends at my BFs house, as he is also in our group. (15 M) 
I decided to introduce a friend slightly younger than us (13 F), who knew most of the group but didn’t know my BF or one of my friends. Well, the evening went great. I payed for the groups food with my spending money for an upcoming trip with my school, helped complete outfits for others and we just had an overall good hangout time... until one friend suggested going into the woods nearby (bearing in mind this is almost pitch black darkness), even though I wasn’t allowed; my parents trust me and I value that more than having a laugh with my group. Plus, I didn’t want to go, and neither did my younger friend. The rest of the group did, and my boyfriend was stuck  choosing between his friends, and me. I couldn’t stay at his whilst he left, so if he chose the friends, he’d be kicking me out of the celebrations. I felt hurt by my other friends, and so I asked him, desperately, not to go. He seemed kind of upset, mainly kind of pissy, and he said he would stay, but then I got frustrated with the others for being passive aggressive about me becoming upset, and called my mum to come pick me and younger friend up.

"AITA for not giving my dad a second chance?. A little backstory, when my mom met my biological father and had me, he was married to another woman. He kept my mother and me a secret for about 2 years, his wife eventually found out and divorced him. He turned to drugs and alcohol and began harassing and abusing my mother, eventually leading to her getting a restraining order. About a year after that, my mother met her now husband. When my step dad decided he wanted to adopt me, my bio dad agreed to give up his parental rights as long as my mom no longer pursued him for back pay in child support, and so long as he was allowed to send me gifts every now and again. I never received so much as a birthday card, and did not hear from him my entire childhood. 

I'm now 21 years old, and my biological father reached out to me. He has stage 4 cancer, found god, and would like to try and have a relationship with me. I have no desire to do this, my ""step dad"" is my father in my eyes. He raised me. He will be the one to walk me down the aisle. My biological dad is a stranger, and the only memories I have of him aren't good ones. I made it clear to him I'm just fine without him and don't want to set myself up for anymore hurt by letting him back into my life.

So my mates girlfriend has been weird since she came back from her trip overseas,  while she was there it was super stressful for him because she would be doing all this crazy shit, talking badly to him and leaving him stressed and worried 95% of the time, my mates a good guy, he understands space and trust in a relationship, her ex is a garbage heap on fire compared to him. 

Anyway a bit after she came back she starts hanging it out with her nasty gross ex,  who is the human version of a tape worm or like a plague. He's honestly the worst,  cheated on his girlfriend for my mates gf, was super emotionally and mentally abusive and had the most nastiest personality.  

My mate obviously isn't happy with it cause whenever the ex hung out his gf, they would be drinking and smoking at parties,  last time she went partying oversea, she woke up and had no memories of the night but had bruises and dicks drawn on her. He continuously asked her to not hang out with the ex,  she'd refuse over and over again,  eventually he got through to her and she said she wouldn't hang out with him anymore.

BUT I've seen the two hanging out at least once a week, till late at night, at their friends or at his house (I could see it on snapmaps). At one point when I'd asked my mate how things are he said that his gf and the ex werent hanging out at all, but she was literally hanging out with him at the time I asked.

I had this weighing on my conscience for AGES so I finally told him with the mindset that if he knew, it's fine, if he didn't then he should know.

So I told him, he said he knew, he seemed fine and dandy but then A DAY LATER they announced to our group they were ""taking a break"" and i HIGHLY believe its my fault seeing as she made an instagram post and the caption was ""supposed to be a pal but you can't mind your f****** business"" which is Hella hostile imo.

I feel like I'm the reason they broke up, they do still love eachother, if i hadnt said anything I think they would still be together, I feel eo guilty that I ruined their relationship

"AITA for having a bachelorette party on our wedding cruise?. My fiancé and I are planning a 3-day cruise where we’ll be getting married in the port of call on the second day. We’re not super close to our extended families (like, we may see them once a year, if that, and they don’t ever check in or call any other time) but we ended up having about 40 guests, mostly friends, with some family peppered in. 

I created a fb group to share the pertinent information with a brief outline of the itinerary that basically says that the first night on the cruise, we’ll have our joint bachelor/bachelorette party with our wedding party and the next day we’ll see everyone with a cocktail party following the day after. I know everyone hates being blasted with group message notifications, so I made sure to mention at the bottom to please reach out to me separately with any questions. Then my cousin replies, “What, so we don’t get to go to the party?” This took me off guard a little and I honestly thought he was kidding so I messaged him privately and told him he was more than welcomed to join in if he sees us out, but that I thought it would be awkward to celebrate this kind of event with our older family members. Then he said, “You know how awkward it is to spend thousands of dollars on a cruise and only get to see you at the beach? Just saying.” So I reminded him of the cocktail party we have planned to enjoy together and he followed up with, “I’m only going for mom and dad. Not sure how many more vacations they have. The rest of the fam is just a bonus.” 

I honestly thought it would be selfish to demand our guests spend the entire cruise they’ve paid for with us, but I also thought it would be more convenient for our wedding party (who is all over the country) to plan the party the night before the wedding since we’ll all be in the same place and they wouldn’t have to spend so much on the party itself since the cruise has already been paid for. I’ve tried so hard to consider everyone’s vacation time and budgets and I really don’t want to upset anyone because their expectations were different than mine. 

I know I’m super emotional about this wedding because of how stressful this whole thing has been and even more so because it’s also been super expensive and we’ve paid for it by ourselves, so am I the asshole for not planning on spending the entire time with all of our guests and not planning more events for them to enjoy while we’re on the cruise?","I’m torn here. The cousin is obviously overreacting, but it is a bit rude to inform everyone of a party they’re not invited to.

"AITA for essentially IRL ghosting one member of my group of friends?. There are 5 of us: 18-28M and 28F. 

The girl, Anna has a bf, Dean. Dean is emotionally abusive. We see him sometimes but he barely interacts with us despite being in the same hobby that we all bond over.

If Dean and Anna are together, they will stand away from us so they don't have to interact with us. If she's with him, she won't even talk to us a lot of the time. Anna will drop any plans she has with us at a moments notice if Dean is free. She's ditched me in the rain to walk home alone when I had decided to stay out solely to offer her some support but then she saw Dean. We went to the same event once (she went with Dean, I went alone) only for me to get a call saying he's ditched her alone in the city center, come get me. 

Now, every month or two, Anna and Dean break up and Anna is always upset and needs a lot of emotional support. We see a lot more of her and we have fun and I like *this* Anna. But she needs a lot of support and will be upset and crying and, I don't know if this is selfish, but it really puts a downer on things and spoils the fun. Bear in mind that this is a constant cycle, so the first five or so times I was happy to be there for her, to comfort her and to be a good friend. Now, it's an inconvenience that I don't want to deal with. It's emotionally draining for me to be worrying about her, if she's OK, to comfort and reassure her and to have to be around her when she's so upset when we're all just out to have fun. Especially knowing that given a week, they'll be back together anyway.

We support her, we tell her he's abusive and she knows this, and every time she says she's never getting back with him. She tells us of the awful ways he treats her, how he says horrible things about us all. Then a day later they're back together. It feels like a huge emotional drain on me to be the supportive friend when I'm needed, only to be downgraded to 'the friend I'll only see when Dean is at work'. It feels like a slap in the face that she prioritises the abusive boyfriend over her friends, that she gets back with him when he says such awful things about all of us. 

So I've had enough. It's uncomfortable when Dean is around. It's uncomfortable for me to be around her when she's gotten back with him. I hate that she wants to be with us only when he's not around. I hate that he says terrible things about us to her but she clearly values him more than us. I hate that other friends have been excluded from the group because they've also grown sick of this shit. I hate that she just expects us to be ok about all of this. It feels like she's poisoned my friend group. 

I don't want to stop being around my friends, but I want to stop being around her. There's nothing I can do as she will be there. The best I can do is simply not to engage or interact with her, which is what I've been doing.

"AITA for being pissed at my relatives for posting about my final marks at school online?. Yesterday, OPs were released. For all non-Australians out there, it’s basically your SAT scores and GPA rolled into a number between 1 and 25, 1 being the most impressive and 25 being the least impressive. I found out that I got a pretty good OP and I just took it as a quiet victory, as did my dad. My mum, however, went apeshit over it and made me call my grandpa at 7:30 in the morning and tell him what score I got. 

I was reluctant, I mean, my grandpa and I are kind of close, but I felt uncomfortable announcing my OP to people; it just felt like bragging to me. Regardless, I called him up and told him what I got and was met with a “congratulations” and that’s basically it. 30 minutes later, I see that he has tagged me in a post on Facebook, where he has announced, not just to his friends, but - due to the tag - mine as well what my OP was. 

I was very embarrassed. Other people’s parents had posted about them getting their OP on Facebook, simply said how proud they were, but didn’t go into detail about what they got. For comparison, it’s like if your parent put your SAT score on Facebook for the whole world to see; even if it was good, it would feel intrusive.

Plus, my grandpa didn’t even mention putting it on Facebook while he was on the phone with me. That’s the part I’m pissed off at the most; he didn’t even ask me before he put it up. If he asked if he could put it on Facebook, I would’ve responded with a polite ‘no’, simply because I didn’t want people to know. I know this is very ‘if everyone else jumped off a bridge, so would I’ kind of talk, but announcing your OP on social media just isn’t seen as a graceful thing to do.

I made it so the post wouldn’t appear on my timeline on Facebook and, later on, I was talking to my Mum. When I brought it up how uncomfortable I was about it, she rolled her eyes and said: ‘whatever’.

This morning, undoubtedly after seeing all the ‘you must be so proud’ comments on the post my grandpa put up about my OP, my mum put up a post saying how excellent it was. She’s always been a ‘I brag about my own child to anyone that will listen because when I brag about my child I’m basically bragging about an extension of me’ type of person, so that in itself didn’t bother me, but a couple of people asked what I got and s**t went downhill for me from there. Instead of replying with “high enough that she’s happy with it” like I saw many of the other parents were replying with, my mother came straight out with it.

This may sound childish, but I’m pissed that my relatives couldn’t be ‘normal’ about me getting my OP. I’m also pissed about how no one even asked me if they could tell the internet about my score. I confronted my mum about it and she just shook her head and said: “well, it’s very good, why wouldn’t people want to know?” 

Do I have a right to angry about this, or AITA for getting pissed off at my relatives?","NTA. Your news, your decision. People think it's okay to just post anything they want. No, this isn't the end of the world (and congrats on your good mark) but it's certainly deserving of an apology.",0,0,0,0,1

Husband decides he wants a second opinion, fine.  We take it to some guy who keeps it for a couple days then says the EXACT same thing I said.  Still not good enough.

My hubby has me drop off the pc at some chain repair shop (Which is a competitor of my business) and they tell me the same thing.

DESPITE me previously testing the PSU with my multimeter and measuring the voltages, HE believes its the PSU and refuses to listen to me that the PSU is fine and that its not the issue.  So I offer to test it in front of him to show him its fine.  I tell him I need the PSU and cables out of the case, he only pulls out the PSU and tells me I should just be able to test that.  I tell him no, I need the cable and he just snaps and tells me to spit it out what I need.

So, i am an atheist but my mother is a buddhist and recently my father passed away, even though he was also an atheist my mother decided to do a buddhist funeral to sent him off,now i dont believe in any kind of spirit or gods or ghosts, so i just didnt want to participate in any of these prayers, but i just kept getting forced, but all i wanted to do was to be alone and have some quiet time but my releatives kept telling me i had to pray, during the third day when we were supposed to send his spirit away, i just kept quiet and stayed in my room but my religious aunts and uncles kept on knocking on my doors saying ""its time to send your dads spirit away, STOP BEING SO DISRESPECTFUL"" , i just wanted to grief in my own way but i had to keep getting forced to do it their way,so people of the internet, AITA for not doing what my religious family kept telling me to do?

","Edit : NTA (previously Y-T-A (tiny bit)) 

I've been an atheist for as long as I can remember and I participate fully in all rituals with my Hindu/Buddhist family as long as it isn't too toxic. I've also gone to church and mosque and when asked to pray do some silent self-meditation.

This is not just your family's religion, it's their *culture* and it's your culture as well. Your lack of belief doesn't need to include rejecting your family's rituals if they aren't causing harm. Funeral rites are a way for loved ones to gather and celebrate the person who has passed away. It brings people together. I would suggest you participate but instead of thinking of everything as meaningless, give each ritual your *own* meaning in private. Let each incense stick you light represent a good memory with your father, for instance.

Death is hard and complicated to deal with. Don't push away your loved ones unnecessarily, they are there to support you.

Edit: Having read your updates, clearly you are doing nothing wrong! You've done as much as you can and your relatives are pushing you to do something that would be distasteful to any person, let alone someone who is grieving! I'm glad your mom is backing you up here.

"AITA for calling out my ""friends"" for having get together memorializing a friend who was murdered. Okay so the title probably makes me sound like a huge asshole. However my best friend was murdered 2 years ago on January 10th by another mutual friend, whom he lived with, over drugs and money. His body was not discovered for two days, January 12th. For the past two years my ""friends"" have decided to ""honor"" him  by throwing a huge party on January 12th. I  do not have a problem with this whatsoever, I think it's a good thing to have a get together and see everyone and remember our friend. The issue I do have is that this event always involves people doing lots of drugs and getting belligerently drunk. Which of course also leads to drama and fights at this event. I have said in the past multiple times that I think we should have a more formal event and make it more about our friend than the party. This year, I was not invited to the event, despite the fact that I was this person's best friend and that we spent nearly every day together for 4 years, we lived close to each other in the same small town. I was upset about this because there were tons of people invited who didn't even know or were friends with, our friend who passed. I have had no ill words with anyone in my friend group ever, I have been nothing but supportive of them and have always been there for them. I was very hurt by not being invited. I probably wouldn't have went anyway because I disagree with how they ""honor"" him, but in my eyes I feel like I was the only person excluded form the event. Even people they knew couldn't go or didn't want to go was invited, except for me. I was really upset with them and confronted them about it. I expressed that I felt that by memorializing him by using drugs and alcohol was not appropriate, considering he was killed over drugs, and using them in his name to honor him was disrespectful. I expressed that his parents would not want that, which I know them on a much more personal level than anyone at the party, since I spent a lot of time with them. I also expressed that if our friend knew his fate he would not want everyone to be using drugs. I also expressed that if they want to honor him then they need to make something of themselves, rather than indulge themselves on drugs and alcohol, and learn from our friend who passed mistakes because he doesn't have the choice to do that anymore. If he could speak now that's what he would want for us. After I told them this I was repetitively told I was ""fucking retarded"" I was a ""dumbass"" I was a total "" judgement piece of shit"" and that I better ""watch my shit. After this I told them that I never wanted to be included or be a part of anything that involved them ever again. So this leads to my final question. Am I the Asshole? Because I have sure been made to feel that way.

Update: after much thinking I talked too my friend who coordinated the event. I apologized for my actions and how I mishandled the situation and he did the same. So now everything between us has been cleared up and has been put behind us. ","NTA.

"AITA for refusing to do what my bf wants for his birthday gift?. This is very petty but causing a debate lol.

For his birthday I bought him some stuff alongside tickets to see his favourite team play which cost a decent amount of money. To get these tickets I also had to buy a membership for the club both for myself and him.

In my opinion, the fact that I am willing to even go to this game and support him if they score despite them being my team’s rivals for his happiness is enough.

Here is the issue, my team’s colour is light blue and his is red. Whilst I will not wear their actual t-shirt, I will be wearing a random hoodie that I wear on a weekly basis anyway that happens to be dark blue.

"AITA for blaming my SO when I kicked my laptop off the end of the bed. My SO is borrowing a laptop from me, but it's my second laptop and it's a bit slow so she prefers to use mine.

So, while I was just getting settled for a mid-afternoon nap (been working a lot lately...), she put the second laptop at the end of the bed, to the right of my feet, and got in on my left and started using my primary one. Which is fine, obviously I wasn't using it.

I couldn't get to sleep, since it's the middle of the day I don't know what else I expected, so I turned over and stretched my legs out and heard the loud thunk sound of macbook hitting (edit: laminated) floor. The cold metal on the sole of my foot in the process alerted me immediately to what had happened, and I looked at her somewhat exasperated and said (admittedly, probably with my voice raised, though it wasn't intentional, but I was in a state of shock/disbelief/panic) ""why on *Earth* did you leave it there?""

Her response was that it was clearly my fault for kicking it off, how was she supposed to know I would 'fling my legs out' (her words), she was just leaving it there to charge, I'm childish for being unable to take responsibility for my mistakes.

This made me angry, so I snatched my primary laptop back off of her, we had an argument about whose fault it was (no name calling or anything, nothing mean, just me giving my POV and her repeating what I wrote above with our voices raised). She stormed out. 

So, I'll be honest, I don't think I am TA but maybe I'll get some perspective here. AITA?

Edit: I wrote ""second laptop"" all the way through, but it actually belongs to one of my friends. He kindly lent us his second laptop while hers is currently unavailable. Maybe that explains better why I was pretty panicked.

"AITA: accidentally sat in disabled seating. Hi there. So I was getting the bus from the airport to my friend’s town a few days ago. I have bad eyesight so I assumed the disabled seats were the ones that were foldable at the direct front of the bus and sat down on the closest seats to the front as they were the easiest for me to see the sign displaying the stop approaching (the bus doesn’t have an automated voice to announce it). 

The seats I sat in were disabled but they weren’t clearly marked. The only marking of them was a small circular sign on the walls of the bus under the window. At about the level of your knee when you would be seated. Every other seat behind me seemed to have similar circular signs beside them but these other ones, I learned after, were for advertising the plugs for chargers underneath the seats. As the seats directly in the bus are turned facing the windows, while the one I sat in was facing the front, I assumed I was fine. 

Anyway, I was reading and got very lost in my book. There was a stop halfway through my journey and I heard someone speaking but I assumed they were speaking to someone they were with while getting onto the bus.

Then I got jabbed in the leg with a crutch and then I heard someone say “I said, oh aye I’ll go on down the bus and sit somewhere further along will I?”
I was really confused by the sarcasm as I have problems in social situations (aspergers). But when I saw the man had crutches and was quite intimidating looking (he was considerably taller than me, I’m a five foot three woman) I immediately got up and started to move to the seat across the aisle from me. 

As I was getting across, the man shoved me further into the aisle to get into the seat and said “these seats are for disabled people you know”. I didn’t say anything in response as, like I said, I have a hard time processing social situations. I felt pretty bad about it so I needed your opinions.

So. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole?","NTA because it was a misunderstanding on your part. The guy on crutches was unnecessarily rude and aggressive.

"WIBTA if I told a good looking girl to practice good hygiene?. Alright, this is kind of tough. So this girl I’ve been talking to really likes the IT movies even has cosplayed as pennywise and did a damn good job of it for Halloween last year. The thing is, she’s pretty attractive, but she doesn’t follow the basic necessity of humanity called hygiene. Im kind of torn and maddened over this. I’m told that she just gives herself a splash of water wash and calls it a day so that it doesn’t ruin her hair or something far fetched among those lines. Not to mention when we did hang out once she actually did smell super bad like dog vomit and I kind of died there. Her friend tells me that she has a crush on me and I’m like well yeah Shes cute except she smells so bad! It makes me mad that she doesn’t actually properly wash herself, like how does one who is actually good looking leave out hygiene???

The new IT movie came out and I tell her about it because she’s an IT fan girl and then she immediately wanted to make plans with me and her friend to go see the movie and hang out afterwards. Her friend calls me and we have a bit of a chat about it, says this is unusual because her(it fan girl) and guys are a strange or unusual thing because well nobody likes someone who smells bad it’s a huge deal breaker.  This invitation turned out to be a surprise.

Suddenly I get this hunch-if this girl likes me maybe I do slap her with the truth and be straight up gift her some good smelling hair and body wash and that would make her actually normal. I don’t know if she’d react well to that and be in denial though or for once agree.

"WIBTA for declining a catch-up drink with an old housemate who reached out to me?. As the title says, although I thought it definitely could do with some more context.

&#x200B;

When I moved out of my mum's house (M 25 UK) I moved into a flat with a colleague I worked with at the time (F 24 UK).  We moved in as friends, and all was well until she moved out suddenly, and left me with a mess of bills to clear up, and a huge amount of work to do to return the room and bathroom she had, to a useable space again.

&#x200B;

The house was left in a pigsty (bogies wiped on the back of the sofa) and the whole experience felt like a very nasty breakup (as I'm sure these situations can be)  and we haven't spoken since.  This was April 2016 she moved out, and messaged me yesterday.

&#x200B;

I was cast as the 'bad guy' after she moved out, and it took 6+ months of work to rebuild the relationship I'd had previously with our mutual friends - we all worked together so there was a lot of friends that we shared between us.

"AITA for leaving my work in shambles. AITA. Background: I work in a technical field that I believe is underpaid. I realized, recently, that I don't want to do this for 10+ years. My plan was to go back to school as I dropped out close to completing my BS. My lease on my apartment, that I share with 3 others, is up in about 20 days. They are all going off and either moving back in with their parents or moving too far for me to commute. (this particularly sucks because I moved 60 miles here to help all of us get an apartment). So I have had to try and find a 1 bed apartment that I can afford, which is hard. Not only can I not afford much but if I want to go to school, I am going to have to move in 6mos to go to the school I want to and can't start a 12mos lease. My sister and I are both going to the same college and getting an apartment together which is why the deadline and the move. I also haven't been able to actually look at any listings of apartments because my car is in the shop. So the plan I made with my family is to move back and live with them for 6mos until my sister and I go to school. Try to transfer back down where I used to work (same field and company just different location), which is still in the works. And save as much money as possible before going to school. 

The issue is that my current coworker, whom we will call Joe, and I are already backed up for appointments until March and he is relatively new and now I have to reschedule every appointment that was mine for him or other locations nearby that are pretty much just as busy. Clients are pissed and I can tell my boss, Bill we shall call him, is also not happy but seemingly understanding. Everyone knows that this means that things are about to become much worse for Joe and Bill having to deal with clients being 3-4 months out for appointments because of how short staffed the area is. The stress of being the lead tech at my location for a pay that I believe is inadequate for what we do and deal with, ultimately lead me to wanting something more. And I refuse to apologize for looking out for myself. So I gave my current place a 2 week notice that even if I don't get the transfer that I will be leaving and am currently the one trying to get every client that is already scheduled, rescheduled which has lead to many unhappy clients. Bill is getting more and more upset at me because of the situation that ""I"" have put everyone in and it grows with every customer absolutely not okay with being rescheduled. I put ""I"" in quotes because ultimately the little pay and little support from management has pushed me to figure out something else and in order to do that I have to leave.

"AITA for filing a complaint against a manager who refused to accept my ID as valid. Backstory: On  mother's day I went to a local grocery story that I've been going to  for ages to buy my mom some flowers and get some beer. I'm coming on 23  and have been going to this story on and off for beer for damn near 2  years now, never ever had a problem. I get along well with the  employees, especially with a woman in the liquor department (this is relevant to the story). This particular day, I'd driven up there without realizing that I hadn't brought my wallet because I had cash in my pocket to pay with- no big deal, I carry an old copy of a license which has an older address on it  (but still technically valid through the date) in my car with me for this exact reason. In any case, I get through checkout and eventually have to call the manager because the employee won't validate my age. He basically tells me that I don't look like the person on the ID.

Then, I see the lady from liquor department who always checks me out. I asked her to help me assure the manager the ID is legit. He tells me he won't sell me the liquor because he insists it isn't my ID (address is different, which is why I got a new one), and then proceeds to try to keep my ID. I put my foot down here because, frankly, this is ridiculous. My hair was longer then, but I have the same piercings and everything as in that photo.

In a sense that, we all dread following up with his cases because it's so full of mistakes & messy even after review from our supervisor. 

So about 1 1/2 years later, I'm having lunch with a buddy from a different department and the conversation is as follows:

Buddy: Hey, so do you guys have anything planned for John's departure tomorrow?

Me: ...what? Depart where?

Buddy: ?? John's last day at work is tomorrow, you're not planning anything?

It turns out, he handed in his resignation a whole month before and is leaving the next day after this conversation. 

I asked my other senior colleagues after lunch as to why wasn't I told about him leaving, as I'm the next junior in line to inherit his work. They all said that he mentioned he was going to tell me himself & that they found out just a few days earlier than me. 

I confronted him, may have called him a POS, because his tasks at work are kind of substantial, and I was hurt. Our department went through hell together, so I thought of us as comrades. He casually apologized but still kind of pushed his hand over to me to the next day(his last day at work)

Come the morning of the next day, he still isn't handing anything over to me, no briefing, no instructions etc. I asked him again, and he just said 'Later'. I got really annoyed at this point & went straight to my supervisor to tell her what happened. She was angry, he had a whole month to hand over but decided to leave it on his last day, plus I had to hear it from another department. She then summoned him up and I assumed berated him as he came back to our dept. with his face all sullen & irritated. 

2 Hours before he left, he just handed me a piece of paper crudely detailing what I was supposed to follow up on. 

A senior colleague from another department heard about this & told me I didn't have to make such a big deal and tell my supervisor about, saying, 'Well, he did hand over in the end did he not?' 

So, AITA for complaining about him ?",NTA. He definitely is for not giving you the work earlier,0,0,0,0,1
"WIBTA if I told my friends I’m dating my partner?. I have been dating my SO for a little under a 2 months now. We agreed to keep it to ourselves for a bit at first, and that was fine. Now that’s it’s been a couple months, my friends have obviously noticed we spend a lot of time together. He has been around me and my friends before, and it’s clear that something is going on. Now, at this point, I don’t mind telling my friends. I would kind of prefer it. He came out to an engagement party with me and my friends and they joked about him seeing other people. I have to specify here, I really don’t believe there’s anything suspicious going on. But the fact that they assume he’s still seeing other people just rubbed me the wrong way. In his eyes, it would be funny if my friends thought we were only hooking up for as long as possible. He gives me no reason to believe he's cheating. He just finds it entertaining for some reason. My friends know that I have broken off things with my previous hook ups and keep asking me about our relationship status. It’s getting kinda uncomfortable to keep lying to my friends and make it seem like we’re not something when we are. I brought this up, but he insisted that we try to keep it up for as long as possible. I asked what I was supposed to do when they try to hook me up with some of their friends when we go out (which happens often), and he said at that point I should tell them.

On one hand, I don’t want to break any trust we have built up so early on, but on the same hand I’m not a big fan of lying to my friends especially when we’re so open with each other about our relationships. I also am not a big fan of the light this puts me in. In their eyes I have given up all my other hook ups and am tying myself to a person who is still seeing other people.

Just to clarify a few things, I have heard him on the phone with his step mom talking about me. He’s made it clear to her that we were in a relationship. So he’s not hiding the fact that we’re dating from his friends/family, just mine.

So, WIBTA for just telling my friends we’re dating? He really wants to keep this illusion going and doesn’t want me to ruin it. But I don’t want to be at a point where I’m stuck either flirting with someone at a bar or just admitting I’m in a relationship. Am I just being sensitive? It’s really harmless and otherwise, our relationship is perfectly fine. Of course I’ll bring it up again, but at this point if someone asks I’d rather just spill the beans.","NTA

"AITA for wanting to keep my neighbor's cat?. To start, throwaway account for reasons.

&#x200B;

Kind of a long story because I want all the details out there so I can know if I am wrong to think this way.

&#x200B;

I live in an apartment complex with my roommate and a month ago (first week of December) I got off work at night and found a stray cat pressed up against our door. I brought it inside and it eventually warmed up to us after a few days. During this time, we were doing everything we could to find the owners. I was looking on pages on FaceBook for stray cats, we called multiple shelters asking about missing cats, and even went to our landlord to see if they had any missing cat reports. The landlord said there was one cat reported missing and gave us the number to call. We called the number and a lady and her husband came over and said the cat we found was not theirs. We then took the cat to the vet to get it checked for a chip and sure enough it was chipped. We were given information to contact the chip company and did so. They found two numbers attached to the chip and said they would get back into contact with us when they received word from the owner. We received a call back later that night and the chip company told us they tried both numbers and got no response. The first number they tried twice and both times it just kept ringing without going to a voicemail. The second number did go to a voicemail and they left a message and told us when the owners called back we would hear from the chip company. We waited at least a week (still trying to find anything about this missing cat) and never got a call back from the chip company (we gave them both of our phone numbers so it is not like they tried calling and it got missed). At this point we didn't want to keep the cat just yet so we called the humane league near us, explained the situation, and asked what we should do. We were told that at this point if no contact has been made the owners don't care about the cat and are not actively looking for it; it was ours to keep. We decided to keep it because we have been wanting to get a cat recently. We took care of and loved this animal for a month now, playing with it all day, taking it to the vet, paying the expenses to get shots for it, medicine to clean its ears out (it had earmites when we found it), and other household essentials for a cat. Today, though, I was leaving my apartment to go to work and when I opened my door my next door neighbor was going to their apartment. They saw the cat in my apartment as the door was closing and asked if I had found their cat (they called it by the original name that only the old owners would know). They showed me a FaceBook post of the cat they made about a month ago saying that it was missing. Obviously at this point I had no choice but to give the cat back because it was clearly theirs. I did so and now I just do not feel right having done so. For details, these neighbors have been nothing but loud and annoying since we moved in about 2 years ago. They are up at all hours of the night (we have heard them stomping around at the hours of 2-4 AM), they have 1 or 2 children that cry pretty much all the time (this mostly results with the parents screaming at the kids to shut up and doing nothing else to stop it. As I was writing this post I heard a child bawling its eyes out only to hear the mom start imitating its cry back to it and the dad screaming ""shut up!!""), about once a week (or more) the adults engage in screaming fights at each other, and they play really loud EDM music at random times (like REALLY loud). I understand that children are going to cry but the way I hear them handle those situations just does not seem good. My roommate told me that he talked to the neighbor while I was at work and asked about how the cat got out and why they didn't contact anybody outside of making a FaceBook post. They told them that the cat probably got out from doors being opened and closed. They live in the upstairs apartment which has a stairwell that has two doors the cat would have had to have gone through to get out. I have always noticed that their front door is often cracked and never fully shut which explains how the cat got out. He also explained the earmites situation to them and was told they got it taken care of but did nothing when the earmites came back. This kind of reckless behavior is what makes me think they don't deserve the cat.

&#x200B;

To me it does not seem like this is a good home for this loving, sweet cat and I am heartbroken to have had to give it back. My instinct tells me that I am the asshole in this situation because I could not imagine losing a pet and having someone else keep it. However, I feel that my roommate and I were taking (and would take) better care of that animal. I just cannot understand why someone who is missing a cat would only make a FaceBook post about it and then do nothing else. They didn't knock on any neighbor's doors, they didn't put up any flyers, they didn't go to any shelters to report it, and they didn't even go to the landlord about the cat. My roommate and I have been loving this cat to no end for the past month and I just don't feel right having given it back to people who don't even seem to care about it. Please set me straight if I am being an asshole here.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone. My roommate and I talked over the situation last night and as much as it sucks we know that we did the right thing giving the cat back to its rightful owners. We are planning to adopt a new cat of our own soon. We are hoping to get reimbursed for the expenses we paid to take care of this cat (we got our neighbor's phone number to contact them) but were told they probably won't have the money until tax season.",NTA.

"AITA for wanting my brother's girlfriend to watch her kid more?. Ok Reddit, for this you'll need some backstory. I'm a 16yo girl who's lived alone with my mom and cat for the last 4ish years after my mom kicked my brother out. About a year and a half ago, my brother(21) announced that he got his girlfriend(35), pregnant and that he was bringing her, their kid, and her older kid down to live with us around Christmas time. Long story short it ended up being 3 kids, instead of 2 but we just kinda shrugged it off. 

Now, the girlfriend is extremely immature. She loves gossip, ""drama"" and is extremely lazy, think of her as a high school freshman essentially. One of her kids is a girl a month younger than me and, while she stayed with us, she was watching the baby more than everyone in the house. She fed him, changed his diaper, carried him everywhere, bathed him, etc. She was basically his mom. Now the reason she could do this all day despite being a child, was that she was homeschooled, but because she spent so much time watching him, she never did any work. Eventually her grandma, girlfriends mom, came down to visit. She was the one who kinda spilled the beans on everything, saying she was glad her daughter came down here because she didn't want to raise another one of her grandchildren (she p much raised the older kid.) The older kid eventually left with her grandma, her reason being that she ""didn't want to be a babysitter anymore.""

Now here we are in present day. The job of babysitting was transferred to MY grandma, until my mom called them out of it, and then to her 13yo kid. Now like I've said before, I've lived alone for the past couple of years, I'm an introvert at heart and prefer to stay away from people. If anyone's been super affected by these guys moving in, it's my 14yo cat, Shelly. Once the baby started  walking, his favorite place to be was the laundry room, in here he would turn the laundry on and off and eventually start eating cat food (this later turned into dropping cat food into her water dish.) His mom never stopped him from doing this, she'd just say, ""Ky, stop."" And leave it at that. Their move in general caused my cat a lot of stress, but this threw her way over the edge, she started defecating and urinating outside of the litter box, became a lot more vocal and would only go eat at night. Now, I didn't mind cleaning up after her, my problem was that my mom was threatening to get rid of her because of this. I've had this cat since I was 3, there was no way in hell I'd give her up cause some milf can't watch her kid.

A few nights ago, my mom and I asked her if she could try to keep him out of the laundry room (keep in mind that his actions alone raised my mom's water bills to $400+.) She became super defensive, saying that she can't watch him 24/7 cause then she ""wouldn't be able to do anything but watch him."" She then got mad at me for ""blaming him for being a baby"" when in reality I was blaming her for not watching him. This really pissed me off because, even though my cat's actions aren't my fault, she still complains to me about her going on the counters (searching for clean water in the sink) and crapping on the carpet. I still take responsibility for my cat, but she refuses to take responsibility for her son.

TLDR; My brother's girlfriend doesn't take responsibility for her son's actions and considers me an asshole for wanting her to watch him more.

","NTA, obviously.

Why the hell did your mom let them move in in the first place?

You can look into getting a chain lock for the laundry room - it would keep it just open enough for the cat to get in and out but make it so the baby can't get in. Also, where is your brother in all this? The baby is just as much his responsibility as his girlfriend's. This whole situation is fucked.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for not letting my BF rejoin family after he packed up and left?. Hi all, 
AITA: Last year at Thanksgiving week (Tuesday before) my BF (5 months in) was resting in the guest room at my sisters, while I was in living room chatting with sister - first time meeting my family BTW. 

From about 7pm on I'm thinking that he's sleeping as I hear nothing from upstairs.  I'm in the living room talking to my sister - I live West Coast & this is East Coast so we don't get to see each other much.  My phone is right next to me & he has not texted or reached out, so I think he's asleep.  

At about 11pm he comes downstairs, bags packed and announces ""This was a mistake"", ""I never should have come here"" & that he's going back home. Despite us asking him multiple times to stay, he leaves.  My sister and i are stunned for a moment because we were completely caught off guard. Once we get our bearings we jump in the car to go find him.  We find him, and drive alongside him for a few blocks trying to come back. He refuses over and over, so eventually we just let him go. he's never been to this city before so we are concerned that he's walking around at night somewhere he's never been. Eventually texts me to let me know that he's checked into a hotel for the night as we asked him to just let us know that he's safe. 


However, when we speak the next day, he mentions that part of what happened is that I was ignoring him, in addition to him having hard time with his recent divorce/custody issues.  Since then he's stormed out of arguments and not spoken to me for a few days, but he's never done anything like that related to the kids, so I'm not sure if the kid thing is really true, but that's what he said. 

Anyway, the next day he called me, we spoke on the phone -  he wanted to rejoin the family. However, I was of the opinion that if he had decided he needed to go, he should probably go with that.  My response was NOT letting him come back for a couple reasons: a) I was really hurt that he took off like that & tried to say that I was ignoring him & that's why he left b) I kind of feel like once you say you are going back home, you should probably just go  c) We had only been dating for 5 months so wasn't really sure what to think of his behavior d)  This was my first time seeing my family for Thanksgiving in over a decade & I didn't want any other outbursts/incidents. I didn't want this 'family' trip to turn into a circus focused on him.  He ended up renting a car to visit a friend a few states away rather than fly back home.  

should i have let him come back?   He is blaming me for Thanksgiving without acknowledging that he set the wheels in motion for whatever was to come. I was trying to show that I have boundaries/can't be treated like that & once you announce ""i'm leaving!"", you've left ME and the expectation that you can just come back is a little unrealistic. We've recently broken out up but I want to get input as to whether IATA and should have let him come back or whether I had appropriate boundaries given the situation.","NTA

I get home from school, and set my laptop on my bed, and after I notice a sugary substance all over my bed. It’s everywhere. I think it’s my dog that got on my bed or something, so I shake the sugary substance off my laptop, and get the sheet washed. No major issue.

I talked to my mom about it later, and she says, “Yeah, I sprinkled salt on your bed to draw out negative energy.” What? Okay, that sounds pretty stupid, but whatever, I ask her not to do it again, and she agrees.

About a day or two later, I notice my laptops fans aren’t working right, and there is a super annoying buzzing coming from it whenever I use it. So I take it to Apple and have them clean it out, and they say, “There was a little dust but some weird grainy substance in there, (salt) should be okay now.”

I get home, and I can still hear the buzzing. I can’t even use it because it’s driving me crazy.

I’m 90% sure that this is all caused by the salt she laced my bed with. I’m super careful with my expensive stuff, so I normally would never let any of this happen.

"AITA for making my significant other feel judged over a disagreement we had about cultured meat?. My SO and I got into a big discussion about cultured meat the other day, having transitioned to the discussion when discussing how we’d handle any future kids nutrition. She’d mentioned how there is an absurd amount of water used in the way we do meat at the moment, and I went on to cite some statistics that supported what she was saying. I then went from there and said that we’d probably have a lot more water on the planet once we switched to cultured meat, but that we’d have to wait until people get over the stigma about things that grow in a laboratory.

She said she was a person with such a stigma, and that she refused to ever try cultured meat once it’s more available and affordable for lower middle class people like ourselves. Her hangup was that she doesn’t believe it’s possible to produce such meat without using “unnatural chemicals”, and I asked her if it’d make more sense for us to educate ourselves further on how cultured meat is grown before making statements about what is and isn’t possible. She said she wouldn’t read any more into it, but that I was free to.

My parents are immigrants, and can barely speak the language here regardless of being in the country for 30+ years.

I was severely abused as a child (beaten to the point of hospitalization on a couple occasions). I took these beatings often times for myself and to protect my little sisters (all of us are girls). My dad is an alcoholic and my mom has joined him in drinking over the years. He's had multiple DUI's caused a lot of family issues, financial issues for us, my mom never was willing to leave him, I stuck around to protect my sister because my mom was always working. We are all adults in our mid-late 20's now, great jobs and making a decent amount of money enough to support our own lives.

I got a call while I was at work this morning, my dad was wasted, stole my moms car, drove himself to his probation officers office and was not able to understand what she was trying to explain to him. This is not a new thing for me as he has a serious language barrier, I pick up the call and the probation officer told me that he had denied the fact that he drank or that he drove himself there(he hasn't had a license in 10 years due to multiple DUI's) . I asked her to put the phone on speaker, and explained to him what she was trying to tell him about his therapy requirements and I hung up immediately after. He's been calling me to help him, I've been ignoring it, my mom's been calling me, which I'm sure is to leave work and go help him, but I really don't want to, I've wasted enough of my time on this BS. I'm happy, siblings are safe and happy, I'm not willing to deal with this.

The issue is that my mom is doing well, going to work properly and getting her mental health in check, if I choose not to help, my mom will fall back into drinking with him, stop going to work to drive him around to these appointments, and I'll end up with 2 alcoholic parents again.

"AITA For being upset at my girlfriend due to her financial decisions?. My gf (20F) and I (20M) have been together for almost 2 years. In that time I have spent thousands on plane tickets to see her since we did not live in the same state for an entire year. I have paid for her tickets to me, and my tickets to her. Which I am perfectly okay with because I love her and want to be around her.

I have also paid for her mistakes. She ruined a $400 couch once after a drunk night out, I covered that cost since I had the money and she didn’t, this was during the year we were apart and I was working a steady job and she was in university, with no job. I never asked for the money back.

During our visits throughout that year I also financially provided for almost all of her meals while I was in town because she couldn’t afford to eat out. I was fine with all of this.

This year we are at the same university, and see each other on a regular basis. She received a full scholarship and grant this year, so she is extremely financially stable, she actually gets paid to go to university. She has spent thousands on a new macbook, a huge tv, a surround sound system, etc. All things she wanted for herself. She had a laptop, tv and speakers, these new purchases were “upgrades.”

Last week we went out to grab burgers and I was short $3, so she paid for me and immediately ask for her money when we got home. I also broke my leg recently, and spent some time at her place overnight, in that time I finished a container of her ibuprofen, and she expected me to replace the $2 container.

I never spent money on her expecting to be given anything but appreciation in return. Now the roles are flipped. I cannot work because of my broken leg, and she has plenty of extra money because of her scholarship. I dont expect her to shower me with gifts, but it would be nice for her to maybe cover my $3 dollar burger, or instead of spending thousands on luxuries for herself, help me when I’m hurting, like I helped her when she couldn’t fly to me.

"WIBTA if I didn’t tell my friend about something embarrassing?.

So basically, I sort of have this issue with wetting the bed, and it’s really embarrassing because I’m way too old for that stuff (I’m 21). It doesn’t happen every night, but it’s often enough to be kind of an issue. I definitely do it much more when I’m anxious, and since I’m on summer break from school, I haven’t been doing it very much as of late (it’s happened like 3 times this whole summer, compared to once or twice a week during the school year).

Anyways, a couple of weeks ago my boyfriend and I went on a camping trip and stayed at a really rural, isolated campsite that I’d never been to before. Unlike my bf, I didn’t have a sleeping mat to make the ground under the tent a little softer, so I asked my friend/housemate if I could borrow her yoga mat. She said that was fine, so for the first few nights of camping I used it without any issues. Then, on the last night we were there, my bf and I were lying in the tent about to fall asleep when I heard a girl crying at the next campsite over and I sort of freaked out a little bit that someone was hurting her. After that, every little noise I heard kind of sounded like someone entering our campsite and coming for me (this sounds crazy lol bear with me). My bf and I eventually rationalized the situation and I ended up falling asleep a few minutes later. By because I was so anxious before I fell asleep, I woke up in the middle of the night to find that I’d wet the bed. I woke my bf up to tell him to be careful not to roll onto my side (we’ve been together for two years and slept together for many nights so he knows the deal with my problem) and then I changed my clothes, put a towel down and went to sleep. When I woke up, I saw that I had completely soaked through both her yoga mat (it covered about half of the surface area) and the tent. When my bf and I got  to his apartment I grabbed some cleaning supplies and sanitized the entire yoga mat and the entire floor of the tent, and then he dropped me, my belongings, and my friend’s yoga mat back at my apartment. 

My friend was visiting her hometown when I got back and she’s still there, so I haven’t seen her since she lent me the yoga mat. WIBTA if I didn’t tell her that I accidentally wet the bed on it? I really don’t want to tell her because she doesn’t know about my problem and it would be a really embarrassing thing to get into. Only my bf, another friend who found out, and myself know about it, and I really want to keep it that way. We’re close, but it would still just be such an embarrassing thing to tell her about, so WIBTA if I just gave her back the mat and didn’t say anything about it?

Edit: I just feel like I should tell her because I know that what I did to it was really gross, and I’d completely understand if she wants to throw it away and have me buy her a new one. But if I keep this a secret from her, she wouldn’t even have the option to make that choice, which feels wrong.","NTA, but like maybe Google the brand of Mat and buy a new one for her.

"WIBTA If I ditched my HS graduation family dinner?. So my High School graduation is tomorrow, there's a Grad night after party which intertwines with my family dinner and I'm very conflicted.

I genuinely wanted to go, however my mom has a dinner planned for me at the same time as the Grad Night after party, this is the problem.

I've been trying to convince my mom to have the dinner earlier, at 5:00 PM instead of 11:00 PM ( So I can go to my Dinner AND the Grad night after party). The graduation ceremony starts at 8:00 PM and presumably ends at 10:00 ( The drive home is about 45 minutes so the family dinner wouldn't start till 11:00 PM).

She however has been extremely stubborn and won't even consider rescheduling it, I told her to give me a reason, a single one and I'd leave her alone, as it benefits literally no one to have the dinner so late.

"AITA for choosing my friends over her?. I'll try to keep this as concise as possibly and hopefully it doesn't come off like I'm just rambling, and I'll preface this by saying this is a long distance relationship.

&#x200B;

tl;dr at bottom of post

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had met this girl through my friends, and unfortunately for us to get together I ended up treading some of these friends toes, which led to them rightly not looking at me in the best light anymore. (this has since been mostly patched up after a lot of apologising). Her friends had assimilated into our group so it was one giant group by this time.

&#x200B;

About a month into our relationship we had our first petty fight/'breakup' over some miscommunication on both our parts, and typing this out it seems so immature but basically because she thought I had placed a friend of hers into her old 'GF discord position of a server I ran (nothing special, other than in name only),' which I didn't. I went to my friends to let off steam about this fight, and then when she got up a height about the possibility of me doing that I tried cover my tracks and say I didn't tell them (which is definitely an asshole thing to do). She found out and believes that her friends believed me over her in terms of our version of events on how the first breakup happened and because one of her friends seems like they have a malicious side, they were harassing her. I told her to ditch that 'friend' and not to let them get to her, but because that person hangs out with the rest of the group, the whole thing has been tarred and is now considered toxic to her.

&#x200B;

We got back together but she said she found it hard trusting me, and became increasingly paranoid and even more jealous than she was before (we played MMOs together, and interaction where there could have been a girl and she would be on edge), and she would get increasingly angry at the smallest things in my eyes (she would get angry at me not letting her know how long I was going to be on a different game for before we played something together (this usually means I'll have an hour of *me time* before doing something with her) or if I didn't reply to her straight away she would go into a sulk to the point where it would feel like I would have to grovel to make her forgive me.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now and she gave me an ultimatum to either ditch my 'toxic' friends or she's going to leave (even though we have talked so much about 'futures' together and things like that). **Am I the asshole for choosing my friends?** 

&#x200B;

(I wouldn't say they're toxic at all, they can be a little asshole-ish at points but who hasn't been when the majority of the time they're good people? I've known them for more than 9 years compared to her relatively short time of knowing them)  

&#x200B;

(Basically a lot of our 'breakups' seem to be around her getting incredibly jealous over totally innocuous things or getting really angry about things, and expecting me to bring her down from her anger and if I don't I'm told I don't care about her because I get tired of always having to diffuse her when she does get angry).

&#x200B;

tl;dr I had been in a long distance relationship for about 6 months that was quite rocky (fighting over stupid things, immaturity from both parties), she gave me an ultimatum to get rid of what friends i had or she was going to leave and forget about our 'future'.",If she forces you to make that choice then choosing your friends is the right move.

"WIBTA for breaking up with my girlfriend because she doesn’t have sex with me?. Backstory, been dating my girlfriend for a few months now. Its mostly problem free, she’s a great person, very pretty, and has a bright future ahead of her. However, the major elephant in the room? We have not had sex at all.

I’m not a virgin and neither is she. The main difference is I’ve had casual sex in the past while she’s only ever had sex with her ex boyfriends. She has no problem with making out, getting felt up, or even getting some clothes off. She even openly talks about past sexual experiences, teases me, etc., but when I try to escalate beyond second base she always stops me. I asked her what the problem is and she keeps saying that she feels its going “too fast” for her. Through other conversations she’s said she kind of regrets having sex with her exes.

Its getting to the point of being frustrating now, I was in a 5 month dry spell before meeting her and I haven’t been with anyone since I met her. At the end of the day I can’t and won’t force her to have sex. I understand she has certain hangups, and if she does ever have sex with me I ultimately want it to be a positive experience for her as well, but I feel like there is nothing I can say without it coming off as me pressuring her.

If it weren’t for the sex then everything else is great. She’s always caring for me, makes an effort for me, always does nice things, all my friends think she’s great, and she is very loyal. I talked to a couple of my friends and they gave me the whole “you’re not entitled to sex” lecture. In reality I don’t feel like I’m entitled to receive sex from her, but its certainly something I want. Its not all I want, but its something I want as part of the package.

WIBTA for leaving my girlfriend just because she won’t have sex with me? I kind of feel assholish for considering this, but now I don’t know what else to do.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, she told me once off when she was drunk that sometimes she wishes she waited until marriage.

"AITA for wanting my brother to see a doctor.. I recently had an arguement with my brother and his gf about how I think my brother should go see a doctor. We were on a small road trip and my brother ended up being in the bathroom for 1 hr and still had the feeling that he needed to go. Delaying lunch plans. This seems like a case for normal people is  diarrhea but this is pretty normal occurance for him in the sense that he always needs to go or he will go use the bathroom excessively. Everytime we go anywhere he needs to go and he'll be in there for a long time. Sounds less a case of IBS. My brother has great health care coverage and dental care and has not found a primary care provider /dentist and or gone to see a doctor in 7 years. He is obese and eats a diet rich in fat and protein. Basically they said it's normal he goes so much and so often and that he doesnt need to go and yeah I get that it's up to him but like going to see a medical professional once a year isnt going to kill him or interrupt work. They said what else are the docs going to do if he has ibs?. And like questioned the possibility of getting better advice than what google might give. I guess I'm fat shaming but I didn't call him fat just that he had risk factors since he is heavy and eats s poor diet etc snd like our family has a history of high cholesterol etc. Overall they're excusing it as if he shouldn't go. Also it's ironic because she is premed and I'm starting medical school so we obviously want to go into this field and help ppl. 

Edit: they also were like ""when was the last time I went? To confront me / divert the conversation to me. Thing is I went last eyar and got blood work done. (I also didn't have onsistent health care coverage this past year and they knew that) And thing I told them I admit I look like the stereotype of healthy and I acknowledge that skinny person stereotype.

"WIBTA if I called CPS on my neighbor?. Obligatory apology for formatting due to being on mobile, also, English is not my first language. 

I have a neighbour who just emotionally terrorizes her family (husband and 3 kids, youngest is 4 and her eldest is 12. The 12 year old gets the brunt of her verbal tirades, I suspect he's the scapegoat child, always being called worthless, useless, etc. She screams so loud I can hear her even with my sliding glass door closed (we live in apartments). As far as I know, she doesn't get physical with her husband or kids, but the names she calls them and that loud screeching can't be good for their mental health. 

I also suspect neglect, because she sits at her computer all day live streaming her games (there's a window in the computer room, she's seldom seen out of it unless she's tearing apart the household ranting and yelling), and getting drunk at night loudly (and horribly) singing songs to her live stream audience. She screams at her kids if they so much ask her to make them meals, and demands her oldest cook for them. They're diet consists of mostly boxed mac n cheese or ramen noodles, or anything easily prepared by a 12 year old. 

The husband comes home from work, cleans up after her and the kids, then cooks dinner on the BBQ. He has a pretty quiet and shy demeanor (probably worn the frick down), as I never hear him yell back at her when she's screeching at him. Her mom comes over once a week to deep clean her house for her. She doesn't currently have a job. I've heard her yell at her husband that if he leaves, he'll never see the kids and he will be ""stuck paying child support for the rest of his life"". 

I'm on the fence about potentially tearing a family apart, but hearing her yell and scream at her family on an almost daily basis is pushing me towards getting those children help. WIBTA if I called CPS?

Edit; Thank you for weighing in, I will be calling CPS. I think I had my reservations at first because I had a similar upbringing, and I was hoping to ascertain whether or not I was overreacting due to my own pstd. It seems part of my brain normalized this since it isn't physical.

I (F27) recently began a new Youtube channel that has been accumulating a steady amount of followers, most of whom are just perfect and civil, and I try to engage them whenever possible. But there is one account owner that has been particularly clingy, messaging me a lot initially and with growing frequency. His messages were a bit TMI at times but it was friendly enough.

"AITA for telling my mother until she is a better person that I won't be in contact with her?. I'm on mobile sorry if this ends up weird. 

TLDR at the bottom. 

I grew up super liberal. My mom worked in social services and I get her love of human services and love of the people from her. She used to be so helpful and sweet and caring. 

Several years ago she had a mental breakdown/ midlife crisis and became super racist, transphobic, anti immigrants, blah blah blah. This was fine since she would usually refrained from talking about this stuff in front of me. 

But now she is very open about it and it's honestly sickening. I recently made a status on Facebook along the lines of ""if you vote conservative in this election you do not get to say you love or support me"" and listed the reasons like anti gay, cutting social programs which means losing government funded jobs like mine, anti women's rights, etc. 

My mom commented on it and went ballistic and was arguing with my friends and being racist towards them and cussing everyone out and being just awful. Nobody was antagonizing her either. She then texted me and also freaked out calling me a Nazi among other names. 

I am so done at this point with her prejudice and racist crap, I told her she can talk to me when she decides to be a decent human being and until then I'm not talking to her. 

She's calling me an asshole and a Nazi, and my sister texted me telling me I'm being a jerk and that ""she's my mom I have to love her and I can just cut her out"".

"AITA for kicking out my friend and his pregnant girlfriend?. So, not long ago, a friend of mine and his girlfriend needed a place to stay. I invited them to rent a room in my home, they quickly agreed, we moved forward, it's been mostly good. I work from home, so this is my home and my office, but I've been trying to respect that they live here too and this can be used as their living space.

Now, we don't have any kind of lease, or rental agreement, or anything formal like that, this was just an invitation for them to come and stay in my home since they needed a cheap place to live.

"AITA for letting my family build me a bedroom and refusing to help?. A little background here, I(22f) still live with my parents while I finish up my last year of school, then plan to move out and get my own place. We recently moved into a fixer-upper, where my dad is the only one who wanted to do any construction work, but I was left without a room and my bed has been in the dining room for the past few months.

The problem is that the two new bedrooms will be built in the unfinished basement, and we are literally building four new walls, ceilings, and installing flooring ourselves. I am expected to help build these rooms, holding up drywall, nailing in ceiling boards, and helping my dad use power tools. The problem is that I was diagnosed last year with a chronic muscle disease where basically, I can do the thing, but will regret it later. A couple of times now I told my family I could not help with a task, but was told ""it's your room. You can't just walk away and let us do the work. You're so lazy.""

A co-worker, let’s call her Chloe (27F), of mine (25F) sadly lost her grandfather earlier this month; she was off work for about 3 weeks then returned on Monday. On Wednesday she was having a rubbish day so I went out to sit with her for lunch outside. As we were eating, she thanked me for coming to sit with her and said that she enjoys being outside as she feels closer to her grandfather because he loved the outdoors and he can see her from heaven. I told her that was a lovely way to think of it. 

She then asked me if I had any similar beliefs and I told her I don’t. She began on at me about how the idea of her grandfather watching her from heaven has really helped her cope with his death and that I should look to sky once in a while and picture my loved ones smiling down at me. I suffered the loss of a loved one earlier this year and didn’t want to think about it then and there. I thanked her for her suggestion but explained that I have grieved in my own ways and said that I’m not sure what I believe about the afterlife. Her mood changed and she got defensive and asked me *“Don’t know about the afterlife? So you don’t believe in heaven?”* I said I don’t and then she got angry and asked *“So you don’t think my grandad is in heaven? Where do you think he is? Did he not deserve to go to heaven?”* I tried to slide the question with *“you have your beliefs so what does it matter what I think?”* but that wasn’t enough for her. She told me that I’m insulting my loved ones by denying them being in heaven. I then got annoyed and was a little curt when I replied *“I don’t believe in a heaven and hell because I don’t think life is that black and white, I’m not even sure if I believe in any kind of life after death. I don’t like worrying about death and the unknown; I’d rather focus on life and the living”*. She started to cry and walked off back to work.

The plan is for her to come to the UK for six months and if it all works out they’ll get married. He has three children with his ex and lives in a rented apartment.


A couple of days ago he asked me to be a guarantor for his medical bill. He promises that he will be able to pay the bill and has said he’ll do extra shifts to pay for it. He is having a reverse vasectomy because he wants to have a child with the Filipino woman because she has no children. The procedure costs about £2775 with monthly payments of £198. He has deposited £400. The procedure isn’t available on the NHS and therefore he has to go private. 


He went for a pre-op assessment today and has put down the deposit and is now waiting for my answer as to whether I’ll act as guarantor. I feel like I’m being backed into a corner without being given time to think about it. I’ve only seen him briefly at work as we work different shifts so haven’t had time to meet up to talk about it.


I have several issues with this: 


1) He has a track record of never having a lot of money left at the end of each month. He has a poor credit score and can barely afford to support himself and his current children. He says he will do extra night shifts to cover the costs. This means he will be spending even less time with his children, which concerns me as I feel they should come first. He currently only has his children for three nights a week.


2) He is currently paying for a bike that he bought on credit and already owns some expensive racing bikes. I would therefore question whether he is living beyond his means.


3) The woman hasn’t even had her visa application accepted yet so may still be refused entry to the UK. Several people have said that they believe she’s just after a visa. I can see their point as it all seems to be moving so fast. He seems to be putting this woman before his current children. It could be said that he’s letting his heart rule his head.  I would also question whether she is coercing him into having the procedure done.


4) He hasn’t spoken to his parents about it. I’m therefore led to believe that he feels they may try talking him out of it and therefore asked me as he sees me as a safe bet. 


I am applying for a mortgage and am concerned that a lender may argue there’s a risk that I may have to pay the debt and therefore my affordability score will be affected. 


I just feel that the financial risks to myself are too high considering his poor credit history, poor financial management and the situation with this woman and would strongly advise him to wait until later in his relationship and maybe during that time save money for the procedure rather than taking out any loans etc. 


Tl:dr friend wants me to be his guarantor but I have my concerns.


Am I being unreasonable for not wanting to be a guarantor?","NTA, you're never the asshole for not wanting to financially stick your neck out for someone.

"AITA for forgetting my dad’s coffee?. I was told to cross post this here. AITA for forgetting my father’s coffee?

  This happened today. My family and I have been planning a vacation to the Bahamas. It’s just my parents and I and we have all always wanted to go. We started planning it almost a year ago and we have all been so excited for it. 

  Dad HAS to have his morning coffee. He just has to. He’s like a demon if he doesn’t get it. While my dad went to pick up some last minute items for our trip while my mom showered and got dressed. I was supposed to get his coffee ready so we could go to the airport as soon as he got back. 

  The coffee is brewing as my mother gets out of the shower. The coffee pot is right by the sink. My mom comes over with me by the sink once she got dressed and we were talking about the trip. I went to pour my dad’s coffee and the lid came off of the coffee pot and the coffee went all over the floor and barely missed my shoes. I freaked out and cleaned the coffee up as quick as possible. But before I could get another pot of coffee made, I could hear my dad beeping the horn to tell us he was ready. I figured we could stop for coffee on the way to the airport. 

  Wrong. I was so wrong. My dad wanted his from home. He didn’t want ‘gas station coffee’. Fine. I really don’t care, he’ll get over it soon, I thought. We’d be in the Bahamas shortly and everything would be fine and dandy. 

 We arrive at the airport and go through all the stops and precautions. My dad has been snapping at all the employees this morning and I started getting anxious. I just felt like something bad was going to happen but I have an anxiety disorder so I just passed it off as my disorder acting up. 

  At this point we’re about to board the plane. I had never been on a plane before so I was feeling a ton of different emotions. I was feeling excited until I heard my dad freaking out on the person that tells everyone where to go to board the plane. 

  The guy was nicely telling everyone to ‘get on the plane’ as he motioned which way to go. He told my dad “this way to get on the plane, sir” and my dad LOST it. He told the guy “fuck you, man! I’m trying to get IN the plane, not ON the plane!!”  I was humiliated; my mom was crying. People were staring. It was most definitely not my disorder acting up. 

  Just to sum everything up from that point on: my dad wouldn’t calm down. Security was called. He tried pushing their buttons, also. So we were made to leave. If I would have gotten him his coffee, we would be in the Bahamas right now. Instead, I’m grounded for a week because I ‘ruined the family trip’ and I’m now allowed to go on the next one that is planned. 

TL;DR: I didn’t get my dad his coffee. He’s crazy if he doesn’t get it. He freaked out on airport security and we had to cancel our vacation because he wouldn’t calm down.","NTA

"AITA for being ""weird"" in front of my GF's client. My GF runs a family day care from our home. She uses 75% of our house for her business between 8 am and 6 pm Monday to Friday. I also work from home, so I spend most of my time in the remaining 25% of the house (which is upstairs) and I try to keep a low profile when the parents pick up or drop off their kids.

My GF asked me to interact with the parents more, for example, come downstairs and say hello and see how their day is going, etc.

Yesterday I left the house to buy alcohol and she told me that a parent is expected soon. While I was out, she sent me a text saying that a parent was here. I replied by asking to let me know when they leave. After 20 minutes she hasn't replied, so I come to the back of the house to check. My GF and the parent are at the back of the house in our kitchen and they see me. I hide the alcohol and come into the kitchen. The parent, her kid and a baby chair are blocking the hallway to upstairs. I say hello and I stand with them in the kitchen. After a few minutes everyone moves to the front of the house and I follow. The parent is leavings and I sit on the couch and look at my phone while I wait for the parent to leave so I can go and get the hidden alcohol. The parent leaves and I go get my alcohol.

I come back inside and my GF is angry at me for being weird. I ask what she is talking about and see told me that standing in the kitchen and then sitting on the couch is weird. I told her that I was blocked in the kitchen. She said that I should of asked if the parent could move so I could go upstairs.

I didn't like this for a number of reasons. She had previously asked me to interact with the parents more. This is my house too, my kitchen and couch and I should be able to use it when I like. And it would of been difficult to get past the mother and child because the child is 13 months old and is only just starting to stand up and walk and can cry at the drop of a hat. I thought it would be best to wait rather than try to squeeze past.

My GF thinks I'm the asshole for standing in the kitchen with them and sitting on the couch rather than going straight upstairs.

"AITA my friend thew a party at my house and I got mad at her.. My ex best friend asked me to use my back yard for her toddler's birthday party  with a week notice and I agreed thinking it would only take a couple hours to prepare the party, and then clean afterwards.

My friend asked me : oh, what time can I come on Friday to clean your house for the party?

Well she brought her 4 kids knowing my husband has night shift and he needs to sleep during the day, she used my pots and pans to make the food for her party and didn't wash them. She tried to make a piñata shaped cake and she had never done anything like that ever! She left the mess of cake in my fridge instead of preparing everything at her house and bringing it 2 hours before the party.
She left on Friday til 1 am and left a mess on the kitchen.

Saturday morning she comes to ""clean the house"".
Nope, she leaves my house at 10 am and comes back until 4pm because she went to buy everything else she needed for the party like decorations and ingredients for the food(the party was at 5).
My house was a wreck and she was not done decorating, I had to deal with her toddlers, her 7 year old cry baby boy and her angsty teenager all day and on top of that her father in law comes to my kitchen and starts frying tacoshels because ""they like them freshly made""
Her husband was ""taking care of the toddlers"", and he was sitting down with their 1 year old and 2 year old on the sofa.
Her 2 year old dropped a cup of horchata and her husband instead of going to the kitchen and picking up a paper towel grabbed a folded tshirt I had on the sofa and cleaned it up with my sister's brand new sports tshirt!.
He kids destroyed several of my stuff and she stayed the night on my house because she was helping me ""clean up after the party"".
She went to sleep.
In the morning of Sunday she still was here at my house ""cleaning"", I got overwhelmed and decided to sit down on the back yard with my tired husband.
She comes over and says : is everything okay?
And I hint her : I feel overwhelmed there's too much noise on my normally quiet house. (Please leave)
She takes her kids and my niece to the kids art museum to ""give me a break"".
I hint again : I get more stressed out with a dirty house than a noisy house (please clean your mess and leave).
She leaves anyways, and while she is at the museum she sends me a message : oh melanie is on her way to the museum, is it okay if we get back by 4 so she doesn't feel rushed.

"AITA for not attending holiday party at a non-kid-friendly house?. The title says it all, but...

My aunt and uncle are childless and have traveled the world for work and fun.  They’re really awesome people, always helping others and when they were living abroad they welcomed anyone who wanted to visit. 

They’ve collected a *lot* of priceless souvenirs from their travels. Antique pottery from the Middle East. Tapestries from China.  Lots of glass trinkets from Europe. Their house is like a museum. Also, their house has no guard rail on the stairs, a (functional) sliding door that opens to a two-story drop-off, and more choking hazards than I can count. 

They hosted the Christmas celebration for that side of my family, and we didn’t attend. I have a toddler, and the thought of chasing him around for 3 hours frankly gave me anxiety. Last year at Christmas, another child broke an expensive wine glass at their house, and although they were very gracious, I could tell it bothered them. 

I said it was because we had a cold (which was technically true), but was that selfish? I told a coworker about it, and she just said “yeah, there’s no such thing as a carefree holiday when you have a toddler”.  I feel like she was insinuating that I should’ve gone to the party.

"AITA For Quitting Band. Some Context:
    I've been in band since 6th grade and am now a senior in high school. I haven't enjoyed band for a few years and have tried to quit several times but got guilted into staying in band by my director and my school counselor wouldn't let me quit without talking to my director again, so I just didn't do it.

   I emailed my counselor to finally quit band once and for all because seeing as it's the summer, she can't force me to talk to my director. I got my classes all switched around and then emailed my director, which is something I had been putting off because earlier in the year, I had signed a commitment form to play in the band and I just broke the commitment by quitting. 
   
    My director emailed me back saying he is disappointed in me and how unfair it is of me to quit because of how it will affect the group (there will be a hole in the marching show now), and how the school spends thousands of dollars for them to go to those shows (the group could possibly lose points for there being a hole) and it's unfair for the group as a hole to lose points because I quit. 

    I really feel like an asshole because of the points he brought up (and also the fact that I hate letting people down, especially teachers), but at the same time I tried fo quit before, and with quitting band, I can focus more on my grades.

"AITA for not letting my boyfriend take a picture of me?. I had to go pick up a dress this morning, and I brought my boyfriend along to get it. On the way, he says he's gonna take a picture of me in it (I don't wear anything fancier than blue jeans most of the time), and I tell him not to.

So we get to the bridal shop, and I ask for it. While she searches, me and BF start talking about it. He mentions at one point how I never feel like dressing up nice. (Which is true.)

The girl finds the dress and asks if I want to try it on. I'm curious to see how it looks in its proper color, so me and him head over to the dressing room. I get in it and go out to show him. 

Now at this point, I'll admit, I don't think I look good. The dress looks fine, but still needs altering (it's long and I'm not), my hair's a mess, I have a very exposed bra strap due to the dress style. Just- no effort, just want to see how the pink looks. He compliments me all over for it, and before I turn around to go back, I see his phone raising up. I immediately turn it down and hear a click of the phone shutter. Immediately remind him that for the last time, I didn't want that, I don't look good. ""But Verdant, you look fine!"" Well, I don't feel fine, please respect my wishes and knock that off.

"AITA for “taking advantage” of my husband to re-train for another job?.   

I’m very unhappy with my job/industry. I earn ok (not bad) money doing it, but my view is it’s simply not worth the unhappiness that it is causing me, which is affecting the other parts of my life. Other fields I could possibly transfer to using my experience are not fields I want to be in - it would just be more of the same issue. I’ve tried many different ways to accept my job/industry and be happier (promotion, getting therapy etc.), but it is not working.

I can re-train to do something I know I would enjoy – become a therapist. I’ve wanted to do this for a long time. It wouldn’t ever earn great money but I would be fulfilled. My plan after training is to work part-time in my current job to focus on building my therapy business, with the hope that I’d get enough work that I could do it full-time one day (or at least most of the time). 

The catch is that the training is VERY expensive and takes a few years, and there is no guarantee that I would find much work afterwards (building my own business and/or finding employment as a therapist). It would put a big financial strain on my husband and I and we’d have to make sacrifices by cutting our expenses down to the bone e.g. we would not be able to have any vacations, rarely if ever eat out at restaurants or celebrate occasions etc. We would also have to delay having kids which is something we’ve both looked forward to (though hopefully that wouldn’t be a problem from a biological perspective).

While we are both very apprehensive about the financial strain, he is doing his best to be supportive. However a close friend says I am “almost taking advantage” of my husband and ""sacrificing” his happiness for my own. They say that I am forcing him to choose me over financial stability, and forcing him to sacrifice a huge amount in terms of financial stability and lifestyle. They also said as my husband is already the breadwinner now, it puts a lot of pressure on him as I will be spending a huge amount on training while also bringing less money in after. Both of our salaries would be necessary for us to live comfortably and save money for a rainy day.

So in a month our lease is up and we both didn’t want to stay in our current apartment because we dislike the landlord. We told his parents and they gave him a budget of $600. So we agreed to move and we found another place we both liked very quickly. 

The only problem with this place is you have to pay for your parking spot. I’m the only one with a car but my BF is CONSTANTLY driving it. Maybe even more than me. So its an extra $200 on the rent a month for the space. Without the parking space our new place would be about $100 cheaper then our current place. 

So we told his parents rent would be $1200 with a parking space and they asked why would they be paying for parking when I was the only one with a car.

However, my brother who has been six years sober is attempting to regain custody of his two.  He isn’t necessarily able to get the youngest two as they aren’t biologically his.  My youngest niece is seven. Again she’s not biologically mine but she’s been my niece since she was born.  She lived with me when she came home from the hospital along with her mother. Anyway, she told me recently multiple times that she wanted to live with me because her sister (11) beats her up all the time and tells her she’s unwanted.  My sweet seven year old niece told me that’s terrified that her biological dad (an abusive sex offender) will come steal her away because that’s what her sister tells her. And that her real mom and dad don’t love her and that’s why they don’t see her, all because my biological niece tells her this. 

I asked my mother if I could adopt her. I live in a different state. I’m in the military and I have two children on my own. My reasons were to get her away from her abusive sister and my abusive mother, to offer her a home with a mother and a father in it, and to give her something that she doesn’t think was given out of obligation, something that nobody can ever take away.  

My mother screamed and cussed me when we talked about this. “How dare you try to take her Way from me.” The evidence for how much better quality of life can b me for a child with a mother and a father is staggering, but my mother wouldn’t hear anything.   

tl;dr - I want to adopt my niece because my mother is a crazy person.  She said I’m an asshole for suggesting it.  ","NTA. If you can't prove abuse, I don't know if you can. You can ask r/legaladvice for help.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for ghosting a guy ?. So I met this guy not so long ago, we didn't talk much but we exchanged number then I went on with my day like usual. We then texted for a bit but he starts asking for us to call or to meet (he lives in the city, I don't and I don't have my driving lesson so I can only go there via bus which is a whole really annoying thing). 

I have bad anxiety and I'm really not comfortable speaking on the phone, I also don't know him much like we just talked for two minutes to exchange number and only exchanged a couple of texts about where we come from so I don't feel like going to meet him right away. I insist to chat more via SMS but apparently he can't do that because his phone plan doesn't cover SMS but only phone calls and he doesn't have wifi to speak via a chat app. So basically he can only talk by phone or IRL and both of those options makes me really uncomfortable and anxious. He seems really into me but to be honest I'm not really, I'd just like to talk to make a friend because I don't have that many friends and I like talking and meeting new people platonically so anyway, I'm not really extremely attached. So I told him that since I didn't feel comfortable talking via phone calls or seeing each other IRL, I felt a bit pressured and ""I think we should probably stop talking anymore"" (that's the precise words I used). 

But he keeps sending me messages and I assume it's because he either didn't understand (he's from another country and doesn't seem like he knows the language extremely well) or he changed his phone plan and found a way to talk more via SMS but now it kinda gives me anxiety just talking via sms because I'm scared I'll feel pressured again to talk via phone or see him which I don't feel comfortable with. So I've been ghosting him and not responding to his new messages. I feel like it's probably okay because I did tell him that I didn't think we should talk anymore, it's not really out of nowhere. But maybe it wasn't clear enough so I don't really know. What do you think ?","NTA. You didn’t ghost him. You told him you wanted to stop and he ignored that.

"AITA for not sharing my food?. (I understand this isn’t nearly as severe as some others on this sub, but people have been dropping me for being “selfish” and I don’t understand what I did wrong”

Backstory: One of my closest friends, let’s call her G. G is a great girl, but her family is abusive. Verbally, and up until this year, physically. I beg her to tell someone but it’s been getting better so she doesn’t want to be removed from our school, as it is private because her family is paying for it. Another classmate, let’s call her Z owns a bakery. I ordered a dozen cupcakes. (They were pretty good)

That’s enough backstory

Basically, I made sure I had enough for the people I care about most before I gave them out to whoever asked. G was on this list for most cared for. I gave her the cupcake before first period and was greatful. Throughout the day I gave them to my other friends, my sister, and a few teachers. By the end of the day I had one left and was saving that for my mom. 

G’s mom says that she is fat (she is not fat, she’s not on the skinny side, but by no means overweight) so she cannot eat too much.

I told her I was going to give it to my mom. (I had texted my mom before and then checked my phone at this point. She didn’t want it.) She said it was so good and she wanted the last one. I told her I’m sorey but I had another friend in our final period that hadn’t gotten one and wanted it. So I gave it to him. 

She was still complaining, almost crying because she wanted that last cupcake. I went and got her a bag of her favorite chips because I felt bad. She was still pissed. Granted, this friend was not as close as me and G, but she said that I was a terrible friend.

I didn’t think I did wrong because that’s not fair, but her friends have been calling me an Asshole and other things, because I didn’t give her the last cupcake. AITA?","NTA- it’s a cupcake, and g needs to grow up.",0,0,0,0,1

"AITA for never reaching out to my bio father because I thought he didn’t care?. 
Update. 

I don’t even know where to begin. My bio dad called after I had contacted him and he was unbelievable. The grace and love he showed brought me to tears. After giving up his rights to allow me to be raised in a single family home and not split it up he has waited all this time for me to contact him. He cried on the phone with me and sounded more excited than anyone ever. I don’t even know how to handle this. We are communicating now and hopefully meeting in the near future for the first time in 20 years. Thanks everyone for the encouragement it was what I needed to contact him. 



Original post 

my mother had me with a man she was in a relationship with years ago. She moved away he came to visit and voila I show up. From what I understand now he came to visit me a couple of times. My father came into the picture when I was 3 and they got married when I was 4. They took it to court to have my father adopt me and biodad fought it. 

I never knew he fought it and he also brought me presents when he came which I just received yesterday (I’m currently 23). I feel so torn because my whole life I didn’t care about this man or his family (I have a step brother and two step sisters from him). My mother always instilled he didn’t care and my father did so much for me it would be a slap in his face to ever meet this man or anything of the like. 

Now I agree completely that just cause you get a woman pregnant doesn’t make you a father. Especially if you walk away and don’t try. I wouldn’t think twice about it. However this man tried and I was never told until now. 

So I guess my question is am I the asshole for never reaching out? And is it to late for me to try. Or am I being the asshole to my current fam who I love very much if I reached out? Especially my father who has been amazing my whole life.","NTA. You didn't know. It's not too late for you to try. Given how much he fought to keep you I think he'd forgive that.

"WIBTA if I don't cancel my Spartan Race for my Nephew's First Communion. I'm feeling like a huge asshole at the moment, but I don't know what to do.  I love running Spartan Races, I ran my first in November and was completely hooked.  So on Black Friday I bought the Trifecta Pass, which is 3 races, each a different difficulty, and if you complete all 3 within a calendar year (so 2020) you get a special medal.

I've been training nonstop for this 6 days a week, trying to get ready.  The races were also $150 apiece, and are nonrefundable. There's also only a select few in my area per difficulty.  So in reality either I run this specific race, or I lose out on the Trifecta medal, lose $400+, and have to wait an entire calendar year (and invest another $450) to get the Trifecta medal.

&#x200B;

However I just realized that my Nephew's first communion is that day.  I'm not religious whatsoever, but it's a big family event and I do want to be there.  But it's legitimately going to be my entire family (12+) in a church watching him from far away.  He's only 7 and definitely doesn't want to be there, and most likely won't even notice I'm not there.  But my family is beyond pissed at me, and I feel like the biggest asshole.

If the race was refundable, movable, or anything else I would definitely move it, but I don't know if setting myself back hundreds of dollars and having to move my own personal goals back an entire year is worth the hour-long event.","NTA, your nephew doesn't care, you're not religious, and you have something more important to do.

"WIBTA if I asked my parents in law to stop posting pictures of me on social media?. TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’m F/25, recently married. I’ve known my husbands parents for a long time as my husband and I have been in a relationship for 8 years. MIL/FIL and I have always gotten along great, they are wonderful people. 

The one thing I cannot stand though is documenting everything we do on Facebook/IG. I deleted all my social media accounts 4 years ago and have never been happier. I never realized how much social anxiety it caused me to have pictures of me out there/people knowing what I was doing/where I was going constantly. 

This annoyance started around our wedding. I would get back our engagement photos/bridal shower pics/wedding photos and instantly MIL would upload all of them to Facebook. This annoyed me because I am extremely picky with pictures and basically just wanted to show my parents/close friends/his family a select few of MY wedding pictures, not have our album of 100+ private wedding pictures posted online for people I don’t even know to see. MIL has quite a following and I had people texting me about the pictures that I’m not even close to, I was like WTF. 

Recently, they visited my husband and I from out of state. MIL always asks us to get in for pictures wherever we go and takes a bunch. Both husband and I are annoyed by this and we like to just be out enjoying the day, and often leave our phones at home to unplug. We went out hiking and obviously were all sweaty after a 6 hour hike. At the end, I took a few pics of her and her husband and son together because she asked me to on her phone and I don’t mind at all. They asked me to get in a few, also which was fine but I specifically asked to not be posted because #1: I run this trail very often and do NOT like people knowing my regular routes. #2 this may be selfish but I am just straight up not a fan of taking sweaty workout pics and posting for the world to see.... 

So after I made this request they joked with me “oh there going to be all over Facebook/IG etc” I laughed along and was like whatever but please don’t. They both always make fun of me that I hate pictures/social media and don’t get it because “you look great in pictures it doesn’t matter” etc.  It bugs me they don’t take me seriously even though it causes me anxiety anytime we go anywhere and I know they’ll be posting about it (mostly MIL). It’s almost as if I’m weird I don’t want to be on social media? 

Literally the next day my husband showed me at least 10 pics of us were uploaded to FB with our location/time of the hike, had 150+ likes and 30 comments. It’s not so much how I look in them as I really dislike a bunch of randos knowing where I am, what we are doing as a family and when, etc. I’m just extremely private and enjoy having my business be my business. 

Would I be the asshole to bring up this issue or do I just need to get over it? 

TL;DR husbands parents post pics of me/social media posts of whatever we do and it makes me super uncomfortable. WIBTA to ask not post with me in it?","NTA, but you can thoroughly expect your boundaries to be disrespected and it to likely turn into a huge ordeal.

"AITA for making my sister pay for my damaged jacket?. Me and my sister always had a great relationship (I am 22, she's 18), she's one of the best people in my life, along with my parents and my boyfriend, but even if I care about her very much, I really can't stand anymore how disrespectful she is of other people's property. In the past, she already took and carelessly damaged many of my clother without even telling me, of course I got angry at her, but she always answered it's not that big deal and that I was overreacting. 
The last straw was when I recently discovered she damaged a North Face jacket I have since I was 16 by leaving chewed gum and cotton pads in a pocket. I confronted her and said that this time I pretend she buys me a new one, so maybe next time she will take proper care of other people's possessions: she flipped over and started to scream at me that i was, once again, overreacting and being childish. I said to her that I would be happy even with a used item, since North Face clothes are expensive, but I held my ground on the fact that this time she needs to somewhat make up for her mistake. 
It would be quite a big expense for her and I feel guilty and materialistic asking to spend that money for me, but at the same time I want to stop her careless behaviour.

"AITA for not doing my mom a favor and driving illegally to give my sister her school lunch?. I dunno if this is a big enough problem compared to others I've read on here, but I do kinda feel guilty about it and I want your guys' opinions.

So I've been driving unlicensed for a while (before you ask, I failed my drivers test twice now), but if I'm alone, only within my neighbourhood and if I'm  anywhere outside of my neighbourhood, someone with a license always goes with me. My parents are quite strict on this rule as they fear the repercussions if a traffic cop catches me, which I completely respect.

So today my dumb sister forgot her lunch at home and had nothing to eat for the entire day, so she texted us to come bring it to her at school. My mom then asked me to do it and I was more than willing to do it, but i just wanted to clarify with my mom what this would in turn mean; if I can drive alone, outside of my neighbourhood for what my mom needed me to do, then I can drive alone, outside of my neighbourhood for stuff i wanna do. Cause in my eyes, that's fair, as they can't allow me to risk my future drivers license for their needs, and not allow me to risk it for stuff that I need or wanna do.

My mom when hearing this instead flipped on me and then got passive aggressive with me and said, ""I'll just do it; I don't have time for a debate or this bullshit.""

Maybe my tone was too aggravating, but I still feel I did nothing wrong.

"AITA for being angry my fiance's dad wants me to re-propose. So my girlfriend and I went to the beach last Thursday and on Friday night after a wonderful day of swimming and hanging out and enjoying our favorite beach, we went to our favorite restaurant and had a great meal. When we were done eating,  we walked onto a pier near the restaurant and watched as the sun set. The atmosphere was very romantic and we had been dating happily for nearly 5 years. Judging the moment to be perfect, I got down on one knee and proposed.  She said yes and was over the moon happy and excited  and we didn't even leave the pier for another two hours because she didn't want the moment to end. She spent the rest of the weekend on cloud 9 and we finally pack up and go home. Here's where the problem starts. 


She personally tried to call her parents on Friday night after it happened but it was bad timing for the parents to talk. After trying again Saturday she's decided we'd tell them in person instead. So we waited for Sunday. We make a cute card for them to surprise them and give them it. Their reaction isn't particularly enthusiastic but no big deal. At first we thought it went well on the whole, but then her father says ""wait a minute you need to ask my permission before you propose. "" So he decides I need to redo the proposal at a large family get together next week and publicly ask ""to talk to him"" before doing so and then propose in front of her whole family. I wouldn't mind that much, but this will basically erase our previous, perfect, real proposal with a fake proposal to suit his desires. 

Presently I am considering just going along with the request to keep things from getting escalated in a negative way and I'm positive if I just do what he wants he'll leave it alone after that. But if I'm honest with myself, I am LIVID that he fucked up our perfect engagement weekend for his personal preference and I'm not sure how to proceed without blowing up my relationship with her parents ( which has been pretty good up to this point). Suggestions are welcome. AITA?

"AITA for getting mad at my DH for not getting it together for my birthday dinner with my family?. First time poster, long time lurker. 

This happened yesterday afternoon. My aunt and uncle had just moved back from across the country after being gone for 6 years. This was the first birthday I got to spend with them in a long time. I’m very close with my aunt, my dad’s sister. My uncle is very lovely and funny too, I was excited to see him. They are both elderly and their health is in really bad shape. My parents are in their 70’s and I try to spend time with them as much as I can. Long back story my dad is in poor health and my mom cares for him. I’m so grateful to have all them together for my birthday dinner. Cue my DH. He’s been under the weather for about a week with a cough. He was still not feeling good as we got ready to meet everyone for dinner. I asked if I could get him anything, he said no. He was basically silent all the way to the restaurant, it was an hour drive. I tried the whole time to be friendly and try to engage him. He either gave me one word answers or said nothing. We make it to the restaurant and he is still basically silent. We help my dad with his walker into the restaurant while mom parks. I sit at our table and DH sits a couple seats down from me. I’m confused and a little hurt. He told me I should move so my dad and aunt can easily sit. I move. Aunt is now in a wheelchair so mom and I help her into a chair. The entire dinner he maybe speaks 5 words. My mom is sitting next to him and she keeps trying to engage him and he gives one word answers. My dad tried and he did the same thing with him. My uncle finally says hey DH are you okay? DH grumbled and said he was fine. His attitude was so hostile everyone could feel it. It put a huge damper on the whole dinner. It was so awful. I was so embarrassed. This was the first time we have gotten together in 6 years and DH acts like a sullen brat. I get he didn’t feel good but get it together for an hour.

"WIBTA for snitching on a friend who had intentions of cheating on her fiancé?. So I have a relatively new friend that I’ve only met up with a few times. In two weeks, she’s supposed to get married. Since the first time we’ve met, she’s expressed hesitations about it and has mentioned that she wishes she has time to explore being single because she’s always been in relationships. I totally understand those hesitations, and acknowledge that people can develop crushes while in a relationship. However, this weekend was her bachelorette weekend. She invited a guy that she’s been talking to that she’s crushing on. At the end of the night, he went home and she was actually mad that he didn’t end up going home with her. All this time I had figured it was a joke that had gone a bit far, but she was dead serious in that she really wanted to take this guy home and sleep with him.

So my dilemma is, would I be the asshole for telling her fiancé, or his sister who was here this weekend that she intended on cheating, even though it didn’t actually happen? I’ve never met her fiancé, and since nothing actually happened, I feel in ways like it’s not my place to say anything.

"AITA - for not telling my dad that my mum cheated on him, before they broke up and got divorced.. When I was 18, I found a letter that my mum had written to somebody she worked with in another country. It details how she loved him, and that although they couldn't be together, she doesn't know why he is being cold with her after having sex. She goes on to say how she doesn't love my father anymore, but that he is a great father. However she wanted to stay with him until my younger brother finished school.

To add context, my mother worked away alot, but as a result she earned a substantial salary in the years leading up to the split. My father held a full time job, with half the salary, but took the majority of the childcare/housework when we were growing up. Furthermore, the divorce was ugly! If I remember correctly, it took around a year, and my mum wouldn't agree on a 50/50 split of the assets (around a $1million). All the while I knew that she had cheated, and that my father could use it to leverage a better deal. Yet I never told anyone.

A few years down the line, in the present, both are happy with other partners. However, my father took a few years to get over it, entering a bout of depression.

I (26m) was arriving home with my partner (27f) after a night out, we were both a bit drunk. Cannot recall exactly how we got onto the conversation (both a bit drunk), but my partner basically said that my mum doesn't like her, because my mum is a shit feminist and doesn't like ambitious women because my mum didn't have a stellar career. Background: my mum and partner don't get on (that's another story for /MIL).

I responded (I would say 'pretty calmly') that what she'd said had really upset me, and that one of the key reasons my mum didn't have a high-flying career was that my parents messily split up when I was young and she had to work and raise me and my older brother. I said 'yeah, my mum isn't perfect and can be kind of petty, but she raised me and my brother whilst working full time, which is hella impressive if you ask me (my brother and I are only *mildly* messed up, so pretty successful). So I have quite a strong response when you put down my mum.'

My partner get very upset, said that she was only repeating something I had said before (I don't recall saying my mum doesn't like ambitious women/people, but I may have done), said I was making her feel bad and blaming her for something she was just repeating, and then burst into tears.

So that was yesterday and she hasn't spoken to me in any meaningful way yet. I feel bad, because I made her cry, and may have come across as aggressive when I was just trying to be firm. But am still upset about what she said.

So, AITA? Any suggestions on how to go about repairing this would be appreicated also.",NTA she insulted your mom calling her a shit feminist and then cried when you stood up for your mom. Ive had enough drunk discussions like this with my husband including where Ive been in the wrong in a similar way as her lol BUT if she does feel bad a little love would be nice for her I guess.

"AITA for not wanting to do my MIL’s laundry?. She hasn’t had a washer and dryer in years, her apartment isn’t set up for one, they have one at her complex but “her wrists are weak” and she “can’t stand for that long,” according to my husband. Which may be true. He’s been doing her laundry for 15+ years. Now that we’re married, we’ve been doing it the last year at the laundromat. Now we have a washer and dryer and I told him I didn’t sign up to do her laundry, so he can bring it over and do it. I also do a lot of the chores around the house and feel I shouldn’t have to add hers to my list, but he’s been helping when I ask (mostly doing it right) recently. He said I did sign up because I married him. Am I a jerk for not wanting to do his mother’s laundry?

"AITA I don't think my Ex deserves any money back. Short version : my ex keeps trying to get money back from a gamestop trade in we did. I don't want to give him anything. 

Details:
So it starts back to when I helped him get a 3ds and pokemon ultra game. He put down 50$ I think and then I put in about $25 in gamestop points and then paid the rest myself.

Fast forward. He says that he's tired of the game and doesn't want to play anymore. He was interested in getting the switch because DS is obviously getting no more attention and he wanted to play games with me since I had on. I tell him we can trade it in along with some PS game and other stuff I don't use anymore and get can get you started on Your way with store credit.
 Note at this time he doesn't have a job so he can't afford one but I set this up so that when he did get a job he wouldn't have to pay as much.

Anyway he still doesn't get a job and we end up breaking up. I use the store credit to get myself some pre-orders between being upset and him saying before we broke up that it was ok for me to use the credit to get my stuff if I wanted to anyway. (if it makes any difference credit came up too $100+)

So about 2 weeks after the break up he asks if I still have the credit. (still no job didn't bother asking why he wanted it). Told him no I used it already. And now yesterday one of his friends told me if there was any way he could get some money back on the value of the DS.

I don't want to give him anything and I don't plan on it because A) I didn't force him to buy it he wanted it and I helped him get it and B) I paid for most of it while we were Dating. Now that we aren't I don't feel like I owe him anything anyway.

Wrong or not?","I want to try to break this down to make sure I have it right. 

**While dating**: 

- He puts down $50 for a 3DS and a Pokemon game. 
- You put down the rest, which I'm guessing is $150 or so. 
- Fast forward, he gets tired of the game, and wants a Switch instead. 
- Cool, you guys say you can trade it in with some of YOUR stuff you don't use anymore, because he's jobless. You get store credit so that it can be used when he finally decides to get his shit together and gets a job. He doesn't get a job, and you dump him. 

**Post-breakup**

- The store credit that you got from trading in all of the stuff he returned is used to purchase games for yourself. 
- He wants you to give him the store credit that was used to return his 3DS. The machine you put $150 down on, as well as a bunch of other games you owned. 

So now this piece of work wants you to pay him back for something he contributed a grand total of ""fuck all"" to? Is he dreaming? NTA",0,0,0,0,1

"AITA for not being a taxi service for my step daughter. Edit #2: thanks everyone for your comments, issue resolved by some car swapping so I only have to do one trip not both. Everyone happy, no arguments and kids none the wiser. Just wanted to be sure I wasn't overreacting. Thanks for the support!

Edit: sorry did not mean for this to be so long!

Background: Stepdaughter (SD) is 5. My husband and I have 1 and 2 year old boys together. Not much drama in the whole blended family situation now. I leave parenting of my SD to them but look after her about 40% of the time because I'm home with the boys and everyone else is at work. When not being cared for by me my SD is cared for by a nanny at her Mums house. I get along fine with my husbands ex wife and actively avoid any drama because it's about the kids and not our shit.

We've always had SD Wednesday arvo/night and return Thursday morning. I always used to do the pick ups and drop offs because I was working at home so didn't mind the hour round trip myself. Then I was doing it with a newborn, then pregnant with a baby in tow, then with a newborn and toddler. I got to the point I couldn't hack it and told my husband he would have to work something out or quit the Wednesday night visits because the trip with 2 kids in Sydney traffic was killing us. Many times over these years the Nanny would show up half an hour late with a ""oh sorryyyy"".

Husband arranged to work from home Wednesdays and started doing the pick ups and drop offs himself. Now he has a new job, no work from home Wednesday. I agreed to take on the Wednesday/Thursday pickups again as it'll only be until the end of the year...on the understanding that I'm the only one who can do it. Parents at work and Nanny doesn't have a car.

Yesterday was the first Wednesday. I get there to pick her up, with both my kids in tow to find both the Nanny and SD's mother home with her. I collect her, stay chat for 10, the boys have a run around. Slightly annoyed because either her Mother or THE PAID NANNY could have got in the car and driven her to our place much easier than me towing two toddlers in 30 degrees. Anyway, just dismiss it and carry on. 

This morning I get a message, can I get her home by 9am (sure I'll drive in peak hour, fun!) because the mother has organized a playdate with this social media fashion influencer a**hole who she thinks will increase her social value. I get there at 10 because 3 kids, peak hour and fuck them. Then find the Nanny and mother BOTH HOME AGAIN DOING SHIT ALL. 

They have a car, two adults and no other kids yet they let me drive an hour two days in a row with two toddlers to pick up the 5 year old they're supposed to have shared care for.

I told my husband I'm sick of being played for a fool and picking up everyone's slack. She is also engaged and her partner has NEVER helped with getting SD around.

I've always helped out where I can because I love my SD and my boys adore her and I do it for my husband and our family....but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. Am I the asshole?",NTA. You love her enough to do more for her than her biological mother is doing but with two other little kids it sounds exhausting. She definitely needs to step it up.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for not helping my roommate move in?. So this happened a couple of years ago in college but it still bothers me today.

I moved in the day before into the dorm room. It was just me and my mom so we had to make multiple trips and set everything up by ourselves. Needless to say, I did not want to do anything more with my part of the room. The next day, my roommate moves in. She has her mom, mom's bf, brother, sister, and sister's bf all helping her. While this is going on I am sitting on my bed with my ear buds in. Nobody asked me to help and I figured I would just be in the way as she already had an entourage. As I'm sitting, her mom takes a picture of me and laughs. After a while, they had mostly cleared out and my roommate had a couple of things to move with her mom and sister. They asked for my help and I got up and helped them. They made jokes about how I was finally helping. It bothered me but I figured whatever.

Later, like, months later, I'm at her house for a party and in front of everyone her parents bring up how I never helped them move. Her mom's bf referred to me as the roommate who just laid in bed watching Netflix while they moved in. And the thing is, they always bring it up, every time I see them. The joke's a bit old by now. And her mom shows the picture of me on my bed.

Was I the asshole for not helping while I had already moved all of my stuff? And at the end, when they did ask, I got up and helped. It just really bothers me 2 years later.

"AITA for calling the police in a hypothetical murder situation?. Today a buddy of mine called me up and told me he gotten me a gift and that we should get dinner; he brought his girlfriend, who'd dated for a while and am still friends with. We go to the outdoor patio of a coffee place and he shows me the gift: a pipe, some tobacco and matches. 

While he's showing me to smoke the pipe, his girlfriend mentions that she occasionally smokes cigarettes, and he's bewildered because she'd told him she didn't like smoking. She says that she doesn't, but she's mainly a social smoker. He gets mad that she lied to him, and they leave a few minutes later. I stay for a bit, finish the tobacco that's in the pipe, and leave.

Getting into my car, I get a call from him. He'd said that they might come back later, so this isn't *too* unexpected. I answer, and he asks me where I am in a panicked voice. He sounds like he's freaking out, and I'm thinking that they've broken up or something. I tell him to calm down and tell me what's up, he screams into the phone, breathes a bit, and then says that he's got a dead body in the car. That they started arguing and he stabbed her.

At this point, I start panicking. Telling him that he fucked up, that I don't know what the fuck to do, this whole time I'm asking him if he's fucking with he or not, he insists that he's serious. After a good five minutes, he starts laughing. It was a joke, she's there with him, the patched things up.

I call him a dick, laugh a bit, and tell him that I was literally a couple seconds from hanging up and calling the cops. At this point he gets mad that I wasn't gonna help him get rid of the body, says that he would have helped me, etc. Even *she* takes his side, insisting that she ""wouldn't want revenge if he did kill her"" and that calling the police would make me ""a dick and a pussy at the same time."" He sounds like he's honestly hurt and betrayed.

"AITA for lying about my faith at work?. I'm half Jewish, on my father's side, but my mother is Catholic and where we lived when I was a kid the only ""good"" schools were Catholic schools, so while I had to go through the Catholic sacraments and go to Catholic church in order to go to primary and high school, I still attended synagogue and followed many Jewish traditions growing up.

As I've gotten older I've started working at a different Catholic school, which, while they don't require you to be Catholic in order to teach there, they got kind of funny with me when they realised that despite going to Catholic schools as a child, I don't go to church very often as an adult, so I started going every now and again (maybe once a month when I know a colleague will be there) to keep up appearances. I am for all intents and purposes a practicing Catholic. I even wear a crucifix my nan bought me years ago.

However, I also still go to synagogue and observe Jewish holidays. I think if I had to choose between the two faiths I'd rather go Jewish, just because I believe in that faith more closely, however I've not converted and I'm not sure it's a good idea due to the nature of my job. If I was working in a secular school, or even in a less religious but still kind of religious school I'd feel better about being open with it, but this school still has nuns teaching (not full time and there's only 2 of them but still the nuns are very much here).

I was talking to my atheist brother (who had the same Catholic-Jewish situation as I did growing up) and his very devout Jewish girlfriend about it. The conversation started when she directly asked me what my beliefs were and I replied saying I relate more to the Jewish way of doing things but I have to pretend to be Catholic for school. She said that I was an asshole for lying about my faith, because I am, for all intents and purposes, Catholic, and I shouldn't be taking the whole thing so lightly, and basically said that I'm either in or out, I can't say that I relate more to Judaism when I'm a practicing Catholic. I replied that I have to keep up appearances for work but if work wasn't an issue then I'd convert, and she said that I was bullshitting. I told her that we can both just believe what we want and hung up. Brother is now demanding I apologise. I refuse to.

AITA?","NTA - I lied about my faith at work for years. When you're an atheist in Texas, it's just what you do. Ironically, it was my first job at a Christian bookstore that finally pushed me into atheism, but that's beside the point.

"AITA for getting frustrated with this customer and a group of kids?. I don’t think this is a huge deal, but I still feel a little guilty. So I work at a cafe at a family center and there’s a lot of kids, especially since it’s the winter break. There’s also a kids camp and parents are picking up their kids at the end of the day. Naturally, kids want to eat so parents would get a snack for them at the cafe.

Well, this one mom had like four kids and she was also picking up her friends’ kids so that’s like five more. It was suddenly a huge crowd in front of me. 

I want to point out that I am hard-of-hearing, so I struggle hearing in loud environments. All of the children were screaming orders at the same time at me. The mom just stood there. I guess she was expecting me to completely understand what they were saying. 

Eventually, I just said, “Timeout.” I didn’t yell. I just said it loud enough for everyone to shut up. Maybe I said it a little too harshly but I couldn’t do my job without everyone getting quiet. Then I looked at the mom and said, “Can you tell me what everyone wants?” And she was annoyed. She said, “They already told you.”

Ok, fine. So I asked all the kids to repeat their orders one at a time. And I don’t know why, but she was getting mad. She kept asking me if I was even listening. I tried to explain myself, but she wouldn’t have it. So she went to talk to my manager. 

My manager didn’t seem to understand what I did wrong so I guess I’m alright. I don’t think I was in the wrong, but I want to make sure I wasn’t a jackass.","NTA, retail is a landscape of hell and the demons are entitled parents with screeching, grubby crotch fruits.",0,0,0,0,1

my friend got a Green/Black starter deck and I got Red/Black. (the colours basically represent different ""factions"" or types of cards and they can be paired up or run as one colour)

my friend decided early on that he wanted to run a mono green deck and has done so for the better part of the two months we've been playing, completely disregarding all his black cards from his starter and finding green cards to add to his starter.

I decided to experiment with a mono black deck and since he wasn't using his black cards he offered to give them to me (there were 30 of them)

this last month I have done a lot of deck building and experimenting at the weekly tournaments (FNM) and my collection has grown from 60 to just over 1000 cards. it was also my birthday last Thursday and I have put a substantial amount of cash (for a beginner) down in order to obtain the stuff I have (cards from every colour and basically the freedom to do what I want.)

"WIBTA if I made my my employer pay me around one thousand dollars because of their own ignorance?. A little back story:

At the beginning of September my manager/ store owner showed me the schedule for the month of September which is unusual. Typically she sends an email to the staff about a week prior to the following month asking about availability, however this month she forgot or something. Anyway, on the first of September (A date I knew I was working because it was on the schedule for August) my manager told me that I was scheduled for the 13th. I told her I would have to check and see if I could work but wasn’t sure. 

The next day I email her saying that I had a previous engagement for that day so I would be unavailable to work. She tells me that I have to work because none of the other staff (one other girl) was also busy. After a lot of back and forth I told her in no uncertain terms that I was unavailable to work on the 13th. This morning I get an email from her saying that she has decided to terminate me and that I need to tell her where I want my final paycheck sent. 

Now where my decision comes. In my state (California) when an employer terminates an employee the employer has to give them their final check immediately after termination. In her email she stated that she is going to send me my check on the 15th after I asked if I could pick it up today. The labor law (which I don’t think that my employers are aware of) in California also states that for every day that my employer doesn’t have a check for me, they owe me one days wage (which for me is roughly 90 dollars a day and will add up to 1k by the time they say they’re going to pay me). It is also worth mentioning that my employer is around 65-70 years old, and although this thousand dollar penalty wouldn’t destroy them or cause them them to starve, the labor board filing suit against them may shut down their business.

In my experience with my employer, they have typically treated me with fairness and are usually reasonable (although there is the odd occurrence), however they were particularly nasty when we were talking through email the other night, and I know they have been less than fair with some of my co-workers who had to fight to get paid minimum wage. I know legally Im not the asshole but I feel like I might be morally.",NTA. Get your money. Something tells me that she fired you by email on purpose.

"WIBTA for giving my live-in MIL some ground rules?. MIL has been retired for 2.5 years. She sold her house in our city with plans to retire to a different city/town, so we offered to let her stay in our basement when she is here visiting. She offered to pay us, but we said no because we don’t need the money and we just want help with our 2 kids when she is here.

Anyway, things are becoming unbearable for us. She is here way more often than we expected and she is helping significantly less than we expected. There are also other issues that annoy us greatly. She constantly buys stuff for our kids. She buys way too much food and takes up our whole fridge. She is very wasteful with shopping, food, and packaging. This is on top of the standard MIL issues, which are mostly of the “bitch eating crackers” variety.

We have tried vocalizing some of these issues (ie: stop buying our kids things every day), but her behavior hasn’t improved. We do realize there are some communication issues on our end, and we want to give things another chance before we “kick her out” or tell her that she can’t stay with us as often as she has been.

I realize that rules are not in and of themselves ass-hole-ish - but we have gone about 6 months without them and I do not want to make her feel like a child and have the relationship break down further.

So last year on Christmas, my family got together with my aunt, who we aren’t super close to but see a couple of times a year. She’s been on a health kick for the last couple years, so she doesn’t usually cook with sugar, “regular” oils (she uses coconut oil for everything), gluten, etc. I told her as soon as we arrived that I have a fairly bad coconut allergy (trouble breathing, lips/face swelling & itching, nausea). Dinner went fine, and then during dessert, I asked if she had used any sort of coconut in any of the desserts so I could avoid them. She told me that the cake was fine, but after I ate maybe a third of a slice, she told me that she had forgotten that there was coconut oil in the cake, despite me double and triple checking that everything was safe.

Anyways, she came over last weekend and brought dessert, and when dinner was over and she set out the plate of cookies, I didn’t take any.

He allowed Oscar to stay without setting any guidelines and informed him that eventually we’re trying to buy a 5br house that needs tenants.

Issue is that Oscar can’t seem to keep any job and doesn’t contribute to any bills or groceries, but somehow always has money to buy weed and stays at home watching television or goes out to party. His lack of hygiene by refusing to shower or brush his teeth is also a factor. 

I understand he may have difficulties though, because He is an illegal immigrant and his family moved back to Mexico. 

My friend constantly complains but I don’t think he has the guts to tell him to go. 

I’ve tried my best to help him by loaning my second car, letting him work some odd jobs, we get along in a friendly way, but it seems he just falls back to his old habits and makes no real effort to change professionally.

My manager was working from home and knew we were just going out, so he changed it the moment we walked out.

This already made me a bit angry, because I was expected to finish a project and without access to my Google Drive I wasn't able to download the assets and designs. Also, I did not see any need to change the password for my email address as they could have just deleted or deactivated the inbox.

I wanted to download some images from slack before I left and luckily I added email forwarding beforehand (as otherwise I would not have been able to get my payslip).

My manager then went in the admin panel, reactivated the account, disabled two factor authentication on all platforms, changed my email address and then the password, reenabled two factor authentication and remained logged into my account for a few hours.

This made me absolutely fuming. I am fully aware that he is the owner of all things, but firstly why no heads-up? Secondly, why not just delete the accounts like a professional - instead of logging into everything and remaining logged in? Also, why do this when I'm still supposed to be working and I need the access. Anyway, I could not deal with it anymore and asked a colleague to message my manager to ask him to just delete the account instead of going through all my messages. I received no response and he remained visibly online. I was asked to continue working on the project whilst he messaged in the slack that I could keep on pretending to work as I still had access to the project. Thats where I had enough and walked out. I feel that whilst he may own it, I should have a little more privacy and respect than I had today. AITA?

"AITA for destroying a book that took me 5 years to make.. Back when I was serving in the military, I was based with an infantry unit that specialised in anti chemical warfare. We had a piece of equipment that was a lab on the back of a truck, and I was the person who seemed to be able to fix it the fastest, as all the manuals we had were a very complicated and not very good CD-ROM.

During my time there, I had a sergeant who took an instant dislike to me. Made my every day a waking nightmare, from berating me over small mistakes to actively making up lies about me so he could write me up about it.

"AITA For Bumping My Butt On My Nephew. Hold Tight I don't think it's as bad as it sounds ! But I'll let you be the judge.

&#x200B;

My Nephew is a 6 year old boy and I (26f) am very close with him and his mother (My Sister 25). I'll refer to my Nephew as Booger. My sister and I have co parented Booger since he was born and I have a very tight relationship with both of them and know them very well. 

Booger likes gross stuff. We make dirt pudding together, we go bug hunting, he calls me ""stupid slimy butt head"" and I call him ""fart mouth"" he thinks it's hilarious and so do I to be honest.

We had a family gathering yesterday with people we see maybe once every 2 years or so. All close relatives but definitely not what I would consider part of our immediate intimate family. Booger and I were playing together, he defaults to bugging me when he's bored. I picked him up by his feet and he was laughing hysterically yelling ""put me down big butt face"" to which I replied ""I'm gonna rub my gross butt on you."" I put Booger down and he runs and I chase him and butt bump him in his back and tell him he had ""gross butt germs"" now and run away while he chases me and tries to butt bump me. He's wheezing from laughing so hard the whole time. This is pretty typical stuff for us so I didn't think anything of it.

One of our uncles (we don't see often)  is sitting outside watching us and makes a weird comment about ""You better stop letting him touch your butt or he's gonna become a man sooner than he ought to"" (something along those lines) which prompted my aunt to scold me about it and make me feel like (an asshole). So I told Booger we had to calm down and stop playtime.

They've all left on a good note now, but I can't let it go. I feel like they turned what is an innocent play time into something weird and dirty.

"AITA for pitying a dog that was euthanized because they bit a coworker's brother?. Here's the skinny, people, I am a huge animal lover. I volunteer at the humane society weekly, take in stray cats and have fostered animals in the past. So no surprise, I'm a strong believer that there's no bad dog, just bad owners.

So yesterday at work my coworkers were discussing animals getting euthanized, the topic made me rather nausea. This one coworker, who doesn't like me in the slightest, starts telling the story of how his younger brother was hassling a dog a few years back. From what he mentioned, his brother was aggravating the pup by kicking and shoving him. Of course, the dog bites him, leading the kid to have a few stitches and dog to be euthanized. At the end of the story I shook my head and whispered to myself, 'poor, unfortunate pup'. 

I never intended for anyone to hear. I was a bit upset. Again being an animal lover I was angry his parents never taught him how to handle a dog and he treated it so poorly. I didn't say any of this though. The coworker did see me mouth the words and immediately called me out. He told me to go fuck myself in front of everyone. 

I explained to him I wasn't trying to offend him, I did feel bad for his brother and am happy he recovered, I just feel bad because the dog's aggression may have came from past trauma or a bad owner. I apologized, but again he told me to go fuck myself and walked away.

My coworkers agreed with me and understood I didn't mean to offend him. But I gotta ask my fellow Redditors, AITA?","NTA. The younger brother should NOT have been hassling the dog like that.

"AITA For Telling My ""Friend"" to Fuck Off?. I'm a girl.


There is this guy in my class(es) who is widely known to be a strange person. He stands too close to you, makes odd ""jokes"" about people's race and bodyshape, and is very unaware of social cues, often following people around long after their conversation has finished, and brings up inappropriate subjects (randomly talks about the Russian and Nazi politics during WW1 and WW2). Honestly he just makes me and others uncomfortable.


At the beginning of the year, he was assigned to sit near to me in 3 separate classes. I mostly ignored him, and occasionally cracked a smile at his non-racist jokes to be polite. Long story short, he began following me around. At first I was trying to be nice about the whole thing, but he just doesn't understand it. I told him a few days ago that he makes me uncomfortable and to please stop talking to me. He kind of laughed and changed the subject. I was so taken aback by his response that I just walked away. He still followed me, but didn't try to talk. Yesterday, after a few days of no change, I requested my seats should be moved away from him and I also tried telling him again to stop. He just kept talking to me. In frustration, I told him to fuck off and never talk to me again or I will talk to my counselor. I felt terrible about saying this to him, even if it was the only way it could get through to him. Today, he was absent at school, which has never happened before, so my guilt has grown exponentially. AITA?","NTA. Everyone, especially special needs kids if he is one, needs to learn social cues.

"AITA for clawing husband with my fingernails after he called me a bitch?. So my husband has had a cat for 6 years and we’ve just been together for 2. He loves this cat and sees it as his literal kid, which I don’t have any problem with cause I myself love the cat too. The only thing is he lets her sleep in our bedroom and she often want to get out very early in the morning so one of us will have to get up and open the door for her. Since it’s hard for me to get back to sleep and I don’t really like the idea of having her sleep with us at night (she sometimes knocks shit over when no one’s watching), my husband gets up and let’s her out about 95% of the times. 

Well early this morning, I’d heard the car fucking around in the room, doing all kind of shit she does when she wants out for like an hour and my husband still wouldn’t get up so I told him to let the cat out. No answer. I told him again when he reached out to unplug the fan, still no answer; and again when he flipped over to my side and whispered something thing about cuddling, he still wouldn’t get up so I eventually had to open the door for the cat and consequently unable to fall back asleep. 

Pissed and tired I went out to the living room to work on my computer. He came out after like 30 mins and asked the usual “what’s wrong” and I told him about what happened. He said he was sleeping and didn’t hear me at all. I called bullshit because he reached to turn of the fan and did say something when he flip over. We argued back and forth, things escalated to the point when he ended up calling me a bitch for the first time after 2 years together.  I got up to leave and he held me down so I grabbed his arm and went full force on it with my sharp fingernails. I could tell it hurt and now it’s kinda swollen now. 

Am I the asshole? Or is he? In my defense, the last time we fought he did threaten to hit me for the first time (if you don’t stop I’ll hit you) and it’d been stuck with me since so when he held me down so hard to day, it kinda came back and with him calling me a bitch just seconds earlier, I kinda snapped.

I came into the picture at some point and became fast friends with D. At the time, C, was a 17 year old girl. D is a 21 year old man. Within a couple weeks of meeting D, he had made mention that he was planning on meeting with C and having sex with her. I specifically remember this part because he emphasized that her parents weren't going to be there and that he was a virgin so he ""might as well get it over with"". Once he told me she was 17, I told him that his thought process was gross and that she was a 17 year old girl and couldn't technically legally consent. D made a point to tell me her birthday was ""in a couple weeks"" and therefore, who cared?

D constantly complained that C was clingy. He complained about how she ""coerced"" him into ""domming"" her in front of her online boyfriend. About two weeks of this, I made mention how the entire conversation around her was uncomfortable, how she did seem clingy and how him indulging her seemed wildly inappropriate. Eventually, he agreed to tell C that he didn't want to talk to her anymore.

Fast forward, D and I have a falling out.

About two months later, C brings up how she had very recently had a birthday which I found odd given what D had said. I mentioned this. C freaks out and I tell C everything that D had said about her. I thought she knew.

In reality, D had never told C anything but went around telling others he had.

C confronts D. D, who is no longer in my life, goes to his friends and claims I'm trying to ""witch hunt"" him. I hadn't. I'd simply told C about the things D had said - I thought she already knew and when I found out she didn't, I told her everything. It seemed prudent since D was trying to get back into C's life. D tells C that if she tries to press charges, it would be ""unnecessary"" and the court would ""throw it out"" and ""nothing would happen"". C is understandably upset.

Because I told C, one of D's friends (who WAS my friend) confronts me saying I'm ""ruining D's life"". I let them know that I'd only told C. L suddenly ""can't trust"" me. I said my piece to L and decided I was done with L.

My other neighbours (not the one this story is about) have pet birds so that's another reason to make sure my cats can't ever get out.

A couple months ago my neighbour buzzed me to ask if he could cross through my patio to his, as he had locked himself out. I said no for the following reasons:

1.- It would have meant opening a section of the fence, and I don't trust my ability to rebuild it safely for my cats.

2.- Our landlord, who lives next door, has copies of all our keys

3.- The cost of a locksmith would be approx the same as the cost for me rebuilding the fence

4.- He was drunk as a skunk and I don't want strange drunk people inside my apartment

He kept buzzing through the day I guess to ask again, but I ignored him.

So what happened is in his drunken state he decided to ask strangers from the street for help forcing his front door open and in the process they destroyed the lock, so when he called an actual locksmith he was told the entire lock needed to be replaced... and instead of using the locksmith services I guess he asked strangers again and ended up with a giant hole in his front door. From the noises I could hear from my bedroom I think everyone involved was very drunk.

So he ended up having to pay for an entire new door.

Now him and his boyfriend hate me and I've heard them refer to me as ""the wh*re who refused to help J."" but from my point of view I did nothing wrong since he could just have called our landlord, or a locksmith, instead of me having to tear down a section of my fence potentially endangering my cats' health. I feel a bit like an asshole for not answering while he was buzzing the rest of the day, but honestly I was not in the mood for arguing with a drunk guy.

I could also have offered to let him jump the fence but I was afraid he would break something.

So, AITA?",NTA. I wouldn’t have let in a drunk neighbour that I barely knew into my home either. And I would definitely not have destroyed my fence for said drunk neighbour. He should have called the landlord. That’s what they do.,0,0,0,0,1

"AITA for not wanting to be my sister's surrogate after she was my caregiver?. I'm 25 and recently engaged, my sister is 29 and has been married for 3 years. She and her husband have been trying to have a baby forever, longer than they've been married, and it's just not happening even after several rounds of IVF. They've dumped a ton of money into trying to have a baby and are starting to look at other options. Unfortunately, they think I'm one of those options.

My sister asked if I would be a surrogate for her and I absolutely do not want to. I'm not planning to have any kids of my own so I'm not exactly interested in being pregnant. I know it would be an amazing gift for her, but it seems like it would be a nine month nightmare for me. My fiance has also expressed that he is not comfortable with it. Also for as much as I don't want to be pregnant in general, I ten-times don't want to be pregnant or recently post-partum at my wedding, especially with a baby that isn't even mine.

I love my sister, but to be honest the whole thing seems downright creepy (for me. if other women want to be surrogates for their siblings I don't think there's anything wrong with that.)

Here's the sticky part. My sister was my caregiver for a little over a year after I developed severe mental health issues when I was 18-19. I had very strong agoraphobia and did not leave our apartment once during that time, and I was clinically depressed. My sister did all of my food shopping and meal prep, talked me off the ledge several times, and was basically my emotional crutch. After years of intense therapy I am now at a point where I am functional, happy most days, and in a healthy relationship. I regret the way I treated my sister during this time and that I made her my caregiver. And there's a little voice in the back of my telling me that if I give her a baby then I will make up for it. And she has implied the same in our few conversations about the matter. But I just really, really don't want to be pregnant.","NTA

Holy hell NTA. Maybe you relied a little too much on your sister, but she could physically walk away. She was not taking care of you 24/7. It didn’t ruin her wedding.

"AITA for having my husband go to therapy and sex addicts anonymous?. We've been married for 7 months and I'm 7 and a half months pregnant with our first baby.I am considered high risk pregnancy however a week ago I got news that the issue that was putting me at high risk has resolved itself ...we were under doctors orders to avoid sex (at my 24 week appointment  and I'm 33 weeks now) I don't want to resume sex until I have a for sure confirmation that it would be safe which I would get at next weeks appointment.
We did have sex last week and I was severely uncomfortable after because I was feeling a lot of pressure down under...for that reason I am still concerned about it idk if that's normal.
Now before we got docters orders we were having sex about twice a week and I found out he had spent 600 dollars on webcam girl sites for private shows/pictures in 2 weeks.We talked it out and came up with the agreement that he was stressed out about new baby ,living with his family, job security and other emotional distress.I suggested therapy so he could have a third party to work on everything and have a healthier mentality before our baby is born. He agreed.
Before I go any further I want to say I don't mind him watching porn... the only thing I have a problem with is him spending money on it when we have things we need to get for our baby.
I have since caught him twice paying for videos and pictures online and seen from his browser history on his phone that he's on webcam sites and porn sites when he's in public every day. Last night I found a conversation on his messenger between him and his ex where he told her that he is having to jerk off in a public restroom because I don't want to have sex....that really hurt me.I brought it up to him today and he just wants to write it off as stress but I think he really needs help with this.
I tried to shorten this down and keep all information needed.Am I wrong about him needing sex addicts anonymous or overreacting about the entire thing?

I go into my room and my brother is blasting music at full volume and I tell him to please use headphones so I can concentrate. We share a room unfortunatetly.

"AITA for not agreeing with my GF?. My girlfriend (30F) and I (26M)  have been together for almost a year now, in the beginning of our relationship we’ve fought over the lack of time spent with one another. Believe it or not it was me that would always express the fact that I don’t see her much. 

We never really had a honeymoon stage, from the start it was always her forming our time around her friends. A few times she’d call our day short to see her friends and one time even canceled on me an hour prior to see her friends.

Eventually after many arguments I stopped voicing myself and just stayed content with the few hours I’d see her. 

So just last week she had plans to see her friends and I was sick but encouraged her to go see them; however we met up early that day (her idea) to grab some food before she left to her friends. In that midst we got into an argument over something so ridiculous but around 10 we dropped it and she stated it was too late to go so she stayed the night. 

Now flash forward, she tells me that her friends are mad at her and aren’t speaking to her because she didn’t go out with them and she states that since it’s my fault she’s beginning to be resentful towards me and tells me I should fix this. 

So I start messaging her friends that same night, telling them I’m sorry and it’s my fault and I ask for us all to go out and grab food and squash this. 

Today my girlfriend states that her friends still haven’t spoken to her and she’s angry/ resentful towards me and can’t be happy. I then told her, maybe her friends need to mature up because them ignoring her for over a week shows just how much they value the friendship. 

My girlfriend flipped out on me and left to her place and I feel like an asshole. So long story short, Am I the asshole?

"AITA for not feeling bad that my father was in a car accident?. So today I received a call from my mom that my father had been in a car accident. My mom and father have been divorced since I was about 6 or 7, currently 26. My mom remarried when I was 8, then we moved to a different state. My father also moved to a different state so I would only see him every other summer, sometimes during Christmas break back when I was in school. So suffice to say he's been in my life but not as a major role model.

So bringing this up to speed recently I attended my cousin's wedding this passed summer, which was also the same weekend as my father's 50th birthday. Pretty much our entire family showed up back in our home state, minus my father. Which he gave a very poor excuse for not showing up and the whole family was disappointed, even his own mother was furious since it's his sister's daughter. We all worked had to plan a surprise for him only to find out 48 hrs before the wedding he wouldn't be there. Bare in mind the wedding date was announced a full year before actually happening, plenty of time to prep for this trip.

He is now trying to invite my sister and I to his wedding to a woman who he only met within the last 8 months. My sister wants no part in this due to the fact that the past 2 years worth of birthdays/Christmas for my niece and nephew, they didn't receive anything from our father, not even a phone call. She called him out on this after finding out he didn't go for the wedding, which she couldn't make it just due to financial issues, and his excuse was ""a phone works both ways"", so she's expected to call him  on their birthday to talk to him? It has been 3 years since he last called me, I called him out on this and the wedding/his own birthday. He promised we would talk more, still nothing, not even a text.

To further the issue why I don't feel as bad is he is marrying the same woman who, while my sister was calling him out for not keeping contact with his own grandchildren, decided to take the phone from our father and tell her that if she was our mother she would have slapped my sister on the mouth for talking to our father like that. She is only 5 years older than my sister, and has not even met either of us yet. He seems more concerned with her children than his own flesh and blood. This is why I won't be attending his wedding.

I still care about him, he is my father and I wouldn't want to see him hurt, but I just don't feel as bad as I think I should for him getting in a car accident.

"AITA for refusing to let my newly immigrant family members stay at my house?. Basically the title says it all. 

My parents are old/retired and I currently pay the mortgage on the house we all live in. 

My father made the decision to invite my newly immigrant family members to stay with us until they can establish their selves in our country. This will take about 6months - 1year as each family member will be coming at separate times. They’re coming from a third world country and speak absolutely no English. There’s 6 family members (2 parents, 4kids) and all of them are over 18.

Now normally I would perfectly alright with this. It’s just - my father made the decision without consulting me or anyone else in the house except my younger brother. And, I don’t think my father understands the responsibility it takes to help establish a family coming from a completely different culture/country. It’s almost like having more kids but their adults. 

You have to teach them English, drive them everywhere, cook for them, teach them the culture, and pay for their expenses until they can pay for them themselves. 

My parents were once in the same situation and depended on the kindness of other people to help establish them. My father is arguing that “he’s been in the same situation so he knows how hard it is.” So, I do partly feel bad but - I’m not embarrassed to say that I don’t want to deal with this responsibility. I want to be able to come home after a long day and not have to worry about other people in the house. And, I already know the responsibility will fall on me because my parents are old and can’t do much. 

Nonetheless, I got into a huge argument with my father and my other family members got involved. There saying I’m selfish for refusing to allow them to stay at our house. And, that I’m incredibly privileged because I was born in my country and my house is big enough to fit more people inside. All my family members (cousins, uncles, aunts) think I’m being selfish but no one else is willing to invite them into their homes.

We will call groomsmen B...B and his fiancé are now engaged and super happy for them. They mention getting married in March and want to do a destination wedding, we say a couple months before our wedding is close but we will definitely make it work. Fast forward 4 months and we get an email invitation to their destination wedding in Mexico LESS THAN 2 weeks before our wedding date.... we are stunned.

My fiancé breaks the news to B who insists he “forgot” our date and didn’t realize it was so close together.  Now it’s been about a year since we decided that we can’t go to the wedding which is now 3 months away from now and for a favour to the groomsmen I was tasked with getting my fiancé to renew his passport for his bachelor party. Of course I’m happy to help make that a great weekend for my fiancé but is a surprise. getting him to renew his passport took like 4 months and felt like pulling teeth. He kept saying he “had no plans to travel so why would I?” It took me all but ruining the surprise to finally convince him to just get his passport.

I told her that I’ve devoted my entire life to taking care of my siblings & that I just won’t have time to monitor everything she’ll be saying/doing and the ppl that will be around, to ensure they don’t say anything that will set her off. My mother said she’d just go to the parties and keep an eye on her or I could just not invite her, as long as she gets to walk down the isle then she doesn’t care. I told her I feel thats even meaner,  we’d post about it online and she’d know we did these things without her. I told my mom that I didn’t mind giving her a smaller job in the wedding so that mom could watch her. My mom got so furious at the idea & told me that, if I didn’t make her a brides maid and let her help make decisions, my mom wouldn’t be at the wedding and I could count on that. I said, you’d miss my wedding over this? She replied, I know your sister is hard to deal with & you’d have to watch her, but you can’t take this important moment away from her in her life. It’s cruel and wrong and I won’t be apart of such a horrible thing. Everyone at the wedding will know what you did, the family won’t like you and will be so disappointed in the person you turned out to be and your friends will think you’re a terrible selfish person who made her mental sister cry. I told her I just can’t watch her and care for her during a wedding. She ignored me 
  I know that if I did give my sister the ability to be a brides maid and I rejected an idea she had, she’d tell my mom & she would guilt me into doing the idea, or I’d keep telling her no and another argument would happen. My whole life we’ve been unallowed to deny my sister anything and if we did my mom would get angry. She’d tell us we were terrible ppl for doing it and that she deserves better. My mother has her thinking she’s entitled to everything in life, even now if I try to correct her for anything my mom will get angry & make me feel bad. I love my sister dearly, and I’ve always been kind to her and talked her down from her angry spells or when she’d create ideas in her head I’d try to explain they weren’t real. AITAH?

"AITA for getting annoyed at my boyfriend after seeing something he post on reddit a year ago?. I’ve (21F) been dating my Boyfriend (22M) for almost a year now, when we got together it was really important we had safe sex when we decided to do it. I asked if he’d been STI checked and he said not only was he recently tested and hadn’t been with anyone since but had always used a condom with everyone he had slept with. A couple months into our relationship we were playing a drinking game and we had to list how many sex partners we’d had, it was then that he told me he had actually had sex a couple weeks before we met (which was after his STI test). I was upset and felt like he’d breached my trust completely and jeopardized my health. He said he’d used a condom, I talked to him about it and we decided to move on. 

Just today he said we should follow each other on reddit, I thought it was a great idea. I went on his profile (not intentionally trying to find anything just having a look cause he’s a super funny guy I thought it would be fun) and I saw a post about him having sex with this girl and her telling him she wasn’t on the pill after they’d had sex and how it freaked him out because he didn’t use any protection. Not only was this frustrating cause of safe sex (since he’s never been tested for certain STIs only the common ones and I have an immune disorder so if I catch an STI it’s incredibly risky and dangerous). Anyway he’s saying that he never lied about this stuff even though he has a history of lying to me. I’m incredibly frustrated and trying to move on. I’ve been tested regularly (I have to be with my immune disorder) and know I have no diseases but I still feel like he put me in a risky position and doesn’t understand how serious this is.

"AITA for not wanting a 3some?. So my boyfriend and I have been together for over a year, both in our ealy 20s.
We're both very open about what we want and what we've done in the past, such as the fact I've had a few 3somes (ffm) which is what he wants with me. 
Normally I'd say yes and be excited, but I'm not particularly keen on doing this with him as I really do love him and I'm scared of the impact this may have on our relationship. I'm worried that after being with another woman he won't want me anymore, that I won't be ""enough"". 
He's never done anything to make me feel insecure, he's actually my first partner that's put an effort into telling me how much he loves me and attractive he finds me. I know if I tell him the reason why I don't want to he'll reassure me and tell me he'll always love me and my body and that he'll never leave me and that I'm enough.

"AITA for wanting to confront my sister about blatant lies against our father?. My half sister runs a YouTube channel, where she speaks about her lifestyle, and informs the masses about it. She uploaded a video a while ago about a point in her life where her, her siblings, and her mother, and step father were all homeless, and living in a garage with almost nothing in it.

She went on for minutes with a story about how they had nowhere to go, and no money for Christmas that year. It was truly heart wrenching, and I couldn't believe my parents allowed that to happen after first watching. So the next day, I questioned by parents about the video, and and they explained what happened.

Her family was not homeless, they were staying in a friends garage while their house were undergoing renovations. 


She stayed with our father and my mother, and I on the weekend. She had clothes, food, and a place to stay EVERY single weekend. 
She also did not mention our father and my mother once in the entire video.

Not only did a bunch of strangers see that video, but close family and friends. 


TL:DR: My sister runs a YouTube channel, and made a video about her experience with ""homelessness.""

"AITA for asking my 19 yr old daughter to talk me through her nasty texts to me before I let her borrow my car?. Recently my son flipped out on me and cussed me out and yelled because I was cleaning up some of his things on the porch (mentally he cannot abide change). He reached out to his big sister for support (she lives remotely), and she got so wound up about it, that she texted me. She took his side, and sent me nasty texts, calling me manipulative, that I lie, that I should take my title as mother and jump in the lake. 

Her texts were really hurtful, but also two-faced. She was nice and polite when I paid $1,000 the week before to have her seen by a medical specialist. She was grateful, but suddenly I am the complete bad guy in her books. 

I didn’t understand how and why she jumped to these conclusions about me, and told her that text is not the way to do this. Then she asked to borrow my 2nd car that she used a lot before she moved away to college. When she returns she typically uses it. So, she asked me to use it again this week to travel to a place two hours away for a very important job interview.

I said yes, sure, but you’re going to have to discuss your texts with me, because I can’t interpret what you mean by just reading them. It’s confusing to me - why is she polite to me, yet terribly nasty when it comes to text? She refuses to clarify anything. She’s calling it emotional blackmail and that she should get use of my car without having to explain herself to me. 

I gave her the analogy that your friends wouldn’t let you borrow their car if you said nasty things about them. She didn’t understand that I had boundaries too. 

My daughter did reveal last month that she blames me for a trauma she suffered that I never knew about. And she has told me that she won’t tell me about the trauma until she’s ready to. I respect that. But I think her recent opinion about me in her text is wrapped up with this trauma. She flat out refuses to explain her texts and now I am a bad and unsupportive mother again (who will pay her another $250 next month, and every month to help her out with college expenses). She has always been secretive, and while I thought she was a quiet self contained kid, she was cutting and drinking and hiding all her emotions from me. 

So, AITA for “making her talk” before she can use my car?

"AITA for moving me and my sister’s table after some lady tried to sit with us in a public space?. me (22f) and my younger sister (17f) spent our whole day shopping and were pretty tired, so we stopped at this cute indoor plaza to chill. the place wasn’t that crowded so we got nice seats by the windows, and then my sister went to go get us coffees. a little bit after she left, this well dressed white lady who looked about 45 comes up to me holding a chair asking to sit right next to where i was sitting. i was super taken aback because like i said, the place wasn’t crowded and there were several open seats and tables. i politely told her “someone is sitting with me” and gestured to my sister’s things and all of our shopping bags, which basically took up the entire table. instead of taking the hint, she goes “i don’t mind; i’m not going to be using the table”. to avoid trouble i just said “okay”.... lol big mistake. 

like she said, she didn’t use or even face the table, she kept her purse in her lap and was facing me. we were both just silently on our phones but i was low key panicking that i did the wrong thing, lol. it just seemed so weird to me that our of all the open places to sit, she chose to come to an occupied table. i texted my sister and she was annoyed that i let the lady sit there. i didn’t want to be rude and ask the lady to leave after she was seated, so i got up and moved me and my sister’s chairs and the table with all our stuff on it. not far mind you, just a few feet so there was some distance and it didn’t seem like she was sitting with us. i wanted me and my sister to have our privacy when she got back. as i was moving the table the lady kept scoffing and rolling her eyes, which i ignored. she then muttered “what do you think you’re doing?” which i also ignored, thinking that would be the end of it. but no. after i sat down she stood up and said loudly enough for everyone to hear “why the hell did you move the table? you said i could sit there.” at this point people nearby were staring. i reminded her that she herself had said she didn’t need the table, and told her there was plenty of other seating available, to which she responded that this was a public space and she could sit wherever she wanted. i got pissed and told her no, you actually can’t just infringe on people’s personal space like that, let alone when there’s tons of empty seats. she huffed and called me a stuck up bitch.... and then she LEFT. as in she literally marched through the doors and walked out instead of finding a different place to sit. tbh this was probably the weirdest and most hostile interaction with a stranger i’ve ever had.

i do understand that it is a public space, and i feel kinda bad bc she was just sitting there on her phone. the issue is that she was sitting way too close for comfort, lol. also what she said to me was totally uncalled for. my sister thinks i am justified. so reddit, AITA for moving the table and chairs that we were using in a public place?","NTA - PLEASE READ THIS:

"AITA for leaving my gf alone after she kicked me out. The title might be quite misleading but hear me out. 

Me(21) and my gf(21) are in a live in relationship. Last night we had a fight because she was jealous that I went to my female friend's birthday party and I was the only male there. This really pissed me off because she had a lot of male friends and I never had a problem with that. I straight up told her to stop being insecure and it's really pathetic that she doesn't trust me even after an year of our relationship. She got really pissed and asked me to go sleep on the couch and threw a pillow and blanket out the door. I didn't want to argue with her anymore as I started having a headache so I closed the door and left. 

I was really angry with that had just happened so I took my wallet and my Nintendo Switch and decided to check in at a nearby motel. It had been a long time since I played Mario so I stayed up all night playing Mario and also watched a few movies on Netflix. After sunrise I decided to go back home and apologise. So, I bought some flowers and breakfast and drove home at 6 AM. 

When my girlfriend open the door she was fuming and it was pretty obvious by looking into her eyes that she had cried before. I somehow managed to calm her down and asked her what happened. She was still fuming and asked me where I went. I told her what I did and she called me an asshole, cunt, idiot and what not. 

So apparently, after I left she started hearing noises from our windows and doors. She said it was like someone was knocking on the door really slowly and then they started knocking on the windows and she heard the kitchen window creaking and almost shit herself. I asked her if she came out looking for me. She said she was too scared and didn't move a bit the whole night. Also, her phone was charging near the window so she didn't go there too. 

I didn't know what to say so I just said ""I'm sorry"" and she's still fuming. 

Also, my gf has no history of paranoia or anxiety. If that was the case, I'd never have left. 

Edit: We live on the fourth floor. So she was talking about a ghost, not a burglar. She's kinda scared of ghosts. But I'm the type who can't even listen to horror movie music. I'd shit my pants the moment I heard the first knock.

"AITA 23M For walking home from my 21F girlfriends apartment.. On Saturday night my girlfriend picked me up from my house to hang out and have dinner. I decided to stay the night and go home in the morning. Well It was a wonderful day to go out and take a walk. I even offered to take her dogs for a walk earlier in the morning. Which she said no and gave no reason for. After sitting around waiting for her to be ready to take me home. I thought it would be a good idea to just walk. So I went into her room she was about to shower. Told her I was leaving and I would see her later. She asked if someone was picking me up, I said no I was going to walk. She starts saying I wont be much longer just a shower and I can take you. I said its cool Ill just walk I want to anyways. She then starts making up excuses as to why I shouldn't walk. Its to far, no one walks home, offers to take me home then. I told her it is not that far of a walk, I like to walk and don't worry about. She gets pissed off and just jumps in the shower without saying anything after that. I went for my walk.

Some info about the walk. It was at 11:00am on a Sunday morning in one of the more wealthy parts of town. According to google maps it is 4miles, one street all the way down crosses 2 intersections. No big deal I have walked further then this before.

I was having a wonderful walk get about half way there when she calls yelling and screaming at me for walking home. Telling me I better get in the car when she pulls up. I start thinking to myself what is this nonsense. It is just walk but whatever I will get in the car. When I get in the car she starts yelling and screaming telling me to never do that again and that I shouldn't have gone on the walk. I say it was just a walk it is not that far anyways. I was really enjoying it. She doesn't seem to care and start exaggerating on the distance of the walk. I don't really say much kinda in shock that she is yelling at me like I am a child. We get to the house I get out of the car she slams on her gas and drives off. I then receive a text saying never do that in my presence again. I respond with I will do whatever I want. It was just a walk. This breaks off into a whole different argument that I will spare the details of. Unless wanted.  So Am I? I am very confused on this still.

"AITA for intentionally deflating a child's ball?. Look, before you click the title and type YTA, let me state my case.

I'm an Northern Irish guy living and working with my girlfriend in England and while we have a nice house and a dog, the neighbours kids are terrorising us and getting their parents to threaten us when we don't bow to their every whim.

Over the past year, the kids in the estate kick a ball against our high wooden fence nearly everyday, the noise it makes is annoying but we can live with it. However, sometimes the children kick the ball over the fence and come knock on our door to get the ball back, again it doesn't bother us too much.

Recently however, the kids have been kicking the ball over numerous times in the day and I work hard 9-5 so surely it's understandable that sometimes I couldn't care less about the ball, especially when the kids are rude to me and swearing at me when I give it back to them. So one day after retrieving the ball 5 seperate times and witnessing one kid attempt to climb my fence and get into my garden, I issue an ultimatum, if the ball lands in my garden again then I'm keeping it til the following day and then they can get it back.

The kids went and told their parents that we took their ball and won't give it back so here comes two parents knocking on our door yelling at us to give their ball back. Me and my gf protest saying they are damaging our fence, being rude to us and we insist that we are being reasonable qbut the parents keep saying the same thing ""give them their ball back now"", except more and more forcefully each time.

So what am I meant to do? Live my life as the defacto ball boy of the estate, eternally returning the balls back to their selfish, demanding owners under coercion by their parents?

Now I should preface this next bit by saying that I'm aware that my next actions could make me an asshole and I would normally agree, however, I would argue that I'm not THE asshole in this situation.

After having some kids dad come to my door and square up to me, I had enough, clearly noone bar us are interested in having a reasonable conversation about playing with a ball in the middle of a busy road (when there are 2 perfectly good parks 1 min down the street) or respecting other people's space so when the ball came over the fence last, I grabbed my sharpest kitchen knife and sank it into the football so to emulate a nail puncture. I step on the ball and squeeze a load of air out with my foot and then throw it back over the fence, making a much harder thud when it hits the ground 

Now I know this is petty and immature but I've had enough of acting as a surrogate parent to these whinging little shits and I feel someone should at least teach them that actions have consequences, especially if their own parents couldn't GAF.



UPDATE: just got home from work and the neighbourhood kids asked if i can go get their ball again, I said I'll have a look. Then I just told them it's not there.

"AITA My Friend Ended our Friendship Because I Canceled my Gym Subscription Last Night. Hi, just to give a bit of a background I was born and raised in a hot climate and I have never seen or been around snow until last year when I moved to Erie, PA. (Really cold place during winter to those who dont know)

I am 23, she is 10 years older than me.

The reason why I ended my gym subscription is because last year Erie had about 5 feet of snow, and in the news it was expected that we might have similar weather to last year's. So, as someone who really hates snow and cold weather and not used to it at all, I decided that it might be best to cancel it. Not only that, often times when it's really cold outside and I leave the gym sweating I get sick the next morning, i would have a running nose and my body starts to heat up. And I do have weights at home, so I can workout home during the winter and join the gym again once the weather gets better. Those were my reasons. 

I told this to my friend who I have known for over 3 years now, as we were casually chatting. She responded to that by saying ""lmao, are you serious? The world doesn't stop because its cold, they work around it. Not going to the gym because it's cold seems just as an excuse to not go. It is an immature way of handling it. It says alot about your work ethic when you just stop because its cold"" the quotation isn't 100% accurate as she had blocked me so I dont have access to the chat anymore, but those were the most memorable sentences she said. For me I honestly thought i was being made fun of, as I just I am just a kid who quits because it's too cold. I mean if you wanna over simplify it and only focus on the cold then sure, but for me it was more than just cold. I tried explaining to her why I prefer not to go, she then proceeded to say ""yeah this just how your generation is too lazy/quit whenever they get the chance"", we used to play an MMO game before and I hated farming in that game cause it was tedious and very tine consuming. So she mentioned that as well by saying ""yeah even in games you always hated farming. That's just how your generation is, you are immature"". So if you haven't guessed already, this wasn't the first time she had said these words to me, it's actually quite common. And I do get annoyed when she says those things because I feel like she's undermining me as if I wouldn't know better just because she was born 10 years earlier. I then told her, I am getting really irritated by what you are saying, it is my decision not go to the gym and I am in a position in where I am happy on how my body looks and feels, taking a break from it for a few months is not a big deal. She said ""yeah it's just not a valid excuse to quit the gym, I'm saying this cause I know you can do better"". I said ""well you really sound like you're mocking me"". She said ""you dont know how to take constructive criticism, and you should make new friends that dont challenge anything you say and agree with you about everything"". I then said ""I may not be able to take criticism well, but your delivery of constructive criticism wasn't good at all, it really sounded like you're mocking and undermining me and being made fun"". She said ""how am I mocking, you're giving my texts emotions, you know what I'm done being your friend you are an egotistical bastard.."". I said ""alright, no problem it was fun while it lasted, best of luck have a good one"", she said ""cheers"" then proceeded to block me. 

Now that wasn't the first time she keeps on saying I'm immature and all that, and I told her i dont need to be reminded every single day that im immature even if I am. But she kept on doing it.

I genuinely dont think I am in the wrong here but if I am please elaborate. If I am the asshole I will go and apologize to her even she doesn't want to be friends, I just dont like having bad blood with people i know. Either way, thank you for taking the time to read this, I dont have friends anymore to talk to about this so that's why im posting it here. Thank you!",That girl is such an asshole you are by no means an asshole. Ignore the shit out of her.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for agreeing with my girlfriend about losing some attraction to her due to weight gain. Bit long so skip to the tl:dr if you want.

So me (22) and my gf (21) were chilling in the living room watching TV and she initiated sex - recently I had lost attraction to her because of her weight gain so I just wasn't in the mood for it at that moment.

The loss of attraction was because she wouldn't make an honest effort to work on it and ignored my advice (only given when she asked). It was a constant cycle of:

**Her**: ""I need to lose weight""

**Me**: ""Why don't you try this?"" (said in a nice sincere way)

**Her**: ""Ok"" and then she wouldn't try, and she would gain more - doing obvious things she know's or I have said isn't helpful (again, I would mention these things only when she asked and in a gentle way) like constant snacking.

At the start, she wasn't like this and it's been a noticeable difference: maybe 40 lbs gained. She constantly mentioned it to the point where I started influencing the way I saw her: at first I wasn't bothered, then I started to notice and be bothered more and more. Even so, I always said honest positive comments where I could and never negative ones.

So back to when we were chilling watching TV, she then says ""I know I don't look how I used to so I get it if the attraction isn't the same or you've lost some to me"" to which I replied: ""Yeah I guess things have changed, but that's not why though I'm just not in the mood, and regardless I want you to know I still love you and will always support you, you're still beautiful"". In my head I was like, she's opening up and being honest and we can work through it.

Nope, the next few days she literally shut down and started blaming me for making her feel bad, saying she can't believe I said that to her, and how sick she felt that I would say that. How she feels horrible now looking at herself and thinks I've told everyone I know that she's fat. How it's mean as she's trying her best. I apologized again and reiterated how much I love her and I'm still attracted just like she said it's changed a bit. This happened months ago and she still brings it up and says it was really hurtful I said that and still affects her.

I believe that honesty is important in a relationship and I didn't want to lie about something that I knew we both realized. Am I the asshole in this situation?

**tl:dr:** My girlfriend brought up that she knows the attraction between us has changed because she's put on weight, I agreed with her in a sincere way still saying I loved her and she's still beautiful and now she's blaming me for saying that and saying it's hurt her really bad and she feels awful now looking at herself despite me always supporting her, never mentioning her weight and trying my best to help her lose weight when she asked me for advice (which she ignored). AITA?","NTA  
  
Her insecurities are showing and she's taking it out on you. You owed her honesty, and as long as it was given in a loving/caring way then you were correct for being honest.  
  
Body dismorphia in its many forms can be a bitch. But if she hates the weight she can do something about it, however it seems from what you wrote that she probably has deeper self-worth related issues that probably contributed to the weight gain.

"WIBTA if I change the rules for friends spending the night?. Hello, this is my first Reddit post and I'd like some advice please. 

I have 3 great children.  17 Male, 16 Male, and 14 Daughter.  I don't claim to be the prefect parent and neither does my wife, but we definitely think we are raising them to be good kids.  

I am not stupid either.  I know kids have sex, but we have always had what I thought was a fair policy.  Both sons are allowed to have friends spend the night if they're boys, and my daughter can have her female friends spend the night.  We allow opposite sex children to be over but they can't be in the bedroom with the doors closed.  

Well my middle son (Noah) has found a loophole.  Turns out he's gay.  We have suspected for awhile, but my wife recently confirmed it.  Now I am totally okay with him being gay, that's not the issue.  He has a ""friend"" (Tyler) who is a pretty nice kid.  Well he spent the night last weekend and we did what we always do and put the blowup mattress in my sons room.  

Breakfast came the next morning and my wife went to go get the boys to eat.  She went upstairs to get them and knocked on the door, no answer.  So she opened it slowly and low and behold they're both sleeping in Noah's bed spooning each other.  The sheets on the blowup never touched.  So she closed the door and went up 30 minutes later and knocked louder.  This time after hearing some running around Noah opens the door with Tyler in the blowup.  

So we have both decided we want Noah to tell us when he's ready and not to call him out.  We have made it clear we'd be okay with anything.  In the meantime though, that creates a problem.  Noah is having his boyfriend (or I assume) spend the night and hooking up with him.  

So in order to be fair against all 3 kids, Tyler shouldn't be spending the night.  So my oldest son has two twin beds in his room, and my daughter has pullout second mattress in her room.  So my wife's idea is that we ""break"" the blowup mattress.  We can set them both up the family room which is downstairs, a couch for each of them.   So this wouldn't change the rules for the other two as they already have extra room in their rooms, but Noah wouldn't have the room in his full (although he proved us wrong on that), and he would have to sleep downstairs with no more blowup.  

I admit I go so back and forth on this one.  On one hand, it's not fair to the other two kids, but on the other hand he did find a loophole.  

My other concern is I don't know how Tyler's parents feel about homosexuality.  I am afraid their could be backlash if they find out he's been sleeping in the bed with my son.  

So AITA here?",NTA I see that you're trying to be fair. You could implement a living room sleep over policy. Any sleep over I had growing up was spent camped out on the living room floor,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA Nicotine Kisses. 

My girlfriend (an ex smoker) and I moved into our first house together, bit of a stressful move but we’re together and happy. She’s now started smoking again, she went to kiss me this morning and I pulled away, she’d just finished a cigarette and it made me feel nauseous.  She’s angry with me telling me that she’ll never kiss me again and what happened has stressed her and will make her smoke more.
I love our kisses and intimacy but this makes me feel sick.

As a smoker she should respect your boundaries and accept that it’s a nasty smell/taste to non-smokers.

"AITA For getting mad at my boyfriend for complimenting me?. Okay so, a bit of a baity title I understand. For some context, I have been struggling with an eating disorder for a while and I’m very pleased to say I’m now on the road to recovery I think. The problem is it’s a very fragile recovery and I tend to relapse into disordery behaviours quite a lot. One of the things that causes me to go off the rails is any comment regarding my body at all. It’s kind of irrational but it seems my brain will find any way to twist a comment about my body into “You’re a huge fat whale!” For example if someone says to me something like “wow you’ve lost weight!” In a positive sense I will twist that and rationalise it by thinking that no one would say that to someone who isn’t fat therefore, I am fat. I know how irrational and it seems really petty (it is), but these things can really spiral and send me into an episode of self hate and starving/purging. I explained this to my boyfriend and asked him if it would be okay if he didn’t make any comments regarding my body, even positive ones. He was a little confused but agreed. Later we were lying on the couch and he said something like “I love the shape of your body, I love how it curves” and I’ll admit I did overreact and completely freaked out at him I just felt a pit in my stomach when he said that, especially with the comment about curves,  and I started going on an emotional rant. (I know, unnecessary). It devolved into an argument and told me I need to grow up and I can’t expect him not to compliment my body when he’s my boyfriend. He said “in the real world” people will be making comments about my body all the time and I need to learn how to deal with it and not expect him to coddle me. 
I’ll admit, he does kind of have a point, but I’m not sure if I’m being unreasonable. Comments like that, for lack of a better word, trigger me and I just want recovery to go as smoothly as possible until I can heal and be okay with it.  
So am I the asshole?","NTA

"AITA for quitting work a few days before Thanksgiving?. I’ve been working at a restaurant as a hostess for eleven months. The restaurant was a very unhealthy work environment, primarily caused by the General Manager, who took out a lot of her anger on the hosts. For some reason, I got the most of the blow, as did my family.

The manager, who I’ll call Amanda, began to cut down my shifts after I worked there for about six months, all the way down to one shift a week. She threatened to fire me on the basis of customer complaints (that she refused to let me see), and would have gone through with it if I hadn’t gotten the proprietor involved.

I’m sure you’ve heard of the romaine lettuce recall by now if you live in the United States. I was on shift last Friday when we received the recall, and immediately remembered that the salad my mom had ordered about twenty minutes prior was made with romaine. I called her to tell her to see if it had romaine on it, because there was a recall and she shouldn’t eat it. I went to Amanda with my concerns, who’d already switched us over to a salad mix that lacked romaine. When she heard that I’d told my mom about the recall, she lashed OUT. Snapping at me that there was no reason for my mother to know, it wasn’t even on the news yet. The salad is fine and Amanda wasn’t going to talk to her, I’d tell my mom myself, and not to waste her time.

I went back to the phone fighting back tears, relaying the message. My mom spoke to the proprietor then, who was not aware that it was my mother on the phone. He advised her to throw it away and offered to make a new one.

I was already upset because of the situation, so when the manager told me to go home early (as monetary punishment), I was infuriated. I made the choice to quit right then and there.

The thing is, though... I didn’t. I got a lot of anxiety about the whole thing, wondering if she could affect my future jobs or if she’d harass me. I ended up putting it off until Tuesday, when I finally spoke to the the proprietor and told him I was quitting effective immediately, which meant that I wouldn’t be working Thanksgiving as previously planned... for a bit of context, we were fully booked for weeks. He didn’t sound surprised when I dropped the bomb; I’d informed him of everything that had happened on Friday.

It’s been nagging at me, so I figured I’d turn this to Reddit. Am I the asshole?",NTA. Knowingly letting people eat recalled food is unprofessional and unnecessarily lazy. You aren’t wrong to refuse to work somewhere that would do something like that.,0,0,0,0,1
"WIBTA for refusing to meet with him to accept his apology?. So I'm on a college sports team and without going into too many details (check post history if you're curious) I'm gay and had one teammate (we'll call him Toby) who subtly but persistently bullied me for this. I tried to talk to Toby about his behavior. Kept it pretty civil. Toby got mad at me for even suggesting that he might have concerning views and he refused to apologize.

Anyway. Toby transferred schools at the end of last year. I was thrilled, but of course it was too good to be true because now he's coming back in a few months. I told my captain, ""this is what happened with Toby. I do not think that I can stand being on the team with him any longer. If he returns, I may have to leave the team."" My captain responded positively and was clearly not happy with Toby's behavior. He told me that he would talk with Toby to determine his intentions but that if push came to shove the team needed me more than it needed Toby (he is not good at our sport and brought a lot of unnecessary angst to the team.) My captain had a conversation with Toby and told me ""Toby has gone through a lot of personal growth and wants to apologize.""  
 

The timing is shady af. If Toby had realized the error of his ways earlier, he knew how to contact me. I'm fairly sure that he's only reaching out because he's figured out that his position on the team and in the eyes of our captain is compromised. I don't really want to meet with him. I never want to see him again. I was in a really bad state mental health-wise because of him and I've just gotten to a place where I feel pretty good again. Maybe I sound naive, but it was the first real homophobia I experienced and it really messed me up. 

WIBTA if I told my captain, ""I don't want to meet with him. I don't want his apology.""? I like my sport but not enough to have to play nice with someone like Toby.","NTA

"AITA if I ask the garage to reimburse me?. Recently my car has had some troubles with the clutch (the pedal itself, not the actual clutch). I took it down to a fancy German car garage - I drive a small Audi, and while it’s not particularly expensive, it is my baby and I was willing to pay more to have my car fixed properly. They tell me it’s a pin, and the part should cost me £15, and per hour they are £120 and it’ll take around 1.5 hours so they quote me at £190 something pounds. The per hour fee is expensive, but I’m in an expensive city and in an expensive garage, so I don’t mind, assuming the work will be done perfectly. 

Cut to go picking up my car after 3 days, got the nasty surprise that they didn’t include tax when quoting me so it ended up being around £240 or so. Whatever, I just want this whole ordeal to be over. It’s a Friday, and I drive myself home (about 2 miles) then to the supermarket (round trip of a mile) and then pick up a friend from the station (half a mile) and the clutch goes again. I’m fuming. My car has done all of 5 miles and it’s broke again. I took it to a bit of a dad garage when I was at home, and they “temporarily” fixed it on New Year’s Day using a bit of plastic. That’s lasted around 700 miles on my car and I paid £15. 

I take it back to the garage and the receptionist tells me to speak to the mechanic. He explains he was trying to make it as cheap as possible for me by only replacing one part, but now the entire pedal-box has to be switched over which I don’t think is going to be cheap. My dad says the whole thing is a bit dodgy and I’m thinking of taking it to another garage depending on the price they quote me tomorrow anyways, but I want to be reimbursed/refunded. It was a huge waste of my time, I lost my car for 3 days. I had to Uber back and forth from the garage (it was freezing and there’s no close station), and the price they charged me was extortion. It may not have been their fault that my car is broken, but I asked them to fix my car and they didn’t. Does it make me the arsehole to want my money back, even though they technically provided what I needed? 

TL;DR garage charged me money for fixing the car, car was fixed for 2 days and broke again, do I deserve my money back or is it just one of those things. ",Nta. You took your car to be repaired.

"AITA for meeting my friends although I knew it would make my boyfriend feel bad?. So my boyfriend and I are long distance, we have spent 1.5 months at each others places during summer break. He left one day and my friends invited me to the game night the same day he left so I decided to go, I haven’t met them in 2 months. He has never been fond of my friends because they are all boys, I cannot really make any friends who are girls easily as my school is a game development high school and my hobby is kung fu. There are obviously a few girls but I haven’t clicked with anyone in my class but I did with a few at kung fu but the same amount of boys there aswell. 

So he took it really bad when I said where I was going, it was 7pm-12pm I was out and I got home at 1 am. I felt really bad since he disliked it a lot but at the same time I feel like I should be allowed to hang out with my guy friends as he hangs out with his. The “worst” thing I did was hugging the host hi and bye, it was a 1-2 second hug so definitely nothing romantic or anything bad imo. 

The whole night was basically just card games and smash, some drank beer but I didn’t because I can understand he at least doesn’t like when I drink without him as I can do pretty weird stuff, I have like a 0 tolerance. 

I just feel like I cannot change who I am and I just like things that are male dominated at this age, it is changing but today it just is how it is. At school I have to hang out with some people and if I don’t fit in with any of the girls and really fit with some boys I don’t see the problem.

"AITA for not feeling guilty for giving someone herpes?`. So I (22f) slept with someone about a year ago. They gave me genital herpes. I later learnt that they knew they had herpes but didn't think it was important to tell their partners. 

So fast forward to a few weeks ago. I met a guy (25m) and we start talking, we flirt over text a bit and we decide to meet up. Before anything happens I tell him I have herpes and give him something information on it, I also give him a couple of websites so he can do his own research if he wants to. I'm on anti-virals, always use protection and never have sex curing/immediately after an outbreak. 

As you can guess, he catches herpes. This was always a risk, I told him this more than once, I even gave him a few days between telling him and us hooking up so he could research/let it sink in. I also told him explicitly that it was cool if he didn't want to have sex anymore.

Anyway, he calls me up and tells me, well he shouts it at me. I understand he's upset but he's saying really awful things about me, blaming me for what happened. I try and calm him down 'cause I know they actual worst thing about herpes is when you first have it and you suddenly feel very dirty.

He calls me up multiple times to shout at me and call me names. At one point he asks me how is he going to tell his family (why???). After he calls me a diseased whore I tell him that I'm going to block his number if he doesn't stop and he says I should take responsibility for what I've done. I hang up, send him some forums for people with herpes so he can have people to talk to and block him.

I spoke to a friend (she doesn't know him, didn't give her any details about him) and she says I should be more sympathetic 'cause it was kind of my fault?

I feel like I did everything in my power to keep him informed and that ultimately it was his choice, the only other thing I can really do is not have sex with anyone unless they know their status which like 90% of people don't.

"WIBTA if I tell my obsessed friend (24f) that I don’t care my bf (25m) has tinder?. For background, I’m in a kind of open relationship with my bf,(we’ll call him Max) where we can’t/won’t date other people but we can hook up, talk to, flirt, everything BUT starting a relationship or get emotionally involved. My relationship works for us and I’m really happy with it. 
The issue started when my bf started talking with a girl from tinder and he eventually met up with her, she never asked if he had a gf or was dating someone else, bf never told her because he assumed she didn’t care, (turns out she did) , she eventually met a “friend” of mine, we’ll call her Mary, and tinder girl asked Mary if she knew Max because they wen’t to the same uni, Mary told tinder girl Max has a gf (me) and tinder girl acted all hurt, mind you they only met once and he never said they would date (I saw the texts, he showed me). Tinder girl blocked him and all was good. 
Mary went all psycho with me though, texted me at 3 am to tell me all about what tinder girl told her, (Mary knows and has always known how my relationship works), I told her it was fine and I already knew, well she kept on telling me how my bf was gonna get an STD, and that tinder girl felt “so lucky” to have met her because “she saved her”, I was trying to be nice so I kept on explaining to Mary, but all she wanted was to tell me that I’m stupid, that my bf was fat (?) (he’s not, he’s honestly not), that my bf wasn’t tinder girl’s type, and that he was gonna get someone pregnant, this was an hour long rant. She texted me at least 2 times after that to tell me the exact same things, and to keep on bashing on my relationship and my bf. 
I understand she might feel like he lied to tinder girl and she didn’t like that I didn’t get angry with him about it (?) 
also maybe she’s trying to just be a good friend by telling me my bf has tinder

TLDR; friend kept on texting me about my bf’s recent date, even when I told her I already knew and didn’t care","NTA - You wouldn't be an asshole for telling your friend to mind her own business, your friend isn't an asshole either though I'm afraid. From what I can see your bf is borderline asshole and let me explain why.

He agreed to meet up with someone on Tinder and then later claimed it wasn't a date. Let's be honest here, meeting up with someone on Tinder is date. Not the same thing as dating someone, but it is a date.

He also failed to tell her that he was already in a relationship. People on Tinder quite rightly have an expectation that the person they are talking to is single. If they're not, they expect that to be made clear because otherwise you're just being misleading. I'm not surprised she blocked him, she thought she was meeting up with a single guy and turns out he's in a happy relationship. The fact it's an open relationship is irrelevant - she did not sign up for that when she met up with him. You say he assumed she wouldn't care. That's the stupidest thing I have read in a while. It's pretty important information to have for a dating app. It appears he went there with the expectation that it would be a hook up, she went there potentially looking for more. Even if it was just a hook up she was looking for, she had no idea that (from her perspective) she was helping this guy cheat on his gf. 

But back to your friend. She may have known about the nature of your relationship, but she seems to not have known about your bf's Tinder adventures. She didn't need to blow up about it but given how your bf essentially didn't tell this girl about his relationship status I can see why she was so upset. 

I would suggest instead of continuing to message via text, meet with your friend and have a face to face conversation about it.",0,0,0,0,1

I'm talking about the type that keeps used toilet paper, rotten food, broken items, ect. My great grandma has 7 other kids besides my Nana, one of which that lives in the same house as my great grandma. My nana lives on the same property but in her own house, and my great grandma and her first born son live in the same home. Lets call him Jr. Jr feeds my GG's hording issue. My nana will throw away rotten or broken items and he will dig it out of the trash. Nana has even caught C going through her own trash for god knows what. Jr is critical of my nana, always yelling at her for cleaning or criticizing her for how she is ""not doing things correctly"" even though he does nothing for my GG besides take her to the store so she can buy him groceries. As a child I did not understand all of this but now that I am an adult I can see all the turmoil and craziness. It breaks my heart to think that my Nana is trying all that she can to take care of her mother but is basically getting emotionally abused by her own brother. The fact that Jr is pretty much causing elder abuse on my GG by the environment he causes makes me want to get social services involved. Because he will literally make it to where she cannot move through her own house safely without falling due to all the trash and he will not clean her or her clothes and leave her covered in feces till my nana gets there to clean her up. My nana checks on her 4 or more times a day. My nana tries hard, but bottom line my GG is basically suffering from elder abuse by Jr. 

Here is where I think I might be TA. If I called it would tear my family apart, I think my nana would resent me but I know she is tired of all these years of abuse. Her siblings and their children would hate me for doing this but I don't care about that, but I do care about them being mean to my nana over my own actions. Should I just talk to my nana and see what nana wants to do? I am scared she will say no to calling someone but I do not want to let the elder abuse keep on.

"AITA for not apologizing to my mom?. For context, my parents are divorced and I am in my early 20s and in college.  

Yesterday I had to say goodbye to my 14 year old dog whom I loved dearly.  She was my dog at my dad’s house and the first dog I ever trained and took care of myself.  After saying my final goodbyes to her I was very upset and was crying.  My mom knew my dog was being put to sleep and that I had to say goodbye to her.  I went to my moms house since I was on her side of town and I haven’t been able to visit recently due to being busy with work and school.  As soon as my mom saw that I was crying she looked at me and said, “Oh stop it.” in the most dismissive tone.  I simply replied, “Fuck you.” and turned around and walked out of her bedroom.  I stayed at her house for 3 hours after that to see my little sisters and my mother never even bothered to leave her room to say anything to me.  

She had my sister tell me she wanted me to go talk to her in her room upstairs and I said, no and that I was not talking to her until she came to apologize to me for being rude.  I left without saying anything else to my mom and went back to my apartment.

Today my mom called me and told me that I needed to apologize to her for being so rude yesterday.  I said, I wouldn’t because she was so dismissive of my feelings and unsupportive of me first.  She responded by saying that I didn’t support her when her dad (my grandpa) passed away 3 years ago.  I told her I wasn’t going to argue about this with her and ended our phone call.

Within an hour, she texted me and told me that all I do is take advantage of her and treat her like shit.  I replied and said, “You know that’s not true.”.

I don’t think I treat my mom like shit, I call her at least 3 times a week and try to meet with her on her lunch break at least once a month.  I still partially rely on her financially while I am in college and I am certain this is why she claims i’m “taking advantage” of her.

"AITA for getting mad at my s/o for posting my kinks online without telling me?. So my gf (21f) and I (23m) live together and have for about 2 years now. She has a LOT more friends on Fb than me (which isn't a big deal I just don't use Fb much). She's friends with a sex worker on Fb who has a ton of friends and a lot of them comment on her statuses and a lot of them lurk on her profile. 
Anyways, this morning we woke up and we were laying in bed just talking and she casually says ""oh SW (sex worker) has this fetish too!"" And at first I was just surprised and I went with it and asked how she knew they had this fetish. So my gf says ""well I commented on SW's status and I talked about how you had the same fetish and-"".

I cut her off right there and just said wtf??? Like very very few people know about my fetish because in my opinion, it's still a weird fetish (maybe not weird but it's super uncommon). So I told her I didn't like the fact that she just put my business out there in public for everyone to see and I went further and said I was super upset that she didn't even ask me before posting the comment YESTERDAY. By the time she showed me the comments, a lot of people had liked her comment, and a lot of people had responded to it and stuff like that.

Anyways I did get super upset and kinda yelled at her that it was bullshit that she did that and put my business out there and didn't bother to ask or tell me about it until AFTER the fact and she didn't seem to see anything wrong with it???
When I asked her to delete the comments, she also had a kind of snarky attitude and suggested I was overreacting to the situation. So I asked how would she feel if I went and posted about some of her weird fetishes and let everyone know about her kinks all publicly like she did?? Of course she said it would piss her off.

"AITA for keeping to myself that my niece is probably from another father?. All names changed for privacy. Not a native speaker, sorry for mistakes.

I'm 30F. My half-sister Lisa is 50F. We have the same father. She has three kids, 20F, 18M, 16F, all supposedly with her ex-husband, Nick.

2005, Lisa confided in me that she had a ""secret boyfriend"" Peter, and told me stuff about him. I distinctly remember her telling me that Peter had FOUR children. I THINK I remember her adding ""well, three, really"" and when I asked, bewildered, how he could have ""three OR four children"" she replied, hesitatingly, ""well, one child lives with another woman"".

Anyway, I kept out of the situation overall because I was told by a relative for certain that Nick knew about Peter, so I left their mess up to them to figure out. (Later on, I heard Nick stayed with Lisa all those years despite of knowing because he hoped she'd give up her affair eventually and come back to him.)

2013, Lisa owned up to her affair, left her husband, married Peter and moved in with him and her 3 kids.

After that, there was a lot of trouble in the family because she had to confess to an affair lasting (so she claims) since 2004. Anna was born 2003.

Her and I haven't been so close in the last few years, so when I visited a few years ago, I asked her ""doesn't Peter have four children?"" I didn't think of anything when asking, it's just that I didn't know Peter and his family background that well. My sister said in a clear and bewildered voice ""no, he just has three"". I said, being genuine, that I must have mixed it up with another situation then or remembered incorrectly. Only weeks later, what this situation might have meant really sunk in.

Her youngest daughter, my (half)-niece, Anna, looks VERY much like Peter, in my subjective opinion.

Lisa can be difficult, IMO, and if things don't go her way, she can flow off her handle. She has dealt with the way her children reacted to her cheating very badly, dismisses them a lot, and claims ""everything's fine now and our family life is wonderful, everyone's happy"" when in fact, all three children are hurting and feel deeply betrayed, my oldest niece told me.

So my guess is, that if Anna has suspicions she is Peter's bio daughter, she wouldn't dare bring it up in this atmosphere.

I feel like this is on Lisa, also I don't know for certain. I'm questioning my memory but you wouldn't just remember stuff like that incorrectly, would you? 

On the other hand, it's a HUGE assumption to make.

Lisa has also distanced herself from me a lot in the last years, there may be other reasons for that (my family is pretty dysfunctional overall as you could guess from this shitfest lol), but my suspicion is also that she wants to keep me away from her family because I might cause her trouble for exposing this situation.

"AITA For not showing up to a shift scheduled outside of my availability?. Backstory 
I work as a server at a half arcade half sports bar Restaurant on the weekends. (Thurs-Sun)
I attend school during the week (Mon-Wed) so I’ve had it blacked out of My availability on the online scheduling program since my first day 

This week was spring break for the Local schools in the area so they scheduled more servers than usual throughout the week to counter. However, I was not on spring break as my college didn’t follow the same schedule as the county. 

So I get a call Monday morning asking where I am. When I tell them I’m at school my boss starts to get angry saying it was spring break and that these dates were blacked out for taking time off. I tried explaining about how my school had Spring break last week and I wasn’t aware that my schedule had changed. He then seemed to not believe me when I said I was at school and said he’s treating today like a last second call out when I told him I can’t leave school for my shift.

I live in a house with 5 others (strangers at first), and yes it's crammed.

One of my roommates was visiting home for 2 months this summer, and we all kinda mentioned that he'd still have to pay rent, because of the contract, but he wasn't willing. He wasn't going to be working for the 2 months and he absolutely refused to pay. The other 4 of us didn't like that, because it meant our rent got more expensive, so we collectively decided that if he didn't pay those 2 months rent, we'd put all his stuff in the garage and turn his room into our own gaming room. We were paying for the room after all. We told him this, about 2 weeks before he left, but I think he thought it was joke.

(Leaving me at home alone for weeks with hardly any food, ignoring all of my calls and texts and when she did answer all she said is I'm on my way home, and wasting all of her money on her addiction so we got evicted from our place)

She eventually started using this guy as a sugar daddy bc he's a millionaire, but he got mad and tried to sue her for something unrelated.

People being at the house that weren't there and blowing money). This got to the point to where everyone was yelling, cussing, and breaking stuff all the time.

"WIBTA if I don't like the furniture my bf chose for my birthday gift?. I live with my boyfriend and our two dogs that weigh 90 lbs and 135 lbs.  They are family and, as with all other family members, they are allowed on the furniture.  

Our living room is small and has two walls that couches or chairs could go on.  To maximize seating and floor space, we had a sectional.  Before the sectional we had a couch and an oversized chair, but we hated the wasted space in the corners of the room since it made the useable floor space so much smaller.  The sectional was a perfect fit - room for an end table on one side, and the ottoman could be moved to the end of the chaise side to open up floor space.  It was microfiber, so dog hair vacuumed easily and all pillow covers were machine washable.

Several months ago, my bf said he wanted a recliner.  Our living room is not big enough for a recliner.  I asked if he planned to get rid of the sectional and put his recliner in the middle of the living room because it has to be so far off the wall to recline there'd be no room for other furniture.

After pointing out the limited space for a recliner, I told him I do NOT like recliners that look like recliners.  I hate them.  If it looks like a normal chair *and* it reclines, great - but I don't like fluffy, poofy recliners

The recliner he was looking at was leather.  I told him that my parents have very expensive leather furniture, and their dogs that weigh less that 20 lbs have destroyed parts of it.  There is no way it'll hold up to our giant pups, and I won't tell them they can't be on the furniture.

Now, on to the AITA part. . . 

Several days ago, I walked in to my living room to find brand new furniture.  Now, I'm sure you're thinking, ""It's a recliner,"" and you're right. . . But there's more.  In addition to the recliner is a loveseat that *also* reclines!  It is all leather, and it all looks like recliners.  The loveseat has a center console, so it's basically just two individual recliners.  My living room looks so small because the loveseat is 24 inches off the wall.  When you sit in the recliner, you can't see the loveseat because it's entirely behind you.

My first thought was I'm not happy, my second thought was that I'm sad that my dogs won't get to be on the furniture.  My third thought was oh well, I'm not paying for it. . . But that all changed when he said, ""Happy Birthday!""

Happy Birthday?  Happy Birthday??  I told you I didn't want ONE leather recliner, so you bought me THREE???  Bullshit.  This is not for me.  *You* wanted a leather recliner.  You bought furniture for *yourself*!  

Since the furniture arrived, I haven't said anything about it.  I only pointed out that it will get ruined quickly because, even though we can keep the dogs off of it while we are home, they roam free while we are gone.

What I want to say is, Do you listen to anything I say?  Ever?  What about the bench I said I really wanted when you asked what I wanted for my birthday?  Where am so supposed to lay down without a couch?  Am I supposed to yell at the dogs every time they try to do something they've always done?  What are we going to do with the wasted 24 sq ft behind the loveseat?  Why did we go from comfortably seating 7 adults to seating 3 adults *and* lose floor space??

I love my boyfriend, and I know he at least had me in mind when selecting the color.  I know he wants me to be thrilled with it and I know he is excited about it.  I think he knows I don't love it because he said, ""I tried.""  It makes me very sad that I don't like something he went to the effort of picking out and purchasing, but I don't understand how he managed to get all three things that I said I did not want in one set.

I am not an ungrateful bitch.  Had he not gotten me anything for my birthday, I probably wouldn't have noticed.  And even if I did realize he didn't get me anything, I wouldn't care.  I just don't like that he is masquerading something he purchased for himself as something he purchased for me.  ","Absolutely not the asshole. You told him you didn't like the style and he got it any way. That isn't a gift for you, its for himself. There's nothing wrong with him having say over what goes into the house, but pretending like its for you when its something HE wants seems manipulative. 

Please note: I may be biased on this topic. My mother gives ""gifts"" like this all the time. Shoes too small so she can ""take them off my hands."" Throwing away my belongings so she can give me a different bedspread. Selfish changes disguised as gifts are a red flag to me. 

You need to have a conversation with him, but it can be done in a measured way. Ask him why he thought of you for the gift. Express your concern over losing cuddle space with your dogs. Express gratitude over his hard work and tell him you don't want his hard work to result in destroyed furniture.

Today I was coming out of the shower at the gym (barefoot) and I slipped and  fell on my ass. I was in pain for like 5 minutes but was ok after. The floor is some kind of untreated polished concrete kinda deal. It's really slippy when it gets wet. So anyway, I mentioned that to the owner and she got upset about me mentioning it. Now, I wasn't looking for trouble, and I made sure there weren't any other clients around. I said it as to avoid other people slipping and falling and prevent problems for the gym. She said that in 30 years nobody had fallen in the changing room (mind you, they renovated it recently, so those floors are new). And that I should've worn sandals or flip flops or something.   


Anywway. I just finished with ""look, I'm not looking for trouble, I'm just mentioning because it would be safer that way. I'm young, I fall I stand up and keep walking. But there's a lot of older folk at this gym and if that happened to them they could get really hurt.""   


This obviously didn't happen in the US (I'm guessing I could actually sue the gym if it was). I'm not looking for legal advice, nor to press charges or anything. And I'm not gonna stop going to that gym, it is really fucking cheap for what they offer.","NTA. They aren't looking out for the safety of their clients.

"AITA when I position my car in a way that I don’t feel high pressured from a panhandler?. I feel guilty every time I pass one, but I’ve been misguided before by one and I was by definition homeless at the time but still gave a good amount of money to me to a guy begging for money. I won’t get into what happened, but ever since, I stopped giving out money to people I don’t know. 

I’m an easy person to pressure so I tend to do anything to help the pressure that I am feeling, like positioning my car in a way that they can’t see my face and I can’t see theirs.

"AITA for kicking my crazy mom out of my life?. Since I was a small child my mother has emotionally attacked me in almost every way she could. She decided that my younger sister was her favorite and treated me like a 2nd class child. When we live together we don't get along well because I am very practical and she is very over dramatic and does not want conflict resolution. 

We usually text each other a ton. She lives with my sister and has repeatedly told me my sister will not allow me to visit her. Every once in a while my sister will ask me to pick something up from the bigger town that I live in and she gives me the money for it. It occurred to me that if she won't allow me at her house, I should not be doing these favors because she is just using me. 

So I spoke with my mother and asked her not to be upset with me if I decided to tell my sister no because I dont wanna be an asshole but I also don't want to be used. My mother said she didn't want to be in the middle of it but to do whatever my gut was telling me. End of story right? Nope. 

So my sister texts me a little later. My mom went to her crying because I am so mean and she can't handle it. My sister wanted to know why she was being brought into something. So I explained my reasoning to her. Well it turns out she had never told my mother I wasn't allowed at her house. This was an invention of my mothers mind which she honestly believed. So my sister and I fixed our end. 

So I tried to talk to my mother again the next day. She said I had upset her so much the day before and she was mad at me. I told her that I was mad that she keeps inventing issues between me and my sister and that if she got herself so worked up after a simple conversation that its her problem and not mine. I told her to deal with her issues and stop taking stuff out on me. I also said I no longer wanted to talk to her until she could take responsibility for her actions. 

So its been several weeks. I miss talking to her a lot because we tell each other random stuff that happens. But Im almost 40 and I am tired of being in the middle of these head games. So am I the asshole for not speaking to her anymore?",NTA - Sounds like you need to replace the hole that your mother left with more communication with your sister.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA - for not wanting to attend my friends wedding?. Going to keep this short and sweet, I have a friend who Iv’e been friends with for 7 years now. Said friend has a girlfriend (now fiancé) who I’ve been good acquaintances with over the years, but she herself is not really my actual friend.

My friend has been officially dating this girl and for most of their relationship, has been cheating on her with various females. I used to bring this up from time to time but other male friends of ours basically tell me to mind my business and call me sensitive for caring about it so I eventually just stopped bringing it up. Now, what he does with these other girls doesn’t affect our friendship in the slightest.

Well, to my knowledge he stopped this behavior about a year ago when they got engaged, and the wedding is being planned for a few months from now. I was invited but declined, when he asked me why I don’t want to come, I told him that even though I’m not particularly religious, I do find marriage to be a pretty serious thing and don’t think its right for him to be marrying this girl when she doesn’t know he’s been cheating on her for years and only relatively recently stopped. I said I’m not going to go up to the wedding and cause a scene or anything but I don’t feel comfortable being apart of that. I told him the only way I’d come is if she knew and left it at that. I still consider him a friend but I literally just feel morally wrong about the shit. Again, I’m not the most morally straight guy so alot of my friends are calling me a hypocrite and its soured a few relationships already, but honestly? This is a hill I’m ready to die on. I personally feel like what he’s doing is tantamount to tricking someone into marriage based on a false image he’s presented (I didn’t say all this to him)

So am I the Asshole here? ","NTA 

But PLEASE tell his fiancé that he was cheating. Do it anonymously, do whatever, but please tell her. Like you said before, you don’t think it’s right for him to trick her into something as serious as marriage, and she should know his previous actions. He also might have risked her sexual health, which puts her at risk for STD’s she might not know about for years. He’s deluded her into thinking he’s someone she can trust, which is not the case. 

I’m pretty sure that anyone (including myself) would want to know this information before committing to marriage. She will find out, but the later it is the more devastating it will be. Heartbreak now will save the thousands of dollars in wedding planning, mortgages, potential kids and divorce proceedings down the line. ",0,0,0,0,1
"AITAH for going scorched earth on a friend over a text message?. Honestly, the title is misleading but that is technically what the situation boils down too. 

For some back story, my friend is a recovering heroin addict. She’s been struggling with addiction her entire adult life. I’ve always shown my unconditional love, sometimes to the point of enabling though I work really hard to tow that line. She’s lived with my husband, son and I on and off throughout the years.

I’ve always been there when she called. I’ve given money and endless amounts of time. I’ve put in so much effort. Picking her up late nights, driving 45 plus minutes when she needed me. 

When she went off to get sober, she and her bf made the decision to leave and head across the states. It was abrupt, she didn’t tell me until the night they were leaving. I gave her the money to make the trip safely. 

When she came home the first time she passed out in our driveway and was so far gone I thought she had OD. I helped her leave home again.

If anyone has ever loved an addict maybe you understand, but when they call or text and seem erratic or upset it leaves you super uneasy, especially when they are in recovery. 

That leads us up to now. She has been sober again and made the decision to come home for good. We spent one night together and had been texting every day after that. In the middle of the week she suddenly sends me an erratic string of texts about being “SO FUCKING UPSET” and “screwed completely out of money”. I texted her back on my break and on and off days after, attempted calling and all that. We had made plans for the weekend and the weekend goes by and I still haven’t gotten a response. I reached out to her sister finally, because I was worried, and was told she is fine. 

I look on Facebook and she’s been posting, acting normal. I finally text her again and tell her basically “Wtf, I’m hurt? You could have let me know you’re okay?” And I don’t get a response for another few days, when I do she tells me I’m being bitchy and that her phone was broke. She had no way to text anyone, but we talk on FB messenger.... and she was on FB. I don’t bother hashing that out though. I just explain that I’m hurt because she could have just told me she was fine but busy, I wouldn’t have cared and I just wanted to know she was safe and okay. Instead of replying to my message she starts posting stuff about “People change up on you when you start doing stuff for yourself for once.” And the like, which really hurts because most of our relationship has been seriously one sided.

I decide my last message said enough and I block her on everything.

One of the new girls she’s been hanging out with reached out to me and told me I was a bitch, the reason addicts have trouble getting sober, and all other kind of things because I blocked her and haven’t been returning her phone calls. 

I’m really just hurt and confused and can’t help feeling like TAH because I’m upset and ghosted a friend of over 10 years because of a text message. Am I the asshole here?","It sounds like you have been enabling her for years and not doing much in the way of toeing the line.

"AITA for wanting more from my partner. Obligatory apology for any mistakes since I'm on mobile + this is a throwaway. 

Tl;dr: my dad has died less than two weeks ago. I'm (diagnosed) depressed and cannot easily deal with sudden changes in scheduling and long nights alone. Boyfriend suddenly decides to go out because he feels bad from me feeling bad. 

So, my dad has unfortunately passed away less than two weeks ago. It was all quite sudden and very stressful in regards of planning for everyone in my family.  My partner has been trying his best to help me out as well as he can (just like with my diagnosed mental disorders), despite his lack of experience. I often acknowledge that I admire this and that I am very thankful. 

After a few days, I already notice that I start to feel a shift in our functions in our relationship. Instead of him caring for me, I care for him. Whenever something annoys him, or he gets hungry-angry, I try to solve this. This makes me ignore all my negative feelings automatically. I don't underatand why. I have told him about this, but I can't remember the outcome of this.  

This situation has carried on, but a lot less noticeable as he has gone back to work after our trip for the burial. However, for me it has reached a confusing breaking point today with him going out with his buds. I obviously do want him to have a life apart from our relationship. I find this very important and having noticed his struggles with my situation have encouraged this as well. However, I have made it clear in the past that I greatly appreciate him telling me in advance, e.g. not one day in advance, as I cannot easily plan something with my friends due to busy schedules; and that I appreciate him trying to not plan anything late into the night due to my difficulties with making it through the night, even more since my dad's passing. I do realise that this is not always possible, but asked to maybe not pile it on too much, which he then continued to do by saying this would be the case the next two saturday nights as well (which are also hard for me to plan around as my friends like to go out this night and I have a panicattack at the idea of going out but that's my problem).  Also, would like to say that this would be a lot less difficult for me not so, for me, soon after my dad's passing. 

I know that it is difficult for my boyfriend as well. And again, I really want him to have a social life as well, which is why I'm wondering whether I'm being a psychotic asshole of a girlfriend and demanding too much.

"AITA if I tell a guy I don't really know his girlfriend is actively cheating on him. For context, the girl in question (I'll call her Anna) lives with my girlfriend and constantly has other men round. All the people who live in the house disprove strongly, but don't want to make things uncomfortable by telling her boyfriend what she's doing. At current we know for a fact that she's slept with at least 2 guys in the last few weeks, repeatedly. There's been nights where Anna has stayed at somebody else's and nobody knows for sure what happened on those occasions.

I don't want to do anything to make my girlfriend uncomfortable, but I can't imagine how betrayed I'd feel if I was in the shoes of Anna's boyfriend and people didn't tell me as soon as possible. They don't have an open relationship and on the few times I've spoken to the guy he's said how much he hates living long distance and that trusting Anna is the only reason he doesn't struggle too much.

So essentially AITA if I tell him? I could make a fake facebook account to give him a heads up anonymously and then I'd be more than happy to leave it alone. The other girls won't tell him anytime soon but really hope he finds out and Anna won't ever tell him I don't think.

"WIBTA if I exclude my moms from my daughter’s kindergarten graduation next year?. Leaving a lot out of because of word count.

I’ve done a TON of personal growth recently,  I feel like a completely different person. I’ve finally gotten my depression under control, and things are going really well for me.

I think it’s time to cut my mom off. She was never there for me. She had me and one of my brothers every other weekend, but we spent many over nights at a babysitters. She dropped me off at grandmas in a diff. state when I was 10. She gave me two pieces of gum: one for the plane ride over, and one for back in a few months. I saved that 2nd piece of gum in my powerpuff girls backpack. After a year, I ate that fucking gum and I cried. 

Then 8 years filled with empty promises of visits. Every single thing she “sent” me “got lost” in the mail. Not to mention she said she said never got child support; which I found out was a lie. 

My daughter tested into early kindergarten. I told my mom weeks ago I didn’t want to talk to her, but she’s never been told “no.” She started freaking out and calling me, threatening to drive to my state, pick me and my daughter up. I told her I’d talk to her when I was ready and needed space. She proceeded to continue to message me over the next few weeks. I stayed no contact, until I finally told her I’d call her later. That was mistake #1. She bombarded me with more messages asking me to call constantly. I went no contact for another week or so, then finally gave in and called her yesterday. That was mistake #2. She proceeded to make the same empty promises to my daughter that she made to me, reaffirming my decision to go no contact. I mentioned my daughter was starting school, She asked me when and where and what she needed. I told her it was a school around where I used I live, but gave her no information beyond that. I told her she didn’t need anything because we were taking care of it. She always tries to insert herself and be the third parent when she wasn’t even a first parent to me,  and she constantly tries to undermine my ex, or make dads out to be unnecessary.

Next year in May, my baby will be having her kinder grad, and I’m extremely inclined to not mention/invite her. I don’t want her to play grandma of the year, she’s not even grandma of the week.

It was the first time we ever threw her a bday party and I spent months planning it, only for her to steal that special moment of opening her first bday party present.

"AITA for putting my dad's relationship at risk by not letting him confiscate my Switch?. Okay, this is more like ""*was* I the asshole"", as this was almost two years ago and it's been resolved. Still something I want to hear more opinions about, though.

October 2017, my final year of High School, and exams were coming up. I had a history of not doing the best in School, but that year things had been looking up and I was fairly certain I'd pass. I had enough Level 3 NCEA (NZ high school qualification) cr

My dad and his partner really hated it when I was given resubmission opportunities because they ""didn't have them"" when they were in School, or because ""you won't get any resubs in university!"", so because I got a couple, they really weren't happy with the way I was still passing high school.

I had been working at a grocery store, and was making a decent amount of money. I decided to buy myself a Nintendo Switch. I didn't tell them at first because they don't like gaming, and I knew they would throw a shit fit. The first item to arrive was the carry case, and when my dad's partner asked me what it was, I told her it was a carry case for a new handheld game console I ordered. She wasn't happy about it.

Later, I was called into the lounge where they told me that when my Switch arrived, they'd confiscate it, because they were concerned that it would be a ""distraction"" for me, with my exams coming up. I thought it was ridiculous, because I was *18*, it was my property, and I bought it with my own money. I tried arguing that it would be no more of a distraction than my gaming laptop, which I had full access to without it being a distraction.

The day the Switch arrived, I hid it under some clothes in my bottom drawer because I had to go to work and I didn't trust them enough to leave it sitting on my desk. When I got back, the Switch was GONE. I was pissed and went to talk to them. They were upset that I'd hidden it from them and took it away. I argued, but they wouldn't listen. Later I convinced my dad to give it to me for a short while so I could see if it was functional. I didn't give it back.

At the end of the week, my dad's partner was pissed, packed her things, and left (she stayed during weekdays to work at a local school) because she thought I was ""walking all over"" my dad by refusing to give him my property. He got even more pissed at me, turned off the WiFi, acted passive-aggressive and grumpy, and even put a user account control password on my laptop ""just because (he) can"". At one point he wanted me to live with my grandparents just to get his partner back, but that never happened. After a couple of weeks, he threatened to *smash* it if I didn't give it to him. I caved in and didn't get it back until after school was finished. She returned, and we sort of left it at ""no hard feelings"".

I still think it's a ridiculous ordeal, but both of them seemed really upset with me for not letting my property be taken as an adult. Their relationship was put at risk because of it. Am I the asshole?

**EDIT:** Hey guys, thanks for the replies. I thought I'd explain some things:

* I wasn't paying rent (dad's partner suggested it to him a few times after High School was done but he never followed through).
* My grades were pretty good, while I was getting a couple of resubs, I was passing most things and was actually doing great in English and at least one other class (can't remember which one).
* By ""history of not doing the best"", I meant that I didn't pass NCEA Level 1 in year 11 (10th grade?) and needed a little help to get through Level 2. I wasn't struggling in Level 3.

"AITA for not giving my dog back to its previous owner?. So this is kind of an odd situation and I will try to explain it as briefly as possible.

3 years ago my dog of 14 years passed away, I (20f if it’s relevant) had been so lonely without my little buddy that a few months back I contacted a breeder about getting a Golden retriever pup. The breeder messaged me back saying she did have a new litter but she also had a 3 year old dog that sounded perfect for me and highly recommended I meet him. I absolutely fell in love with this dog (let’s call him Buddy) and immediately let her know I wanted to adopt him.

She explained to me that his previous family had given him up 4 months ago because they were too busy for him and THEY NEVER BOTHERED TO POTTY TRAIN HIM so they got mad when he went to the bathroom on the floors. I was up for the challenge and Buddy was really easy to train he just needed some attention and commitment.

I love this dog. We have really bonded these past few months and he’s very happy and attached to me. 

But a few days ago I got a message from the original owner of the dog asking for him back. According to this family, they didn’t know they were giving Buddy up and assumed they could have him back when they felt like it. Keep in mind they signed away on this and I am legally the dogs owner in every way- the breeder told them that she would be finding a new home for Buddy. So I messaged the family back and (in the most polite way I could) told them absolutely no they could not have him back. I thought it was over with but a few minutes ago I got another message and apparently they had STALKED my social media for pictures of the dog and told me he looked much happier when he was with them.

It was going great till 2 months ago, I got an opportunity to become a key member of an emerging company. I was a bit reluctant because of the work hours but my SO convinced me to go for it since there was a massive salary hike too. 

 It required a lot more extra effort from my part and I often work 12-16 hours a day now. I ended you liking what I did, and my salary almost doubled. The ratio was now about 5:1 in terms of how much we contributed. Not saying I don't let her treat herself with our money, I obviously did... but I expected to at least come home with less dishes in the sink and vacuuming done.

Apparently not, I often end up staying up till 12 am and wake up at 4am. I confronted her about this yesterday. She goes out to watch movies and binge watches Netflix, something we used to do together, everyday. I honestly couldn't handle it anymore.

Yesterday,I didn't shout or anything, I just told her that we should honestly consider changing the agreement and she should ideallydoing a little more work. When she said that I had promised on the 50/50. 
I told her straightaway that I couldn't handle it.
I told her that I would be fine with doing a good amount of things, just not an equal amount or the majority of the work load. 

She suddenly just broke down and slammed the door shut. Saying I was supposed to be a good guy but I had somehow made it all worst. 
Mostly because of the door muffing my voice, I shouted and told her I did my fucking best being a good guy for the people around me.( but I do confess that there was a trace of anger and aggression.) She told me to fuck off and I ended up sleeping in the other bedroom.


Today at work I was getting bombarded with messages from her friend's on how I am being a complete moron and should better bring a box of her favorite chocolates by the time I reach home.


I am at a local library now, honestly a bit stressed out....I genuinely need some help and even constructive criticism is welcome.

I honestly might be the asshole, this is probably more of a confirmation. I am ready to listen to criticism and improve myself in any way possible.
I am just stressed out.


EDIT:I pay most of the bills, we have a joint account where I contribute roughly 5 times more as her. I wanted to clarify since someone asked, thanks. She works about 30-40 hours a week, and I work about 90 hours now. I wanted to clarify since some of you seen confused about that too. 
Sorry for not wording it too properly, I am honestly a bit tensed.

I am not worried or arrogant about making more money, I earned thrice as much earlier too, and we have a joint account. The main problem is honestly time from my side.","NTA - Firstly, it was a fair 50/50 when you Both worked the same hours. It's nowhere near being an asshole to ask her to do a bit more.

Secondly - close that joint account, take your money and open your own account. If you and her want a joint account then deposit equal money. Everything should be split equal.

Lastly - you are in a relationship with her not her friends. It's not appropriate for them to be texting you and demanding you do things and callinhg you names.

I would really consider sitting her down explaining you work longer, contribute more and would like her to help out more. Judging by her reaction to this you should probably think about a new relationship. ",0,0,0,0,1
"WIBTA if I gave my mom $5K and mostly cut her out of my life?. Mom has been sober for 10+ years.  But, when I was growing up, she was not sober: verbally abusive, manipulative, and didn't contribute around the house.  Dad divorced her and she left when I was 11.  Had no contact through middle school and very little in high school.  Contact re-established in college, and I lived with her for \~6 months right after graduation (split rent). She got substantial divorce settlement, alimony for 7 years, and a low 6 figure inheritance, but blew through all of it without working full time. She smokes, is very overweight, and has multiple chronic medical problems (including recent back surgery). A few years ago, I started helping with financial advice (budgeting, debt consolidation, taxes, etc.), which has objectively helped her financial situation a lot.  Initially, I genuinely wanted to help/rebuild our relationship. Lately, I just want to mitigate the severity of the impending financial disaster to reduce the guilt I'm afraid I'll have when I'm unwilling to provide direct financial assistance.  I've been clear that at no point will I help her with direct financial assistance. She has less than $50K to her name, early sixties, projected SS benefits of less than $20K per year, and doesn't own a home.

I don't enjoy time with her. She constantly complains about her health/other people, or asks for favors. She refuses to take steps to improve her life, like diet, PT, or exercise. She blew off mandatory physical therapy. 

She's had trouble holding jobs, and recently decided to drop from full-time to part-time (no change in physical requirements, just less hours), losing her health insurance and taking a 60%+ pay cut (she was already barely making rent). She says its due to back pain, and plans to look for a full time ""desk job."" She calls me \*after\* she carried out this decision, and asks for help on a ""plan"" to deal with it. The next day, I find her subsidized health insurance options and share details. She doesn't thank me... she just says ""well I need to make sure I can keep my doctor.""

Basically, she dumps her problems on me instead of taking ownership. I don't get any joy out of a relationship with her (and didn't as a child) and neither does my wife. WIBTA if I cut her out of our day-to-day lives (with explanation, not just ghosting).  I'd expect to still see her a few times a year around holidays.  I think this will result in her being in a materially worse financial situation 3-5 years from now without my active, prodding help.

Additionally, when my brother and I got married (5 and 2 years ago), she gave us each a ring (hers and her moms) to trade in towards our wives rings. Cash value of $2.5K, ""trade"" value of $5K.

"AITA for not wanting to tell my daughter that her biological father does not care to be a part of her life?. My husband (who is not my daughter’s biological father, but has been more of a father-figure in her life than her biological father has) and I just got into an argument because he says I am wrong for not wanting to tell her that her biological father doesn’t care much to see or speak to her.

A bit of background, my daughter is eight years old. Her father hasn’t been very active in her life since she was born. He’s been in and out of her life, only seeing her maybe 3-4 times a year. Despite this, she loves him, constantly wants to see and speak to him, and doesn’t really see anything wrong with their relationship. She’s a child, still very oblivious to how toxic her relationship with her father is. 
When he does see her, he is great to her, but it’s the fact that he makes no effort to be an active part of her life that is upsetting. 

I basically have to take the initiative, contact him, and set up a date and time for him to see her, otherwise he would never see her. I do this for her sake, as she loves him, and seeing him makes her happy. She’s constantly asking me if she can go spend time with him.

The argument between my husband and I came about after I vented to him that I reached out to my daughter’s father and asked him if he would like to spend some time with our daughter before her and I leave town on vacation for the next few months. Her father never responded. This upset me, but it’s nothing new or surprising. I went to my husband to vent my frustrations on the situation.

This is where my husband suggested I stop trying to force her father to be an active part of her life. He also suggested that I tell my daughter that her father doesn’t care about her, doesn’t care to spend time with her, and doesn’t care to see or speak to her. His exact words were “Tell her the truth that her dad don’t give a fuck about her or seeing her.” I found this to be extremely harsh and inappropriate, and was appalled that he even suggest I say something like that to a child.

I believe it to be best to just allow her to figure it out on her own when she is older, mature, and capable of having a better understanding. I believe one day she will see her father for what he really is and that it is not my place to share such harsh and heartbreaking info with her at such a young age. 

My husband disagrees and states that when she is older, she will resent me for keeping this from her. From this point on, our discussion spiraled into a huge argument where he basically kept stating that I’m in the wrong and I’m the asshole in the situation.

AITA for not wanting to tell my daughter that her dad doesn’t care to be a part of her life?","NTA  


You are absolutely correct in how you have been handling it. It's not your job to say things like that to her, because she will resent you for telling her that and she won't believe you because she loves her dad.

"WIBTA if I give my best friend a wakeup call because her daughter must go on a diet, ASAP!. I and my best friend are friends for more than 12 years. We are neighbors and basically see each other every day. We even were pregnant at the same time, and we both were overweight (238 lbs.).

After my second child I decided to lose weight and managed to lose 70, 50 lbs.

By then, it was already a difficult period, because she doesn´t (want to?) made the effort and I didn´t push her. But I was doing so well, that our relationship changed. I had that feeling that she thinks that I am now judging her for not losing weight. I was definitely not. I just changed my eating habits and let cake, snacks and soda untouched, when I was at hers (she didn´t listen when I told her, that she doesn´t have to serve me these things, I will not eat/drink i anyway). She even nag once in a while, because of my new behaviour and that I should go easy on that. I just thought she was jealous and didn´t want to argue about it, but sometimes her comments were just annoying. I just did my thing because I felt great for me, and sorry for her. No need to risk our friendship.

After years, our kids grew and it was visible, that her daughter (a few months younger then my son) already struggles with her weight. At one point my friend said herself, that her daughter should lose some weight, she already complains that her feets hurt. The daughter had almost 117 lbs. at the age of 8.

I tried to give some advices, carefully since our relationship is already different since my weight loss. I told her only basic things and offered my help. She was not mad at me, she mentioned it first, but she was neither happy about me not being more supportive in that way she thought I would be (to say things like “she will grow out of it”, “when it starts to border her, she will lose weight on her own”).

Needless to say, that our friendship suffers even more and that’s why I struggle with my decision. Because, I was at my friend´s house yesterday (after not seeing them for a while) and when I saw her daughter it hits me right in my face. She gained so much weight, I couldn´t believe this was even possible. Of course I didn´t say anything, I was just happy to see them. But I am really concerned about her health. My friend´s mother told me, that her granddaughter has now 172 lbs. at the age of 10. Granny is also worried and argues a lot with my friend, but she just refuses to listen.

I want to tell her to take professional help. First from a doctor, than from a nutritionist, and of course the help of family and friends.

"WIBTA if I told my manager to either drop the dress code issue or I’m quitting on the spot?. The title sounds a little abrasive but hear me out. 

For the sake of sounding like I’m bragging, and inb4 I start getting inboxes telling me to prove it, I have a curvier body type. This is relevant because dress pants, what my manager wants us all to wear for work, are form fitting and hug my hips and thighs. I cannot size up either because it looks like I have a saggy diaper and it sags at the waist even with a belt. 

My female manager pulled me aside after my first week there and told me the dress pants won’t be appropriate for me and said that I could wear black jeans instead. 

I have three pairs of work jeans that I cycle through and my manager says they are all too tight. I bartend so I’m not walking all over the place; i’m literally behind a bar so most patrons just see me from the waist up. 

I’m not sure if this is an issue among the other managers because she is the only one confronting me, but she is also the only female manager so idk if the men would be comfortable broaching a subject like this. 

Finally today she told me I’d get written up if I don’t find pants that are less form fitting. As much as I wanted to tell her policing body types isn’t in the handbook but bad breathe is, I just told her I’d try but I’m wearing jeans that fit me rather than sag. 

I work tomorrow and I think I’m going to tell the district manager what’s going on finally and if the comments don’t stop, I’m quitting the next time it happens.

"AITA for not noticing my wife cut two inches off her hair and made it one shade darker immediately?. For some context my wife is a hair stylist and is in school for aesthetics now. They still have access to the salon to do their hair and stuff though in this program. 

Last night my wife messages me saying she has a surprise for me when she gets home. Awesome! However, she got home later than expected and I had to go to bed. This morning she wakes up and finds me in the dark garage with our two year old. He’s really into cars now and likes to mess with the full size car with me. 

Anyway she comes in and I’m watching him making sure he doesn’t get hurt bc hey it’s a car. Then I remember the surprise so I ask what it was with her behind me. No response. I turn around when I have a sec and she doesn’t say anything so I ask again after I turn my attention back to our son. 

She then gets very upset about me not noticing she changed her color from regular brown to slightly darker and cut off maybe an inch to two inches. I told her I would have def noticed inside the house but it’s early in the morning and the bulbs in our garage are burnt out at the moment. So in the garage there is virtually zero difference between her hair color now and then. 

The length yes I probably should have thought was the surprise but I didn’t bc we had discussed her wanting to do it a couple days ago. In great length. So my thought process was “a haircut we talked about can’t be the surprise”

Also in the texts she said after a few back and forth me asking what it was she said “you’ll have to wait! But I *have* something for you you’ll love!”

So I thought it was a physical item in general from that or food possibly?

I don’t want her to feel like I don’t notice these things because I try really hard to take notice bc it’s important to her. 

Also to tag along with this: at one point she was cutting and dying her hair almost every week. Am I the asshole in that situation for not gushing over even minor changes everytime they were made? 

I feel like yes I do need to notice when my wife is excited about things but I’m not good with hair or make up looks. So her being mad at me for not noticing the difference between brown and slightly darker brown off the bat is something that’s always been a challenge and I don’t feel like her being mad about very minor difference being unnoticed is cool. 

I wouldn’t expect her to notice if I got a new wrench that’s darker colored or a new set of guitar picks because that’s not her forte. 

Also in general what can I do to combat this or help her to understand slight changes are harder for me to notice when I’m busy but I do *always* notice them when I’m not. 

TL;DR - didn’t notice my wife cut her hair by an inch or two and colored it one to one and a half shades darker brown than it already was and she is not happy about it. Am I the asshole here?","No rating

"AITA for refusing to buy my(21M) GF(20F) cigarettes now?. 
So my GF and I have been together 2 years now. 

We both have smoked on and off our entire relationship. My habit was always worse than hers. It takes her about a week maybe two to smoke a pack where as I can go though a pack in two days. About a week ago I realized how awful it really makes me feel and I’ve decided to stop all together. I’m quitting cold turkey. 

My GF on the other hand has decided to keep smoking which is 100% her business. BUT we do live in a state where the smoking age has recently been changed to 21 and she is not grand fathered in. So for the past few months I’ve had to be the one to buy her cigarettes. She always pays for them and it wasn’t really a big deal since I already buy her alcohol and stuff. 

But now that I’ve stopped I don’t really feel all that comfortable buying them for her. It makes me feel like it would just be easier to buy them for myself as well and also I don’t want to be the one enabling her bad habit. 

Today she asked me if I could pick her up a pack when I stopped for gas and when I told her no she got pissed. She told me I wasn’t her father and that because I quit didn’t mean she needed to and a bunch of other things. I tried to explain but she is not seeing my side.

"WIBTA for asking my college roommate to stop sleeping on the futon and do her laundry more often?. Okay so I met this girl through the Facebook group for new students in the winter of senior year. She seemed nice enough and I drove to her city (about 5 hours away) to meet her. We decided to be roommates after meeting in person. We didn't talk much about our cleanliness habits (HUGE mistake). 

&#x200B;

So after getting to school, I realize this girl is the DIRTIEST girl I have possibly ever met. She never does laundry, and keeps her laundry bag (of dirty clothes!) right next to my desk. It is so overfilled that sometimes dirty underwear will fall on the floor. Granted, the room is small and she is an out of state student so she brings more clothes than me. But, I keep my dirty clothes in a bag in my closet. NOT right next to her desk. It is embarrassing to have friends in the room because some of them have pointed this out. To make matters worse, she used to keep them right next to the futon where friends sit. So the other spot she picked was right next to my desk. I didn't fight it at the time, as I would rather it be here than next to the futon, but it is disgusting. 

&#x200B;

The second thing she does to annoy me is sleep on the futon. I'm not talking about sleeping on the futon once a week when she gets home plastered at 3 am. It is every single night. It is bothersome because she often does not wake up until noon or 1pm, therefore, me or any friends I have over cannot sit on the futon. I feel like I have to tiptoe around my own room when I get ready for class, as she is usually sleeping on the futon right there. Often times when she leaves for class she will leave her stuff strewn all over the futon, as she uses it like her bed! I have mentioned to her that I would prefer she would sleep in her bed, so she stopped sleeping on the futon for a few weeks. This was about 3 months ago. However, after her friends came to visit (week after winter break) and THEY slept on the futon, she started doing it again! 

&#x200B;

She does other things to bother me, but those are the main two that really drive me crazy. I provide most of the cleaning supplies for the room and do ALL of the cleaning. Her idea of cleaning is to throw clothes in her closet, whereas I actually wipe stuff down, vacuum, take out the trash etc.

*A bit of info: her family is incredibly rich, as in, her dad just built a 10 bedroom house for a family of four (this is the U.K. so that is incredibly, incredibly expensive!). I, am very low middle class at best - so we’re very different in this regard.*

Anyway, so I said that it’s really good how she’ll always have something to fall back on and asked which part of the business she’ll work in (they have loads of different things going on). 

She replied she wants to be a waitress which, truthfully, kinda shocked me since waitresses get paid very little and I said that to her. 
I also mentioned that she should train to be an architect (she’s very artsy) or something similar and that way she could draw up the plans for the houses her dad builds.

However, she said that her dad has already bought her a house and he’ll give her whatever money she wants, the job is just something to do. Then went on to say that she’ll never go to uni because it’s a waste of time. 

I said that some of us need to go university to have a chance at getting a good job and a decent quality of life, but she literally laughed at me as if what I said was absurd and said that if I really wanted to be successful that my family should’ve just started their own business, that I wouldn’t be in this ‘mess’. (Even though I’d go to uni even if I was rich - it just seems to make sense)

I explained that it takes loads of money, time, etc. to start a business. but she didn’t believe me and kept saying it just takes a little bit of hard work and that university is completely useless. That if anyone in my family had put effort in we’d be a lot better off.

Maybe what she said is true, but then again, businesses often fail and I told her so, but also said that she was completely spoilt and clueless about the world if she thinks becoming rich is that easy and if she thinks that everyone is in the position to take massive financial risks to potentially reach that point.

So much so that I've become somewhat submissive to her every wants and needs, if I can afford them, which most of the time, I can. She's not a gold digger, by any means, she doesn't even wear much jewelry. We even have our own bank accounts; we each got our own expenses to pay for, so that's how it's gonna be until I'm out of college and got my dream 6 figure job.

For now, though, I only have a retail job. And it's pay is crap, like next to nothing for the amount of bills I have and for the lack of hours I can put in thanks to classes. I don't really blame anyone though, it is what it is. But because of that, it's kind of taken a damper on my social life, and leaves me broke to pay for other items outside of necessities, like video games, or in this case, a phone for her.

See, last week, she dropped her phone in the bathtub. Completely ruined, not even that old rice trick worked. So, she had to get herself a new one. Only problem was, her job, which is she's a beautician, isn't giving out a lot of work recently with the weather getting colder, so she's kind of low on cash herself. So, very politely, she asked me to help her. She only needs $50 to afford the phone.

Problem is, I don't have it. But at the same time, I do, that's why I'm here.

See, I DO have $50, but after bills, which took over half my paycheck, I only have about $80 or so left after filling up my gas tank. And being a millennial in college, even that is hard to go by nowadays. So if I were to give her the $50, I'd only have a little over $30 to last me for a whole week. 

So I explained the situation, and I told her I won't give her the money. She gets mad, saying she will pay me back later on in the week, and that she really needs another phone so she can talk to her friends and to keep in touch with me when we're apart. While I want to believe that she'll pay me back, I'm kind of afraid that something will come along in the next week that I will need money for that I won't have, like say if my car breaks down or I need a new book for class. Plus, with the amount of work she's getting, which is next to none, I don't want her to strap herself for me like I would do for her.

"AITA Mother announces to everyone in the house (including current guest) that I'm naked. Not sure if this belongs here, but I was plenty embarrassed and may have overreacted.
I was having a lazy day at home in my pajamas. Usually, I don't bother putting on a bra if I'm just home by myself, so I didn't have one on, but I was wearing a full set of pajamas; matching tank top and shorts. My sister was home with me and we were in full TV-binge mode, sprawled out on the couch, empty chip bag, ice cream, unshowered and braless. I was literally stuffing rice in my face as my mother walks through the front door with a house guest (whom I usually quite enjoy spending time with) in tow.

Now, I'm horribly socially anxious under normal circumstances, but add that to that the fact that I was in no condition to be seen by another human being, I jumped from the couch and ran upstairs. I heard my mother call my name so I stopped at the top of the landing and turned around. She appears from around the corner and first starts berating me for unwashed dishes and leaving the rice maker on (wasn't me, but I use it the most so I see why she'd assume). Then after scolding me within ear-shot of a house guest, she says something to the effect of: ""You should probably go to your room. Hannah (not real name) is here and you're in the buff.""

So now, she has effectively announced to this person (that I have to see at least once a week at work) that I'm buck-ass nude, which I wasn't.

I have pajamas on."", but my mother basically ignores me and turns to Hannah and says while laughing: ""She'll spend a whole week in the same pajamas.""

"AITA for getting mad that my adoptive parents' best friend treats me poorly and now want to avoid him at all costs?. So the story is that my adoptive dad and I work together at a construction company. 
His best friend, let's call him Tyler works there as well. 

My dad and Tyler have been best friends for 14 years now. 
I got adopted recently. 

Tyler has been rude to me since day 1 of meeting him. 
I'm hard of hearing and he got frustrated that I couldn't hear him on a job site (Due to heavy machinery)  so he yelled at me in front of 30+ people and demanded I sit in the truck since I ""can't bother to listen"". 
I tried explaining to him that I'm hard of hearing and he laughed in my face. 

I felt so emberassed and this incident still gives me nightnares to this day. 

For months now I feel uncomfortable anytime Tyler is around. 

Tyler will insult me and talk poorly in front of my managers about me despite being asked to stop. 
Tyler also told the management my dad is stupid for adopting me. 

My adoptive dad told me that him and Tyler are best friends and that will never change regardless of how he treats me or what he has to say.

"AITA for getting mad at my neighbor for asking my mom for some money?. So let me give some back story. Around January my neighbor(Who is on his late 20s) asked me to lend him 20$. And told me he would pay me back in 2 weeks so i said no biggie. After 2 weeks had past i messaged him and he said he just started working at a new place and they won't pay him till next week so i told him ok and kept waiting. Next week came around and asked him if he had the 20$, he came at me another excuse but that he would have the money in two more weeks. At this point i was so understanding but then i started seeing his snapchat stories of him getting high on weed, doing cocaine and drinking beer through my sisters snap. So i confronted him about it and he came with more excuses. After ghosting me completely for the next month he finally paid me back. He also made me go pick it up at his house too lmao. Anyways i made that part longer than it should but it just shows how much i trust that guy with "" borrowing "" money. Yeah its only 20$ but idc. Its the fact that he took so long and came with just excuses when he knew he had the money. Well anyways yesterday morning he asked me if i could lend him 20$ again so i told him i didnt have cash. He then ASKED ME TO ASK MY MOM TO LEND HIM SOME CASH. Again, i told him my mom didnt have any money to loan. He said ok and went on about his day until 5pm. I received a text from him saying that he asked my mom for 20$ and she said yes, ( i was kinda pissed but w.e) then he told me to GO DROP IT OFF AT HIS HOUSE thats when i snapped and just told him to not be asking my mother for money, we are currently struggleling with our business, with my dads residential status(we payed 10k to a lawyer) and with my little sisters cause they just got back to school with just very little supplies. Ontop of that we are paying hospitals and doctors appointments cause i had a tumor taken off my brain 2 months ago.

"AITA for threatening my employers if I don't get my way?. Hello! Throwaway because duh.

So I'm a trans woman, who has been on medication (HRT) for about a year. I'm at the point where I can no longer hide my breasts, and its time for me to start transitioning in the workplace. Now, when I was just starting my medication, I informed the manager and HR of the branch of the midsize company I work for what was going on, telling them I was going to work with them so we had a smooth transition. I've been very giving, and willing to teach them the basics and be very gentle when they unintentionally say offensive things (I've responded to them with sentences such as ""I'm happy to explain this to you, but just so you know the thing you just said is considered very offensive by trans people because of XYZ""). Basically, I like my job and want to keep it, but I'm also making sure it is a safe and comfortable place for me.

So, with my employers being informed that things are coming to a head soon and that we need to make plans for me to work full time under my new name/as a woman, they're getting difficult. Telling me that thing X we agreed to do is not going to happen, and that I have no say in how this information about myself is disseminated. The final straw came when a member of the management team asked me for very invasive information about my medical treatment as a condition of publicly transitioning, and requiring that I use the two unisex bathrooms on premises instead of using the women's bathrooms.

I live in a very liberal west coast state, and I know that what they are requesting of me is not legal in this state. I tried telling them nicely that I disliked what they were saying. Finally, I went off on them. I told them that what they wanted was not legal, and that I honestly didn't have to include them at all in this process, I was doing so to help them deal with any ripples that could come from it in a controlled environment. I finally threatened them legally, and told them that if things didn't happen the way that **I** wanted them to, then I would circumvent their entire process, and there wasn't anything they could do about it.

People in my personal life are split. Some are glad I stood up for myself when management refused to listen to my polite requests, and some think that I'm making things adversarial (and being an asshole) for no reason, and I should capitulate to their way of doing it.

So which is it? AITA?

Edit: someone asked what they were refusing to do, so i'm copy/pasting my response in here.

It is also putting all of the onus on me having to come out to  literally every  individual person who I speak to in person, and who I  work with (Our office houses about 500 people, probably half to two  thirds of who will see me on a day to day basis), not to mention people  starting gossip when I come in in womens clothing, or the outrage it  will cause when I start using the women's restroom.

"AITA for wanting a life of my own away from my parents?. My parents have coddled me and my brother for our whole lives. We're both undergrad college students right now. They also are super overprotective of us and didn't let us hang out with our own cousins or neighbors for long periods of time when we were children, so they were selective of who we were around or were influenced by. They track our phones with Find my iPhone and we were often lectured if we turned off find my iphone, turned off our phones, or didn't let them know where we were. My dad, mom, and brother are very nosy. There have been many occasions where I have had my texts snooped on, and I never was able to keep any of my personal relationships secretive.

My parents are really like... old style and aren't accepting at all. They didn't give me a choice on where I could go to college. They wanted me to go to a specific college which has a ""good reputation"" in our area and seems to be the ""best"" college. I put quotes around these because this college offers the same programs that any other ""lower"" colleges in my area offer. So I was forced to go to that college. Parents were disappointed when my brother didn't get into that college and had to go to the second best option. He's trying to transfer to my college now.

My brother on the other hand isn't as vocal as me. He just stays quiet and obeys anything they say. If you compared me to him and my parents, I would be the rebel or the odd one out. He's the favorite child. He agrees with them about the reputation and college stuff, so I have no one to really rely on or agree with.

My parents say that they worked very hard for us to get where we are, and for us to get to college. I'm first generation and they're immigrants, so they want us to earn lots of money with jobs that we can get with education and not physical labor jobs. They always say that me or my brother will buy them a house in the future and that our first check or at least a portion of our salary will go to them. They say that we have to take care of them when we're older and expect us to do so. Sometimes they joke, but most of the time they're serious. They won't let us move away from them because they expect us to support them when we're older.

I always contest and say that I'm moving far away from them to do my own thing. I don't want all that I've worked for to go to my parents first before I can do stuff for myself, like support my own family. My parents call me ungrateful sometimes for wanting to do my own thing. I know that they worked hard for me and put in a lot of money for me, but it just seems unfair that they want most of my salary in the future to go to them. It's also unfair how they treated me and how they gave me almost no choice in my own education. If they hadn't forced me to do so many things and been so overprotective, then maybe in the future I would help them out. AITA for wanting to have my own life away from them?","NTA you have the right to do your own thing, and you're old enough to live your life. They shouldn't hover over you and your brother.

"WIBTA if I stopped talking to my friend just because he has feelings for me and I don’t?. I’m currently 20 years old and so is my friend. 

This all started in our senior year in high school. He asked me to prom on Valentine’s Day right as I was coming out of a difficult test so I was really stressed at the moment. I thought he was asking because we had a conversation where I said no one was gonna ask me to be their date for prom. I thought he was doing it out of pity or because he was a being a good friend. My answer was yeah sure my friend, I ain’t going with anyone else anyway. I honestly felt bad afterwards and when I asked my friends they said my answer was a bit rude. But it was like an automatic response and at the moment I was feeling a bit overwhelmed so I blamed that on bad timing. 

Months later I found out that he had feelings for me when he asked and that he was really hurt by my answer and had stopped having feelings for me. I still went to prom with him. I thought that was the last time I’d see him since we were going to different universities so I never said anything.

Almost a year passed and I hadn’t heard from him. But I kept in touch with a mutual friend. I hadn’t seen her since high school and she invited me to a get together so we could catch up and I agreed to go. On my way to the party she told me he was going to be there too. I didn’t think anything of it because a lot of time had passed and I thought we all had moved on. At the party he was acting normal and we talked like before nothing was out of the ordinary.

The next day he sent me a text and we started talking again occasionally. I always treated him as a friend and nothing else. After talking for a while he invited me to the movies and I agreed to go. I thought it was a normal thing for friends to do so I didn’t overthink. We both really like going to the movies so it kind of became our thing. It was always the two of us so I guess that’s what went wrong here. Maybe that gave him the wrong impression. After the second time he made a point of getting there really early and buying the tickets and popcorn for the two of us. At first I tried to pay him back but he didn’t accept that’s when I realized that maybe he thought we were going out on dates and not hanging out as friends. I started to tell him that maybe we should invite other people with us but somehow we always end up alone. The way he treats me it’s clear he started to have feelings for me again. 

I’ve never clearly said to his face that I don’t like him m but I think I’ve made myself very clear by my actions that I see him as my friend. I still think that he is getting the wrong idea and thinks he has a chance. Recently I’ve stopped hanging out with him as much. He’s become a really good friend of mine the thing is I don’t think I’ll ever have feelings for him or that he’ll ever stop having feelings for me.

"AITA for socially ostracizing my manager and getting her fired?. This one happened ~6 years ago but I still think about it from time to time.

I was hired for my first job (a contract position) at a convention for my hobby. I was thrilled to work at a huge-name company with great benefits making cool things, and grateful to this manager for having taken a chance on me. After 6 months I was upgraded from contractor to full-time employee and moved from the large team I started at to an intimate team of 6 people, working directly under my manager as the only non-remote employee in our dept.

Our team worked crazy hours, got little sleep, and were threatened with being disbanded for months. We became very close under those adverse circumstances. Eventually we got out of the danger zone and were able to bring more members to the team, which was nice. The dynamic remained close and we continued to put in long hours. One night I was there at 2am with my manager, and we were drinking since it was after hours in a very alcohol-friendly company, and she confessed that she really liked me. She asked me to break up with my girlfriend and date her instead, semi-jokingly. I laughed it off and said I couldn't do that, but felt disquieted. 

The next day I was wary since I had no idea she felt that way up until then, and started to question if maybe I'd been hired for my appearance and not my work (the person I was hired to replace was my boss's ex (I later found out), and VERY similar in looks to me). My manager asked if I was okay and I said yes but decided to be distant, which changed the vibe. She crossed the line imo when she scheduled a 1:1 during work hours to ask if ""we were cool"" and to talk about interpersonal things. After that I felt her watching me constantly, she'd leave work the same time to talk to me in the parking lot, and would try to corner me to check in on things when I was by myself... eventually I asked a male friend to warn me when she was around because I was so stressed. Our coworkers noticed and I didn't want to tell them about everything so I brushed their questions off, but it was obvious I was avoiding her. The exec of the 10 person team also pulled me aside and asked if I was being harassed but I said no... this situation was made more complicated by the fact that she was trans, and I identified as such as well at the time but did not present. I didn't want to seem transphobic OR have to out myself if that came up. Our big boss was a very Baby Boomer kind of guy who made fun of minorities casually and I didn't want to disclose info to him in particular, although I'm sure he would have done something fair about it. Eventually the team began eating and spending time together without her and after 3 months of being shunned, she quit. 

In hindsight I feel like I contributed to bullying, BUT I also feel like she crossed a huge line with someone she had a lot of professional leverage over, and that I had no choice but to actively avoid her or expose both of us to some overpersonal corporate questions.","NTA, whoa that was quite the situation. Definitely do not blame yourself for any of that. The only thing I think you could have done differently is informed your exec and HR immediately after that incident happened.

"AITA for possibly getting someone kicked out of university?. So this wasn’t recent but I always get mixed reactions on this when I tell people this story. Pretty sure most people think I’m an asshole snitch, but I’m still not 100% convinced that what I did was wrong.

College history course, large lecture of about 250-300 people, pretty difficult. I won’t lie, I started out the semester blowing it off but quickly realized that wasn’t an option after receiving a stellar 42 on my first exam. After that, I stopped jerking around in class and my grades began to improve with some hard work. 

Cue the dude I screwed over. Typical fratty dude that obviously is just keg standing his way through his trust fund (sorry). 98% of his time in that class was snap chatting or watching ESPN recaps on his phone. I will admit I’m a judgmental asshole, but that’s obviously not my business and it’s his choice so I ignored it. It’s college and there are plenty of people like him.

Fast forward to test 2. I crammed and prepared for days because I did not need another test to fuck me raw like the first time. Important note, these are not multiple choice exams. You are given the topic the week of the exam, you do your research and write yourself a pretty outline at home, and on exam day you crap out anything you remember in essay form. Difficult but it became manageable when I put the work in. 
Anyway, I’m about halfway through this exam when for some reason, my eyes wander to frat daddy next to me. That’s when I notice, underneath his essay packet is his ENTIRE ESSAY OUTLINE. The whole fucking essay, pre-written, and he was sliding it from underneath to copy word for word. Idk but I didn’t spare a moment to consider my next move. I immediately got up and went to a TA (teaching assistant)

Me: “hey, so I’m gonna pretend I’m getting more writing paper from you, but the guy next to me is cheating, hardcore”

TA: *starts to fucking walk to the dudes aisle*

Me: *stops him* “DUDE give me the paper please”

I thought I did this artfully. However, from the TA’s vantage point and disadvantage of having to seem nonchalant, they didn’t catch him. I was informed after the class to let the professor know if it happens again. 

(For the record, since he didn’t get caught he still got the grade on that exam, and of course made a grade higher than me and got to fucking keep it. A+.)

Fast forward one more time to the 3rd and final exam. I’m in my own head, furiously word vomiting about colonization or something. Almost forgot about frat man next to me. Chuckled in my head thinking there was no way he could be doing it again. Nah. No way.

He’s fucking doing it again. 
This time, I don’t get up. The professor was already hovering in the vicinity. All it took this time was dead eye contact between myself and the professor, followed by a swift eye jerk in the direction of the cheater. Professor stormed down our aisle, demanded the dudes papers. Could feel the guy practically shit himself. Hesitantly follows the order and finally gets dragged out of the class.

In my uni, the honor code states that punishment can range from a failing grade on that exam or being failed for the whole class. It can even, on request of the professor, be taken to the honors council where they can make an even more serious decision of removing said person from certain university programs or even the university itself. Honestly, the professor seemed fucking fumed about it, so I don’t know to what extent he took it.

Looking back at it now, part of me realizes that this wasn’t high school; a days detention and a smack on the wrist was not all this guy was gonna get. But at the time I was PISSED, being someone who actually worked for the good grade just to have someone who did nothing to blow through the class was entirely.

But, I snitched. That’s the basic offense against me but really, Am I the Asshole?


TL;DR I got some dude next to me busted for cheating and his consequences were probably really bad

"AITA for not wanting to give a friend money?. Alright so here is some back story,  my husband and I have a mutual friend named Mike. We have known Mike since high school and are both very close to Mike. Mike is normally never the type to ask for help with anything, he is very much a ""I can handle it myself"" type of person. 

BUT, very shortly after high school he got his gf pregnant. They struggled to pay for the pregnancy alone but now that the baby is born it's even harder. He has been having issues keeping a job and so has she.  A few months ago he called my husband and I and asked to send him gas money because he couldn't even get to work.

A little while later we ended up sending a few hundred for some medical expenses. My parents still live near Mike and they heard about the money issues and put together a huge gift basket of baby stuff and $300 in cash. 

Since then Mike only gets in touch with us to ask for money. A few months back he asked for $200 for work boots which we said no to because we didn't have the money. But I'm a little offended that we were so close before and now he only calls to ask for money. I want to help but I also don't want him depending on my husband and I for money everytime he needs it.

A year later, he stops talking to me on Facebook and responding to texts so I text him that if he doesn't pay me the money he owes me in three months, that I'll take him to court. Sure enough, a few weeks later, he paid me.

The second time, I did some graphic design work for a friend for free since it was a simple thing but she wanted a lot more work done and I told her that since she wants so much done, I'd have to charge her and she agreed on a price per hour. I spend a month making the branding, website, and advertising for her home-based business. After the job was finished, I calculated everything and it was just shy of 5k but I dropped it down to around 4k since she was a friend. I give her the bill, she said she would have to wait a few weeks but she was happy with the results. Weeks go by and nothing, just kept telling me I would have to wait a bit longer. While all of this is going on, she's on Facebook talking about big trips her and her husband are going on, and showing pictures their new house being remodeled. A few months go by and she still wants me to do more work but I tell her that she needs to pay for what I've already done before I can do more. That's when she says that she decided that I would be a part owner of her business (she has no business experience or plan), and that I would get paid when the company makes money. I tell her that I would prefer the money since I was looking at returning to college and she flipped out, saying how I didn't believe in her and how I was a horrible friend; ending it by saying she was going to block me and that she would send me the money in a few weeks. I'm blocked, waiting for the money that never comes so I send a message to her company Facebook, her personal email, and a way to circumvent the text ban, all saying that if she doesn't pay me in two weeks, that I'd take her to court. Again, sure enough, I'm paid almost immediately. four years later, her company is still in the red.

TL;DR: Two former friends both owed me thousands of dollars and after waiting months, I had to threaten to sue them (even if I likely never would) to get it back, ending the friendship.

"AITA for not going to a gig with my friend after he bought us the tickets?. This is going to be a long one because I feel like I need to include a fair bit of detail to explain it so there'll be a TLDR at the end.

I (f20) and my friend (M20) (call him P) have been best friends for about 5 years, dated for over a year at the start of those 5 so we're super close. Last night me, P and a couple others went to another friend's house to smoke/drink and there was a guy there that we'd never really met before (call him D). D was the only one that didn't know everyone else there so I made a genuine effort to talk to him, but for the rest of the night he just responded with ""shut the fuck up"" to everything I said even if not to him (he did it to another girl that showed up so I basically think he just hates women generally) but my friend P was sort of joining in with D and was absolutely no way on my side, I felt like shit, I felt like I couldn't say anything because it would just get shot down, so I went to sleep early and have spent all day crying about it to my boyfriend. I just felt bullied and upset. My friend knew I was upset and said he'd apologise properly later when we go out.

Now right now I'm meant to be in a VIP line to see my friend P's favourite band, and then go to another club night with our shared favourite artist. He got us these tickets for my birthday, and I've not gone, and I feel really awful about it and I feel like I'm just overreacting, but he does things like this constantly, last night was not an exception. P gets far too drunk any time he has any and always needs looking after, he gets messy and too touchy and too loud all at once and is just generally difficult to deal with, he is a huge factor as to why I've stopped going clubbing so much because he's always there and always like this. Also when we're in any kind of social situation together he basically starts peacocking around trying to impress the other people we're with. Unfortunately his tactic for this is to take anything I say and make fun of me for it, I don't think he means to but he does and it upsets me. For example if I question something he  said he'll have a reaction along the lines of ""wtf that's not what I  said are you even listening? Are you stupid that's not what I said"" (generally his digs make 0 sense so it fully is just like he's saying it for the sake of it) Also anytime I mention me and my boyfriend he just instantly calls it gay or stupid, I called him out on it one time when he did it after me telling him we had reached 8 months together and we're celebrating. P apologized and then did it again in the same conversation when I next mentioned my boyfriend, he called him gay and brushed off what I'd said. I know it's only little stuff but it is genuinely every time we're with other people and again every time I mention my boyfriend. He's going through a tough time right now and I genuinely am the only person that's actively there for him, which makes me feel way worse for letting him down but also just upsets me more because I feel he doesn't even recognise that effort some times.

TLDR: My friend tends to take the piss out of me whenever we're in social situations and always takes the piss out of my relationship. (He is nice when it's just me and him) He was particularly upsetting last night so today I've cancelled going to a gig with him and he might have missed out on seeing two of his favourite artists in one night. I still don't know if he's actually gone or not.

"AITA for ignoring my alcoholic girlfriend when she is drunk?. My girlfriend gets drunk in our apartment almost every night. We have been together over 7 years but she has become an alcoholic in the last year.

She is a wonderful woman. The times we are together and she is sober are amazing. She is my favorite person in the world. But when she is drunk it feels like there's a stranger in my home trying to hug me and kiss me. I don't want that person anywhere near me.

My coping mechanism now is basically trying not to look at her, talk to her, or engage with her when she is drunk at home. I get frustrated and feel like I am dealing with an idiot when she is drunk.

Today for example, I came home from work at 4pm and she is drunk. I decide to take the dog for a walk to get out of the apartment. I tell her I am texting her that I'm going to walk the dog. I also write a note with the the time on it saying I am going to walk the dog. I placed it on the table in front of her. Five minutes after I leave she calls, worried, wondering where I am. I kept telling her and ended up snapping at her because she didn't understand where I was. I could hear her tearing up on the phone. 

After I came home, I realized I had 4 missed calls and a text wondering where I was. I was very annoyed. I put my headphones in to listen to music while she went into the bathroom and vomited (bulimia) because I don't like vomit. It gives me a lot of anxiety when she does that. After she came out she was crying and came over to get affection from me. I didn't give it back. She got up, crying, and walked to the bedroom, shutting the door behind her. I could hear her still crying. She isn't going to remember any of this tomorrow. I still feel like I am doing something wrong by not helping her in some way. But at the same time I feel like I don't know this tortured, crying woman in my apartment. I guess I am trying to ride this whole thing out. She got a therapist recently so I am hoping that will help. I have encouraged AA and she knows I still love her. I don't try to shame her about it when she is sober. Obviously she has a lot of problems and I sometimes feel like I am wrong for not being more helpful while she is drunk. But at the same time, it's like my anxiety and frustration paralyze me in the moment. AITA?

Edit:  Thank you all for the responses. She has had problems with bulimia since before I met her. She is 25, I am 26. I feel I have been trying to support her through mental health issues our entire relationship. I have my own problems which she had given me support for until she started drinking so heavily. I realized we can't be each other's therapist, though. I am planning on getting my own therapist to talk to this whole situation about. I am just not sure where to draw the line between supporting her and ensuring my own mental wellbeing. I do my best to be supportive but I have a lot of emotion limitations that I am looking to work on with a trained professional so I can be better for her as well.","NTA but I do think your emotions are a bit misplaced. Obviously if she's an alcoholic, bulimic,  and seeing a therapist there's some deep mental issues going on. You're not an asshole for not wanting to be around her but I feel like you should be more concerned with her mental state and try to talk to her about it and help her find ways to cope when she's sober because she's obviously going through some shit right now.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for being upset that my bf never pays for anything. Using throwaway. Before I start, I want to say that I am NOT the kind of person who expects a man to pay for everything. I have always liked things to be equal in a relationship so I would never make a man do everything in a relationship. If it matters, we’re both 20 and I’m a female.

Anyways, I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and in the entire 2 years that we’ve been together, I have been paying for almost everything including food and even sometimes stuff for him. I never had an issue with paying for food or even buying him stuff because I like to treat him. However, I noticed that he would never do the same for me. He never really offers to pay or buy me anything (not that I expect him to). When I try to compromise and say we can take turns paying for food, he always complains about being broke even though he makes way more money than I do and doesn’t spend money at all?? And when he does spend money, he always spends $100 or more which irritates me a bit because if he’s so broke then why is he spending so much money? And yes I have called him out on that many times before. 

So AITA? I feel so greedy when I think about this so I try to let it go but it keeps bothering me. Even when he suggests to eat out while I prefer to stay in, I still end up paying and it doesn’t make sense to me. And when he does pay, he always nags me about “owing” him when I have never once asked him to pay me back.","NTA - Just stop paying for stuff, then you'll see if he really thinks of you as an equal partner or a cash cow.

"AITA for wanting to do homework with my kids?. I have joint custody with my ex. They live with him Monday-Friday and go to school near his house. I live 45 minutes away. Over the course of 4 years, we have veered from the parenting plan and I have had the kids overnight during the week many times. It's never been an issue with him or the kids to have a 45 minute commute to school in the morning. In fact, we swing by the McDonald's drive-thru and they watch a movie while I drive. They're bright eyed and bushy tailed by the time we arrive at school. But, for the most part, they're with him during the week. 

My kids (8 and 10) are struggling in school. He doesn't enforce homework or practice reading with them. Their bedtime, on a school night, is around 10-11pm. Insane. My son's teacher has said he complains about being tired and mentioned she doesn't give him too much trouble about not turning in homework because she knows he doesn't have much support at home. My daughter is in 3rd grade and reads at a 1st grade level. Both kids need a lot of support in school and their dad is failing them. 

He asked me to take the kids for 2 weeks while he was on a road trip. It went fantastic. It was awesome to do homework with them, cook dinner for them, read with them, and put them to bed at a decent hour. This sparked me to ask him to agree to 50/50. Big mistake. He feels attacked and is flat our refusing me ANY weekday time now. One second he claims the commute is too hard on the kids, on the other hand he claims it's due to silly reasons I can only chalk up to being flat out vindictive. After a good couple months of not get along, he finally said he would agree to maybe 1 weekday. Great, that's a start! Now that we're approaching the start of school, he's claiming he said he would THINK about adding a day and he decided on no because I have been in talks with his family about his recent strange, controlling behavior. 

BTW, other shit has gone down with him like... Leaving the kids alone for hours. They come home from school to an empty house and have no idea when their dad will be home from work. He got a DUI in 2016 and has had multiple speeding tickets since. I also found out he was making my son ride in the back of his SUV (the trunk area) when his GF's kids are riding with him. Last year he was buying tramadol (synthetic opiate and controlled substance) online. My daughter called me begging me to pick her up because he and his girlfriend were fighting. Turns out, he broke his screen window and was throwing her clothes out whilst screaming obscenities at her (she is no peach either). His life is a shit show and I don't want my kids a part of it. 

Anyway, I'm retaining an attorney on Thursday and filing for full custody. He's going to lose it. I'm scared of his reaction. Am I overreacting? Am I the asshole?

"AITA for purposely ditching my friends?. I'm 17 Male and I hate them. I hate being around them and it's so draining putting up with them. I always do everything for them because I thought we were close. Yeah right. 

They begged me to have a sleepover. I did. But they were such assholes because I didn't have 2 spare beds. I had 2 sofa beds though. My parents made sure to buy so much stuff for the sleepover and made it into an event. They were so horrible to me throughout that day. 

I do everything for them. One time my friend shoe was destroyed and I bought him a new pair of Nikes for €80. I had my wallet with me. When we came back to the school after lunch everyone admired them and he told everyone he bought them with HIS money. I was in shock. 

They keep telling me I'll be a terrible doctor/programmer. My dream is to do medicine or Computer Science. I have the grades for them. My grades are absolutely fantastic because I study hard. They keep telling me that those courses would be terrible for me because I don't talk a lot and they tell me they highly doubt I'll be doing either of them 

These 2 drink as well which is fine but I don't drink. One time they told me to take a sip and I said I was fine but they pushed and pushed and then when I said no they went on a rant on how boring and nerdy I am literally for like 5min straight and I just stood there looking at them.

"AITA for not wanting a second date with a woman who lied about being trans?. Sorry about the wall of text.

Some background: I'm a 25 year old bisexual cisgender woman. I've been out for about 8 years now and have been actively involved in the local LGBTQIA+ community. While I've never been in a serious relationship with a trans person, I've had friendships and casual sexual encounters with both trans men and women before. Generally speaking, if you're attractive, healthy, in decent shape, and we get along well, I'm happy.

I have a profile on a popular dating app and a really pretty lesbian (we'll call her Claire) sent me a message last week. We hit it off well and when I was reading her profile, it said, ""Cisgender woman"" as her gender. She was definitely my type physically, and after we flirted, sent each other sexy pictures, etc. we set a date to see each other on Friday. Date went well, we had a fun night at a club, and then we went back to Claire's place. As we're walking back from the subway, we were talking dirty to each other and given some of the stuff I said, like I couldn't wait to taste her pussy, etc. it was pretty clear what my expectations were at this point. As we were getting naked, she unzips her dress and I see she's wearing pads on her hips, a waist cincher, and when she takes off her panties, she has a penis. I didn't care about any of that beyond the fact that this whole time I thought she was a cisgender lesbian and that she had never once mentioned that she was trans, even after what we were saying to each other on the walk back from the subway. I've never had a trans partner hide their transgender status from me before, and to be honest, I was hurt that she hadn't said anything earlier. She saw that I was surprised and goes, ""What? Something wrong?""

I stammered a bit because it was unexpected and said, ""N-no, I just didn't expect-"" and I could see her get REALLY mad. 

""What's wrong? You're obviously pissed! Spit it out! Are you one of those TERFs?!"" (trans-exclusionary radical feminist, basically a feminist who believes that transgender woman are just men and can never be a 'real' woman).

Obviously there was no salvaging the night at this point and said, ""No, I'm not, your profile said you're cis, so I wasn't expecting-"" and Claire screams at me that of course it says she's cis, she can't say she's trans for her own safety, that I don't understand what it's like being trans, that people have threatened to kill her, that she needed to know she could trust me before she said anything, that I was privileged because I can say I'm bi on a public dating profile and not risk someone wanting to kill me, etc. I tried to defend myself by saying that I didn't care about her being trans and that I was just surprised, and she accused me of lying, saying obviously I care a lot or I wouldn't have said anything, that I had been lying when I said I was excited to go down on her earlier that night, etc. After our fight, we're both upset, in tears, and she tells me to get dressed and get out.

The thing is, I know she's partially right: I'm not trans, I don't know what it's like to be trans, all the social issues that come with being trans etc. I also can't help but be upset that she never once bothered to tell me, even as we were walking to her apartment from the train station. I totally get not being up front about it with a stranger, but if we're going home together and you trust me enough to be alone with you in your apartment, why wouldn't you say it then? I felt like if she couldn't be up front with me about that, what else wasn't she up front with me about?

After the weekend, I log onto my dating app, and there was a message from Claire waiting for me. She said she's sorry, that she overreacted, should have said something, etc. and that she wanted a second date to make it up to me. The thing is, I wasn't interested anymore as I felt like I couldn't trust her. I declined, and she called me a transphobic piece of shit and blocked me on social media and we haven't spoken since. 

Questions that have been rattling in my brain the past couple days: Was it wrong for me to feel hurt for her not telling me her trans status before we went home to have sex? Am I being ignorant? Was I in the wrong for turning down another date after she apologized? Should I have given her a second chance? AITA in this?

**TL;DR Went on a date with a woman who said she was cis on her dating profile. She's transgender and I didn't know until we were getting naked at her apartment. We had a fight over it, she apologized a couple days later and asked for a second date, but I didn't think I could trust her anymore and declined.** ","Oh god you are so NOT the Asshole and I only read the first few paragraphs.

It's like a guy saying ""I'm excited to take it slow with you tonight"" and then getting home and stripping naked and saying ""well if you actually loved me you'd be willing to fuck me!!""

About 30 or so minutes he sent me a meme with that guy overstepping 3 step on a stair case and had them labeled with the ""steps of a realtionship"" with the guy's last foot landing on ""deciding the love of my life"". He did this in trying to make fun of my realtionship again.

"AITA for staying friends with my sisters ex?. Apologies for spelling mistakes and formatting errors. I’m on my phone and just want to get this out. 

My sister (F21) recently went through a breakup with her boyfriend (M24) of two years a few months ago. 

During their relationship, he would often come over for dinner and to play boardgames with my family. Him and I (F17) got along well during those times, as we had a similar sense of humor and aspirations.

My sister was aware of our friendship (though that felt too strong of a word for me) and when they broke up, she told me without provocation that she was fine with us remaining friends. 

Around this time I had gotten a job in the city at a restaurant, working full time as a waitress. I graduated earlier than my peers so I’ve just been saving up to go to college next year. After their breakup, her ex started talking to me a lot more. My sister was aware of this and once again, ok. They were on friendly terms. 

Then things took a turn, and I guess their friendly terms came to an end. She still insisted that it was ok that we were friends tho so things went on.

It got a little strange for me when her ex would start to be in the area that I worked in and would pop by during my break or after my shift and would hang out or drive me home. I felt wrong that we were hanging out, and had a gut feeling that my sister wouldn’t like it. I also started to feel guilty, despite it just being a friendship. 

In all honesty, I didn’t really put much importance on our friendship. I just felt a little strange being around him, especially due to our age gap. He didn’t seem put off by that though, and even considered me a good friend.

My sister started asking me every time I came home from work where I had been. She never took an interest in my day before so I knew why she was really asking. I had such a strong gut feeling that she wasn’t telling the truth about being ok, but I ignored it because she consistently told me it was fine. 

About a month after their breakup, my sisters ex picked me up from work. When we got to my home I was in the middle of ranting about one of my coworkers, so we sat out front so i could finish my story. During this, my sister I guess saw his car and came running from outside, crying and shouting things, like she knew it (that we were seeing each other). 

I decided it wasn't worth being his friend. It wasn't very important to me anyway and it was hurting my sister. 

When I told my sister my choice later that night, she begged me not to. She was crying but my decision was final. I found out the reason she was so dead-set on us remaining friends was because he had told her that if she ruined our friendship, he would never forgive her. 

I guess I'm asking because I still feel guilty, despite being reassured. I had a gut feeling and I know my sister, but I ignored it instead and listened to what she told me. This whole situation left me feeling just gross.","NTA.

I know she moved up here thinking we would have plenty of sibling bonding time, but that hasn’t turned out to be the case. 
We are both ok with her spending the holiday with us, but we don’t want her to bring her emotional support dog.  There was a situation when they first moved here where we dog sat for a week. The dog pissed on EVERYTHING no matter how much we walked it. It barked constantly at my dog and terrorized my cats.

She has since had the dog certified as an ESA. I assume (hope really) it’s had some sort of training because she takes it to work with her in an office. But I don’t want to be wrong.

"AITA for being reluctant about going to visit terminally ill NMom again after she talked multiple times about not welcoming me back in her house and disowning me?. To sum up, my narcissist mother has said to me many times that I'm not the daughter she wanted for various reasons, and has made her life really 'suck' as opposed to all her friends 'perfect lives and even more perfect offspring' (She said the latter out loud on my wedding day.) Several times, she told me she wished she never had me, and then refused to apologise but blamed me for being 'over-sensitive', before justifying what she said with the reason that 'mothers have the right to say anything to their offspring because the latter should know mothers love them unconditionally.'

Two years ago she was diagnosed with cancer and has undergone several operations and multiple rounds of treatment, which has worsened her mental condition. I live 5 hours away from home and work in a very busy academic environment, but have travelled back every 1/2 months or so to help my father take care of her. My husband has sometimes travelled with me - last summer, we cancelled our vacation to see her when she was having surgery.

However, in the last few months she has told me several times that she hates me and is sick of me, and that I am like a disease to her, and I wasn't welcome back in her home anymore. (She has threatened to beat my dad if he allowed me back in her house against her wishes.) One time my husband wanted to talk to her to make her feel better, only for her to say that she didn't want to see mine or my husband's 'ugly faces' and proceeding to insult my husband. (My father and I both made her write an apology to my husband for this btw.) She has also called me at work several times and then exploded at me for being 'egocentric'  just because someone at work had the nerve to hand me a document and divert my attention for a few seconds whilst she was talking.

As a result I am very uncomfortable around her, and really didn't want to go home to see her anymore for the near future, as her house no longer feels like a 'home' to me. Some of the immensely bitter things she has said to me since Christmas (which we spent with her for a week) have made my blood boil and even on some instances caused a sharp pain in my heart. When I gently communicated this to my mother she exploded and accused us of cutting her off in her hour of need. She then called me out for being 'over-sensitive', for hurting her by 'doubting her maternal love for me' and accused me of not caring about her as she was ill and therefore *was entitled to all the above behaviour due to her condition.* (My father of course did not agree with her and told me he understood that some of the words she said had gone too far.)

Sorry for such a long post, but I cannot help how I feel: I know my mother is in a critical condition and although I will never EVER cut her off/properly go NC, I cannot bring myself to keep going back to someone who keeps pushing me away, since it's taking a toll on my mental health and causing me quite some emotional strain. Even if she is my mother. Thanks for letting me vent.","NTA  

You have been mentally abused by a very long time. I encourage you to explore therapy if you have not already.  

I grew up with a narcissistic mother and over time went from full contact to low to very low to no contact. She too got cancer and I struggled with maintaining no contact and a sense of guilt. She passed last summer and I’ve come to realize there is nothing I could have done that would have made her love me the way a child needs, she would have never apologized, I would never have been good enough for her.

"AITA for being ""rude""?. Quick information. Very minor compared to everything else here. Friend messages me about an hour before I wake up, sends in about 4-5 messages along the lines of ""respond pls, pls respond"" Usually when called out for it, he says ""its just a joke"".

Just to provide info, I dont have read receipts one. People cant tell if I have read their message, but they can tell so on group chats

I wake up, head for the group chat to see what he's typed out earlier, then close it and try to head out onto my routine, planning on dealing with his 6 direct messages to me later.

&#x200B;

I barely close the phone when Im blasted with 6 messages to the face saying ""HEY UR ONLINE AND READ MY GROUP MESSAGE BUT NOT MINE"" ""RESPND PLS PLS""  ""Y DO YOU IGNORE ME!?!?"" and some ironic angry emojis here. It ticked me off a little, so I came back 20 min after breakfast and told him these words "" OMG Man, chill the heck out!"" and  proceed to answer his question earlier.

&#x200B;

He replies 15 min later, claiming I was very rude to him with some crying emojis here and there, and proceeds to call me an idiot( logic much??)

&#x200B;

Before I can even explain myself, he proceeds to block me, and without my knowledge sends over our chat convo to a mutual friend, whom he regards as inferior and complains whenever that friend doesn't walk with him to the bus, or talks with his other friends. He also once asked me to isolate myself from that mutual friend until he apologizes to us for ""leaving him"".

&#x200B;

I only learn this when I call the mutual friend later, who, has a weird case of Stockholm syndrome ( much like myself, truth be told), and keeps coming back to him, even if he regards him as inferior

&#x200B;

The mutual friends says that he saw the chat logs and told me that I was rude and should've just told ""Chill bro"" or ""Ok dude wait"" and said that he does the same to him and its just ""joke stuff"". When I asked him why he said I was rude and called me an idiot, he retorted with the same statement , asking why I was 'rude' to him in the first place and that I should call him and apologize.

At first I didn’t mind driving the around but now almost everyone in my friend group has a license. 

Except one. Don’t get me wrong I LOVE this girl to death and love being her friend but having to drive her home is getting to be a burden to all of my friends.

"WIBTA If I stopped talking to a 14 year old after she refused to reconsider a costume?. To start this off, I want to point out that Im half Native American. I wasnt raised on a reaervation but I reconnected with my tribe a few years ago and its sad to say that Im one of the richest people who regularly visits the tribe with only $2K in my savings. Ive seen the poverty, Ive donated as much as I feasably can to my tribe without compromising my own lifestyle, and it eats me up inside knowing that I'm fortunate enough to not be stuck there like some of them are. 

I also want to say I'm not asking if I'm an asshole for requesting a 14 year old to reconsider her costume. I'm asking if I'm an asshole for responding to her rejection of my request.

Anyway, onto the post. A friend of mine posted on FB a day or so ago looking for some used Halloween costumes for her kids, a perfectly reasonable thing to do. That's when I discovered that her 14 year old wanted to go as an ""Indian princess"", and having seen the poverty in my own tribe, I was very deeply offended. I talked to my friend, who basically shrugged me off and said to talk to her 14 year old, so I did. I explained that the costume was damaging to real Native Americans and would only add to an already horrifically oppressed group of people but she also shrugged me off. I continued and told her everything about what I'd seen in my tribe (she knows I'm half) and did kinda go on a tangent/semi-hysterical rant about how its cruel and selfish for her to wear a costume that was derogatory to half of my ancestry and the people that settled this land before her. She told me that it ""didnt matter now"" and she wasnt the only one doing it so what did it matter. 

I told her that if she went through with wearing the costume, I would cease to let her use my old sports equipment and I would not talk to her any longer because I wasnt the only one talking to her so what did it matter.

"AITA for calling bullshit on my friend getting strep from drinking tap water?. I have a friend that is overly sweet, generous, and eccentric. Honestly in many regards a wonderful human being. 

However. They claim to be deathly allergic to shellfish, strawberries, eggs and others. They also worry about a million other bad things happening. 

“Eww don’t sit in that massage chair, there’s so many bacteria and that’s how you get lice.” 

“Eww I cant believe you and your roommate’s just share leftovers or try each other’s drinks”. 

Overall kind of a worry wart and in my unprofessional opinion a bit of a hypochondriac. 

Anyways, the latest one is that they won’t drink non bottled water because drinking tap water gives them strep throat. Mind you this is wonderful tasting Alaskan tap, not some contaminated Flint water. 

Now if you don’t know, strep throat is caused by a Streptococcus bacterial infection. 

So we’re with my brother sunbathing in a park near my house in Alaska record breaking 90 degree heat, and my brother makes a trip to the house to get water because we forgot to bring any. 

When my brother returns with only reusable water bottles filled with ice and tap water, my friend reiterates the whole “strep from tap water” story. 

I explained that that isn’t how bacteria work. One person can’t just be getting a bacterial infection from water that everybody else drinks and is just fine. 

So we all drink the water, friend included. 

Now two weeks later, my brother, my friend, and now finally me all have gotten sore throat kinds of sick. I wholeheartedly believe to be unrelated to tap water, and more to do with how disease spreads.

"WIBTA for making a video compilation of my brother verbally abusing my mom and then show it to his social worker?.  

I've recently returned from college and my younger brother (20) appears to be in a bad mental state. For years he has verbally abused my mom who he lives with. I can assure you, my mom is a very sweet lady but a hell of a pushover. She takes his shit because she thinks he can't live on his own. He constantly nags her, telling her that she is mentally retarded and the stupidest person ever (every day). Thus, she should listen to everything he says and never question him or give him any sort of advice. Almost every day he yells at her and calls her every name in the book including the C word. Some things that get him going include asking him to do something and not agreeing with him immediately. Sometimes he snaps her wooden spoons to 'teach her a lesson'. He's his worst when he's drunk because he gets very angry and rants about nonsense.

In addition, he is a complete slob which forces my mom and I to constantly clean up after him. He sits on the couch and has our mom get him things while he watches TV. He's never done the dishes. I do them because they need to get done but it burns my soul knowing that most of them are his. He's never walked the dogs either. He goes on long rants to me about how he ""figures everything out on his own"" without looking it up because he is that smart. However I had to help him order a phone case because he couldn't figure it.

I've tried to reason with him many times that the way he talks to us is BS but he just deflects it or uses the excuse that our mom is dumb so therefore the only way to 'teach' her is to yell at hers (he isn't, she is perfectly normal). He has told me that his yelling is normal and necessary. Anytime I tell him that what he is doing is fucked up he gets defense and proceeds to call me a bitch and he says things like ""fuck your opinion, I don't give a fuck"" or just simple ""stfu"".

This is every single day since I've been back (which is over a month). I've given up trying to talk to him so I just try to avoid him when I'm not recording him. I'm extremely relieved whenever he leaves the house to buy bowls or something. He's my brother but I'm beyond done and am moving out in 2 weeks. I just feel bad for my mom who seems to be stuck. He does help pay some rent, but I don't think the abuse is worth it for her.

So I've been recording his outbursts for a while because I don't know what else to do. I then got the idea to show it to my brother's social worker. He has a social worker because of a crime he committed when he was 17. His social worker should know what is going on and this way my brother can't deny anything.

My only hesitation is that he is obviously not well in the head, so I don't know what this video would do to him. I definitely don't want him to do anything drastic. However I have dozens of videos and just listening to one of them disgusts me and gives me inspiration to go ahead and make the compilation.

"AITA for telling a grieving friend she reaps what she sows. So I’m not sure if you’ve heard but on twitter, when someone dies usually the weirdos on the Kpop fandom side will post “maybe if [person who died] stanned (Stan is a term for being a fan of) [insert K-pop singer], they would have lived.” For instance, when Cameron Boyce passed away a girl I’m kinda friends with said “Maybe if Cameron had bought this album, he wouldn’t have died” it’s sick and gross and I hate her for it and that feeling has never quite gone away. 

This includes celebrities she doesn’t even know. For example, Peter Fonda died and she spammed the Rip tag with “Maybe if Peter Fonda stanned BTS, he wouldn’t have died” and she posted a video of BTS dancing. She’s 17 but acts like a goddamn toddler.

Today, the Kpop celebrity her entire account is based on died. Now, people from all over are spamming the rip tag with “Maybe if [my friend’s favorite kpop girl] stanned [some random singer, football player, whatever etc] she wouldn’t have died” which is also just as cruel, but she also did the exact same thing to everybody else. 

My friend comes to me asking if I could defend the girl that passed away on those posts, but I told her “no. It sucks but You reap what you sow, you did the same shit.” now she’s calling me out and saying I’m an asshole but she does this everytime. It’s funny to her when someone else dies but when her fave does and people don’t care, she’s suddenly at a loss.

Edit - I said I’m “kinda” friends with her because I’ve been trying to distance myself after she showed her true colors but she’s also in a group chat I’m in so it would be hard without separating the whole group.

"AITA? Cousin Won't Go Out Of Her Way For Dying Relative. This story involves three cousins. Two first cousins who are nearing their 60's and a second cousin in her 70's. One of the first cousins has been morbidly obese all of her life and has issues with mobility now, but is able to commute and work an office job. The other first cousin is her sister and does not play a huge role in this story other than being a loving sister of a similar mindset. The final cousin is a lovely, caring woman who has stage four cancer and is undergoing chemo.

Here's where I **am** the asshole: in this story, I shall refer to them as: Fat Cousin, Sister Cousin, and Cancer Cousin. Callous, but descriptive.

FC lives 30 minutes away. For many years I've helped her whenever I can. For example, I'll shop for her if I'm in the area. Earlier this year, I rearranged a vacation to be able to drive a U-Haul 6 hours across state for her.

FC hasn't seen CC in at least five years, despite me offering (a couple times each year) to arrange a visit and take her on the 30 minute drive. CC wants to see FC, but FC is always ""overwhelmed"". While FC's mobility is limited, she takes multiple 3 and 6 hour drives every year for holidays and family vacations, so a 30 minute drive is not an insurmountable feat.

SC emailed to invite me along to an all-day brunch with some longtime friends of theirs 2 hours away. I really don't know these people, last having met them probably 10 years ago. I'm not a social butterfly, and would not have been at least initially comfortable in a group of strangers, but I thought it would be good to catch up with the two cousins who I hadn't seen in months at that point, so I agreed to go.

The plan was to meet at FC's place. SC would drive us up to their friend's, leaving at 10am for the 2 hour drive. I asked that we take a 10 minute detour along the way so I could deliver holiday cookies to CC. I simultaneously told CC about this idea, but warned her that we wouldn't be able to stay and visit as we would be on our way to the brunch. CC said that she really wanted to see the other two, and would put on a coat to meet us at the car and pick up the cookies.

I heard back from SC. She said she didn't think there would be enough time for a visit with CC, and passed it off to FC who said no. I replied to clarify that this was literally only 10 minutes on top of the 2 hour drive, and that CC understood we couldn't stay to visit and would come to the car.

FC replied with a long email to reiterate that she is overwhelmed and can't add a stop to the already full day. She offered the alternative that I deliver the cookies to CC on my own, then backtrack another 30 minutes to FC's place, where they would wait for me, but we had to leave by 11am. (What happened to 10am?). So, I pulled out of the brunch plans.

So, AITA for being disappointed in them and backing out on brunch?

"AITA for not wanting my fiance to be friends with this girl. So my boyfriend and I just got engaged, we been together over a year, live together, and have a dog together. We are very happy, but we have one issue in our relationship. He has a friend who hes been friends with since high school and shes a she. 

I'm not upset she is a girl. But he was in love with her for years until I came into the pictures, they have never slept together, but have made out on several drunken nights. He says he is not in love with her anymore, and she always turned down his efforts to form a relationship with her in the past. But since we have been together, she has consistently shared things on social media about him. Pictures of them kissing each others cheeks, swimming together, and laying down together. They look really happy in their pics. He never really takes pictures with me, but they have millions. And she always shares them with some love quote, hearts, and recently a post stating that if they were single when they were 30 they would get married. 

In the first few months of our relationship,  she was ok with me in person but in several group chats with her and his friends has said mean stuff about me not belonging there, or just negative in general. He never replied or stood up for me, and when I got upset all his other friends got mad at me. When I asked why he didnt stand up for me he said it was because he didnt want his other friends being mad at him. This girl (who when she isnt around, all his friends and him dont even refer to her as a friend, calling her a ho and saying she is attention seeking) doesnt seem to care we are in a committed relationship. When my bf finally confronted her about stuff, she finally backed off, but I still dont really trust her. 

She invites just him to stuff, and later will say ""your gf can come too!"" if he brings me up. But it feels a bit like now that my fiance isnt trying to get in her pants constantly she missed that attention. So now shes trying to get it back.

Whenever I ask why he is still friends with her when she publicly says stuff about me or when she post stuff about him and he doesnt say anything he always gives different excuses. Making it feel like shes more important to him than our relationship is. 

Whenever she is brought up we fight. He doesnt see my problem with her. He thinks I'm being childish. But I know how she is, because I used to be like her. She is attention seeking and I dont want him alone with her because of what she might do. He even wants her to come to our wedding, which makes me uncomfortable.

"AITA for not wanting my aunt or my mother in my life anymore (21 F). I am a few weeks into my junior year in college when I recently realized thaf I haven't spoken to my mother in almost 2 years and my aunt in almost 5 or 6 years. 
Okay....so my aunt is a begger. Everyone in the family knows that. She can barely keep a job (I think. I've never seen her in work close the entire time I knew her), She steals, she lies, and she was just a bad example when I was younger. Now I understand people talk about blood is thicker than water but I don't care. Even if you're family, If you fuck me over or play me, I will cut ties. Multiple incidents occured when my aunt decided to visit on many occasions. One I vividly remember is the day my dad came home angry. I was in high school so lets say like 15 or 16. I asked him what had happened. Apparently my aunt asked my mother for the pin to the EBT card because she wanted just a little food. My mother gave it to her. Not surprising to me she spent pretty much like $200 or more on groceries even though she just wanted a few things. My dad was pissed and so was my mother. My aunts response: You should have never given me the pin. 
Wtf? 
She gave you the pin because you asked to get A LITTLE food. Not feed you for the next month or two while we haven't even gone grocery shopping yet. The next incident was a couple weeks before me and my dad moved. I love animals. At the time I had a cat that I named Noah. He was the love of my life and everyone knew that. Now I dont remember what started the little argument. There was no yelling. I remember having an attitude because of something she said and I WALKED AWAY FROM HER. I wasn't in the mood to argue. Then she came up to my dads room where I was sitting and said: ""blah blah blah. You need to get over it. You ain't gonna have your cat for long anyways so say goodbye"".
I fucking snapped and I told her off and made her cry. I didn't care. I knew I probably would be able to bring him and I was already upset about it. Now you want to make me feel worse. That ain't gonna happen. I would also like to add that one day she let him outside and I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN! I didn't get to say goodbye auntie. When we finally left, I didn't say goodbye to her and I haven't spoken to her since.
This is getting long but I am going to keep going.
Now my mother. She...is okay. I mean if I had a choice I would obviously choose my dad over my mother. She wasn't really there for me. She drinks until she passes out. She also can't hold down a job or an apartment. She never has her own money and when she borrows, she pretty much never pays it back. She goes to jail more than anyone I have ever known. She does and sells drugs, another reason she ends up in jail. She choose horrible boyfriends. I've had much more fond memories of my father taking care of me when I was sick, coming to my rotc competitions, getting me my first pet, helping me with prom, college, drivers test, etc. When I think of my mother, I can remember the times she obviously took my money without asking, her drunk, her making a scene on a bus for literally no reason, asking for money, yelling, and more. I should love my mother but I can't say i do. I mean she can say I love you and kiss me but I remember always just saying I love her back and then wiping my cheek when she wasn't looking. She always ended up disappointing me in one way or another. Not coming to my high school graduation, getting put in jail the day before my archery competition, just not showing up period. It gets tiresome. Now she is in jail. We haven't spoken in a couple of years. I really don't want to speak with her. I know she is going to just end up in jail again as she always does and I am just left here with people asking me ""How is your mom doing?""

A lot of us have sensory sensitivity problems, so she may actually be fairly understanding about it if you did get a chance to talk to her. 

*information requested, OP delivered.*

Are you literally ignoring her, as in when she speaks you act like she's not there? Or are you just avoiding her company but responding if anything comes up in class?

"AITA for getting married in a private ceremony with no friends or family?. Husband and I (Female) got engaged in July of this year. We live together and own a home together. After a few weeks of half-assed wedding planning, we decided we would rather just have an intimate private ceremony with just the two of us on a beach vacation we had already planned. We hate attention and we're also really frugal, so combining the wedding and honeymoon seemed like a great option.

Some context: My Mother in Law has always been a somewhat dramatic presence in our lives. She had an inappropriate codependent relationship with Husband when he was a kid, but since he's been an adult he's worked hard on setting healthy boundaries while still trying to be a good son. It's taken a lot of therapy and has been a constant effort for him (and me, since I started dating him) to maintain these boundaries, but we do a pretty good job of managing things without caving in to her demands or letting her stress us out. Husband does most of the decision-making in communicating with her when the drama strikes, I try to stay out of it and just be pleasant and kind and patient whenever it's going on. For the past few months we thought things were going well with her and there has been very little drama. Hanging out with her has been, for the most part, fun and pleasant with no major breakdowns or guilt trips. We genuinely make an effort to have a relationship with her -- we take her out to meals, we help her with things around her house, we invite her to celebrate holidays with us, we text and call her, we remember her birthday and get her gifts, etc. We also see her a lot more than my side of the family, since my family lives in another state. We love her, but I expect the relationship will always be fraught. She is estranged from almost everyone in her family, so we always have to be careful not to invite any of Husband's aunts/uncles or grandparents to events where she will also be present.

So, back to our decision to ""elope"", or basically just have a private wedding ceremony. We told our parents about our desires, and they expressed some sadness and disappointment but were ultimately supportive and understood our reasoning. MIL had sort of a crying tantrum and we did kind of start to reconsider our plans but then a few days later she gave us her support so we decided to go ahead. Things went totally back to normal, we hung out with her a few times and it was fine, no hints of guilting or anything like that. They wanted to host a small lunch party when we got back where we could celebrate with family and friends, and we agreed and helped with the planning of that party.

More context: we are quite young (late 20s) but I have actually been married and divorced before (kind of a different story, but basically I married very young for religious reasons to a person who ended up being fairly controlling, I was immature and didn't know how to deal with it, we divorced very quickly).

So finally, two weeks ago, our trip came around. I wore an $80 white dress from an online boutique, he wore a suit he already owned. We had a bouquet, boutonniere, an officiant, and a photographer. We exchanged super personal, intimate vows by the ocean at sunset, laughed and cried, toasted with champagne, ate cake. We finished the night with an amazing dinner and then lounged in the pool at a resort, being served tropical drinks all night and talking about our future. It was beautiful and relaxing and special and CHEAP.

The day after our ceremony, we sent our parents some selfies in our wedding attire with a message that said some stuff about how happy we were and that we love them. They responded with congratulations and standard heart emojis.

About a week after we returned from our vacation, after making phone calls and announcing to close family and friends, we decided to announce that we were married on social media. We posted a photo in our wedding attire with a caption announcing that we got married in a private ceremony while we were on vacation. We got lots of congratulations and positivity and support from our friends and family. We also sent out the invitations for the lunch party we had planned for later this month. (To clarify, this is NOT a ""gift grab"" party, the invites say ""bring just your company and your appetite"", it's just to catch up with everyone and celebrate the occasion.)

So here's where things get interesting. A week after returning from our trip, MIL started texting me about how she has been an emotional wreck ever since seeing our wedding picture, she's been sobbing uncontrollably, she doesn't understand why we hate her so much that we purposely excluded her from our day, she doesn't know if she can even do our lunch party (she was supposed to host it at her house), all her friends think it's ""horrifying"" that we had a wedding and didn't invite her, etc. Her life has been so hard (she listed a bunch of stuff that has gone wrong in her life) and she doesn't have anything and anyone and she worked so hard to raise Husband etc, and basically being at our wedding is the one thing she could have had in her life. She also made a comment about how of course \_my\_ parents didn't care because it was my second wedding, but for her she would have only seen her son get married once (very rude imo, this is already a sensitive subject for me). I kept it together pretty well but the conversation got a little out of hand and it stressed me out, I basically lost a whole day of productivity at work worrying about it.

I'm feeling a lot of different things. Part of me feels guilty, like I betrayed family and broke the heart of my emotionally fragile MIL. Part of me just feels bewildered, I wasn't expecting this severe reaction. Part of me wants to justify and defend our decision to ""elope"", but I know that isn't going to be productive. Part of me is just super annoyed that she is causing drama once again, as usual, and that this is a great example of one of the reasons we wanted a private wedding in the first place. Part of me is pissed and offended, especially that she took a small jab at me for being a second-time bride. 

I totally get that as a parent, not being present at a child's wedding is tough. Eloping is a selfish thing to do. People are absolutely entitled to feel however they feel about it. We really tried to be kind about it and keep our families in the loop with our desires the whole time, and explain our reasons for wanting a private destination ceremony, before pulling the trigger. I totally get that when you do stuff like this, you have to be willing to deal with whatever reaction you get. I guess I just wasn't expecting it to be this dramatic. I know it will all blow over and things will go back to normal as it always does after the drama with her, but I guess I just want to get an objective opinion: am I the asshole here?","NTA.  She gave her blessing before the ceremony.  This seems like classic narcissistic behavior.  On another note, eloping is not selfish.  This was YOUR DAY to do however you pleased.  Try not to let her get you (or your husband) down.  CONGRATULATIONS on your marriage and good luck with your MIL.  I have a feeling this won't be the last time you're forced to have an exchange like this.

"WIBTA If I recommend therapy to my adult daughter for her regressive behaviors?. My daughter is a 20 year old young woman, and over the past few years, she has developed regressive behaviors, and I’m not sure where they came from. As a child she was very independent, driven, and self motivated. She was very much the kid that always went “I can do it myself” when an adult tried to help her with something. When she became a teenager, about 16, she started acting like a young child. She became very dependent, which was unlike her, and very childlike. Her mother and I didn’t know what caused the sudden change in personality, but we let it go, figuring that she would grow out of it eventually. 

She’s going to be 21 early next year, and she still hasn’t grown out of these behaviors. She whines like a child when she doesn’t get her way, sort of like a “wahhh” sound. She also will cross her arms and stomp her foot on the ground when something upsets her. Other behaviors include her (purposely) sloppily eating her food, leaving the crust off her sandwich, acts helpless as if needs to have everything done for (including her college assignments). This is all very bizarre to me as it happened very suddenly and is completely unlike the child she was before she was about 16 or 17. Her mother and I have talked to her about this but she will mock/mimic us, just like a child. Other times we both have separately tried to talk to her about this in private but to no avail. She will bury her face into her pillow and act like we’re not speaking to her. 

We’re thinking of recommending therapy. We can’t force her to go, as she is an adult, but we at least want her to recognize that that’s how serious we think these behaviors are. However, I am fearful of how she would react, and whether or not it might make the situation worse. WIBTA?",NTA - sounds like something happened to her that she refuses to acknowledge.

"AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend. Bit of a backstory, she took a kitten home that was abandoned in a field and we both have been nursing it and trying to bring it back to live.

"AITA for limiting my son's YouTube time and causing huge tantrums and family drama?. A little background: I'm 33, my kids mother is 35, my son is 3 and he'll be 4 in July.  We barely even knew each other when she got pregnant.  She was a hook up.  It was irresponsible and I regret it but I love my son.  

I've been pretty distant off and on since his birth because we can't manage to get along.  Lately I've made a huge attempt to get my life straight and the result is I get to stay at her apartment on my days off just to spend time with him.  I do work around her house and we watch movies together.  Things are actually going really well.  

For the last three months I've been keeping my mouth shut so as to not start fights.  Last year she decided to punish me by skipping every holiday.  Around Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, she refused to pick up her phone.  Starting in January I pretended it didn't happen and we ""started over"".  

So here's the problem: all he ever wants to do is watch YouTube.  And she let's him.  It is literally his babysitter.  I waited a long time to do anything about it but it has just gotten worse.  I wanted to avoid the argument.  I want to see him on his birthday.  But I have finally had enough.  He woke up from a nap the other day and immediately picked up her phone.  I said it was enough and took it away.  Que the screaming tantrum.  She said ""just give it to him I have a headache and I have homework"".  I put my foot down and said he needs social interaction and exercise.  She comes back with ""he gets both of those at school. He is student of the month, has the highest grades in his class, and if he wants YouTube he can have it, besides, I limit him to 3 hours a day"".  I was at a loss for words.  Three.  Fucking.  Hours.  Around this time her father walks in and wants to know why my son is freaking out and we're arguing.  I explained that I took the phone away and why and he actually agreed with me.  He even admitted that he was guilty of it, too.  I stole a glance at his mother and she was giving me the shittiest death glare I've ever seen.  Now she's punishing her father by limiting his time with my son and she's been speaking to him like he's retarded.  He and I both know why.  So now my son gets out of school at 3pm.  Watches YouTube for an hour or two, takes a nap, does it again, then goes to bed.  Once in a while he'll play with toys or ask to go to the playground.  I have started taking the phone away.  Every single time he kicks and screams and throws himself on the ground.  He's even said ""daddy isn't my friend anymore"" which I laughed about and said I love you anyway but honestly it fucking hurt.  

So now I'm back in the doghouse, the father is suffering for it, and my son doesn't even like spending time with me.  

Should I just let him enjoy his cartoons?  Am I going overboard with parenting when I haven't really been in the picture?  Am I the asshole?","NTA! Children need human interaction!

"WIBTA if I deny a schoolmate a job?. Okay, the title sounds bad but hear me out. 

Next to my school is a new company, and in this company you basically do an apprenticeship.

Most of my coworkers are also struggling. But one left and went off to college early. 

This schoolmate, we'll call him ""Rick"" is in my dual enrollment class currently and he... Isn't doing so well. He's honestly struggling and I even tutored him a couple of times and he doesn't think he can handle it. 

Today, Rick somehow brought up the topic of where I work and I told him. He then asks to set him up a job where I work. 

But the reasons why I want to lie and say that ""oh, they declined"" or something along those lines is: 

1. Rick can't handle the classes he already has. I don't want him to go into this and be stuck doing it. He also has after school activities that would make it so if he WERE to get the job, he'd have to catch up on a lot. 

2. My sister is also pending a response on if she wants to work here. And she asked first. So I'm not sure if I'd be fair to her if I somehow brought him up out of the blue and he possibly steals her spot, unprepared. 

3. I'm bad at decisions and I honestly didn't ask for this. This isn't a casual job like McDonald's. There is a lot of pressure and I don't want to make Rick unhappy and knowingly put him in a situation that he can't handle nor give my boss at Nox another ""dud"" (multiple people quit for low work effort or lack thereof. I don't want to contribute to that problem, which is why my boss is selective on finding a worker already)

I'm just not sure what to do. I don't think he'll take it lightly if I straight up tell him he's ""not qualified"" or if I send him onto thin ice knowing he'll fall through. I also don't want to anger my sister.

"AITA for not forgiving my boy best friend?. So me and my friend have been best friends for almost a year. When i had moved schools, he welcomed me into his friendship group and i got along with everyone and i hung out with them every day. Me and him especially clicked and we got super close.

Fast forward a couple of months and around October time his attitude started to change. He’d become quite rude and often mean and he made a large number of ‘jokes’ (somewhat inappropriate). He’d gotten quite obsessive at this point and often made me feel uncomfortable, although i laughed it all off as i thought i was just being sensitive.

Over the Christmas break, he suddenly stopped texting me, stopped meeting up, ignoring all my messages and avoiding me at school. For 2 weeks we had no contact and i was confused at what i had done.

Then one day he text me out of no where and pretended nothing had happened and so we started texting again. I have this Muslim best friend and one day i have brought her up. He started making extremely racial jokes about her religion and wouldn’t listen to me when i told him to stop because it was vile.

After that i had become very angry with him as it wasn’t the first time i felt hurt/uncomfortable with the topics or jokes he was making. I told him to stop messaging me as i didn’t want his negativity and rudeness in my life. He got angry at me for that and didn’t understand.

He did actually apologise to me a couple of days later and i replied with ‘thank you for apologising’ and he seemed taken aback that i only thanked him and didn’t become his best friend again.

"AITA For removing a feral cat community?. Two months ago my girlfriend and our dog moved into a new apartment complex. We selected the unit that was adjacent to the dog park and were very excited about our new venture. On move in day we noticed a cat and food dish besides our stairs. I dismissed it thinking the cat belonged to a neighbor but our dog did not dismiss the knowledge of a cat outside.

That evening we went out for a walk to relax and the same cat was by our door. Two cats across the street and several under cars or on top of cars all checking out the new dog in the neighborhood. As we walked we noticed the same white styrofoam food dishes scattered around the buildings.

Fast forward: we learn there is a cat lady who does a great job caring for this quite large feral community. 

So why is it a problem. We can not keep a blind or curtain on any window longer than a day. There are approximately 6 cats within site of our windows and/or that sit on our balcony railing and the dog go bonkers all day and night long. He chases from 1 window to the next. 

We asked the lady the remove the dishes from our building and she did. They eat somewhere else and comeback here to rest and sleep. 

We started filing complaints in the office and some organization is trapping the cats after 3 months. There are an estimated 20 cats on property. I feel like the asshole but there has been little serenity in my home since we moved in. I also feel horrible for the people that loved the cats.

AITA","NTA- feral cats can cause alot of issues for wildlife and people. They can cause mass extinction of birds, rabbits, squirrels and other native wildlife causing ecological disruption. These cats aren't healthy either, they spread lice, rabies, worms and other parasites. It's very common for feral cats to fight each other so most of them have issues with infection and don't heal or suffer other kinds of painful death. It's inhumane to encourage unhealthy large populations of cats just because some people like to see them around. 

If people want to have cats they can do it on their own property, keep them healthy and happy just like you are expected to with your dog. 

All of that said, I think it's incredibly tragic how some of these large cat populations are handled. They don't deserve to be put down because of one cat lady's ignorance. Maybe try to get in touch with a feral cat sanctuary to see if they can capture them live, neuter, and give vaccines to these cats and let them live out the rest of there lives in a designated area where they aren't harming other wildlife.

"AITA for texting a girl my mate slept with once and doesn't like?. I tried to stick to the main points here but also didn’t want to cut parts out. Hopefully it’s at least an interesting little story for you to read.

My mate starts talking to this girl. He invites her round to his house with a few others and myself, we play a drinking game. During the night her and I actually vibe really well and my mate was kinda upset by some news he received earlier that weekend, so he wasn’t himself. Anyway, she stayed the night and they slept together. Cool.

That same night and the next day, my mate goes “she seems more interested in you” and he kept banging on about this point. I just said “you’re not yourself and she’s just friendly, don’t worry about it”.

Fast forward 2 weeks. They keep talking on and off but don’t see each other. Then she invites him to a small house party a couple nights ago. He was hanging with a few of us boys so we went along too.

Again, her and I get along really well and my mate and her hardly talk. All night my mate tells me “she’s definitely more interested in you, maybe you should just message her/go for her.” I brush it off again but as we leave, her and I found ourselves alone outside while waiting for the others.

Some comment I made ended with her saying “that’s nothing, you should come see my bedroom” and I’m like “did you just invite me to your room?” And she goes “yeah... I shouldn’t have said that but I feel like we get along well”. I’m like “yeah...” and it kinda just trailed off there as the others caught up to us.

We get in my car, she asks for my phone (I think to bring up maps to get us to someone’s house). As she gets out though, she turns to me and says “I put my number in your phone, message me sometime” without my mate hearing. I didn’t know what to say, so I’m like “yeah cool”.

Anyway, he text her as we were driving home and asked her straight up if she was more interested in me than in him. She implied she was. He said I should just go for it and message her. So I told my mate what she did earlier, with the bedroom invite and number. He was upset by this, not so much because he likes her (he admits he doesn’t), but because she made a decision before fully getting to know him (despite him also making almost no effort, which is because he’s upset right now but still, you reap what you sow).

And that brings us to my point. He text me saying that actually, I shouldn’t message her because he’s not comfortable with it. I did text her though and I am seeing her this week. My whole point is that I can take his discomfort into consideration but I won’t let his feelings drive my actions.

He’s annoyed at me about this, saying I’ve lost his trust and I’m ruining our friendship over her. This isn’t an ex-gf, just a girl he saw twice and barely conversed with except over text. Now he’s cracking the shits at me after telling me to go for her the whole time.

"AITA for closing a gate at the dog park?. I have a new puppy. She’s 5 months and she’s getting use to other dogs. I decided to take her to the dog park this morning to get her used to other dogs. Seeing how it’s really cold and a Sunday morning, I knew there wasn’t going to be a lot of dogs. I used to go to the dog park almost everyday when I had another dog so I got the hang of the schedule (sadly, he passed away). So this morning when I get to the dog park, there’s only 4 dogs (as expected). 

Just a little perspective of this dog park... it’s massive. It’s about 3-4 acres of land. It’s divided into 2 large dog areas where there’s a fence in between them and a gate you can close to make it 2 separate areas or open it to make it an entire area. Some people close it when there’s a lot of dogs or just close it if someone needs space... there’s another area for smaller dogs too... it’s really small compared to the large area. 

Anyways, we go and there’s only 4 dogs/owners. 1 chill poodle that was hanging out, 2 of the dogs were really aggressive so the owners had to leash them up. And 1 black dog that was fairly young. She seemed to be very excited and playful. Well, our dog goes in and she’s not terrified, but she’s hesitate. It’s not her first time so we’re still getting used to other dogs. This black dog keeps trying to playfully attack her though. The dog kept trying to bite our dogs legs and neck. It wasn’t friendly and the owner wasn’t saying or doing anything. So i decided to just move over to the other side of the large dog park area where no other dog was at... nobody was in there. I felt like my dog just needed a small break and I wanted to throw the ball around/ let her get use to the smells and whatever. So I take my dog to the other side and just close the gate behind me, thinking it wasn’t a big deal since 2 of the dogs are tied up, and the dogs were only hanging out on one side of the area.... but then that black dogs owner starts yelling that the gate needs to be open. We go back and forth and I’m basically yelling he’s an asshole. Nobody else chimes and he just opens the gate.

"AITA For not wanting to see my dad in two months when he gets out of prison?. Title says most of it.

My father has been in prison since I was barely a year old. My mother made an effort for me to have a relationship with him and I don’t totally hate him. I know he didn’t plan on leaving us but his shitty ideas caught up with him and he got arrested forcing him to leave my mom to take care of me on her own. My parents are since divorced but she still wants me to have him in my life, and frankly I’m not a fan of that idea. I got everywhere I am today through my own hard work and the loving support of my mom. He had nothing to do with it.

It’s been 19 years and he’s finally getting out, but I don’t want to see him. The last time I visited him was when I had barely turned 18 (just over 2 years ago) and it didn’t go too well because he told me going to college was selfish and would end up putting my mom in debt. I know I need to make amends with him and I will in time, but my mom wants me to be the one who picks him up when he gets out and take him to my uncles house where he will be staying. I told her I don’t want to do this as I’m not comfortable spending time with him by myself just yet, and she told me I owe it to him. I just don’t want to see him until I’m ready to forgive, and he hasn’t shown me why he’s deserving of it just yet.

"AITA for wanting to wear a suit to my parent's wedding?. My biological parents are finally getting married after being together for 28 years and having 2 kids. The wedding is pretty lowkey, basically a glorified piss up at the pub but there will be a semi formal ceremony in which my brother and I (19 F) are going to give our mum away. 

My mum has taken the line ""Wear whatever you're comfortable in."" To which I responded that I would wear my suit, which I wore to prom a year ago. She was pretty quiet about it at the time, and now my dad has asked me (independently of my mum) to wear something else, as he thinks I'll ""steal the attention"". 

 I feel like I'm being pushed into a corner by my Dad and I definitely don't want to steal any attention from my mum. 
However, I don't want to wear a dress. I haven't worn a formal dress since the age of 13 and they make me feel very uncomfortable. 

AITA for wanting to wear a suit?

EDIT:

Seems to be some confusion, which is my fault. Forgot to mention that I don't wear women's clothing at all, ever. My parents both know this and my dad has expressed his wishes that I would wear more feminine clothes even though I've told him they make me v unhappy as I don't feel like myself (possibly something to do with gender identity related stuff.). My point is that I think it might be an attempt by my Dad to make me act more like the person he wants me to be.

Also, theres no dress code at all. As i said, very casual wedding. My parents don't even really care about getting married, mostly doing it for the tax benefit. Mum has expressed that she disagrees with my Dad now, and wants me to be comfortable.

EDIT 2:

It may be relevant to some that they are expecting my Brother to wear a suit to the wedding.","NTA.

"AITA for not wanting my son to talk to his dad every night son is with me?. Tldr: dad wants phone call every night son is with me but some nights I don't feel like it and I dont want to encourage son on nights he doesn't feel like it.

Background: My ex and I coparent very well for the most part. I have our son 4 nights out of the week. His father wants to talk to him each of those nights. Sometimes its not convenient, or one of us just doesn't feel like it. I have to be there monitoring because my son is 5 and will walk away from the phone, get distracted, or just not hold it right so his dad can see his face. Calls are between 5-15 minutes long. We use Facebook messenger as there are face filters that make it more fun for son.

They (dad and son) have a close relationship. Dad is a present, loving father which I am grateful for.

Ex is willing to call me the nights son is with him but I am usually busy. My son and I are very close and I dont feel like our relationship is negatively affected by not talking to him every night. In fact, I feel forcing him to phone talk sometimes makes him resentful too. The few times son has requested to talk to me I've always made myself available.

Tonight when ex called, my son asked for 30 minutes because he didnt feel like talking right then. Ex called exactly 30 minutes later and said because I didn't force the issue that son is walking all over me. He also requested that I be more involved in monitoring. Some nights I have walked away to brush teeth, do dishes or just my nightly routine. 
 
I'm becoming resentful of the fact that we dont seem to have an option to not have phone calls certain nights. AITA for feeling resentful? Are these phone calls necessary for my son's relationship with his dad? I don't get the feeling they are, I feel like I'm doing it more for his dad.

"AITA for asking my pregnant SIL to leave the family Christmas gathering?. Okay so based on title I totally sound like an asshole but hear me out. 

So this year is our turn to host the family Christmas party at our home. We invited not only my SOs side but also my side as well. Overall it was around 20ish people in our home today for gift giving and typical American Christmas celebrating. Drinks were shared, food broken, the whole shebang. 

Amongst my SOs side of the family was his pregnant sister. She, I think, was due maybe a week or so ago? But really its just been ticking time bomb for her little one to arrive. Everybodys excited to meet the baby! 

Now our problem is that SIL came to the party with contractions and was obviously in labor (I know this because Im a mom myself - once you know, you know). Every 20 minutes or so she would start having pains and would make noises to pass the contractions. At first it wasnt so bad; I understand how sucky it is and you dont want to go to the hospital too soon because they'll just send you right home. But then it became almost obnoxious. I feel terrible for saying that but it really was. A lot of my family members and some of hers were glancing around like WTF? Go home and do that in private. 

After a while it became apparent that it was making everybody uncomfortable and even my MIL reccommend that she rest at home before it gets too late. She refused and said she was fine. In the middle of the kids opening their presents she went into pain again and this time she even screamed for a second. I then discreetly pulled her husband to the side and told them to leave. I did it politely (""Hey I appreciate you guys for being here but I think its time to go. I dont want you guys to give birth in our kitchen! lol"").

After I said that her husband got angry and quickly got her and the kids packed up. She  visibly upset and before heading out called me a bitch and said that I ruined Christmas for her. A few of their sides family members gave me dirty looks and left soon after.

Im torn on this: I wanted everybody to have a good day but it was very distracting and obnoxious to have her around. I feel bad but still.

"AITA for being upset at my dad’s friend’s son for having a sleepover at my house tomorrow?. Sorry for any grammatical errors or formatting problems I’m typing on mobile. 

So my birthday is tomorrow and I’m inviting some friends tomorrow to play smash ultimate. I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who’s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don’t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I’m not against him staying the night I just don’t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don’t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  

Am I the a hole??

Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up like this . 
Anyway here’s some answers to some questions.

I’m 14 turning 15 

My mom says I’ve seen this kid before, but I feel like it’s in the sense of that Aunty that changed your diaper when you were 1 year old that you don’t remember.

I asked my mom if we’re cousins that I maybe didn’t know about . She said no.

Apparently my mom gives my old clothes to him . 

I don’t think I’ll stand up to my parents. Maybe if I were older and had something to fall back on.

My dad said the kid is staying because his mom wants to go to church and they live really far so it’s just easier to stay the night.

This isn’t the first time they pulled something and didn’t tell me. Around Christmas time my mom signed me up for volunteering at a Christmas play and she didn’t mention it until we got in the car.  We were there for 5 minutes and they didn’t mention we were doing this as a family. The Christmas play was late night and really long so it wasn’t what I wanted to do on my Saturday night. I guess they realized they were in the wrong and didn’t make me go.



Edit 2:  Hey guys I’m back . I’m gonna tell you about my birthday party. So of the 5 people I invited only 1 came and the 10 year old. We had a good time laughing and stuff and I’m pretty friendly with the 10 year old now. The friend left around 15 minutes and we’re just here watching  American idol.

She wasn’t like this but this is a result of her last breakup when she decided she’s gonna stand up for herself but it doesn’t feel like that. 

So for a couple of days she’s making plans to hang out with me and then she cancels them at last moment and then the same happened with other people. She also had a couple of drunken fights with people. She made a common friend of ours cry abusing her. 

So today I tried to talk to her to explain that she’s acting like an asshole to everyone including me and that she has to change this behaviour because people are angry at her. And I also told her she’s drinking way too much and that she needs to tone down. Then she told me I should fuck off and that whatever I said is bullshit. 

I got angry and told her that I’m trying to show concern for you here and if you can’t handle that, then fine, I won’t bring it up again.

Then she started travelling in the south-east of Asia: Indonesia, Cambodia, even India (yes, that's a large south-east), until she travels back to Cambodia where she started to work for a yoga center. Unfortunately, this place will close down by the end of March, and she reached me to deal with one major issue: money.

She told me that she was seeing a personal coach who cost her $90 a month, and that she could pay this person because she joined MLMs like iMarketsLive. She tried to enroll me in several MLMs at once and command me to listen to several cult-like speechmen and watch 90 minutes slide decks on Youtube pretending these might fulfill my dreams one day.

We've been going to an antenatal class for the past few weeks now - relatively small group that I generally get along with; except for this one dad, who seems to be very critical of other parents. In the past he's told some in the group that they should ""just amputate a foot as soon as they're born"" when one couple said they wouldn't outright ban sweets, called parents who watch TV irresponsible (don't ask, no idea) among other things.

Well, my turn came very recently.

The dads were all hanging out during the coffee break and were all shooting the shit about how the pregnancies were going. To preface this, I am a massive sports fan. Usually wear jerseys a lot (I find them comfortable to wear) and am right on top of scores etc. I joked to another dad there who was also a massive sports fanatic that our boy was kicking so hard in the womb that it wouldn't surprise me if they went on to play for my favourite Rugby League team. Old mate overheard and remarked ""Why would you want him to like sports? I'd rather my child were intelligent myself.""

"AITA for wanting to petition for my son's last name to be changed?. So, I have an 8 year old son from a previous relationship. My husband (who loves my son like his own) and I have been happily married for almost 4 years, and we have a 2 year old daughter together, whom my son ADORES. Ever since she was born, my son has been constantly asking when his last name will be the same as ours. He currently has a hyphenated last name of mine and his father's, and I kept my maiden name included with my married name. I've kinda just given him vague answers in the past, but lately he's started writing it on his school papers and asks much more frequently. 

It's gotten to where I'm considering it, because his dad hasn't ever really been a very involved dad. We split up when he just turned 2, and he didn't see him very often, nor pay child support until he was 5. He lived in our apartments for a full year, and still only saw him maybe 2 times a month for an hour or 2 at a time. Last May he up and moved for a girl across the country and he hasn't been back. He'll go for weeks or even months without talking to our son.

"AITA for wanting husband to ditch friend of over a decade?. To start, I know I'm an asshole for overreacting and blocking the friend's number, I'm not asking about that.

My husband (27) has a friend, lets call him Pika(25), who is the textbook example of not willing to grow up. He can't hold a job, lives with his parents, and is really immature. My husband is a bit of a jerk, but mostly it's that he doesn't understand social cues and has a hard time understanding things like embarrassment. Husband is also non-confrontational and let's people get away with WAY too much to keep the peace.

For the past couple months Pika has been saying a lot of things that have gotten on both of our nerves. Constantly calling my husband an asshole, telling him that he needs to handle me better, complaining that he can't get laid on nearly a daily basis. Then asking for favors like to put in a word at husband's job, wanting us to move to a different city so that he can move in with us, coming over on occasion just to eat and leave.
Tonight he asked my husband if he was off work, hubs responded ""nope"". Que Pika telling him how he needs to knock off the attitude, stop being disrespectful to him by saying ""yup/nope"" and say yes or no, and change his tone. Otherwise he says hubs is being intentionally disrespectful, rude and a total asshole on purpose and it's his fault people will see him that way.

 My best friend, his wife, my fiancee, and myself were going to go camping this weekend. Unfortunately the rain has put a damper on those plans, so he's saying I could come to his house instead, (haven't been there yet, they live about 2 hours away).

While talking with him about plan B here, he dropped the line on me about how they ""have a rule that no unmarried couples can sleep together.""

This wasn't a problem when we were going to go camping. And it's not really a problem here for me, I guess, I don't care about separate bunks for a night. It's just incredibly disrespectful.

"AITA For insisting we have a rule for how dice rolls work while playing Risk?. So my sibling is big into table top game but we don't get the opportunity to play many. This weekend  they invited me and our other sibling to come play. We normally  wind up playing kiddy games because they move faster but we decided to try something more advanced this time... Risk!


I was the rule reader  and 90% went okay but there was one rule sibling number 1 insistead didn't  matter. Risks' rulebook says during  a battle both players roll the dice at the same time. Number 1 said this didn't matter and we would just roll. I thought it did matter that was why it was in the rules. 


We got a little loud but I let it go. 


Now the table  we were playing on was unstable  and only big enough for the board. So we decided to throw the dice  in a box we were passing  around.


I suggested we do 1. 2. 3. Go toss the dice and that was that. I got loudly vetoed. ""It doesn't matter ""

I suggested attacking dice roll then defensive dice roll. ""No that's catering to your psychosis "" 


Well during  one of the rounds the attacker called  an invasion. Defensive dice was rolled and then the attacker changed their mind about where the invasion  was going. This lead to questioning if the defensive roll should be kept or rerolled. We decided to keep the defensive roll 


Then in the same game I rolled my defensive dice first and some one rolled attack dice, about  2 minutes after, because the person  I was rolling  against was more interested in their  phone, the attacker's dice knocked into my defensive dice causing the roll  to change and making me lose the battle.

We got into a loud disagreement about if a rule needed to be followed for dice rolling. It ended  when I left the room for a few minutes. We both sort of let our sides go. Number 1 sort of said attack rolls go first and I resolved myself  not to manage dice rolls or questions about battles.


Sibling number 2 was totally silent on the matter


Am I the asshole

I insisted there be a rule for dice rolling because my sibling intentionally ignored the on the rulebook  gave us and we got into a screaming match.","NTA But the proper solution to this is to count the first side the die settles on as your roll.

"AITA for ghosting a stranger?. Hi Reddit, first post!

Five days ago my friend and I (both 18F) went into a fast food place. When we walked in, we were the only customers in the restaurant. We struck up a conversation with the cashier, who told us she was nearly 29, and asked us if either of us had a boyfriend/were looking for one. My friend said no but I said yes. She pulled one of her coworkers over and introduced us. He was also 18, and I tried to talk with him, but he was extremely awkward, not making eye contact, answering questions vaguely if at all, etc. Despite this, my friend and I added them both on snapchat. During this time, the cashier, though she knew my friend was only 18 and had a boyfriend, hit on her repeatedly even though she clearly wasn't into it.

This boy snapped me later that night asking if I thought he was cute and what I was doing. I said yes and that I was about to go to bed. He insisted that I stay up and talk with him, so I did and gave him my number so we could text. Even though he asked me to stay up, he didn't seem that into it. During our hour long conversation, he only asked 4 questions about me/ my interests. I asked most of the questions trying to find out details about him, but he was very vague and said things that rubbed me the wrong way, like saying he had no hobbies or interests outside of work. After our text conversation, I felt like something was very off with him. On Saturday, he texted me and I said I didn't really have time to talk since I was hanging out with other friends, and he said I better not be cheating on him. He was joking, but it also gave me weird vibes since we had only met less than 24 hours ago and I definitely didn't think we were dating. It was at this point that I stopped talking to him completely on snapchat and with text. He sent me one text later that day saying he missed me, but other than that he didn't communicate with me either. In total, we probably only talked for about two hours. Since he was still a stranger, I thought the safest thing I could do was ghost him. 

It was around 3 am this morning, three days after we last talked, when the cashier sent me a snapchat asking why I wasn't talking to the guy. This kind of blindsided me, since besides introducing us, she wasn't really a part of the situation. I felt like I didn't owe this woman an explanation, so I just said I felt like our personalities didn't match. She said that she thought I should have told him that, and since I didn't, she was going to tell him herself. About a minute after she told me this, I got a snapchat from the guy, but I didn't open it. A minute or two later, the woman posted on her snapchat story that I was a ""fake ass female"" and she ""didn't fuck with my kind"". She didn't mention me directly, but it was clearly about me since she posted it a minute after our talk ended. It was then that I unadded both of them from snapchat and blocked the guy's number. 

AITA for ghosting them, or should I have explained myself to one/both of them?","NTA this whole thing is super weird.

She now thinks she's going when no one invited her, and out of the blue, she asked to invite another friend of hers (That's how we found out she thought she was going).

"WIBTA if I told my cousin to stop being greedy?. I (29F) gave my cousin (25F) a weekend citytrip to a big European city for her birthday. I told her she could pick between Amsterdam, Paris, or Cologne, whichever she thought would be the most fun, and I would take her there for a long weekend, all expenses paid. We live in Belgium, so those cities would be a relatively short train ride away.

She was really happy and enthusiastic, but instead of picking one of those cities, she immediately said: “Oh, actually, I would really love to go to Istanbul (Turkey) or Olso (Norway), or ...(naming some other places that were definitely not just a train ride away)!”

I was kinda baffled at this response, because I thought I was already giving her quite a substantial gift, and she immediately demanded more/something different. (And it's not like this is something I gift her every year or something. This is and was meant to be a one off, to celebrate her 25th birthday.)

At that moment I was a bit too taken aback to say anything other than “We'll see”.

The subject came up again a week later when my cousin enthusiastically messaged me with a link to a site with cheap deals for city trips to Istanbul etc, showing that it really did not have to be any more expensive. I tried to remind her that my offer had been for one of those three cities, but she said that she did not like being in such a big metropolitan city because of her anxiety. I told her that a city like Istanbul is hardly going to be peaceful and quiet, but she said that those other cities just didn't really interest her (even though she has never been to any of them).

Right now we're at a bit of an impasse, because she's not budging, and neither am I. I feel like she is being an asshole for being greedy, while at the same time wondering if I'm the asshole for sticking to the “arbitrary” rules of my own gift to her.

The thing is: I feel like I don't really have a good reason to deny her: The trips she named are not necessarily much more expensive. It's not like I would mind going to a different city. And maybe she is just being brutally honest in saying that she did not like my gift?

But at the same time I feel hurt that my gift (and I personally think it is a BIG gift) apparently isn't good enough. I spent time planning and researching the possible trips I offered her, and I feel like she is being greedy and inconsiderate.

Secondly: Obviously I want my cousin to enjoy this gift.

When she told me my three options were just not interesting to her, I suggested cities like Dijon, Frankfurt, Rotterdam etc, but she still said they just ""didn't interest her"".

"WIBTA for backing out of the best man position at a wedding?. So my friend (we’ll call him Jake) is having is wedding at the end of October. We’ve been friends for a long time, almost 9 years, but for the last 4 years we’ve grown apart and barely hung out. He’s gotten a lot closer with other friends than him and I have been, one of those friends is another groomsman (we’ll call him Logan). 

Flash forward to 2 months ago, Jake asked me to be the best man at his wedding. We’d planned on his bachelor party being today but every single plan I suggested he shot down. Didn’t wanna ride anywhere far, didn’t want to go to a bar to watch the game because it would be crowded (this comes in later). 

We ended up settling on watching the football game at my place and drinking. It then turned into his fiancé coming along as well. He then changed the plan to where his other groomsmen couldn’t come so it would just be him, his fiancé, my fiancé and I. Then he changed it to where we were gonna go to a town near Athens. Then he changed it to where we would drive 2+ hours to another town around 11 at night when he knows I have to get up early-ish tomorrow. At that point I let him know my fiancé and I couldn’t go and that we could go next weekend, but if they ended up doing something in town we could still go. 


I hop on Facebook and a photo pops up, turns out him and his other groomsmen went to a sports bar to watch the game and eat. This combined with him being flaky and generally being closer with Logan leaves me wondering why he even picked me to be a best man anyway. I’m considering backing out of my best man role to let someone else fill my shoes, WIBTA?

"AITA for getting a man on my train fined?. Tl:dr - I recorded a man taking up two and a half seats for multiple stops and showed ticket officers the footage, getting him a fine. AITA?

So I get on my train after work at 6 in the city to the outer suburbs, everybody dashes for what seat are available and I snag one next to this biggish guy. This guy was pretty overweight, but if he sat properly he would be fine.

On Metro trains, seats are grouped in four like


oo  
oo

With another set of four across. I got the lower left seat, but this selfish yobbo was on the upper right and had one leg across on the other, and his other leg taking up half of the seat on his right (across from me) an asian man took the seat, but could only sit on half of it.

At first I thought this guy was sleeping. I shook his leg several times and asked if he could move his legs to no response, when my voice started to raise a person said ""just drop it mate, hes not moving"". So whatever, I left him to his coma. We hit Richmond, he wakes up, looks at me, looks out the window. AND DOESNT MOVE. 

So I see the asian man take a photo of his face, and I get an idea. Lets shame the asshole. So I take out my phone and start recording in selfie mode each time we arrive at the next stop, so the mic picks up the announcer saying ""now arriving at x"". I also shake his leg again, to which he tell me to bugger off. So now I can prove hes awake. Originally I was going to stitch it all together and post it in r/melbourne. But something better happened. When we got to one of the outer suburb stops, officers got on the carriage for inspection. He hears them asking for tickets and moves his legs.

"WIBTA for wanting to talk to my roommate about a ""doggy cam"" she put in the living room AND having her sister come visit unannounced for and an indefinite amount of time.. For those that want it, Ill be doing an optional background segment in the comments for our living situation.

So first issue is first. Our roommate was gone for a week staying at her friend's. Well one day she shows back up at the apartment but with company, her out of town sister. No heads up, no communication. My fiancee and myself didn't even know who the hell was staying at our place the first night, we just heard two voices in our roommates room. We found out it was the sister the next day. The sister has been with us now for 3-4 days and we have no clue when she is leaving. Which the sister's presence is not a big deal. We like her well enough. Just don't like the lack of courtesy in communication and also the apparent entitlement that our roommate has over the spare bedroom. I just feel like if we had my fiancee's brother show up unannounced and put him in the guest bedroom days on end without telling our roommate any details, well she would be pissed.

Second issue, our roommate has gotten this fancy dog monitor device with an HD camera and 2 way audio system built in. The user can interact with it at any time and place via their cell phone. It even dispenses treats and auto activates the camera/alerts the owner whenever the dog barks or walks near the camera. It has a person alert function too if a person walks near the camera. She can turn it on at any time from her phone. She originally got the camera device for her own bedroom to monitor the dog where she used to keep him. That's fine, her private room... her space... But now she has randomly taken to leaving the dog out in the living room and moved her fancy dog camera in there. Which means she can pick up video and audio in the living room at random. Which I know she is not intentionally trying to spy on us and just wants to keep an eye on her dog. None the less, it's creepy. I'm getting some serious big brother vibes.

"AITA for leaving a package for my neighbor outdoors?. Hey Reddit,

First time poster here... I live in Germany, but it's not really about the legal aspects, but maybe helps to place the mentality of people involved.

So I live in a big apartment complex with almost 90 flats and I was home when a delivery guy ringed and asked to accept 4 boxes for 4 different neighbors. This is the first time I did this, because usually I'm not at home during the day. I thought he has a hard job, so why not...
1 package was really big and heavy and I don't have the space in my flat. It's like an arcade in front of my flat door, 1 apartment behind mine, the house is  shaped like a U, so I'm almost at the end of the floor.
(sorry, english is only my second language, hope this is understandable as I describe it)
So 2 neighbors picked up their packages yesterday, today the one shows up that owns the huge package and asks me, why it is standing in front of my door. I told him, I'm sorry, it was heavy and I didn't have the space for it, so he goes on and and says it was my responsibility and if someone had stolen it, I would be liable.

"AITA for ditching some friends that I thought got toxic?. I tried to write the title un-biased but it didn't really turn out that way

So, I've always had low self esteem and I've always had a skewed social role if that makes sense. As in, I think no one cares about me and all that. 

Anyways so, I'll use pseudonyms for their names: Bart, Karen and Joan. Bart and Karen had always been pretty mean to me. Saying shit that most certainly would not read like a joke if you saw it out of context, like recently off the top of my head I can think of ""sit in the back Rosa Parks"" (I'm black) and numerous quips about my arthritis and fibromyalgia. For some reason Bart thought it was hilarious to constantly make fun of me because I have arthritis. Karen was just mean as fuck for no reason. She'd constantly insult me. One time I told her ""you have a pretty laugh"" and she for real said ""shut the fuck up"". I'm not even kidding.

And the story basically starts around that time. I was with Bart and we were just driving around trying to find something to do. We decided to hang out with Karen and went to pick her up. I was sitting in the front seat, but as soon as we picked up Karen, Bart became a huge fucking dick. They made a huge deal about me sitting in the front seat and made me get in the back and made jokes about Rosa parks and shit the entire way.

Then when we finally got somewhere and got out, I literally could not say anything without them making me the butt of their joke. I wish I could say I was joking. The entire night was like that and they made me feel like absolute shit about myself.

This is why I'm conflicted, because it'd be black and white otherwise: these two were friends for a long time. I've known them since my freshman and sophomore year of high school, and they were a lot different when we first met. Karen was super sweet and Bart was just fun to me around. And they've both done nice things for me before. Bart let me borrow his graphics card while he was away in college because I couldn't run MGSV on mine. Karen left me this sweet note for my birthday about how I've always tried to be there for her. Because of stuff like that, I've always tried to hold out for them, but after that night, I was kind of done with Karen.

I told Bart a couple days later I was getting sick of Karen and wanted to distance myself from her. I had told her several times I was sick of her constantly being mean to me and insulting me, and she never listened. I felt as though it was a lost cause and we just weren't gonna mesh well as people and we just both needed to move on (because she would also constantly go to my girlfriend to talk shit about me. I mean like all the time). 

Bart took it upon himself to lecture me and then tell Karen that I *blocked* her on everything—which I didn't—and instead of coming to me and asking me about it, Karen went to my girlfriend and asked her to ask me. So, like always, Karen is putting my girlfriend in between me and her. I got really frustrated with Bart.

And here's the straw that broke the camel's back and where Joan comes in: I had to quit my job. I was working in a grocery store, but like I said, I have fibromyalgia and arthritis. I even had a doctor's note explaining this and they kept me doing heavy shit after I requested many times to switch me to something easier. I even called them like nine times over a week because they took me off the schedule while waiting for a doctor's note, and they kept hanging up the phone immediately after answering. I just couldn't do it. My body wouldn't let me do it. 

Joan always claimed she got me the job because she ""put a good word in"" for me but she lied to management and told them I had a car and I could make it at 6 every day. So they had me scheduled for something I couldn't even do. When I quit, Joan texted me saying I was ""making her look bad"" and all of this shit and she was just really freaking out. I was trying not to be a dick and straight up tell her she just made it worse, so I was just saying platitudes like ""it's not a big deal"" and ""it'll be ok"", all that.

Bart's trying to get in Joan's pants, so he hits me up and starts lecturing me on how this shit matters and how every entry level job is gonna treat me like that and all that. At this point, I'm just really fed up with Bart, and I say ""look, I know you've got a thing for Joan and all, but don't lecture me on every little thing I do just because it doesn't make her feel good"". He tells me ""Joan is just a friend. Tread lightly"". 

And after everything, Bart was the one telling *me* to tread lightly? I got really mad and just told him everything he's done to make me feel like shit about myself along with Karen and that all they ever do is make me the butt of their joke and insult me. They make me their outlet and whenever they get mad or upset at something they take it out on me. They both know how depressed I've been this past month and they kept doing that shit. I was conflicted and still willing to try to be friends because Bart would check up on me from time to time to make sure I was ok, but the thing he said in response to all of that really just pushed me over the edge.

He just goes ""you do you, bud"". 

I was like are you serious, and that was it. I didn't say anything else to him that night. I removed him and Karen off of all of my social media and deleted their numbers. I've been feeling better about myself since, but I still feel guilt about the whole thing. I don't know why. I wonder if I made the right choice or not.

EDIT: I should add I actually tried to make it up with Bart and I told him I'd give him his graphics card back, but he kept making these comments like ""well if I make you that unhappy I'm not gonna get in your way"" and then left me on read. I thought he mightve been sincere, but he just told Karen everything I said to him and Karen cussed me out last night.

I told these guys a bunch of times they were being dicks for no reason and they just brushed it off. But I can't help but feel like I didn't make the right choice. My girlfriend keeps reassuring me I did. But I don't know. I feel bad. They were long time friends. I felt like I had to stand up for myself but did I really do that or did I just cut off two people for no reason? 

EDIT2: thanks for the comments guys.",These people sound fucking horrible and you should absolutely distance yourself from them.

"AITA for not giving a homeless person some food that they requested?. I was on the subway to work and a homeless women was walking up and down the train asking for some spare change. Rather than giving them a few dollars, I decided that I would give them something from my lunch. I had an extra apple and banana in my lunch that day so I offered that to them. They rudely declined my offer and asked if I had anything else to eat, looking into my lunch bag. I had my main meal and a couple of snacks, but since I had two apples and two bananas, that’s what I thought to offer. I said that I didn’t have anything else to give them and they called me an asshole and walked away.

"WIBTA If I denied my 11 y/o from having Christmas with his bio?. Back stock- My exhusband and I have an 11 year old son. We've both remarried. I moved to another state 4 hours from ""home"" to be near my husband's mother. My ex and his current wife had a son 2 years ago. Since then, my son has seen and heard from his bio less and less to the point that now it is only a week at Christmas and 2 weeks during the summer. We bought my son a cell so he could keep in touch with his bio. The man never calls or texts my son back. Over the summer break, my son asked my ex why he abandoned him. He made excuses of he works graveyard and that I won't meet him. (In the custody paperwork it clearly states the father is to provide transportation to and from visitation. I used to meet, but as it became less frequent, he can come see his son if he wants.)

So, with that in mind, I finally broke down and sent a text asking about his plans with our son for Christmas today. He stated that he works that night but can pick him up by 12:30 at the latest, unless I meet him halfway. WITBA if I refused his offer? I would have to pack up my son in the morning right after opening presents and we would miss Christmas dinner with the rest of the family just so he can spend almost his entire Christmas in a car, then not see his bio for 2 more days.

"AITA for telling parents checking into hotel that we found heroin between the mattress in our room?. I apologies for the long story and grammar, today was crazy. My mom and her boyfriend came into town today and had a few problem checking in to their hotel. After 2 hours of waiting around for there system to fix they get checked in, and head up to their non-smoking room which wreaked of cigarettes and had  trash so complain. My mom says the place doesn't feel clean, so I decided to check the mattress for bugs as boyfriend comes in. I lift the sheets, look in the seams, and then pick the mattress corner up. I see a little black purse toward the end of the bed and call my moms boyfriend over. He grabs it, opens it, and takes out the first thing in it. It was a bloody rag full of blood, a needle, and heroin. He immediately packed everything up and stormed off to the desk. I was extremely upset about all this because my child was in the room to witness everything and could have played in it if not found.

I head outside by myself to calm down and I see a car with a mother and her to small kids outside the lobby with the husband checking in near by. I go over to the car and knock on the window and smile. She opens the door a little and I say ""Hello, are you about to stay in this hotel?"" She looked and me and said yes in a European accent. I then told her ""My parent just recently checked into this hotel and we just found heroin in between the mattress, please check between them. I don't want anything to happen to your children.""

I looked at her and raised my voice as well and say ""We found heroin in between the mattresses with my son (pointed and my son) in the room that is what is fucking ridiculous!""

"WIBTA If I told my brother’s girlfriend she can do better?. I know I sound like a major asshole based on that title. Please keep reading.

I’ve never gotten along with my brother (17yo). He has a history of being verbally, emotionally, and even at times physically abusive towards me, and to a lesser extent my parents. He’s manipulative, lies constantly, and tries his best to make everyone around him feel like crap. I know teenagers are difficult and treat most people like garbage, but my brother seems to have taken notes from growing up with my abusive father, and imitates his abusive behavior, only worse. Where as my father has recently gotten help and has actually gotten a lot less abusive, my brother has only gotten worse.

He recently started dating this girl (also 17). We will call her Riley (not her real name, obviously). It’s his first relationship. My brother doesn’t let Riley talk to me or our parents very often. If she tries to speak to us, she is quickly reprimanded by my brother and whisked off into his room with the door locked. But from what I have seen of her, she seems shy and has low self-esteem. The moment my brother tells her something she’s doing is wrong, she stops and seems to shut down.

Granted, I was in an abusive relationship in high school, and it’s entirely possible that I might be projecting my own experiences onto this girl. I also understand that it really isn’t any of my business. I’m just his sister. No one asked for my opinion on their relationship.

But I feel so bad for her, and I wish there was something I could do to help. Even through closed doors, I can here my brother screaming at her; criticizing her for little things that really don’t matter, like texting him too late or going out with friends without telling him first. 

I know she isn’t going to tell her mother any of this. From the little I have spoken to her, she conveyed the fact that her single mother didn’t really care and just wanted her out of the house. She spoke about her like they were very distant. I was actually very surprised that she came out with that kind of topic as quickly as she did. I would talk to my parents about it, but given that they are themselves an abuser and an enabler, this kind of behavior seems normal to them.

I just hate seeing my brother treating this poor girl like shit, and I want to tell her what I wish someone had told me when I was a teen in a similar type of relationship: You can do so much better. You don’t have to take this kind of abuse. You deserve to be treated with respect. Find someone who will treat you the way you deserve. There’s plenty of people out there.

At the same time, I don’t want to overstep my boundaries. I don’t really have definitive proof that he is any more mean to her than he is to everyone else. She doesn’t seem too upset, although again I haven’t interacted with her very much. And she’s not in any real danger besides dating a douche. My brother has never gotten physical with anyone other than myself. And again, it’s very possible that I could be projecting my emotions onto her as a result of my high school experience. Would I be the asshole if I told her she could do better? Or should I keep my mouth shut and let this thing play out?

into a pretzel doing unmentionable things a year or so ago. Why? Because it’s obnoxious and disrespectful. It has nothing to do with being insecure; it has to do with respecting your partner. Once you’ve had sex with someone, it’s crossed a boundary where, if you’re dating me now, she had better be a long forgotten memory and not someone you get together with for a movie, pizza, and a game of Cards Against Humanity.

"AITA for being pissed off at my brother?. First off, i dont think this is too deep, so dont expect much.

I (14) am mad at my brother (10) for eating my sandwich filling.

My mum makes all three of us (me, bro, dad) sandwiches for work and school. So, all three lunches were in the fridge this morning. What was also in the fridge was my sandwich filling for tomorrow, which i have been looking forward to all day (i have a bit of a shitty life atm, on the brink of mental hospital again because of it all), because im only living for the little things in life rn. 

Outside of this situation, we usually get on really well, even though it usually revolves around me taking him out for food, and he usually convinces me to buy him a dvd or a toy or something.

my brother took this to school for lunch instead of his sandwich, and im pissed. he always makes these ""little"" mistakes which i bear the brunt of, and for some reason this has just broken me.

Other examples of ""little"" things he's done is: hiding stuff i need just as im leaving for school, scratched my watch face, hogs the tv to the point where i no longer follow any tv shows because i cant watch anything ever, etc. 

My mum babies him, ""its not his fault, he's only little"", ""he's under a lot of stress about... you recently"" (i came out as an LGBTQ identity and he's taken it best out of all of them).

"AITA for reporting the guy who groped my girlfriend’s friend to the school. Please don’t berate me if you disagree with what i did. I genuinely don’t know if iata and am willing to take what i learn from this thread to help improve my future decisions. 

A few months ago my friend’s girlfriend was grabbed by the butt by a guy in the hallway. He is a freshman, and in the middle school has touched nearly a dozen other girl’s butts and they went to the middle school principal and nothing was done about it. 

Then a couple weeks into his freshman year he grabbed a friend of my girlfriend’s butt in the hallway on the way to lunch. Our school got refitted with cameras this year. Every classroom has a camera and every part of nearly every hallway is on camera too. He tried to play it off and kept walking. I was told about this. The girl who was groped was upset over it but didn’t want to report it for various reasons. I asked my girlfriend when and where it happened so that i could report it to the school. And so i went to one of the few administrators i trust in the school (i’m not a freshman so i’m familiar with the administration, most people are new). And i told her when where and what the kid’s name was. She went onto the cameras and got the evidence. The kid was called up to the office during a class with the girl who was groped and my girlfriend. So the girl who was groped found out and got upset. And my girlfriend sides with her friend on this. 

I debated reporting it before i did. My reasoning was not me trying to be a savior. I knew the girl probably wouldn’t like it if i reported it. The reason i did was because my girlfriend also has 2 classes with this kid. And should it happen to her and i didn’t report it, especially if it happened on camera then she likely wouldn’t be believed or not much would happen. I don’t know what kind of punishment (if any) the kid received but i don’t doubt that if he gets caught again he will get in a lot. Also, this kid has done it to other girls at the middle school and got away with it. I thought if he got caught the first time he did it in the high school with all the cameras it would act as a deterrent and he at least wouldn’t try it again during school. Finally, i also thought if he got away with it he would surely do it again to someone else. Even if it was not my girlfriend. And that any future victims would appreciate the evidence from the previous time because it was 100% proven on camera. Thus the next victim might not need video evidence. ","NTA in my opinion. I understand why the girl was upset, since she told you that she didn't want to report the incident, but in doing so you might have prevented others from being groped.

"AITA For taking the money my grandmother left for me in her will.   When my grandma passed away a few years ago her grandchildren were informed that in her will she had requested for all of us to be given $5,000 and then the rest of her assets to be split between her two sons (my dad and my uncle). At the time I was underage so I assumed that I wouldn’t be able to get the money for a while since usually when a trust is set up you have to be a certain age to get access to the money. 
        So I waited and by the time I turned 18 my dad owed $14,000 to my mom for unpaid child support which then caused a lien to be put on my mothers house since his name was still on the house from when they were together. So there is a lien on my mothers house and the only way to get rid of it is to pay what is owed, which is the money my dad owes her so she would be paying her own child support. 
         After I found out about the lien I went to the bank to find out if debt collectors would even be able to take the money if it was in a trust since his name is still on the account. And I should point out the fact that he has all of his money hidden so they can’t find it and take it. So when I went to check out the account I found out that he had not put it in a trust but just a joint account with me as the primary person on the account (which wasn’t even set up properly because I should’ve been present while he was setting it up). So I asked the guy at the bank what his advice was since my dad had debt collectors after him and I was told that I should make a new account and transfer the money over since his name was on the account also.

I have a 16 year old son with severe physical disabilities. He uses a motorized wheelchair and requires help to get in and out of it.

My son recently announced that he is dating a 17 year old girl from the group. My only problem is that this girl has severe mental and physical disabilities. She has the mental capacity of a young child, is mostly nonverbal and has tics that will cause her to hit other people in the vicinity.

My son has zero mental disabilities. I was very uncomfortable with this relationship because of the huge difference in mental capabilities. My husband felt the same but not as strongly.

"AITA I (M36) asked gf (32) about new security on her messages. Sitting with my girlfriend, she got her phone out to send a message and I noticed she had activated fingerprint security for that app specifically. It isn't something I'd ever noticed before and so I asked her why she had activated it.

The reason was because she didn't want the kids to be able to read her messages if they were using her phone. I said that seems quite illogical, of the 2 children, one has their own phone so doesn't use hers, and the other one uses it very rarely, about 2 times a month.

To add an extra step to access an app that you use more than 50 times a day because one of the kids uses the phone 2 times a month doesn't make sense to me.

"AITA for telling a gay person to “Leave me the fuck alone”. So recently our school received a gay student at my school who I’ll call Dave. Dave is gay and he made sure we all knew that. So our class schedule changed meaning our lunch changes making us change who we eat lunch with.

So when me and my friends sat down to eat lunch and Dave sat with us, and we didn’t think anything of it at first until halfway through lunchtime he said (No joke) “Hi everyone, my name’s Dave and I’m gay”. We didn’t care and didn’t give any attention to him...   until he started hitting on us. At first he said stuff like “I want to swallow your kids”  and  “I want to see you in bed”, however these comments were mainly directed at me.

So recently he started getting more up close and personal like screaming in my ear and getting face to face, in me and my friends opinion to close. So on Valentine’s Day he said “I want you to be mine” and touched my upper thigh. I was shocked. I shouted “Get the fuck away from me!” He moved seats and started crying.

So this story has a lot of moving parts so hopefully I do a decent job explaining what happened. My grandparents and their neighbors share a fence, and when the part of the fence that's on my grandfather's property needs to be replaced I've been replacing them for him. His neighbor recently said he needed to have part of the fence on his property removed and my grandfather volunteered me, well he didnt completely volunteer me but he said I usually fix his fenced and told the guy he would talk to me about it so I didnt really have a choice. Anyway, I'm not a professional, I've only removed fence posts a few times, but me and the guy agreed that I would fix it for $100. So I go over to remove the post and install a new one, but after 2 hours of working I find out there is a 3 foot wide and 2 foot deep slab of concrete underneath the fence post, and the fence rotted away where the post met the concrete block so there wasnt really a way to take it out without power tools (which I didnt have) or multiple days of work (which I dont have either because I'm in college right now and my schedule is pretty packed). On top of me not being able to remove the fence post my father (who was at my grandparents house because we all go over there on weekends to see my grandparents because they're old and need help with stuff) took over after I worked for 2 hours because sometimes he cant fucking control himself and started hacking at the ground with a pickaxe and broke my neighbors fence. After all this happened I explained to my neighbor that I couldn't fix the fence because I needed a jackhammer to break apart the concrete at the bottom (or else I would have had to spend multiple days working on this thing while I have papers due and the job should have only taken an hour or two if the concrete hadn't have been there), and that my grandfather's fence posts usually take an hour or so to remove because they dont have concrete on the bottom so while I'm prepared and know how to take out my grandfathers fence posts I told the neighbor he should hire a professional or rent some power tools to dig up the pole himself because I'm not going to be able to get it done. So after this the guy offers to give me some money for my time (I spent 2 hours working and removed a lot of dirt that he would have to remove if i didnt do it) and I said yes because I'm a broke college student and need money for gas so he gave me $60. Am I the asshole for taking the money?

My husband is the one that booked the room and is paying for it. Since we have us and the 2 kids we figured we would take the king bed and my mother in law could have the common area with the pull out bed. 

It’s important to know that the only time we will be in the room is to sleep. Our Itinerary is packed between jet ski trips to different islands, the aquarium, swimming with dolphins, and a few other things. I’m not bragging I’m just stressing of how little time we are actually going to be in this room. 

2 days ago my MIL was told about the sleeping arrangements and threw a fit. She said it wasn’t fair we got the big bed & she got a couch. We offered to trade with her & she refused saying she wanted her own space. At this point my husband gave in and booked her her own room. So now instead of $600 it’s going to over $1000 we’re paying for 3 freaking days in a room we’re only sleeping in. 

I was pretty pissed and told her she better not come to our room at all since she was so hellbent on having “her own space”. 

Of course she says I’m TA and I’ll admit what I said was pretty petty but I stand by it. My husband is torn because he doesn’t want to get into the middle of it. I’m conflicted because I probably shouldn’t have said that to her it was childish but I feel like my being mad is justified. And no she will not pay for her own room. 

So AITA?","NTA, i don't understand why the MIL is coming along or why she wouldn't pay for her own room if she wants it.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for ""flaking""?. Alright, so let me set the scene. I live in a town about an hour and a half to two hours away from my grandparents house. My family and I often go to dinner there roughly once or twice a month. Recently, there was a holiday and my grandparents invited my whole family. I had previous arrangements of a date with a girl that I really liked. I politely called them and explained it to them and they didn't understand. I have called countless times with no response. My brother was also not able to attend because he had work but they were primarily upset with me. They told my parents that it felt that I didn't love them by missing that dinner, which is absolutely a childish thing to say, as they are my grandparents.

"AITA for not letting my grandmother keep my daughter for a few nights?. So let me explain. My husband and I live in the southern US and both of our families live up north, it’s an 18 hour drive one way. We are currently planning on driving our daughter up there this summer and letting her spend a month split between her grandparents, she’ll be 7yo this summer. My grandmother (daughters great grandmother, or GG) caught wind of this and is now demanding that we let her take our daughter for three days and nights.

Here’s the issue, GG and I do not get along at all because she is extremely toxic. The best example is when she acted like I didn’t exist for 7 years, yes you read that right, all because 13yo me told her that she wouldn’t have to keep asking us what was happening in the movie if she’d stop talking while it was playing. So for 7 years anytime she came over she would completely ignore me. She’d buy presents for everyone in my family at Christmas but I wouldn’t get anything. She’d bring steak for the family dinner and I’d have to make myself PB&J, lots of things like that. She has never apologized for this behavior and acts like it never happened.

I’ve told both families that I am not ok with GG taking my daughter for any period of time and now they are telling me I am a horrible person for not letting GG spend time with my daughter. I am now considering cancelling the trip because I’m afraid one of them will go against what I want.

My husband understands why I don’t want GG to be alone with our daughter but is frustrated about possibly canceling the trip since he is looking forward to some kid free time. So, AITA?","NTA you are the parent and you get to parent your child however you want.

"AITA for not going the extra mile to cater to my friend's allergy?. I am in a group of about ten friends who all met in high school. Usually about once every few months, one of us will host a party so that those who are free can get together.

&#x200B;

One of these friends is allergic to milk, but he's not *horribly* allergic. He can have some things that have a little milk, i.e. dark chocolate, buttered breadsticks, stuff like that. Still, when someone's hosting a party and they order pizza for dinner, he's said a few little things that indicate that he expects them to get a cheeseless pizza for himself. Keep in mind, we do make sure that we serve things he can eat (i.e. aforementioned breadsticks, he can take the cheese off the pizza and eat it that way, chips, other food). Also keep in mind most of us are in college and don't exactly have a lot of money to spend on an extra cheeseless pizza just for him (if I was making a lot more money, I wouldn't put up as much of a fight).

&#x200B;

He's never been particularly rude about it, but the fact that he has indicated to be catered to that degree bugged a few of my friends, who mentioned it to me. A bit later, while he and I were talking one day, I told him about that we shouldn't have to cater to him. He was kinda defensive about it, but neither of us really were jerks about it. We ended in a stalemate, though, with neither of us really yielding.

&#x200B;

This discussion with him happened months ago, and we're still really good friends (it hasn't been brought up since), but I've always wondered about which one of us was in the right. I can understand how having an allergy can be hard, and I feel like it's generally on the host to make sure everybody's accommodated, so I kinda feel bad, but at the same time, this seems a little excessive to me. So, AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Let me clarify, he can take the cheese off a normal pizza and eat it that way, and it's essentially the same. It's not like we're denying him the main course. 

We generally get (ready-made) pizza because it's cheap and we're poor. If we could afford to get something more expensive that still accommodates him, we would (or, at least, I would).","My kids have multiple allergies so I'm accustomed to dealing with their food when we go out. We always treat is as an our problem not the hosts problem. When hosts arrange to make stuff specially for them, we're appreciative but we never demand it.

"AITA for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after I got rich?. My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I’m 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. 

When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn’t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that’s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I’m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we’ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I’m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don’t. She keeps telling me that ‘even if I don’t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they’re innocent in all this’ 

AITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family? IMO she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. I just can’t forgive her though.","NTA.

"WIBTA if I gave away my grandmother's wedding ring?. I loved my grandmother deeply and had a special bond with her. After she died her children decided to give me the heavy gold wedding band she'd worn every day for decades. The manner in which this came to pass carries heavy emotional baggage for me and looking at the ring brings up the dark feelings attached. It also doesn't fit my finger and for me is too heavy to wear on a chain. So it sits in its velvet box.

I have a huge family and at least a dozen other aunts and cousins and niblings who might want it now or one day in the future. But giving it to only one of them might cause hard feelings from others for a long time. It might also drag up questions about why I don't want it. I don't have children. I've just kind of held onto it.

After my grandmother died we discovered that she had a half-sister alive and well living in a different country. As a family we have grown close to this new branch of relatives. I live the closest and when my grandmother's sister passed on, I attended the funeral and was met with open arms by her three children and their families and loved ones. Of the three of them, only one had a child -- whose wedding I will be attending this weekend. I would like to give the ring to the mother of the groom, my grandmother's niece whom she never met.

"AITA for starting to dislike my elderly neighbour. My neighbour (an 80 year old woman) is a textbook cute old lady and we have a friendly relationship. I’ll go over to her place to help her with tasks like sending emails, helping move things, explaining Facebook, doing her nails etc, and in return I get delicious baked goods and a nice chat. We get along for the most part, but lately some of the things she says really disturb me, sometimes to the point of being pissed of. She listens to a lot of far right shock jocks (like many of the elderly here in Australia) and personally I’m more politically central, but I have the good sense not to bring up politics in everyday conversations. She doesn’t bring it up all the time, but when she does, a lot of the shit she says (about climate, housing, etc) is really starting to piss me off and while I wouldn’t be rude to her, I’m considering trying to distance myself. 

I feel like a dick because I know she’s old and it’s probably all she knows, and I know she relies on me somewhat heavily for certain things like technology, but it’s really starting to get to me.

"AITA for telling a girl she should have told me she had scars before I started tattooing her, and not refunding her deposit?. I (25m) am a tattoo artist in London. I have a decent following online and this is how I get most of my appointments. A girl contacted me through Instagram to book in for a tattoo on her leg. Her plan was for a large tattoo (would take a full day sitting, maybe more if she was a bad sitter), so I took a £100 deposit as I always do for long appointments. 

Every time someone contacts me for a tattoo, I send them a list of terms and conditions that outline parts of the booking process; the ones relevant to this scenario are that deposits are non-refundable, and that the skin has to be fit for tattooing with no keloid scarring (the style of tattoo that I do will not stick in keloid-scarred skin), and no scars that are less than a year old, etc. I also request that if a client has a scar that will be in the tattooed area, they should send a picture. I also clarified what a keloid scar is, just to be sure. 

So, the girl turns up, and she gets out her leg, which has a huge keloid scar through the middle of the area she wants tattooed. She says she got it in a car accident and she needs it to be covered because it distresses her. I told her that I'm really sorry to have to tell her, but I can't tattoo over her scar. It was very raised and clearly not fully settled, so even if I did a different style of tattoo, it wouldn't be a good idea. 

She got quite upset and asked if I could just try. I told her no, because I don't want to be sued if tattooing the scar messes up the healing of the scar. She then got angry, and demanded her deposit back. This is where I think I'm the asshole, because I immediately said no way. I told her that I sent her a list of the rules before the appointment that make it very clear she needed to make it known that she had a scar, and her disregard of these rules has essentially lost me around £600 of revenue because I'm unlikely to fill the slots for the day that I'd reserved for her. She was super mad, and stormed out after slapping my bottle of pepsi onto the floor. She left a horrible review online, and I do feel like a dick to be honest.

"AITA for complaining to my neighbours about their autistic child?. So just for some context. I'm a 22 year old university student and live at home with my mother who stopped working and does her dialysis at home. The neighbours moved in maybe two months ago and have two children.

"AITA for holding up the bus?. Throwaway here 

So this happened about three months ago, but I only just now found out about this sub. I’m still not sure about this situation, as my friends seem to disagree on it. 

So up until this incident, I (15f) was not having a good day. We were on a field trip to a museum, and I was stuck in a group with two people that I can’t stand. The day was long and boring, and I hadn’t had breakfast (this is important). At the end of the trip, the two people I didn’t like didn’t show up at the group’s assigned meeting place. 

The teachers let everyone go to the buses but my group. They made us wait for these two for twenty minutes until they were finally found and our group had to walk to the bus, in front of everyone that “we” had held up. 

We got on, and as I went to my seat, where I had left my lunch, I noticed that my lunch was gone. I asked everyone around me, then went up to the front of the bus, where all the teachers were, and asked if any of them had seen it. The bus driver said “okay, sit down.” Here’s how it went after that:

Me: can I check the trash can?
Bus driver: just sit down. 
Me: please, it will only take a second. 
Bus driver: Can’t you just check when we get back? Sit down. 
Me: No! I’m not sitting down until I find my lunch

"AITA if I demand an employee stop a cultural practice that I find abhorrent but is no big deal to him?. Got 3 male employees.  One of them grew up in Mexico.

"AITA for being tired of criticism?. So, i started talking to this guy. we met up a couple of times and things were going okay. the only problem was we were obviously very different, i’m more emotion driven and he was more logic driven. we would often have debates that would sometimes get heated but normally it wasn’t a big deal, until i noticed him constantly criticizing me. (along with a few other things, complaining about his grades even though he had all A’s, and seeming a little self centered). He would always say i was lazy and unorganized and a procrastinator and how he wanted to help me improve. and at first i was like, okay, fair enough. i have always been somewhat of a scatterbrain. but, he would continue to bring this up, and keep in mind, i had only know this guy a couple weeks and we’re only in college, so i say, “hey can you stop bringing up all my faults constantly it makes me feel bad.”  

at first he didn’t understand so i have to explain to him that it feels like he doesn’t even like me for me because it really feels like he wants to change me. so, i thought he got it, but his behavior didn’t change, so eventually i kind of snapped. I said “you need to stop criticizing me constantly. i’m fully aware that you want the best for me, but it makes me feel bad when you constantly point out my flaws. i’m fully aware of my flaws.” then he says “okay we’re clearly too different and we can’t date.” and i was like “okay fine.” so, the next day he just messaged me like nothing happened and i, still annoyed, give him one word responses until he finally catches on and asks “hey are you still mad?”

so i’m kinda like “yeah, obviously.” that’s where things popped off. he goes off about how i can’t handle criticism and how i’m lazy, immature, can’t handle criticism, how i’ll never get anywhere in life, and a few other things. so i’m like, yeah that’s valid but you constantly bring these things up and it feels like you don’t even like me. so then he proceeds to block me on everything, but not before screenshotting our messages (this was on snapchat so i got a notification.) and i say “hey can you not screenshot our private conversation that makes me uncomfortable.” and he says “no i have a right to screenshot our messages if i want.”

"AITA for not missing a kind of crappy friend?. I just want to apologize in advance for any misspellings, as english is not my first language.

&#x200B;

So me (20F) and my oldest bestfriend (20F), lets call her G, have been inseparable for around 15 years. Around 7 or so years ago, we met another girl, R (21F) in school. For the past 7 years we've been like sisters. Always told eachother everything and we're always there for support. 

Around late 2017, R dated a really crappy guy, he did loads of drugs, was really controlling, and me and G always tried hard to give her loads of support due to her situation. Me, being the mom-friend that I am, always kept tabs on what she told me, how he behaved and such. They broke up, and she perked up a lot. She was back to being her happy self again. 

They got back together. By around that time, me and G only really talked to her when she wanted to vent. R didn't really know what was going on in our lives, because she never asked. We were there to listen only. I got really tired of that eventually, but still was there for support. Soon after she stopped talking to us. They broke up some months later and she came back crying, apologizing, telling she should have never left us, and that we were her best friends, looking out for her and her alone. 

&#x200B;

Mid 2018 she started dating a new guy. She seemed happy and all, so we were confident things were going to work. G decided to grab a coffee with all of us (my bf, her bf, me, her, R and her new guy) for her bday in Sept, and R took that as a chance to introduce us to S (her new guy). The friends outing ended really well imo. R wasn't happy, as we haven't given enough attention to her boyfriend, and he felt left out. He only seemed to like me, out of everyone. 

&#x200B;

Now, I didn't really like the guy, but I tried to be as nice as I could. R was mad at us for four months, she didn't talk, text, not even checking in to see how anyone was, prob until like January '19. We got together for some coffee and laid it all out, explained stuff, and all was well again. We even made plans to get everyone together again, so that S could have a better experience. 

Except... she didn't talk to us anymore to set a date and time. And we waited. Even sent a text here and there, which was answered really coldly and rude. 

Today (August 28th) we recieve a text on the group chat which i didn't open, that said something like ""we haven't talked in a long..."" (time? i think).

&#x200B;

She hasn't shown interest in being present in our lives, she hasn't cared at all. The last times we talked were about HER and for her to vent. I don't really miss her, although she was a special and close friend to me sometime ago. But we drifted apart, and I don't feel like sacrificing my mental health (or G's) being R's therapist all over again.

"AITA for calling my sister a bad mom for jumping back into an abusive relationship?. To keep it short and sweet my sister has one child (my niece who is 5) and has been in an unhealthy, emotionally and mentally abusive relationship with her boyfriend James. 

James does not work, can’t hold down a job, has 4 children with a different woman, and constantly berates my sister for her hard work. My sister is a full time student, and works full time as well. (31f) 

She recently had a dramatic episode with him and called the police to have him removed from their apartment. 

I was very happy about this because my niece has had to watch them fight constantly for months, and I was concerned for her mental health. 

A week later my sister decides to get back with James. I was furious. I sent her a text that said she is choosing to continue the cycle of abuse and that what she is doing is not healthy for her daughter. (I also said “you keep shoveling shit back into your life and then wondering why it smells shitty. My niece deserves a stable home.) but that was the worst of what I sent her. She said I was being an asshole and that she didn’t deserve to have me say these things to her and calling her a bad mom. 

I understand abuse victims often go through the cycle several times, but my mother and I have been giving her help and aid with books, journals, offering to pay for therapy and she won’t do it. We just want a healthy life for my niece, but AITA for what I said to her??

"AITA for stranding a date without a ride because she was ignoring me?. So last weekend I went on a tinder date with a girl who I’ve been chatting to for a while. It was our second date and I thought things were going pretty well.

We end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which I recommended. It was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. I awkwardly try to join in but I’m basically ignored. I leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. They’re still chatting. I stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. They back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

At this point I go out and grab a smoke. She comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn’t seen this guy in ages. I tell her that’s cool but I’m just gonna head home soon. She asks me to wait for her bc she doesn’t have a ride and it’s far from home. 

So I wait bc whatever, night is ruined and I might as well just hang out. I wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her I’m going home and she can either come with me or stay. I see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. I try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. I gesture to her that I’m going and she holds up a finger like “wait a minute” and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. 

I’ve had it at this point and I just text her “leaving now, bye” and head straight to my car and leaves. I get frantic calls about 15 min later. She asks me where I am and if I could go back and pick her up since she doesn’t have a ride and her friend doesn’t live close to her like I do. I say “no” and hang up. 

Anyways the next day I get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. She’s upset because I left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can’t get uber/lyft for some reason. She calls me a POS and to never call her again and that she’ll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me. 

My roommate and his gf both agreed that the girl sucks, but they think I should’ve just waited longer and made sure she got home. AITA for what I did?",NTA.

"AITA for asking to go first in a line?. Hi so this is a throwaway account and this situation has just been bothering me since yesterday and I wanted to get some other opinions.

So for background, I am a sophomore transfer student at a university and yesterday was my second day of classes. I’m still figuring out how everything works here and where everything is, and yesterday I had a class at 3:30pm and needed to pick up my book before because the store closed at 4pm because I needed it for homework. I had 10 minutes to get to class and I was a decent distance away and so I explained and asked a group of 3 friends in front of me if I could go before them to pick up my textbook I ordered online. They said yes, but then afterwards chatting among themselves they were laughing and one of the guys said “I have an interview in 4 days, maybe I should cut the line”. I felt bad after hearing that but I was just really worried about being late and not getting my book to finish the assignment due that night before the store closed.

"WIBTA for asking if my husband is invited to a wedding? For not attending? For attending?. EDIT: So I am really dumb and typed in my maiden last name that I usually still go by. Oooops. It lets anyone register as a guest so that was weird. I typed in my married name and poof-I have a second guest! Oops! I honestly was a little in disbelief when I thought he wasn't invited because the bride is a very thoughtful and wonderful person who would not just exclude my husband.  I am still glad to hear your responses because I did not see enough recent info on this issue when I googled it. Opinions on this seems divisive. 

&#x200B;

Original post:

I received a save the date for a wedding. It was from a friend that lives across the country and possibly didn't expect that I would come. However, we do visit that city every summer (my husband's family is from there) and because I got the save the date, I planned the trip around the wedding date so we could attend. Today I got the official invitation and only I am invited, but not my spouse of 5 years. She has met my spouse many times but they are not close. They get along fine though. I am guessing that she doesn't have enough space or doesn't want to pay for an additional meal, especially if she wasn't expecting me to come. However, I know the venue minimum is 100 guests so it's not a very small wedding. I have a couple friends going who's SOs are invited, and I have not heard of anyone else's spouse being excluded.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I clarified with the bride that my husband is not invited? It could possibly be oversight but he was not in the online system. It could have been me messing up the save the date but I think all I had to do was enter my mailing address so I'm not sure that's possible. I'm not sure if it would be rude to inquire.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I didn't attend if he's not invited? WIBTA to my husband if I did attend? I will have friends there and although they will have their SOs, I'm sure I would still have a good time if I went.

"AITA for not defending my friend ?. I've diagnosed with Social Anxiety for quite some time now. This has made my life difficult in many ways, I have a hard time talking to people , especially if the situation is confrontational. I've also been good friends with a girl since the first grade, that we'll call her Amy. Many people find her annoying since she is so talkative. So, one day during a class I was sitting next to some people who weren't very fond of Amy. They started making fun of her and the way she talked. I couldn't find my voice to stand up for her so I just stayed silent. Amy was sitting at the table over with a friend of hers and they overheard everything and saw that I didn't say anything. She ignored me for the rest of the day, but when the day was over and we were leaving school, she came up to me with the same friend. They asked me why I didn't stand up for her and I told her that I couldn't find my voice to speak up. When they heard that they raised their voices at me and started to tell me that I used my anxiety as an excuse and I should just get over it. I was hurt to hear that and I didn't know what to do so, I told the entire story to some of my personal friends and they were furious. They later picked a fight with Amy, and she was enraged, she asked me why I would tell anyone about the encounter, I told her that I was hurt and I needed to talk to someone.

"AITA for voice recording my coworker who has a bad temper?. 
I work in software and I generally like my coworkers but I had one coworker who has a poor temper. He is able to control it if in front of the managers of course but he can't when he's dealing with people on his level, or less senior to him..  funny how that works.

I've learned my lesson to always get as much evidence as I can before I report something, I've had other experiences in college where failing to gather evidence basically left stuff unaddressed.

So at work, I used the audio recorder on my laptop to quietly record it when this guy started throwing a fit. I uploaded the recordings to my personal cloud storage.

And then after a month I went home and selected some of the worst parts. I put together about a minute clip.

And then I had my weekly meeting with my boss, and I told him that I was having difficulty working with AngryGuy because he does not keep his temper in check. 

I said that he'd been too aggressive about work related stuff and had bought personal insults into it. My boss said that he's noticed AngryGuy doesn't always speak the most respectfully and he'd have a talk with him. 

So I told my boss, before he had this talk, i thought there was something he should listen to so he understands the scope of the problem.

I played the audio and it wasn't a good look. It was basically a minute straight of really aggressive disrespectful behavior. I could tell he was shocked to hear it... And hear it go on and on.

 I told my boss afterwards that I'd been subject to all that in just the last month, and that kind of language or tone was not something I wanted to hear again. 

He asked me what I'd need to consider things resolved. I said that I'd need AngryGuy to gain full control of his temper and not speak that way to me or in front of me again. And if that was not possible, I would want added restrictions on how we could meet; he could not meet with me behind closed doors, all of our meetings would be conducted at tables in the public atrium. If that did not influence his behavior for the better, I would want all of our meetings to either be done over email or with a manager present. 

My boss noted all that and went to speak to HR then to AngryGuy. And apparently they resolved things by moving him off the team onto a project where he would be the only software developer.

I was relived by that, but it's caused a bit of stress on the team. A couple people liked working with AngryGuy because of his smarts, and are annoyed I got him off the team. Plus a couple people think that recording him was dirty and underhanded. 

AITA for how I handled things ay work?","I want to say NTA because he was creating a hostile work environment, but do be careful as recording people without their consent is illegal in a lot of places.

"AITA for not wanting to meet my biological mom/sisters?. Hello reddit, this is a question that keeps bugging me that I need an outside perspective to. It’s going to be pretty lengthy so bare with me. TIA. 

I’m a 21 female, this all started around my 13 birthday. A week before to be exact. I started receiving these messages from a woman on Facebook claiming to be my mother with the additional “the woman who you call mom isn’t your real mom”, how she loved me, etc. I always ignored them because I had no idea who she was or thought she had the wrong person (stupid, I know” I never brought it up to my parents (adoptive) and just let it be. We took a trip to the upper states in the summer and I shared this with my cousin who then went and told my parents. My parents weren’t happy nor would they tell me why. They kept it from me till we got home and they wanted to see the messages that I’d received, I gave it to them. They accused me of messaging this lady back even though I never did. 

Later that day my dad sat me down outside and explained what was going on. That the lady who had messaged me was my biological mother and the story behind it. According to him she was sprung out on drugs, gave birth, and left me in the hospital with no record of who she was. The hospital didn’t know what to do so they tried to find someone who would take me in or else I’d be in foster care. My adoptive parents are a cousin from my mother’s side and her husband. During the court date, that she never showed up to, ordered her to have zero contact with me as there’s a warrant (not sure if it’s still active as this happened in ‘98) out for her arrest. 

Against my better judgement, I eventually started talking to my bio mother out of sheer curiosity, much to the dismay of my adoptive mom who doesn’t like her at all, especially the way she went about trying to get into contact with me. My bio mom started how sorry she was, how she found god and how she would like to meet up. I asked for time to think it over. She said it was fine. It has been years and I’m afraid that if I haven’t started wanting to do it now, then I won’t ever want to. Over the course of these years she done nothing but try and get into contact with me through making multiple Facebook accounts, pretending to be someone else, even getting my biological sisters to try and talk to me. One has recently reached out yet again, and I wouldn’t put it past her to have forced her to do it. The efforts are met with static on my side and frustration. I understand the need to want to meet me but trying to force my hand isn’t going to help the situation either. 

I’m stuck. I really don’t want to meet her, I want to forget any of this ever happened/is happening. But at the same time a small part of me will regret it immensely.

"AITA for cancelling on my friend because I found out we were going to a strip club?. I’ve known my friend Joe for about 6 years now. We clicked in the beginning, and know pretty much everything about each other. I went through some shit when I was a kid, so I have some triggers. Basically I have issues when it comes to sex, especially strip clubs. 

Joe knows this, and he’s always been considerate with things like that. He’s more the party type, and frequents strip clubs/bars/etc. I don’t drink either (I’m the uncool friend lol) so he never invites me when he goes to bars or strip clubs. 

Anyways, a month or so ago he invited me to go do something for his birthday, with some other friends. I of course said yes. He planned for us to go to this restaurant that has some cool things to do, kind of a party restaurant/bar. As I’ve said I’m not great with bars but it’s his birthday so I was just planning on being the DD. 

The morning of the party, I texted him to confirm the address of the place. He sent me the address of a strip club. I thought that must not be right, so I texted him. The convo went kinda like this: 

Me: hey so I noticed the address you sent me was a strip club, did you send the wrong one because I thought we were just going to eat at (restaurant)

J: we’ll meet at the club then go out for food later.

M: I can’t do a strip club

J: Come on its one night. You never go and i just want to do this with my friends for my birthday.

M: sorry but I can’t. I can meet you for dinner though if that’d be ok?

He didn’t respond for about an hour and then texted “just don’t bother”. He didn’t answer my texts after that. 

My gf said I was an asshole by canceling on the day of the party and that I upset him on his birthday, but I’m not sure if I was wrong. He took me to a strip club as a “surprise” for my birthday a few years ago, knowing my history, and I had the worst panic attack, so it’s not like he doesn’t know how I feel about them.

"AITA for vetoing the theme my sister wants for her daughter's birthday party?. My sister is a single mother of a 4 year old daughter who we will call Carolina. My struggles financially because the father is a deadbeat, she didn't get to finish university, and was quite young when she had Carolina. I earn a good income and love my niece so do things like pay for her nice birthday parties and presents, and take her and my sister places. 

This time, my sister wants a circus themed party for the 5th birthday party in March (early, but we have to start booking stuff now). At the place we have it at, it gets decorated with the theme and there are a couple of people who dress up for the theme and come entertainment, and there is a cake, and a huge indoor play centre for the kids.

"AITA for wanting to keep 5 yo’s room as a cat room?. We live in a 3 bedroom house that was originally a 2 bedroom. The 3rd bedroom was originally an attic so not only is it huge, it’s the only room on the 2nd floor. The other 2 bedrooms downstairs are also pretty big. 


We have 3 daughter/ 5 yrs old and 2.5 year old twins. The plan was to make the upstairs room our 5 yr olds and have the twins share the room on the first floor. However, we decided to have all 3 of them share for the first few months while we adjust to the new house. In their room they have a bunk bed that is a full size on the bottom + a toddler bed so they each have beds of their own if they choose. However, the twins sleep on the full size bed together every night. The 5yo either sleeps with them or sleeps on the top bunk. 


We have 4 cats and for the time being, they’ve taken over the upstairs bedroom. They like to hang out there so we put all of their cat trees and whatnot up there. We don’t have a tv or any electronics up there so it’s just a nice little quiet place we can go to read books and pet the kitties.


Now my husband is saying we should start setting the room up for 5 yo. We talked to 5yo and she doesn’t want to sleep up there. She wants to stay in the room with her sisters.


I say we should just leave the girls in that room until they are tired of sharing and keep the upstairs room as a cat room for now. 


My husband doesn’t agree. He thinks it’s silly to have a cat room when we have 3 kids sharing 1 room. He thinks we should have the upstairs room set up as 5yo’s room so she’s encouraged to sleep up there. 



AITA for thinking we should just keep it as a cat room?","NTA. I like your plan a lot. If all the kids are ok with it, then let them stay together. The 5yo is too young to care about getting her own room. She will care in a few years when she hits her teen years, but that's a conversation for when SHE starts to feel the need for own space.

From the 5yo's perspective, I can see why she wants to stay in the room with her sisters. She probably already occasionally feels left out of the relationship because her only two sisters are twins, as opposed to all the three of them being triplets. Staying in a room with them is way more fun as a 5yo, and is a way for her to stay connected to them and feel less like an outsider in the sibling relationship.

Moving her upstairs to the attic might hurt at this age more than it would help because EVERYONE else is on the ground floor. She is too young to understand 'the need' for her own room. From her perspective, moving her out now will feel like getting kicked prematurely out of a slumber party everyone else (including the parents) is in on and make her feel isolated (even if though this is not the intention)

"AITA for cutting my son's hair against his wishes?. So the buzzcut thread got me thinking. I generally let my boys (10 and 12) make their own decisions on hair, clothes, etc. Older son has always wanted very short cuts which I'm fine with. Younger son on the other hand, wants his hair long in the front, like a skater do or something. Initially I was fine with that and let him grow it out, just helping to keep the sides trimmed and it somewhat even. Up until a month ago, it had grown so the gront part was about to the tip of his nose.

He's in 5th grade, and has been having some problems with school this year. We've been called in for several conferences to talk about his behavior and sometimes defiance toward his teacher. One of the things that she said he was doing was flipping his hair down over his eyes when she was teaching or trying to talk to him so she couldn't see his face. I know my son and this was definitely a defiance/disrespect thing.

So, I talked to him about it, and said if he was going to use his hair to be disrespectful to his teacher, then he wasn't going to be allowed to have that haircut anymore. I cut it to a similar style, short on sides, longer on top/front, but a lot shorter so that it only reached his eyebrows. No more flipping it over his face.

He was a little mad but not too upset.  I told him that when he's a little older and more mature maybe he can grow it out again. I'm in favor of letting kids make decisions on their own things within reason, but I think I had the right to make him get it cut since he was using it in this  way.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I should probably clarify timelines here. This didn't happen in one day, as in, teacher called and I immediately hacked his hair off. I had been talking to him about it before because he does the same thing to me, and his teacher had previously said his hair was distracting to him as he'd play with it instead of paying attention.

When we had the conference, I talked to him about being disrespectful and said that if he kept doing the hair thing in class, we'd have to cut it. It was maybe a week after that when it actually got cut, after the behavior continued.

Edit 2: This hairstyle is close to his ""before"" haircut. I cut the front hanging part to about eyebrow level, and trimmed the rest to even it up. It was not a drastic style change, just getting it out of his eyes/face.

It's definitely been affecting me for nearly an entire year, but it really got bad at the start of this school year. The car is titled in my dad's name, but I have been making payments on it every week for the past 4-5 months. I have consistently been an A-B student, despite the issues with ADHD.

My parents recently found out that I have been doing pretty bad in school, and despite me telling them for the past few months that I've really been trying my hardest and school but it's just not been working, they chalked it up to me just being lazy and not wanting to do the work. Only recently did they realize it was so bad when I freaked out and couldn't go to school one day, and they got me a therapist, who told them that I have serious depression. My teachers said that I had the break to get my make up work done, and I really struggled to complete it, mostly due to my parents misunderstanding of depression and adhd. I managed to get most of it done, except for a few assignments in one of my classes. I started my medication only a few days ago, on the last day of the break, and I could already tell that it was helping a ton, yet my parents said that due to me not completing all my assignments over break, they were going to sell my car. I know that if they do that, that things would get much worse, because I have to be able to drive to my job and still go out with friends, which I've figured out is a big contributing factor in my depression. I just want to know if I'm the asshole for saying I should keep my car, because it's not the reason that I've been unable to get my work done.",NTA.

"AITA for ghosting this person who seems disinterested?. A few days ago, I began talking to someone with the intention from both of us that we were interested in finding someone on a romantic level, possibly each other. Ever since the very first few messages, their side has been bland. The conversations feel more like an interview or AMA than a conversation of two people trying to get to know one another and it’s bothered me somewhat.

>Me: What kind of TV shows do you enjoy?

>Them: Rick and Morty.


With something like this, I'll reply with

>I love that show too! I particularly liked the episode of Season 3 where... What was your favorite moment from the show?

With their response being something like

>I liked Season 2 Episode 7.

There never seems to be anything to build off and they hardly ever asking me any questions, not even so much as a ""you?"" on most occasions. Just feels like they’re not interested but keeping the conversation going to be nice.

They sent me something recently and it’s another one of these where I asked a question, elaborated a bit on something from my own life, and they answered my question and didn’t mention anything about what I had said and they took hours to send it. I feel like, they’re not interested and there’s no point in keeping this going and I feel like not responding any longer because it's honestly feeling like a waste of my time and energy and theirs as well.

Am I the/an asshole here for doing this? Just no longer replying?","It’s not ghosting if you stop *initiating* conversation

"WIBTA if I called out someone for being a sucky secret sister?. I’m in a MOPs group and I’m in a leadership position, it was decided by our Cordinator that we do secret sisters for each other. Basically once a month you get your secret sister a $10 or less gift, it was stated that we could even just write the person a thoughtful note and mail it to them. So far I have gifted 9 items to my person. And I have only received 3 from my own. I spoke to the Cordinator around Christmas time because I had only received one item and she put out in our group chat that it is suppose to be a monthly thing and we have had reminders at all of our meetings. 
I am very hurt and disappointed. I’m trying not to take it personally but it’s kind of hard not to when I see everyone else get fun thoughtful gifts at their table and I again have nothing. I wonder if it’s because I’m one of the youngest moms, does she think I’m obnoxious, the potential friendship isn’t even worth it? I have tried every hard to put a lot of thought and care into the gifts I give, digging beyond the questionaire we all filled out. I get to so excited to give mine each month.

I ask her ""Whose your favorite president?""

""Hmm. It would have to be JFK, Ben Franklin, and Obama in that order.""

""Oh, but Ben Franklin wasnt president.""

""What?""

""He wasn't president. He was a founding father though and its a mistake a lot of people make.""

""Maybe its a mistake that you made? Because I guarantee you he was.""

""No, he really wasn't im serious."" I think its still light so I laugh.

""Ok, one sec."" She smirks and reaches into her purse/wallet thing and pulls out a 100 dollar bill.

""Who does that look like to you?""

""Ben Franklin?""

""Ha, there you go!""

I now realize she thinks you need to be a president to be on dollar bill.

""You know Hamilton wasnt president and is on a bill?""

""Google it! Google it!"" She shouts in like a fed up laughing tone.

"AITA for lashing out on my passive aggressive older sister?. I am a 20 year old male, full-time college student and currently unemployed as I am fortunate enough to go to school with a full scholarship. My sister is 28 with a one year old daughter whom my family and I both love dearly. I love my sister and she is great but she has had a history of saying things in a rather passive aggressive/condescending manner. I'm not easily offended and am usually unaffected by what she says, but today I flipped out. She and my oldest brother live in their own house, while my second older brother, little brother, and I live with our parents. Our parents are currently away on vacation with their granddaughter (sister's baby), and my second older brother was also away on vacation. So most of this weekend it was my little brother and I just staying home watching the house while my sister and oldest brother stayed at their own house/did their own thing.

Second older brother was supposed to come home from vacation yesterday and originally my sister was supposed to pick him up from the airport. However, something came up and she couldn't do so. We (me, sis, oldest bro, lil bro) are chilling at parents house the night my second oldest bro is supposed to arrive (plane would land late into the night). My sister asked me if I could pick him up instead, which I said yes to. However when she asked me this, she passive aggressively included the point that I did not do anything all weekend so I SHOULD pick him up from the airport. The first time she asked me this I didn't think much of it, I simply agreed to pick him up from the airport as she was right, I did not do anything this weekend and I had no plans/work as I'm unemployed. As the night goes on she repeatedly asks me in that passive-aggressive tone if I could pick him up from the the airport always including the ""because what did you do all weekend?"" point. Eventually, I get a little mad and I ask her why she has to include that point. She then asks me why I got mad and that I took her question the wrong way (which maybe I did.) My two brothers also ask her why she needs to include that point when asking the question. My oldest brother and I start lashing out on her (oldest brother and sis got into a fight the night before, possibly also because of her passive-aggressive condescending tone.) She lashes back saying that we took it the wrong way and that we just don't want her at the house (which is totally untrue/unrelated to why we are mad) and storms out the house.

"WIBTA if I rejected the essential oil that my mom gave me?. Alright fellas so I’m a 17 year old dude suffering through my senior year in high school with moderate ADHD. It’s not horribly bad but I tend to be a bit jumpy and I have a hard time bringing myself to do my homework. 

Since I have trouble focusing, my grades have been suffering and I really need to graduate. I have been taking medication (vyvanse) to help me concentrate and it has helped somewhat. My mom is still worried however so she came home today with a little surprise for me. 

I know my mom loves me very much and I love her with all my heart but she tends to be very serious so we are at odds a lot with her constantly getting on my ass. Tonight, however, she came home very excited and smiling (not usual behavior) and told me that she had something for me. I just had a gut feeling that it was gonna be an essential oil and sure enough, she pulled out a big ass bottle of intune by doterra which is some kind of oil that is supposed to help me focus. 

I look at her in disbelief for a moment but her smile made me so happy and I appreciated that she thought of me and genuinely wanted to help so I accepted her gift with only a slight hint of skepticism. I really don’t believe in this stuff but I’m not particularly against essential oils existing. I honestly don’t really care and I think they smell nice. 

I know doterra is an MLM and essential oils are kind of worthless but I feel like I would be a prick if I brought that up to my mom after she paid almost fifty dollars for one bottle. She did it out of love in the end and it’s not gonna kill me to roll some smelly shit on me when I start homework. I feel like I would be an asshole if I spat in her face by telling her I didn’t believe in it and rejecting her gift but I want to hear your points of view because I’m just kind of in a state of cringe at the moment.

"AITA my brothers destination wedding and the following party. So my brother and his fiance are getting married in Mexico next spring. His fiance said she wants the Mexican wedding because she has a list of people she wants to come and doesn't want too offend people she doesn't invite. So basically it's her way of politely not inviting people. 

I will likely end up a groomsman because my brothers friends can't afford to go so it will likely be me and maybe one other guy there for him. It's going to cost about 5k for myself, my gf and out daughter to go, unfortunately the date they picked falls a month after my daughter turns two so she doesnt get to go for free. 

Turns out now his bride has decided to have a party for all those uninvited. Which turns out again to be another trip. This one will only be a few hours by car away but will end up costing us about 1k to 1500 for a weekend gathering. I'm expected to go since I'll be in the wedding party in Mexico and I flat out told them I can't afford it so we won't be going.

About a month ago, my 10yr old daughter brought us the her choir schedule for 2020 and we saw she had two performances the week of our trip. We figured she would miss the performances, but over the past couple of weeks, my daughter has voiced that she really wanted to perform. My wife said that was fine and she could push our vacation out to President's day weekend so the kids miss less time from school. We still did not have a destination set in stone but Florida was looking to be a possibility. Around this time, I FaceTimed with my parents and grandma who live in Texas. They were at the hospital as my grandma had recently fallen and was about to go in for surgery. It was kind of hard on her as she is bipolar, and is dealing with early stages of dementia so she didn't completely understand everything that was going on. It was hard seeing her like that and I broke down crying once I got off the call. My wife felt bad and said we can take our family trip to Texas to see my parents and grandma since we've never been down to visit them, and it's warmer than where we live. My parents and I don't have the best relationship, so I said that would be nice so long as we didn't spend more than a couple of days visiting them. We also discussed going to other cities as well in Texas to do sightseeing with our kids along with maybe hitting up a beach. We started researching and looking at places to go, but today my wife let me know she's not looking forward to the trip. I knew she wasn't looking forward to seeing my parents as she gets along with them less than I do. I asked her if it was just because of my parents, and she said because from the start the vacation was supposed to be for her birthday but now it's a trip to go see my family. She then said, to not be surprised if she acted like a bitch her whole birthday weekend and during our vacation. To put in perspective, she's a ""when momma's not happy, ain't nobody happy"" kind of person.

"AITA for approaching a police officer to ask for directions?. Hi all!

I’ve created a throwaway account as I’d rather not have any of these personal details linked to my main. 

For context, I am 24F. I’m quite tiny, I weigh 46kg and am about 5ft exactly. Not what I would assume would be an intimidating presence. 

Onto the story:
Last weekend, my sister and I, and a group of our friends travelled a few hours to another city to celebrate the long weekend. (I live in Australia). 

On the Saturday night, I somehow got separated from my friend group and started to try and walk back to where we were staying (which wasn’t far). I didn’t have my debit card with me as my partner had kept it in his pocket for the night so I wouldn’t lose it. All I had was my ID and my phone. I wasn’t sure if I had enough money on my card to order an Uber either. 

I am (in general), terrible with directions and took a wrong street. I don’t live in this city either so I’m not overly familiar. As I was walking I saw a police officer ahead. I decided I’d (politely) ask him for help/to point me in the right direction of where I was trying to get to. 

Before I could even get any words out, he held his hand in my face and yelled at me to “back the fuck up and get away from him”.  So I did. I immediately turned around and walked the other direction. However, it really rattled me to the point of having a panic attack. I got so hysterical and couldn’t calm down so I got even more lost. 

I’ve never approached a police officer for anything thus far in my life. I realise just needing directions is trivial and not really in their job description. However, the officer had no idea what I was approaching him with. As someone who has been s**ually ass*ulted in the past, it really pissed me off that he would be so rude and, in my opinion, aggressive. I really don’t think I’d ever feel comfortable or safe in approaching an officer for anything again, to be honest. 

I don’t know if I had actually done anything wrong though. I had been drinking but I wasn’t incoherent, slurring or stumbling. I was fine until he yelled at me at which point triggered something in me and I became panicked.

So the story: My friend just graduated from college and got a job at a different state. I was /am very happy for him and I wanted to celebrate with him. I asked him to hang out and originally we were going to go fishing, but he had to stay late and we ended up meeting in the afternoon. After a few minutes we did a coin toss on who was driving and it was him. We went to the first bar and ate, then we moved to a second bar had a few beers and left to go to the 3rd bar. Here is where it gets stupid.

We stayed in this bar for a while. I kept buying drinks and everything was on me. I'm not gonna lie, I drank way more than I could handle, we met some dude and he started drinking with us and I remember was me smoking a cigarette with them. I then browned out..... and when I woke up in a car, the dude on the passenger seat and then my buddy on the driver seat. I thought everything was okay until I heard ""yes, officer."" I was stunned, I didn't know what to do. I was also very drunk at this moment and started throwing up... A lot. At this moment the dude in the passenger seat told the officer that I was very sick and he needed to get me out. the dude pulled me to the side of the street away from view( i think) and I proceeded to vomit everywhere.... I asked him about my friend and told him I did not want to leave. But he insisted and told me that if I stay I would just get him in more trouble and get in trouble myself. Me being drunk, I got scared and just went with him. The dude got his friend ( or maybe his girlfriend) to pick us up and told me that I should fill up her car since they were helping me get home and I did it, it would be the same price for an uber anyway.

I got home, I tried contacting his family but my phone died and it had throw up on it and I was not able to charge it due to moisture. I tried to instagram message his brother. I tried for an hour or so but I was so drunk I couldn't even log in to my instagram. I then passed out and I woke up sober, panicking that I FUCKING LET MY BEST FRIEND SLEEP IN JAIL. I then called the jail to pay his bail or get him out, but they informed me that he was going to be released in a few hours.

"AITA for suddenly ending a friendship?. In July I went on a road trip with my friend and we spent 2 stressful days in the car to get to San Jose. When we finally got to the Airbnb we got into our first fight. She called me really awful names, implied that I was crazy for having feelings about the way she treated me in the car, and insisted that the only reason I felt that way was because I was overtired and hungry. At one point during the fight she charged at me like she was going to physically attack me.

We decided to make up and continue the trip. I did have to set some boundaries with her. I told her I don't find name calling acceptable and explained that this is because it tells me ""I don't respect you, your opinions, or your feelings."" She argued that it's not that big of a deal because her boyfriend puts up with it but that she'd ""work on it.""

2 months ago we landed in another fight. She works in a salon and sometimes ordered haircare products for me at a steep discount. I had already given her the money for 2 products but every time we met up she forgot them. After a month and a half of waiting for them, she agreed that the next time I was coming into town I would let her know the night before so she could tell me where and when would be a good time to meet up during the day.

I texted her around 11pm, figuring she was asleep and would see it in the morning. By 10:30 the next morning I hadn't heard back so I texted her asking if it just wasn't a good day. She responded by telling me the next several days she wouldn't be home until later, so I offered to venmo her some money so she could ship them to me. I apologized for potentially misunderstanding the plan we had previously agreed to.

She read my texts as being passive aggressive (definitely not my intention but I can see it). She started to say and imply hurtful things about me and my unemployment, and how it wasn't her fault that she's busy. At one point she said ""I thought you were going to tell me when you were coming into town next"" which I absolutely did.

I then told her that I was getting tired of her treatment of me. She responded by saying ""oh fuck you."" I told her that that was unacceptable to say to me. She proceeded to tell me the world doesn't revolve around me, she doesn't have to be available to me 24/7, and that she's tired of hearing about things in my life.

After the ""fuck you"" and making it clear she doesn't want to hear about my life, I decided our friendship was over. I told her I felt like she didn't see me as a friend and clearly never did if that's how she feels. Before she replied I blocked her number and blocked her on social media.

I'm wondering if I made a mistake in how hastily I shut the door on this friendship. I feel like I'm the asshole for burning this bridge with no warning and without giving her a chance to discuss whether or not the relationship was something to save.

"AITA for getting annoyed at the way my mum handles my sister?. I've not said anything to my mum about this but I am tempted to.


My sister is a toddler, and as such has the usual temper tantrums and is a little gremlin for bedtime. My mum is nearing 50, going through menopause and perhaps not the most patient of people.


I am a first grade teacher. The way I handle kids is by using positive reinforcement and positive language to guide them away from negative behaviour. It's also the way I handle my sister.

My sister never misbehaves for me and as such I look after her the majority of the time- as soon as I get in from work and all weekend, but mum does bedtimes every night. If sister doesn't want to go to bed she will have a tantrum, and mum's response is to shout while standing at full height (only about 5'5 so not too tall, but tall to a kid) in an attempt to intimidate sister into doing as she's told, whereas when I do bedtime I just say it's bedtime now, take her hand, put her in the bed with her bunny and tuck her back in.

"AITA for calling my girlfriend stupid for putting herself in potentially dangerous situations?. So my girlfriend is an avid stoner. She's been in many situations where she goes to parks and forested areas alone, sometimes in pitch black darkness to smoke. In many of these situations, she's been approached by creepy guys or shady characters who she says herself made her extremely uncomfortable. I've gotten mad in the past at her for putting herself in those situations and she just acts clueless as if nothing bad can go wrong.

Today, she was in her car rolling by a forest and a dude in a car drives by 2 or 3 times. After driving by a couple of times he knocks on her window and asks her for some rollies, she gave him a couple and he left. She told me that he was being creepy and I kind of got pissed at her since she even rolled the window down considering the guys' creepy behaviour. She then told me that the guy was parked a couple of cars down just sitting there, and then she went into the forest to blaze. At some point the guy got out the car and started following her, she said she walked down the path and got out later on.

Now here's the AITA part. I got frustrated due to me having to keep bringing this conversation up. (I've had this conversation with her multiple times in a manner where I was staying calm) I called her stupid for putting herself in potentially dangerous situations over and over again. I told her she needs to smarten the fuck up and learn to recognize dangerous situations, and that I've told her this in the past and she's putting her safety at risk. She then proceeded to call me an asshole and rude for saying that to her. She then acted oblivious to the potential danger she put herself into. So reddit, AITA?","NTA.

A group of friends planned a beach trip for a three day weekend. We booked a house big enough for 13 people and everyone had to pay an equal portion. Right before we left, 2 people pulled out. The first was a girl who had a medical emergency and ended up being hospitalized—nothing major but obviously she couldn’t come. The second was a boy who decided after agreeing to come on the trip and paying for everything to be in a show with tech week during the time we were away.

"WIBTA if I turned down a full ride to college?. I'm seventeen and planning on attending college this fall. I've heard from all my prospective colleges and received nearly all my final financial aid packages. Most offered me decent aid, but not enough to avoid taking on major debt/loans (cheapest college is asking for about $35,000 a year). Aside from their price, however, I can see myself attending any of them happily.

I'm a closeted transgender person from the rural south,  and I'm hoping that college can give me an opportunity to be who I am in an accepting environment. All the out-of-state schools I've been admitted to are very welcoming to LGBT students, with ample accommodations for people like me. They even cover hormone therapy for students on their insurance plans, which is a resource I'll definitely be in need of.

To appease my parents, I applied to one of their picks, an in-state university (U) that I wasn't planning on attending. My parents, albeit disappointed, were understanding. However, things changed when U offered me a full ride for four years.

Normally, I would be overjoyed, but U has a history of being anti-LGBT, and its location in the deep south doesn't provide much of an escape from campus. U doesn't have student LGBT resources outside a blanket non-discrimination statement and a defunct GSU (gay students union), and from what I've seen from visits and research, ""trannys"" aren't treated very well. Of course, I don't have the complete picture, considering I'm going off of observations from the internet and brief visits, but nonetheless, the contrast between what I've heard about U and the other colleges to is night and day. I was able to find all the aforementioned information about the out-of-state colleges in a few minutes, whereas U's LGBT information is all but hidden. 

My parents, while pushing for me to go to U, insisted they would help cover costs no matter where I went, as they know firsthand how difficult payment can be. I've tried talking them out of it, but they won't hear any of it. I'm incredibly thankful for their generosity, and I feel very guilty for considering options that would require them to pay. I want to talk to them about the issue, but I come from a very traditional Southern Baptist home, so I'm unable to talk to my parents without outing myself/making the situation worse.

I know I'll have to face transphobia wherever I go, but I was hoping college could be a safe space where I could freely express my identity. But, I feel horrible that my parents would pay for college when I have an option to go for free. Would I be an asshole if I turned down the full ride anyway?

"AITA for not inviting my friend’s homofobic boyfriend to my lesbian wedding?.  Hi everyone!

Basically my wife (26F) and I (27F) got married last September. I’ve got this group of friends (5 people) that comes a long way, since we were about 12 years old. After this long, some of us started getting married, having kids, etc.

One of these friends (26F) has an idiot of a boyfriend (33M), for about 3 years now, and they have a kid with a year and a half. I say he is an idiot because he is the women-must-stay-at-home (and my friend does stay at home) and I’m-always-right kind of guy. Also, he has shown to be against LGBT community, even in front of me, to the point that he and one of my friends, that was defending me, kept fighting for hours about it, while I just left, knowing that it wouldn’t make any difference to try and have a conversation with him about same-sex relationships.

When the time came to prepare invitations to the wedding and we had to define how many people and who to invite to the wedding my then girlfriend and I had a debate on whether we should invite this boyfriend. From our point of view it didn’t make sense to invite someone who was openly against what we were about to do – getting married - and it felt unfair to have LGBT community fighting and even dying for our rights in order for us to invite someone homophobic to the wedding out of courtesy. Also, we wanted to avoid any kind of awkward situations, i.e. he drinking too much and saying anything stupid.

In the end, we decided not to invite the boyfriend. I had a talk with my friend, explained the situation, how we felt about it and said that I would like her to go to the wedding regardless because she was important to me.

She made her decision of not going. In her view, he is not homophobic and they work as one – if he was not going, then she wouldn’t either. I said even though it made me said, I totally understood it and there were no hard feelings.

"WIBTA if I didn’t pay cleanout/damage fees charged over a year after move out?. Title is pretty self explanatory, but I’ll elaborate on some details.  

I lived in a house for a year and a half until just over a year ago when I moved states for school. There was never a lease.  I lived there with another tenant, the landlord and her spouse (she’s only a couple years older than I, I’m 29F).   It wasn’t the greatest environmental due to her very passive aggressive nature at times and her and her new husbands constant screaming matches, but it was what I could afford.  

Anyhow, I had to move out while she was out of town for a couple days. I will admit that especially in the last few months I was there I wasn’t the most pleasant to her-I actively avoided her. I’m also a bit messy by nature. I also had a small dog which she allowed. 

We had a falling out just before she left, and after I moved we never spoke.  However, yesterday I got a Venmo charge for $300 in clean out fees and a text saying she needed to charge me for damages and cleaning she had to do.  The damage was due to three nail holes in the wall for the bookcase-it was assembled for me and I didn’t realize they did that till it was done but still. I know I didn’t deep clean or anything but the room was fairly clean upon leaving. 

Now, if she had been present during my move out or had her husband inspect then. (He was home) and charged me, or even told me of this shortly after her return, I would have accepted the fee. However, it’s been OVER A YEAR.  She lives there.  I think it’s ridiculous to charge this now-if she really wanted it, she should’ve done this a year ago. Additionally, due to rumors and also how things were when I lived there, I suspect she’s broke and possibly getting divorced and is trying to get cash where she can. 

I haven’t responded yet, I’m tempted to block her and the Venmo request and not pay.  WIBTA if I do this? 

Tl;dr: charged for damage for a place I lived in with no lease over a year after move out by private landlord:suspecting it’s a way to get cash cash

"WIBTA if i told my friends fiancée she doesn’t want to marry him?. I (23F) met my friend (“Julie”) and her fiancé (“Joe”) last summer when I was starting a school program with Julie. Julie and Joe are both in their thirties, and got engaged shortly before moving to the city that we live in. They are having their wedding early next year. 

Last fall, we began noticing that Julie didn’t seem to really enjoy being around Joe whenever we were out. She would seem to actively avoid him, talk to our other male friends frequently, and get pretty touchy with them. She kissed one of our friends one night out, but nothing was ever said to her as no one else saw and it was just so bizarre. Shortly after this, my friend Sam (23F) and I found out from Julie that she had cheated on Joe (one night stand) shortly after they had moved to our city with someone we didn’t know, but deeply regretted it and felt guilty about it. At this point, Sam and I were debating having an intervention with Julie/Joe as it seemed she didn’t want to be tied down by him, but we didn’t want to butt into their relationship, and she seemed regretful of the cheating. 

Shortly after all this, we got quite busy with school, and drunk Julie seemed to calm down. She did start hanging around a guy who isn’t in our friend group and we somewhat suspect she was cheating on Joe with him (saw them grabbing coffee, hanging out), but we have no concrete evidence that anything occurred between them. He seemed cold to her last month when we were all at a party together, so if anything was happening, we suspect it’s over now.

So for the past 8ish months, everything has seemed great with Julie and Joe. They’re excited about their wedding, and Julie wasn’t getting nearly as touchy or doing anything suspect at the few parties we’ve had. Then this past weekend, we were all at a house party, and Julie got quite drunk. She was very touchy and complimentary towards the friend she had kissed in the fall (“Wow, you’re so attractive ____”). After this, while sitting at a table, Sam saw Julie put her foot on another of our friends lap and rub his crotch area with her foot for a while- all while sitting at the table next to her fiancée. Later on, that friend who she was touching had his arm around Julie, Joe saw and got upset. They had an argument where she apologized repeatedly, and then the rest of the night they were in separate rooms. 

My friend Sam and I are very apprehensive about what to do next. It’s not our business, but we feel as though Joe, who were not great friends with, should know what’s going on. It seems as though Julie is trying to get caught, with increasingly bold moves whenever she is drunk. We could outright ask Julie if she really wants to marry Joe, but we don’t think we’ll get a straight answer out of her when she’s sober.

"AITA for thinking a mentally disabled student is ruining my college games club?. **The neutral explanation**

There is a games club that I am a member of at my college. Its members consist of about 20 members, both men and women who meet about once a week (usually not all 20 at once) to play various board / table top games. Since my joining the club 2 years ago, I have risen in the ranks to being someone who helps organize the game nights now every third week or so. (The specific game I run will be discussed later). 

&#x200B;

Recently (this past semester) a student who is mentally disabled was encouraged to join the club. I was in no way opposed to his joining, because I genuinely enjoy introducing the fun of tabletop games to people. I often see people that think board games only go as far as monopoly, so its great to expand their horizons into thinks like Munchkin, Zombicide, Sycthe, etc etc. The main game that I run is Dungeons and Dragons about once or twice a month (It’s actually a different game system, but everyone knows D&D, so let’s go with that for simplicity)

&#x200B;

To describe this student (let’s call him Jim) I’d say he is not completely unable, he’s mostly just slower than the usual person and has a bit of a temper. He is often accompanied by a “buddy” around campus who helps him with stuff. He is easily upset if something doesn’t go his way. He doesn’t throw tantrums exactly, but he gets angry, loud, and very occasionally, will throw something in frustration (small objects. He doesn’t flip tables or anything). So with that explanation, you might see where this is going.

&#x200B;

Okay, so to get into the meat of my issue with Jim, I decided to split the explanation up into two versions. A simple, non-nerd version that gets the point across and a full on nerd explanation of the situation. I suggest reading the first one, but I wanted to at least write out the full version somewhere.

&#x200B;

**Non-Nerd Version**

I’ve been running a longer story with my players (5 people before Jim) for about a year and a half now. Sessions require some prep time on my part, making sure I know the player characters, where the players are planning to go, and trying to think of interesting ways to get everyone involved in the story. About mid-way through this past semester, Jim was invited into the game. We played a few practice games with him that went okay. I genuinely enjoy seeing a new player get invested in their character and come up with interesting ideas on how to progress, but issue started to arise when Jim actually joined the campaign. He wouldn’t allow his character to be hurt or be challenged in any way. This lead to parts of the game being derailed completely because his “I can’t lose” character would just effortlessly win every time because his “buddy” and other sympathetic players would insist that I “just let it slide. We’re all here to have fun and this is fun for him.” This finally boiled over in the last session before winter break where a plot twist a player and myself were building up to was “ruined” because Jim’s character pulled a “I can’t lose” move. 

&#x200B;

First and foremost, I just want everyone to have fun. I’m not going to flip the table and throw a tantrum just because the players aren’t following the story I wrote. I’ve read and seen those kinds of Dungeon Masters and that kind of behavior is embarrassing and just not fun to be around. I’m not going to just stop running the game, but I’m starting to wish I could.

&#x200B;

I’m not alone in this feeling. Two of the players also feel like the game is lesser now that Jim has joined. (one of them was part of that failed plot twist). We are quiet about it because we are concerned about being labeled as assholes for being upset over a disabled student. I used to look forward to the game sessions over winter break, but now I’m just putting together the prep work as more of a chore now. The player who had his plot twist messed up is even thinking of leaving the game since it leaves him a convenient out now.

&#x200B;

I'm mostly just curious if we are being entitled assholes for being upset over our tabletop RPG being run differently as to how we want it to be. As I said, some people are having a lot of fun, but there are others who are considering dropping out of the game entirely because it has changed so much now. 

&#x200B;

You don’t need to read the longer version below, but it does go into more explanation about me and my players specific issues.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Mentally disabled player doesn’t want to play games by the rules. Makes me and other players not want to be a part of the club anymore.

&#x200B;

**The (far too long) Nerd Version**

Before getting into Jim as a player, I’ll explain a few things about how we played our games:

&#x200B;

Okay, so as a Dungeon Master I try to get as involved with my players as I can. Each of their character’s backstories are woven into the pre-written campaign through various methods (flashbacks, custom Non Player Characters, etc) . I work with everyone individually as much as they want, through email or in person hang outs to get an idea of where they want their character to go, or even if they want to retire the character to play as a new one. (Characters are retired either through death or other plot stuff. It depends on what the player and I think will work best (This is also done rarely. We don't really allow character retirement until the character has been around awhile or, in extreme cases, the character just doesn't work for the party)

&#x200B;

The also used to run our games with a “what happens happens” kind of thing. If a character dies due to a dumb player move, then that character is dead. We try not to “ret-con” events just because a player regrets a previous move. We viewed it like being upset over an early move in chess and wanting to “go back” and undo that move so you don’t lose.

&#x200B;

Now let’s get to the issues with Jim as a player:

* Bored with my character – Jim never plays the same character twice. When we first started, I helped him make up a character. I asked what kind of character he wanted to play ( Kind of like “Do you want to me a knight with a sword, a wizard with magic, or a quick-handed thief?”). He had a lot of fun making up a character and a basic backstory for him. I was able to find a way to weave this new character into the existing plot and the first session went… okay. But then. The next session he didn’t want to play his character anymore. He wanted to play as someone else. The more sympathetic players just brushed it off, but it’s frustrating to both me and some other players that a member of the party is constantly switching out. It made everyone not want to interact with that character on a roleplaying level because he was so inconsistent.
* Everything proof shield – Jim now doesn’t allow his character to be injured in any way. Combats involving Jim’s characters are always a mess. Let’s say a goblin tries to hit him with a spear. It rolls high enough to hit, so Jim should take damage. However, Jim will say “I block it!” and will just repeat this over and over until I give up and just say something along the lines of “you manage to block the spear with your shield at the last second.” The sympathetic players will often congratulate him on his “quick thinking” and such, which again annoys the other players.
* · Unlimited Cosmic Powers – Okay so the last bullet point might really only affects his character if it stopped there, but of course it doesn’t. Jim’s character also has unlimited ability when it comes to any problem the party faces. This essentially boils down to Jim not wanting to roll dice. He just dictates what he wants his character to do and expects it to just be done. “I climb the wall. I hit him with my sword. I heal him” As a DM I usually let players police their own abilities (We look up the rules if something doesn’t feel right) but with Jim there’s just no boundaries. His character can just do *Anything* he wants without fail. Early on, I tried to play with him like usual (“You try to hit him, but he manages to nimbly doge out of your reach”) however, this lead to him getting angry and sometimes throwing game pieces or just storming off. Often leading to the sympathetic players giving me looks of disapproval and being told I should “just let him do it”.

&#x200B;

Okay so the stage is now set for what I call

&#x200B;

**The Final Straw**

I’m not going to bore you with a complete recap of the story of our campaign thus far, but to give the important details: The party was at a natural conclusion for this part of the campaign before winter break (think final episode of a season before a hiatus) and a player and I had something up our sleeve to end the session. He had been secretly planning with me for the last few months on having his character defect against the party. (A reminder, I do this with all my players. They all have backstory and character motivation that the other players don’t know, so it was a treat to have this tidbit of information under my hat for this long)

&#x200B;

We were both excited to finally drop this twist on the party and had a plan on how to do it in an interesting way. The best way I can think to explain how it was supposed to go is to just put up an outline of what we were planning.

&#x200B;

Turncoat Character (TC)

Dungeon Master (DM)

&#x200B;

Setting: A camp that party has set up at the base of a mountain several days after defeating the boss of this part of the campaign. Party consists of the 6 players and a NPC. They now have what they think is a very important item with them that is left with the NPC for plot reasons.

&#x200B;

TC: “On my turn for night watch I cast silence, targeted on center of camp” (Creates area where no sound it made) “ I make my way to the NPC’s tent and stand over him for several minutes, deciding if I should do it or not. I pull a knife from my belt and make my decision. I kill him and take the item. I walk back out into the center of camp, throwing the bloody knife away in disgust, and consider if I should leave the letter I wrote. With a shake of my head I decide its better not to try to justify myself.  I prepare to teleport to (town party visited long ago).”

&#x200B;

DM: “(Party member who had close relationship with TC), you wake up for some reason. You don’t hear anything strange, but then you realize you can’t hear anything.” (party member decides what to do. Most likely leaves their tent)

&#x200B;

“As you lift the flap you see TC preparing a teleportation spell, a bloody knife lays in the dirt nearby him.”

&#x200B;

(Let player make decision, but for simplicity lets say he goes for a tackle)

&#x200B;

TC: “I mouth the words “I’m sorry” as I vanish, dispelling the silence as I go”

&#x200B;

(Tackling player dives through empty air. Rest of the party wakes up confused to find a murder and an item stolen by a long time friend)

&#x200B;

Again apologies for the nerd here. This is a shorter hurriedly written outline to what we wanted to do, but I wanted to write it out to give context to what Jim did.

&#x200B;

So as written this was meant to be a “sequel hook” for the players and get them riled up for when we come back after winter break.

&#x200B;

But now, here’s how it actually went:

&#x200B;

**Plot Twist: Jim Edition**

(TC gets to the murder part) 

&#x200B;

Jim: “I get rid of the silence and grab TC. (Jim’s character is a non-magic fighter and his tent is across camp ie he can't dispell magic and wouldn't be able to just leap up and grab him)

&#x200B;

To shorten things here: I was guilt-ed into “just let him do it” with the grabbing and dispelling, as I planned to still let TC escape (somehow. I was going to have to improvise hard) so that our plot twist could still technically happen. But things went differently:

&#x200B;

Jim: “Why’d you kill him?”

&#x200B;

TC: “I can’t tell you. He’ll kill them if I do. (vague reference to an antagonist that party has encountered and to character backstory that hasn’t been revealed yet)

&#x200B;

Jim: “You killed NPC and now you have to die” (to DM) “I kill him”

&#x200B;

(Table starts to argue over this. Non-sympathetic players are against because this would mean Jim can just decide to kill other players while sympathetic players are for because “TC already killed someone so this makes it even”)

&#x200B;

(I try to get a combat going, so that it could still be an interesting end to the ""season"". Characters started taking sides. Was going to be a ""Captain America: Civil War"" scenario on our hands which would possibly have been more interesting... )

&#x200B;

(But I was eventually overruled by the sympathetic players who just let Jim kill TC and end the session with this mess of a scenario. TC was annoyed but kept quiet about it and the other non-sympathetic players were more visibly annoyed that rules were so blatantly ignored. They also caught on to the twist that was happening and were interested in seeing where it was going)

&#x200B;

We have talked about it since, and overall, they are all pretty pissed. None of us want to come forward with our complaints because we don’t want to be seen as assholes over this disabled student, but the way he is playing this game is derailing it for most of the players. As a DM I try to remain neutral in player arguments, but Jim is even being allowed to overrule me. Some players are still having fun, which I guess is the important thing, but it is frustrating to others to see months and months of work just be thrown away to let one person have their own fun. 

&#x200B;

I'm mostly just curious if we are being entitled assholes for being upset over our tabletop RPG being run differently as to how we want it to be. As I said, some people are having a lot of fun, but there are others who are considering dropping out of the game entirely because it has changed so much now. ","NTA. Maybe sit down with 'Jim' and his buddy and explain the importance of following the rules, and tell him flat out that his refusal to play fairly is ruining it for the other players.

"AITA for not giving my mother $1,200 “immediately”?. A little background... my mom is irresponsible with money. Always has been. It taught me to never put myself in a financially insecure position as an adult. I have a great career and make good money and my mom has taken advantage of that over the years. 

My husband, siblings, and I have all bailed her out of numerous financial pickles and given her advice to stop living beyond her means... but you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. 

Today she calls me and asks for $1,200 “immediately” to take care of bills she has fallen behind on because she does not have a job and cannot afford her rent, car payments, and other bills. I empathize with the job situation. She is a 73 year old with bad knees and a weak educational background. It’s tough. What I am struggling with is her unwillingness to come to terms about her situation and be open to longer term solutions. I can’t keep putting good money after bad. I have laid out the following: 
-She can’t afford her apartment — move in with a friend (I live five hours away from her in a state she’d be unwilling to live in, but she has a religious community she belongs to and I know they’d be accommodating to what would hopefully be a temporary situation)...
- She can’t afford her car. So she needs to turn it in/ sell it back to the dealer 
- She can’t afford food — well, she needs to swallow her pride and get to a food shelter 

Her response to all: “I don’t want to” when frankly she doesn’t have a choice! She takes my giving advice as unwillingness to give her money and gets manipulative and starts crying. 

She treats me like a bank and I’ve had enough. Never get a “hi how are you?” It’s always “I’m stressed, I need money”. 

But of course, I feel horrible for not giving her money. It’s my mom. Me not giving her money means her car will get taken away, she may get evicted and she can’t go grocery shopping. I was willing to compromise and give half now and half later and she wouldn’t take that offer.  So ultimately I decided she isn’t being fair to me and I can’t keep doing this. I am not giving her the money. 

So, AITA?","Read about the phenomenon of “parentification.”  It’s where a parent acts like the child and expects their child to be the responsible one and to fix all the parent’s own problems. It causes all sorts of anxiety. As the adult child you’re made to feel responsible for the well-being of your mom, yet you get no say over how she lives, meaning the problems continue. 

I saw something the other day that was brilliant. _You do not have to light yourself on fire just because someone else is cold._ You aren’t responsible for your mom’s problems. Period. If you want, you could help her make a plan for how she’ll address them (though I doubt she’d accept your offer), but you don’t have to give her money. It won’t fix the root problem, in fact, it prolongs it. 

Give yourself the gift of letting your mother be responsible for herself. It doesn’t make you a bad person at all. NTA.

"WIBTA if I came out to my homophobic grandparents out of spite?. I am bisexual, but am not out to my paternal grandparents, or anyone on my dad's side of the family. While I do love my grandparents a lot, they (especially my grandmother) have a habit of casually dropping homophobic views into the conversation every so often. I've been out to my parents since I was 16, and they've always told me that while my dad's side of the family will always love me, they might not understand my orientation if I were to come out. 

Last week my family and I were visiting my parents' hometown for a holiday, and we were staying with my grandparents. We were all pleasantly chatting when my grandmother derailed the conversation by talking about how a friend of theirs was justified in hiding the fact that his daughter is a lesbian, and how she is acting inappropriately and shaming her family by being open about her long-term relationship. 

My parents and sister immediately started debating my grandmother, but honestly I could hardy hear them over how loud my heart was beating. After a minute, I couldn't stay quiet and blurted out that if my boyfriend happened to be a girl, I hoped that my grandmother would treat her with all the kindness she shows to my boyfriend now. My grandmother turned to me and calmly said that if I were to hypothetically ever come out (remember, she thinks I'm straight), then she hopes that she's long dead so she doesn't have to deal with the social shame. At this point I left the room and cried for a bit, and the rest of the holiday was basically ruined for me.  

Now here's the part where I may be in the wrong. After I was done being sad, I started to feel quite angry. I can't stop thinking about this incident and others like it, and I suppose I do want to ""punish"" my grandparents for their views. My grandparents are visiting for another holiday in a few weeks, and I really want to come out to them while they're here. I know that their reaction will not be positive, and I don't care. I want them to feel upset and ashamed, the same way that they make me feel when they say homophobic things. However, this is something that I can't take back, and I'm worried that if I do come out, I'd be doing so for all the wrong reasons. I'm in a serious relationship with a man, so it's not like I need to come out for a tangible reason. I also know that my parents would be on my side, which would make for an awkward visit. Overall I'm very conflicted, and am wondering if I'm being kind of petty about the whole thing.

So Reddit, would I be the asshole if I came out to my grandparents purely out of spite?","NTA

"AITA for not calling my mom to tell her I was getting into a relationship?. So on New Year's Day I got into a relationship with this guy I had been dating. Put it on Facebook to make it ""official"" and everything. And that's how we told everyone, including both of our sets of parents. 

My mom likes the post but doesn't comment anything, text me, or call me. 

His mom comments about how happy she is and calls him the next day to talk about it.

Then a couple of days later I go to my sibling's birthday party and I get hit with ""well thanks for warning me that was going to happen. I had to find out through Facebook.""

I explained that that was how we told everyone, including his parents as well. 

My mother said ""well that's different. That's the mom of the guy. I'm the mom of the girl and I should have been told.""

I also tried to explain to her that she didn't call or text or comment afterward and if she had we could have talked this out then. 

To which she said, ""I'm the parent. I shouldn't have to. You should call me"" or something to that extent. By now I was starting to put my walls.

I can't remember if I offered an apology after that. 

A little while later my grandma and my mom start making comments.

""Getting the milk for free.""

""Can't even tell us when she's in a relationship.""

""It's fine it's not like we NEED to know""

I heard the ""getting milk for free"" about 4 times over the course of 20 minutes. At which out my sibling dragged me away. As I was walking away I did say something to the extent of ""maybe this is why I don't tell you things"".

Some other things go down which aren't relevant really relevant to this post. But ends with my parents upstairs fighting. 

My sibling and I are trying to to listen but I do hear, ""..... Well she's no better! She won't even tell us when she's in a relationship!""

I leave shortly after that but I get a text from my sibling about 20 minutes after I've been home saying that mom is crying in the living room on the phone with her best friend because nobody loves her. And that she tries so hard but no one cares.

Here's the thing. This boy and I have been talking for a year and a half, they knew about that on and off. We started seriously dating back in October, they knew about that and I even asked if my sibling could come with us on a date because it's always important to me that my SO like my sibling. They knew about every date that we had been on. They knew that he wanted to be official and I was the one wanting to take things slow. They already referred to him as my boyfriend even after explaining that he wasn't yet. They knew that I was going to be spending a week at his place during NYE. 

But I can't get it out of my head and now my dad thinks I should apologize. So give it to me straight, am I the asshole?","Wow she sounds like a piece of work.

"AITA for asking my boss if they could turn down the optional Christmas music.. So I work in a warehouse and my boss LOVES holidays. I have no problem with some pumpkins here or a 4 leaf clover there.

The problem is that today she announced she'd be playing Christmas music until Christmas. Most people shared an eye roll because they can listen to their own music, or they were just tired of hearing the same stuff even more.

I was worried because I have some bad memories that can be set off by Christmas music. I gave it my best to ignore it, but she had a powerful speaker that made it nigh impossible for me to ignore. We also have a voice based system, not to mention I likely have ADHD, so it was very distracting to focus on my work. Due to events that happened in a coworker's family last year, this music could also set him off as well.

At the end of the shift, I talked privately to her about some things that happened, and saved the music for last. I said I didn't want to be a downer, but the music was slowing me down, and could trigger memories that I'm trying to work through with my therapist. I emphasized that it was for the sake of the team; we really can't afford to have someone leave early. I ended with ""again, I apologize, I don't mean to be a downer, but..."" and she finished my sentence with ""but you're saying you're why we won't listen to it anymore."" It felt like it was almost a passive aggressive ""oh okay I understand"" and I'm worried this could affect things down the road, such as evaluations.

Basically: bad memories and ADHD meant the Christmas music was a bad call for me. I politely asked her if she could turn it down and gave reasons why, and she responded by opting to turn it off entirely, in what felt like a passive aggressive tone. I have considered talking to her boss about it if things do not improve.

"AITA for kicking out my new tutor. I'm a first year university student. My math finals are soon and I've been looking around for some tutors. Me and this new tutor have been planning to meet up since last week (he was traveling) and we've finally met today. So basically I wasted a week waiting for him when I could've had someone else come. I thought he was worth it because of his demeanor and confidence, as he was saying he only teaches university students and doesn't deal with lower levels.

Once he came I told him that I already studied most of it and just needed to go over some equations. He ignored that and went over the first lesson very slowly, I thought he might've been stalling for time as he was being paid hourly. I told him I understood this lesson and wished to move on; he said okay, flipped one page and continued the same lesson. I insisted, then he went to the second lesson. Eventually, we agreed to start with the last lesson as I didn't fully understand it.

He opened the empty textbook and started writing exactly as it was written in the booklet. I was like, okay. Next thing, there's an equation on the next page. He wrote the equation down then it became clear to me he didn't have any idea what he was doing, so to avoid the awkwardness, I offered to just go over the previous exams which he said they were easy prior to meeting.

Mind you, they were the exact same ones I've shown him. The first few equations were multiple choice. He struggled with the first one, pretended to know how to do it and answered it completely wrong, but made sure it was in the multiple choice answers. I didn't want to just claim he was wrong, as he was struggling with the second one, repeating ""what do we do here, hmm"", I used my math app to look up the correct answer of the first one. He answered the second one completely wrong as well, of course using the exact formula he used above.

I showed him the right answer and he stumbled on his words. Eventually, he admitted to forgetting the lesson. I then told him that he said they were easy. He said yes they are but he forgot them. Lastly, I told him that I couldn't trust him as he was giving me wrong formulas and answers while my finals are very soon. He said I was right, insisted on doing another equation of a different lesson. Struggled with it then finished it correctly somehow. I told him that I was thankful he came all this way to my home (although close) and I was going to pay him for the half an hour he stayed. He gave me a better tutor's number and apologized.

I felt really bad for kicking him out like that. He seemed really nice but very lost. I couldn't help but grieve over the time I've wasted waiting for him, thinking he had it all figured it out. In the end, he was like a sad puppy. It was sad. I never done anything this cruel to anyone as I'm usually very shy. My mom said I shouldn't pay him as he didn't do anything.

I was friends with my roommate for three years before we lived together. We rented a two bedroom duplex with a garage.

A year later it is still there. He’s not working on it, it’s just sitting taking up the entire space. Next thing was his level of cleanliness was poor.

As such we have invited them to come stay with us, on the condition that we get a lock on our room and sibling must find a job ASAP. Keep in mind there is 4 of them and 2 of us, plus my SO's 2 kids (10 &11)  we get every other week for a week at a time. So in short, there are between 6 and 8 people in our 1BEDROOM apartment at any given time. This is mad ass cramped and crazy but we make due while the sibling finds a job and gets back on their feet. Sibling has 3 kids, all of which are incredibly rude, wasteful, and generaly uncaring about everything. The legit dont even care about their own stuff much less stuff that doesn't belong to them. This has led to quite a bit of friction over things like a ridiculous increase in grocery cost and electricity as they leave absolutely everything on and don't care and our kids broken or colored toys.  
Despite the ridiculous behavior and general assholery from the lot of them we have tried to keep things civil and set some ground rules. However, everything crashed when i found out from the kids that Sibling has been picking the lock to our room and entering when we are not home. I lost it, completley lost it. They have been rude and disrespectful but this was crazy past the line, i told my SO that the kids could stay but that Sibling has to be gone by tomorrow.  AITA for this?

"WIBTA if I asked my neighbours to can it?. Hey y'all,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Long time sub lurker here.

TL;DR at the bottom.

I need advice on the level of douchebaggery I would display if I asked my neighbours to stop singing. 

For context: 

\- the singing is loud enough to be heard with TV on, but not so loud that is heard over headphones.

\- our building laws say ppl can make noise within certain hours, so they're not in breach (drats!)

\- there are I think at least 2 who are constantly belting to their heart's content. 

\- hits include: that one part from Beyonce's ""Halo"" where she repeats higher and higher, Adele and some George Michael? (I mean I like the songs..though not their rendition)

\- I think they might be rehearsing because they're only repeating pieces of the song (over and over) with no backup other than the voice. 

\- Last but not least, most of the times it sounds plain bad. It's like I am forced to be a part of someone's shower concert.

Why would I stifle people's creativity? I work from home and have exams coming up. I want to not have to have headphones all the time, in my own home.

WIBTA if I wrote them a nice letter to suggest soundproofing, or working around each other's hours? I feel like I'm one ""Hello"" away from stomping up there like Mr. Heckles!

"AITA for telling my (ex) stepmother that our home is substandard?. For context, I am an 18 year old male. 3 years ago, I lived with my father, stepmother (of 10 years at the time) and my younger brother. My freshman year of high school (now a Senior) I lost my dad to mental illness. I never had the best relationship with my stepmother, so I moved in with my grandparents for a year, before realizing I couldn't stand my school, and so I moved back in with my stepmother and brother.

While I was gone with my grandparents, my stepmom (SM from here on out) sold the house, and bought an RV, as a temporary stopgap to her dream of building a tiny home. I was told we would have our own bedrooms. My room wkuld be 10x9, plenty big enough for a teenage boy. When she offered to take me back in, she told me that we would be moved in by the winter. It's been two years now and we still live in an RV. She bought me my own camper, wasn't much, but it had a bed. I slept there for a year and a half, until the heater broke in October I continued to sleep in my camper for another two months, despite the inside temperature being often in the high 40's, because I valued my privacy and a bed more than being warm. 

Eventually, based on our climate, it got too cold to stay there, and so I started sleeping in the RV. I sleep on a loveseat, and use the armrest as a pillow. This is the same coach that my dog sleeps on all day, and our family uses while watching TV.

A few weeks ago, I received a notice from our homeless advocate at school, saying that based on my living conditions, I qualify for certain benefits. I told SM about this, and she got upset, saying our home isn't substandard, and shouldn't qualify. I then said that I see why they believe it is, and  pointed out the deficiencies (water heater has been broken lately so I have to go to YMCA 30 minutes away to shower, we used a composting toilet until a month ago, I sleep on a loveseat, my heater was broken, our living room is also my bedroom....and the dining room, etc etc). She freaked out, saying I wasn't thankful. I think I'm more than thankful that she let me move back to the school I love so much. But I also think she is incredibly lazy. She got out of the army 3 years ago, and has taken random classes to get the GI Bill benefits. That's what she lives off of. She is more than capable of getting a job. she also hasn't made a meal for our family for as long as I can remember. The only time I get a cooked meal is when I go to my friend's house (I can't afford to stock our pantry myself). 

So, AITA for calling my living arrangement substandard?","NTA but I would just take the benefits, move out, and stay as far away from that as possible.

Myself and F are really worried about F as they are going back to uni in September and will be reunited with friends who encourage this type of behaviour.

"AItA for not wanting to go out on date night?. A little back story. I have a bad case of mono. Not sure if I got it from my new girlfriend who doesn't think she ever had it or my nephew who had it last fall, or some rando sneaking in my food and giving it to me, whatever the case I got it bad.

At it's worst I was sleeping 20 hours a day, jaundice skin, inflamed spleen, beach ball neck, and had trouble lifting anything heavier than a Harry Potter book. 

I am getting better and I have actually been back to work, but if no one keeps me up I fall asleep 4pm. On Friday my girlfriend and I went on a date night and I ended up falling asleep at the store we were shopping in around 630. Today she wanted us and her daughter to go to a movie at 4. I figured if I drank soda I could stay awake and be caffeinated enough to drive home after without falling asleep at the wheel. 

So we went out and had some ice cream. While getting ice cream I went to the theatre website to get tickets, but it turns out the movie isn't until 5. I told her I didn't feel comfortable staying out that late yet. At this point I am already tired enough to fall asleep and I am just forcing myself to stay awake because I want to spend time with them. I offer to hang out until the movie starts but she doesn't want to. She suggests skipping the movie at the theatre, driving back to town renting a movie and watching something at home.

If we did this, the movie would still not start till after 5 but now we would have a kid who was told we were going to the theatre and then got denied that we have to watch the movie at home with. So I would rather cut out and go to bed at this point. We make plans to go see dumbo this weekend and I ask her if we can hang out tomorrow, but instead she gives me attitude and insists I don't want to hang out with her so she will just see me later.

"AITA for refusing to quit a friendship my GF doesn't aprove?. Being introduced to this sub via youtube I thought it was time to post my story. 

So, I used to be the chairman of a study association. Our study association is a member of another broader association that has the purpose to organise bigger events for students, like parties and drinks in our joint society, or lectures that are interesting for all students. Via joint meetings of the ""broader association"" with other ""study associations"" who are also members, i met a girl a couple of years younger than me. We chatted a lot during drinks after meetings and even started hanging out from time to time. We were friends, nothing more. Other people noticed that we were close and wondered if we were dating, but we always said no to that as we both agreed to be friends, nothing more. We also chat alot with each other via whatsapp, as she lives in a different city. This is important for later on.

Later that year I started dating a girl who was a committee member of my study association. She's great and it feels like we really connect. We are still dating, and we decided to go on a city trip. She had already noticed how close I was with this ""association girl"" and I had already ensured her that we were nothing more than friends. But every time I recieve a text from her, and my girlfriend notices, she looks at me with jealous eyes. This ofcourse had to also happen when we were having lunch in a restaurant. She noticed texts coming in on my phone, checked from who they were and asked me what it was between me and this ""association girl"". I told her I already tried to ensure her that we were just friends, nothing more, and that we texted because ""association girl"" lived in a different city. She went quiet after that and we didn't say much to me the rest of our trip. On our way back to our home I asked why it was such a big issue for her. She basically said that she worried I was cheating on her with ""association girl"". I was shocked. I said to her that we were nothing more than friends and she had nothing to worry about. Then she told me ""if you really like me, then stop contacting that girl"". I basically refused to quit my friendship with ""association girl"" and said she should trust me and that trust is the basis of any relationship. 

I told this story to my sister and mother and they agreed with my girlfriend. They said to me that if I really should end contact with that ""association girl"" if I really cared for my girlfriend. I still refuse to do it, in my opinion I can choose who my friends are, female or male. I told this my girlfriend in a telephone call too. She told me that I could, but this was a different case as me and ""association girl"" were really close and other people ""also suspected that we were in a relationship of some sorts"".

I figured this was an easy choice, and kissed the second guy, and we left together pretty soon afterward.

She told me it was for weed and I tried to explain that I am not comfortable with giving her money to buy something that she knows I do not agree with. I said it would be hypocritical, and would make me feel awful if I gave her money for the weed and would probably feel the same if it were for alcohol. She seemed to understand and I tried to make sure that she understood that I wasn't doing this out of spite. We both enjoyed the rest of the evening watching TV.

"AITA for kicking 3 drunk girls out of my car at night b/c they were singing offensive songs?. Full disclosure, this happened roughly a year ago while I was still in grad school. I was an uber driver at night to earn some extra money and would often pick up drunk college kids going to-from bars.

&#x200B;

So this night I picked up 3 drunk girls from a neighboring school. They were going from a campus pregame to some bar/club in the next town over. I'm a small female who drove strangers at night so I had a little laminated rule card hanging on the backseat. Basically no rude, drunken behavior, nothing that disturbs my driving otherwise I have the right to kick them out whenever. If they refuse I call the cops.

&#x200B;

On the way there the girls start drinking vodka out of water bottles and I ask them to stop several times. They do for a while but I still catch them sneaking sips. Then minutes later they start singing some sorority song (it was Party in the USA but with their sorority name put in). At one point this girl starts talking about one of their friends and they start chanting ""f\*ggot"" and laughing then they break out that same song and add his name into the lyrics and also a bunch of similar slurs. At this point I'm fed up. I've asked them several times to A) stop drinking in my car and B) calm down and shut up.

&#x200B;

Granted, I never said if they don't stop I'm kicking them out because in my mind I already gave them plenty of chances. I spot one of those little 24hr drive thru Taco Bells and pull over and tell them to get out of my car. I tell them to go ask the restaurant to call them another ride because I'm done. They get out in confusion and I just drive off. I reported the incident as advised but heard nothing back from Uber.

So recently I was sharing stories of my uber driving days and told this little story. A few people thought I was a major asshole because I put those girls in a lot of danger by leaving them at a random Taco Bell parking lot at night.

Really, I love kids.

The one problem however that when they play outside together, it always involves screaming at the top of their lungs.

Sure, I know kids screaming is normal but they don't do it just every now and then but every damn second.

Going to another room doesn't help as they tend to run around my apartment building all the time while screaming as loud as they can so I can't escape.

Putting on music also wouldn't help as that would just distract me too.

My mom doesn’t force him to do anything and let’s it slide, but on his birthday, she forces me to get him a card and/or a gift, and if I don’t, she doesn’t speak to me for a couple days. He also used to scream and cry on my birthday because I got gifts and he didn’t, so she’d go out and buy him gifts to make him happy. My dad has tried talking to her about the double standard but she gets up and leaves in the middle of the conversation.

Tomorrow is my brother’s birthday, and I’d honestly rather spend the day with my boyfriend. I recently had surgery and am on a very limited diet because of it, so I have no idea what I’d be able to eat if we went out (probably somewhere fancy and expensive because that’s all my brother ever wants). I want to hang out with my bf at my house and lay in bed with him while I recover, not go out and listen to my brother be a dickhead to restaurant workers because they don’t have “fancy” jobs like he does.

I know if I were to do this, my mom would be angry with me, but my dad would understand. I already have a poor relationship with my mom and brother because my mom is verbally/emotionally abusive, and my brother is just a dickhead, so honestly, I don’t really mind if my relationship with them goes down the drain after this.

"AITA for getting into a massive anti-vax argument. Background: I am 16 (pro-vax) and my grandma is 56 (anti-vax). My first mistake was adding her on Facebook and I’m sure I made others. Simply put, it started when she posted an article about the recent measles outbreak in Portland and how it was mostly kids who were already vaccinated. This immediately sounded like bs to me so I checked the article and it’s sources said just the opposite. So I commented that the posted article was misinformed and that it’s good to stay up to date of real information. This developed into a small argument in the comments. She later then sent me a huge text explaining how I was wrong and that it was disrespectful to challenge what she says. I told her that I disagreed and that I could be persuaded by some scientific evidence that was properly peer reviewed. She then sent me source after source and I would fact check them and read multiple peer reviews on them. Not a single source she sent me was factually correct. The argument heated to a boiling point when she eventually said this “Did I say creepy. Oh yes. I already pointed that out. Please do not contact me again.  I’m done with you.” I was a bit hurt and it kinda took me off guard that she would just cut me off like that because she is normally very kind and loving. I normally would not have gotten into a huge argument but she is a huge proponent in the reason my niece isn’t vaccinated even when we live in a state with measles outbreaks. My concern is mainly for her safety and I genuinely would change my opinion given the evidence, but I believe strongly in the scientific process. AITA for the situation escalating the way it did. 


Edit: this isn’t about whether or not anti-vax is right. It is mainly about whether or not I took it to far with the argument.

"AITA For forgetting to tell my girlfriend I was leaving earlier on my birthday?.  

So today is my birthday (yay me) and I've had plans with my family to go out to dinner all week. I was with my girlfriend for most of the morning and we were hanging out playing a game together, my mom came in and let me know that we were going to be leaving earlier because there was suppose to be freezing rain (We had a storm the night before so it was pretty bad). I forgot to let my girlfriend know and just continued to play the game with her. It just sorta slipped my mind I wasn't paying much attention to my mom and heard just enough to clue into it, but yeah I forgot to let her know I was leaving earlier. 

When the time to leave finally came around my mom was telling me to hurry up and that everyone was ready to go and they were just waiting on me, I had told my girlfriend that we were leaving earlier because of the freezing rain. I left our discord call and was trying to type to her as much as I could while my mom is rushing me out the door, My girlfriend was super upset that I didn't let her know we were leaving earlier and was saying if I leave I will ""regret it"" and was trying to make me not leave. My mom started yelling so I told my girlfriend I loved her and that I would try to message her if I could. I walked up the stairs and open up discord to find out she changed her profile picture to a picture she knows I don't like having as a profile picture because it is a bit revealing. she has down this multiple times and each time I've freaked out and begged her to take it off. But after I see this when I open my phone I get really upset and I start flipping and I did say something like ""BooHoo I didn't let you know right when I found oh"" and I was basically being pretty rude. She said if I went out with them I'd regret it and to come back right away, I told her I couldn't and she got more upset. 

As we were driving there she continue to threaten me. When we finally arrived she had texted me with a picture of her sending private photos to another guy (Later I found out she didn't, but led me to believe she did) and kept saying she would send my stuff around as well. She said she would add my friends and send them my stuff and basically was just throwing threats around. When I finally got home I told her I wanted to hang out with my family and she proceeded to threaten me even more saying ""If you leave you will regret it"" and I finally told her I'd be fast. I came back and we started arguing again it feels like at least to me she is trying to deflect and minimize everything she has done.

"AITA for not wanting to meet my boyfriends family?. A week ago I noticed my boyfriend liking revealing photos of his ex gf on Instagram. I was upset and sent him a message explaining how it made me feel (like a bit of an idiot really, not good enough for him, etc.) He was impatient with me and explained that it wasn't that deep for him and I shouldn't overthink things. I felt a bit stupid but we were seeing one another later that night for date night (we'd planned this all week and it was the only night that week we'd seen one another due to busy schedules). Anyhow, he cancels this and says ""I'm just not in the mood for it anymore after all this"" making me feel guilty for calling him out on the selfie-liking thing. I feel upset because it didn't feel like anything was resolved and it just further strengthened the insecurity that he didn't care about me, I asked if I could just come round for an hour to sort things out, but he said no.

He said we couldn't see one another for almost 14 days (despite living just 15 min away) bcos he has exams to revise for. Fair enough he has exams, but could he not find an hour in his schedule to put things right with me and just get back on good terms? To me some things just need to be resolved in person and not over text. He refused and said he had to revise, which I tried to be understanding with because I know his exams are important. 

But during this period of time he was still finding time to hang out with friends, play video games, watch netflix, gym etc. but he couldn't see me for an hour. I asked 3 times if he wanted to hang out but again he declined so it got to the point where I stopped asking because I felt stupid. And I'm not one to beg someone to let me be a part of their life. 

I once messaged him ""missing you"" and he didn't open the message for 6hrs despite being online and commenting on posts etc. I know he was just sat at his PC, so why couldn't he just take 5 seconds to type a quick message back? 

Little stuff like this has built up over the week and tonight he was coming to mine before driving us down to his hometown to meet his family for the first time. It's been planned for a while and I was excited for it. He gets here and I feel really awkward and uncomfortable around him because he's acting like everything is okay but I've had all the stress of this past week on my mind and feel unsure if we're even okay as a couple.

 I explain that I can't go spend the weekend staying at his fams house (for the first time which is a nervewracking thing for me) whilst we still haven't addressed any of the past week or the fact that I feel like he doesn't care about me.

He's mad because he didn't realise there was anything wrong and I've ""ruined a good night"". I also know his parents bought food for me and were expecting to see me.

Events in chronological order:

I've been with my bf for 5 years

He gets an invite to a family wedding that doesn't include a plus one. I sign up to participate in a performance that turns out to be the same weekend. 

We go on vacation and get engaged. 

We keep it on the DL until about 3 weeks after we get back, when we can tell his parents in person. I have attended a few show practices at this point. 

We tell his parents. That night, a new wedding invitation is printed that includes the +1 for me. His parents tell me I'm invited, i decline with regrets as I'm already tied up in something. End of story? 

No.

"AITA for telling me uncle “you have the money for it”. I know from the title that it would appear that I am the asshole. And I am. You’ll see why below. I’m just wondering if I’m justified.

For context I’m a 15 year old, my uncle is a 60 year d orthopedic surgeon with a fellowship and works in a private practice. He makes six figures, probably half a million a year ish.

I live across the country from him and visit for a weekend every summer. Three years ago I had bought a board game (Smash Up) and had forgotten it at his house. I was visiting my cousins after leaving and really wanted to play the game with them and was sad that I had left it so I asked him if he could ship it ASAP to my cousin’s house, and he very kindly did.

Ever since then every visit he brings it up about how he shipped it and the cost of shipping it was more than the cost of the game itself ($35 vs $30) and that I was so desperate to get it (although the last part is a bit of a joke; we razz each other a bit so exaggerating the desperateness is fine). He doesn’t bring it up to be malicious or anything he’s just happy that it made me happy and likes to tease about how desperate I was.

Well this year as I was leaving he talked about it and truthfully I got a bit annoyed because:
A) he never told me the price of shipping it and also as a 12 year old who had never shipped anything I didn’t realize it was $35. Had I known that I would have just bought a new one with my own money. I thought it would be $10-15 to pay for it.
B) he can afford $35 no problem.

So anyway my mom thanked him for sending it and so did I, and then he talked a bit more about it, and then when he mentioned the cost again I said, “well you do have the money to pay for it,” which ended all discussion on that topic. After saying goodbyes we left.

On the one hand I’m quite sure I’m an asshole because I accused him of having excess money and being stingy (I didn’t say that but in our society that’s often what it’s interpreted as). On the other hand I think he might be an asshole too because he feels the need to bring up the cost of it despite the cost not mattering at all (besides it being a loss of $5 for him, which he mentioned). And on my imaginary third hand I think maybe neither of us are assholes and we are just misunderstanding each other and need to re-evaluate that joke.

What do you all think?

Edit: feel that this needs to be said. I personally do not plan on paying him back $35 nor does he want $35 from me. We were both on good terms and still are on good terms.","NTA - What is he expecting from this situation, you being 15 (12 at the time)? That you promise to pay him back when you get to working age?

"WIBTA if I told my brothers ex-girlfriend that I don't want to hang out with her. So as the title says, I (17F) don't really fancy the idea of keeping in touch with my brothers (19) ex-girlfriend (also 19).

My problem is that she sort of won't let me go. Because she just recently moved to my city she still currently lives in my bedroom and I temporarily moved out to my brother (they kinda don't wanna see each other right now so that was the best solution) She will move into her own apartment on the first of October.

She knows no one in my city except for me,my brother and his friends so she always wants to hang out with me. She's not a bad person but definitely not someone I'd be good friends with. So far I always told her that I don't have time and other stuff I made up to have an excuse. 

Right now it's getting to a point where I don't want to keep telling her lies to avoid her and also it's just generally exhausting to explain to her that my life doesn't revolve around her.
I told her a few times to go out and meet people and she downright refuses. I also took her with me a few times to meet some people of my friend group in the hopes that she would find someone to befriend there.
I already would have told her that I am not a ""really good friend"" of her and I'm just being nice because she was my brothers girlfriend and I wanted to make her feel welcome in my family but there are a few issues. the main one being that she is a borderliner. 

She was only just released from a mental health clinic   2 months ago and that's about how long I've known her.
The breakup really took a toll on her and she hasn't been doing that good so I don't want to throw this shit at her now too. But I also can't go on like this.

"AITA for refusing to take my little brother to the park after a long day?. I should preface this by saying I’m a 16 year old in high school and my brother is 5 years old still in preschool. Also, I’m the oddball in the extended family as I’m one of the only ones that is “low energy” (I’m pretty much always tired as it is) and I don’t get along with most of my family. 
Anyway, since 6AM to about 2PM I had been prepping, stressing over and taking my AP Chemistry test and I tried to make sure my mother knew the implications his test had to make it obvious to her that I’d be tired after it. Usually when I get back home she has me take care of my little brother or go and run errands all day and I really did not wanna deal with that after an exhausting 4 hours of sitting in a room with paper and pencil. 
So I get back home after my test and tell my mom about the test. I tell her all about how long it is and how it’s supposed to measure wether I actually payed attention in my college class. I even tell her that I’m probably gonna pass out in a couple of minutes to make it obvious that I can’t be relied on that day. There’s also no other man in the house so if my mom can’t handle everything it falls on to me which is why I want to make this clear. 
But what do you know, she gets a call for her work and tells me that she doesn’t have an option but to have me take care of my little brother. I’m okay with that since she works two jobs and this isn’t anything new. I just don’t wanna have to drive my little brother around or take him places because of how tired I feel. I always feel tired but this was like I’m gonna die if I move a muscle tired. 
So it’s a good thing that my little brother demands that we go to the park immediately after I’m assigned to take care of him. I was hoping my mom would understand and help me convince him that we can go another day but she instead got mad at me and started saying stuff about how lazy I am and “it’s not like you do everything for this house”. I kept persisting that only bad things would come from me taking him to the park and my mother had it. She demanded the keys to the car I’ve been driving and the credit card that’s connected to her bank account. I’m not upset by this honestly as I only used the car for school and I’ll use it if I have to cause otherwise my education will suffer and she’s always taught me it came first. The credit card I only ever used for food and she can’t exactly not feed me so nothing lost. 
What really did upset me though was my guilt for not taking my little brother outside or to the park. He eventually started crying which he does often anyway but it still sucks to know I made him cry cause of a stupid reason like being tired. I can’t help but feel like I’m a shitty brother but at the same time, I can’t just neglect how I feel right? AITA here?","NTA Your family needs you to help out by watching your little brother, unfortunate, but necessary, and given how hard your mom is working this is just a bad situation. However, your family does not need you to take your brother to the park. It needs you to keep him safe and well. This can be done without a park trip. It would be reasonable for your little brother to contribute to the family by accepting that he won't always get to go out and do fun things and sometimes needs to entertain himself at home. Note, I'm not really faulting him for not getting this, as he is quite young.

"AITA for making mention of a monetary transaction between me and my brother while his fianceé is present? ( more info inside ). Good evening.

Today I met with my brother and his fianceé just to get a coffee and talk a bit.

The topic of their marriage came up, and my brother said he'd help me out picking a suitable shirt, pants and shoes for the venue.

I told him we could go shopping during September ( I've lost around 25 lbs / 11kg and I am currently getting fitter and fitter, I plan to lose another couple of kilos by september so buying said outfit during said month would be best for me ) and he agreed with me, jokingly saying he'd charge me £22000, 2000 for each kilo lost.

I jokingly replied that I had already given him £4000. ( I lent him money years ago and he's slowly giving it back. The money, though, was originally given to me by him, at least part of it that is, when I was a child. I was never made to know, and just thought that it was exclusively money that my grandma left me when she passed. )

His fianceé then stays silent but is shook, and later on they have an argument regarding this money.

They go outside, he comes back inside alone and tells me I should have minded my own business, telling me that I am smart but sometimes I'm an idiot.

He then goes on about the fact that he can do whatever he wants with his money, and I agree with him, and goes on to explain where that money came from.

Now, here's the problem: I was mortified because I inadvertently made a fight break out between the both of them, but I started fuming once I realized that my comment and my joke where made on the assumption that said monetary exchange was completely innocent and done lovingly ( I love my big bro to bits ), and that there wasn't anything to hide, because nothing was worth hiding about that.

At the same time, I would have never joked about it if: 1) I had any idea that he'd fight with his fianceé

2) I had any idea that the money wasn't originally mine ( I might have even told him not to give it back. )

"AITA for not letting my ex’s friend help move?. Long story short, my boyfriend of 2 years and I have broken up. We were stuck in a lease together for a remaining month, and we toughed it out. It was a hard and emotional break up, but we still did daily tasks together such as dinner, grocery shopping, hanging out and occasional movie nights in the same bed. 

Throughout our relationship my boyfriend has a group of friends who are girls that he has known since high school. They were close with his ex, and continued to talk to his ex and encourage her to try and get him back. They would start drama, telling his ex private things about mine and my boyfriends relationship, and talking to my boyfriend about his ex coming to visit and so on. Towards the end of the relationship, me and a specific friend of his, T, didn’t get along. She would send my boyfriend texts saying rude comments about me, try and convince my boyfriend to give his ex girlfriend a chance again, always make passive aggressive comments about my appearance and clothes. She would call me a rat, fat, and other random things. After the break up, it got much worse. She sent me videos of my ex boyfriend making out with random girls at the bar on Snapchat and then send me “oops wrong person.” 
My ex boyfriend went to a cook out with a group of our mutual friends, and I decided not to go to not make things weird since he was my ex. A mutual friend told me that for a majority of the night T was making rude comments about me, trying to get people to join in with her, and this continued for a majority of the night until people finally told her to stop. I finally texted her, saying that I was no longer with my ex, so she no longer was a part of my life and to please move on with her life and leave me out of her conversations. The next day I got harassed by multiple fake numbers saying I am pathetic, my ex never loved me, I should get a personal trainer etc. When I blocked a number, another one would just text me. 
Fast forward to this weekend, me and my ex are finally moving out. It was last minute that we got out of our lease, so we had a two days notice to pack and move. 90% of the stuff in the house is his so I understand he was stressed and needed help moving.  When he mentioned that friend T was coming to help, I said I do not want her at the house when I am there. He had multiple friends helping him move, and T was not going to be much help moving anything that was left, because they were larger items and she was a very small girl. My ex said I was being immature and that I needed to grow up and get along for the sake of moving out, but I stuck my ground.

For the past few days, I've been working myself to death clearing out my parents house and our house of junk for a yard sale. I also have two sons that I am taking care of, as well as running a household.

Tonight, after everything was done, and the kids were asleep, I laid on the couch. I explained I am exhausted from everything I've been doing and I just have to relax and am probably going to crash early.

My husband kept talking to me, and after awhile I said ""Babe, I'm really tired. Can we have some quiet time?""

So he kept talking, with the TV super loud, etc. And instead of telling him to quiet down and have his night be affected, I said ""I'm going to lay in the bedroom and relax where it's quiet.""

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years, so our relationship is really serious and all, and I won't leave him for this of course, but it's still something that makes me angry from time to time.

I'll tell it with a story: we've planned to go to a street food festival this saturday, everything is fine until his dad calls and demands for his help on saturday. So we immediately have to cancel our little trip so he can help his dad. Maybe you see the point already. 
Of course, I'm not against him helping his dad and I also like that they have such a strong relationship, but it literally happens all the time.

His dad is in only his mid 50's and also some kind of craftsman, he is muscular and can do things on his own. Plus he has a lot of friends that can also help him with stuff. But no, it has to be my boyfriend, as always. And of course, my boyfriend never ever (not once) says no. We always have to shift our schedules so he has time to help him. 

Also, last summer we were at my bf's parent's place for dinner and his dad demanded that my bf helps him next summer (means this year's summer) for a whole week to paint his house. He did not ask ""Could you?"", he said ""Come over and help."" Yes, this is a major task that one can't do alone but as I said, he has so many friends, including my step-dad, who could help him. Still, my boyfriend didn't say no.

This is just something that really pisses me off because it makes me feel that he prefers everything his dad does and says over me. When we make plans days or even weeks before, his dad chimes in a day before the event and asks for help, everything else gets cancelled. 

I've also talked to my bf about this but he just said that I see this differently because I didn't really have a dad growing up (which unfortunately is right). Am I overreacting about this or is my anger justified? I really need to know because it also makes me feel bad for being angry that my boyfriend spends time with his dad.

"AITA just moved, want a weekend to myself, now I'm selfish. Background:
I recently decided to move out after living with my boyfriend for the last 4 years. I just needed to get some space and independence from this relationship and he was very supportive. Not being able to afford my own apartment just yet, I moved in with one of my best friends from college.

I moved in 3 weeks ago, but there was a bunch of issues with the moving truck and supplies so it ended up not being until last weekend that I actually had all my stuff moved. I'm still sleeping on an air mattress, and everything is still in boxes.

Last weekend my roommate announced that we were invited to go camping this weekend, and that another friend from college was flying out too. I expressed that this would be the first weekend I'd have to myself in about 3 weeks to finally get settled in, unpack my shit, so the timing was bad. 

My roommate was kind of understanding, but then kept bringing it up, that I could just wait another week to unpack and do laundry. I told her I wanted this weekend, but she kept pushing the subject so finally I just said fine I'll go. 

Then I was asked to dig out all of my camping supplies to provide to the group as they dont have their own. Wednesday night we went back to my boyfriend's place to get everything and on the way back home I just finally felt so stressed and over it that I just told her to take the stuff but that I would not be going.

"AITA for yelling at SO at our oldests 1st birthday?. This is an old story but he still maintains it was funny, I maintain it ruined the party.

So about 4 years ago our oldest son was turning 1. At the time I wasn't working, just in school so I had plenty of time to plan this party, which we made jungle themed. I made him a little tarzan outfit, made a giant sandwich snake, jungle music and so on, i went full blown pinterest on this party. My SO, although we were going through a rough patch at the time so he was ex at the time, was working second shift so he wasnt home most of the day. 

The 3 days leading up to the party, I was working my butt off with shopping and cleaning and organizing and still doing school and taking care of my my oldest and youngest. I paid a friend of mine to come take pictures of the party so I wouldnt have to and could focus on the party. I only asked for one thing to go right, or at least well. I wanted a fun smash cake photo.

So everyone, or at least US everyone, for a child's first birthday usually has what's called a smash cake, which is just a mini cake for the baby to smash and play and eat and make a huge mess for fun.  Day of the party goes well, baby is having fun, and hes enjoying the attention. Time for cake!

I set the cake in front of my oldest, we sing happy birthday, he sticks one finger in the cake and looks at it, gets ready to dig in and my SO comes up and pushed his face into the cake. He freaks out, starts crying, of course. I rip into my SO and take baby inside to bath and after the party continues, albeit a little more tense. The rest of the evening while I was cleaning up and SO was sitting on the couch, he was still mad I yelled at him, and said it was a funny joke and oldest wouldnt even remember it anyways and refused to see why I was upset.

"AITA for essentially cutting my mom out my baby's life?. I'm really struggling making my mind up on this and keep going back and forth. I love my mom but I've reached the end of my rope here.

So growing up my dad was never around (not my moms fault he took off and never came back). And my mom had what seemed to me a never ending stream of relationships. I never had one consistent father figure in my life. 

I was also abused when I was really young. Not going to go into too much detail about it because its something I still really struggle with to this day.

Me and my partner have recently found out we're expecting a baby (I'm super excited as I never thought this would happen due to my issues from my earlier abuse). My mom had just gotten married not that long ago and she has just split from her new husband. After looking back at my childhood I made it clear that if she was going to start seeing loads of different men then I wouldn't be having that around my baby. As I had grown up with this and it really affected me. She agreed with me at the time. Then told me later that she had joined several dating sites. I of course wasnt happy with this as I thought I had made my point clear. Something else I've struggled with over the years is that she still speaks to my abuser and says shes only doing it to get him back someday. So she would regularly tell me whenever she spoke to him not really thinking that it would upset me. I'm not good at speaking up for myself and have alot of social anxiety. 

I then found out she had started speaking to an ex of hers who had repeatedly cheated on her and had also said some disgusting things about my unborn child. I contacted my mom and finally told her everything that upset me. Especially the part where she had been talking to my abuser for years. She apologised and said she never realised that it would upset me so much and has blocked them from being able to contact. She said she had also deleted the dating profiles and would stop talking to the ex. My partner never knew about her still speaking to my abuser and wants her nowhere near our child. And while I agree I still love my mother. She has apologised. I've spoken to her and explained that while I may talk to her one day when I have worked through my issues with her. Right now she wouldn't be involved with our baby. 

Am I the asshole for this. I feel terrible I know how much she loves kids and had always wanted grandchildren and I feel like I'm now depriving her of a relationship with her grandchild.

"AITA if I'm angry at my mum for not spending as much money on me as my brother, and if i sell a gift?. Context here: Our ""birthday budget"" is usually around £150 per child.

It was my 18th birthday in January, which is a big deal. When my brother turned 18 (he is 20 now) my mum spent about £500 on him for driving lessons etc, bearing in mind we do not have a lot of money.
My mum always asks what I would like so I told her I just wanted some nice clothes and a couple books, pretty standard. Now usually my mum takes my sister with her when buying presents for me (and vice versa) but this year she didn't so I asked my sister about it and she said ""mum apparently has something really special for you already"" and I figured it would be money or something since I'm moving out soon. 
Anyway fast forward to my birthday and she had gotten me a necklace with matching earrings, nothing else. Honestly, I was disappointed seeing as I don't wear jewelry (I'm very much a ""tom-boy"") and it's also not my style as all.
A couple weeks later I asked her why she didn't listen to what I actually wanted and just copped out and got me an necklace (which I guessed was about £60) and nothing I'd actually have a use for or like. And we argued a bit about it because she spent so much on my brother for his 18th when I have a job and pay for groceries while he lives at home for free, unemployed and doesn't go to school or anything. She got pretty annoyed and told me the necklace and earring combination cost about £300. 

Anyway, I apologised for being ungrateful and told her that I did like it I just don't have an occasion to wear it etc etc,

Now I'm moving out very soon, so I want to sell this necklace which would give me a decent amount for groceries for myself but I'm worried my mum will think I'm being very ungrateful, especially since we already argued about this. I feel like I'm just extra frustrated about it because of how differently she treats my brother when it come to money and birthdays. 

Am I being ungrateful?

"WIBTA if I left my husband bc of his ADHD?. throwaway. My husband and I are both 34. We've been together since we were 20, bought a house together at 27, and married at 31. We have no kids

We've got some challenges- He's extremely forgetful, drives so recklessly I don't want to be in a car w/ him, makes decisions without thinking, is extremely impulsive, has no sense of time management, and struggles to prioritize tasks. He's been telling me forever that all of this is ""just his personality"" and I knew this when I started dating him. He's not wrong, but I thought that was the personality of a 20 year old stoner in a puka shell necklace.

3-4 years back, right around the time of our wedding he found Jessica McCabe's TedTalk. It was a lightbulb moment for both of us. My husband very clearly has ADHD. Listening to Jessica describe her life was like listening to my husband. It's very obvious to both of us that this is what's been going on. If you listen to Jessica's talk or follow her work, she's emphatic that one of the most important pieces to her recovery was getting on the right meds and getting with the right therapist. He has refused. ""This is just how (he) is."" and I should deal with it.

Fast forward to yesterday. The incident that broke the camel's back. He left me at the grocery store.

We had just come out of publix and we were loading the groceries in the car. He grabbed the last two bags out of the cart and I said ""why don't i bring the cart back up front and you can pick me up there?"" He agreed. I took the cart back into the store and as I was coming out, I saw him leave the parking lot. I thought ""surely, he's just going to swing around."" He did not. I realize at this moment that my wallet, keys, cell phone, money and ID are all in the passengers seat of his car. So he is gone and I am alone, with no money, no ID and no phone in front of the grocery trying to figure out what I've done wrong. Reader, I sat there for just over TEN MINUTES before he came back. Which means he was 5 minutes back to our house before he realized I wasn't there. I took him 30 seconds to forget me, and 5 minutes to remember.

I think I'm done. I just don't think I can deal with this anymore. It's like playing roulette with him, I never know if I'm going to get the thoughtful stable husband, or an overgrown forgetful child. His risk taking, forgetfulness, and insensitivity make me feel like I don't matter. I am deeply, painfully jealous when we hang out with other couples because I want the doting husband, I want the teammate, I want the partner I don't have. My mother and some of my friends tell me I'm crazy, I knew what I was getting into, I just need to live with his ADHD. Others are telling me that if I feel this bad, I should leave, and that if it was alcohol/drugs/physical abuse and he wasn't getting help, no one would question my choice.

So, WIBTA if I left him because his untreated ADHD is making me feel like I don't matter as a person?

&#x200B;

Update 1: I want to thank everyone here, especially those with ADHD. I thought I had been clear with him about how much his actions were hurting me, but I took ya'lls advice and last night over dinner I laid it on the table. Clearly. Concisely. Bluntly. I told him that while I'm not necessarily ready to say this is irreparable, his past actions have shown that he'll only focus on this issue for a short period of time and then forget, so I need to move ahead as though we are divorcing and I have found an apartment. In the meantime, he needs to work on getting in to see a specialist, and I need to work with someone else to process all of this and find some strategies for myself. He hemmed and hawed for a bit, gave a lot of excuses for why it hasn't happened yet. #1 was money- ""I can't find a doctor in my network..."" I asked calmly- ""do you think you will spend more money paying for an out of network therapist, or a divorce lawyer?"" Guess what happened today? WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT!

"AITA for suing a potentially indigent electrician?. I'm going to grad school soon. To keep my costs down, I am living in an RV. I bought the RV by saving  a up a lot of money and using some of an inheritance I got from my grandfather's estate. The RV I bought turned out to have a lot of problems, so I parked it at my parent's place to renovate it. I decided to have an electrician install a 30 amp, 110 volt outlet at my parent's place so I could use the RV's entire electrical potential while working on it. 

I hired a local ""electrician"" with great reviews online, and a website that said he was ""licensed, trusted, and insured."" This person installed a 240 volt outlet outside, despite the outlet itself saying it was for 110 volt service. When I plugged my RV in, it fried my RV's central console, all of my electronics plugged into the RV (laptop, power tools, game system), my refrigerator, and my AC. 

I was, of course, furious. 

He effectively destroyed the majority of my assets with his egregious screw up. I called him back the next day, informing him that I was going to sue him if his mistake was not corrected and I was made whole.

He comes back, profusely apologizing, and states he will start working immediately. I come over to him, asking for his insurance information. I figured that he was not qualified to work on my RV. He reported that he did not have insurance...

I lost my composure. I started yelling at him, telling him I was going to ""sue the shit"" out of him. He started to run away. My father, a lawyer, came out to see if he could help with the situation and calm me down since this guy has effectively destroyed all of my assets. 

My father told me to take a picture of the sign on his truck which side that he was licensed and insured. He ripped off the signs and dove into his truck. I took a picture of him in his truck without the signs I our driveway and his license plate. I later screencapped his website which reported that he was licensed and insured. He said suing him would be useless because it would be like ""bleeding a turnip."" He said he only made 8K last year, and has a wife and four children. 

He did not understand why I was trying to go the legal route, as he was trying to make it right by working on my RV. Since he is not insured, I do not him to work on my RV or anything, especially since he screwed up so fantastically before. 

This smells of BS to me, but I am at my wit's end, so everything does. How would you survive on 8K a year with 4, perhaps 5 mouths to feed, even if you're living in the rural American South? 

I tried to look him up on my state's board of electricians using the license number he gave me. It appears that the license he showed me is fraudulent, which is its own issue. I will call the licensing board on Monday to make absolutely sure that I am correct in this matter. I have already contacted the BBB over this issue. I also posted numerous negative reviews of his service online on various sites. My father said I should not do that, though, since it will negate our leverage in contract negotiations if we come to that. 

My thought is that if he doesn't have a license, we can prosecute him criminally and have him pay me back as a stipulation from pre-trial intervention. 

I don't trust this person, as he has lied about everything in my dealings with him, and has not shown even the slightest shred of moral character. Despite this, I would hate to take food from the mouths of an indigent person and his children. 

Am I the asshole for suing this supposed electrician? Are my actions what you would call letigeous? I kind of hate myself for going through this route. I don't want to cause harm to anyone. I'm furious and possibly bloodthirsty right now, so trying to keep my composure here is difficult. What do you believe to be a good course of action? 

TL;DR: An indigent, untrustworthy ""electrician"" destroyed almost the entirety of my assets. He doesn't have much, and I hate having to go through a legal route to see myself restored, but see no alternative. Am I the asshole here? 

Thank you in advance for your time and attention in reading this.","Are you the asshole? No. You just got swindled.

As far as getting money out of him? You can try but he probably works off the books. Guys like him usually want to be paid in cash.  There will be no money in any accounts for the courts to give you. He's probably already got rulings against him that haven't been paid, honestly.

Put bad reviews online, report him to state authorities, but your money is probably gone and never coming back.

"AITA for being a 'dick' by not giving a girl my hoodie?. Was walking home from school today after debate practice. I live in a pretty cold state, and while it wasn't excessively cold or anything, it was cold-ish. I was wearing a hoodie and shorts. This girl, let's call her Kate, who lives in my neighborhood decided to tag along with me even though her friends offered to give her a ride. For whatever reason, she was wearing a tank top and those short Nike running shorts all the girls at my school seem to wear, so obviously she was more cold than I was. 

I'm 90% sure Kate likes me, both because of how she acts towards me (bring flirty, always finding excuses to get alone with me, texting me in the middle of the night, sending me thirst trap selfies on sc she tries to disguise as streaks, etc) and through what I've heard from other people. I don't really like her back, and don't really care either way about her or her supposed crush. 

Anyhow, she was walking alongside me and started 'hinting' about how cold it was. I could obviously see where this was going, but didn't really want to give her my hoodie because 1) Its my favorite hoodie, and as people say, when you give a girl a hoodie, it's as good as gone 2) I don't want to be cold and 3) She might see my giving her my hoodie as a sign of interest or something. So I ignored her signals. She kept on talking more and more about the weather, which was annoying, until I finally snapped and replied sarcastically, 'what do you want me to do? Control the weather?'

She got pissed and told me she just wanted my hoodie. I told her no, which pissed her off more. She's the type to go quiet and fume when angry, and that's exactly what she did, but apparently she texted her friends about it, since now they're all texting me calling me an asshole.

"AITA for continuing to ski when the rest if our group left. We booked a family ski trip to Utah last spring with my family and my SIL and BIL's family. My family had been skiing for the last few years and were decently good at it. The rest of the family were newbies who had never gone skiing before. My wife doesn't really like to ski and usually plans a girls trip when I take the kids for a ski trip.

We get to the ski resort right when it opens and buy our lift passes(full day). We have our own equipment that we managed to haul all the way over here. So we start skiing and my wife decides to take a beginners lesson since she hasn't been skiing in forever. 

The beginners were at the base doing the basic exercises. It was a warm day (39F) and it was sunny. I knew that this was not the day to dress in 3 layers and cover every bit of skin. I warned the rest of the group and they didn't listen. They were sweating their asses off and they called it quits after lunch. They decided to go back to the hotel, rest and head out to go sight seeing. My wife followed them since she wasn't a big fan of skiing anyways. Me and my kids had bought lift passes for the full day and had no intention of leaving early. As we left the resort the convo went like this.

"AITA for not taking my kids to their grandparents for Christmas tomorrow?. Tomorrow is Christmas at my parents house. I have 6 kids, aged 15 down to 5. Ive been awake since 4am and I am leaning towards not taking them to their grandparents house for Christmas tomorrow. AITA?


My parents are right wing evangelical Christians, Republicans, a little bit racist, you know the type. My  mom has spent most of her life trying to make people feel shame and guilt. We grew up in an environment of shame with religion as the biggest pillar. Christian school, church, etc. 

Much like a person who grows up in domestic violence will marry an abuser, I married a right wing fundamentalist. At first we were both young and in love with our whole lives ahead of us. But then she took a hard right turn, hating Democrats and Muslims and gay people. I didn’t make that right turn with her and the shame and guilt came back. She became the type of person I hated and then I started hating myself for being with her. I left home in February of 2017. She told the kids that I left them and there was so much propaganda. My kids didn’t want to see me or come over at first at all. I didn’t talk bad about my ex so they only heard one side and there were hard feelings. 

Today I rent an old farmhouse in the country with string lights on the back deck and Otis Redding blasting and I have found peace. For me that meant giving up religion entirely. No more laying awake feeling like I wasn’t enough to God (We have all sinned and come short of the glory of God the Bible says. Just by being born we aren’t enough) I wasn’t enough to my parents, I wasn’t enough to my wife. I wasn’t enough to myself. It took a lot of work with my therapist. At the beginning of 2019 he asked me my goals and I said I wanted to be a better person. He said, I will never forget what he said as long as I live, he said “I don’t want you to be a better person. I love you just the way you are brother.” I cried so hard. Right there. I let it all go. I think that was the first moment I ever felt loved unconditionally. 

When I am with my parents I don’t see the good in myself. I see the boy who came up short. For me its been the healthiest to limit my time with them. My mom is very manipulative and she can be mean. My daughter didn’t hug her right away last time so my mom kept telling her she can get her own stuff. This week my kids got a mean letter from my mom where she accused my ten year old of lying to her about ballet times. She is ten! Last night my oldest read the letter from her and then she felt bad about herself and I started thinking, damn, I don’t want my kids to go through what I have had to. Its also the time. My time with my kids is so precious. When I get to have them over I get the house all clean and I put little prizes on their beds and I put my phone away and I am in the moment and I love the time with them. I don’t know if I want to spend it in a situation that might be unhealthy. But I also want my kids to know their grandparents. AITA if I just skipped Christmas?","Absolutely NTA.

"WIBTA if I report a first aid instructor who I believe to be a bad teacher?. Preface: I'm a teacher and therefore have a fairly thorough knowledge of teaching methods.

Today I went to a first aid course. Not run by the Red Cross, but my current employer sent me so I didn't get to choose. The teacher was an older fella, accountant for most of the week, who very much cares deeply about this work. He's been doing first aid courses in the area for years.

And though his book knowledge was good, his teaching was abysmal. A few examples:

Made fun of people for misunderstanding directions;

Prefaced a *lot* of sexist comments with ""not to be sexist, but..."". Made other sexist comments too, seemingly without realising it. Also ""randomly"" chose the young, pretty woman to be his patient around half the time. As a big fella with a beard, I was never called upon for some reason;

When teaching us the stable side position (renamed from the recovery position years ago - he still called it the recovery position) he had the whole class do what they thought was right first, had us stop and return to the line when we made a mistake, not tell us what the mistake was, and just move on down the line. All this before teaching us what it was for or why it was useful;

Spent at least a third of the time repeating information or adding personal anecdotes, or hectoring us to diet and exercise. Didn't really seem to have a timetabled structure for the class, which was an eight-hour day. If he had one, he didn't follow it;

Gave students the answers during the test. That young pretty woman did not get the knowledge at all, so he told her the answer then marked it correct;

Didn't even teach slings. Implied heavily that they were useless at first-aider level;

Told us we all passed the final assessment without taking it because we'd reached the end of the slated class time.

Probably others, but it's been a long day.

I noted in the course evaluation that his content knowledge was good and his teaching style was not. I obviously didn't put all these examples. 

The reason I'm pondering is this: his content knowledge *is* good. Nothing he said, even in the personal anecdotes, was wrong per se. I *did* learn. All but one person in the class I would trust to do first aid on me or anyone I love. He's done a whole lot of good in the community with this work, including bringing the price for businesses to buy 24/365 publically available defibrillators down by $300. The other people who took the class today travelled a long way to attend and I don't know if they would have the chance to resit these tests if it came to that. 

Will I be the asshole if I call the first aid company and lay this out? I feel the claims I would make are enough to have him investigated and possibly fired. Any tests he has administered or certificates he has given would be under suspicion, which will impact who knows how many people.

Edit: if anyone asks a question I'll have to get to it in the morning. I am a very tired man.","NTA.

"AITA for not wanting to pay weed to my gf?. We live together for 4 months, we are both 22, her cousin came to visit, asked me to buy him five grams, she gave me the money I got a good deal with a guy I know, he left and said he actually just wanted 4 and he was gonna leave one and only paid for 4 grams.

She gets home and tells me “do you want to buy this gram from me?” And I obviously said no, since she smokes my weed for more than one year and I never asked a cent for it, and now she wants me to buy that weed from her that she will later probably smoke from it too!

"AItA for being accepting to my friend?. This is a complicated one.  I'm not sure if I'm the asshole because I'm too judgmental, or because I'm enabling someone who's done something I consider despicable, or neither.  I'll try to TL;DR each paragraph.   

Tl;DR 1: **As an individual, I am pro life.**  I know it's a pipe dream, but it's my personal hope that not a single other abortion ever happens again in human history (and that includes the equally ridiculous underlying hope that there are no more rapes or cases of incest that cause unwanted pregnancy, etc. etc.).  Just to complicate matters, if I were in government, I would have to vote pro-choice, because I cannot possibly convince myself that the government should claim the right to force a person to go through the medical and emotional ordeal of carrying an unwanted child, under any circumstance. 

TL:DR 2: **One of my very best friends had a completely elective abortion, and I have only been supportive, and only expressed concern for the possible emotional impact on her.**  She was living with the guy for years when this happened.  She was finished school and employed. As was he. There were no medical problems.  There were no relationship problems.  There was no sexual assault.  She married him a year later, and now they ""want kids"".  She just said the time wasn't right.  I assume all this info is true, because she was never showing, and didn't need to tell me anything about the pregnancy but told me the story anyway.  

TL:DR 3: **I am constantly silently ashamed of the fact that I have never breathed a word of disapproval to her over this.**  I really don't know what I think I should do, but I know that if I had a friend and I saw him stab a stranger to death in the street and he somehow was found innocent at trial, I would ostracize him.  I would no longer count him as a friend or associate with him if I could help it.  I would have to do something to say that that shit isn't cool, and I have no interest in associating with someone capable of that.  In my mind, abortion without extreme extenuating circumstances is an order of magnitude more heinous act; the victim is infinitely more innocent and defenseless, and the killer is infinitely more directly responsible for that victim's protection.  It's just not a crime the law can punish. 

So, assholery judges...is it fucked up that I basically let it slide?  Is it fucked up that I even think I shouldn't?  Or is my part in this all ok?","In your view, it was murder.

"WIBTA if I exchanged a gifted experience?. For my birthday last year, a few people chipped in to buy me a Sports Car Racing experience gift card.

"WIBTA if I sold a custom made computer and a dog house I currently have for collateral?. So basically I decided to be a ""good"" person and help someone out. They were very adamant to pay me $1000. I agreed. The ""job"" consisted me basically flying across the country, putting my own life on hold, and driving them back to where I was so they could move. I only agreed to this because this person had no other way of getting out of the environment they were in, and needed out ASAP. The details don't matter. What does matter, is I've only been paid 500 bucks upon arrival. I was suppose to get the other 500 by the time I got back with them. (for clarification the 500 is ALL I'VE RECEIVED!)  


To add to this financial stab, their credit card got declined on getting a car, so I put up 500 bucks on a credit card to cover the car cost. And to add to that, I had to purchase 2 nights of hotels for them while they found some where to live..  


I currently have their computer and their expensive elaborate dog house, this person has put in what seems to be zero effort to get a job. I had to get a second job to try and get my head above the water. I'm currently owned 1300 dollars. I know the computer was custom made and a lot was put into it, and I know the dog house could pull in a couple hundred based on its design. I'm not sure if I'll break even or not, but I'm tired of going day to day and them not putting in any effort to try and pay me back.   


This person is also very manipulative and controlling. I study psychology and I see several manipulative tactics used by them to the point where I'm ready to block the number and cut ties completely.

"AITA for refusing to meet my ex’s new girlfriend?. My ex and I broke up when our daughter was a newborn after it came out that he had cheated on me with multiple women when I was pregnant. 
Despite that, we’ve always managed to get along really well and coparent effectively. 

He’s recently moved in with a girlfriend, and he doesn’t understand why I won’t meet her. 

He’s 28. She’s 45. She’s actually the same age as his mother, which if I’m being honest I find a bit strange.
I’ve never met her or had any interaction with her, but for the past several months she used to watch my Instagram story religiously. When I told him I found that strange he asked me to block her.  I’m a bit weirded out by the whole thing. 

He claims they’ve been together 8 months so this is a serious relationship and he wants us all to get along. Yet for the entire time they’ve been together he’s sent me flirty and suggestive texts and made sexual advances in person, so I just can’t take their relationship seriously. 

My daughter lives with me full time and according to our causal visitation rules our daughter isn’t supposed to be around significant others during parenting time so I see no reason to have any kind of relationship with this woman.

"AITA for suing for my legally entitled inheritance?. Quick life story. Mum and dad apparently were very wild in their younger years (would've gone to woodstock if it were in their country).

Today his training was to follow a server and learn what they do. He shadowed me for 20 minutes and I walked him through what I was doing. At one point, he was watching me enter information into our computer so I had my little notebook on the counter open.

I was closing so it was only my general manager, the MIT, and I. My manager was on the floor and I was doing my final paperwork with the MIT.  He handed me my money and said I owed $4 to the restaurant.

Right after he tells me that, he reached into the apron I’m wearing, grabs my notebook, throws it in the thrash, and tells me to buy a new one.

"AITA for ruining the relationship of my fiance with her mum?. Throwaway account because some friends are on reddit and might recognize us.

So I have a genetic condition causing a noticable assymetry in my face. When I was younger I used to get very self consious about it and I hated how I look. Since growing up though I realised that my self worth is not only determined by how I look and that I have no reason to be ashamed of something out of my control. I don't feel like my condition influences my relationships with friends and coworkers aside from brief questions when I meet new people.

I have been dating my fiance for 5 years and we plan to get married. Ever since her mother found out that I have a genetic desease she basically hated me and wanted us to break up. She comes from a cultur which puts lots of emphasis on physical appearance. She wanted me to get a consultation about wheter my genetic condition is hereditary and I consented.

I do understand that she wants to know the risk if my fiance and I decide to have children. Lately she has been suggesting me to get a major surgery to reconstruct my face. She even says that she will refuse to come to the wedding if I do not do this. This is something though I categorically refuse. My reasoning for this is the following:

    There are risk just as with any major surgery. Also my self image is obviously tied to how I look now. I might not even like how I look even if in the best case my face came of symmetric without complications.

    If is my body and I feel extremely violated of her (my fiances mother) to suggest this and even urge me to do this by threatening not coming to our wedding.

    I very much doubt her motives. She says it is to improve my self image but if so she should be able to accept if I just do not want to do this. I strongly believe it is only about how her friends and family will think about her. Like how could her daughter marry someonly like me.

Reason being: I’m pregnant, and I look like shit. I’ve never loved my face and they know that I’m sensitive about close-up candid photos, but especially now. I LOVE being pregnant because this is a VERY wanted and difficult-to-achieve pregnancy. And I happen to be “showing” in my face.

So I told him “sorry I really don’t want to be in a photo right now.” He said “I don’t care.” So in a reflex I could barely control, I shoved my entire head in the neck hole of my sweater and repeated “I’m not going to have my face in that photo.”

I heard my sister in law say “wait, she’s serious?” And everyone asking me why. I responded (coming out of my sweater halfway “I feel like a solid 2 right now, I have giant bloated jowls.” I only said this because I was asked, but my sister in law said something along the lines of “now that you’re pregnant it’s not about you” or something like that.

I would rather have him gone. We want to take him to a rehab, but he refuses and starts cursing at us. My parents are not as mad as me because he only steals my stuff. He'll try to come back and knowing my parent's they let him back in. I could tip the police and get him arrested and probably deported. I know he carrys a weapon and his crack pipe. I want this cycle to end, but I dont have much options. I would like to move out, but that wont happen for atleast another year. I've also tried hiding my stuff, but he snoops around.

"AITA for accidentally getting a black girl punished for sexual harassment?.

"AITA for scaring and injuring a coworker for trying to prank me?. Okay, basic background info; I work retail and have an irregular schedule. I don't mind a good prank, but will try to turn one around on you if I catch you in the act.

&#x200B;

Recently I had an early morning shift starting at 5:30 am, I am not a morning person and was dead tired by the time of my first break, exhausted by lunch time. On my lunch break I very quickly stuffed my face full of food, set an alarm on my phone and tried to take a nap in the break room as it was the only spot I could do so.

&#x200B;

Sometime during my nap a coworker got the idea to play a small prank on me. I had my eyes closed and listened as she whispered (loudly) to another coworker that she was gonna get me with the air horn app on her phone.

&#x200B;

I thought that this would be a great time to get some preemptive revenge. So, when she got closer to me and started lifting her phone to my ear I jumped up out of my chair and shouted real loud.

&#x200B;

That made her lose her balance and fall over, she tried to catch herself and ended up pulling a table down on her hip among other small injuries. Nothing broken, no cuts, just some bruises as far as anyone has told me.

&#x200B;

The rest of the shift and the few days since she's been complaining to our managers that I'm abusive and rude. HR has stepped in and tried to resolve the issue. I have apologized for causing her injury, but feel that she was kind of asking for it by trying to scare me out of my nap. My coworkers are split on the issue; some think she deserved it, others think I'm a massive d-bag for it.

"AITA for cutting out a guy I know after he tried to share whiskey with me at school?. I've known this kid for a while. Really down to earth guy. Good intentions and all that. Last year (we play hockey) at a tournament, I had a great team with a lot of rowdy players and we had a party in one cabin, while the other adults had a party in another. This kid I'm referring to, Mike was at this party as well. Everyone had some form of drink. And of course he's a lightweight so he has 3 beers and is out cold. Whatever. I'm not really feeling it so I'm just chilling. This was what I guess was the ""turning point"" I guess, because between then and now all Mike wants to talk about is ""getting wasted this Friday"" or some stupid shit like that. Fast forward to the beginning of school, I have physics with Mike, and we sit together. Every day he's inviting me to his house which is within walking distance to crack a cold one or something like that. I kept just forwarding the conversation (""yeah sure"", ""sounds like fun"", ""sure"") cause I thought he was joking. Couple days later he's talking about this ice tea he's got and it's sooooo good and how I need to try it.

So a few days ago I'm like ""damn I haven't really hung out with him"", so at lunch we decide to walk down to the gas station to get candy. We meet up, Mike pulls out this ice tea bottle and tells me to have a sip. I uncap it and it's obviously whiskey. I called him a fucking dumbass, put the cap back on and threw it in the bush. I just walked away, and mind you he was taking a couple swigs as he walked up to me, and I wanted no part of that, especially at lunch at school on a Wednesday. He's tried to talk to me but I don't say anything cause I think he's really stupid. He also asked me why I hang out with my friend group. Y'know, the people I've known since elementary school.

So I was waiting at Walgreen's pharmacy to pick up my medication for a cold/double ear infection/sinus infection straight-out-of-hell combo, and I was second in line.

A girl who I didn’t know too well was there too. She introduced herself and talked for a bit and it was nice, but I wasn’t attracted to her or anything like that. 

Later that weekend, I go out to the bars with my friends and she’s there again in the same group as me. She starts flirting with me pretty hard.

"AITA for not forgiving my extended family after they ditched us on a family holiday. Here’s the backstory. My dad has 2 siblings and older brother and a younger sister. We were always so close yet now we’ve strayed further and further away. Our family lives in Australia whilst the other 2 families live in Indonesia, in different cities. So we hardly see each other. 

After a years of hardly meeting each other we made a plan to invite them to Australia and spend 10 days here. 

Leading up to the plan, a few months before around April, my Uncle had an operation and we were told that they could no longer come to Australia because they didn’t have enough money post operation. 

The days when they were supposed to come to Australia, they told us that they were going to go  to Hong Kong the following day, both families, without us. They didn’t tell us, didn’t invite us and IMO the guilt was dead real when they started spamming the group chat with their holiday photos and tried to act like nothing happened.

Until this day they still haven’t apologised. I tried many different ways in trying to think about why they did it. I haven’t heard their side of the story and we ended up meeting them last week in Indonesia, it was an awkward “act like nothing happened” family gathering and everyone else in my family besides me acted like nothing happened.

I don’t know if I’m wrong in not forgiving them, every time I think about what they did it pisses me off. I don’t want to get into deep detail but I’ve thought about it heaps for ages and the general conclusion is that they simply just went “fk it, lets go without them”, last minute they felt guilty or they were scared we would find out and told us.",NTA.

"WIBTA If I accepted my Grandmothers inheritance leaving the rest of my family with nothing.. I am not from an English speaking country, so if my spelling sucks, that is why.

So I come from an entirelly messed up family, we are talking bad parenting, favouritism, mental illnesses and alcoholism. As a result of that I ended up cutting contact with all of my family at 18, I was always the black sheep where as my sister and brother were the favoured children, I look nothing like them so I assume this was because I am likely the result of my mother cheating. My siblings were active participants in this stuff hence why I cut them out as well, also they are all around terrible people.

My sister however has 2 children, the first one she had at 16 and the other one at 18, she was a terrible mother when I still lived at home but regardless the kids are the only reason I am questioning myself.

My grandmother had a change of heart 3 years ago, she became religious, turned what was left of her life around and as a result of her religion felt like she needed to apologise to me and try and salvage a relationship. I was not in the least bit interested at first, but it seemed she was serious about it all so eventually I gave her a chance, this led to us being very close during the last year of her life.

She died a while back and I learned I had inherited basically everything, to my surprise it was a lot, she owned an apartment complex, her house, a bunch of investments and a few hundred thousand in savings, I always knew she was well off due to Grandpa but I never knew she was this well off.

As for me, I own my own house, work from home, have considerable savings and I am essentially the only one of my direct family who can be considered well off as a result I have no real need of so much money and assets. Where as my parents, aunts, brother, sister and their kids are poverty ridden, this money could change their lives. As a result my sister has been begging me to decline the inheritance not for her but for her kids and I am having a hard time with it all, if it wasn't fir the kids it would be an easy no, but as it stands the kids live in poverty and I feel for them, on the other end, I owe my family nothing and I barely know my sisters kids and this money would allow me to be secure for the rest of my life and if I choose to ever have kids of my own it would secure their future as well.

So render onto me thy judgement","NTA

"AITA for snapping at my fiancé’s mom and getting us kicked out the house?. INFO: We are both guys. I am gay, my fiancé is bi.

My fiancé proposed to me last month. We’re on a trip to the Netherlands to meet his family. We live in the U.S., his family knows *of* me, but we’ve never met.

My fiancé hadn’t seen his mother since he was 18 (he’s 26 now). He said that he and his mother were never really close.

We were originally planning to stay in a hotel room for the entire trip but his mother insisted that we stay at the house for the night and leave for the hotel in the morning. He hadn’t seen her in 8 years, I suggested that we stay with her.

We arrived and were greeted by his sisters. They were all very welcoming and also seemed happy about the engagement. 

His mother was the opposite. The first thing she did was turn to my fiancé and say,”I thought that you would’ve brought a girl.”

My fiancé completely ignored her statement. She said something about dinner and walked off. I didn’t get to introduce myself.

Dinner. My fiancé’s mom kept making remarks. “Why my fiancé couldn’t ‘at least find an attractive man?’, amongst other things.

This women somehow managed to hit every single insecurity of mine, and I was starting to get upset.

Maybe it showed. My boyfriend excused the both of us from the table and he asked me if I was okay. I told him that I was fine. He said that we can leave if his mother was making me uncomfortable. I inisisted that I was okay. I could last the night.

Then came time to retire. We were going up my fiancé’s room when his mother *kindly* offered me the couch.

My fiancé said that he’d be sharing a room with me, she made excuses, my fiancé walked away. Few minutes later, she swung open the door.!She said something about wanting us to keep it open ? She said she didn’t trust me.

This women was getting on my nerves. I snapped. “We’re not teenagers, but if you want to see us fuck so badly, you’re welcome to stay”, along with a few other choice words. She had a fit. She told me that I wasn’t welcome here anymore.

She told my fiancé to stay, but my fiancé said he was leaving with me. She started yelling at him, mostly insults about ‘his choice in men’. We left and now we’re spending the night in the rental car.

My fiancé told me not to feel bad about what I said, and that she had it coming. But I still feel like a jerk because:

"AITA for not allowing my son to go to church with his friend anymore?. Hello everyone. Throwaway for privacy, and my husband will be reading these responses as well. 

Our son Jake has been best friends with Sam for four years. They are both 15 years old. About three years ago Sam's parents asked us if we would be alright with Jake going to church with them on Sunday so that our boys could have sleepovers there on Saturdays and we readily agreed. House to ourselves every other weekend? Yes please! On the other weekends, Sam sleeps over with us on Fridays. This is a decently consistent schedule during the school year. 

Please note that Jake fully supported this and wanted to learn about religion as his father and I are non-believers. We have nothing against religion and we were initially excited to see him wanting to explore his beliefs.

About a year ago Jake began making comments that we were not fond of. Example: ""If you do X, you'll go to hell."" He would say this in response to us ""gossiping"" (talking about an actor), saying words like ""asshole"" (which, fair, I'll give him that one), and punishing him for bad behavior/grades (taking away his playstation). This escalated to him judging how we live and conduct ourselves, because we do not adhere to ""normal"" church behaviors. Example: My husband does the laundry, which my son said is not a man's duty.

At that point, we sat him down and had a long discussion on sexism, gender roles, etc. The whole nine yards. My husband and I also had a conversation with Sam's parents which we thought went over well. 

Except his behavior hasn't changed, only became less targeted. He quoted the bible at us last week when I wouldn't let him practice driving. He quoted it again when my husband opened a beer. And again when my sister and I mentioned a current hot button topic.

I'm done. We're done. We told him that if he was going to use his religious beliefs/knowledge in such a way, then he could no longer attend church. We spoke with Sam's parents about having sleepovers be only on Fridays at either house, but now they're mad because they think we're judging them for their beliefs/way of life and are putting us on blast all over Facebook. But it's only because our son apparently isn't mature enough at 15 (I *know* this is ridiculous) to handle religion, I swear. We've lost two mutual friends over this situation and Sam isn't allowed at our house anymore (their decision) so at this point I'm doubting our decision to pull him from church because this is a lot of shit to deal with. Jake, of course, says he hates us.

"AITA for calling my sister on her bull shit. Some background before get into the story: my older sister has considered herself an adult since she was 16, she even tried to move out one month before she turned 18 and then proceeded to call the police saying that my parents ""kicked her out"", all because her toxic friend told her to. So we've been having some problems in the past.

A couple months later she turned 18 and moved into her toxic friends house (let's call this friend Gonzo) because ""mom and dad are so strict and unfair"". When my sister lived with us she did nothing to contribute to the house, she was constantly leaving her stuff on the floor, left messes in the bathroom, unsorted the laundry, left dirty dishes everywhere, and left our little brother (who is 3) ALONE for an hour or two to have sex with her boyfriend (who was uninvited). She has also invited him over to our aunt's house, during our cousins birthday party, and proceeded to get into the shower with him, AT OUR AUNTS HOUSE. 

So she moves into Gonzo's house, but she keeps trash talking our parents. She saw me not eating lunch at school and said something like ""are mom and dad not feeding you? They're so neglectful, who doesn't feed their fucking kid"". She saw me with new drawing pensils and flipped out, saying that mom and dad didn't ever buy her anything, among other things. Lately she has been making fun of not only my weight, but our little sisters weight ( she's 13 and 110 lbs).

The final straw is when she started to bully my freshman friend, calling her a whore and a bitch, all because my friend said she thought Ganzo was a bad influence.

Ganzo and some others say that I'm over thinking it and making it a bigger deal than it really is, that it's not really my problem.  Would that make me the asshole for getting involved?

"AITA for refusing to engage with my co-workers' small talk?. Personally, I can't stand small talk, but my workplace thrives on it. I work in a small office in a larger shared space, and there are only 7 of us total. Most of us work in different fields, so conversations about our work are generally off the table, which is understandable. 

&#x200B;

When I started working here about 2.5 months ago,  I entertained the small talk mostly because I hadn't gotten to know any of them well enough yet to talk about anything else. But I've started to notice that even though we've had more significant topics about shared common interests (sports, television/movies, etc.), whenever a conversation begins they opt for vapid, generic topics like the weather or what we're going to eat for lunch.

&#x200B;

It's also not just small talk: it's meaningless remarks that I honestly have no idea how to reply to anymore. For example, whenever I use the copier (which is every day) the person who works closest to the copier asks me, ""having fun?"". The first few times I used to joke around and say I was having so much fun I was worried I'd wake up the next day with a hangover, but I've been asked if I'm ""having fun"" every single day for nearly three months. 

&#x200B;

They also regularly come into my office and interrupt my work for the sake of small talk, and if I don't immediately give them my attention they will linger in my doorway staring at me until I ask them what's up and if they need anything, but given the fact that we all work different jobs (just share the office), there is very little reason for them to demand my attention like that and every single time they do, it's only to engage it more meaningless banter.

&#x200B;

Over the past couple of weeks I've begun to reply with single-syllable words, ""mhmm"", or just flat-out ignore it. I've even mentioned in the past to them that small talk really doesn't cut it for me. The types of conversation they insist upon have become insufferable to the point where I've started ""working through lunch"" most days (aka hiding in my office browsing reddit while I eat) instead of eating with them.

This arrived dented because the royal mail is a bit shit and they aren't sending me a new figure it issuing even a partial refund for a situation that, in all fairness, was their fault.

So now I'm £15 down (which in my situation is a fair bit) with nothing to show for it and I'm kinda pissed, so I'm planning on sending anywhere between outwardly pissed and passive aggressive, so Reddit, WIBTA?","NTA it was their fault so they should still send out the correct figure. You paid for something that you didn't get. File a dispute with eBay they usually side with buyers anyway. You have proof you didn't receive what you paid for.

Although sending something fragile like that just in bubble wrap and paper was risky in the first place.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for not going to my (ex) best friend’s wedding after she kicked me out of the wedding party?. Here it goes: my (now ex) best friend, we’ll call her Dora, got engaged and I, being her best friend, was asked to be her Maid of Honour (MOH). I gladly accepted. Did all the planning with the bridesmaids earlier this year. Everything looked good and I was just trying to be supportive, as a MOH should.

Then some drama happened with us, completely unrelated to the wedding but it caused a lot of tension between Dora and I, enough so that she was extremely “livid” with my actions and although I was completely apologetic and willing to fix what I did wrong, she ultimately decided that she didn’t “need a maid of honour right now” and that I was “still part of the bridal party as a bridesmaid” and  that I am “an important part” of her life. This broke me and I was severely depressed for weeks after. This mistake I made put a huge strain on our once tight friendship.

The bridal shower and bachelorette were awkward af since Dora doesn’t do confrontation, and she never once tried to talk to me and here my sad, broken little heart just moved forward making sure Dora had a great time. 

A couple weeks later, I tried to fix our drama. Dora thought I was acting out “against her”. I went on to explain the reasoning behind my decision and she decided that we were not communicating properly and that she wanted “positive vibes” on her wedding day so she told me she thinks I “should be a guest at the wedding” instead. This was 8 days before the wedding day. I was in tears, once again, and decided to tell her how I felt. I told her how she broke my heart and how I would never do anything to ruin her special day. I was upset and hurt and I wanted her to know that, but all she did was leave me on read. She didn’t try to contact me or even attempt to work through anything in the days that followed.

I decided then that I would not attend her wedding. I didn’t even tell anyone, I just didn’t show up. My entire family was invited cause my sister was also a bridesmaid too, and they agreed with my decision, but some of our mutual friends thought I was rude and selfish by not telling her and not showing up as it was her big day and I was a paid guest, even though I sent her a money card to cover the cost of me + my date since we didn’t show up. So I need to know AITA here?

"AITA for reporting my neighbors to the cops?. Let’s preface the with saying that my neighbors are jerks. They have snitched on me to HOA several times. So on July 4th they decided to put some fireworks and smoke bombs. Both of them are illegal on my area, and we were advised to call the non-emergency police number. So I decided to call the number, and report them. 

I think it went too far since they were fined 500 dollars, and given a warning. I don’t feel that shitty about it, but I think I might’ve made a mistake.","NTA

"AITA for not giving my friend ownership of our server?. 
5 of my friends and i make a team in which we produce content, in which we had a discord server which i owned for our fans. our server was pretty small with maybe 100 people. in late november some ‘drama’ happened with one of our server members; maybe 20 people in the server were agitated because of a 12 year old member and what he did. we were split on how to punish this kid. one of our team members who i’ll refer to as #1 was biased towards the 12 year old and got incredibly mad over the situation. she yelled things along the lines of “i fucking hate this server!” and “we should delete this one and make a new one!”; then eventually we did after we got majority approval. on the new server, said 12 year old was still allowed and #1 was now the owner. only a day or two after the new server was made and the old one was deleted, more drama about the 12 year old happened. the entire team agreed on banning him. at some point, #1 unbanned him, causing me and another one of our admins to leave the server in frustration. admin #1 dmed me later apologizing for unbanning the 12 year old and asking me to take ownership back; she said that she “thinks [im] better for this sorta thing”. i took ownership back since she has anger issues and trouble controlling her actions when angry.

all was fine after this until #1 and another admin started spamming me and asking to give #1 ownership back. i said no because they were incredibly rude, immature, and i was afraid #1 could possibly lash out again or do something irrational with ownership.

today #1 asked again for ownership back and when i proceeded to say no, she left the server in protest along with another admin; she rejoined and she asked me if there’s any way to convince me to give her ownership back.

TLDR; my friend was angry about drama and asked to delete the server i owned but we all shared; said friend owned the new server until she gave me ownership back because of her anger issues and is now asking for ownership again.",NTA - Your #1 is unstable and problematic and should not be the owner of the server.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA if I didnt give up my table for an elderly couple?. So today I was Disney Springs with my gf because she had a job interview at a retail shop (Uniqlo). I tagged along because we figured after her interview we can hit the parks( We have annual passes). While she was in the interview, I was sitting in an area with tables meant for people just to sit and relax. All the tables were taken with families but I managed to find an empty one and sat there.

A few minutes passed and this elderly man and his wife came up asked me if they could have my table so that they could rest their legs. He said they asked me because I was alone at my table and all the others were taken. 

I said ""Sir, I have to wait for here a little bit for someone and I told them I'd be waiting here so I don't really want to move but you and your wife are more than welcome to join me and sit in the other seats at the table.""

He looked at me and said ""My wife and I would really like some privacy and I think since you're young and can walk easier you should let us sit here""

I said ""Sir I'm sorry I don't think it's fair that you feel you have the right to this table just because of your age but like I said I really don't mind you guys sitting here with me since the seats are empty.""

We went back and forth for a few more remarks until eventually he said ""Nevermind, clearly your parents didn't teach you to respect your elders."" Then him and his wife left and walked away.

I feel kind of bad because I don't want them to not rest, but also they both seemed to be in fine condition and I don't think it's right for them to expect me to give up the table. 

Am I the asshole?",NTA.  You offered a reasonable solution - share the table.  He was rude to reject that and try to push you out of your seat. ,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA if I continue to date my ex step daughter’s friend. Two years ago I (45) divorced my ex wife (47). We were married 14 years and have two sons, 11 and 8, together, and most of our marriage was great but she’s a very emotionally distant and private person, which drove a wedge between us. My ex wife also has a daughter from a previous relationship, let’s call her Betty, who is 26. I lived with my wife not far from the only major city in our area, where Betty happens to live too. In the two years since I’ve been here, Betty has made no effort to contact me or maintain a relationship with me, which I understand and have accepted. 6 months ago I started dating Emily, 28. She’s, bright, kind, and mature, but in a way that doesn’t diminish her youthful excitement and curiosity about life. She is truly beautiful in every sense. Emily brought me to a work party recently. It’s a close small staff, and with Emily having no family nearby, this felt like a big situation to us. I arrive and lo and behold, who do I see there but my ex step daughter Betty. I admit I was kind of excited. I love her and watched her grow up and have missed her, but she was cold and distant. The next day I received a slew of messages from her threatening to ruin my relationship with my sons if I don’t end things with Emily. On the one hand, I love Emily and these threats are probably empty, as I have a good relationship with my sons and my ex isn’t the vengeful type, but on the other hand, I love my kids and can’t risk them no matter how small the risk, and I am also starting to feel the tiniest bit weird about Emily and i’s age difference. I really do love her, but AITA if I stay with her?","Dude.. NTA but the age difference is kid of weird.

"AITA for making a guy prove he’s real before dating him?. i’m a woman, so i try to be very careful with online dating, so i don’t get hurt. i recently met this guy on a site, and gave him my snap eventually. he only ever sent me saved pictures, and so i asked him today if he could send me a picture of him with two fingers on his nose, so i knew this guy was the age he said he was, was the person in the pictures he had sent me etc. and he got mad at me, saying it hurt that we had been talking for so long and i didn’t trust him. i tried explaining that i did want to see if i could get our relationship farther, but i wanted to rest assured that he was a good person, and not a fifty year old guy catfishing me. he gets super offended that i “think he’s a fifty year old” and says that i’m being unreasonable.

"AITA for refusing my mom's ""help"". I was hungry, so I decided to make myself some food. I needed to boil water. I searched for a pot and picked out the first one I saw in the kitchen. I took one of the newer/good pots that had non-stick coating on it. According to my mom, boiling water in these types of pots causes the non-stick coating to wear down easily. Normally, I wouldn't have picked out this pot for boiling, but the other pot I usually use was dirty. I figured it wouldn't be a big deal to use the good pot just once.   


After a couple minutes of heating the pot on the stove, my mom scolded me for using the newer pot, and told me about a third pot that I should've used instead. Complying, I found the third pot (which I hadn't noticed before) and figured that I could just transfer the water over to finish my cooking. While I rinsed out the third pot, my mom removed the good pot from the stove. I told her twice to just leave it on the stove so that the water would continue heating up, but she wouldn't listen to me. After I finished rinsing out the third pot, I put it on the stove and tried to take the pot filled with water from my mom. However, she wouldn't let go– turns out she wanted to help me pour the water. Without knowing her intentions at the time, I snatched the pot from my mom's hand and poured the water into the pot on the stove. 

My mom lost it. 

She yelled at me, saying that she was only trying to help me, and that all my life I've always been like this (unappreciative of her ""help""). I fired back and said that she was (physically standing) in my way. Internally, I felt as if she was micromanaging me over a menial task (which she's had a history of doing to me, especially when I'm making food in the kitchen). She was livid and ended up destroying a few plates and bowls over this matter.  


My dad and brother keep telling me to make amends and just apologize, but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong. AITA?","NTA holy shit, your mom is insane.

"AITA refused to give money to guy at gas station.  So I pulled in to a gas station to fill up yesterday and noticed a car pulled up close to another car that was parked at a pump. I observed the two parties talking and figured they were friends. As I was pumping gas I noticed the same car that I thought was a friend of the guy pumping gas, had made his way around the parking lot talking to all the patrons. Eventually he came to me and asked if I had any money I could spare. He had a story of how he was traveling from Kentucky to North Dakota and needed some help. My response was ""sorry I cant help ya man"", to which he responded "" thank you and God bless"". After I finished filling my tank I  pulled into a parking spot and got out of the car to smoke a cigarette. As I was returning to my vehicle this guy pulled behind me blocking me in and started yelling at me. He told me he didn't like the way I had responded to him and I was a bitch for responding the way I did ( I am a 6'5 250 pound white male) and that I was going to burn in hell and will reap what I sow when God judges me. He said the bible states to help thy brother and I am the reason people are freaking out nowadays. I told him I am an atheist and don't believe in your God. That made him very angry and  he proceeded to cuss me out for a good 5 minutes. Is this guy nuts or am I the asshole for not just giving in and paying him to go away.

"AITA for not giving up my seat. So, I am in the train which was fully booked and an older woman is sitting on my reserved seat. She tells me that she will move as soon as the train leaves, but actually shows not any intention to move.

The train is so full that we had a 30 minutes delay and all people without a reservation were kindly asked to leave.

30 minutes later and me standing next to her waiting for my spot, the train leaves. At that point I really wanted to sit, that's why I paid extra for a seat reservation and so I told her that she said she would leave.

Then she starts mocking how rude I am to take an old woman's seat and shamed me basically in front of the people around. My take on this is that I paid for it and she didn't even ask me if she could take my spot and just expected me to let it go.

Btw, she was physically in good shape and didn't look to have a problem to stand for a longer time.
