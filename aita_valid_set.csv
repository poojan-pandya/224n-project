66766,"AITA for not sitting at our assigned table at a restaurant?. This happened a while ago but my friend and I went to a Mexican restaurant for national margarita day. When we arrived the restaurant was crowded and there was a wait for a table so we decided to come back later. We came back and were able to get a table. While we were being escorted we noticed a group of our mutual friends sitting at another table and they invited us to sit with them since there was room. We decided to join them because we didn’t think it would be a big deal.

The waitress for that section comes by and looks irritated. I noticed her complaining to the manager about us sitting there and refusing to serve us so I’m guessing it might have been near the end of her shift. She comes to check on our friends but tells my friend and I that we would have to order drinks at the bar. We said that was fine but asked if we could order food. She became very indignant and went off on how we shouldn’t be sitting there and started aggressively touching my friend’s phone screen asking us if we saw what time it was. It was kind of late but the restaurant wasn’t about to close. We explained to her we didn’t know our friends would be here and the invited us to join them but she didn’t care at all. We shrugged it off and were able to get food and drinks at the bar.

We continue eating and the waitress gives one of my friends a drink but clinks the top of my friend’s marg glass who I came with and checks on a table near us. He makes a joke about him wondering if she did that on purpose to spill his drink. She overheard that and became more irate saying if she wanted to spill it on him she would have dumped it on his head. We started laughing and then she yells at us saying her manager is backing her up and we shouldn’t have been sitting there in the first place. The manager comes by asking us if everything was alright. We said it was fine. She probably had a stressful day and we chose not to complain. It seemed like the manager didn’t want to deal with her shit either so we wanted to save him a headache. 

I can understand why she wouldn’t want to serve us which was fine by me, but I thought her hostile attitude and threat to dump a drink on my friend was completely out of line. Are we really the a-holes for sitting with our friends?. Am I the asshole?","ESH. Sounds like she could have given better service, but they were also going to seat you guys in a certain place for a reason. It was rude of you to join them, especially if they were finishing up and you were just getting started.",1,0,1,0,0
21881,"WIBTA if I tell others at work he owes me money?. A few months ago I was doing ok financially and let my friend borrow $500 to see his dying mom. I don’t entirely know why he needed the money since his wife makes over $100k/year but I didn’t ask.

Fast forward, he kept saying he was going to pay me back, and did pay me $300.  During this time some personal things happened and I am barely scraping by. He got a job at a car dealership and kept calling me to talk about his enormous increase in income. 

A few days ago we met, but instead of paying me, he tried to get in my pants and bought me a $4 milkshake. He said I should call him/drop by work Friday afternoon so he could pay me. He didn’t answer his phone.

Today I have $7, a child to feed, and I need $60 for gas until my next paycheck. If I drop by the dealership I know I can find him, but I’ll have to ask for him. Would I be the asshole if I asked to see him because he owes me money?. Am I the asshole?",Woah he’s a cheater?,0,0,0,0,1
67210,"AITA for being pissed that a married friend confessed to having a crush on me?. I have a friend we'll call D, who is married to a woman L. We hadn't gotten together in a number of years, since D married L - a second marriage for both. D and I were chatting online, a few weeks before they'd be in town, and D said she had something to tell me. She said that she had, a while back, developed a huge crush on me (I am bisexual, which is sort of irrelevant, but anyway) and told her wife. D talked to her therapist about it, worked through it, and she and L were in a good place about it. She no longer had feelings for me, all was well with her and L.

Well, I was pretty irritated. My husband and I were supposed to be hanging out with them, but now I felt all weird about a marriage issue that I had been sort of pulled into. I mean, obviously people feel how they feel and I think that it was right of D to talk about this with L, but why tell me? What good could that do other than make me feel awkward about hanging out? This is the first time I'm meeting my friend's new wife, and I'm going in with this weird new information. 

I told my husband, who thought it was an odd thing to tell me, but thought I had no real reason to be mad about it. 

AITA for being upset at D for telling me this?. Am I the asshole?","NTA.  Way to make things awkward.  It sounds like D hasn't fully dealt with her crush, despite what she's said about the therapist, and is hoping you'll indicate that you also harbor feelings.

33387,"AITA for buying a product left near the self checkout?. Posting this on behalf of my sister, who was with me and is pissed about the whole situation. 

We were in line at the grocery store when I saw a lone container of detergent pods near the self checkout. This wasn't the appropriate section, so I assumed someone had decided against buying them. It was only seeing the container that reminded me that we are almost out of detergent. 

So we put it in our cart, ring it up and have just finished paying for everything. As I'm removing my credit card from the machine, a woman walks up to us and says that the pods are hers and that she had set them down while she ran back to grab something else. 

I gave her the container, and we showed an employee our receipt so that we could go grab a replacement since we already paid. 

The woman didn't say thank you or really seem satisfied that we gave her the detergent though, so I'm wondering how offensive it was that we took them in the first place? Is it against etiquette to buy items that are in the wrong section?

Edit: For what it's worth, the woman's reasoning was that she didn't want to make a second trip back through the store, as she had just done.. Am I the asshole?",NTA. Why didnt she just hang on to them when she went to grab something else? She shouldn't have been a twat about you picking it up. An employee could just as easily have picked it up to return it to the shelf where it belonged.,0,0,0,0,1
35138,"WIBTA if I tell my parents about my step-sisters juul?. Hey guys! Second AITA post here, hopefully y’all will be able to give me proper insight into this.

 To put it simply, my (F 16) older step-sister (F ~17) had a tendency of going through my room while I’m away and taking stuff that she likes/wants, while also pretending to not know what I’m talking about when I confront her for it. Well today, after she has taken much of my own art supplies that were gifted to me and that I bought for myself, I decided that I was going to go into her room and take back what was mine. Her room is a fucking disaster, might I add, so I *really* had to go looking for everything. After a bit of searching around I found a small container that made a weird sound when I shook it, and after opening it I found out that she had a juul (or like a weird looking e-cig) that she has no business owning. And the thing is, I’m not even surprised that she owns one, as I had once caught her with cigarettes that I never told anybody about because I was scared of getting yelled at by her for “snitching.” I really want to tell my parents, but I’m 1) afraid that it’ll cause a huge fight between the family, 2) have my sister talk shit about me at school, and 3) have my parents get mad at me for never telling them about the cigarettes before. I’m probably being irrational, as I don’t think my parents are the type to get mad at me for telling them about dangerous things my siblings are doing, but I’m scared that it’ll be my stepsister who takes her anger out on me. So... WIBTA if I told them about it?

TL;DR: Older stepsister has a secret juul I found while snooping through her room to get my stuff back, WIBTA if I told my parents about it?. Am I the asshole?","NTA Addiction to nicotine at such a young age is concerning. I hope that your parents will be able to help her quit.

31203,"AITA for not supporting my boyfriend’s new tattoo?. Last night, my boyfriend went to his friends party and got super drunk. Like his texts to me that night were “hebvgebjix.” Thankfully, he did text me that he was staying the night there so he wouldn’t be drunk driving. This morning, he texts me that he got a tattoo. I ask him “where did you get it done? Please tell me your friend didn’t do a shitty stick and poke on you.” He sends me a picture of this thing, and oh my god. It isn’t the blurriest, most crooked ass writing ever that says “say less” on his middle finger. I have included a drawing that I traced over the picture so you can see what we’re working with. He asks if I like it, and I tell him that I have nothing nice to say about it and I don’t want to talk about it. He pressed me more and I told him we still have time to scrub it off. The A doesn’t even have a center space for fucks sake.
     I don’t have a problem with tattoos. I love them, but neither of us have any. If he had actually gone to a real shop to get it done, I wouldn’t be mad. But now he has this blurry, ugly thing on his hand for the rest of his life. I’m so mad and shocked that he likes it, and now he’s kinda of put down that I don’t like it.

122,"AITA For making my boyfriend tell his boss to stop sexually harassing him?. My boyfriend went out last night with a bunch of coworkers because his boss is leaving soon. They all got really drunk, so I come to the bar to pick him up. He gets in and tells me that during the group picture, his boss slid his hand up his shirt and groped his chest/ass and rubbed his side. In the past, this has happened with his professor and he didn’t do anything about it. I told him either he texts his boss politely telling him to keep things professional, or I will email him asking for the same. 

Am I an asshole for giving him an ultimatum? I feel like shit, but I also feel disrespected that I’m at home while all this is going on and our relationship isn’t even being defended because he doesn’t want to cause a scene. But I told him there are ways to privately handle this without causing a scene. 

We are a gay couple, for context. . Am I the asshole?","This is a tough one. On one hand his boss needs to be held responsible for his actions. On the other hand, your bf might be feeling really violated and stressed about this whole thing and might not respond well to an ultimatum.

44292,"AITA if I go to lunch with my dad and brother, without my friend who’s staying with us?. I’m in college and due to fires near the school, we got evacuated. I drove home to spend the week with my family. I made plans with my brother and father to go to lunch. My friend from school texts me saying his plans on where he was staying fell through and asked if he could stay with me. I said of course and drove an hour to pick him up. On the way back I told him that I would be going to lunch with my family. He understood and was fine with staying home while I went.

The day of the lunch came and both my father and brother said that I was rude for not inviting my friend to our lunch. They said I shouldn’t come to lunch if I wasn’t going to invite my friend.

I understand where they are coming from and I know I’d appreciate it if my friend invited me to lunch with his family. But when I put myself in his shoes, I realized that if I were in his situation and I was staying there because I had nowhere else to go, I would understand that my friend had plans with out me that he made before he knew I was coming.

He’s said multiple times that he is fine with staying and would be totally content playing in my computer for the couple of hours I’d be gone. He would also have food available to him..

I smoke it outside and not close to her as her room is on the other side of the house.

I have said that I will not do that and if she wants her baby to be 100% safe she should find her own place.
I can only smoke outside and not do it around the baby but she wants me to stop completely.

This caused a massive fight and she now hates me.

48767,"AITA for taking a tip back?. I (19M) normally cut my own hair (I cut hair as a hobby) but I was feeling really lazy yesterday, so I decided that I'd just go get a haircut from a place close by.

When I went in, I was the only one in the room. The lady sat me down and sat back down on a chair and started watching TV.

She looked really antsy and nervous for whatever reason, and then she got up and said ""all right, I'm going to cut your hair""

I  tell her what I want, how short, I even showed her a picture as reference and she says ""I'll try my best"". Honestly, I should have realized that it wasn't going to be a good haircut after she said that, but it went over my head.

The whole time she was cutting, she was trembling and sweating the whole time. She totally disregarded what I asked for and it looked like absolute shit. When I say it was shit, I mean it was absolute dog shit. She basically gave me a mohawk and there were tufts of longer hair around my ears.

I didn't say anything, I just kinda stared in awe, I'm pretty sure she knew I wasn't happy with the cut because she said ""I didn't know what you were asking"" and ""sorry, it's my first time w/ a male client. This is my aunt's shop and she's been training me to cut hair""

I asked her where her aunt was and she told me that she went on an errand. I also asked her why she wouldn't tell me that it was her first time cutting a dude's hair, isn't that something you should mention before cutting someone's fucking hair.

I was really mad because the haircut was $25, which is way too much for a guys haircut if you ask me.

I handed her a 10 and a 20 and I waited for my change, but then I see her stick the remaining change into the tip jar.

I said ""really?"" and I took my change out of the jar and left.

I took my barber kit and just shaved off all my hair, while doing so, my gf and I talked ab the whole situation, and she said that she probably only makes money off tips since it's her aunt's store, and that I should have taken a hint that she was ""new"" to cutting hair because of how she was acting.

59438,"AITA for wanting my girlfriend to shower when she gets home. So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year, living together for a month. She showers everyday in the morning, but not when she gets home. She walks to and from work, it’s about 3 or 4 miles, and she gets sweaty doing it.

I don’t have a problem with sweat, and don’t think women aren’t allowed to by sweaty or something silly like that. The problem is she gets home, and basically immediately jumps into bed, covering the sheets in sweat. She leaves these yellow sweat marks in them. I’ve had to wash the sheets every day for a month.

I always shower when I get home because I sweat at work most of the time. So today I asked her if she could either shower when she gets home or avoid going into the bed until a few hours later. She got all upset and said that it made her feel gross and that she’s allowed to sweat and that it’s natural.

I don’t deny it’s natural.... but so is shit, and we don’t shit the bed.

8337,"AITA for questioning my ex for just ""not loving me anymore""?. I don't really know how to say this, but I have been through a lot of things involving evil women in my childhood and growing up. My first relationship went pretty badly, as this girl went from constantly thinking about me to flat out telling me that she just wants to be alone and that she doesn't love me anymore. 

I feel like this happened around the time when I was going through some problems due to my past, I was really questioning some things she was doing, and I told her that I am not gonna be guilt tripped for having feelings. This relationship has really messed up a lot for me over the past few years, I just want some insight into who messed this up. 

Right when I tried to stop sacrificing so much for her, she started noticing my flaws, and it feels like she is just gonna keep looking for perfection that she will never find.

She says she wants to be alone, am I a bad person for believing that she expected herself to be supported all the time, without having to do anything for me. I feel like she does not want to do anything to help me, she realized just how much things I have suffered, and I helped her out of such a dark place in her life. Now all of a sudden, I'm not good enough? I thought you were supposed to love people through the good and bad times, apparently she wants everything to be great 100% of the time.

34844,"AITA for lending money to my in-laws without telling my wife?. This has become a giant headache for me. First off, I should say that my wife and I have very different relationships with our respective parents. I am very close to mine, both emotionally and financially. She’s close with hers but also very “what's yours is yours and what’s mine is mine” when it comes to finances. Growing up my parents helped me out a lot - helped pay for college, bought me my first car, etc. etc. My wife’s parents did not help her financially after 18, but they also didn’t/don’t have a lot to go around.


Anyways, flash to the present - we are middle aged, well into our careers, money isn’t overly plentiful but it also isn’t tight. Last year my father-in-law a car accident where he ran into someone else (his fault). Not only has he incurred significant medical bills but also the amount he was liable for exceeded their insurance coverage.


Money has been very tight ever since for them. They do live in a massive (but not fancy) house and my wife is of the opinion that if they need the money, they should downsize. I didn’t really know the extent of things until last week, when my MIL rang me up and asked to borrow $1,500 because they couldn’t make their bills for the end of September. My wife was away on travel (although not so far I couldn’t have just easily called or texted). 


Here’s the potential asshole part - I didn’t think to ask my wife, I just went to the bank at lunch and drove the money over to my inlaws after work. 


I told my wife about it on the way back from the airport Monday morning and she and I have been fighting about it ever since.. Am I the asshole?","YTA. From the way you describe your financial situation, this is not an insubstantial amount of money for your family that you’ve lent without any discussion with your wife. 

It’s likely a sunken cost. You won’t be in a position to demand it back, really, without poisoning the relationship. Plus they might need even more cash in the coming months, and then what?

Your wife is probably a bit upset about all that but mostly upset you (1) made an important decision about your shared finances without consulting her and (2) got into a situation that puts you in the middle between her and her parents without talking to her about it. So, it probably feels like a breach of trust.

72664,"AITA for accidentally knocking over a mans coffee cup by using the ticket checker at the train station?. Okay so this happened about an hour ago, I printed out my tickets and went to get on my train. In order to the access the part of the station where the platforms are you have to insert your ticket into the bottom one of these ticket checkers and it shoots back out of the top and then the gates open. I tried to use the disabled/large carrying one as I was carrying a large bag of Christmas presents and I didn't work for some reason. I was a bit confused so tried to use the regular sized one to my right which was not in use. However the man on the next ticket checker was using my one as a coffee cup stand and I noticed this just a moment too late... my ticket shot up and his Starbucks went all over the floor splashing both our feet. As I watched this unfurl and in shock, I said ""oh shit!"" and looked up. Ready to apologise and assure the man that it was an accident, he turned to me and said ""oh what the fuck!! Look where your putting your ticket you dozy prick!"" He was livid. At this point I was even more shocked and wasn't sure if he was right? Should I have been more observant? But I was quick to get on my defense and replied a little sternly, ""excuse me? You should not have put your coffee on my ticket dispenser!"". He clenched his jaw and fist in anger and yelled ""fuck off you little prick!"" I was a little intimidated towards his aggression and didn't even think to offer buying him a new drink (which I may have considered had he not been so horrible) I quickly turned towards a nearby member of staff watching this whole ordeal to let me pass through the gates as my ticket was still not working! He continued to speak saying that I needed to get him a new one but I just continued through the gates to catch my train. Also the staff weren't much help in trying to talk him down or anything and were very slow to let my through the gates despite of the situation at hand.

I walked away convinced that I wasn't the asshole... but now I've had a moment to reflect, two thing come to mind. Should I have looked properly when using the ticket machine and should I have bought the man a replacement coffee?. Am I the asshole?",NTA.

She was being explicit and very direct about what she wanted. I was super hungry at that point and told her I want to wait til after i eat. She stayed on top and asked me a few more times to which I kept responding I want to wait. She finally rolled off and laid down beside me. She wasn’t upset or anything at this point. She just went back to talking normal with me. I asked if she was hungry and she said “you know what I want” still implying she wanted to have sex.

She says “no we shouldn’t” and pulls them back off. I assume she was trying to tease me in a similar way I was doing to her earlier. I try to pull them once or twice again and pull my pants down when she says “no” much more firmly this time. I realize she is being serious so I take my hands off of her and leave her be.

My aunt and her husband recently got married. She's very close to me age wise and we grew up very close. Recently her and her husband came back to our hometown from where they lived and worked together to have their marriage ceremony and all.

While they were here, they asked me if they could sleep at my house for a while. I have a one bedroom with my wife and said ""sure, if you're ok sleeping on the floor"".

3-4 days after the marriage, they suddenly decided to quit the old job, not go back to their rented apartment, the husband moved all their smaller stuff to our house, and they've been living in my living room for about 2 months now. 

I would have been fine with it, but my wife has to see her naked with her husband in our living room every morning, have their stuff all around, and eat our stuff for free. Which again, I'd be fine with, but she put a line in the Sand and basically said it's either them or her. So I asked them to leave as nicely as I could by the end of the week. 

They stopped talking to me as soon as I said that for the entire rest of the week, moved to a place they rented soon after, and they have been telling all my family how horrible my wife has been this whole time.

Some context: Me (31m) and my bf (29m) are in a LDR for almost a year now. It's hard as fuck, but we've somehow made it this far and he'll be moving here in a few months.

He's an artist. Last week he had been working super hard for a project he was going to present in a gallery during the weekend. I was helping with a video that needed to be presented together with the project because he just didn't have the time. I was very short of time myself during the week so it was 5 nights that I had little sleep and worked (after I came back from m my job)  pretty hard myself making changes until he was happy with it.  
Anyway, the day came. He didn't call me or text me during the whole day. I gave him a call a to some point cause I wanted to know how it was going, he said it was going well and didn't bother him more since I Imagined he was quite busy.  Night came. I didn't get any messages or call to tell me how the whole thing went.   
As I was going to bed pretty late that day, I sent him a text asking him if it was all finished or what was the story. He said it was over, he had been home for a few hours now  and was now getting ready to go out for drinks. 

That's it. No details on how it went, no thanks again for the help, no ""I'll tell you all about it tomorrow"".   
I was a bit hurt. I left him alone for the night and the next day because \*I know\* it's HIS day, but I kinda lashed out next night. He said he really didn't want to talk about the event, was tired and just wanted to go out and have fun, which is fair but I don't think a text message would had killed him.

78953,"AITA for refusing to see my grandmother?. Ok so, sorry for the long post and English mistakes. Basically, my father’s mother has always been awful. My dad told me stories about his childhood in which she was manipulative, a liar and always putting people against each other. To me she was never caring or loving. When I was little I developed a sense of “modesty” very early, so much that I started showering alone at 7 and didn’t want to be seen naked anymore, not even by my parents. My parents always respected that and thought me how to keep a good hygiene so that I could wash myself properly. There has been times when I was little in which she forced me to be washed by her when my parents weren’t around, despite me crying and refusing. 
When I hit puberty I was even more private and I found her waiting and looking at me behind the door when I was getting changed, but my dad always justified it with “she just wants to see her granddaughter growing up”. 
With time it got worse: my father has a sister with Down syndrome, so she lives with my grandmother and she takes care care of her. But growing old, my grandmother showed some signs of cognitive decay (and getting even more manipulative and a liar) so my dad, who is a doctor, went to a judge to get the legal custody of my aunt.
My grandmother later denounced my dad saying he didn’t do anything for my aunt and mistreated them, despite him going to their house everyday and doing EVERYTHING to provide for his sister. 
With all of this and several other stories about her, I decided not to be around. I don’t feel comfortable around her, I don’t like her, never did, and she has never been just a good person.

So now, my family says that I’m the asshole for not doing things like going to her house for her birthday or calling her occasionally. They say these are social norms that I have to mantain and that it costs me nothing.

Husband and I are divorcing.   We have a few kids and live in an area of the US with a notoriously high cost of living. He grew up here, and I've lived here for the entirety of our 10+ year marriage.  His parents (only family he speaks to)  are very close and watch the big kids after school and over the summer. My entire family lives about 3 hours away in a much more rural area. We visit at least quarterly. 

We have agreed to a 50/50 custody split. This means that my incoming child support is around $200 ‐ basically grocery money only. 

I've run the numbers. I can't afford to live here on my income (and child support)  alone.  We were on a tight budget while together,  and I basically have an $1100/ month deficit if I stay in the crummy apartment that I'm in AND pull the kids from private school and send them to the shady (2/10 on goodschools) public school. 

We talked about it,  and he's offered to pay more to keep us in the area,  but an extra $1100/ month is me squeaking by. No savings,  no hope of buying a home,  $50/ month entertainment budget for the kids and I, no extracurricular activities or summercamp... just, really tight all around. He hates where I grew up and doesn't want to move.  I mean,  it's not like I want to move either,  but damn.

There was a new all you can eat Japanese restaurant opening in our city and I decided to go with a friend on what I think was the 5th day of their opening week. 
Their formula was that you have a maximum of 10 rounds in which you order something (so not really all you can eat...) and it gets delivered to your table. 
I was a bit disappointed from the start but the options looked good so we placed the first round of orders and waited for that. 

It took half an hour for each of our single bite dishes to come. Granted, the restaurant was almost full, but the kitchen was open and we could see that there was plenty of staff working there, and we were just apologized to for the delay, so I'm not sure what caused it.

No biggie, food was pretty okay, ordered a second round. This time, it took almost 45 minutes for our orders to arrive. Remember, we were with just two, and we ordered a plate with 3 sushi on it and a portion of edamama (cooked soy beans with salt). 
At this point, I'm getting pretty hangry since I saved a lot of place for food and I'm getting impatient. Food is still good, we place a third order. 

No one comes at our table for over an hour. We talk with other people in the place who are also waiting for their orders, even drinks are coming in slow. There were 3 waiters walking around talking to people and we get an another apology but no explanation. 
Our orders were 2 bites of sushi each, and at this point I was fed up with waiting and told my friend if there's no food in 20 minutes, I'm walking out without paying. 

We ended up waiting 30 minutes at the insistence of my friend, but still no food. We left then, went somewhere else, finally had food. 

I've never walked out of a restaurant before, but I think I was justified at this point. Kitchen was still fully equipped, from my guess it was the order system that had something going wrong with it, but waiting three hours for our third round of small bites it just terrible service imo.

My oldest son got married to my daughter in law about 3 years ago and everything was going great. They were a happy couple and everybody on our side loves her and it seems like everybody on her side loves him so no problems there. 

About a year into the marriage she gets accepted into this university and my family (husband, 5 other kids, 3 daughter in laws and a couple grandkids) were super excited for her. Then they told us that the university was in Australia and that she was going to go while my son stayed here in America since he already had a good job and can occasionally send her money until she gets a job there. I was really worried for them since it's so far away, they wont get to see each other as often as they'd like with school and my son unable to just take days off whenever he'd want.

Wife has brought up the fact that I went through a similar midlife crisis recently and bought a new vehicle (expensive toy), and she was supportive through that.

73737,"AITA for blocking in a car on the electric charger that was finished charging?. TL;DR at the bottom. 

Ok, so I rolled up to the electric dc charger for my EV. These chargers take about 20 min to fill your car from  0% to 80% charge. All the chargers were being used. Except one where the car was at 100% but was not in their car and had clearly gone to dinner or shopping. 

So for some background it’s bad etiquette to use the fast chargers when your battery is above 80% one, because it’s the same speed as the slow chargers at that point and 2 because it’s quite a bit more expensive. 

 This is the ICE equivalent of blocking the only working gas pump and leaving your car there for 20 mins while you shop in the store. Not currently pumping gas. 

The car blocking the charger spot is the same model as my own. So I know this for a fact. 

So I park my car perpendicularly to them at the rear of their car (the only way I can reach the charger) and start charging. 

What do you know but they show up about ten mins later and expect me to move because I’m blocking them in. I tell them, “not my problem, you knew you were done charging and you didn’t care. People depend on these chargers to get home.” I never yell or do any cursing. Just matter of fact. 

His wife yells, he yells I ignore with my windows up. They finagled their way out of the spot via driving over the curb and leaving. Only to drive past 3 mins later and throw ketchup all over my car. 

So what do you think? AITA? 

TL;DR
I blocked in a car hindering access to the car charger. When the people return they expect me to move, I say kick rocks. They throw ketchup on my car.


EDIT: two things I failed to mention. 1: the charger tells you how long they’ve been connected total...it was approximately 1.5 hours like I said 0-80% takes 20 mins. The final 20% takes about an hour and it’s bad form to stay on these chargers past 80% because stage 2 chargers are cheaper and the same speed at that point. 

And 2: the charger works like this $1.75 to connect and $.28 per min. So disconnecting moving and reconnecting costs me an additional $1.75.

These two girls DO belong in the group of friends at my school, and one of them told me about a prank the men are trying to do, the prank basically Involves having the “attractive” one of the group text with this girl I know who is very kind but not very attractive, he is supposed to text with her, flirt with her, and ask her out on a date and then dont show up (but the girl will show up at the location ready for their date,but he won’t go) he then will block her on what’s app.

9267,"AITA for being annoyed that my in-laws only take my nephew to see “important” superhero movies?. Everyone in this situation is you’re basic white suburban folks.

 I’ve been a big comic book fan forever and have seen every comic book movie to date in the theater, usually on opening weekend. My wife and I (we’re child free by choice) have a nephew (he’s 11 now) who was into superheroes as a really little kid. Especially Iron Man. But he had never seen a modern superhero movie outside of the first two X-Men movies, so that means no DCEU, and no MCU. 

But his parents, my in-laws, *have* since taken him to see Wonder Woman and Black Panther. But like, only those two. 

Now, I’m a big whiny rainbow flag waving libtard. I’m right there with the rest of the “libtards” and bleeding hearts cheering on more diverse leads in these movies. But I also think that my nephew’s parents are teaching him that diversity is more important than if a movie is something you actually like by doing things this way.

Like I said, I champion diversity, but I don’t think you should go see something just because of the diversity. Go see something because you like it. My wife is a hardcore feminist, but she didn’t want to see Wonder Woman because she just finds the DCEU characters mostly boring. She found Suicide Squad a bit more interesting because it wasn’t the same old boring Batman or Superman bullshit she’s seen a hundred times. But when other women, including her sister in law heard she hadn’t seen WW, they made her feel like a “bad feminist”. Can’t someone just not want to see a movie because it doesn’t look good to them, while still cheering that it got made and did well?

The thing that really bothers me is that I think my nephew would really enjoy the other Marvel movies. And it’s not like they haven’t taken him or shown them to him because the movies are too white or too male dominated. Its traditionally been because he’s been too young for them in their opinions, which is fine. But now it’s fine I guess? Well my personally mission is to get the caught up by Infinity War..

Before it was a quick phone after school or before bed. Lately our 12yo has preferred Facetime and either used his mom's computer or my cellphone. He's been pushing for more independence ranging from asking us to drop him off further from and to school and wanting more privacy when he Facetimes me at his mom's. I bought him a cellphone as a balance.

55333,"AITA for calling my gf's friend a sexist over an argument about the Women's World Cup?. TLDR at the bottom

&#x200B;

**Background**: 

I'm a massive sports fan. I watch both male and female sports. However, I've 0 interest in soccer. I read the headlines and watch some of the goals, controversial incidents etc so I can make small talk with my friends, but I've only sat down and watched a full match only 3-4 times in my life because I find the sport unbearable to watch.

&#x200B;

**The Incident:**

I met with my gf in the city to get lunch. After lunch, we ran into 4 of her friends. There was a soccer game on in a bar in a few hours so they tried to convince us to go watch it. My gf wanted to go. I said she can go but I'm going to head back home because I have work to do and don't want to watch the game. Her friends tried to convince me to go but I stood firm in wanting to go home. 

One friend asked in a snarky tone -  ""is it because it's a woman's match and you'd watch it if men were playing?"". I completely disagreed with her. I hate soccer and wouldn't watch a men's game either. I also said it was pretty rude to assume that I wouldn't watch it since it's a woman's match. She pushed back pretty strongly. My gf tried to stand up for me but her friend wouldn't drop it. I got quite frustrated and said something along the lines of - ""it's ironic you're criticising me for not watching women's sport since I know for a fact that you have very little interest in sport (let alone soccer) and I have spent more time in front a screen/pitch-side watching women's sport in the last 6 months than you have in your lifetime"". I added that she was sexist for assuming that I don't support women's sport because I'm a man and that she wouldn't have criticised a female friend if they didn't want to watch this match. This caused her to get really angry and she started crying.

My gf and I went home and she called me a douche for making her friend cry. I explained the situation to my friends and the majority are on my side but the minority strongly believe that I was out of line calling her a sexist and should have just gone to watch the game. So, AITA?

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

I'm sports-mad but hate soccer. My gf's friends wanted us to go to a bar to watch a women's world cup game. I had work to do plus I hate soccer so I declined the offer. One friend strongly implied that I was sexist for not wanting to watch the game. I pushed back and ended up calling her a sexist which caused her to cry. AITA?. Am I the asshole?",NTA.

81805,"WIBTA if I didn't cancel my laser eye surgery after my mother asked me to?. I'll try to keep this short. So, about a year ago my mother started having some trouble with her leg. After going to many doctors we found out that she needed a hip replacement surgery. She had surgery in July but her prosthetic femur wasn't working for her. It popped out of its place 3 times in 4 months so we decided it was best for her to do another surgery and use a bigger, more stable prothesis. This new surgery is scheduled for February 20.

Now, I use glasses since I was 8 (I'm 28 now). My myopia has finally stabilized and I'll be able to do my eye surgery to correct it. It's scheduled for January 30, so 20 days before her surgery, and everything was fine. According to the doctor, it's a fairly simple procedure and recovery is fast.

Today my mom told me to cancel my surgery because hers needs full attention. I know her surgery is way bigger than mine and it's a long recovery period, and that's why I wanted to get mine done before hers. I won't be able to do it for at least 3 months and I've been really looking forward to it. My mother said I should think about her because my surgery will make her ""even more anxious than she already is"", and honestly, that's all I've been doing for a whole year. I put my life on hold to take care of her and I've been gladly doing so.

54618,"AITA for ""Sitting"" at Boston Logan Airport?. So, this happened one year ago, and nothing has made me question myself more than this one incident. I had a 6:30am flight from Boston to Dallas, TX. I get to Boston Logan at 4:30am. I have my boarding pass, all is good. However, the TSA checkpoint doesn't open until 5:00am, so I can't get to my gate.

I'm flying Southwest, and there is a TSA checkpoint been the Delta and Southwest check-in desks. None of the Delta desks are open and not an employee is in sight. On either side of the TSA check-in there are about a dozen chairs, each with a wheelchair printed on them. There's a sign saying, “please leave these seats for disabled travelers.” But there’s hardly a person in sight. Since there's about 20 empty seats, I sit down and wait for TSA to open. 

After 5 minutes a Delta employee approaches me and asks, ""Sir, can I get you a wheelchair?"" I looked at him, befuddled, and say, ""no?"" Then he says, ""this seating is for disabled customers only, you need to sit elsewhere,"" and walks away. I looked around and there was no other seating, and still no one around, so I didn't bother to get up. After about 10 more minutes, TSA was getting close to opening. There were a 3 people in line for the checkpoint to open. There were still no other people sitting in the 19 other disabled seats. A lady with a Delta uniform approached me and said, ""Sir, these seats are for disabled customers only."" I then replied, ""there are 20 seats, and I'm occupying one. And I don't see any disabled customers. The airport is empty. Who am I taking a seat from?"" The Delta lady then says, ""Sir, these seats are for disabled customers only."" I replied,""You just told me that. Who am I taking a seat from? Do you want me to stand next to this seat? What purpose would that serve?"" The Delta lady then says, ""Sir, do I have to call security?"" 

So, I literally just stand up, with my legs against the seat, and she walks away. After about 5 minutes I get in line for TSA, as it's just minutes from opening (approx 4:55am). The lady in front of me mutters something about wishing there were seats in line. I replied, ""well, there's seats right there (motioning to the seats about 5ft away), just don't try to sit in them."" The lady turns around, looks at me for a second, and says with complete seriousness, ""What kind of a-hole would sit in the disabled seating?"" 

Needless to say, I was speechless. I disregarded the Delta employees, but this is supposedly an impartial rando. So that begs the question, Am I the A-hole? Was this lady right? If even half of the seats had been occupied I wouldn't have taken one. But this zero tolerance crap was just hilariously ridiculous.. Am I the asshole?","lmao what?

 OK, so, 21st birthday. people always have high expectations for that, my friends included. Several of my friends wanted me to hang out and essentially, from what I understood, party for 24 hours. I told them all that I don't like to party on my birthday. For the last several years I've spent that day alone.

82340,"AITA for complaining about having the time allotted for my final halved?. This happened a year ago but it was brought up recently by a friend who was in the class with me. I knew my classmates thought I was an asshole about this but I didn't agree, but the fact that she brought it up after so long is making me second guess myself. 

I was taking a graduate level course in a clinical psychology program and the allotted time for our final was 2 hours. I have pretty severe ADD but I manage it okay. In the past I've gone through the trouble of getting formal accommodations, which usually includes special note taking, additional time with the professors, and most importantly, double time for tests. But I don't really like getting special treatment and for these courses I had been doing fine with the regular amount of time on tests, so I hadn't bothered going through the disability process.

Given the preparation and sample exams I knew 2 hours would be enough for me. But the day before the final, the professor just kind of offhandedly said that we shouldn't need 2 hours so he was just giving us 1. His reasoning was that then we could all get out of the semester a bit early, which everyone else in the class was excited about. 

I did panic a little bit and said right away that that isn't right, especially just telling us the day before. However I wasn't rude or demanding (at least I don't think I was), just anxious and sort of shocked. He was dismissive and just told me to deal with it. Later I went to his office to reiterate my position and remind him about my ADD issue (I'd already told him and the other teachers just in case it ever came up), and he just said that it was my fault for not getting the accommodations. I responded saying that I would have if I'd known this was a possibility, but 1 day wasn't enough time to get it set up. He got pretty irritated with me and just told me to suck it up, the real world doesn't always accommodate our needs.

In the end I did okay on the test but not as well at I could have since I was stressed and rushed. Am I the asshole here? I realize it is ultimately my fault for not getting the accommodation, but I thought it was unreasonable the way this happened, and I didn't think that asking him to abide by the scheduled time was a crazy request. It's especially shocking considering this was a clinical psych program and I would expect them to be more aware of the gravity of the problem.

My item was the beef, all others were his choice, but I quite enjpy them too. So we were about to order them all separately, and I sort of mentioned the combo deal, but it had the wrong items. When the waitress came I asked about it,--if we could change the items--and she said yes, so I ordered the same stuff thru that, even his items. I doubt he could hear me either or know what I was doing really. Therefore, I ordered for him, which he hates. I also got him skipped over and he couldn't order his Diet Coke. We got the same items plus wonton soup and saved 10 bones. He was really pissed though and ended up not talking to me much for the rest of the meal and being kinda cold I guess.

73820,"WIBTA if I stopped helping my sister out?. My sister is 25 and is married and has 2 children (aged 1 and 2). She has no job, she's taking a class at a local college and doesn't want to work, be a mom, and a student all at once, understandable. Her husband was working full time but his hours got cut 3 months ago and now he only get a maximum of 25 hours a week. He's not looking for a different full time job or another part time to supplement their income.

Last month my other siblings and I pooled money together to help her pay her rent because they can't afford to pay all of their bills anymore and the landlady threatened to evict them. This was no issue, everyone struggles sometimes and she would do the same for any of us if she could. She does need a lot more propping than the rest of us though, all of her furniture, clothes, and her car are hand-me-downs, she comes to my house for dinner 3 times a week usually because it helps relieve the financial strain of groceries, plus I get to see my niece and nephew and they're sweet kids. She eats with our brother sometimes twice a week.

My issue now is that she purposefully got pregnant again, when they can't afford the 2 kids that they have and pregnancy has proven to be very dangerous for her, last time they had to life-flight her to a trauma 1 hospital two days before the due date. We thought we would lose her and the baby, the first pregnancy was similar but not as extreme.

I'm so angry at her for being, how I see it, incredibly irresponsible. Everyone around her does so much to make sure that she's okay and that her kids are okay, and this feels like.. I don't even know, like she doesn't even appreciate anything and expects us to double down on our efforts for her because now she's going to have another kid.

I don't have children yet (and her struggles have made me think twice about ever having any) and I feel like I'm making my sister too comfortable in an effort to spare her kids the struggle. I know she'll need me now more than ever but I think I'm done. I can't keep supporting her if she's going to be so thoughtless, would that make me the asshole?. Am I the asshole?","NTA. It's not your job to support her, her husband should be looking for a full time job. 

I can see from your other comments they are actively trying for more kids which makes zero sense to me when they already rely on you and your brother to feed the ones they do have 5 nights a week.

64569,"AITA for censoring my girlfriend?. My girlfriend (19F) and I (20F) have been dating for just over a year and it’s been pretty amazing. We’ve only really had one fight, but it’s probably something we fight about every couple of weeks or more, and we haven’t been able to reach a conclusion.

I’ve been driving for about 3 years now, whereas my girlfriend got her licence about 3 months ago. Learning how to drive was not a good experience for me - my dad was constantly belittling me, telling me how much of a terrible driver I was, yelling at me etc. my whole family kinda likes bullying each other, and a big thing that everyone would make fun of me for was that I wasn’t a good driver. After driving for so long now, and also having to drive for work I like to think I’m a good driver, but it’s still quite a sore spot for me. When my girlfriend and I got together, I told her I’m fine with her picking fun at me, as long as it doesn’t have to do with my driving or my family.

Anyway, she still makes a lot of comments about my driving, mostly just things like ‘you know you can look at the gps if you don’t know where you’re going’ when I make a wrong turn, or telling me how to turn the wheel or when to stop when I reverse parallel park, even though I know what I’m doing. In a half an hour trip, she’ll usually make 5 or so comments like this. Usually I just brush them off, but when she makes more than that I usually tell her that I’m mad and to stop commenting on my driving. She’ll apologise, try not to do it the next time we drive, but will start up again soon after. 

After a year of this, I flat out told her that I don’t want her to comment on my driving anymore. Even if she’s trying to help, or it’s a compliment, just please don’t mention it (with the obvious caveat of if I’m speeding, or if we’re in danger etc). Her perspective is that she never means it maliciously, and that she’s only trying to help, which I understand. But she feels it’s unfair for me to censor her when she’s the one also in the car with me, so it’s not like it’s a solo activity, and I worry that by making this rule that I’m being an asshole because I shouldn’t be flat out refusing to let my girlfriend speak on certain topics.

For my and my twin sister’s 30th birthday, I made plans with her boyfriend to fly in and surprise her, since I live in a different country and we haven’t spent our birthday together in years. She will be THRILLED, knowing her. I told my parents when I booked the ticket, and they asked if they could come along too, and we could all spend our 30th together - great! I love my family, I don’t get to see them enough, and I was super happy we’d all get to be together. 

I did say I thought they should tell her they were coming, because I thought it would be more special for me to show up as a surprise, but they also wanted to be a part of the reveal. I said okay, and we could make that decision later.

It’s getting closer to the date, so my sister’s boyfriend and I have been making more specific plans. I called my parents to fill them in, and they dropped on me that my aunt wanted to come too...and that she’s already bought her plane ticket. At this point, it was starting to feel like it wasn’t my trip or my surprise anymore, like my parents have co-opted it, so I asked them to tell my sister that they and my aunt were coming, and my arrival would still be a surprise.

My mother is pushing back in the group planning message thread, saying she “has some concerns” about doing that, since sister’s boyfriend has already told her to take the Friday and Monday off work for something he’s planning, and that my sister is going to get suspicious. 

I sent them a message this morning to say that I was disappointed with how it was panning out. Firstly because my big gift was flying in as a surprise, and it feels less special if everyone is doing it, and secondly because it now feels like it’s her special surprise birthday weekend and everyone is making a big deal about surprising her for it ...but it’s also my birthday too!

He’s wonderful, and I couldn’t be happier for them, so I said yes, of course! But now it feels like everything else is going to overshadow my weekend with my sister.

30417,"AITA for wanting to break up my best friend’s relationship. My best friend and I are practically sisters. We have been through everything together for the past 12 years. Six years ago she started dating this guy. At the time we were freshman in college and he was a sophomore with dreams of becoming a doctor. 

Fast forward to now. He has never had a job because “if i’m going to be working for the rest of my life, why should i get a job now?” He’s flunked out of BA program twice. He received an AA from a community college after being kicked out of a university. My best friend has been working and received her BA within recent years and has been working a professional job for two years now. When asked about his progress of becoming a doctor, he responds defensively and aggressively, so most of us has stopped asking about school. 

My best friend mostly pays for everything in the relationship. I find her limiting herself in a lot of ways because she cannot afford to pay for the both of them, but she also doesnt want to do things without him because hes genuinely a good boyfriend to her. He gets money from his parents, conversely, she helps pay for her parents’ rent. 

He is always good to her, is by her side through the good and the bad, has never raised his voice to her or anything. Hes honestly a good guy, I just think hes a loser. 

Like, it was cute when we were freshman in college to date a guy that had no job and new aspirations. But we’re late 20’s now, shes been working her professional job and calls off often to be with him because he literally does nothing but play fortnite, but he’ll listen to her! And cuddle her when hes playing to stay a good boyfriend to her. He even taught her how to play so they could spend more quality time together. 

Together they’ve gained a lot of weight. My friend hasnt been moving up in the company because her work ethic is shoddy thanks to being fatally codependent with her loser boyfriend. She wants to go to grad school and I know she has the potential to do good things, but I think she’s “waiting” for him to make it, even if she doesn’t admit it.

45709,"WIBTA for locking my bedroom door while strangers view my apartment?. I moved into an apartment fairly recently and signed a one year lease. Obviously with a rental property, the landlord is allowed to call the shots on a lot of things. 

Recently, my landlord has been working with a viewing company to have someone give tours of my/my roommates apartment for next year. We (my roommate and I) have no control over when these times are, and a representative from the company has a key to let themselves/the prospective tenants into the apartment. 

Which brings us to the issue: my cat. I have a cat who is very skittish and will run when approached by unfamiliar strangers. She is also very curious, and will go out the front/back door if left open. The first time we had one of these viewings, I didn’t have work and was able to be there during the viewing and keep an eye on my cat to make sure she didn’t run out. This time, however, my landlord has scheduled a viewing during a time that neither I nor my roommate will be home (for 5 pm on a weekday).

I brought up the idea of locking my door for the day while I’m at work to some coworkers, who said it’d be quite rude since the prospective tenants wouldn’t be able to view the entire apartment. I made the viewing agency aware of the fact that there’s a cat in the apartment before the first showing, but I can’t guarantee that they let the agent showing it this time know/that that person will remember and not let my cat out by accident. 

I contacted the agency to see if they could move the showing but was told they only reschedule if there are extenuating circumstances.

She was going to renew her driving license but couldn’t cuz of the ticket. To be honest I don’t remember why she was driving my car. Apparently we switched cars because my tag/car license was expired and I needed to go to the capital. A police officer stopped her and fined her with $400.

We've lived together for over 6 years and she seems to have a real issue with cleaning up after herself in general, for example leaving food all over the kitchen when she's done cooking and used tissues all over the house. In particular though, I find it disgusting that she can go for a shit and leave it all over the toilet bowl then leave the bathroom without attempting to clean up. I wouldn't even do that in a public toilet, but when I ask her when she's going to clean it up, she becomes defensive, lists all the things she does around the house and says she was too busy to clean it. 

Is it unreasonable of me to expect that she should clean her own shit out of the toilet regardless of what else she does or how busy she has been?

We have no replacements and if he were gone, I would have to miss out on dancing for two performances. One of which is the night my parents and grandparents are attending.

8827,"WIBTA for not covering a shift I cannot work for a coworker in a dire situation?. Sorry for any formatting errors, this is my first time posting and I am on mobile. Short version at bottom.

I work at a sit-down casual grill as a cashier. One of my coworkers, also a cashier, asked me to cover her shift because somebody close to her died. The shift is 5-9:30.

However, I had asked for today off because I have a mandatory band concert from 6:30-9ish. My school’s band program is serious and I cannot stress how important it is to attend concerts. Students are given the dates of all concerts at the beginning of each year, and it you miss it, you get a zero (unless it’s an emergency).

I know I’ll get a zero if I miss it to cover for her. I’m not 100% sure how it would be integrated into my grade for this period. Best case scenario I go from a 100 to an 83 (B), but it’s just as likely to be a 67 (D). 

Overall I’d still be able to pull a 90 (A) in band for this semester (semester grade is the average of the grades from three periods and one final exam), so my GPA wouldn’t be affected. However, there is another problem missing the concert would cause - it would negatively affect the band. I am the only trumpet player on some of the trumpet parts for some of our songs, especially the more important ones. And the trumpet section is already too small for the composition of the band. 

My gut says don’t cover. Would I be the asshole if I don’t cover?

Alternatively, I guess there’s a chance I could cover for her just for an hour (5-6). But I do have a ton of homework I’d have to stay up late or wake up early to do. Would I be the asshole if I don’t suggest to do that for her?
_____________________________
TL;DR: Somebody close to my coworker died and she asked me to cover, but I have a mandatory and important band concert. Will I be the asshole for declining? And should I offer to cover for an hour of the shift I could work even if I have a larger homework load? 

Edited because a phrase was in the wrong spot. Am I the asshole?","No, you're absolutely not the asshole. You took the day off for a reason, and despite your coworker's unfortunate situation, you are under no obligation to cover for her.

He dated his high school ex-girlfriend for 3 years. When she was 16 she was pregnant with twins and miscarried at 6 months after an accident. This really traumatized them and their relationship was broken after, he left for college a year later and they broke up. 

Since then life has been very difficult for her (their mothers are family friends). She’s been through some bad shit including depression, drug addiction and yesterday she called him after years of no contact, to say that she is being kicked out of her apartment. She asked him for some help, namely enough rent for 2 months ($1000). He said that unfortunately he cannot help and that she’s essentially a stranger to him.

I berated him for his response and told him to have some empathy. Yes she may have problems but she’s a human who he used to have an intimate relationship with.

The players: Myself, Abraham, & Moses

Here's the backstory: I used to have a very tight friend group of 5 that included Abe and Mo. In the friend group, Abe is Mo's best friend and they are close but not sure if Abe would say Mo is his best friend in return.

Mo thinks of himself as an entrepreneur but he's mostly a dreamer. He's always 'one deal away from making it happen' and it never does.

Abe, on the other hand, is a successful attorney who is entirely self-made as he went to law school at night while he was working. Mo struggles for money and they get the bills paid mostly through his wife's steadier job.

About 6 years ago, Mo borrowed almost $25,000 from Abe so his wife could get IVF treatments so they could have a 2nd child. It worked and they have a happy 6 yo now. Because of Mo's constant dreaming and struggles with money, he has not paid a dime of this back. According to Abe, Mo has never offered anything, not even $100 here and there to try to pay it down. Abe can afford it and he seems unfazed by it.

OTOH, I was livid with Mo for not even making any attempt to repay and taking advantage of Abe's kindness, which is the only reason they have this child. I am no longer friends with Mo because of this even though I'm polite if I see him out somewhere (with Abe or not).

* Important Point #1: Abe, who is normally a realist and a real straight shooter, seems unconcerned and not mad about it himself
* Important Point #2: Abe said he'd get repaid somehow. He said it in a funny way to me, not meaning he would 'take a pound of flesh' or anything threatening but he believes he will get paid back one way or the other. I have my doubts

So AITA for being madder at Mo for his lack of repayment to Abe than Abe is himself?. Am I the asshole?","YTA

And then one time while they were shopping for dresses my aunt tried to get my grandmother to fork over hundreds of dollars and pay for all of the bridesmaids dresses. She basically did that thing where she ""forgot her wallet."" My mom tried to stop her and then she started yelling at her and threatening her. My mom decided after that to stop planning her wedding for her. My mom is still helping her a bit though, she used to own a flower shop and still has a lot of inventory so my aunt is getting a lot of stuff for free. 

since my mom stopped helping my aunt has pushed the date back multiple times. It's obvious she has no clue what shes doing and is in way over her head when it comes to budgeting (her fiance is unemployed, she works a minimum wage job). She keeps trying to get my mom to help again, and it's just been pissing me off to the point that I dont even want to go anymore. My mom always says you have to love and support your family unconditionally, but I disagree, I barely consider that woman a part of my family! She hinks I should go and support my aunt because shes family and I dont have to stay the whole time, but I would rather eat coagulated piss than see her to be honest. 

That's not even the only reason I hate her, shes a hypocrite, manipulative, abusive, neglectful, a thief and just a bad person over all. and her fiance, I dont know a ton about him, but whenever Im at their house he just smokes weed and plays video games all day while my aunt is cooking and cleaning and working. Hes an actual loser.
So WIBTA if I didnt show up? . Am I the asshole?","NTA 

BUT. If the main reasons you cannot stand your aunt are because of the way she treats your mom, and your mom is requesting that you go, please reconsider. It's possible that your mom would really like you there for moral support.",0,0,0,0,1
20183,"AITA for wanting more initiative and work from my wife?. Long story short: 
Wife and I have two special needs children, and I used to be in the military until I was separated due to not making rank twice. Our medical benefits and ABA homecare that was so critical to our two kids evaporated six month later and we lost all help regarding our children.

Life has slowly deteriorated and I'm off working as sole breadwinner over the last few years as she tries to take care of both kids and maintain a clean home, make meals, educate children, etc. 

I get kids ready for school before I leave, waking up before she does, then go to work at a demanding, soulless job all day, then coming home, getting kids handed off to me immediately as she escapes to her room the remainder of the day while I make dinner, clean kitchen, dining room, vacuum house, sweep/mop floors, take out trash, clean bathrooms, do laundry and more...DAILY. Because I come home to a trashy house and her excuse is she is too stressed out and she's doing all she can and yet, I'm the one doing everything morning and evening every day in a span of hours. It's just as exhausting to me and I don't get the nice evening break she does every evening - not to mention me taking the children out all weekend while she rests at home and 'rejuvenates.' I won't lie, I have said some choice words but it usually ends up in fights, so I've stopped saying things and just do these things without fuss.

Every time I see her, she's always on her phone or computer and gets angry when I ask her to help with the littlest thing. She claims she does so much, but perception is reality and I don't see the results she claims. Sex life non existent and getting counseling or help is impossible since we have crappy health insurance and can't afford such services to help our family.

AITA for wanting more out of my wife right now?

EDIT: Her family is no help since they are vindictive moochers who would rather sap us dry of any last financial reserves than care for our children and my family doesn't like her much and would rather claim they know best on how to raise our kids and undermine our authority, so we can't turn to family either and neither of us have any RL friends anymore to turn to..

I have a group of like 3 friends and a few others in school but i really only do stuff outside of school with the 3 friends

So anyways im really starting to dislike them but they are the only people i really have, its too late in school to make friends, i have some i talk to in school but none of them will ever want to be more than just an aquaintance type

So im kind of stuck with my 3 friends

Friend B is a huge asshole at times and will shit on everything i do and like and just act mean for the sake of it 

Friend C is very negative all the time and always shuts down anything i want to do with ""thats stupid"" or ""that sounds like a waste of time""

6296,"AITA for not taking my son when it wasn’t my time?. Background info: My ex tried to use me for money, I broke up with her but continued to be in my sons life, she tried to not allow me to do so, we went to court and I have my son every two weeks on the weekends. I am not a deadbeat dad, I pay for his daycare and clothes. I’m not complaining about doing these things but I just want to show y’all that I do take care of my son. I will add that my depression probably played a part in this 

To paint a better picture of my relationship with my son, I make us breakfast on the weekends, we go to the movies Saturday, and then Sunday we usually just build things or go play in the snow for awhile. Last week we went to the zoo three days in a row lol

Problem: I had an extra day off(normally I work 7 days a week) and wanted to spend it relaxing, I took this day off because i was burnt out from working morning and nights every single day. I posted something on my sc along the lines of “first day off in a couple of months, gonna enjoy this”. 30 minutes later my ex shows up, son in hand, convo goes like this 

Ex: “I want you to watch Neal”

Me: “is it an emergency?”

Ex: “No, ___ invited me to hang out” 

Me: “You can’t take him to daycare or take you with you?”

Ex: “I saw you were available so I decided to drop Neal off to you”

We argued for a bit and she ended up taking him to daycare. I pay for daycare for this reason, for her to have a safe place for him when she cannot watch him. I offered to have my mother watch him(I live with her because I’m saving for a house), she declined and wanted me specifically to watch him. I told her I couldn’t because my mind wasn’t right and I didn’t want to yell at him unnecessarily(terrible 2’s are a thing). Any other time I would’ve taken him in a heartbeat, but he shouldn’t have to be stuck with a grumpy dad. 

I’ve been getting hate messages from her family/friends about how much of a bad dad I am, I’m an asshole, don’t deserve my son, etc. 

Tell me reddit, AITA? 


TLDR: I was burnt out and grumpy from work so I took a day off, ex tried to get me to take my son outside of our schedule, I said no, and am now getting hate mail.

1742,"WIBTA if I make a Facebook post telling parents not to buy their kids live animals as presents?. Hello all, so with Christmas fast approaching I’m expecting the usual round of well meaning parents to buy their kids a pet as a Christmas gift. A little background on me, I’m an animal lover and I own several exotic pets. I wouldn’t call myself an expert but I have a decent amount of experience with the animals I own. 

Every Christmas I get always end up with people asking me advice on how to take care of various pets that they wanna get for their kids, and it pretty much always ends with them listening to half of what I say and then cheating out in important areas. Then in a months time I get asked if I wanna buy the pet that their kid has now lost interest in.

So here's my situation. My mother and I have never really seen eye to eye. We just have wildly different worldviews. Our rocky relationship hit its peak when I was 17 and came out as gay. She kicked me out and we didn't speak for three years. We reconnected about a year ago and, while I didn't move back in, our relationship is a bit more stable than it was previously. 

Throughout my teenage years, I would get pretty sick almost every time I ate and as a result, didn't eat a lot and was pretty underweight. Since leaving my mum's house, I've made several lifestyle changes and concluded that I'm probably lactose intolerant, as the sickness after eating went away after I cut out dairy. Thing is, Mum doesn't believe me. She thinks my boyfriend (who is vegan) is ""brainwashing"" me into thinking dairy is poison and accuses me of having an eating disorder. The comments I can brush off, but the issue comes with food she makes. She *always* manages to sneak dairy products into somehow, as if she's trying to ""catch me out"". The one time she witnessed me being sick after eating something she'd snuck quite a lot of milk into, she accused me of forcing myself to vomit. She did say she would stop doing it, but I know she hasn't because I *still* get sick every time I eat at her house. I've asked if I can just bring my own food and she said no, so I've just stopped eating at her house. 

My stepdad, my grandparents and my aunt have all text me to tell me how offended my mum is and how much of a difficult brat I'm being. I've tried explaining that dairy makes me sick and she keeps sneaking it into my food. I've essentially been told that if I want to have a relationship with my mother, I need to suck it up and stop being so selfish and think of her feelings. Are they right, or should I stick to my gut?

ETA: okay this got more response than I was expecting haha. Just wanted to clear up something I thought I'd added, but forgot to (sorry!) Mum has told my family that I have, essentially, an eating disorder (i.e. I'm making myself vomit after eating), and that I'm using allergies as an excuse. They aren't the type to really take mental health issues seriously, especially when it's a man having them, which is why I was told to ""suck it up"". Obviously telling someone to ""suck up"" a mental illness is no better than doing it with a physical one, but I just wanted to clear that up as I forgot to include it originally..

35750,"AITA for writing a letter to church?. So my girlfriend goes to a modern hipster church. It’s a very expensive building with no expense spared in the construction and decor. It has a cafe larger than most Starbucks. 

It has a large paid staff and numerous locations. It’s basically a corporation. They spend 20 minutes out of the hour long sermon asking for money, specifically $500,000 they need to start another church. 

I adjusted my work schedule on Sundays so I can attend, because I know how much it means to her. 

After the last service I was in the lobby waiting for her, and one of the pastors, who I admit, while in stage is very charismatic, was standing near me. 

I decided to introduce myself and he was the rudest, most uninterested person I’ve met in a long time. 

I was so irritated that I did something I’ve never done before. I fired off an email to the church (a different location, under an anonymous email) basically asking why there was so much expensive production, but very little content. Why they need so much overhead and so many paid staff members.

They seem to be asking for money to perpetuate their careers instead of using money to help the underprivileged.

49700,"AITA For taking too much time off work and pissing off my manager?. So I'm fully aware that I'm probably the asshole but need a second opinion. And I apologise about the length of this semi rant. 

Firstly, let me say that no I don't like my job and no one in their right mind would. I work in a warehouse for a supermarket packing groceries all day. 

For a little context, it's important also to know how management treat their staff there. Staff are split into people who are employed by the supermarket and agency workers, I fall into the latter as an agency worker. Now if anyone knows how agency works, shifts are never guaranteed and I've come to accept this. I work the 6-2 shift and they can cancel at any point before. 

Now here's where it gets frustrating, the managers demand that we give them at least 2 hours notice if we can't make it to work which is fair enough, it's reasonable, but this means if I'm I'll have to let them know before 4am and yes in the past I have been leaving my house at 5 and thrown up on my front garden and had to explain myself... which they were not happy about. However, they themselves have text me at half 5 before when I've been on my way to work and cancelled my shift, so they can do it but not me. 

So recently, I've been struggling with some health problems. I don't wanna go into details but let's just say some feminine issues and some bowel issues mixing is a bad time for all. For agency workers we simply have to text work and say I won't be in for my shift and that's that really. It's simple and easy and yes I have been taking advantage of that. In the past, if you take some days off and it's a few in a row or it's a week they sometimes call or text to ask what is wrong and if you've seen a doctor, basically they check in. 
So this morning I wake up and I'm still not feeling right, I planned to see a doctor if it went on for another couple days and I hadn't been asked by work if anything was wrong so it didn't occur to me to let them know there was an issue. I immediately got a text back saying that it's not funny anymore and that maybe I should come and resign (they will never fire me because it looks bad on them!!). 

Now this shocked me. I know I've been shitty with communication on my part but they've never ad a problem until now. I thought they could have gone about this a different way, in the past they've asked why I've cancelled shifts and not been rude, but this morning I got nothing.

29941,"WIBTA for not responding to unsolicited resumes?. TL;DR at bottom. 

I have a small law office. We only have 3 people (including me) on staff. Most days, we're all in and out of the office doing various things... court appearances, filing papers, and so on.

We're not hiring right now, so we have no active job ads posted anywhere. Even so, in the last few months, we've begun receiving a ton of unsolicited resumes for everything from summer internships to administrative positions. I have idea why. I've searched but haven't found anything online that would indicate we have open positions. We used to get a few of these every so often, and I would make the effort to reach out to the people (usually by e-mail) and thank them for their resume but let them know we're not hiring.

But, as I said, we've just received SO many in the last couple of months. At least 50 or more. Most are by e-mail, but some have been mailed. A few were hand delivered to our office. All these come directly to me. I honestly don't have the time to reach out to this many people and neither do the other people in my office. 

We've had quite a lot of incidents where people insist on following up, sometimes multiple times and usually within only a couple of days of having sent us their resume. A lot of their messages are along the lines of, ""If you don't feel like I'm a good fit for this position, I'd like to know why. What skills am I lacking that you think would make me a more attractive or viable candidate?"" A couple have tried to insist on personal interviews... apparently, I just don't realize what I'm missing but I'll figure it out as soon as I meet them?

So, in addition to the original resume, I may get 2 or 3 follow up messages from a single person. Multiply that by even half of the resumes we've gotten in just two months, and that's a heck of a lot of e-mails and phone messages that I have to slog through.

My inclination is to just ignore the resumes and delete or throw away any follow-up messages. WIBTA for doing so? Again, this is a law office, so it's not really feasible for me to put a message in an auto reply or anything.

Am I the asshole?,"YTA if you stay in the left lane when you're not passing anyone, and not preparing to turn left.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit of clarification here.  So the primary goal with driving (besides reaching your destination) is to keep the roads safe.  Generally-speaking, you can't control how other people drive, so you have to promote safety with your own driving.  This realization often leads to the mistaken conclusion of, ""If I go exactly the speed limit in the left lane, I can stop *others* from speeding, thus making the roads even safer than if I merely didn't speed myself.""

But that line of reasoning is flawed on many levels, the simplest of which is the fact that you won't stop someone from speeding if they want to speed;  you're just going to encourage them to pass you on your right (which is significantly more dangerous that being passed on your left), *and* to potentially do so more aggressively than they might have otherwise, since they're reacting to what they perceive as your attempt to force them to ""obey"" you.

If you're concerned your doing so will get back to your SIL and cause family drama, maybe there's a coworker who would be willing to lodge the complaint.

55822,"AITA for showing up to work in tennis shoes on “Casual Friday”?. Hi all,

So at my job, we (the males) have to wear dress pants and a button-down (tie and jacket isn’t required but some wear those too) and dress shoes. But on Fridays, we have “Casual Friday”. What my boss actually means by Casual Friday is dress pants, a short-sleeve polo shirt, and dress shoes. So I show up to work on Friday in dress pants, a short-sleeve polo shirt, and Nike shoes, since its Casual Friday.

My boss later called me into his office (not in front of everyone thank goodness) when he saw my outfit. He told me I wasn’t following the Casual Friday rules, and I told him, “Do shoes really matter? Really? They’re just Nike shoes, it’s not that big of a deal. Besides, I still have on the required dress pants and polo shirt, so I don’t see what the big deal is”. He says if I don’t wear dress shoes next casual friday, he will take action.

AITA for showing up to work in tennis shoes instead of dress shoes on “Casual Friday”?

EDIT: Forgot to put this in the post, but my boss only told certain people about “Casual Friday”. I was not one of the people told by him, but a coworker told me. The coworker (we’ll call him B) didn’t tell me about the shoe policy.

EDIT 2: I think I’m going to ask my boss if we could maybe have a summer dress code (dress pants, short-sleeve polo, and dress shoes). Am I the asshole?","YTA if you know the dress code, flout it, and then instead of accepting the rules, try to discredit the idea of the dress code.

38359,"AITA for pretending not to recognize someone?. I was at the store with my fiance and I saw this kid I had gone to high school with. We weren't friends during school. Anyway, fiance and I had been out on a boat all day, we were hot and tired, hungry and trying to get something quick for dinner.

The kid from school spots me and comes over, asks me if I'm CarmelaCorleone, I say yes, he asks if I remember him, we were in school together. I told him I'm sorry but it's been a long time since high school and I didnt keep up with anyone and no, I dont recall him.

He started going on about the classes we took together and how i once let him copy a couple of my test answers, and how he dated this girl who knew one of my friends.

Now, both me and my guy dont really feel like having a long, reminisce so my fiance goes off to grab the frozen pizza and leaves me with HS Guy. I just wanted to get out of there and go home so u told him ""I'll go through the yearbook later and try to remember. Hope you ha e a good night."" Went and found fiance and we checked out, went home.

Just a little while ago I got a message from my old best friend from school, who i haven't spoken to in about four years, wanting to know why HS guy messaged her about me being rude to him. I told her I really just didnt remember him and I wasnt trying to be rude, just didnt remember."" Anyway, shes insisting I'm lying and was deliberately being an asshole.

Here's the thing, I really dont remember him all that well. We ran in different groups and they only overlapped briefly when he dated a girl I was sort of friends with but we weren't close friends. And I let plenty of people copy my tests in school because I was desperate for approval from my classmates.

This guy and I had about as minuscule a connection as possible, we never spoke outside of school nor after graduation. We dont even have mutual FB friends.

I didn't used to have an issue with this, but now I feel like I'm still being babysat although I'm already a teenager. I don't really know how dad's friend feels about it, he doesn't complain and we get along fine, but we don't have much to talk about since he's my dad's age.

I was told I would get paid, but they (my mom and sister) never specified how much. She moved back home after this because she can't drive herself anywhere, so I started driving her and after about a week I decided to ask for a certain amount. It's about an hour drive round trip 2 times a day. That's 10 hours a week. I asked for 50 a week, or 200 a month. She makes enough that this is perfectly reasonable. I am asking for 5 dollars an hour, with super awkward hours.

  She works 4pm-12:30am. The earliest I can go to bed is 1 am when doing this. I also have to be free before hand because sometimes she wants to go to the gas station on the way to get cigarettes. I can't always take her because I try to hang out with friends or I may have plans so I have to let someone know before hand so they can get her there. They're using this against me and saying that I'm asking too much because I can't be there every single time, ignoring that fact that if for some reason nobody else can take her, I still have to be free to do it, even if it means cancelling plans.

It's stressing me out that I have to do this still considering they refuse to agree to a set amount, so I have no clue what I'll receive if I receive anything.

My coworker Evan and I have become pretty good friends since I started working there. We’re both guys in our twenties. 

This last weekend I was just hanging out at home with my girlfriend watching movies. It was Saturday night around 2am when I get a call from Evan. Thinking that something happened, I pick up. 

He’s sobbing on the phone and it takes me a couple minutes to calm him down. Eventually he blurts out that he’s in love with me and wishes that I would feel the same about him.

Context: My (f18) boyfriend (m19) and I have been dating nearly two years. We attended the same highschool together for six years. Last year, I attended most of his graduation dates. I stayed at his rehearsal for graduation, attended the senior chapel, and his graduation. 

We have never had any major problems in our relationship except his inability to schedule or be on time. A recent example is our senior prom. 

For his senior prom, I showed up to his house three hours before when we needed to arrive. I asked him to be ready to leave for class pictures when I got there. I arrive and he is showering. We miss class pictures, and nearly miss our reservation required dinner as well. I let it slide because it was his prom and he had freedom to do whatever.

For my senior prom, I let him know the date months in advance so he could ask off work so we could do pictures and have a rolling schedule because that's what works best for us. He didn't ask off for work because he forgot about prom. He let's me know a week before so I have to reschedule our pictures and not attend our class dinner. I really wanted to attended the dinner because I have a class of 17 students and we are very close.

Cut to today. Last night he let me know that he forgot to let his dad know my graduation dates so they wouldn't plan a trip overseas during that time. So he is missing my senior chapel, senior breakfast, graduation, and graduation party. I let him know how upset I was and that I was mad at him. He asked me to ""give him some slack ... it was a human mistake.""

Despite this, one of his flaws is that whenever he has a fact or answers a question, he gets REALLY upset if I look something up as a fact-check or to further explore the topic.  This could be about anything from politics to physics or whatever.  He always accusers me of not trusting him, or that I don’t “believe him.”  

The latter was often true, and yes often the things he said were wrong, but I usually let it go because it wasn’t a big deal and he was feeling insecure about his intelligence (which is NOT low), and it doesn’t usually sit with me or anything.  

That changed recently when he got me some replacement vape pods for some that I had lent him a while back.  He mentioned how he got them in a manner that was potentially not legitimate and that he knew “they were fine and that the reviews were all great.”  He told me to trust him and that they were safe.  

With people dying because of additives in vape pods, I asked him how he could possibly know that.  He got really mad and told me I should just trust him.  

The thing is, he has NO way of knowing what additives they have, they were not bought with legitimate brand verification.   He clearly knew that he didn’t know and was just telling me that to not admit he’d done no research.  He continued to get super angry when I found the brand and told him that they had been reported as dangerous. 

I told him it wasn’t okay to get mad at someone who wanted to do their own research, and that it wasn’t a personal attack on him.  I told him that it makes me feel like he doesn’t care about my autonomy when he expects me to listen to him blindly.  I told him it hurts that he would risk my safety or my educated decision for his ego.  He won’t talk to me, and is still upset that I had to go and look it up like “I don’t trust him.”

A few months ago she told me about one of her next tattoo ideas. It's a ski track. Like when someone skiied down the mountain and you see where he went through. Just that, without a person or something else on it. And when she told me this I immediately loved it and had a picture where I would put it on my body (but with a snowboard track). I didn't tell her at that moment but confessed a few weeks later. She said that I shouldn't do it because it was her own idea and she wouldn't like it me having the same one.

I understand her point cause sometimes I'm like that, too. But I always told myself that I will make a tattoo when I get an idea and think IT HAS TO BE THIS! Otherwise I won't. And I absolutely love the idea! I already played with the thought of tattooing something about snowboarding cause snowboarding and everything about and around it is the thing I care about and love the most in my life.

48382,"WIBTA if I didn't tip the pet sitter after tipping last time?. My boyfriend and I just got a cat about 3 months ago after our old cat passed away in May.

Our old cat used to not mind car rides and going to visit our parents, so we would bring him with if we took a trip longer than a weekend. If we were only gone for a weekend, he could be left alone with someone checking on him once. 

Our new cat is very different. He doesn't love the car, and regardless, since he is new to our family we don't want to drive him back and forth until he is super comfortable with us and his space here. He is also on only wet food for health reasons so he needs to be fed twice a day. All of that aside, he is an energetic, young cat and needs stimulation and attention a lot.

We took a short trip about 2 months ago and hired a pet sitter from a local agency. We were only gone for a weekend so the sitter only had to come 4 times (30 minute visits)

The agency was super professional. They had two sitters come and visit beforehand to get all of the instructions and they left notes on the counter for when we got back. Not only did the sitter feed him and scoop the box, she played with him, pet him, and made sure the apartment was okay. 

Those four visits totaled about 96 dollars. I ended up leaving the sitter about a tip..I don't remember how much extra I left but I think it was between 10 and 20 dollars. I did that partially because I didn't have change, but partially because I didn't fully understand how the agency worked. They had never said anything about tips/where they go. I had always tipped pet sitters in the past, but they were independent--not with an agency. 

Now, next week we are going out of town for Thanksgiving. We are leaving Tuesday morning and coming back Saturday evening, so it is a bit of a longer trip than last time. We hired a pet sitter through the same agency again, it will be the same sitter coming to care for our cat. 

Since it is during the week of thanksgiving, they charge $2 extra per visit, and $5 extra per visit on Thanksgiving. All of the visits are coming out to $204 total.

They told me the surcharges go directly into the pocket of the sitter, since they are taking the time to come out on their Holiday--which I totally get and agree with. 

That being said, $204 is a lot of money. WIBTA if I didn't tip on top of that---since it includes the surcharges? I'm getting charged $20 in mandatory surcharges which will go into the sitters pocket. WIBTA if I didn't include extra on top of what I'm getting charged--since I tipped on my own accord last time?.

47260,"AITA for saying that my cousin was adopted?. I havent seen my aunt in 3 months and when we had a family gathering she showed up with a baby! All right cool I get a new cousin! The baby looks about a year old but she keeps treating him like a newborn. Sometime later she keeps talking about how it was hard to give birth to him and I'm like what? Didn't you adopt him? She said that he only looks big and that I havent seen her for a couple months. Yes, I havent but I think I would have remembered her being pregnant, it's hard to miss those kinds of things! 

Later on I sort of got pissed at her because shes refusing to acknowledge that she adopted him (a couple of the cousins asked as well) and I didnt understand the shame in admitting that your kid was adopted. I'm not saying it to the kids face that he's adopted and I understand wanting to wait, but why is it such a terrible thing to admit? She refused to admit and just kept on saying that she gave birth to him. And it was also the fact that she kept saying she gave birth to him that was strange. She didnt really say that he was her son, only that she gave birth to him. 

I brought this up to her and it immediately started a fight. I was chastised by her, my parents and grandparents for bringing it up, but my uncles and cousins are sort of on my side. We're sort of looking at it like ""it is what it is and theres not shame in adoption"" while the other side is pissed that I even brought it up, that it wasnt the time to talk about such things.

67851,"AITA for getting mad at a parent after their child came running toward my dog. Not a long story but there’s an outdoor outlet mall near my house and I usually bring my dog there during the summer. Dogs are allowed at the mall if they’re on a leash and don’t go inside the store.

He’s very anxious and I’m trying to acclimate him around people. I thought this was a good way since he’s on the leash near me and there’s usually a ton of people walking around. 

Usually I’ll sit on the bench and let him sit on the ground and just let him chill out and watch people go by.  People do go up to me and ask if they can pet him and I say that he’s anxious so he’ll probably bark at them. Most people understand this and they will either walk away or crouch down and let him sniff their hand. 

Today was particularly busy since it’s back to school season. I see a parent and her child is running around bumping into people and the mom is just on her phone not caring and letting her kid (probably around 6/7) run around crazy. Anyway this kid comes charging at my dog and it surprises him and repeatedly barks at the kid. The kid gets scared, falls over and starts to cry. 

The mom finally pays attention to her kid and realized he was crying. She says “Control your stupid dog, look what it did to my kid” and she is just yelling at me calling me irresponsible and stupid. And then she says “You need to train effing your dog” and she’s just keeps getting mad, yelling and cursing at me while her kid is throwing a fit. 

At this point I’m fuming and I finally get a word in and say “You should really pay attention to your kid instead of your phone, this wouldn’t have happened if you actually paid attention and didn’t let him run around like crazy “ This made her even mad and said “I can let my kid do what ever I want I’m his mother” to that I said “Well he’s my dog and he was sitting here calmly until your son spooked him, you should really teach your kids some manners.” Anyway at this point she’s calling me names and yelling at me so I said fuck you have a nice day and walked away. 

My mom saw the whole thing and told me I should’ve just apologized to her. But honestly I don’t think I was in the wrong since my dog and I were just minding our own business.

79877,"WIBTA If I got a gas station employee fired for stealing my credit card information?. There’s a bit more nuance to it than the title let’s on, just want to bounce this off of a few strangers before I do anything.

So, today I was driving home from visiting my girlfriend, about 4 hrs away (damn med school) in Philly. About an hour into my drive somewhere in New Jersey, I see my gas light pop on. I pull into the next rest stop that comes up a few miles down the turnpike, and pull into the Sunoco this rest stop had.

As I was in New Jersey at the time, all of the gas pumps were full service. Can’t pump your own gas in NJ. I used to know why it’s like that... long hath forgotten. Anyways, I roll down my window and let the attendee know to fill it up with regular, and hand him my card. I settle back into my podcast as I wait.

After he starts pumping the gas, he comes back and says “Excuse me, what’s the zip code necessary for the card?”  Plenty of gas pumps I’ve used in the past require a zip for fraud protection (how ironic), so I gave it to him without much thought. 

I get home a bit later, start to unwind, and get a text from my credit card company, asking if I made a purchase for $66 at a Dominos. In New Jersey.

My mind immediately went to the gas pump attendee, as I had not used that card for another purchase that day whatsoever. At this point I didn’t want to jump to any conclusions, so after freezing my card and having a new one sent out, I called the Sunoco at the rest stop and asked to speak to a manager. I ended up speaking with the second shift manager, and asked if employees needed a zip code to be able to charge cr

After the call, I got to thinking if I really should file that complaint or not. On one hand, it’s possible that this pump attendee does this all the time to people coming through their gas station, as plenty of them are from out of state and probably also wouldn’t think twice about giving a zip code like I did. On the OTHER hand, the dude is a gas pump attendee, and more likely than not is struggling financially. 

What does everyone think, WIBTA?

EDIT: Alright so after reading some replies it’s kind of a “no shit dude” that I should report. 

I just want to clarify that the reason I even felt bad whatsoever was because my credit card company INSTANTLY flagged the charge, and after sending me a confirmation text, declined it.

I went out to a brunch with some friends. I'm a vegetarian, and this one dish called The Penne looked amazing. I pointed to the specific entree on the menu when ordering. The food came and I had a few bites. It tasted off, but it was penne pasta with the correct looking description My friend tasted it and told me it was beef. I told the waiter and he was extremely apologetic, but hey, mistakes happen, I wasn't mad or blaming. He explained that there are two ""The Penne"" dishes, but no one ever orders the veg so he wasn't thinking during the brunch rush, and I didn't notice because I always read the description first to skip over anything with meat. He brings me the correct dish and it's delicious. Here's the part where we might be assholes. He goes to take away the mistake dish, but it's complete full still as I've only had 3-4 bites. My friend asks if it's possible for him to take it in a to-go container, as he hates wasting food and assumed it would get tossed in the kitchen. The waiter seemed weirded out, but agreed. The check comes and I'm charged for both dishes. I certainly didn't expect to have my dish comped for the mistake, but I was surprised to see we were charged for both. AITA for being upset at having to pay for both meals? I didn't say anything, but I was fairly turned off by the experience.

Why I/we might be TA: We asked to take the food home, so it makes sense we'd have to pay

Why I/we might not be TA: 1. They put two dishes with the same name on the menu and the waiter didn't clarify. 2. We politely asked if it was possible, so I feel the waiter should have told us it would be charged the mistake dish, especially because I've never had to pay when a dish has been messed up before, and am usually given the dish to give away since otherwise it becomes waste.

So reddit, should I have accepted the cost of the extra dish (to clarify, my friend who took it home insisted on paying for it for me)? Or should I have spoken up and stood up for myself? It was \~15 bucks, so not nothing, but not enough to make a big deal about when having a good time with friends. Thanks

My mom is still upset about this and since I moved away to college she hasn't really had any way to let me know about it except for every year when it comes time to do the FASFA.

Every year she drags her feet because the only way I can pay for school is with financial aid, and the only way to do that is for her to do her taxes so each year she does them later and later.  Now I'm a junior and its my last year filling it out so she didn't want to do them at all then waited until December to fill out her tax information. Well they got sent back and she plans on redoing them but when she told me this she once again reminded me about the cards I didn't send and how she finds it unfair that she has to do something for me and I don't have to do anything for her.

5536,"AITA for being indignant about the fact that husband is seemingly unconcerned about my feelings?. Hi everyone! Long time lurker, first time posting. 

My husband and I (38M, 31F) have a seemingly perfect relationship outside of typical work/children stressors. We've been together and married for approximately 4.5 years after waiting only a few months to get married. We communicate often, and well.  We trust each other, completely. Any time an ex might slide into DM's for any reason, it's brought forward. 

I admittedly read A LOT of r/relationship_advice. Idk why, really. Call it a guilty pleasure. I get tired of the typical mundane droll that is FB, IG, etc, so I often turn to Reddit for something more stimulating.

To get to the point, I started to see a pattern in the last several days on RA where the OP's cite that their significant other was cheating after several years (lets say 6+) of supposed monogamy, and they claimed to have not known their were any issues in their relationship that would have caused the SO to act out in that way. 

This, in turn, prompted me to shoot my hubs a text to ""check the oil"" on our marriage, as it were. We had a baby a few months ago, (my first, his third- we have custody of his other two) and we've been adjusting to the changes, of course. I asked him if there was anything he needed, or was lacking from me, whether it be doing more around the house, doing more things with him, or yes, even physical aspects of our relationship. This lead to him saying no, he's good (to paraphrase) and then make jokes about more sexual acts, of which I will spare you.

Okay, cool. 

I pick up the baby from my mom's, and am on the way home when I realize that, heyyyy, he never asked me if I was good. He answered my question with ""nope, we're good, more sex."" And went about his way. So I point this out, and he replies with ""oh, so we're fighting today. LoL jk jk.""

Neither of us are good at texting or calling first. He lives far away, in another state actually, and comes to my area for his work (general contractor). So we talk on the phone maybe once every couple weeks and see each other maybe once or twice every few months.

My dad's birthday is in a couple of weeks, and I told him I'd treat him to a beach visit and steakhouse dinner when he was next in town. I had one request, though, that he for once leave Henry at home with his mom. I like Henry, but he's an 8 yr old as well as autistic and can be very disruptive and demanding. i.e. Sometimes when me and my dad are talking he'll start screaming until we stop because we aren't paying attention to him. I thought it would be nice to, for once, have a little father-son time just me and my dad, so we could talk and catch up and hang out since I haven't seen him in a few months and I miss him. 

My dad didn't like that at all. He asked if I didn't like Henry (I haven't spent a whole lot of time with him, relatively) and I said no, I love him like he's my brother because he is, but he's also a loud little kid which makes it hard for my dad and me to talk one-on-one.

37399,"AITA for snapping at a family member for asking me why I’m still single?. For some context, I’m 24F + Asian and never had a boyfriend in the years I’ve been alive. I’m socially awkward, insecure despite being average looking(not ugly but I wouldn’t call myself pretty. Just average.) and just reclusive/quiet when not spoken to. The incredibly shy/introverted and slightly studious type. Henceforth my singleness. I have been asked out many times by boys but they never really interested me? They weren’t my type honestly and I definitely don’t want to lead then on.  I’ve always been pretty straightforward about that. I figured when the time comes, it will come. Sure I would like a relationship but I’m not actively looking. 

With all that being said, I can communicate like a normal human being despite hating human interaction. I’m a recently licensed pharmacist who’s worked the beast that is retail for a while since undergrad. I’m a professional in my field, very personable with my patients and coworkers. That’s all fine. 

I have a cousin(34F) who my mother adores. My cousins husband brought her over years ago from her home country through marriage and they are doing pretty well for themselves with a little child. She depends on her husband and expects him to do all sorts of things to accommodate her preferred living style. New Lexus and home and all that jazz. She works too to support her family so I don’t pry into whatever they do cause its not my business. 

Now this cousin is always asking me “when will you get a boyfriend.”, “your younger sister has a boyfriend already. She surpassed you!”,  and all these snide comments about my love life. Which doesn’t exactly make me happy cause it’s none of their business. This cousin also prefers my sister(who I admit is the fun one in her eyes. while I’m the smart one. Its just the way I see our dynamic and quite frankly I’m okay with it). 

My other family members also bring this up sometimes too. It gets really annoying real quick. I hate it. But I’ve learned to ignore these snide comments and to tune them out. Just remain quiet whenever they bring it up cause there is no use addressing it and I’m a pretty non confrontational person. 

But today I’ve finally had enough and replied “ I make 6 figures a year. I don’t need a man to take care of me or make me happy. I can do it myself. Please stay out of my business” to her being single comment to shut her up. it got incredibly awkward real fast.

We've known each other for a long time, close to 5 years as extremely close friends and we attempted a LDR that lasted just under a year toward the end of our time together. The LDR eventually fell off after realizing the unrealistic expectations we had for our relationship, and after not taking any action to make these expectations come to life. We wanted, of course, to still remain friends but I couldn't out of fear I'll watch them grow and be happy with someone else. I calmly explained my position and how I felt and thought it'd be best to remove eachother off all platforms, no blocks or reports, just a voluntary separation that will hopefully transition into nothing and we'll go about our lives. They did not like this idea and thought it was unfair to them for me to decide how our friendship should be handled. Per their request I gave a normal friendship the best effort I could for a few weeks.
It was shortly after I told them I still think it's best we moved on and removed them. This wasn't fueled by anger or jealousy, not that I'm aware of anyway.

39261,"AITA For Telling my ex's new girlfriend thay he forgot to break up with me before getting into a relationship with her?. This one is a doozy, I'll tell you that much. Me and my now ex JUST broke up, because he posted that he was in a relationship with another girl. Apparently, this has been going on for 6 months and he's been acting like everything was fine for that amount of time, we had occasional conversations about how life was because we both work long shifts; he works nightshift and I work dayshift so we don't get to see each other often, he kept telling me how much he loved me, we talk about our hardships and how life sometimes sucks etc etc. 

So I confronted him about it and he deflected the whole situation and made it about his problems at home. Like, I understand he had a terrible home life, he talked to me about it so many times. I supported him through every part of it, but he tried using that to gain sympathy from me all the while claiming she was there for him during that tough time, as if I never been there for him, missing sleep so I can talk to him and try helping him through the tough times. He basically acted as if I was never there for him when he needed me and hadn't been decieving me for months. 

So I decided to be an absolute petty mess. I had a strong feeling this girl didn't know he had been my boyfriend for almost 3 years so I went on to the relationship announcement and congratulated them. I also put in there that he has been dating me all this time while seeing her and that maybe next time he should officially break up with his significant other before making a relationship public. So I need to know, is my anger clouding my judgement  because I potentially ruined their relationship or am I justified for what I did? Was I being an r/nicegirl in that situation and should have let it go?

44893,"WIBTA if I asked my roommate to use headphones when he listens to Christian music?. I’m working my first internship post college graduation, and I’m living in company housing. The housing is nice if a little small, and I live with four other company interns. 


One of the interns has often described himself as “devoutly religious” and likes to talk about Jesus and Christianity often. I understand that we all have the right to practice religion as we please, but I have a complicated relationship with Christianity due to some family trauma. My family was very religious when I was growing up, and when I came out as gay in high school, there was a very rocky period of my life where the church and everything that my life was based on as a kid was thrown back in my face. I’m very wary of Christianity and evangelicals in general now, but I haven’t really said anything to him about my relationship with religion beyond stating that I’m not religious. 


This morning, I was sitting in our living room drinking coffee with one of my roommates when the religious roommate got up to take a shower and get ready for church. He closed the door to the bathroom and basically immediately I heard contemporary Christian music blaring from a speaker in the bathroom. Specifically, the songs that he was playing are ones that I often sung in church growing up. I found myself very much on edge listening to this music, and it brought up some intense feelings of anxiety and rejection. 


I understand that we’re all in close quarters, but I’m considering asking him to use headphones if he wants to listen to music like that in the future. It seems like a small thing, but it puts me back in a period of my life that contains a lot of trauma that I haven’t totally worked through. I’m worried that he will feel like I’m attacking his religious beliefs or will spin it into me being hostile toward Christians, or worse, use it as an opportunity to try to convert me. So WIBTA?.

62898,"AITA for sticking to my daughter’s grounding?. My daughter (11) has a bad habit of going straight to watching TV when she gets home and not wanting to do much else unless a friend calls. I admit we are to blame for this. Our eldest wasn’t at all addicted to the screen and didn’t need specific times. It made it harder when we had our daughter and she obviously was. We’ve tried to help her get better at it, but it’s lead to fights. This year she started mirror school and her first report card was less than great. We had been checking her homework but as it turns out, she had been lying to us for awhile about what all of her homework was. 

As a result, we met with her teachers to game plan. She has a planner she must write her homework in and get signed by each teacher, and we check it every day. (The low grades were from not doing the work, not that she didn’t get it). And until her grades are up, no TV. She’s not grounded from anything else, she can go out with friends or use the computer to talk to them. It’s just the TV because it obviously kept coming before school. She was upset at first but then agreed.

Fast forward a week. My son (17) got a movie after work and wanted to watch it. My husband and I agreed. My daughter was getting ready to watch it and I reminded her no TV. She left the room upset. Later she told me this new rule often left her feeling left out as we can all watch TV but she can’t. We do watch TV at night, but if she wants to do other stuff we can.

We have decided to be childfree unless financial circumstances change as I am the main breadwinner and we cannot afford to sustain a household (especially with a new baby) without my salary. We have discussed my partner taking a long paternity instead of me taking maternity but he didn't seem exceptionally keen and I'd rather not risk him regretting his decision later down the line. 

So essentially for the foreseeable future we can't really have children which doesn't bother me in the least (I know I will likely be challenged on this, but honestly guys I'm totally fine with not ever having my own child).

Anyway I've always admired the idea of being a surrogate for somebody and I've looked into the laws etc here in the UK. I'd like to think that my working reproductive system might actually benefit someone who really needs it and is desperate. I've brought it up with my partner and he was very vehemently against it. In fact he almost seemed to find the idea repulsive. It really upset me to see him so incredulous that I would even suggest it and basically said it was totally out the question.

I've casually mentioned surrogacy members of my family who also seemed to think it was ""weird"" or unnatural. I haven't really brought it up since, to them or my partner, but I can't help but feel like maybe this is something I should really do for someone, despite what he or my family may think about me.

AITA if I consider looking further into surrogacy despite his wishes?. Am I the asshole?","YTA. While I think it's really cool of you to want to help others, pregnancy will impact a huge part of your life, even if it's just for nine months.

GF was texting in the group chat how she was trying to have less negativity in her life by working on being less jealous and by holding less grudges. F said that jealousy and grudges aren't bad and can be healthy. GF got a little annoyed and they had a little spat. Towards the end of it I went on the chat and said that jealousy is mainly toxic.

F replied by saying that letting it control you is bad ( I agree) but using grudges as a way to avoid people isn't. Then she said that ""jealousy is natural, don't pretend you've never had it"". I never said I didn't feel jealousy. Then she said that I was basically saying that sadness is toxic. This continued and I was responding with small sentences disagreeing with her, but trying to stay calm and explain my opinion.

F kept trying to put words in my mouth and was making conclusions so I finally snapped and told her to shut up and let me tell her what I mean without being accused every ten seconds. She agreed. I explained that I thought jealousy in small doses isn't good but isn't super bad, but that jealousy is a slippery slope that can easily lead to toxic emotions.

F changed the topic to grudges and said they were healthy and useful for getting rid of toxic people. I sent her the Google definition which said that grudges are persistent feelings of bad feelings (which made F's point invalid because she said you could forget about a grudge for years at a time). F just said a persistent thought is impossible.

I gave her a personal example of what I've gone through with jealousy as I have a lot of feelings of inferiority that stem from being jealous.  F told me that those feelings weren't toxic and that there was a big difference between being sad and being so jealous it's toxic.

We argued some more, and finally I told her that jealousy isn't healthy and that I was done with the argument. F just responded by saying that she thought jealousy was neutral and there was not hurry to fix it.

Background, my parents didn’t like the idea of me driving to another state by myself so most of the time I drove with someone when going to see her.

Gf was having a bad week, me being the amazingly perfect boyfriend decided I should drive there to make her week better.

So I started to make the plans, I brought it up to my parents, but they said no because I didn’t have anyone to ride with me, so I begged constantly to see if anyone I knew could ride with me, I had no luck.

Eventually I bring it up again and complained that I had money if anything were to go wrong during the drive there & back, so I should be able to just go. Again, they said no because things need to be fixed in your car.

This is where I created my master plan.
My uncle has a lot of experience in working on cars, so I save up extra money, have him fix the one thing wrong with my car.

Then I asked my parents if I could “spend the night at my friends house” of course they said yes, so after asking. I packed my belongings without being caught into my car, later that day, it was time for me to leave. And so I did, I drove 4 hours until I received a message from my brother wondering where I was at, I didn’t answer. I continue on all the way to Wisconsin.

Once I was there, the next day, I ended up receiving a lot more messages from him and my parents, I had to explain where I was. They. We’re. Furious. I had left the state without telling anyone a word of what I was doing, you can imagine how worried they were.

They insisted I come straight home in which I protested and said a firm no, I was staying the whole time I planned. 
Which was originally just 1 week.

Half way through the week they even threatened to report my car as stolen and have a warrant out for my arrest & have my car taken back but me leave here.(the car was in their name, not mine) I was fully prepared to stay as my cousin was who I was staying with.

Needless to say that never happened. But there’s more, something happened which I don’t remember what exactly, but because of it, I couldn’t leave after that first week. In the end I ended up staying in Wisconsin for 3 weeks total.

Eventually got home, and shit hit the fan. Everyone was baffled as to how I could do such a thing. Therefore, I one upped my cousin, who was already the black sheep of the family, in turn gained mad respek 😂

40140,"AITA for playing my guitar at a campfire of people I didn't know?. I am currently on a solo road trip across the country to just experience life. So far everyone I've met has been generally really cool and I've made some friends I plan on seeing again. 

I am currently at Grand Tetons and spent a lot of time out on the lake yesterday. When I got back it was pretty chilly so I saw some people about my age (early 20s) having a campfire. I got a sixer of my absolute gnarliest IPA and my guitar and walked over to say hello and hopefully make some friends. 

Everyone was cool at first and I handed out all six of my beers and got a Bud in return. I was cool with that since they were being cool. I just started lightly strumming my guitar as I was chatting with this really cool girl. She asked me if I knew ""3 little birds"" by Bob Marley so I started playing it. 

All of the sudden this dude just started making fun of me. I don't know exactly what he said but it was like ""we're all friends from Indiana University and this douche thinks he can play guitar over our conversation"" (again not exact but I know he mentioned IU  and called me a douche). The girl I was talking to said don't worry about him and asked me to keep playing so I kept playing. The guy got up and got literally in my face and said that if I didn't take my guitar and get the fuck out so he could talk with his girl friend he was going to shove it up my ass, then burn it then throw it in the lake. This time even the girl didn't stick up for me and I said that it was really lame to take my beer and not be cool. He said IPA is shit for hippies and burn outs from Oregon (good call for a dumb ass, he nailed that) and that it made me smell like shit. I got up and left and the entire group was laughing at me as I left, even the girl who asked me to play the song. I was camped a few spots over from them and I could hear them partying for a long time but they were gone before I woke up this morning. 

It was such and unnerving experience, was I the asshole there? I don't want to make that same mistake again.

edit: using a throwaway since I've shared an outline of my intermarry on my main account.. Am I the asshole?","ESH. The guy was a douche about it and over reacted, no argument there. But seriously, if she wanted you to play and other people there already made it clear that they didn’t want to listen to it, just go somewhere else. I like live music and all of that stuff but sometimes when you’re hanging out with friends and drinking and talking, you don’t want some random guy you don’t know to just whip out and start playing a guitar. 

Just randomly breaking out a guitar around a bunch of people you don’t know and starting to play unprompted and without asking if it’s okay is just kind of obnoxious to begin with, to not stop when people there have made it clear they aren’t interested just makes it worse. If she was the *only* one sticking up for you, it stands to reason that most of the people there didn’t want you playing, either. 

A good rule of thumb is that unless the people you’re with ask you to play, they probably don’t want you to. Especially if they don’t even know you.

Okay, so I live with my Grandparents, and when they brought me into their custody, I was diagnosed with severe depression. Sometimes I go on walks by myself when I’m in the mood for doing it, and it’s relaxing.

I try to tell her that I’m simply not on the mood for it, but still, she insists because she “needs the fresh air for her lungs and body”... even though nothing changes if she walks by herself.

80369,"AITA for putting my cat in jail. Like many zoomers, my life revolves around my cats. My roommate and I have two: one is older and loafs all day, one is younger (**EDIT: 3 years old, not a kitten**) and quite a firecracker. She repels off the walls, play fights the older one (they both enjoy this), runs in circles around the house, knocks things over — only at night. Like many cats, she is nocturnal. She wreaks enough feline havoc that when she moved in (with roommate) she was keeping us up all night. So about a year ago we started crating her during the night. She is in a crate in the kitchen from about 11PM to about 7AM every night. There are blankets for her to burrow in and toys. She gets fed several hours beforehand so she has time to use the box before bedtime. I always thought this was normal and didn't know why other people who complained about their cats didn't also do it. I grew up with dogs and while they were puppies we always crated them during the night.

The other day I had some new acquaintances over and the subject of cat jail came up. They were appalled that we put her in the crate at night. I explained that she doesn't cry or get upset. They thought it was unfair that we crate one cat and not the other. The other cat doesn't need to be crated. They claimed that cats just do what cats do, and we're supposed to just put up with it. Our cat would rather roam free all night, but she's not upset by sleeping in the crate.

AITA for crating my cat during the night?

TL;DR New friends find out cat sleeps in a crate. Controversy ensues.

53569,"WIBTA If I told my girlfriend that I really hate her friends?. I've been together with my girlfriend for 9 months now, and she has this group of friends that are also her classmates which I got introduced to after meeting her. 

I never really liked them but stuck with the group because they were her friends and I didn't want to come off as rude. I was friends with them for like 6-7 months and then I really decided to just leave that group all together because firstly I never liked them and second of all i never felt like they wanted to include me in their group. So I figured it would be better if I left the group all together which turned out ugly. I had a spat with one of the group members before leaving so ironically they removed me from the group.

When that happened, my girlfriend for somewhat reason wanted to sort things out between me and her group of friends but I had told her many times that I didn't want to be friend with those people and it will be better if she didn't bring it up but she did. She called up everyone and then, those 'friends' of her all turned against me and started saying bs about me while she just stood there and said nothing. 

Later when I dragged myself away from there with my girlfriend, she started to cry stating how they weren't really her friends and how they broke her trust. I had to console her for like 2-3 hours even though after she was the one who called all this and etc.

But in the upcoming week after the incident she started to talk to them like nothing happened by stating that she wanted to talk to people in her class and had no one to talk to (she does have people to talk to).  I used to ignore them or would just walk away when they met in public but now it has started to bother me more. It seems as if now she has totally forgotten how everything happened and doesn't care even if I am right next to her and they turn up.

 So WIBTA if I told her that I hate her friends and I feel she isn't respecting me?

I'm going to keep some details vague because  this is a throwaway for the usual reasons but basically my significant other (SO) and I have been together for 15+ years, have children together, share finances,  etc. the same as any married couple but we are not married. We have discussed it and decided it's not for us.

My MIL is quite involved in our lives, which is fine and for the most part we get along well. My biggest annoyance is that whenever I introduce her to someone as ''this is my mother-in-law, her name', she will laugh and say something like, 'well, not really, because she isn't married to my son'. It makes things unnecessarily awkward.

Recently, we all attended a social occasion where there were a number of people MIL had never met and she said it every. single. damn. time. After about the fifth time I spoke quite harshly and said she was being ridiculous with her comment, and she shot back saying it was inappropriate to present myself as married when I wasn't. She then left the event early and hasn't spoken to me in three weeks now. My SO has confirmed she's angry at me and has suggested I apologise so we can all move on. 

I don't see why it's such a big deal, since mother-in-law may not be technically correct but it's the simplest way to describe a relationship that qualifies in every other way except a marriage certificate.

Now we are living by our own, therefor we came a bit later for christmas at our moms house, because we celebrated at first with our dad.

So when we got into the house my younger siblings already unpacked their presents. My sister (14) got a dirtbike, my brother (13) an I Phone and my youngest sister (10) got a bike.

At first my sister and I gave our present to our mom (and her husband), which was a 100€ dinner coupon, for a really nice restaurant. Then my sister got hers and as she opened it I was preety bumped and surprised. It was 2 bottles of bodywash.

She also had a daughter who's 1 year younger than me, we didn't hit it off either. Don't get me wrong she's a totally fine person but as kids she was the typical brat so I guess it made it hard for us to really bond as kids I guess. Once I hit my teens I had a rough patch of being rebellious and overall not a good person, my dad gave me space like I needed but my step mom didn't see it that way and we fought a lot cause of it. My step sister was alright during teen years she got the more quiet and keep to yourself so we didn't have really any conflict.

More recently however we have been staying at my place exclusively because I had a falling out with one of her roommates. I can provide more details in the comments if anyone cares but essentially it ended with two of her roommates saying that I wasn’t allowed at their apartment. 

To us this seems unfair because they have their boyfriends over whom she doesn’t like so why should I be excluded from coming over to their apartment? Regardless she has been sneaking me over in private for the past 5 months when she wants me to come over. I’ve put up with it for the most part because I want to respect her wishes and obviously don’t want to cause her trouble with her roommates.

Tonight however she invited me over and I said I would come. But then she said “Okay I don’t wanna hide you but like don’t talk too loud bc only [my roommate and her boyfriend] are here and they’re asleep.” Basically saying that she does want to hide me since they wouldn’t know I’m coming over.

If only I could see what the messages say and not just the basic info. But it was messages from about 4-5 different numbers all day everyday.

Then today I check again and there’s one of the married woman’s number. However he has gotten smart and I think he downloaded a texting app so all the other numbers don’t show up anymore so I can’t see if he’s talking to other ones. But his phone is always with him no matter what and I even see him try to hide it when we go to bed bc he knows if I look in it we will be done.

Ten years ago, my sister had a miscarriage. Obviously, it was devastating for her and the whole family and it took her a couple of years to fully heal from it. We're still not 100% sure why it happened, but it was a one off and she's since had three very healthy, beautiful children, including a set of twins. 

So here's the thing. My sister and I don't really get on. She resented me as a kid because she had to share mum's attention and because she thought mum left her dad to be with mine. Never really grew out of that resentment and she was pretty much my biggest bully throughout childhood and my teenage years. One thing she absolutely cannot stand is when  mum and I do things without her, or when mum pays more attention to me than to her. When this happens she calls mum and says she's feeling really upset about the miscarriage and without fail mum goes running. This includes a trip to Paris I took mum on for her birthday earlier this year, which she cut short because sister said she needed her. Also includes when I had a manic episode so bad I was hospitalised and sister managed to need mum every time she was planning to visit me and so she never did. Note, these times when mum is spending more time with me than her are the only times sister brings up what happened and certainly the only times she still gets so upset about it. 

So recently I was sick. Like, don't leave the bathroom for days, can only keep water down sick. Didn't manage to get the doctor, but I think it was norovirus. It lasted about a week Mum was popping in daily on her way home from work to check on me and stuff. On the last day of being seriously unwell, when I felt I could eat again, Mum offered to make me some soup while she was there, which I accepted. She was halfway through making it when sister called her saying she was upset about the miscarriage and she told me I'd have to finish it myself because she had to go. I didn't say anything to Mum and I finished making the soup, but I sent my sister a text saying she really needs to stop bringing it up for attention because she can't bear me getting some instead. I guess she told mum and her dad because I'm hearing from all sides what a horrible, insensitive, selfish bastard I am and how dare I say that to her. I understand she may still be traumatised, I just think it's really weird how that trauma solely manifests whenever I'm getting attention and she isn't. AITA?. Am I the asshole?","NTA ten years?

now every time they were technically asking me to leave, but ive never successfully been able to say no. whenever i say no they get pouty and there’s an awkward tension in the room until i change my mind. i also feel guilty saying no because they dont have anywhere else to go; their bf had to get a restraining order against his roommate it’s so bad and his living room constantly has people filing in and out. but ours doesnt; we only have one other roommate and he’a fairly quiet so they would have some privacy if they used the living room. last week our third roommate went on a trip so it was just me and my roommate; they invited their bf over and kicked me out even though they literally would have had the same amount of privacy in the living room as they would in the bedroom bc i was the only other person in the dorm. i tried to say no because being kicked out means i have to lug all my stuff out there and their only argument was that the couch was “uncomfortable”

I am on mobile. 
I dont write so good.1a And this is a 30 year long issue, so I'll try to reply to any comments for clarification. 

My mother is a drug addict, from a long line of addicts, who had kids who became addicts. 
My mother is in prison currently, set to be released thursday.

I'm not free of this issue completely. I have a drinking problem, but my 2 sisters have kids and one is in prison with my mother. 

I was sent to live with my sober father when I was 3. It was the best day of my life. And it was hard being raised as a single daughter to a single father. We had a lot of issues. I have a lot of issues. I struggle hard with chronic depression and generalized anxiety. 

My mother is supposed to get out of prison for the 600th (obvs /s but shes been in and out my entire life) time on thurs. 
She broke me down a lil over a month ago, saying my town was the only town she could stay sober in and I tend to agree, she has the best opportunity here. 

But i feel like i was manipulated into agreeing to let her stay, and now that its days away I'm having a total break down and want to tell her she cant stay with me. 

.This would devastate her plans.
.Shes a crack head / meth head and im scared.

So my step kids are 6 and 8. They’ve been in school for 3 + 2 years respectively. My husband and her used to do parent teacher interviews together, however in every single one she’d speak over him when he had questions about the kids learning, how to help them at home, etc, and tell him he’s “dumb” (he’s dyslexic but he doesn’t want his kids to go the same way) and it got to the point where he was ashamed to go in and ask questions. I ended up scheduling my husband and I our own interview times away from his ex, which the school also agreed with and encouraged as they too felt each parent could speak more freely without the other there.

Now to today. The kids have interviews this week. I booked them 4 weeks ago when the slots opened up. It’s been in every newsletter for the last month. Today his ex tells us she hasn’t booked interviews and is demanding to come to ours. We’ve said no and she’s pushing it, saying that I (as their step mother) have less of a right to be there than she does. Which I’m not arguing with, I know she’s their mother and I’m not. But there are still slots open, albeit not within an hour of each other, but again, she’s known for a month and didn’t book and is still refusing to book.

41930,"WIBTA if I wished her a happy birthday. Hi all! I would super appreciate some advice on this. Normally I would go to the person this post is about (Sally) for advice, but you'll see why I can't in a moment.

So Sally is my former supervisor, she recently moved to a new company for better hours and less commute, and to say I was sad is an understatement. I worked under her for over a year and in that time she has become a mother  figure to me. My own mom lives far away, and she has even said how much better she feels knowing I have Sally here watching out for me. That's how close we are. We text every day still even though she left.

Now to where I am needing advice, Sally's birthday is this week and a few of us have gotten together to plan a surprise dinner on her birthday near her current office. A few days ago one the guys that's part of the plan decided that all day we should pretend we've forgotten her birthday and text her during the day business as usual. Personally it makes me really uncomfortable, because all day everyone Sally cares about is going to text her but never once bring up her birthday. Additional we have to leave work early to make this plan work and I haven't gotten approval yet, so there's a chance I won't even get to participate in the surprise dinner portion. Just the ""forgetting"" her birthday all day part.

I brought up my concerns to the group and said it would make her sad all day and effectively ruin her birthday to do it this way. no one agrees with me and everyone has agreeded to move forward with this plan. They all say it'll make the surprise so much better and I'd be an asshole to ruin this.

BUT from my perspective I pay more of our expenses so I feel she can contribute more in the household duties to help make it equal... she didnt like that and we got in a big argument. I told her I would do my half of the chores if she pays her half of the bills. In total it was an extra $300 per month she would have to pay to make it equal. She was annoyed but agreed she would contribute equally to her half of the bills  if we both were responsible for our own half of the cleaning. OK that was fine with me.

The next day I called a cleaning company and hired them to come out once per week to clean the house. They send out 3 people for 45mins and each visit is $50 for a total cost of $200 per month. In addition I have been cleaning up any dishes I use as soon as I am done with them. 

I told her they would show up staring Friday and she was furious. She said I cant get out of my obligation by just hiring people, and that we both should be spending the same amount of time cleaning.

We are a three piece, including myself, the drummer and our guitar player. We ended up renting a small rehearsal space for quite a bit of money. The reason for this is because we had no other option for a place to rehearse, and this one was closest and also cheapest. All 3 of us are in school and have jobs. Guitar player has 2 other bands as well. When we agreed to rent, it would be roughly $130 per person a month. No issue everything was great, no complaints. We dedicated Sunday afternoons to meet and practice with each of us writing and recording on our own at home during the week. All of a sudden guitar player couldn’t make the payment anymore. His reasoning was “$130 is too expensive to only be there 4 times a month”. Fair enough. This led to me and the drummer splitting the bill, ending with $200 each. To compensate guitarist would buy equipment we needed. We are determined to do anything that will work including higher bill. We begin meeting twice a week, Friday and Sunday now. Fast forward 6 months. Roughly 2 months ago drummer was having a really hard time and didn’t know if they could pay the next payment, same with myself. When I brought it up with guitar player he said “we have to keep it. I know for sure we won’t ever do anything if we don’t keep this”. We bite the bullet and continue paying. Forward 2 months: Now I receive a text from guitar player saying he can’t meet on Fridays anymore because he has started another band. I explained thoroughly to him that we were not okay with that. I’m not against his other projects at all, we’ve always supported his projects and do everything we can to help out. But we are paying money to ensure we have a place to practice. Within the last 6 months, guitar play compensate with a single $20 item. He bought a mini fridge at goodwill. We discuss; he’s says he’s not obligated to be there, which I told him is correct.

I’ve seen his butt crack more times than my own at this point. His hands are so sticky you can see the finger prints after he touches paper and he smells like death. Like my dog after she has rolled in a dead bird.

He’s been sick the past two weeks but still goes to school. The entire row in front of his seat has been sick for a week now. May be a coincidence but whatever. He always blows his nose IN class. And it’s not like just a small, quiet blow to just remove a bit of liquid. It’s full on trumpet and you can hear every drop of slime leave his nose. It has us all gagging. In my country we eat lunch in the same classroom.

Last Friday I saw snot fall from his nose, into his lap after he blew it. Half of the class turned their face away from him and visibly gagged.

He doesn’t have any friends in this class because of the things I described and he makes everyone uncomfortable with the things he says. So there’s really no one to tell him to stop.

One day during lunch he blew his nose right in front of me, and my entire group of friends gagged. I got up, said loudly “it’s honestly so damn disgusting and rude that anyone would blow their nose IN class.” And then I walked out. This was probably a dick move but I didn’t want to ‘confront’ him or for him to feel like I did.

Everyone else goes to the toilet to blow their nose etc. He clearly heard what I said and yet he continues to do it. Even my teachers are disgusted.

The ""we"" are all close friends of mine that I met in school.

Since around 4-5 shots, some of the girls became acting a little...inappropriate, they started trying to poor juice down a mug, which eventually fell and caused all the juice to splatter onto the floor, they poured too much vodka which sometimes caused it to spill, AND the vodka was pure shit, disgusting.

Also after that they used some of my moms nail polish to paint some of the nails, I felt that's a little over the top.

Couple all of these, after all 4 shots ( I was still sober at the time ) My straw broke when one of my female friends tried to pour grape juice into a cup and it spillt, onto the floor and onto my legs.

After that I just simply, stood up, and walked to my room.


Several of them came to my room to try to get me out of it, they said they were having fun or something, they cleaned up, yada yada yada. 


I said that I didn't care, drink on your own or whatever, but my mood is totally buzzkilled, I don't feel like drinking because of the shitty vodka and the mishaps that happened.


They eventually called me an asshole for being a ""party pooper"" and continued to drink.


I don't blame them for counting the drinking, I blame them for calling me an asshole.

It all started when I screwed up pretty badly in work, to the point where I'm seriously afraid that I might get fired, and I really can't afford to lose this job. Then my car broke down, and I have to fork out some big bucks to get it repaired. Then the tipping point happened, my mother was just diagnosed with cancer, news I did not take lightly. After all this, I decided to not go to the party, I texted my friends and didn't give them any details, but they understood.

9298,"AITA for getting someone at work fired. I'll start off by saying that the guy that got fired is one of our shift leads. He is an asshole plain and simple. From here on out I will call him Dan. Dan has a mentality that since he's one of our leads, he doesn't have to do anything and puts all of the work on other employees. People have complained about his attitude but nothing has ever been done about it. 

To make matters worse, he sleeps. Every. Single. Shift. We work in a field where if you fall asleep and miss a call, it could be the difference between literal life and death. Sleeping is also against the rules for multiple reasons.

So onto the story. Every day before our shift starts we have a briefing on everything that happened the day/shift before and the supervisors/directors talk about things that need to be fixed or worked on or just announcements for the department. During this briefing, the previous crew usually waits outside of the briefing room so they can give us a passdown on missing/used equipment. On this particular day there were only two other co-workers that were on the previous shift. One of the co-workers was waiting outside as usual while Dan was nowhere to be found.

I had a hunch that Dan was inside our office sleeping like usual. I went into the surveillance room where there just so happens to be a monitor for the camera inside our office. Lo and behold, he's knocked out asleep. Knowing full well where he was, I asked my direct supervisor ""hey, do you know where Dan is at? He's not up here yet"". My supervisor said that he didn't know where Dan was at and that he will call Dan over the radio.

Dan did not answer to his radio. So my supervisor went into the surveillance room to check and see if Dan was in the office. My supervisor saw in plain view that Dan was fast asleep. This conducted an investigation into Dan to see how long he has been sleeping for and for how often. After a few days the investigation concluded and Dan was promptly terminated.

I feel bad because asking my supervisor where Dan was lead to him getting the boot, but in my eyes he shouldn't have been breaking the rules that could lead to someone else dying. 

So, AITA for inadvertently getting Dan fired?

72656,"AITA Offering my friend a PA job instead of the a manager position when he came to me for a job?. My friend ""Stacy"" graduated from college several months ago and she has had trouble finding a job in her field, she chose an educational route that is pretty much over crowded with people and whatever extra classes she took were in things like history or social studies which while enjoyeable do not offer much of a cushion to fall back on so to say.

As a result she ended up asking me for a position and despite her not really being qualified I am not opposed to filling the PA position with someone without the proper degrees since it involves stuff that is easy to pick up on and given we will be spending a lot of time together it might as well be a good friend, right?

When I told her about the job she got offended and said she had figured she'd get the Manager position given she is ""Well educated"" and I should be aware she works hard, which is true.

Now here is the thing, this position requires someone with an IT background and it is logical to me that I end up promoting one of the people already working here, instead of hiring someone else. Also she simply lacks the qualifications and it would take months at the bare minimum to teach her the basics.

Also let me be clear the PA position pays really well, only a few hundreds below what she would be making at a good job in her own field also given she can't get a job it just seems rude to even complain, regardless I feel bad because she is a close friend..

I reflexively grabbed the oh-shit handle, the dog and yelled, ""Watch out, holy shit there is another car!"" so that he would stop. We didn't hit the car, got off at the next exit, crisis averted. 

Immediately afterwards he scolded me for yelling, my tone etc. I realize it's not cool to yell in crisis, but I am really tired of excuses like, "" I didn't see it, there was a blind spot, etc."" when there isn't, it's just not paying attention / bad driving.

We have a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom so its not like hes using my personal space but they use our living room all the time. I wouldnt really mind if they were watching tv together or doing something together in our shared space, but its just him using the tv to play games while she studies next to him. They often eat directly on the couch leaving crumbs. He also brings his laundry to our apartment even though he has his own house with a washer/dryer. I asked her about this and she said it's because he doesnt know how to make his clothes smell good so she does it for him!!

All of this wouldnt bother me much, except using our washer/dryer because we pay for the utilities, but recently he has started to come over when shes not even here. He will just walk into our apartment, no knocking as if it was his own. Most of the time he stays in her room while shes at class. Hes also using the tv to play games when shes not here too.

So my friend (18f) recently started seeing this guy (18m) that she met in one of her classes (they're in college.) The thing is doesn't yet want an actual relationship right now. Well, this was his first romantic encounter with a woman *ever* and he was under the impression that after a few dates they were in a relationship (by a few I mean like three or four.)

She doesn't want to be in a relationship with him because A) she feels it went to fast and B) he's a virgin, which is FINE. She's allowed to not want to date him, I don't fault her for wanting to end it...but rather than *telling* him she's no longer interested, she's decided to keep up contact with him until the semester ends and she doesn't have to see him again, then just fade on out.

I personally think that it's a dick move to lead him on until it's convenient for her to drop off the face of the planet.

Anyways, so she texts me last night and asks if she can just rant to me because she was upset about something that happened with one of her ex boyfriends. I said sure and she started in.

I cut the rant off when she blamed leading this poor boy on on her ex and how shitty he was (he wasn't abusive, just very fickle) and told her I wasn't going to be a sounding board for her to feel better about herself for doing something bad.

After that, radio silence from her until I call her today. She was still upset about it, which is understandable, and told me that she's ""sorry she can't be the perfect person I expect her to be.""

I told her that I wasn't expecting her to be a perfect person, I just wanted her to not do clearly shitty things and I don't want her to feel better for doing something shitty, because she should feel bad for leading him on.

My sister and BIL are late 30s and have 2 boys who are about to be 8. We grew up religious but I am no longer religious, my sister and her family remain religious. 

Recently we were at dinner and it finally happened, one of the boys started asking questions and said it was “weird” that we’re married. I get it, they’ve only mostly been exposed to men and women being married and the traditional family structure (“when you’re older you get married and buy a house, have kids etc”). The table got quiet and nobody said anything. I initially was going to say that sometimes boys like boys and girls like girls and they get married. It’s true and based in reality, but I figured my sister might see that as me trying to indoctrinate her children, so I said nothing and we changed the subject.

When the whole Arthur cartoon same-sex marriage thing happened just precious to this, we had a very brief discussion where my sister said that it wasn’t my place to think a cartoon should explain that to kids. I stressed to her that you can explain it, bc it’s something that does happen and it doesn’t have to be sexualized in any way. Whether or not parents teach them that gay couples are in the wrong is on them, but it’s an unavoidable reality that children will see same-sex couples together.

Me and my ex-girlfriend have been together during the last two and a half years and separated a month ago due to differences. During most of our relationship she has been living at my place where she has paid half the rent. After the break-up I agreed that she could stay as she is moving across the country in two months, and I felt bad for making her move out all her stuff just to move it again soon. There is no bad blood between us and we have had a friendly relationship, while living together as friends during the breakup period. 

However, she asked me recently if I could move out for five days to let her parents stay at our place and sleep in our beds, as her graduation is coming up and she wanted them to attend. I told her that I thought it was a weird request and it would be weird to let them sleep at my place considering we are just friends at this point. I also don't have any relationship to them as they don't speak English, and I've only met them a few times where I basically couldn't speak with them. They feel like strangers to me, and especially now that we are not together anymore. 

Now, we live in a wealthy country, but her parents are from another country with a lower income than ours. Renting a hotel room here is quite expensive for them compared to their own prices at home. I suggested that they could use AirBnB or a hostel as I found places that cost half the price of the hotels, but they ended up picking a hotel for themselves anyway. Now my ex-girlfriend is very annoyed at me because I didn't let them sleep here to save them the expenses and she has started acting more cold and distant in general which has made me feel terrible about my decision.

Later on I consulted two of my close friends about it to give me an honest answer about whether I was in the wrong or not, and they both told me that I did nothing wrong and that she could not expect that of me. They both claim that I only feel bad about it because I still love her, where the part about still loving her is true. We broke up because of differences, not because we don't care about each other.

We weren’t being overly loud and it was like 6.30pm so I felt this was unreasonable. I called back “calm down mate we’re not even being loud.”

The man yelled again “I said keep it the fuck DOWN!” At this point I’d had enough and I stood up and yelled back “mate get fucked!” There was a soccer ball at my feet and I kicked it at the fence roughly where he was standing.

We paid her a $300 deposit that was to be returned 60 days after care, according to the contract.   She then refused to send, saying she'll send at the end of Dec.  I had sent her a demand letter via text and she said she'd pay on Dec 31 and if I kept asking, she would go to the police for harassment.  And if my lawyer persued, she'd withhold until the court decided. 

I had posted on FB the situation but didn't say what the darcare was. I was very careful to only state the facts and didn't bad mouth her. Then I got nearly 10 people PM me about experiences they had, and they knew who I was talking about just from what I said.

Then I decided to post the name of the business and lady in the comments.

The next morning people were messaging me a post she made about me, that I couldn't see cause she had blocked me earlier.   

In this post, she is making up lies (like she drove me to the ER, gave us freezer meals) to I guess make me seem like a horrible person, for demanding my $300 back.

42257,"AITA for basically telling my sister to go screw herself?. Basically not a good title, but a fun story. 

I am in college and I am trying to get my degree. As all students. I use my savings wisely (Only drinking when I know I have enough money). I try to never ask for money by my parents because they aren't very stable. I needed a desktop and I worked at a mini market to get enough money to buy my own one (very slow but does the job). 

Now a little background. My family is very strange to say the least. They have allot of drama and I am that one person in the family that doesn't care who did what. This means that all of stories come to me. So I hear along the grape vine that my sister is telling evryone that I am spunging off of my parents, and because my sister is my fathers bleu eyed child. I started to hear a few rumors going around of me only calling when I need money. 

I have anger problems. Everyone in the family knows this but some (my sister) doesn't understand it. So basically at our family Christmas get together, I did what I usually do. I hand out the Christmas presents for everyone. (I always do it because I am the youngest) As a college student I really didn't have money so I bought chocolates for everyone (not too cheap not too expensive) while my grandmamma and mother got flowers as well and my dad a corn pype. I then hear my sister's voice saying these words ""how cheap"". I leave it because I don't want to start a scene, but get a little mad. I keep quiet the whole time. As soon as I open the present I got I shook it and said to my mother ""sounds like socks"" (My mother never knows what to buy me so she lets me buy my own, and I needed socks so I chose socks) As my mother starts giggling my sister snaps. ""How dare you even say something like that, You are spoiled with a bloody computer and this is the thanks you give"" (this was about the just of what she said, might not be exact). So basically I had my last straw and without thinking I say (still infront of mother and grandma made) ""Go f#ck yourself and let the corner of the street rest a bit"".

His latest batch of kids with the most recent baby momma are in and out of foster homes due to the mothers drinking and drug habits and also domestic abuse because of the types of men she chooses to shack up with.

Today I (34f) heard from my mother that my brothers daughter (11 year old) has been put in a foster home in another city when usually she'd be placed with another member of her mother's family but apparently they have issues as well. My brother suggested to my mom that I take his daughter for 6 months. 

Currently my brother lives with another woman with a handful of her kids. He hasnt stepped up to take in his own kids yet is expecting me to do something about it cause I don't have kids, am not married so apparently my life doesn't seem to matter.

If I do this now, it'll likely be a lifetime thing and I'll end up taking in his other kids as well, my nephew and 2 other step nephews. So 4 kids total. 

My extended and immediate family is a train wreck and my first thought is that it's best for the kids to be in a foster home far away from our dysfunctional family so at least they'll have stability somehow or a chance at a somewhat decent life if they're lucky. 

Am I the asshole for not sacrificing my life for this despite not having anything going on right now?

Background info: I'm a student in uni, and i live about 700 miles away from home.

&#x200B;

However, as the semester is ending, I have no where to store the bear over the summer and I can't ship it home. I don't really need a giant teddy bear in my dorm room/room at home and while I really appreciated the gift, it was obvious I needed to do something with it.

My sister suggested just throwing it in a dump, but I emailed around and found an organization that helps kids/families dealing with pediatric cancer. A person from that organization that conducts fundraising reached out to me saying they auctioned off a similar bear for $750 last year, and the money would be put to a good cause.

&#x200B;

However, I can't help but to feel a little bit guilty, since this was a big bear + probably costed a lot of money + kind of sentimental. I asked my friend what he thought, and he seemed kind of ambivalent /maybe a little sad?

My mom (42F) had finished her shift from work and was waiting at the bus station today. The next bus which would take her home would come in 15 minutes according to the schedule. It was raining quite hard this day and it was around 3 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, I (17M) was at home playing a Ranked League of Legends game (A ranked game is a bit more serious than a casual game). She called me asking if I could come pick her up since the next bus wouldn’t be here for another 15 minutes. I said that I could not since I was in the middle of my game and that I couldn’t pause it. Leaving the game halfway could result with me getting temporarily/permanently banned or facing in game restrictions. I told her to walk home, wait for the bus, or wait for my game to finish if she wanted me to pick her up. She didn’t want to wait and ended up getting mad at me over the phone. She lectured me afterwards once she got home about how I don’t care about my family, never help around the house, etc. I tried to defend myself against her comments but it ended up escalating the argument, so I decided to to just not say anything afterwards. Unfortunately that didn’t work out either and ended up making her even angrier. 

I don’t play video games too often anymore since I’m usually busy with school work on the weekdays, so the only time I’m really playing videos games ever is on the weekend. Even then, I usually spend my free time during the weekend out with friends, playing hockey, etc. so I limit my gaming time. 

My mom is also very hardworking and dedicated. She’s often working 1 or 2 shifts each day and works long hours to help pay off all the debt our family is under (mortgage, bills, etc.).

My bf lived in CA had an open invite to come visit me in IN whenever he wanted, which works well—in theory—because he’s an independent contractor who sets his own schedule. I’m a grad student who got formally reprimanded when I took time off to fly home when my grandmother died unexpectedly. 

Anyway...I can sometimes get off from work if I requested it months in advance. A bestie of mine (female) invited me to spend a week with her hiking in Montana, so I requested time off and spent a week with her exploring Montana. My bf —who always tells me he hates the west, has chronic back pain (and probably can’t physically handle consecutive days of hiking)—was fucking livid at me for going on vacation without him and we spent months fighting about it. Another thing worth mentioning is that my buddy recently went through a painful divorce and timed this trip so that we were in Montana during what would have been her 18th wedding anniversary. My bf creates a lot of drama if I go a day without sleeping with him when we hang out together, and I’d feel cruel rubbing that level of intimacy in my recently divorced friend’s face.

46207,"WIBTA if I asked my roommate not to cook a certain meal?. So I (23F) am a grad student living with 3 other roommates in an apartment. We all get along pretty well and haven't had any issues so far. 2 of my roommates cook foods from their cultures (for context, one is a Chinese immigrant and the other is a first-generation Indian/Caribbean woman named ""May"") with strong scents that I can't stand tbh but I deal with since it's their home too and I wouldn't like anyone telling me my food smells. A bit about me, I'm a first generation African-American but I cook plain ""American"" food since that's what I enjoy, so my food doesn't give off such strong smells.

So I've never considered asking anyone not to cook what they enjoy because I know how personal food is but about 40 minutes ago I stepped out of my room to heat up my dinner and instantly started coughing from all the spices in the air from what May had cooked. I honestly had to crack open the dining/living room windows in 20 degree (Fahrenheit) weather so I could breathe comfortably. And even with that I had to bring out a fan in the kitchen to try to disperse some of the spices in the air. Whatever she cooked is in the fridge so it must have been a lot of spices. Now usually, I would just ignore any food smells I don't enjoy out of respect but in this case WIBTA if I ask her not to cook that specific dish? I just want to be able to breathe in my apartment.

TL;DR Indian/Caribbean often cooks dishes with strong smells I don't like but I ignore the smells because it's her home too. Tonight she cooks something so strong that when I step out of my room, I start coughing and have to open the windows in 20 degree weather. WIBTA if I asked roommate not to cook this dish again?

Update:  
I sent her a text basically saying I'm so sorry to ask but the spices in her meal were strong enough to trigger me to cough a lot and make my throat hurt.

Asked her if she could you please not make that specific dish since none of her others had affected me like that. I reiterated that I was sorry to ask but if it hadn't affected me that much, I wouldn’t be asking. I also blamed it on our our stove fan at the end of the message since we know it doesn't do much at all.  
She responded well and said it had been bothering her too. Apparently she added pepper flakes to season her burger, which she usually doesn’t do and it reacted with the oil. So she won't be doing that again.. Am I the asshole?","Slight NAH because you’re just not used to the smells.

He had been texting our family about the baby and later told me the nurse had asked where I was after a couple of hours. I had finally slightly woken up out of my heavy sedation had barely met my son and then his sister went and held him for longer then I had. His defense is it was his first child and he thinks I'm attacking him for letting his family know that pur son had been born and says if it were my family it would be different and I agree because after having the awful birth I really wanted my mum but I think considering it all I should have been able to decide when I was ready and who I needed to be there and who I needed to stay away until the next day. Also he had kept his family seperate for years as we were young and I didn't have a close relationship with them because of this. I invited his whole family to see the baby the next day.

54521,"AITA for waking my bf up when he snores?. My bf (23M) and I (22F) have been dating for almost 3 years and living together for over a year. 

&#x200B;

My bf doesn't snore every day (he really only snores once in a while) but when he does it's like sleeping next to a jet engine (you can hear him from outside the apartment) and it is almost impossible to fall asleep. 

&#x200B;

He is a really light sleeper but is able to fall asleep really quickly. He'll usually get up a few times in the night to pee or because the cat was being needy etc. I am a really heavy sleeper but it takes a while for me to fall asleep. If he snores after I'm asleep I don't wake up at all.

&#x200B;

So the nights that he snores I might cough intentionally, or nudge him a bit, or just sit on the bed a bit more forcefully than normal so that he'll wake up and roll over. He almost always ends up back asleep in about 5 minutes or less in a different position and he won't be snoring.

&#x200B;

I kinda feel like a dick for waking him up even though he falls asleep quickly and would otherwise wake up at some point during the night, but there have been times I didn't want to wake him and I've laid awake for at least two hours unable to fall asleep and ended up extremely sleep deprived and cranky in the morning.

My best friend (18M) and I (18F) have been inseparable for 13 years. We met in school, and he's the brother I never got (lost one due to illness).

Over time, we expanded our friend group and with it, relationships inside and out of the ""circle"" have happened. No big deal.

Someone who came in late last year (18F), Lauren if you will, tried dating him 4 months ago. At the time, I was on board: his first relationship, he was beaming with happiness, no gray cloud in sight. They realized a little after it wouldn't work because she's going away for college,and he accepted it. Again, no big deal, up until she began the manipulation. ""I'm hungry/tired/need a ride"" and he goes running and pays for all of it. If we ask, ""I can't"".
He has bailed plans with his friends of 8 years and longer just to see her, overstays his welcome with her, and isn't the same person he was before. He's a hollow shell of himself and the negative behavior he absorbed goes into all of us. 

I called them both out on their behavior for the sake of the entire group, and they made me the bad guy for being honest. Everyone thought it, I said it. She /hates/ my boyfriend and has told me directly, manipulated 3 others in the group, and we have all had it. 

He isn't the same anymore and it tears me to shreds more than people know. I miss the best friend I had for years, and it's all going down the drain directly because of her. All I want is for both of us to be on good terms again, but he refuses to better himself after he promised he would. We haven't talked in about 3 weeks.

I've asked around before on what to do. Half said it's toxic all of us aren't okay with it, half said we have more than a fair right to be pissed.

I genuinely don't know what to do, and I want him happy. If it means we don't talk then so be it, but I just want the same person I grew up with and added to my family.

48597,"WIBTA for spraying liquid ass spray in my college apartment to get revenge on my roomate?. Throw Away cause people in story know my main Reddit, etc, etc. Ill try to keep this one nice and short.

I live in a 4 bedroom college apartment and all my roommates are chill. The only problem is that one of them like to smoke blunts, alot. From what he has told me he smokes half a blunt twice a day by himself. I couldn't care less that he smokes weed but the smell is what gets me and in my opinion smells like skunk.

I will know without a doubt when he is smoking in his room from the other side of our small apartment with my rooms door closed. He is well aware I am bothered with the smell and I have asked for him to find a way to make it less noticeable. (Smoking outside, opening a window, putting a towel under the door) but after a few weeks of constantly requesting the smells frequency and potency hasn't changed.

So would I be the asshole if I spray liquid ass (a product that well, smells like ass) in my own room at the exact same time he smokes weed in his? The reasoning I would spray it in my room and not the apartment living room or his room is because I would effectively be doing the same thing he is doing to me even if its at my own dispense. It would also show him that yes I can smell your weed from over here, and yes it smells like shit to me just like this smells to you.

Other people I have told about my plan have just called me a buzzkill and even a straight up asshole that should let my roommate smoke his weed in peace.

19250,"AITA for siding with my husband?. Hello everyone, I created a new account so that this wouldn't be associated with my regular one.

Three months ago I discovered that my husband was emotionally cheating on me and had plans to meet with her. She messaged me every bit of contact they had ever had when she discovered he was married and made a Facebook post that was viewed by many people in their industry. He did not lose his job, but he's not socially accepted in most circles right now. My sister is tech savvy and gained us access to all of his accounts before these confrontations happened, so I'm reasonably sure that this was the first time he had attempted to step outside of our marriage.

We've been married since we were twenty-two, I was his first. He was not mine. I had one boyfriend before him. He said this was the reason why he had wanted to have sex with another woman, because he did not have the experience like I did. 

After a lot of arguing and crying, I decided to forgive him. Please do not tell me to divorce him because he cheated, I chose to stay. I love him, but please judge the rest of this situation.

One stipulation of my forgiveness was that he had to admit what he had done to our families, including our wonderful son. We sat David down and my husband told him what happened and why we were fighting the previous few weeks, and David nodded, said thanks for telling him, then turned to me and told me he supports and loves me, but his father is dead to him. And he has stuck to his word. At family dinners he basically pretended his father didn't exist and only talked with me. 

This went on for nearly a month before my husband told us that he will not allow a person into his own home that treats him with such disrespect, that it is no one's place to judge him (except for me). David asked me if I was going to accept that, and I said yes, because it's our home and I have chosen to forgive his father. So David walked out and is not allowed back home until he's willing to be respectful to his father, but I do meet him for lunch at least once a week without my husband knowing.

But I miss him. I miss sitting at home with my only son and talking about all the fantastic things going on in his life, and it's was already difficult to find time to see him due to his own career. And sneaking around doesn't sit right with me, but my husband has a right to feel comfortable in his own home.

So AITA for siding with my husband and agreeing to bar our son from our house?

We had a good day, and until a little after noon, there had been no problems. This is around the time my dad springs it on me that his friends would be coming over in a few hours. 

Now, regardless on your stance about it that on it’s own is a shitty thing to do, it wasn’t this that really upset me. What did set me off was that these friends had kids, one of them a friend of mine. This meant I was going to have to choose between forfeiting the rest of our anniversary to hanging out with my friend, or asking him to hangout downstairs by himself for the night.

I knew my friend would be understanding, so ultimately I chose to explain the situation to him, and apologetically ask him to hangout downstairs for the night. He thankfully didn’t take it personally, and I took another two hours to watch Iron Man 3 with my girlfriend before she went home, and I went downstairs to hangout with my friend.

I had made no secret of my displeasure with my dad that day, and I didn’t hesitate to bring it up the next day. He exploded at me as soon as I told him how I felt about it, and the argument escalated to screaming quickly and has stayed there for the past couple days.

42404,"AITA for refusing a gift from a deceased relative?. My father-in-law passed away recently after a long battle with cancer. We'd had a good relationship, but he never spoke to me about his end-of-life arrangements. Apparently, though, one of the things he wanted done after he passed was to have my mother-in-law trade his vehicle with mine. I would get his much nicer, newer vehicle, and my mother-in-law would take mine as a token trade-in toward something more suitable for her. Great, right?

Unfortunately, it also appears that there was a paperwork foul-up that may leave my MIL in a much worse financial position than was expected. In researching how to handle the vehicle trade, I found out that the vehicle I'd be receiving is literally worth 8x the value of the one I'd be giving up. If my MIL kept it, she could sell it outright, pay cash for something decent for herself, and still have money left over. Which would be a real advantage to her if the paperwork issue does not resolve in her favor.

I understand why my FIL wanted me to have the vehicle, and I'm not ungrateful, but my perspective is that my MIL should be cared for first. I really don't want to go through with the trade unless I'm sure it isn't going to increase her hardship, and I've said as much.

4) I just don't really wanna go anywhere right now due to the fact I just don't see the point in most things in life. 


My dad wants me to go because:

1) We're of Pakistani descent. My grandad (who lives with my grandma and aunt) refuses to let them go on their own for cultural or safety reasons or whatever. They booked the holiday without telling him beforehand and he's flipping his shit that they did it without telling him and have no one to go with them.
2) He says that my grandmother and my aunt have helped him a lot (he's physically disabled) which is true and he wants me to go with them so they can go on holiday. His argument when I said I don't want to go is ""do it for me, if I had working legs I'd go instead"".

37833,"AITA for leaving the back door ""open""?. I am a tenant in a townhouse. I share common areas with my roommate (who is also my landlord) but have my own room and bathroom. The layout of the house is as follows: the main floor contains the kitchen, dining and living rooms, and doors leading to the garage, the deck/balcony, and the basement (all separate areas). A staircase leads to the second floor, which contains bedrooms/bathrooms. The basement has laundry and storage. 

The back door, in this case, is a sliding glass door/screen door that opens to the balcony/deck, which is only accessible through said door (the balcony is at least 15 feet off the ground with no stairs nearby). To get into the house from the balcony, you'd need a tall ladder, a pole vault, or superhuman jumping abilities. 

Today I opened the glass door part for some fresh air, but forgot to close it before I left for work. My roommate later texted me, upset, that I had left the door ""open"". I immediately apologized but she is very unhappy. (note- there weren't any storms or rain today, either).

I've come home in the past to the screen door open, and she leaves it open all night long now that winter is finally over, so I fail to see why it's only a big deal when I leave it open. I've asked her about it, but she just says I'm disrespectful of her rules.

To lay out the situation, I'm in a long distance relationship (different countries) which leads to me and my gf mostly communicating through texts and, whenever possible, talking on the phone or video calling.
My gf and I have had some problems with communication over the course of our relationship, especially because I value communication very highly and it is a little harder for her to open up because of past experiences. 
We have been working on these issues and, for the most part, it felt like things improved a lot.

The problem is during texting often times I feel like she is not actually engaging with the things I tell her. This could mean, I'm sending her a message or pic, let's say about something I did during the day, and instead of engaging with what I sent her and replying with a short ""awesome"" or something, she sends me something completely unrelated. 

For me personally it's natural to at least reply with a short message or question about what the other person mentioned but I understand that might not be the case for everyone. I was content with her telling me that she reads my messages but sometimes doesn't have anything to say about it. She also said that, even though she doesn't necessarily agree with my point of view, she will try to improve this.

This ends for me when I ask her a question and instead of answering it she completely disregards it and sends me messages about something unrelated, or sometimes even asks me a question instead, right below the one I asked her. This has happened multiple times over the past days and when I called her out on it, she got really defensive saying she probably missed it and I should ask it again if it was something important. 

Today she had an important event and I asked her three times about it, each time not getting a response even though it was the last message in the chat so that she basically couldn't miss it. This is actually making me angry at this point. 

Honestly, I don't understand how someone can just not read messages that are even right in front of them when they open up the chat.
This makes me feel like the messages I send aren't important to her and it's more about what she has to say.

7934,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend's parents to meddle with our eventual marriage?. Earlier I was with my girlfriend of two years, and we've been talking about marriage (within the next 2-3 years potentially) a bit recently. She said that she wouldn't go through with it if her parents disapproved of me. In what I feel to be a perfectly natural reaction - I got upset and we talked about it. She expressed a fear that her parents would disown her if she married someone they didn't approve of, and expressed a fear that I would treat her badly after marriage (which she has absolutely no reason to think).

Now, her parents are a bit mixed on me. Number one it's not really 'open' we're together. My girlfriend fears them disowning her over it but they know anyway. Her mother likes me (though dislikes how I'm younger than her) and her father is downright passive-aggressive towards me. Number two, I'm not from this country so that's an obvious tick against me.

She tried to console me by telling me even if they disapproved of us, our relationship would remain the same. I told her that it wouldn't and that I couldn't be with her if she let her parents stop our future wedding. She berated me for being 'too lazy to convince [her] parents"". Where as I don't feel like I should have to because I'm not dating her parents. I can respect that she values their opinion but giving them the decision like that, I feel that's bullshit.

Near the end she kinda caved in and was like ""Well fine if you can't convince them after trying I'd go through with it"". I begrudgingly accepted that, then she told me she was hurt. This was about 6 hours ago and she's still really upset about it, but I don't feel I did anything wrong.

""Hi, can you please not throw litter in your front garden"" 

and another just recently about my gate banging in the wind (it doesn't, I checked) 

""Hi just to let you know your side gate isn't bolted and bangs during the night"" 

This morning she had a builder commence building her a new shed at 0720 on a Saturday morning, crashing wood around and using a loud saw/hammering waking me up. 
I KNOW I would have got another note for this. 

I wrote one myself

""Hi, just to let you know that a builder was sawing wood in your garden at 0730 this morning. You may now stop posting passive-aggressive notes through my door""

UPDATE : 

Karen my estranged neighbour replied by posting another note through my door

"" I was not being aggressive, I was just letting you know your gate was unlocked that was all!!!""
The ""That was all"" had two exclamation marks and was double underlined so i guess this means it's war... (joke)

Funny thing is she didn't even mention the builders or apologise for the previous notes or this mornings noise.

My friend went dark a week ago, I called her few times and she didn’t respond. I guessed she is back with the guy.

If it matters I should add that he treats her quite bad, after two years of dating he still pretends they’re friends in public and doesn’t want to say they’re together. The fact that my friend tolerates this and goes back for more tells a lot about her sense of self worth.

I told my family (my mom and step-dad) about meeting this guy at work and they were pleased at first because I had been single for the past 5 years, but when I told them he was not a Christian, they were not so thrilled. They told me I should be careful, or he could take me down the 'beaten path.'

My mom told my friends I was dating the devil and needed to get me back on track. I couldn't take it anymore so one day I told her I needed to leave the house. She told me I was not allowed to leave because the van I was currently driving was not in my name.

I'm in a rural area of Alaska, and dating is slim. I've been talking to this one gal over a month now, and has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). She green lights me to come down and visit her for a weekend, Friday thru Sunday. I book my flight, get a hotel, and find out that she's working 2 of the 3 days I'm in town. Yeesh, Ok.

I work as a network technician as a subcontractor. I subcontract from the company that is owned and operated by my boyfriend. I KNOW! Don't shit where you eat!
Well, forgive me that one, what's done is done.

Here's the problem, I'm a nice person, and I think that's taken advantage of. I go on jobs ALL THE TIME that are thrown my way with very little discussion and have already been accepted assuming I will take the job. This frustrates me, we've talked about it ad nauseum and he just doesn't seem able to understand why this makes me angry.

I had the last straw yesterday, he scheduled a return trip for a project known to be lengthy for 2100 on a Sunday. I went, did the job, and then proceeded to lose my shit all over him- meanly. I do intend to apologize for that, I know I was overly a dick (I mean way, I probably yelled for a good ten minutes) and that I can resolve problems without doing that.

But this is why:
1.) Again, wasn't consulted, I'm required to be on site or leave him high and dry, which I won't do
2.) It's my fucking Sunday man, I had just spent my Saturday finishing a separate project
3.) There was an 0800 start project the following Morning with a 2 HR drive appended. I knew we weren't getting off site for the Sunday job until at least midnight. (ended up exactly midnight) 

Sooo, the next morning, when it was time to leave. I... Didn't. During the fight he had yelled something about me not going to the next project. Therefore spitefully, I took him for it even though I had done this project before and knew what a bitch it would be to do alone. It took him over twelve hours to do alone, takes about six to seven with a second tech. 

It's the first time I've ever skipped a job on him, and I feel kind of bad, but I also feel angry and frustrated.
 He doesn't get it at all. To him, as far as I can tell, work is work is work. No days are sacred and the scheduling doesn't bother him. He claims if our roles were reversed that he wouldn't be angry, he would just show up and do the work.

I have an emotional support animal that has been registered through my university and vet. I have a couple mental disorders and the animal is very important to me as he is the only constant in my life. I have no family and he is essentially my only family. 

His birthday is coming up and per tradition I am throwing him a birthday party at our new apartment. I originally told my roommates and they agreed and had no issue, I talked about what I was gonna cook for the party and what drinks I was gonna buy for the event etc. the issue comes with the guest list. 

I stated in the beginning I did NOT want a big party. Just close friends and maybe some coworkers from my part time. Gary asked me if he could invite some friends and I said yeah because it is his apartment too and I assumed that it was just gonna be a handful of friends. A week later and the party is nearing so I sit down with my roommates to get a head count to see how much food/drink/cake to buy.

Today an Australian friend, who is very involved with this kind of stuff, has asked me to come to the ANZAC dawn ceremony and parade with him next week. 

The whole thing starts at 5am and ends at around 10am. I had gone with him the previous year out of respect and curiosity. From memory the 5 hours of standing still and not moving was discomfortable for me so I politely declined this time.

He asked me why to which I truthfully replied. As a foreigner, I have no obligation to go out of my way to pay respect to soldiers of a foreign nation. It is not my responsibility to do so, especially when 90% of Australians themselves don't do it either. I know that just because I'm not Australian doesn't mean I can't go out of my way to pay respect, it's still a nice thing to do, I just didn't feel like waking up at 5am and standing still for 5 hours.

He seemed quite angered by what I said, and told me that ""since I lived in his country I owe it to the Australian people, and that I was disrespectful towards the Soldiers who died.""

I told him that's a pretty arrogant thing to say. I got my permanent residency in Australia through a skilled worker's visa, meaning that my skills as an accountant was desired in the Australian workforce. My immigration was beneficial to both parties. I pay my taxes like everybody else and contribute to the economy, just because I live in this country doesn't mean I owe it anything.

He said that, quote, ""it's fucked up that I would rather sleep in than paying respect”, and straight-out called me an asshole.

I told him that I'm not going and that's final, and what he said before was very arrogant and offensive, and calling me an asshole needs an apology.

He told me to ""shut the fuck up"" and that ""I can't claim the moral high ground on this because I was being shitty"".

Now I totally understand someone being patriotic, I have no problem with that, but I reckon he was just being an asshole. And no he is not a veteran himself, although according to him his grandparents had served.

I didn't have the intention of giving them anything that day, and I found it rude that they just barged in so I  sarcastically played along with them. It was almost hilarious, they didn't have a clue. But when they weren't getting the hint I told them point-blank I didn't want to give them anything and I honestly didn't care about what they were soliciting. They left in somewhat of a huff.

(My parents are paying everything for the trip so we can go visit some family over there for a week). 

So I take their advice and hold off on spending money on gifts. Flash forward a month and multiple weekends of not getting shifts + some Black Friday spending on my part && gas/food and I'm back home after exams. 

Yesterday I found out that my parents have changed their mind. Christmas with the family is a go. Nobody told me.  I found out when mom asked me to help set up the decorations. Apparently my sister has already got me a gift and is expecting one from me too. I have $ 0.11 in my bank account and as soon as my paycheck comes in most of it is going to my credit card bill and a few bills from when I got sick last month and had to visit the doctor.

61230,"AITA for not closing the stall door when I went to take a pee?. I am a male and the situation is pretty simple. 

I went to a bathroom in a gas station with my step dad. He goes to the urinal and I didn’t wanna pee next to him so I went to a stall and peed there without closing the stall door. 

A guy walks in who needed to poop and waited for me to get out of there and, as per guy code nobody said a word the whole time. 

We get out of there and my step dad scolds me for leaving the door open and how I was rude to that guy for doing that.

I distinctly remember in our 2nd or 3rd date we started talking about past relationships, what we're looking for, what went wrong in the past, etc. You know, the usual stuff you talk about as you gauge whether this is something that could go somewhere or not.

I distinctly remember telling him: ""I had a few relationships in my first couple of years of college when I was really inexperienced. I regret them but I didn't do anything I regret, just the time and emotional investment."" He didn't probe and we moved on. He said  something  like ""I've also  had a few relationships.""

It's been nearly 8 months since we've been dating and in preparing to move in, we were cleaning out some old boxes when I came across a relationship notebook I had from many years back. I'd honestly forgotten it was even there. I told him I'd been writing a few pages to summarize relationships/flings after they were done and he was shocked that most of the book was filled up. I admitted over the first 3 years of college I'd been with roughly 15-20 guys.

Now Martin is a pretty alright guy, good to my mom and is a father figure to my older brother and even adopted him when he was 12 and offered to adopt me (I declined). Overall a great guy, the thing is I don't like him. I don't have a reason or anything that makes me not like him, I just don't like him. He makes my mom and brother happy and that's good enough for me. We tried the whole bonding thing for about 2 years, went to baseball games or to the arcade but we ultimately realized we had nothing in common and all our conversations became awkward or died. 

My mom really wants me to like him and doesn't see why I don't like him since he's been great to us and neither does my brother who thinks I'm just being stubborn and an ass. It's not like I ignore him or announce I don't like him, I greet him when I come home and answer his questions politely and I do try and have some conversations with him but in the end, he's just 'Martin: My mom's husband' to me. My mom (and Martin by extension) believe that the reason I don't like him is because my dad didn't like him either when he was alive, he never talked bad about Martin around me and was nice, though distant, to him when he saw him. No matter how many times I tell her that my dad has nothing to do with this, she refuses to accept that and it pisses me off because she won't accept that I just don't like him.

And I finally snapped last night when my mom and Martin sat me down to directly ask me for the hundredth time why I don't like him. Was it something he did? Do I think he's trying to replace my dad? I was tired of the questions and just honestly said that I just don't like him, no real reason. He's just not my type of guy. Both of them seemed hurt by what I said, my mom in particular because I was the one who told her to marry him but I only said that because I want her happy and he makes her happy.

I actually don't know exactly how they met. The friend who invited him is really nice and social but she has a tendency to keep inviting people who don't really care to be in the group. This will go on for a while until the new person just stops hanging out with us.

This group is really fun and I like everyone except for Tom. When I first met him, he was working a job he hated. He would just complain about it and it got old really fast. He then got a job offer elsewhere and put in his notice. He is now unemployed and the negativity is continuing. He's gotten drunk a few times at trivia and well, let's just say he's not a happy drunk.

He's now starting to invite himself when he hears me making plans with others in the group. I really don't want to be that guy who excludes others but I just don't like him. I think he's boring and a drag to be around but my other friend just can't say no to anyone.

I happen to have a contracted job as a body artist for an amusement park. The company I work for also has a caricature department, and my partner has been noodling around with the idea of applying for a position.

The thing is, neither of us know how to do caricature, but because I work with people who do, I’ve been briefed about the terminology and what constitutes as being part of this particular art style. 

Earlier today my partner FaceTimed me quite excitedly and said that they were practicing caricatures, proceeding to flip through multiple sheets of paper with sketches of people on them. 

I love their art style, I always have, and I told them that these were some amazing sketches and that they had a great likeness to who they were based off of. I did then say, however, that these were not technically caricatures. 

I said that they’re stylized portraits, which is what my coworkers have told me this style of drawing is called. I told my partner that if they were planning to apply to the job, it might be better to look more into exactly what it takes to replicate the caricature style. 

They sort of exploded at me about this, saying things like, “I already knew that!” and “I was hoping you would just say you liked them.” I was taken aback because I didn’t think I had said anything inflammatory.

I feel bad because I didn’t want to make them upset, but I still feel like what I said didn’t really warrant them getting angry at me. AITA?

My aunt’s wedding is tomorrow. I’m not a part of the wedding party, I haven’t been formally invited by her, everything has been communicated to me by my parents. I’m not too close with my aunt but want to support her. (For the record, me saying everything was communicated to me through my parents isn’t bad, just trying to give a little context)

[EDIT: I was invited, I just meant she never sent me an invite or ever talked to me about it. She told my parents, who told me. I was just trying to explain that we aren’t very close. Apologies for the bad explanation]

I asked my dad, her brother, what the colors of the wedding are and he told me blue and yellow. Coincidentally, my friend had a yellow and blue sunflower themed wedding a month ago that I bought yellow dress pants for. I wasn’t in that wedding party either, but wanted to support her as she was the first of my high school friends to have a wedding. I figured it’d be nice to get some more use out of the pants since I only bought them for the previous wedding.

My dad told me I’m not allowed to wear the yellow pants though since there will be family pictures. I thought he meant the whole suit I made for my friend’s wedding because I had a lot of sunflower stuff to go with the theme. When I told him I wouldn’t wear the sunflower stuff he said that the pants were the problem because they’re bright. https://i.imgur.com/aGlvY1C.jpg here’s a photo of said pants.

A bit of back story, P had a messy relationship with his baby mama. Basically she messed him up financially and emotionally, using the kid and the prospect of a happy ever after to get what she wanted from him (more money). It was some cruel manipulative shit and went on the past few years during which P confided in me as it all unfolded. P was not in a good way through all of this and I was going through some heavy stuff through this time too and I guess we bonded over how fucked up our lives were.

Anyway, a while back I was at a birthday party of a mutual friend, and P's ex showed up with a new boyfriend.

We decided that we wanted our two boys, who are currently 8 and 10, to be informed citizens from an early age.

We keep the radio tuned to our local NPR station in the car and make sure to watch the nightly news together each night as a family. During dinner, my husband and I discuss the major stories of the day with our kids and answer any questions they have. We're happy with the results so far.

I work for a real estate management company. The office is me, 3 other hourly employees, the CEO, the owner (CEO’s mom), the CFO, the office manager, and the CEO’s assistant. 

The office is severely underpaid. The hourly employees and myself make $12/hour (bullshit but I’m going back to school soon so whatever). The office manager and assistant make a little over $12/hour and have been there for like 5 years longer than us, so there aren’t good pay prospects.

The CEO is the type to say “there’s no money for raises, but I’ll buy the office lunch today,” or throw small birthday parties and holiday parties for the staff. Usually these just involve free food. At one Christmas party, the CEO jokingly referred to it as “our bonus.” I was PISSED.

Since then I haven’t contributed anything or participated in these little novelty events they put on for us. Christmas office lunch at a nice restaurant?

29175,"AITA for making plans to avoid going to my mom’s 4th wedding reception?. I [28M] have considered going to Ohio for Thanksgiving this year to spend it with my dad [56M] and extended family. I live in Tennessee and my dad moved back to Ohio a few years ago to be near his parents and siblings as they age, plus my sisters and I are all grown and scattered about. So I’ve seen my dad maybe 7-8 times in the last 3 years, and even though we aren’t super close, we get along and I love the old man.

We also have one big thing in common: football. I grew up watching Ohio State games with my dad every fall. We’d always grill out and have a great time, but I haven’t been able to watch a single game with him since he moved away. Because of this, and upon discovering the Ohio State-Michigan game (biggest game of the season for either team) falls on Thanksgiving weekend, I thought that would be a perfect time for my daughter [6F] and I to make a trip up.

This past Friday rolls around and my younger sister Liddy [20F] calls me to chat. I hadn’t made any decisions about Ohio at this point, just some general thoughts on the idea, but I figured she might want to go if she didn’t have any other plans. So I ask her if she’d go if I finalize plans.

Well, turns out my 3 sisters were out to dinner a few weeks ago and Abby [25F] tells the other 2 that our mom [56F] is planning to use Thanksgiving for her wedding reception with her new fiancée [~65M] because she anticipates us all being there.

This rubbed me the wrong way for a few reasons.

-She plans to commandeer a big holiday to make it about her and her marriage.

-She only told Abby and the rest of us only know because she’s spilling the beans (because Abby wasn’t told to spread this news).

-She expects us to be there without clearing it with us first. I have two kids, Abby and Liddy have serious boyfriends, and Annie [30F] is almost always traveling, so you have to let us know this type of stuff well in advance.

Those things alone are reasons for me to not want to go, but she’s also onto her 4th marriage. She has made it increasingly clear over the last year that she isn’t super seriously in love with the guy, just that he’s got acceptable qualities and she’s lonely and needs financial stability. So we never expected a reception or anything notable in the first place.

As soon as Liddy told me about this, I decided to finalize plans to go to Ohio for Thanksgiving. I was probably going to do it anyway, but the way my mom is handling this whole marriage/holiday thing, I’d rather just not be around.

Our group is very candid with each other so after a couple months of this strange change in behavior, us reaching out, asking if he was alright, we were frank and said it felt like he was making himself pretty distant. He appreciated our feedback and told us he'd make more of an effort to participate, and at least respond to us to let us know what's up and if he's okay.

After that he would only ever really respond to us when it was about some kind of mundane topic. Others in our group would share incredibly personal parts of their lives and he was noticeably absent, but someone sends a message about a new movie coming out and he'll chip in a message or two. It's not like we were going to force him to participate, the situation just ultimately created a strange tension that has caused us all to drift a bit apart.

One day he finally agreed to meet up with us and he announced he had split up with his longtime girlfriend and had already been dating someone else for a few weeks. It was such a big life change, I felt that myself and others were a little cheated because we put so much trust into our friendship and it was clear he didn't feel the same way. 

He continued not really being involved. A couple of our friends who live out of town stopped putting in effort cause Anthony never did, then it's just me and my friend Eric left. The group will occasionally chat about big life events or updates, but it is slowing down. I guess it's just the way life goes.

I haven't heard from Anthony at all in a few months and he messaged me out of the blue saying he is planning on getting engaged so he is wanting a discounted photography rate for the proposal. I feel conflicted that he'd reach out now out of the blue, when he was rejecting mine and my other friends' friendship for the past year and a half.

62734,"AITA for telling my daughter she can't use her anxiety as an excuse for everything?. I'll open this up with a trigger warning, because I get that this could be offensive or upsetting to some people.

My daughter is 16 years old and has an anxiety disorder. While I obviously cannot understand her unique experiences, I do understand what it is like to have anxiety and I try to support her as best as I can. I helped her set up appointments with therapists and doctors, and just generally try to be a good support system for her, as much as I can.

However, for the past 6 months or so, she seems to be using her anxiety as a reason/excuse why she cannot do certain things. For example, I'll ask her to help me do chores around the house and she'll say that she's feeling anxious so she can't right now. I'll ask her why she did poorly on a test, and she'll say she felt really anxious the day before and couldn't study. I sympathize with her feelings, but still, in my opinion, she has to try to push past it sometimes (easier said than done - I am absolutely aware).

The incident in question happened the other day, when my sister was in town for one night who she almost never sees. They have a great relationship generally, and my sister loves her a lot. The three of us were going to go out for dinner, when half an hour before my daughter says she is having an anxiety attack and can't come. I knew this would hurt my sister, so I told her that I understand she is struggling, but everyone has their own stuff going on and she can't keep using her anxiety as an excuse to continually avoid doing things. I tried to use some tact, but also be upfront about how I felt. Also this is after *numerous* sit-down conversations where I have tried to help her work through her anxiety.

My daughter started crying and calling me a bitch who will never understand what she's going through. I said it's true that I may not entirely understand, but that also doesn't absolve her of any and all responsibilities. She slammed her bedroom door and hasn't spoken to me since.

40913,"AITA for kicking another prof out of the classroom?. So i teach at my local university. The system works like this. We all share lecture halls in various buildings. Lectures end ten minutes before the hour and the next one starts on the hour, so the prof and students have ten minutes to leave/enter and settle in. Most of the time I will run into a prof/students just leaving and wrapping up a lecture and no big deals ensue.

This was not the case yesterday. I arrive at 10:53 ready to set up my lecture but the professor beforehand is holding an in-class midterm for her students and the lecture hall is still full. No one is getting up to hand in their papers so this means about another 5 mins of students packing up and turning in their papers. I think no biggie, I can plug my laptop into an HDMI cable in 2 minutes. But the prof continues her midterm until 10:57 by which time she is surely cutting into my lecture time. By now almost all of my class is behind me waiting to settle in. 

So i march to the front and ask her to leave to which she responds ""no thank you I dont think I will. My students are not done with their midterms""

For some reason I decided to turn to the class and tell them (ad lib): Hello everyone I am Professor Throwaway and I am sorry to inform you, you are delaying my class time. Please leave the classrooms, and discuss with your professor about submitting."" They promptly did so.

She lost it. She yelled at me saying i have no authority to which I pointed at the clock (now 11:01) saying that it was my time block and therefore I had authority. She claimed she started her exam late and it is a 50 min exam and she didnt want her students to not have less than 50 minutes. I told her to finish it in the hallway if she had to but not to take up anymore of my time. She left in a huff.

Today I had an email from my department head and apparently I am meeting with him and the other prof to ""discuss my actions in this disagreement""

So...AITA?. Am I the asshole?","YTA. I’m a university professor. I’ve been on both sides of this situation and I think you acted unreasonably. First, your class does not begin at 10:57, it begins at 11. The 10 minute transition is a courtesy. And I have occasionally waited even a few minutes beyond, to allow the other professor to wrap up, and just to be a decent person.

Second, there’s the collegiality with your fellow faculty to think about. This is an issue to raise privately and after the fact, not by humiliating one of your colleagues in front of her students.  You made yourself look like an unreasonable bully. You power-played by commandeering another professor’s class. Lots of troublesome hierarchies exist between tenured, non-tenured, and adjunct faculty. Hopefully you didn’t make them worse.

Third, what would have been the harm in starting your lecture five (or even ten) minutes late? Would students have died if you’d had to speed up, or hurry through a few slides? No part of a lecture is worth more than modeling respectful behavior for your students. The point of a university is to defer to what’s best for STUDENTS. Deal with the discourteousness later, at an administrative level.

Fourth, I don’t see where you said to her “how much time do you need? Will you be done by 11:05?” Such a question would have been respectful and set the right tone.

Fifth, if her students were taking an exam (versus yours listening to a lecture) the stakes were much higher for her students. You force-ending their class even two minutes before completion might mean some students didn’t complete questions—thus endangering their grades.

Somehow I also don’t quite believe your account of the other faculty’s reaction. I could see a “do you mind if I have a few more minutes?” It was likely a plea for sympathy that was met with aggression. Regardless, you humiliated a professor in front of her students. All of this was both unprofessional and also undiplomatic.

I'm not saying the other professor going over time was justified. But it happens, and reasonable people use conversation to resolve these things, not power plays and bullying.

EDIT: Replies are saying ""but those are the rules—end at 10:50 to allow time to transition."" Yes, agreed, the late professor messed up and went over. Not by much. One minute, by class standards. They were maybe not an AH, but at least discourteous.

However, the entire point of this Reddit is to deal with those situations where an OP abided by the rules and yet still feels like a YTA. In this case, the label is warranted I think. The OP went into the situation with overly-righteous aggression, instead of understanding. There was another way to handle this, regardless of the late professor's actions.",1,1,0,0,0
12341,"WIBTA if I asked my girlfriend to stop texting me ""K""?. I've been seeing this girl for a couple of months now and it's become pretty clear she's not a great texter.  As in, a lot of her texting feels robotic; less like a conversation between two friends (or in this case, a couple) and more like a conversation between business partners who organize meetings from time to time.  As a whole it's pretty annoying, but by far the worst part is when she texts me ""K"".  For example, I might text her that I'm on my way to pick her up for a date or whatever, and she'll respond ""K"".

I don’t understand it, people don’t do this with other foods, but apparently seafood is so magical and great that I should try it and eat it. I’ve never liked any form of seafood I’ve tried and I refuse it every time. It’s so infuriating and frustrating.

My in-laws don’t let up every time there’s seafood in the house. Once, when I was pregnant, my mother-in-law told me to “try this” and fed me lobster ravioli. This was extra frustrating because I’m fairly certain pregnant people are supposed to stay away from seafood (or at least tuna lol).

I’m just worried about being sensitive to people with allergies, because I know it can be a frustrating and potentially deadly thing. It sounds silly, but I’m just so tired of people telling me to try it. Of course my in-laws know I’m not allergic.

So yesterday my father and I went through some old electronics he had in his office, and threw most of it away, however, some things we decided to sell on the Dutch version of eBay, Marktplaats.

When he got here to pick them up I gave him the chance to see the laptops boot up so that he could have confirmation that they work, he said that it wasn't necessary and we exchanged my goods for his money. I got a little less than I hoped for but we really needed to get rid of the laptops so it was okay.

This afternoon the big twist happened, I got a message from Eric telling me that, on the laptop that already missed the f4 key, he noticed one of the mouse buttons missed a rubber piece that should've been on top, I honestly didn't notice this and apologized. Now he wants to either return that laptop or he wants me to pay him about 1/3 of the money he had given me for the complete package. I think this is unfair for he had a chance to look at the laptops before taking them with him, and he already got a great price anyway.

31571,"WIBTA if I tell my wife to keep a life changing amount of money?. TL;DR: Wife's ex gifted her a life changing amount of money to stay near her support system after they broke up.  We no longer 'need' it and she wants to give it back, I was given the opportunity to tell her to keep it and I'm conflicted if I'd be the asshole to tell her to get over herself and keep it.

&#x200B;

Some backstory.  My wife and I are a fairly new couple, we've only married a few months.  Previously, she was engaged to someone who is well off and her life took a different course and they ended things.  During the course of the relationship he took opportunities away from my wife to provide stability for her daughter things like telling her that if she secured low income housing their relationship was over and that he would provide for her.

&#x200B;

Where does the money come in?  After their relationship was over she saw him one last time and explained to him that because of his promise to take care of her and her daughter and passing up on opportunities to do so herself for him that he should provide them with stability in his absence.  Enter the life changing amount of money, gifted to her to keep her near family and her support system.  She then went on to buy a place, no mortgage, owned outright.  Unfortunately that place didn't work out for a number of reasons and now she's selling it for a loss.

&#x200B;

Since then we fell in love and got married.  I make ok money and we don't need it immediately but we've talked at length about how we'd use the proceeds of the sale of her place to positively affect our family's lives.  She's brought up in the past about giving the money back but we both agreed at the time we could use it to live mortgage free indefinitely wherever we'd like but we'd stay at the same schools to give our daughter consistency and eventually use the money down the road to pay for costly medical care she's going to need when she's 16-18.  Last night we had another discussion about it and she's insistent about giving the money back and she offered me the final word to tell her to get over it and keep the money.  I've been uncertain about it even being a topic I should weigh in on more than my opinion.  I want to tell her we should keep it when her place sells but I also want to respect her feelings towards the money.  WIBTA if I exercised the offer and told her to keep the money?  


Edit: Wife's ex isn't the baby daddy.. Am I the asshole?",NAH. Put it in a trust or college account for her daughter if you don't need it to live comfortably.

45179,"WIBTA for excluding my aunt and her kids from my wedding?. My fiance and I have been together since college. He proposed and before we could start planning for our wedding I found out I was pregnant, so we postponed the wedding. 

Life kind of got in the way of the wedding, and 5 kids and 17 years later we are finally in a place where a wedding is possible finacially/time wise for us. I have always just referred to my fiance as my husband, but now we can finally make it official. 

Now to where I may be the asshole. My aunt and her kids have never gotten along with me. My aunt was horrible to me as a child, because my mom was quite poor and she married rich. She used to accuse me of stealing her kids things and would overall treat me like dirt, because her daughters were ""just better"" than me and my sister. 

I would be willing to look past this if it werent for the fact that she is an abusive manipulator as well. My mom took several of her dogs away from her because she was so abusive to them. My mom would rehabilitate and then rehome them where they would finally be loved. It finally came to a point where my mom said she would call the cops if my aunt got anymore dogs. I was only about 10 when that happened, but I still cant get that out of my mind when I think about her. 

Her kids arent any better. My cousins are spoiled to all hell and the few times theyve met my kids theyve been just awful to them. One in particular would pull my daughter's hair if she was too loud or silly (she's only 10 now probably about 6 when this happened) 

I want to exclude them from my wedding. My whole extended family will be there and they told me that I need to get over it. My aunt is a ""changed woman"" and wants to finally see me married.

So a new shopping center opened up around the corner and it has lead to people always parking on our block. All of us that live here can hardly ever find street parking.

So I went around to our neighbors getting them to sign a petition to make our street permit parking only.

It was a pretty hellish process as the city people weren’t on our side at all and kept denying our request even though we got a majority of our neighbors to agree.

Turned out though that most of the neighbors on our street that didn’t agree were further away from the shopping center. So they didn’t have as big an issue with it as the cars parked more evenly down the rest of their street. They also didn’t want to make parking harder for their friends.

But on our block the one closest to the shopping center the amount of people wanting the permit parking was unanimous. 

We decided to put the petition in just for our block and the city officials agreed right away because they wouldn’t be losing too much city parking.

All our neighbors on our block are super happy because we all have plenty of parking for ourselves now and have guest permits for our friends.

The rest of the street is pretty upset though as more people just park farther down the street near their houses making it very crowded.

Since that’s been happening they’ve tried to get permit parking too, but the city won’t approve it because they need to have a certain amount of city parking and can’t get rid of anymore.

The people who didn’t sign the first petition are pissed the problem got pushed to them and the people who signed our first petition are pissed because they got pushed out of the agreement they wanted.

Background: I’m a really awkward college freshman taking a Portuguese for Spanish speakers class. The two languages are really similar and people who’ve been exposed to Spanish (or pretty much any Romance language) usually pick it up faster. The professor is really great and the activities she makes us do are really fun. But I suck at socializing. I freeze up, I get nervous, I stumble and I piss people off. This one girl in particular 

I’ve had about two interactions with this girl. I don’t know her name, or a whole lot about her, but she has a bit of an attitude: an “I don’t want to be here bc I’m too advanced” kind of attitude. When she introduced herself to the class on the first day she mentioned something about how she had to be placed in this class bc this was the “introduction” course and not the “advanced” course. (Something along those lines, I can’t remember it verbatim.)

On the first day, the professor gave us introductory sentences ( “Eu me chamo ___ . Como te/você se chama/s?” ) to use and introduce ourselves to other students. The girl walks up to me and uses a different sentence than the one we were supposed to use ( “Meu nome é ___. Eu sou [transfer student/second year student idk]. Como é você nome?” ) I was really confused and I didn’t know how to respond bc I couldn’t hear her and I didn’t really understand what she was saying right off the bat. She kept trying to rush an answer out of me and I told her, “Dame un momento para responder, por favor (give me a moment to respond, please).” She made a face and I stumbled out a response and walked away. I didn’t want to speak to her anymore than I had to.

The second encounter I had with her happened today and the same thing happened. We were practicing interviews and she walked up to me with a very bored “I don’t wanna be here look” and told be to hurry up and ask her a question. I told her in English, “give me a minute, let me pick one.” I asked my question, she answered; she asked her question, I answered. We went our separate ways. 

She always looks really tired and bored in class, so I’m thinking maybe she works a lot to pay for college and doesn’t get enough rest, so that’s why she has a bit of an attitude? Idk, I don’t think I should’ve been harsh with her. AITA?

64144,"AITA for slamming my front door in the morning to wake my neighbours up?. So backstory, I live in a house that's been converted into 2 apartments. I currently live in the top apartment, I have my own access to the property so I don't have to bother anyone when I'm coming home from work late or getting up early.

I moved into this place a few months back and at the start things were great, I talked with my neighbours and they seemed like nice people. However a week after moving in the partying began, I'm talking a party every 2-3 days. At first I just let them do it because I didn't want them to think bad of me early on and I thought maybe it's because it's summer and it'll stop after a week, it didn't.

A few weeks after that I changed roles at my job and that meant I had to start work at 6am. So every morning I would get up and go to work as I normally would. It only took a few days for them to come knock on my door and imo with an attitude tell me to stop slamming my door in the morning because it was waking them up. At first I was sympathetic and even though they didn't ask me nicely I agreed to be a bit quieter closing the door but I also explained that their partying until 5am was keeping me up and if they could keep the noise down, they agreed.

Apparently they didn't give a shit and still continued to party. Now I want to make clear I don't give a shit if you party, everyone does but no need to be playing loud music until no hours and keep your neighbours up. So I confronted them again and explained I have work early and I would really appreciate it if they could keep it down, again they didn't.

I said fuck it I'm going to purposely slam my door every fucking morning until they stop. Not surprisingly it only took 2 days of me slamming my door for them to get angry and once again come to my door acting like I was in the wrong. The argument got heated this time but I made my point very clear to them ""keep the music down or at least after 12am or I'll keep doing it"" and then I slammed my door in their face.

Since then we've been in a long going feud with eachother and honestly it's kind of died down a bit now. We still hate eachother and we both still think the other is wrong. I don't see an issue with what I did, it was in retaliation. Am I the asshole?","This is the clearest Esh I've seen on the sub so far.

72130,"WIBTA if I put a pentagram on a coworker's gift?. I work for a fairly small (less than 200 people I'd wager) company and closely with about a dozen people. Every year for Christmas my smaller team hangs stockings with everybody's name on it and our boss will fill it with treats leading up to Christmas day, and it's traditional for everyone to put something small in them for everyone as well (like someone usually does lip balm, travel size lotions, hand sanitizer, etc.). This year I have found reusable water bottles for everyone and am in the process of adding customizations to each of them. I've got things like swapping the A at the start of a huge Marvel fan's name with the A from the Avengers, the zodiac constellation for another person (who is really into that stuff) under their name, the word for ""grandma"" in the native language of a newly made grandma (who is so happy about it too), etc. 

I was discussing this with a coworker and she asked what I was doing for a particular person, who doesn't really get on great with the rest of us. She is the newest member of the team (came on just after last Christmas), so less involved than the rest of us who have gotten really close (a few came on over the last 2 years but most of us have been together for nearly 5 years). Nobody knows much about her, which is fine and seems to be how she likes it. From what I can tell she is a fairly cynical/dark humored person like me, but other than that I don't know much about her hobbies or interests. I'm not extremely interested in investing a lot of time to figure it out mind you... I don't really take issue with her, I just don't feel the need to be anything more than a cordial coworker.

The plan I'd made was to replace the letter 'o' in her name with a pentagram, which she has tattooed on her chest/clavical (like 8-10 inch diameter so not discrete by any means). My other coworker told me that would be inappropriate... I thought maybe but, could you be offended by something that you clearly like or believe in enough to have tattooed on yourself? And I can't really see how anybody else would be offended either. She recanted later when I mentioned an alternative idea (the moon phases- random choice tbh but the best I could do) and said to do just the pentagram.

Is there something I'm missing though? WIBTA for doing this?. Am I the asshole?","NTA. If they have it tattooed on them, they’ll probably appreciate that you noticed! If not, explain your thought process to them when they question it.",0,0,0,0,1
37038,"AITA for treating small children like dogs?. 
I always had dogs and Im even a foster home for dogs looking for a permanent home. I also never had kids.

A few days ago, my cousin asked me to take care of her 3 small children for the day because she needed to run some not-kid-friendly errands and the sitter cancelled on her. I agreed because, how hard can it be?

Very hard turns out. Especially when you have little to no experience with small children.

So, I kinda thought ""what would I do if I had 3 puppies in my hands?"" and did that. Basically giving treats for doing as told, playing with them to make them tired, teaching them dog tricks to make them busy (they got treats for that too), I even made an obstacle course out of toys, tents etc and 2 of them were competing for the best dog award. They loved being dogs! And it gave me time to take care of the youngest one (almost 1 year old) without fearing the other two will break something or themselves.

All was well, the day was over. Except I got a call, 2 days later, that the kids still act like dogs, especially whenever something reminds them of the game, including trying to chase a stray cat that they saw while walking to the playground with their mom and barking at other dogs and even other kids. Dont get me wrong, my cousin isnt mad at me or blaming me, but she did seem ultra tired because they wont stop playing the game and I feel guilty for starting all this.

I’m a senior in high school, and there’s a guy in my grade that is special needs. I believe he either has Aspergers or Autism. Whatever he has, he doesn’t exactly understand what is socially acceptable and what isn’t. I’ve had to be in classes with him every year of my high school career, save for the current year. In every class he asks non topical questions, and interrupts both the teacher and other students. He also is bordering on stalker levels of infatuation with every popular girl in school, going as far as to threaten guys who he mistakenly thought that his girl of the month was dating. Nearly every girl in our grade feels uncomfortable around him, as well as many girls that were in grades above us. On top of all of this he is extremely bigoted, going as far as to say women do not deserve rights and that gays should be killed. This year I finally broke, no longer able to even be polite around him. I’ve nearly snapped and gone off on him multiple times, but have managed to leave the room before I did this. I’ve talked about this with multiple friends, and they think that I’m being an AH because he’s special needs and “doesn’t know any better.” Just to reiterate,

But I live in an apartment in a big city, and I'm gone a minimum of 10hrs a day, sometimes more like 14.  My wife is also gone anywhere from 10-14 hours a day.  

I would do a dog Walker, but my wife wouldn't put up with that expense.

Yet, somehow, when she says ""cant we get a dog?"" And I point out all of these roadblocks, I'm the asshole.  Like, no, we can not get a dog.  You know why the fuck we cannot get a dog.

And it's my wife who wants to live in the city.  I'd love to be in a house in the burbs, closer to work and with a yard for a dog.  

I'm not upset that we cant have a dog.  I'm upset for two reasons - first, I dont like having to say ""no"" all the time.

Back when my ex-best friend and I still talked, I gave her a jacket that has my last name on it as a birthday present. It's a soccer jacket from when I played, which is why it had my name on it. It was a gag gift that stemmed from me lending it to her once, and her parents asking her if it was a boyfriend's jacket.

My roommate saw me washing her dishes a couple times and was shocked and appalled; she kept saying ""You don't have to do that. Those are my dishes."" So I backed off and gave her a longer window (2-3 days) to wash her own dishes before I did it myself. 

Recently, we had an argument where she accused me of only cleaning my space and never helping with the rest of the apartment. This is a blatant lie and she knows it so I started guerrilla cleaning our kitchen. When she cooks, she makes a huge mess and won't pick up after herself for several days.

He became an atheist at about age 16, and when we met at age 18, his church attendance was spotty. I wound up dragging him out of bed on Sunday mornings and meeting him at home to drive to church together; not because I was religious (I was sort of ambiguous and still believed in souls and karma and whatnot), but because I wanted one more excuse to spend time with him, as well as trying evangelical church out in case I was simply bored of Catholic church.

Fast forward a couple years later, my husband and I spent a lot of time talking about religion, morality, faith, the paranormal, etc. He convinced me that there's nothing wrong with calling oneself an atheist, but still chose to keep it a secret from his evangelical parents, whom my husband swore would disown him.

I guess word got out that I was an atheist (but not my husband...probably because I was slightly less careful than he'd grown up to be). His mother has spent the last 10 years or so being passive aggressive to me, praising my husband for ""bringing me to church"" - which was actually my idea, telling me the day after we were engaged that I was ""very lucky to have such a godly husband."" 

She's apparently still under the impression that I came into her son's life and turned him into an atheist, when it's actually the reverse that's more true.

She was there to play house with your husband and pretend that your baby was theirs together.  All of this together is the kind of thing that restraining orders were made for. Keep that in mind if things escalate.  He's going to have to her firm and cut off all contact.  And give a heads up to family and friends she might contact.

As a mom myself to a 15 month old, I got sick to my stomach imagining the stories of beggars who give their children drugs to sleep so they can illicit sympathy from passerbys. 

I called the police, which Greeks don’t typically do. I told them where she was and that she had a limp child in her arms and I was worried about his wellbeing. All they told me was thank you for bringing this to our attention and hung up. I assume they probably didn’t do anything about it, and I didn’t stick around to see.

This conversation was on snapchat, so I wont be able to recall exactly what was said and no screenshots.

A bit of background: I met this girl on tinder. We hit it off, and she told me she was 17 not 18, but her birthday was on halloween. I told her I like her but im not gonna do any attempt at romance until shes 18 (im 20). I tell here she has no obligation to me though and can continue looking. She has Bipolar 2.

We quickly become 'good' friends, and she doesnt have many people to talk to and she has episodes sometimes. She'll call me crying and ill comfort her. I sympathize with her because i used to bee in the exact same spot at her age.

Flash forward to 2 days ago, she tells me shes gotten back with her ex, but she wants to be friends. Im totally cool with this, as she had no obligation.

But, I tell her something along the lines of 'just be careful, usually when breaking up for a problem its still present when getting back together'

and she flips the fuck out. ""my relationship is none of your business"" and at this point im just trying to defend myself. I've never brought up my age as vantage or anything, but in the conflict after saying the intial advice i said 'trust me i learned the hard way after getting back with my ex' and she blows up again saying 'your ex isn't my ex'. I run my mouth off too much, but I don't throw any insults, just me trying to shed some light on how I was trying to give advice. I ultimately closed with 'emotions can cloud anyones judgement to where they dont notice red flags or they look past it, just be aware in the moment'. I really value my self image, so i was more focused on trying to rephrase myself to where I dont look like im trying to get into someone elses business. 'dont treat me like a child' even though I reinforce the fact that she can make her own decisions. She tells me 'friends dont get in anothers business like that'.

To clarify, i never said 'thats a bad idea' or 'you were supposed to be with me' or 'break up with him'. None of that. Merely was trying to say 'be careful'. But she ends up blocking me after saying that im just a smartass who thinks he knows everything.

My girlfriend is sort of on the outside of my group of friends. She's not really close with them, but they all know her and are sort of on the level of ""acquaintance"". She's been wanting to get closer with them as she wants to be able to hang out with everybody without having me as a sort of proxy. One of the ways she thought she could get closer was to host a movie night at her house.

We mention this in a group chat a few weeks ago, and everyone seems on board to do the movie night. We as a group settle on the date of August 3rd. Last week, me and my girlfriend made a Facebook group chat to help organize better than on WhatsApp (using polls and what not) for stuff like how much food we need to make and to make an official plan (because Messenger has those event features etc). No one responds until we constantly message asking who is for sure coming. This happens on the Sunday before the event is supposed to happen. We urge people to RSVP, and people come back with ""might be able to come"" and ""unsure if I can come"" and responses like that. Out of 15 people, only 2 people confirmed they could go. 4 people clicked ""maybe"" and the rest didn't respond at all besides clicking the option for ""No"".

This crushed her. I wanted to urge her and say we could still do a movie night with me, her, and the two who could go, but she doesn't want to put effort into a get together if no one seems that interested. (She was going to turn her living room into a sort of mattress area with pillows and blankets, and get snacks for everybody) She's decided to cancel the event.

Normally, I'd just write it off as people being busy and I understand that. No one is obligated to go anywhere, but we had all settled on a date weeks ago so I don't think it's a matter of people already having plans or being busy, but rather them forgetting and being careless.

She got excited when people said they were free and were able to go a few weeks ago, and it disappointed her to find out that they couldn't take the time to respond to her event invite until days before the event, with most of the responses being half-hearted ""maybes"" or flat out ""no's"".

I'm wondering if my anger is rightfully placed.

I (21M) worked for my father at his boat marina for the back half of the summer and the fall. Every year at the end of the season we have a company dinner where he gives his employees a Christmas bonus. We were on thanksgiving vacation a week prior to that. While we were there, I showed my dad a $200 racing wheel and pedals set for my computer and jokingly said that I wanted that for Christmas from him.

I’d also been mentioning to him all week that I wanted to buy it at some point. He never mentioned the bonus at all again during that. My wheel arrived today, I set it up, and excitedly sent him a picture. That was my biggest mistake. He called me almost instantly, furious. He said that him and my stepmom bought me that wheel, and they were pissed because now they had to return it. He called me selfish, and he berated me for buying a gift so close to Christmas.

38555,"WIBTA for RSVPing no to a memorial service because my plans might change?. My neighbor John’s wife died after a long battle with an illness. The funeral was private with just family and we were told that a memorial service was supposed to be held at a later date. 

Yesterday, a friend and neighbor of John’s, named Tim, emailed quite a few of us, mentioning when the memorial service is, and that John wanted to get an idea of how big of a room to reserve at the funeral home. Tim told us to let him know within a couple of days if we would be attending the service or not so John could reserve a room.

While my schedule is currently open for the date of the service, I don’t really want to agree to go to the service in case something comes up. I would feel like an ass if I said, “Yes, I am attending” and then not show up to a memorial service because I got called into work or needed to take care of something family related. Considering this is a delicate situation, I feel it needs to be handled with the utmost care.

I’ve never had to RSVP to a service before but I need to state now if I am coming or not. I’ve just shown up and if people have had to stand for the service because the room is too small, that’s what they did. I want to reply that I won’t be attending, and of course not say why, because I think I will feel worse if I say yes now and back out in four weeks. It seems like they should just guess how many people are coming and not ask people to RSVP because it will put pressure on people to come, in fear of looking like an ass.

He's been collecting unemployment for some time now.  So, when he was diagnosed with cancer she had to take FMLA which ate up her PTO.  They started a go fund me page to help with bills and got I think approximately $500.  I decided to give her $600 no strings attached.  

She texted me one day saying work had fucked up her check so her check was almost nothing.  I asked what happened to the go fund me money and she say that it was gone and they were still waiting on her husband's disability to go through.  I asked if she needed a loan and she said if I could she would appreciate it and asked for another $600.

We talk about her leaving him and trying us, but that ended up going nowhere. I drop it all, knowing this could cause harm to our friend group.

&#x200B;

A month passes, and she was giving me a ride home from a party at a friends house. Once we get to my house, she tells me she wants me. She says shes been thinking about ""it"" all weekend. I tell her i'm not doing anything with her if she is still with her boyfriend. She explains that its not that easy, and we talk for close to an hour. This ends up with us talking in circles, she leaves and i figure that's the end of the night. A hour or two later, i hear my doorbell. Its her. She tells me she did it, she broke up with him. So I let her in.

Laying in bed afterwards she confesses she lied. That she didn't break it off. At that point i'm surprised, but not mad at her. We talk it through, how i wont tell anyone what happened and neither will she.  


Today, months after we hooked up, the group is in a uproar. They found out that her boyfriend cheated on her. Now everyone thinks hes an asshole, they kick him out of the group. They all start ripping him apart, and pretty much shit on his life. All the meanwhile i'm sitting there knowing what she did first. 

AITA for pursing anything with her to begin with? Is she the asshole for playing innocent? Should i keep what her and I did a secret? Are they assholes for jumping ship on him, after defending him to my criticisms?

24570,"AITA for Telling My Friend a Guy Tweeted About their “Relationship”?. To summarize this so it’s not a 3 year grad program, I have (had?) two friends, Andreas and Mel who I thought were very similar personalities so I introduced them to be friends. Not even a week later Andreas tells me he is probably in love with Mel. Mel has a much more reserved personality, to the point that I’m uncomfortable posting this but I’m not using her actual name so I should be ok. This was caused by an incident in high school that was extremely traumatic. 

Andreas and Mel’s “friendship” (Andreas says it was more, Mel said it wasn’t) fell apart when Andreas told Mel his true feelings a few months later and she rejected him. This began the social media parade of him moping and begging for her attention (without using her name) which we all explained to him that it’s emotionally manipulative to post that knowing she would see it. Well she did, and she cut him off. He would continue emotionally posting on social media without using her name until this month. 

So this month, he started posting on twitter again about my friend (saying that they were going to hang out in person and he was going to tell her how he felt because he knew it we different this time) using her nickname so I wasn’t going to say anything, until I realized he had posted tweet after tweet detailing the times the hung out (place, time, actions, inactions, like a episode of a teen drama) and with her and my real names. Andreas’ Twitter is completely public and multiple coworkers know and follow him including myself. Mel also knows about his Twitter, but does not have an account and was not monitoring it since she had cut him off. 

So after asking Mel and I’s mutual friend, I told Mel, who told me not to say anything to him because he was “in pain” and I didn’t. The next morning I wake up to an angry text from Andreas saying “Hey, it would be great that what I post on my social media you don’t go around telling people.. “ which I didn’t respond to. But then when I come into work, coworkers are telling me he’s going around telling everyone I ruined things between him and Mel because he was going to tell her how he felt in person. 

I’m considering if I’m an asshole for introducing them in the first place to expose Mel to this nonsense. Andreas seemed like a normal person, but his almost obsessive nature over Mel is just not ok. I know Andreas thinks I’m an asshole for telling her, but he must have known that this would be a huge deal to Mel (but he didn’t know she knew his Twitter (and exposed me to it before he even mentioned it) already). 

So reddit, AITA?. Am I the asshole?","NTA. 
Being a friend means telling your friends they might not want to heat even if it risks losing that friend. And your male friend needs to know what he is doing is creepy, manipulative and is in no way going to get your female friend to like him back. He needs to be told to move on and not make these very public post about her again. No one is entitled to like someone back just because they like them. In all honestly if I was you, I would cut ties with the creep. But I do see the value in staying in his life to hold him accountable for his own actions. 

Mel had every right to know what he was posting. You do hold some accountability for introducing them. So I think your loyalty should be with Mel. What he is doing is very obessive and concerning. She needs to be able to protect herself from him in case he tries to escalate things outside of social media and knowing about these post could help her file a police report later.",0,0,0,0,1
48555,"AITA for ending a friendship without communicating why?. Me (24M) and my girlfriend (24F) have been seeing each other for almost a year and were very close friends before that. We met through a mutual friend, John, who I know as the boyfriend of one of my college friends, Meg. That couple has been a part of our social circle for a very long time, but they’re not quite our best or closest friends — we see them maybe once a month. 

Within the last year or so, my girlfriend and I have had a few issues with Meg’s behavior. They’ve said multiple insensitive things about our professional lives, how much money we make, or what we do with our time and have made us uncomfortable. They have a very loud personality that we think comes off more and more self-centered as time goes on. And in our opinion, they treat John, who we care about, like crap. We had one big dramatic interaction where my girlfriend basically reached out to say “hey, do you feel valued and respected?” And it went very, very poorly with zero productive discussion and lots of blaming and vitriol. 

Based on our preexisting feelings and the results of our last conversation with all of them, we opted to take a huge step back from Meg. We still have been hanging out with John infrequently but definitely made no efforts to make our feelings known. It mostly just looked like us avoiding situations where we knew Meg would be present. 

However, the other night my girlfriend was basically backed into a corner and rather than lie, confessed to the John how we’ve been feeling. He’s hurt, and he told Meg how we feel about her, so she’s hurt and basically nobody is happy. We’re trying to explain that none of this was decided emotionally or nefariously, that we’re just trying to put our time and energy into the people we enjoy being around and who treat us well, but obviously that’s hard to swallow.

78326,"WIBTA for restarting a ""club"" without letting the other ""co-founder"" take part?. So... After my ex and I broke up, I started taking to this girl (C) from my past. At some point, C asked me if I was interested in building a ""go cart"" to go racing and my answer was yes.

And so, we started building these cars. We did it for 3 years and for 2/3 years it was just the two of us building a car together and, for the most part, everything was a 50/50 split. (The third year there was another friend but he was really only half involved.)

We took a hiatus because 1) we both started taking college classes again and 2) I was super uneasy about where my relationship with C was standing. (The mixed signals were hitting me like a truck, but anytime I asked what was up I'd get friendzoned so I needed some space to breath... but that's a story for another time.)

Even with the space, I wasn't able to deal with the feelings that had developed until she finally told that she had been seeing someone for ~5 months later last year (was told in August). This broke my heart, and to this day, I'm still having difficulty interacting with her in person. (We work at the same place, so it's unavoidable sometimes.)

So now the dilemma.....

The go cart things was some of the dumbest fun I ever had, and I've made some new friends since shit kinda just the fan with C and I. I've talked about starting things up with this new friend group and they're all on board with it.

At some point, during some random conversation, C also mentioned that she was interested in starting the go cart thing again.

I wholly agree that starting things up without even talking to C would be a dick move.... But, I want to start this thing up again, without C being involved. Does that make me an asshole?. Am I the asshole?","NTA

It's Monday night, a school night. School night bedtime has been 8:30 pm since 6th grade (11). Was 8pm since 4th grade. 7:30pm K-4. Not super strict if you ask me. We even allow 10-10:30ish on the weekends.

Anyways, I am getting ready for bed and see my 12 year old on Fornite mid game at 10:10pm. I message him and he immediately logs out. Send him an IM of giant shit pile from Jurassic Park .Gif and he says I woke him up and mom was playing the game and that it was pretty random that she logged out right after I messaged. Says GN.

Next day I ask mom how shes digging Fortnite. Says she doesn't play. Fill her in on prior evening. Tell her if she allowed it, that's a different conversation, but I'm taking his PC access away at my place for lying. He knows my expectations and I feel he was taking advantage of his mother. He knows better and we've had complaints from his teachers for sleeping during class and such. Over my way we are religious with our children's bed time during the school year.

Long story longer, Mom writes back that she can explain from her POV later. I get a message later saying she didn't know what he said to me.

She does this stuff from time to time, insinuating I shouldn't punish for things that happen under her watch. She often tries to cover for him since I am a big meany he follows threw on punishments. She even apologizes to him when I pick him up and he's had something taken away.  I'm never super heavy, I never throw out a punishment we as a household can't/won't stick too.

So about a year ago my wife’s sister found out that she couldn’t carry a child to term due to various medical complications. Because of this, she wants my wife to carry her and her husband’s child because she cannot. This makes me extremely uncomfortable for various reasons, and is a deal breaker for me and told her I would consider ending the relationship if she went through with it. Not only would I be with my wife for the entire nine months of the pregnancy, but I fear that my wife will also have an attachment to another family’s child in the process. 

I would assume that her sisters friends would be willing to carry the child, but we haven’t asked yet. There are likely other options other than my wife carrying her sisters child to term, and my wife feels that I’m being unreasonable for not wanting her to carry her sister and husband’s child.

I am just so confused. Me, my bf and a friend (they/them) planned to go to a big convention together. I went alone the last four years, now they want to join me. 

I organized the tickets and asked them in march to find a cheap place to stay at during the trip, since we are going to spend a few days at the con. However, none of them made even the slightest effort to do this. It's a big con, hotels are either expensive or dont have any vacant rooms months prior to the con. You have to be fast and to book early.

Fast forward to yesterday. I asked them how things are going. They told me they found one place for 1800€. I told them I couldnt afford this even the slightest and if that was the cheapest? They said they didnt find anything else. 

So I got up and did a quick Airbnb research. I messaged two hosts. And today I got an answer from one of them, stating we could spend our days there. I was happy and told both my bf and our friend about my success in finding something. 

Well, they werent happy. Not happy at all. They were super angry at me, saying I wouldnt trust them to find a place to stay. They said I shouldnt have done this and instead should have let them do the searching instead.

She later apologised and I said ""this is not the first time you've done it"" and she said ""no, this is the second"", to which I responded ""well that doesn't sound particularly apologetic"". Cue a few minutes when the food came and we ate in silence, which got me pretty annoyed since I was the one that was called an idiot in public. We were supposed to watch a movie afterwards and she still didn't want to talk so I said I'd walk home instead if she's upset (she drove) and walked out. Later when we talked she then said that she felt embarassed herself since the waitress and I were making a scene over getting the order right and she tried to diffuse it by ""affectionately"" calling me an idiot.

I've never taken public humiliation well and I feel like I could've taken it better but the tone she used when calling me an idiot, and what I've been through in terms of work has made me particularly sensitive to being called an idiot (she knows about this) so I'm here wonder AITA for reacting the way I did..

66404,"WIBTA if I asked my friend for money back that she owes me before replacing her car. I have been living with my roommate and her young child for the last 18 months. We've been friends for over 20 years and helped each other out of bad relationships. 

When we first left our relationships, we had nothing. I had to give up my car because it was in his company's name. We were living in a homeless shelter. Not having a car was a problem, because I drive for a living. 
So my friend says I can use her car for the time being. Great. 

We look for an apartment, and had agreed to get a 2 bedroom to save money. Her and the kid can share a room, split the rent 50/50. But then she changes her mind and says we should get a 3 bedroom, so we don't outgrow it. She says she'll pay the difference in rent, so this is fine by me. 
We find the perfect apartment and she doesn't have her portion of first and lasts deposit. So I pay it. She says she'll pay me back. 

I'm making good money at my job, and she's on assistance, so I want to help and I pay the rent for the first summer. Then Sept-Dec I pay 75%. Then starting in January we're each paying half. 
Now in Feb that car dies. So I buy a new one. Keep in mind, this car was purchased 4 years prior for 2 grand. It owed us nothing. 

Now she has decided that she wants the car. She wants to drive to school that's 3 blocks away, and drop her kid off at school that I can literally see from the porch of the apartment. So I'm expected to buy another car. 

I don't really care about all the extra rent I paid, I wanted to help her out, but WIBTA if I asked her to pay me back for her half of the rent deposit, and tell her she has to pay the agreed upon extra rent before replacing the car? I feel like she's taking advantage, and I'm the sucker for not speaking up sooner.. Am I the asshole?","NTA

I’m not in the business of policing relationships.....but because I had known these two for a long time and I knew their personalities I KNEW it was a bad idea for them to date. And everyone else knew that too. But they dated anyway.

It was a mess from start to finish and for the 3 months was a living hell for me hearing both sides of this shitty relationship. It ended in tears and cheating and screaming...for all of which I was positioned in the middle of. 

Anyway, they broke up and for a long time I could no longer hang out with them. They eventually became friends enough to hang with me together and they also found better significant others that matched their personalities.

I like hanging out with them and as friends they get along so much better. A lot of times I actually forget that they dated for a time and they end up coming over to hang out with me in overlapping times.

For senior prom, all the girls had a Facebook page where we could all show off our dresses prior the date and make sure no one had the same one. I struggle finding dresses that fit me well and anything I really like. When I went shopping, I finally found a really nice, white dress. I put it on the page while shopping and a bunch of people said “This is the same dress as Kelly\*” (not her real name). I am not friends with Kelly, but we’re also not enemies or anything. I saw her dress and it was the same dress, but a different color (hers was pink). I messaged her on FB and she asked that I not get my dress, because she spent so long looking for hers and she wanted to feel unique. We went to a small school so the odds of anyone else having the dress were going to be low. So, at first, I said okay. But the more I looked, the more I really couldn’t find a dress that I really loved. I kept thinking of that dress. So, I ended up buying it but not saying anything. I just told some very close friends that I was getting the dress in question.

Come prom night, I show up. Kelly doesn’t seem me at first, but one of her friends does and screams “Kelly!!!” She turns around, sees me and makes this angry face, but doesn’t say anything to me for the rest of the night. A lot of people said they were proud of me for not listening to Kelly, because she shouldn’t get to dictate what I wore. Especially as we weren’t friends or anything and it really didn’t matter. I had a really fun time at prom and there was no drama.

However, even after graduation, Kelly is still pissed about it. I ran into her recently and she was ice cold. Like I said, we were never friends, but we were at least cordial prior to this. However, she acts like it’s an ultimate betrayal. My friend, who is friends with one of her friends says, that Kelly feels I ruined her prom.

I always had a crush on a girl in my old high school, for the sake of anonymity let's call her Jane. I always fantasized about Jane but never really had the courage to talk to her, she was in many of my classes and I still never talked to her. At the end of last year I decide to just finally message her over text and found out that she is going to the same university as me, we texted for a long time and eventually started meeting in person once the university semester started. We got along so well it's unbelievable that we were not best friends in high school, I've never gotten along with someone better in my whole life, we never run out of topics to talk about and the conversation is always interesting. All of this happening so fast made me very excited until I found out that she was already seeing someone. She told me she is in a long distance relationship with a guy in another country and that they'd been dating for 3 years.  At the start, hearing this news did not bother me, we got along so well that I was happy being friends with her - although, I did still have feelings for her.  I loved spending time and hanging out with her.  We spent ever single moment of free time we had during university with each other. Eventually the topic of crushes was brought up and I did admit that I had feelings for her. She told me that she also shared these feelings and at this point our relationship started to become more romantic. We started doing small things such as holding hands but it quickly over a few weeks progressed to making out and sleeping with each other (not sex just cuddling and sleeping next to one another).  Problem is that while all of this is happening Jane always tells me how horrible she feels for doing this and how it makes her feel like a liar and cheater to her boyfriend, it even brings her to tears sometimes. I love her with all my heart and she's expressed that she loves me too but I can't help but feel that I am the root issue of her pain and suffering. I'm not always the one making the moves, she gave me the first kiss and was the first to many other things, this relationship is two ways, its not just me making move on her and forcing myself on her.

The standard operating procedure (SOP) had us write down the time of the harvest at the time we started the harvest.  Another coworker ""M"" happened to notice this and corrected us telling us that we are actually supposed to write down the time the harvest is complete.  M has been at the company for over a year and is the most senior person on the team (but not in a leadership position) and I have been appreciative of all the advice and guidance he has given me.  Without trying to start a fight, I explained to him why we wrote down the time we did and reference the SOP.  He explained that the SOP is sometimes not 100 percent accurate or

76238,"WIBTA For Not Going To My Sister's 21st Birthday Party. So my sister is turning 21 this year. In my culture this is not a big deal as our drinking age is 18 (UK).

This year at the end of her birthday month my parents are throwing a large party and have rented a room in a fancy restaurant for family, their friends and my sister's friends to celebrate her birthday. 

A lot of her friends are flying out to where my parents live and will be staying in my parents house for the party

I was considering going at one point but only if my partner could go with me as I am not good with big gatherings of people, particularly if I do not know 90% of the people there. 

We live in a different country where flights are expensive, and my partner is not able to get time off for us to fly earlier. The dates we could fly would not be cheap and there's no guarantee my partner could even get to the airport in time after work finishes to make the flight. So essentially he will not be able to go with me.

My sister always has parties for her birthdays whether it is just her and a large group of friends going out clubbing, or having house parties with her school friends. I do understand she has not had one like this at a fancy restaurant with this many people before.

However, I really don't think it's worth it to spend a lot of money to travel to stay at my parents house for what would be about 2 nights surrounded by people I have never met before without my partner.

I have already kinda floated this feeling around my parents and I think my mum understands on some level, my dad however cannot believe I would not go to my sister's 12st birthday and its not like I wouldn't know people because I know my parents and their friends.

So my older brother(29) and I(17) have always had problems. He's always been mean to me and doesn't seem to care about my well being like he does our sister(19). We both live with our mother(54). My mom had gained custody of me 2 years ago. I brought my stuff and I had a Keurig. He really likes coffee, so I let him use it under the condition that he cleans it just enough that it doesn't get disgusting. I rarely use and when I do I use it for hot water, which is another reason why I'm not sure if I'm being the asshole or not. He had been using it for awhile and I decided to use it so I could have some tea. I thought that since I was using it, I should wipe it down a little. This is what I call his ""first offence"". The tray was so sticky that the top wouldn't come off and when it did come off I discovered that there was mold growing inside of it. I was disgusted and told him to clean it or he would lose the right to use the Keurig. He didn't, until three days later when my mom yelled at him for it. He started buying water filters for it after that, so I let him continue using it. 
The ""second offense"" came a little later. This isn't as bad, but after the mold incident I was less forgiving. He wouldn't clean out the ground that would collect in the top. So I asked him that if he was going to use it for coffee, if he could clean out the grounds that got left there. He didn't, until my sister got involved.
 The ""third offense"" is actually four of the same occurrences. When he would switch out the filters he would always misplace one, or he just wouldn't see it sitting there on the self. If he didn't see it he would yell at mom and me for moving his things. After the fourth time of this I took my Keurig, cleaned it out and packed it away for until I move, so that he can't use it.

My wife is saying how she feels like our anniversary is unimportant to me and the trip is all about my brother and his birthday. Which it will be, for 3 days at the end.

The title is a bit hyperbole - we have the occasional small-talk. Stuff like ""good morning"" or ""how's your day moving along"" but that's about it. He's the one that now initiates that (more detail below).

I tend to work outside the apartment (coffee shops, coworking spaces, etc.) 2-3 times a week. I also go out once or twice during weeknights and most weekends I'm either out on the town or hiking/camping. He is almost always in his room, day and night. He's only left town a couple times since moving here. He doesn't hike, doesn't do winter sports, doesn't do intramural sports. He does connect with his friends on the East Coast via Skype occasionally and enjoys playing videogames.

What gets me the most is his headphones are almost always in. From the beginning of us living together, it's been that way. So there have been over a dozen times where I've tried to strike up conversation and gotten no response. Or he'll be playing video games in the living room (in silence, only he has his headphones in). It just isn't conducive to dialogue and generally when people have headphones in, I feel like it means they don't want to be disturbed and/or they're in their own zone. 

Additionally, when we first started living together, I would invite him out to coffee shops or to coworking spaces. He turned down those opportunities at least 5 times, so I stopped inviting him out for work days. That eventually developed into me stopping inviting him out to anything I'm doing.

So I'm at the point where I don't make an effort to talk to him. It makes me feel a little bad, but it doesn't seem to cause any issues.

Growing up, I was obese.  Very obese.  Throughout my adolescent and high school years, I was 200 +lbs.  At 5'2, that's a lot of weight to carry and my peers definitely never let me forget it.  My mother, with whom I love very much, has always been very thin and I remember being seven years old and wanting to spend time with her - while in her room, she would try on clothes and ask me if I thought she looked fat.  She fat shamed people in front of me and would always point out how I was the biggest girl in the room.  She told me about the salad diet and fed me only salad for dinner many times.

After graduating college, she told me I would never find a job or a partner if I didn't lose weight.  EVERYTHING I ate was a constant reminder that I would be useless in every day life.

Three years ago, I made a complete lifestyle change and successfully shed nearly 80lbs from my frame.  Though I physically look well and healthy, I have a twisted and distorted way of viewing food.  I exercise nearly 90 minutes a day, eat the same foods over and over again day after day, and feel unbelievably guilty every time I eat one little cookie or cupcake.  I have no friends or romantic partners because I schedule life around eating and going to the gym.  I truly hate this.

Last night, my mother and I had a full on BLOW UP.  Now she told me I was too thin and was worried about me.  I ended up going absolutely crazy and told her she was the reason I am the way I am - afraid of eating - that my earliest memories are of her weighing herself in front of me and telling me how no one would ever love me if I wasn't ""skinny"". It was pretty fucking bad and my father had to separate us.

I cried myself to sleep.  This morning, my brother called me and demanded that I apologize to her.  While I admit I had a breakdown, this has been building up inside of me for years and came to a head when she made a comment about how I should now eat MORE than what was on my plate.

While I understand WE are responsible for the choices we make in life, I can't help but feel that she led me down a very dangerous road.  I want to get better ..

27131,"AITA for cutting off my child financially for lying to me about her grades?. My child is 21 and a junior at an expensive private university. My husband and I pay for **everything**; her food, her housing, or tuition. Our only condition was that she had to maintain her grades to at least a 3.0 and she had to do a summer job/internship every summer. We even gave her a $100/week allowance!

This would be a good time to note that we live in Georgia. We have the Zell Miller scholarship and she got accepted into UGA, which means she would’ve had her entire tuition paid for. She begged us to let her go to her dream school and because financials weren’t that big a problem to us, we relented, with the conditions listed above.

She’s been telling us (her father and I) that she has a 3.7 and is doing amazing for the last 3 years. We were so proud (it never crossed our mind that she could be lying). She would also frequently post herself on her Instagram at parties in the middle of the week and drinking with friends, but because she was doing fine academically, we just let her have her freedom.

Anyways her brother is a freshman at GA Tech. He ended his first semester with a 2.8, putting him at risk for losing his scholarship. He told us he was only on track for a 3.2 this semester (too low to maintain the scholarship). We asked him why he wasn’t doing great and that he needs to be more focused on his academics when he got defensive and told us that “at least he wasn’t failing like his sister”.

This is going over the character limit so to make a long story short, our daughter has been lying the entire time about her grades. She has a 2.3 GPA and it on track for failing a class this semester. My husband and I were furious, and told her that because she wants to lie and deceive us like that, we were no longer going to fund her school at all. If she still wants to go there, she’s going to need to take out loans, and we’re cutting her off completely (total cost is about $30,000 a semester).

She was heartbroken and begged us for another chance, and that she was too afraid to come clean. Being afraid is one thing, but she should’ve told us and maybe could’ve provided resources to help her. She lied to us to our faces and made us out to be fools.

This was a week and a half ago, and she blocked us on everything. My husband thinks she’s acting like a spoiled brat, but I starting to feel really bad.

My mom has hoarded literally my entire life (F27). It was a huge factor in my parents' divorce and it's been problematic in her subsequent relationships.

I've kept telling her over the years that she ought to get help and I left her to live with my father. I was sick of having inoperable toilets, an uninsulated room, and rats and bugs crawl on me. The hoarding level at my grandparents' home is almost at this same level.

Eventually she calls and tells me someone scammed her out of 6k on Craigslist as she was trying to make side money for the trip. Starts asking me “what am I going to do? How am I going to pay for gas?” I felt like she wanted me to say “I’ll give you money” but I gave her advice and kept it short.

I start asking again for details on the trip and if she’ll meet me and all she replies is “did you help me when I was having my crisis?” and I say “is that a yes or no?” And she leaves it at that. I end up going to Paris, another girl luckily is able to come too.

32121,"AITA for replying ""I know"" whenever someone makes an obvious observation?. I'm a little tall for a woman. I hit 5'11 at 13 and ever since then random people like to point out that I'm tall. Complete strangers will walk up to me and say ""You're tall!"" or something along those lines. My boyfriend is 6'6 and he gets the comments even worse. Someone has even approached us while we were together to say something. I'm honestly tired of the comments because it's awkward and I don't know what to say, and I don't want to talk to random strangers about my physical appearance.

I was at a basketball tournament a week ago, and after our team was done playing, we went ahead and sat down in the rafters to watch the game with my teammates and friends. While watching, I noticed a feminine looking player on the bench, and because, i wanted to know if a girl could make a basketball team, i asked my friend: “Yo, is that person over there a girl?” And, as soon as i say this the girl in front of me turns
around and says “This is 2019. You can’t just be assuming genders like that, it’s really disrespectful and rude.” At first, i thought she was joking so I chuckled. But then, she asked “What are you laughing at? Gender equality isn’t a joke.

I'm very particular about how I leave my things, basically as close to OCD without being diagnosible.

In this particular case I keep my shampoo and conditioner bottle kids closed and never squeezed in. Today I got home and realised my conditioner bottle was both open and squeezed in. (It had also been moved but share house, things get moved). I've not used it in a few days (dyed hair, using conditioning serum that came with it) so would definitely have noticed if it had been like that for close to a week.

The bottle (as well as my shampoo and body wash on different occasions) has been left like this a couple of times now and I've suspected in the past (going through it far quicker than normal, bottle being moved around) but thought I was being a bit parionoid. There is also the potential they are using other things of mine without me noticing.

Would I be an arsehole if I make a big deal over someone using my stuff without even asking/telling me or should I just accept it as being part of sharehouse living?

I had an important question I wanted to ask them before I decided to go with them (pertaining to the repair of the specific type of shoe I wanted to bring in) and called them, well within their business hours.

The phone rang about six times and went to voicemail. I hung up, called back, and it went to voicemail again. I called back again and again, letting it ring until it went to voicemail, hanging up and calling back. According to my phone records, I called 28 times. Eventually, a guy picked up and he sounded very frustrated. He answered my question, and I came in an hour later.

When I came in to the shop and saw the guy, and he recognized my voice and shoe type. He told me that it’s just him working there today, and when I was calling it had been extremely busy and he didn’t have time to answer the phone. He said it was really rude of me to call that many times and I should have left a voicemail and waited for him to get back.

I think it's just wise to remain abreast of current opportunities, in case a good one comes along that I might be interested in.

Yesterday, that same recruiter reached out to me, saying that she was interested in my background, and could we ""jump on a quick call?"" I replied:

>I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that I'm not interested in working with you. I sent you a LinkedIn message back in October and an email earlier this month regarding positions you posted, and both were ignored.

First thing first, I\[25M\] am in a relationship with my SO \[24F\] for 4 years.

Some months ago i started talking with a friend, Erika\[28F\]. She was in a relationship for around 5 years at this time. We started to talk and play together a lot. Around a month later, she left her SO. She then told me some months after that i was one of the reason : She was interested by me and thats what triggered her to leave her SO. Of course that wasnt the only reason and thing werent going to well between them.

I told her that i won't leave my GF, she knew that and we stayed friend. Fast forward to one week ago, she send me a message, telling me that she is now in a relationship. I know i should be happy for her, but tbh what i felt at this time was more about anger and jealousy.  
Yeah, i know, thats pretty stupid from me considering that if i wanted, i could have been with her. But i didnt want (and i still don't want to!) but knowing that i will no longer be the most important person for her make me feel that way.

Since i couldnt handle this jealousy and didn't want to be a jerk around her,  i decided to block her from everywhere. I didnt tell her exactly why, but since she knew about my jealousy and such, she more or less understood why even if she didn't want me to do that.

Moving on, to the day after he moved out, we got a message from the real estate agency where they told us that the apartment needs cleaning, especially his room and bathroom plus the kitchen (which I know I washed real good before I moved out).

My husband has allowed me to get a third animal as a wedding gift (we have 2 dogs currently). Instead of the long term responsibility of a third animal, I've been fostering! I fostered a dog over thanksgiving break (while roommate plus fiancee were gone) and I recently signed up to foster a kitten.

The kitten is being kept in the basement hallway (hardwood floors). I did not ask our roommate because he's not around often and at his last residence he watched a cat for a month (while dating his current fiancee with her spending the night as his place often). I know that he likes cats more than dogs

Today he comes home and notices the cat which I am fostering for 5 more days. He makes a comment to me about how his fiancee will not be happy. She comes home and asks me if I have a black eye (severe cat allergies, but idc). I say no and explain I have an allergy. She says that she does too. I explain to her that the cat is only upstairs in a towel and is otherwise confined to the hallway. She has since ignored me (but she usually does) and made comments to my roommate about how annoying it is that I fostered a cat without asking her that I could clearly hear.

AITA for not considering my roommates fiancee when fostering a cat?

81226,"AITA For Not Shoveling my Neighbors Driveway. First time poster, sorry for mobile formatting, etc.

So my family and I moved into a duplex last summer. I grew up in this community, and thus have a pretty good feel for its customs. Generally speaking, families help each other shovel snow if they're able, especially if they have a snowblower.

All through last winter I've kept with this custom with the neighbor with whom we have a connected driveway. I say connected driveway, though the neighbours are very adamant that it's two separate driveways. Early on this was somewhat contentious, but eventually we came to respect their property to the point we always inform others to park on the street when visiting us. 

That being said, I'm an able-bodied young man whose relatively in shape, so I don't mind shoveling their driveway if it's nothing too deep, and even when it's deeper I'll do it somewhat begrudgingly. I don't have a snowblower, so this adds up to a lot of time snd effort December through April. They've never said thank you, or even said a kind word to our family other than to say my daughters outfit was cute derisively when she was wearing a tutu. This sticks in my partners craw more than it does mine, especially given that they aren't particularly nice or appreciative of free physical labour.

This past weekend my province got hit with a massive snowstorm, 96cm and ~150km/h winds packing it all down, which resulted in military personnel being called in to aide anyone requiring assistance during the state of emergency declared by the city. Over the past few days people have shoveled out their own driveways, and if able to have helped others. I shoveled mine on my own before anyone was free to help me (approx 8 hours of shoveling), and then helped my neighbor across the street before her son walked down with his snowblower to finish it off. I can't stress how much snow this really is when accumulated from the wind, and it really made me too tired physically to shovel my neighbours driveway again, especially for someone so ungrateful.

My neighbours are fully able to do it themselves, as evidenced by them having done their own before I've woken up on a few occasions over the past two years. They have not been out shoveling their own driveway at all.

I feel like the asshole because the part of my community I take pride in is that sense of community I'm now ignoring. But at the same time, I feel like I have no obligation to help them because they've disengaged from me as part of the community and it's literal hours of physical labour for people that don't appreciate it. I'm genuinely conflicted as to whether or not I should help them.

I dated this girl, that I was completely head over heels for, for about a year and a half. We ended up breaking up because the long distance we had to endeavor in the last couple months of our relationship was extremely difficult for us. It took me months to try to move on from her and to this day, I can tell you some feelings are still there for her. We still talk sometimes and we have hooked up a few times since the break-up. 
So I just learned recently that my friend of a long time has started to try to get with her constantly. They even went hung out a few times (with other people). She ended up telling me over lunch what all happened and how he was confessing his feelings for her and she virtually said it could never happen (she showed me the texts). I do 100 percent believe that she was flirting back with him and I was leading him on in some ways. He told me later that nothing was going to happen between them, but the only reason was because she told him no. He knew and still knows how I feel about her, even though after this incident the feelings for her are starting to disappear rapidly. He had no remorse for me and only felt pity for himself, because she had rejected him.

26283,"AITA for letting my 3 year old disabled son have a head start at a family race?. Recent weekend get together with my extended family, and we were having a bbq. My sister in law had put up kiddie games etc that the kids were competing in and there were candy prizes. 

She’d set up a race for the small kids- under 5’s, because there’s a lot of those in my family. It was a simple straight line race and there were literal kiddy plastic markers and a start and finish sign. 

My 3 year old boy has a knee that hasn’t developed properly- he’s in physical therapy, miiiight need an operation as he gets older, but mostly the poor kid finds it hard to run or walk and has a little funny limp that slows him down. 

As it was a goddamn kids race and I just wanted my son to be happy, when the kids crowded around to start the race I said ‘Chris should get a head start’ mostly kidding. My brother, other sister in law, and mom and dad all enthusiastically agreed and it was actually my brother who let my son a few feet ahead of the start line and then gave the instruction for all the other kids to follow. 

My son won, but not because the other kids were slow- most of em meandered falling over, some of em were chewing the grass- some of ran straight to mom or dad ignoring the finish line, just doing what kids do. There were no actual 5 year olds, just a few kids my sons age and younger. 

My sister in law who was hosting the party was super pissy about it and purposefully withheld a prize from Chris. I figured that was fair enough because he cheated, but she kept shaking her head at him saying ‘bad! You cheated’ which pissed me off. He’s a kid. Who had a lot of fun in the race. Wtf dude.

He’s kind, thoughtful, fun to be with and very intelligent, in the lazy genius kind of way. In college we took a bunch of classes together, and while I spent hours upon hours studying to eventually get a 3.9 GPA, he played video games and watched Netflix. His GPA was 3.8.

I was proud that he could get that GPA without even studying, but at the same time, part of me felt disheartened that I spent so much effort to achieve something that he was able to achieve almost effortlessly. This continued when we started reviewing for the LSAT. He got great scores for his initial tests, while I got not so great scores. I was honestly happy for him, but I also felt insecure about the whole thing. For the last few weeks, the only thing I could think about is what I would do if he gets into to the school we want and I don’t. Which is a very realistic possibility.

Yesterday I suddenly thought that I don’t want to go to law school anymore. I'm still thinking about it, but right now I feel like I just want to take another career path, one that’s different from my boyfriend’s, so that I won’t feel pressured or insecure about his accomplishments.

When the day trip is over he calculated the cost of fuel and his time used and decide that owe him the figure he concluded upon, this might seem fair in some cases but I have driven him long distances and short in the past without evening bring up the cost of fuel.

In the evening we met up with another friend and go to a restaurant and treat decide to treat the friend who drove for the day trip and I paid for the others meal because he doesn't get paid till next week (so do !)  so i end up paying for the table.

So now he has decided that i owe him the full value of the VAT.

My friends are aware that im considerably better of then them but every time i go out with this friend he's 100% convinced i owe him something. I have paid for meals and other small things and not once been treated to a meal or anything. If i drive they owe me no fuel money, if he drives I owe him money.

My original thoughts were naive - that they treat me out when they have the money to do so but every time i go out with them I doubt it even [more.It](https://more.It) isn't like we go to upmarket places they can't afford the meals total less than £12 each and i never really choose I let them decide.

So here's the story: For the past 10 years, my dad had massive amounts of suspicious debts all over the place that we still don't even know what they are even today. To pay up all those debts, he sold many things, but most of these were insignificant things. But the moment he had to sell his own taxi's car plate, he was finally exposed.

When I was 20 years old and a student, I met a girl online who was 26 and worked as a nurse. She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated ""naturally"" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.

My wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fiancée, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.

The whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me?

Rachel is a bright girl, very smart and has always performed well grades-wise. She always seemed really nice so it was sad to hear what she had been doing. She's a very fashionable girl, loves designer clothes and things like that and is obsessed with brand names. 

It was Rachel's first session today, and she turned up dressed head to toe in her expensive gear. I didn't approve. Not necessarily because the clothes would get dirty since we'd be wearing aprons anyway, but more because she will be among people who have literally nothing and are completely desperate. I didn't feel comfortable with her wearing items of clothing that cost hundreds if not thousands in front of their faces.

I made Rachel change her clothes. Her and I are roughly the same build though I'm a bit taller. I got some plain clothes of mine (jogging bottoms and t shirt) for her, she got changed and we got going.

To avoid scandal and not having our behavior reflect badly on our youngest siblings, to help save our souls, and to ease the pressure on Mary's wallet. That is the order those reasons were given to me. Liz and Luke are cool with this. 

I'm hella not. My parents haven't expressed concerns about where I sleep in the last two years, knowing I spend 9/10 weekends at Abes place. They're also cool with Luke and Liz living together. To say anything now seems hypocritical at the very least. I don't think it is fair to anyone aside from Mary. And my parents are control freaks who left me with emotional trauma that I'm still trying to work through. 

Abe will follow my lead as this is my family we are dealing with, as I would if the situation were reversed. Liz doesn't want to create drama and Luke agrees.

63321,"AITA for not watching a video of my little cousin, who just had surgery for her cancer?. I know the title sounds bad but stay with me. 

First off: I have OCD. Diagnosed. A contamination phobia that has to do specifically with raw meat and reptiles (I know, wtf), but also with general germs. My mom is aware of my OCD and is very annoyed by it. 

The situation: my mom came into my room asking if I saw the video of my cousin. I said, “no, can you send it to me?” She proceeds to say, “that’s too hard, let me just show you on my phone instead”. She leaves to get her phone. 

At the time, she was in the middle of cooking chicken. I was totally freaked out about touching  her phone, which she’d just touched after handling raw meat. My OCD is like, no do not touch that phone. Do. NOT. 

I said again, “can you just send it to me?” But she already is bringing the phone in. I started to get really anxious and just kinda shrunk back and said “I’ll watch it later, I’ll get it from grandma”. 

Then she told me that I was so mean. And implied I should be more empathetic. And I feel like a huge asshole now because of my poor cousin, and I couldn’t even get over myself enough to handle the damn phone. I did talk to my cousin the day of and after the surgery, but I still feel like garbage about this. AITA?.

I’m now with an incredible woman who I hope to someday marry but she can get very jealous. I told her about the account from the start and even gave her complete access to it. She seemed to only go on it to see if I had and what I was doing and brought it up now, a year later, accusing me of still caring about my ex because I look at her page from time to time.

48947,"AITA For cutting off friendship with someone who was like a sister?. Names changed because I'm not sure if anyone we know uses reddit. I (24F) have been friends with my friend, ""Leslie"" (25F) since we were young children. I'm an only child and she came from a family that was very difficult. She ended up coming to my house more and more as we got older and I genuinely considered her family, as did my family. When I went to college and moved out, she and my mom continued their relationship and had dinner with each other around once a week. My mom paid her to take care of my pets whenever my mom worked late and they became very, very close throughout the years. I moved back around 2 years ago. She and my mom grew apart after Leslie moved in with her fiance. This is all relevant to the event that happened.

A few months ago, my mom had brain surgery. She wasn't driving, worked fewer hours, and I was her primary caregiver. Since Leslie had moved out of her family home, as had her two sisters, her mom was living with her childhood/family dog. Leslie's mom went out of the country and her sister originally took the dog to take care of. Her dog is elderly, sick, incontinent, and very poorly trained. Her sister could no longer care for him as he got into fights with her sister's dog and bit one of her sister's kids. 

We told Leslie that she could bring her dog over to our house and stay with him until her mom came back from her trip. She came, dropped him off, and went to her fiance's house (she couldn't keep him there since he was older and her fiance's family had other pets that he didn't get along well with). Her dog was coughing all night, peed all over the house, and refused to go outside when we tried to bring him out to go to the bathroom. We told Leslie that we agreed that he could stay with us only if she stayed too as I couldn't care for him and neither could my mom. She said she couldn't, got into a screaming fight with my mom, and then left with her dog. I haven't spoken to her since and I truly don't think we're in the wrong for telling her to stay over with her dog while he was at our house. 

So reddit, AITA in this situation?

Out of nowhere this gust of wind came and lifted her skirt for maybe 2 seconds. Long enough for me to see it.

I wasn’t staring or anything, it’s just that I was maybe 10 feet behind her and it happened so fast that before I realized what was happening it was over.

She tried to cover her ass with her hands but didn’t really help. So she looked back at me with this embarassed smile and I pretended nothing happened. 

We got to the corner, so now we’re side by side, waiting for the light to change, and  she looked at me and was kinda laughing, kinda embarassed, so when the light turned green for us to cross, I said: if it makes you feel any better, that was the highlight of my week.

She started laughing and said “ thank you”, then I said have a good day, she said you too and I started walking in front of her. Then  I pretended to cover my ass, just like she did, and I looked back and she was laughing her ass off. I waved good bye and she said bye, with a smile on her face. I went my way, she went hers

I told what happened to some friends I met after that, and I got a divided response. Some thought it was funny/cute/nice, trying to make her feel better, and some said I was totally off limits/ disrespectful 

The way I see it, it all has to do with her response. She laughed and smiled and kept talking in a very nice way, she didn’t look offended or groced out, so the way I see it , it wasn’t offensive to her.

And I only said something because she seemed very approachable and friendly, making eye contact. If she didnt look at me or seemed disturbed, I wouldn’t have said anything

70029,"AITA for not wanting to make a 3 hour trip to save someone 15 minutes.. My brother (lets call him MB) just moved into his new home. My family and I have been helping MB move into the home over the last month and there are just two more trips of belongings that need to be made in order to finish the move. He is busy for the week and one of these trips is time sensitive, a storage unit, meanwhile the other trip can wait. My other brother (OB) and I have offered to move the storage unit belongings while MB is out, overall this is a 3 hour trip minimum.

Now OB wants us to make the second trip as well (another 3 hours minimum) as an act of kindness towards MB. This trip consists of nothing but a wheelbarrow and an ATV.

On a normal week, MB passes by where he used to live daily (where the belongings are) and even stops by for around half an hour every time before going to his new house. Because of this I think it would be best if OB and I just load up everything for MB one day when he stops by as he is already on his way to his house, and MB just spend 15 minutes unloading, rather than OB and I spend 3 hours round trip to do the same task. I’m willing to help MB but I just find this trip to be inefficient.

56687,"AITA for ghosting a friend for inappropriate behavior?. So let's call this girl Jen. We were friends from elementary school on, we're in our twenties now. I kinda started drifting from her in high school after I came out to her and she accused me of being in love with her (I'm a bisexual woman and she's a lesbian). It was around this time she started talking online to kids about five or six years younger than her. I thought it was kind of weird but i brushed it off for a while.

It was also around this time she started to get paranoid-- she had been bullied pretty severely for years so it wasn't shocking for her to think others disliked her, but this was intense. She became convinced that the entire staff of the school was united against her and would frequently make long Facebook posts about it. I encouraged Jen to seek therapy. She stopped going after a few months because she said the therapist was against her as well. We grew apart even more as the years passed and by the time college was done, we were hanging out maybe twice a year tops and talking even less.

That takes us to the present. She's dropped most of her friends to talk to more children from ages 15-17. She calls herself their ""mommy"". She still makes long, convoluted posts about how the staff of our old high school (which she still regularly visits) are conspiring against her.  I'm a teacher and being associated with something that has even the appearance of being inappropriate could destroy my career. I also am in a very conservative area and work with Jen's mother. Anything she said to her mother would without a doubt be passed around to our coworkers, and that includes my sexuality.

I was worried she would out me to her mother if I confronted her, and that's why I ghosted. I blocked her on everything except text (I forgot) and she texted me a few weeks later asking what the hell happened. I told her that although I still cared about her, I believed our friendship was unhealthy and I wished her the best. She got very angry and I proceeded to block her there too.

My girlfriend never bothered deleting Jen off Facebook. So she saw her status a few weeks later about her ""ex best friend"" which contained details obviously specific to me, about how I ruined her life, am a lying whore, have no friends, etc. Jen's friends are texting me saying I'm an awful person and ruined her life.

7443,"AITA for accidentally interrupting a classmate, and then ""fixing"" it?. I was in a discussion section today for one of my classes, and the room layout is a little funky. We all sit around a table, but it's not round or square--in fact, it's a long-ass rectangle, like an old-fashioned dining room. My school is very ""historic,"" so in addition to the old furniture, the lighting is kind of dim.

My professor is great, but he doesn't have a ton of clear discussion policies when we're talking about a text (it's an English class). I'd say most people in the class, including me, raise hands to be recognized about 75% of the time. However, there are definitely many moments when, due to the pace of the conversation, people just tend to jump in without waiting--usually when the room has been silent for a little while, or when someone is asking someone else a direct question.

Today in class, the professor posed a question, and there was silence for a little bit before I spoke up to answer (without raising my hand). However, as soon as I started talking, I realized my professor had begun to gesture towards another student, who was evidently raising her hand. I didn't initially see due to the nature of the room, but I (in a split second) figured it would be better to keep going than to cut myself off, so I finished my thought. My comment ended up sending the conversation down a different path than the original question (even though my answer was relevant, I promise), and I ended up feeling bad that the other woman never got to share her thought. 

When we entered the last five minutes of class, the professor asked if anyone had any lingering questions or comments. I piped up and said, ""I was just wondering if [student I interrupted] had any thoughts about [question from before]?"" (This type of question isn't atypical for the class--people often ask for a specific someone's opinion during the last few minutes because we all have fairly specific areas of expertise). 

I scooted forward in my seat to see her reaction, and she kind of embarrassedly and dismissively said ""Oh, not really..."" I felt really bad for putting her on the spot, but I also felt a little embarrassed myself because she hadn't answered my question. This class is obviously very heavily based in discussion, and one of our few roundtable rules is that everyone needs to at least attempt an answer to any question posited directly to them.

They currently rent out half the place (its a duplex) to a couple who have been there for 10+ years.

34296,"WIBTA for not listening to my boyfriend's concerns about my living arrangement?. I have been seeing Ben (say) for a few months now, and we recently had a long and annoying conversation about something that was bothering him.

I live with Fred and Andy (say). I've known Fred since sophomore year in college (I'm 25 now), and Andy is a solid 4-5 on the Kinsey scale. He's in a long-term relationship of nearly a year with his male partner. Fred has been single and focusing on his startup.

I've been living with them for more than a year now (just renewed our leases) because it's very close to work for me, a great location, and you know, I've had zero troubles with them. We each have our own bedrooms but share living, kitchen, and bathroom spaces.

Ben says he's starting to get uncomfortable with the fact that I'm very casual with my dressing around the house and around them. I don't need to, and don't often wear a bra at home. I lounge a lot in my bathrobe especially during the hot summer months or when I'm feeling lazy. And I never take clothes into the bathroom. I'm always in my robe or towel. 

He thought that if the relationship is getting serious, I need to pay attention to him not liking the arrangement or at least promising him that I'll be more ""careful"" with them around.

42344,"WIBTA if I tell my roommate he can't host a Bible study in our apartment?. A number of weeks ago, I overheard my roommate talking about a weekly Bible study he was going to host in our apartment. I knew this Bible study would affect me in a negative way, so I suggested he try to host it somewhere else. He said ""I'll look into it."" I knew he wasn't actually going to look into it, but I didn't push the issue further at this time.

Today, I told him that I'd really appreciate it if he found somewhere else to host the Bible study. He responded ""I'll look into it"" with no guarantee it will be moved. When I pressed the issue a bit further, he said that ""When it comes down to it, I can have people over sometimes, and you can too. It's give and take""

Now, before I ask you guys the question, I'll explain what the Bible study is and how it affects me. 

There are two parts of the Bible study: First, they play the board game, ""Secret Hitler."" I don't know how this game is played, but I know it involves lots of arguing and is loud af. This part lasts for about an hour, and prevents me from being productive in the apartment. Even with noise cancelling headphones, I can still hear them yelling in the other room, and it's difficult to focus. 

Second, they have the ""Bible part."" This is the part where they talk about life, discuss the Bible, and pray. This part lasts about half an hour. This part of the Bible study affects me more than the ""Secret Hitler"" part. I grew up in the church, but don't have fond memories of it. When I hear them talking like people talked at Sunday school and youth group, it brings up a lot of bad emotions. It also makes me really uncomfortable to be in a room full of people essentially talking bad things about my choices (Leaving the church, not reading the Bible, ""living a life of sin"") even though the conversation isn't directed at me.

When I talked to him today, he essentially said tough luck to me if he can't find another spot, because he'd still host it in that case.

So, WIBTA if push the issue further and tell him he has to move the Bible study, regardless of whether he finds a new spot for it?

TL;DR

My roommate hosts a weekly Bible study in my apartment. It brings up bad memories for me because it reminds me of when I was a part of the church. WIBTA if I told him he can't host it here even if he doesn't find a new place for it?

171,"WIBTA for telling someone to STFU for their incessant and often childish comments about my Mjölnir pendant?. I'm posting this here because I feel that whilst the other person is annoying, it also seems like a minor thing to get into a stupid argument about. 

  I identify with Norse Paganism (Ásátru) and for the last couple of months I have chosen to wear a silver Mjölnir pendant. It's not something I particularly advertise and I'm not one for being obnoxious or in-your-face about it. The actual pendant itself is small and I do sometimes simply keep it hidden. Other times though I do wear it more openly although this depends. 

  Now this person obviously did see it, and right from the off they started making comments. At first it was mostly silly - I got a load of comments about how I must be a Marvel fan, some comments about LARPing and now I'd watched too much of the show Vikings and the like. Then it grew into them asking me ""you still wearing that thing? Surely you've got other necklaces?"" and also ""Aren't you just doing this for attention?"". 

 I did make an assumption quite mistakenly that they simply didn't know much about Norse mythology or what Mjölnir even is. I didn't make this a religious debate so much as a simple historical and mythological one, and most of what I tried to tell them was so simple a 3 year old could likely have understood. It became apparent though that I was wasting my time- the person was simply not going to consider anything that didn't agree with their already existing opinions, and it must also be said that in the past this same person has treated many things I care deeply about in a very poor, mocking manner (just by way of a random example, they have often mocked my time spent learning and playing chess) and even with active and quite obvious contempt. 

  Which leads me to now. I've tried being entirely reasonable with this person despite all of this and I've tried simply choosing to ignore it, which hasn't worked. Now I'm tempted to simply tell them that if they don't STFU about it then I'm really going to lose my temper and then there'll definitely be a big argument.

today she comes into my workplace telling me she got me a surprise and hands me a fake succulent in a cute little Halloween pot. apparently the cashier told her it was real and she was super excited to give it to me because she knows I take care of plants, and immediately upon grabbing it I knew it was fake but I didn't say anything. I think her memory is going and she might be developing, I don't know, some kind of dementia or something; I know she has cataracts at least. therefore I don't blame her for not knowing it was a fake plant because to its credit it's pretty realistic looking.

My partner, the book lover in the relationship, is thrilled and we arranged to pick them up tomorrow.

63045,"WIBTA - If I don’t want to sell my car to my SO’s cousin. I’m going to be selling a car soon.  I bought it ten years ago, before I was married.  We don’t currently need it for our family transpiration - it’s our third car.  Our original plan was to just take it to Carmax, get the best deal, and just make it easy since we will be moving soon and it will take the least amount of time.  

My husband mentioned to his family that we’d be selling the car soon, and his cousin mentioned he might want to buy it as a “commuter” car.  I really don’t feel like taking the extra effort to sell it to his cousin for a few reasons:  1.  His cousin lives out of state, more than 500 miles away.  We’d have to deal with completely a sale to an out of state buyer, which I’ve never done before.  We will definitely not be driving the car 500 miles to the cousin to sell it in his state of residence.  2.  I have no idea what his cousin would be offering at this point, but my husband is very attached to this part of his family, so it’s potentially less than we could get elsewhere.  3.  I personally dislike this cousin.  He’s called me a c*** (which I could clearly hear in the background) when I was on the phone with my husband, and who knows what else previously.  4.  This cousin is not know for good judgement.  He’s a convicted felon (many years ago, not for a dangerous offense) which the family chalks up as “bad judgement.”  Even if I researched it and executed the sale to an out of state buyer correctly, I’d still be nervous I did it wrong and could be liable for him crashing the car or just doing something else dumb.  

It basically boils down to I don’t want to sell him the car because it’ll be more work and I don’t like this cousin enough to have to exert a significant amount of extra effort.  But, my husband has already told his family it’s my decision since it’s my car I bought before our marriage, so, I’ll be painted as bad guy if I don’t go along.  Before I commit one way or the other: WIBTA?. Am I the asshole?","NTA. 

If you’ve never sold a car to CarMax before- it’s the greatest experience. I’ve done it twice and left them a 5 Star Yelp review. They make it super easy and offered way more than any dealership trade-in. One dealership told me to run to CarMax, because that offer was too good to be true.

That being said- I understand why you wouldn’t want to do the extra effort and potentially lose money.

You can sell you car to anyone you want. NTA, but if you’re worried about fallout from your husband’s family- I would suggest this- go to CarMax and get your offer. It should be good for seven days- at that point state you will sell it to an instate relative for X + (buffer amount), since CarMax saves you time and money in the sale transaction whereas you’ll otherwise be wasting your own time and paying some fees. Give them seven days (length of CarMax offer) to give you a cashiers check or some other form of “cash.”

55502,"WIBTA if I didn’t let my boyfriends brother come out with us?. Very basic title but there is important background info to share. 
So basically, this past Friday night my bf changed our plans on me last second to go hang out with friends. I was upset and it was a dick move of him and he apologized and we agreed to do something Saturday night (yesterday). So Saturday rolls around and I told my bf we should go eat ramen and then watch a movie at his house; I was hungry and wanted to relax since I had had a long day at work. He agreed happily and when I was off work I called him to discuss final details. 

He hits me out of nowhere with news that since his dad hadn’t bought any food for their house, his brother had no food for dinner and his dad gave him $20 to get him food. I was confused and just accepted that we’d have to get his brother food first before we could go out and eat together. 

So I pick up my bf and his brother and we’re driving to Burger King to get him food, when my bf discreetly texts me a few times asking if we should just bring his brother with us to get ramen. By this point I was already annoyed since I was hungry since I hadn’t eaten at work all day, and knowing my bf bailed on my the night before, I just wanted a nice date night alone with him. 
So I didn’t respond to his texts about his brother coming along and we got his brother his food and took him back to his house. 

Then later when my bf and I are finishing up at the ramen place he brings it up and says how his brother had been home all day just doing nothing and we could’ve let him come. I immediately get upset since first off my bf didn’t think we were going on a date, and second, seemed to totally forget that he stood me up the night before, and third, always makes his brother out to be a victim since their dad doesn’t help him much but in my eyes it’s not my problem and I can’t fix their home life. He also is always depressed and down my bf says and basically smokes all day to cope, which again isn’t my problem.

So WIBTA since I didn’t let my bf’s brother come eat with us??. Am I the asshole?","ESH. Your boyfriend shouldn't have blown off your plans the night before at the last minute to hang out with friends. And if he wanted to include his brother, he should have brought that up with you ahead of time, not when his brother was in the car with you.

However, getting mad because he's trying to take care of his brother when their father won't makes you suck too, in my opinion. The whole ""not my problem"" attitude comes off as cold and a little self centered. Their home life may not be your problem, but it is his, and instead of supporting him or understanding, you're treating caring for his family as the same as blowing you off for friends, and it's not.",1,0,1,0,0

73074,"AITA for still being upset with my parents for making me take a loan?. Hello! This happened when I was 18, I’m 23 now and still upset about the situation. 
Also I’m on mobile, so sorry for if there are formatting issues and English is not my first Language :,> 

Okay so, when I was 18 my parents asked me and my little sister to start paying for living at home (my older sister never had to do so) they never told me all the details about the situation (I asked why and they just said we had to) so my sister and I started paying for our rooms. 

I got upset because I was in therapy 2 times a week at that time and dealing with school which was very emotionally draining for me (I had already extended my school time by a year because of therapy) I would not be able to have a job at this time because of this. My only option was to take a student loan to be able to pay my parents. 

I gave them 4/1 of my money for about a year. 

I feel it was unfair of them to demand I take out a loan, we never really struggled with money, from what I understand (they never told me much) and they didn’t consider the mental state I was in back then. 

I still get sad when I think about it, but I also feel really petty. I want to tell my mum that I’m upset about my debt, but I don’t want to start drama or upset my mum. I feel like it’s an unspoken issue in our relationship and I still love them so very much, but this debt is hanging heavy over my head.

AITA for still holding on to these petty feelings?. Am I the asshole?","NTA you’re not the asshole because nobody ever explained the situation to you to your satisfaction. No way I’m taking out a loan unless I know all of the details as to its real value in my life. You took out a loan and got nothing in return. Perhaps your loan prevented your family from financial ruin but you have no way to know that. 

Especially because some time has gone by and you are probably more adult now, I highly recommend you ask your parents for more information about their reasons for asking for the money. There are casual and not so casual ways of doing that. But if you don’t know it will eat you up. Money issues between family members should be settled ASAP, as they can truly tear families apart.

79323,"AITA for refusing to let my parents pass their traffic tickets to my name?. So my father is a reckless driver. Think the biggest idiot you’ve ever had to drive by. That’s my dad. 

He’s always getting tickets, for speeding or running red lights or whatever, and the tickets come to our house by mail in his name (the car’s in his name) but in order for him to not have his license suspended, my mom passes his tickets to her name (as if she were the one driving). 

So he got so many tickets he actually got HER license suspended. You’d figure he’d feel guilty about it and be more responsible but no — yet another ticket has arrived on the mail yesterday and my parents want me to pass it to my name. I say I won’t enable his reckless driving and risk my license as my mom did, and that it’s not that hard to not get tickets. I’ve been driving for 3 years and have not gotten a single one, ever. 

Since he works in another town and drives there everyday he can’t afford to have a suspended license which is why they’re insisting so much. I live in their house and they still pay for all my expenses so I get it but also: just drive like a normal person I guess. 

TL;DR Am I the asshole for refusing to let my dad pass his traffic tickets to my name even though he really needs his license to work (and support me)?

EDIT: HE GOT ANOTHER TICKET. So yep. Thank you for your verdict; as people have pointed out I have been brought up in a way that made me question if I’m the one being selfish here. I was taught that loyalty = letting people in your family do whatever to you, and if you refuse, you’re selfish. 

The situation has been aggravated by the second ticket but I am firmer than ever on my decision to not lend them my name. I suggested they pay someone else to take the points for my dad; I know that’s still illegal but it should solve the problem, they’ll just have to pay more.

23118,"AITA for not making the egg how my dad likes it?. My parents and I have a very rocky relationship, and I am extremely into the culinary arts and such. Today I decided I would make some french toast, some hashbrowns with a few spare potatoes, and some fried eggs. My mom wasn't hungry, so I just cooked for my dad. I make the entire plate of food, and then I serve it to him. The egg was completely cooked with a runny yolk, and then he tells me he wants a ""cooked"" egg. I didn't know what he meant, so I said ""it is cooked"". I then get barraged with how it's still not cooked and how it's still slimy (which if you've ever eaten an egg before, the yolk isn't slimy, and the whites were set.). I decided that I'd just make him another egg with a cooked yolk and everything and leave it at that, despite how we had argued over if it was cooked or not. Then he continues to ask me, ""are you mad? don't be mad, c'mon.""

&#x200B;

This irritates me, so I just head off to my room in a heap of anger at being harassed over an egg. I then hear him three hours later complaining to my mom about how it's just an egg and that I need to get over it. I was just in my room, and frankly I had forgotten about the entire thing.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I should make three things clear:

&#x200B;

1. I never knew that my dad didn't like runny yolks. I'd served them to him countless times before, and when I asked if he wanted a fried egg, I didn't know he wanted it with a hard yolk.
2. My father does have some degree of mental illness (bipolar, schizophrenia), and I am now starting to think that he may be having a bad day because he's run out of marijuana (we live in Canada and he likes to smoke it). He always makes a big deal out of small thing so that my mom goes out and buys him more. He has his own car, phone, etc, but doesnt do it himself for some reason.
3. He was raising his voice and getting hostile over it, and I was less angry than annoyed.. Am I the asshole?","NTA

You didn't have to make him anything. If he truly was barraging you he absolutely overreacted. If he wanted a different kind of egg that's fine, but he should have just asked you nicely and see if you'd make him one.

My sister and I have always been extremely close. A few years ago she met her boyfriend, and from the very beginning, it has been a long distance relationship (we’re talking different continents). 

And just to make that clear, I love her boyfriend like a brother, I think he’s perfect for her, so naturally I was very excited when about a year ago they told me about their plans of him moving to our country in the foreseeable future. 

Yet, just now my sister surprised me with their new idea, which is for HER to move overseas to HIS country after she finishes university this year. And, safe to say, I didn’t know how to react at first. 

My sister realized I wasn’t really happy and understandably got sad while trying to comfort me. Saying, it’s just for now. Maybe it won’t even work out and she doesn’t get a visa. 

The thing is, I really want it for them to work the way they want. But I’m also heartbroken just thinking about her leaving me. 

And also, I know my sister, and while she isn’t naïve, she sometimes tends to not thinking about what could go wrong once she made a decision, and I know that it will be a lot harder for her to pursue her career in his country than it is here. I don’t want her to miss out on her dreams because she wants to follow some romantic idea. 
And I don’t really believe in the „just for now“ part either, because once she starts a career there, they buy a home, maybe have kids over there, it will become harder for them to just cut ties and move back to our country. 

I don’t want to ruin this for her, but I can’t just pretend to not be absolutely crushed about the thought of her not being here. I don’t want her to not do it because of me, but if I’m being honest, I hope it doesn’t work and I kind of hate myself for it.. Am I the asshole?","YTA.

44243,"WIBTA for refusing to put my bosses car seat together?. So context. On mobile, sorry in advance. 

I am an executive assistant for a start up company that has a very specialized service with little to no competition, so business is good. My boss, who I will call Miranda, has many, many requests for me that are very out of the box, because it is a small business there are lots of tasks to be done. Running errands, inventory, paying business and home expenses for her, drop offs and pick ups for very heavy equipment or furniture, you get the idea. Just 2 days ago I moved an 8 foot couch, by myself, with a Toyota corolla, so you could say I manage to get things done with determination and critical thinking skills. Everything Miranda has asked of me, I'll do. 

Except. Putting her under 2 year olds car seat in her vehicle. Miranda is a very private and protective person, especially with her kids (4 total). I have barely met them because I only work on the business end of things, which is fine, work/life balance is a fine line. I have two kids of my own she has not met, nor do I see any reason for her to. 

That being said, I feel incredibly uncomfortable putting together her under 2 year olds car seat because I feel this crosses that work/life balance line. Another thing that makes me really uncomfortable about it is the fact I cannot physically carry a child to term due to a myriad of health issues (my two kids are older adopted kids, didn't get them as babies) and dealing with the car seat feels very personal and intimate because of the glaring reminder I won't be putting MY biological child into one. 

I told Miranda I did not want to assemble or transfer a car seat for her and she got very mad at me, told me it was not personal, just logistical and I need to get over it. I responded with all the reasons above why I did not want to do it, she said again to get over it and that I had to do what was assigned to me.

The problem is, this wasn't an isolated incident. B has had a habit of being harsh and antagonizing if someone admitted ignorance in anything, making them feel stupid.

Okay so, I have a friend / coworker that I've known for over a year. We are good friends and hang out and all that. We initially began hanging out in a larger group, but over time the friend group fractured and turned into smaller friend groups. He is very anxious about social interactions and comments frequently that he thinks people don't want to hang out with him or invite him to things.

Here is the thing though: as someone who has actively hung out with him regularly for the past year, I can honestly say it is difficult to hang out with him. He will change the venues and times about 3 times within the hour before the designated hang out, he'll freak out if certain people are invited (we once invited our manager's daughter because she is also a coworker and cool, and he made us disinvite her less than an hour before because he was worried she would say something about him to her dad), and he'll frequently just cancel less than hour beforehand.

That brings us to last week: I invited him to a social work event, and the usual runaround begins: despite him agreeing to the date and time (and mind you, this is a free event paid for by work so money isn't the concern), he starts coming up with excuses with why he doesn't need to go and how it's not important anyway. And here is where my potential assholery comes in: I told him that people have noticed that he's flakey and antisocial and if he truly does want more people to be his friend and hang out with him he should reconsider cancelling all the time.

This really stressed him out and his girlfriend told me on Friday (this happened on Monday) that he's still really upset about it. I told him because it's something I've wanted to breach for a while and it felt appropriate at the time, but knowing that he's so stressed out about it is making me reconsider.

80659,"AITA for going through my brothers phone to try and find out what is wrong with him. My brother (16) has not gone to school for two weeks and has missed 8 days in the 3 last weeks of the term before this term. I have recently learned that his grades are not as good as I thought, his highest grade is one 4, lowest is a U, and everything in between. (We are in the UK. 4 = C, U i think means ungraded/not attempted.)

My mum and I have tried every way we could possibly think of to help him, or to understand why he is struggling with going to school and why his grades are so low. He gives us nothing back, his answers to every question is “I dont know” or some other sarcastic remark. My mum is extremely soft with him because in the past, maybe 2 years ago he was depressed. Not clinically diagnosed, but he was hurting himself for a brief period of time. He didn’t respond to therapy. Then he all of a sudden he was as happy as can be, friends over all the time, confidence overflowing. Since then he gets away with EVERYTHING, with maybe a “stern” talking to, if anything, because my mum doesn’t want to be the reason he goes back to where he was. She was NEVER that soft with me (22F) but thats another topic for another day.

So since we tried talking to him, we tried asking him if there was ANY possible way we could help, we tried going to the doctors, we tried seeking help from his school teachers, we came  up with a week-by-week revision schedule with all three of us working together to improve his grades - he isn’t interested. nothing is helping the situation. 

I know that if my brother misses any more school, my mum will be fined or even sent to prison for failing to get him to school. He knows this too.

So AITA for snatching my brothers phone whilst he was on it and locking myself in my bedroom in order to try and get some information - maybe from his friends or his pictures or SOMETHING - to try and figure out what is bothering him so much that he’s too depressed to go to school?

My mum and I wanted to help - we NEEDED to help, i felt like i had no choice but to do the thing that could very well break our relationship

36625,"AITA for removing someone’s bike from the train and leaving it on the platform?. I commute to my place of work every day by train.

Bicycles are not allowed to be left unattended, yet this rule is often ignored. People prop them up against seats, doors and luggage racks and then go sit down wherever they want. It is not uncommon for entrances/exits to be obstructed and once or twice I have had a bike fall on me mid-journey.

Yesterday it was cold and rainy, so everyone on the platform was jockeying to get onto the train as soon as it pulled into the station. However, when the automatic doors opened, a bike was completely blocking the way so nobody could board the carriage. We waited a few seconds to see if someone would come move it, but no one did.

Some of the people behind me hurried over to a different door, but I was wet and cold and annoyed with the owner of the bike for being so stupid and inconsiderate. So I made the split-second decision to pick it up it and dump it on the platform. As we boarded the train, I shouted down the carriage “Whoever’s bike was blocking the door, it’s now on the platform!”

A guy right up the other end of the carriage looked up in surprise, jumped out of his seat and ran to the bike. He managed to grab it and get back on the train before the doors closed. As he was propping it back up against the opposite door, he said very aggressively “Don’t touch my bike!” to which I replied “Don’t leave it blocking the door then, dickhead”. There was a murmur of assent in the carriage, so he just scowled at me and didn’t say anything else (but he did sit down right next to his bike, so hopefully that means he learned his lesson).

I had no doubts whatsoever about what I’d done until I was telling the story to my friend later on; she was shocked and told me I was out of order. So here I am asking Redditers: AITA?



Edit2: A lot of people commenting that I should have moved the bike and put it somewhere else inside the carriage.

My moms been dating this guy for a year and a half. Hes made is clear he isnt ready to move in together yet and doesnt know when he will be. Not tremendously my business and shes ok with it but I think its worth mentioning. 

Over the past year he hasn't spoken to me beyond one word answers. It really pissed me off after the year marker had passed and nothing had changed.

She knows that I have only yelled at him during situations where his health and safety are at risk. He is about 18 months now, and doesnt understand language yet. So by yelling, I mean I say ""No!"" In a loud and harsh tone, but follow up with softer ""that's dirty/hot, don't touch that"" and redirecting him. 

Examples include when I'm changing his diaper and he reaches down to grab some of his poop. When he decides to stick his hand in the toilet to splash around. When he sticks his hand in the garbage to grab who the hell knows what. 

More recently when he reached for his uncle's freshly pored hot tea. As soon as his uncle (my brother) put the tea on the coffee table I said ""watch the tea"" but this all happened within the span of 2-3 seconds where I repeated the phrase in an increasingly louder voice. By the 3rd time I'm saying it, I am yelling accross the room my son had his hand on the tea and my brother realized it and quickly got the tea out his hand. 

My wife feels that these situations don't warrant raising my voice. More recently she was bringing up with my family that she feels that ""yelling all the time is not right"". This naturally raises concern and my mother is now coming to me asking if I'm hitting him, like I am some sort of abusive parent. I talked with my wife and she admits that she mischaracterized me by saying I do it all the time, but she feels that in situations like him reaching for the garbage or in front of family (tea incident), I shouldn't yell but only talk to him. I feel like given he is young and doesn't understand what is dangerous/words I'm saying in general, it's my responsibility as a father to keep him relatively safe.

There’s danger and then there are ill-advised toddler decisions - I don’t think you are making appropriate distinctions. 

If you are changing his diaper, you’re literally right over him - there is no need to yell. Putting his hand in the garbage is also not ‘dangerous’ - you can wash his hands. In the three times it took you to say “watch the tea” louder and louder, you could have walked over and moved your child away.

At the beginning of our relationship, he was still talking to his ex in secret, and while he now insists they were just good friends, he also deleted all traces of their past conversations. 

He also continued to talk to another woman from the dating website after telling me to delete my dating profiles and making it ""official"", and only in October he confessed to asking this woman for naked pictures at the start of our relationship. I found this out from instagram, when I saw he had been ""liking"" loads of risque photos this local woman had posted. I just couldn't forget about it and wanted to know  why they kept talking, which is when he confessed.

In the last couple of months I learned he still hadn't deleted his dating profiles, just the apps, when an email from one of the profiles appeared on his desktop notifications (We use his PC monitors to watch Netflix etc). That was a concern for me, but he insists he just thought deleting the apps would delete the profiles. I'm not sure I believe this but I have given him the benefit of the doubt...


Recently, however, real concerns developed.

The real concern started though when he developed warts on his genitals around Christmas time.

He has been to the doctors and claims they are another form of warts that arent genital warts  Even if they aren't genital warts, I am concerned they are only appearing in that area.

He's started a new job in the last 6 months and works away quite a bit, so there have been opportunities for him to cheat.

I feel like I'm the asshole for even thinking that about him because he does treat me well, and all his other mistakes happened so early on.

He has been good to me and we are even thinking of buying a house together soon, but the fact that these warts developed have given me real concern, and made me think he has continued to be unfaithful...

AITA for thinking of him like that?

Apparently her friend has a whole cupboard of her own in the house which is filled with chocolate and sweets, and her mum lets her and my sister eat whatever they want from it without any restrictions.

8549,"AITA because I scratched my boyfriend when he was tickling me?. I tell him all the time I hate to be tickled but he really likes it so we have a safety word where he can tickle me and when it's too much (I've been holding out more and more) I can say it. Last night he was tickling me and I said the safeword, and he stopped for a bit but then came back and wouldn't stop even with all my pleas of no and the safe word.

So I started scratching him and I left some marks and it hurt him (didn't draw blood, very short nails) so he got all pissy and left the room.

He came back and was like ""Why couldn't you have punched me or poked me instead"" and I'm a strong puncher so I mean it would hurt the same as scratching him (not as long I guess) and poking doesn't do anything, I just kept saying I used the safe word and he didn't stop.

He expects me to apologize for trying to make him stop by scratching him and I expect him to apologize for not stopping when we used the safe word and everything. I don't know if it's my fault for laughing while saying it and so it doesn't seam like a real safe word but he knows tickling is intense for me and I can't even laugh really I just scream. I was never touched like that growing up so I never had some immunity to it I guess?

I mean it's the safe word for a reason so I know he's already in the wrong but it's more like what should I do to ensure he respects my boundaries and safe word.

She returns home for recovery (doc recommended a rehab facility, stubborn mom refused) she declined and invited her older brother and younger sister to care for her. Younger sister (my aunt) was a nurse and she would be charged with cleaning the surgery site and dressing it...but she neglected it and my mom got an infection...the infection led to her death.

66222,"AITA for using my deceased friend's D&D character in a new campaign years after his death?. I used to play Dungeons and Dragons with a group of guys from high school.  There were 4 of us in total and I was the Dungeon Master.  One of the players Jeff died in a car accident a few years ago.  The other players Andrew, Sam, and I were destroyed and we gave up D&D because even thinking about it just reminded us of Jeff too much to enjoy it.  Well a few months ago and a bit of therapy later I was able to finally process my grief and move past as best I could.  I got back into the game because I feel that Jeff wouldn't want me to give up our hobby over his death.  Andrew and Sam don't feel this way and have given up the game for good.  Their choice I won't push it.

Well I am the DM for this new group I put together and in this campaign the players are in the world a few centuries after the end of the previous world I ran with Andrew, Sam, and Jeff.  Their characters are now regarded as legendary warriors who saved the world several times in the past but died bravely in battle saving it one last time.  So in this world there are orders of knights and mages that are devoted to these characters and tell legends of their past adventures which is just me telling the party about all the old sessions we used to have.

&#x200B;

Andrew and Sam came over last night to hang out and they started asking me about the game.  I had avoided talking about it because Sam was the most affected by Jeff's death and I didn't want to upset him.  But now he was asking about it and seemed ok so as I told them about the world. I got to the part about their characters and Sam got upset and started yelling at me telling me I had no right to use Jeff's character like that.  That I was stomping all over the memory of our friend.  I was stunned and didn't say anything before Sam turned and left my house.  Andrew and I talked for a bit afterwards and he said he didn't think it was wrong that I used the character, but that I should have just not brought up our old characters to Sam.  I think I agree, but I'm still a little unsure which makes me feel even worse.

We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?
A few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis).

So my [19M] parents kicked me out two years ago. There was blame on both sides there, and it is what it is. One of their conditions after kicking me out was that I wasn't allowed to speak to or see my younger sisters [17, 14 and 5] any more. Of course I was upset by that, but I did break one of their rules and I couldn't think of a lot of things that I could do in order to circumvent that condition without making things worse for everyone so I kind of made my peace with it and tried my best to move on. 

I recently started having a little secret contact with my eldest sister via Facebook. Our middle sister, the 14yo, is something of an aspiring stage actress and she recently landed a role as Nancy in her theatre group's performance of Oliver! It's her first big leading role, and I'm insanely proud of her for getting it. She's apparently asked our parents if I'll be there and they just wouldn't talk to her about it. 

I really want to go along and show my support for her. My plan is to sit somewhere inconspicuous and slip out at the end hopefully unnoticed. I'm still figuring out how I'd let her know I was there (current plan is just have the oldest sister tell her). However, I'm apprehensive. I know if I go and my parents spot me/find out there'll be hell to pay. God knows what kind of trouble I'll be in, but I'm more concerned that it'll also get my sisters in trouble - the oldest for speaking to me and the middle for asking about me more than the once - and I really really don't want that. I'm just completely torn. I really want to support my little sister, and I know the chance of my parents seeing me in a large packed theatre is slim, but it's still a chance all the same.

My husband and I had been trying to a baby before my mom even passed. I wanted her to know she was a grandmother before she passed. Needless to say I never got pregnant.

Both of my brothers start saying things that make me feel bad for even trying. The 23yo has severe anxiety and depression from the death of my parents (he was my moms caregiver and gave our dad CPR when he collapsed). He says that a baby would stress him out and we need to wait until our younger brother is 18 to start having kids. He doesn’t want us to have them in the house.

A few weeks later my cousin drunkenly hooked up with her. He told me about it thinking it would be cool to hook up with the same chick. Normally that would've been fine but I actually liked her. So I told him how I felt and asked if he didn't continue pursuing her. He agreed and I thought that was it. A few months later I find out he did continue talking to her and they're now dating.  Now I no longer like her like that but I feel betrayed by my cousin. I opened up to him and he completely disregarded what we talked about. We haven't really talked since and on thanksgiving he texted me saying how thankful he is for me and how I'm like a brother to him. I didn't answer and thought that family would respect each other, unlike what I felt he did.

Am I the asshole for not responding and considering not talking to him anymore?. Am I the asshole?","ESH 

You can feel how you feel but so can he. If he’s dating this girl he clearly likes her, and you asking him not to pursue someone you didn’t care enough about to keep dating when you moved away is kind of greedy. You may say you liked her, but you didn’t like her enough to make it serious despite some tougher circumstances. He goes to the same Uni as you and he’s making it work, so clearly he likes her more than you did. 

And besides, she’s not your property. She can choose to date who she wants you trying to limit that choice for her because he’s your cousin is kind of dickish. You said you don’t have feelings for her anymore. Cool. Move on. Don’t stop talking to family over something this trivial.

My dad has always tracked me through the Find iPhone app, but I never thought much of it until I actually started to do stuff outside of the house a few months ago. I don't do stuff that he wouldn't approve of (that often), but it still feels a little bit overbearing when I get home and sometimes he knows exactly where I've been.

I sort of forced the issue a while ago by creating my own Apple account (I had always used his in the past because of app purchases I didn't want to give up, etc.) and he almost immediately noticed and made me join his Apple Family or whatever it's called. I didn't put up much of a fight since I didn't really feel it was worth it at the time, however now I can barely leave the house without feeling like he is looking over my shoulder. He told me that despite me being an adult, while I still live in his house, he will be tracking my phone, so that if something happens to me or my phone they'll be able to help quicker. I appreciate his concern if it's genuine, but I don't feel like that's a valid reason to be actively monitoring me whenever I leave the house, so I'm wondering WIBTA for pushing this issue further.

My boyfriend and I have moved to a new city together so he can start his PhD. We've moved into a 2 bedroom house with just ourselves.

I have 2 rabbits that I love unconditionally and now winter is setting in in the UK, darker days etc. I've found my rabbits can't play outside in their enclosure as much.

I've asked my boyfriend whether he would mind if I set up an enclosure area in the front room. They won't be free roaming, it's all enclosed and the bunnies won't be able to get to any of our furniture. They're also toilet trained so they poop in a tray so very easy to clean.

We have a young daughter, 5yo, who also loved the dog. Growing up I've always had dogs, and when one passed, there was never a period of more than a week when my parents got the family a new one. My dog who passed was the first dog I had complete responsibility over, so four weeks of no dog really hurt. I'm looking to get a new dog for my family.

My mother in law got wind of our situation and decided to surprise us with a new dog. No one was aware of what was going on until she came to visit one day with puppy in tow. It's a chihuahua-yorkie mix, a very tiny dog, and apparently she spent around $1100 for it. She said this was our Christmas gift from her to our family.

I refuse to let the dog stay with us. It undermines the entire process of me finding a new dog.

She's extremely depressing, and can be very.....oblivious when it comes to observing people's moods.

Y took this to say, ""Ooh look at the couple, couple of the yeeeaarrr"" which caused our president to snap and say ""Fuck off. Really. Fuck off"" Y was a bit taken aback and apologized several times. That's fine and all, and I ordered the president to take her issues outside. However, Y decided to explain the situation, repetitively, to people who had no business knowing about the issue.

I’m really on the fence on this one and I would love to hear opinions on both sides. 

I’ve been looking into getting tear trough fillers for a while. For those who don’t know, these are temporary fillers that last 12-14 months. I would be getting them in my under eye hollows, where you usually get those ‘undereye bags’. 

This area is something I’m pretty self concious about. I have very deep hollows, to the point where when I smile in photos my eyes are kind of swallowed up by them.  Fillers in this area are super effective, and my thinking is that while I already like the way I look, I would want to try out filling them and looking my best. 

The problem is that I think I’ve internalized a lot of shame (and maybe some misogyny) about ‘plastic surgery’, or just altering one’s appearance for vanity. I feel guilty for even considering this, even though I would support anyone else making the decision for themselves. 

Because of these feelings, I kind of want to get the fillers and just not tell anyone. I’m doing it for me, and I don’t want the judgement of my family or friends. It’s hard to think of telling my boyfriend because I know he would hit me with a talk about how I’m beautiful as I am, I don’t need it, I shouldn’t be spending money on it, etc. Even though I know that he would ultimately be supportive, I just don’t want to go through the conversation.

&#x200B;

This teacher is new,this is her first year that she teaches in our school, and the way she handles the works that she makes us do is really bad.

&#x200B;

Her Subject is  technical drawing,basically drawing complicated geometrical stuff.

&#x200B;

We only see this teacher 3 hours during the week, one 1 hour lesson and another 2 hour lesson,though it's not really 3 hours because she always comes in late and doesn't make us do anything for almost 30 minutes and then gets agry because we aren't doing anything.

&#x200B;

So what's my problem with her?

 Basically, in the limited time span that i have to complete my drawings they either come out really bad and unclean or i just don't have enough time to finish them,now you might be asking why i don't do the drawings at home,which is reasonable, but unfortunately this professor collects the work at the end of the lesson and takes it with her, while also signing it.so i cannot do a copy at home, and also when you ask a question during class she always gives you some cryptic answers that you don't understand, like lady, i only have 30 mins left just give me the answer!

She also changes some aspects of the drawing about 50ish minutes into the lesson everytime,for example let's say that we have a pyramid that is 6 cm tall,guess what, now it's 5 and you gotta do all the work that you just did again.

&#x200B;

So last Saturday when she told the class that ""you are slow, the drawings are so easy, why can't you finish them here?"" i snapped, i told her that she can't expect us all to be able to draw that fast whilst changing parts of the drawing every 5 minutes, i also told her that not making us finish our drawings at home is stupid. She responded with ""OP i'm gonna give you a disciplinary note!"" and i just said ""oh thanks"" with a sarcast note,she just called out my name and i just said ""what the fuck do you want?"" and yeah i admit it was rude to talk to her like that but i was just angry with her honestly.

&#x200B;

So today the disciplinary note went into effect and my father called me saying that he didn't want a son like that and that i wasn't his anymore and talking shit about me and my mother while telling me to ""think of a punishment to give yourself"" ,because he's too lazy to do it himself i guess.

37555,"WIBTA if I told this kid in perc he needs to put on deodorant and not wear the same clothes 2 days in a row cus it smells. Hi all,

So I play synthesizer in perc this year for marching season (I did last year), and while I don’t necessarily like it (I hate it actually, I miss my clarinet), they (the band directors) made me do it since I had back surgery last year and didn’t march and this year’s show has a lot of body so they were just watching out for me. Anyways there’s this one kid named Mario and he smells really bad sometimes. He’s a really great percussion mallet player (1st chair at all state lions band). But I notice sometimes he wears the same clothes 2 days in a row, which I think is unhygienic. Also, he kinda smells sometimes, and other people have commented on that before I think. Yesterday, I smelt something really bad and realized it was Mario. I wanted to say something but I don’t know if i should remind him to put on deodorant. Now, I get some people may wear the same clothes twice in a row because they don’t have or can’t afford a lot of clothes, but Mario is certainly not poor. He has a whole marimba in his room at home. And he has plenty of clothes, so I don’t see the need for him to wear the same clothes today as he did the day before. That’s just fucking gross. Also, he should put on deodorant too, cus he kinda stinks sometimes. And I think his hair could use a wash or a combing, cus every time I see him it’s always very messy. So WIBTA if I told him he needs to have personal hygiene?

EDIT: he also might say something like “oh deodorant is for wimps” if I told him cus one time me and some other kids were putting on sunscreen before practice when it was hot and he said “Sunscreen is for wimps.”. Am I the asshole?","ESH He should take more care if his hygiene, but you could be more subtle. 

Poor personal hygiene is often a sign of depression or things going wrong at home. You should raise it with him, but be kind. Tell him you really admire his talent. Tell him you aren't trying to be cruel, but as a friend you want him to know he can be a bit smelly at times and that maybe more people could see what a great guy he is if he took a bit more pride in his appearance.  Maybe start by asking if everything is okay at home.

If you don't feel you can tell him yourself, or you are worried about him talk to a teacher and tell them you're concerned and finding it hard to work with him.

It's a really sensitive issue. If you deal with it well you are doing him a favour, but it could be really hurtful if you are negative and judgemental.

77406,"AITA for trying to help my partner cook?. Hey reddit,

So a little background: me and my Girlfriend get along well, and have only had one very tame argument in over a year. In general, we get along well and I love her.

I have a lot of experience cooking, having cooked proper meals for myself since I was 12, and working in a restaurant. I'm now in my mid 20s. Both me and my partner enjoy cooking for each other and she can make some wonderful meals. I don't think she's bad at cooking, and don't want to come off as controlling so I try my best to keep out of it when she cooks.

The problem stems from when she cooks meat. For example with steaks, she doesn't heat up the pan ready, and puts it on the hob cold inside the pan. I try to be polite and advise her it would be better if she heated the pan up first on full heat to sear the meat. The steak comes out soggy, and the chicken turns out dry. I've tried to advise her politely - and usually I just try to let her do her thing - but today we had a small conflict. I questioned why she doesn't trust my opinion, and the opinion of many chefs, but she said she just wants to do her own thing. That's fine, but I feel like if I've paid for the meat, she should consider my input.

As polite as I tried to be, she was stubborn saying she's cooked it like this all her life and doesn't want to change it. I felt like if I carried on,  it would have seemed controlling, so we let it go. We're currently not talking, and I'm about to go give her a hug and explain it doesn't matter too much.

But, could I get you opinion? Am I the asshole?

How can I deal with this to make it work, combining mine and her cooking? I would really like her to understand why it's good to cook certain ways without coming across like a dick.

&#x200B;

Edit: Seems like there's plenty people with differing opinions about cooking meat, down-voting each other. I don't think that's the point of this thread, let's appreciate that we all have different taste preferences

Me and my partner worked things out.

I came to her and said nicely ""we don't have to argue about this, it's just food :) you can cook how you want and we will take it in turns to cook for each other""

she ended up cooking today, and doing it the way I suggested. it turned out amazing! I'm going to work on my approach, I don't want her to feel like I'm saying she cooks wrong.. Am I the asshole?","NAH.

It may simply come down to the two of you having different tastes. Have you considered that, as “wrong” as her cooking methods are, she actually likes soggy chicken? The best way around this might be for you to either take turns cooking (say, you cook meals MWF and Sunday, and she cooks the other days), or you cooking your own separate meal.

I really relate to your post because my husband, whom I love dearly, can’t cook for sh!t and has...interesting taste. He loves his scrambled eggs so dry his grandmother calls it “popcorn,” his bacon cooked until it resembles charcoal, his meat extremely well done, and puts bbq sauce on everything. Yes. **Everything.** For the sake of our marriage, I’ve let this go. When I cook steak, I take mine off the cast iron skillet once the thermometer reads 130 degrees, and leaves his on until it reads 160 degrees at least, give him log cabin instead of maple syrup with our pancakes, and leave the bacon on until it turns a gorgeous charcoal. I make myself pizza from scratch and pop his Stouffer’s in the oven and eat my homemade chocolate mousse while he enjoys his Whoppers.

69533,"AITA for leaving a $7 tip on a $140 dinner bill?. I had some older relatives visiting from overseas and decided to order delivery for their last night in the United States. We opted for a pricier Japanese restaurant and ended up with a check around $143 for five large platters of sushi. When prompted online to tip the driver, I decided to simply round up to $150 because I didn’t think that driver tips were supposed to scale with the price of the food. We ordered relatively little food by volume, and sure enough, our food arrived in a fairly standard sized paper takeout bag. 

Nonetheless, our courier confronted me and asked for “the rest of the tip.” I explained that I placed the tip online rather than in person, but he complained that it was “less than 5%” and that most people tip at least 15% on “such a large order.” Despite his disdain, I wasn’t going to give him $20+ for delivering a single bag that would typically contain $20 of food, so I just apologized and said that I don’t have any cash.

I'm in the habit of not always answering text/whatsapp messages that I receive right away. Not that I wait a week before responding, but a few hours is common. Sometimes it's simply because I did not notice the messages, as I don't check my phone every five minutes and the sound usually is turned off.

I don't want to feel forced to give people attention and get in a conversation right away whenever someone feels like sending me a message.

I would like to say she does not find it disgusting to kiss me but nor does she find it enjoyable, she simply is neutral on the matter but leans more towards preferring not to. We have discussed this a couple times and eventually came to an agreement to where we would do some things in moderation due to me viewing physical attraction as a very necessary element of a relationship.

I want to make it clear that I explicitly said multiple times that she has the right to say no or the right to push me away if she doesn’t feel comfortable, I also said that my main priority is her feeling safe, I never want her to feel like I’ve broken our trust. I iterated multiple times some boundaries I’d like to set such as us having to discuss anything involving any clothes off shenanigans and also some boundaries around both of us being accepting of one of us seems very physically distant or if one of us seems to get a little too close sometimes.

The surgery is scheduled and happening soon. Right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

Between this illness and life in general, Sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger.

So it really helped, and now I feel my room is my own place to get away from stuff when I’m feeling overwhelmed.

44360,"AITA for calling my adult daughter ungrateful?. My daughter and I have never been close because our personalities just don’t mesh very well together. I always strived to raise her to be independent and successful especially since her father was not always there to help raise her. We fought during her last years in my house as I didn’t approve of her choice to waste money travelling to a big city to pursue a degree of little use when our local campus had much more solid courses. In the end she left me at 18 to go God knows where and we didn’t speak at all after that.

Today we reunited for my sister’s funeral and I was very annoyed at my daughter’s disrespectful attitude. I understand her being distant but I was the one that had to approach and greet her. She only gave me one worded answers and didn’t sit next to me during the funeral service. She was unwilling to put aside pettiness in order to act appropriately during this event for my sister's memory and this hurt and angered me deeply.

During the wake I confronted her outside of the building about her attitude only to be rudely rebuffed. She told me that I was never supportive and that I had no right to tell her how her conduct was affecting me. I was extremely hurt in her insinuation that she didn’t receive support for me. I sacrificed everything to give her a quality education and I did everything I could to give her a stable home life. Her father and I stayed together purely because we were thinking of her wellbeing. I sacrificed a lot of time to make sure that she was always on track with her studies and employment so that she would have the best possible start to life. I told her everything I did for her and said that it was she that was unsupportive of me and ungrateful for everything that I’ve done for her. She swore at me and left to go back inside. 

I’ve been told by my older sister that I handled this poorly and that I shouldn’t have confronted my daughter during the wake in public, even though I didn’t do this in front of any witnesses. I do acknowledge that I shouldn't have been so emotional so quickly but I also think that it was my daughter who decided to make this public in the first place with her conduct during the funeral.

Just want to preface this by saying my Mom’s on going cancer battle has killed quite a bit of the empathy I used to have, it’s been emotionally draining, and may have thrown my perspective on my girlfriend’s situation. 

My (29M) girlfriend (27) is from Southeast Asia, came to the US on a visa, and got a job at an apparel startup. I met her about a month before her visa expired and she had been in contact with an immigration lawyer trying to get her into the H-1B lottery. The immigration lawyer botched the paperwork and missed the application deadline. She didn’t leave before the deadline and wouldn’t be able to re-enter the US for 3 years, which I didn’t think was so bad considering if she overstayed an additional 6 months, she wouldn’t be able to re-enter for another 10 years. She said even 3 years is too much of a setback and decided not to go back to her home country. She has been continuing to work at the startup, while also working on launching her own apparel business, already putting production orders in. Her boss has let her know that after year-end he will no longer keep her on as an independent contractor and must be on payroll, which she can now only do if she marries a US citizen. She has also hit roadblocks in setting her business up due to her immigration status. At this point the 6 month window has also passed, so if she leaves now she won’t be able to re-enter for 10 years. 

I have been dating her for 10 months now and about two weeks ago she started really pressuring me on getting married, which I’ve said is something that I’m not ready for right now. She says that getting married can solve all of her problems and has likened me to someone who has the cure for cancer and won’t give it to someone they love, which seems like her just trying to relate her situation to my Mom’s. She says that I’m the most selfish person she has ever met and that I’ve ruined her life. I don’t want to get married just to solve a problem, I want to get married because I am certain want that person in my life forever. In these past 10 months I haven’t spent enough time with her to know that, so I’m not willing to get married to her.

The high school I (F23) went to lasted five years, three that we spent in boarding house and two that we lived in flats close to the school building. That made me and my 32 class mates grow really close and we meet up multiple times a year and whenever one of us has a big life event happening, like weddings. And even though I'm not totally close with all of them, I love them all to death, well, with one exception.

She's a huge narcissist, which is a trait I hate. Maybe I was a bit jealous about all the attention she got, maybe our personalities were just too different, idk, but I spent the majority of our five school years together by ignoring her. It was fine, we still got along okay. But in our fourth year we did a school project and she was the project manager. I don't want to get into too much detail but she loved being the center of attention and was constantly making mountains out of molehills. With one of these mountains she shouted at and embarrassed me in front of the whole class and three teachers. I left school early that day to cry. In the afternoon she sent me a message saying ""everything cleared :)))"". Til this day I have not received an apology. I do not want this girl who has never been kind to me unless it pleased her at my wedding. 

I talked to a friend from class the other day about planning to not invite her and I was told it would be really unfair and asshole-ish, because it would show her and everyone else that I didn't want HER there specifically.

43913,"AITA for not being in my biological father's life when he wanted to be in mine?. A little backstory. He gave up his rights when I got adopted by my stepdad. After my mom and my adopted dad (Dave) were divorced, I got curious and wanted to meet him so my Mom introduced to me to him (Steve).

It was just after my 13th birthday when I met him and while he gave me a bunch of tiger and lion stuff, I felt let down then since I had such an image of him in my mind. 

I was adopted at around 8 years old. Steve hadn't been in my life until I first met him. I had a few father figures I don't remember and some I did until I was adopted. 

Steve and I broke apart off and on until I realized I was done having a father figure. Dave had hypnotized me, I had a godfather, a stepdad, and a guy who treated me like his son. 

I'm not confrontational with these sorts of things. I tried a passive approach. Ignoring texts and phone calls. I one time broke my phone on purpose just so I'd get a new number. 

While Steve was always trying to be in my life, I didn't want to be in his. His family was trying to push my religion to Christianity and they always made it seem like I had no future.

EDIT: got online some INFO


Look, I'm an Indian who has lived in the US for most of his life. My diet is mostly western, although I do cook the occasional masala or curry dish. During college, my group of friends always had a few Indian-Americans in it, in addition to the usual assortment of white people, black people, Asians, and Latinos.

We ate the same food, and usually showered around the same time since we had similar classes and played the same sports together, and I can say without reservation that the Indians always smelled the worst, quickest, even when all of us were wearing deodorant and after we had showered. (the one exception was a lone white friend who usually ate the worst possible shit you could imagine, never went to class, and occasionally went a few days without showering or brushing). And since we all lived together or near each other, I know everyone usually wore deodorant.


The general smelliness chart of races goes something like this, in order:

Indians
Blacks
Latinos
Whites
Asians

I don't think the hair is the issue either. Out of the Indians, we had varying degrees of hair, but we all smelled roughly the same together.

I will say that when we cooked or ate Indian food, the Indians got smellier even faster, so the other points about Indian food making you smell are not totally off-base.

General notes:

I think whites and Asians are pretty close on this list in terms of smell, and I have known Asians more pungent than most whites.

Blacks have less ""range"" in their smell, but they can be a bit sharper than Indians if circumstances are right.. Am I the asshole?","YTA for generalizing, NTA for moving if someone smells.",1,1,0,0,0

32332,"AITA for letting my coworker/friend think he’s ugly?. Saw a recent Reddit post that made me think about my actions and created a throwaway to ask.

I’ve been good friends with one of my coworkers for years. He’s 33, well-liked, and an all-around good guy. We get along well, have similar interests/hobbies, and often hang out as couples (my fiancé and I with him and his wife), so I know him pretty well, and know that he is generally a confident guy.

But he has this one hang up: he thinks he’s decidedly ugly. I’m pretty sure the idea solidified for him in high school, long before I knew him, and just stuck. And as confident as he seems, I know it bothers him, because he periodically brings it up in off-hand ways.

Here’s where I may be an asshole: I never address it when he brings it up. Even the few times he has just straight up said he’s ugly, I just change the subject. And I’m pretty sure he takes it as meaning that I agree - I know he thinks i’m an objectively pretty girl (guys have hit on me in front of him, and he then always says laughingly that we have had very different life experiences), and that he always felt ignored by pretty girls in high school because according to him “he’s ugly.” So I think it reaffirms those feelings when I refuse to respond to what are, probably, veiled requests for validation.

Here’s where I might really be the asshole: he isn’t ugly. I have no idea if he was in high school (never seen a photo), but while he isn’t movie-star  handsome, he’s not bad looking at all. So if he was ugly as a kid, he grew into it.

The reason I don’t just say, “you’re not ugly,” is that I have a general rule against commenting on the appearance of any men at my office. I have experienced sexual harassment there before (it’s a large office), and have also had issues in school and work where men always seem to take my being polite as interest. And I’m super non-confrontational, so I hate it.

So as a general rule, I avoid any kind of physical contact, do not comment on appearance, and will not attend any outing with a male coworker unless others or present or my fiancé is there (with the exception of normal daytime things like work coffees, meetings, or lunches). I have found these practices helpful, so I stick to them, but I also feel like a bit of a dick in this instance, as my friend is not a concern in that regard and I know my avoidance of the issue probably seems like confirmation. AITA for not simply saying, “you’re not ugly,” when it’s clearly an esteem issue for him?. Am I the asshole?",NTA.

She posted that the puppy ""had been adopted"" ten minutes later. I am head over heels in love with this sweet baby girl already, but I am currently living with my mom and she said absolutely no way.

43095,"AITA for complaining to my roommate about her dad visiting?. My roommate and I moved across the country this past July. We settled into a one bedroom apartment because of convenience/ timing and the nature of my roommates (RM) job at the time. Originally, RM was going to be away for months at a time. When she would be back home, I would sleep in our living room so she could have much needed privacy. Her job would have had her on a boat surrounded by people constantly.

That job fell through and we had already signed a lease for a one bedroom so right now I sleep on a mattress in the corner of the living room. We are both making this work and it's not too bad.

RM's dad wants to fly over here to visit for a week. This I wouldn't have any issues with except he wants to stay with us... in our one bedroom apartment... which we still haven't really furnished...

I think it is kind of rude to visit right now because we are still getting really settled in. RM is still looking for a job and we will both be busy during the week he wants to visit. This whole plan was made by him two days ago and he plans on visiting in two weeks. We only have two beds, no couch and nothing really saved up to buy extra furniture at this time. 

I complained to RM about how inconvienent it is and she seemed upset about my reaction. She is very close to her family and was sad about not getting to spend the holidays with then this year. I am pretty distant with my family and will rarely spend holidays with mine. 

Overall, I think RM's dad is being inconsiderate to our current situation and he should either postpone his trip or get a hotel room.

 He's a typical manipulative cunt who does anything for his best interests. The host of the houseparty; got bullied by him for over 3 years.

I was not cool with inviting him to a party we got so hyped about. I expressed my feelings about the situation and my group of close friends had been thinking the same. The planning of the party is done; we decide not to invite him to our little party.

Now here's the first fuckup; this guy has two other close friends in our class. We love hanging out with them, but not him. So we thought ""hey if we're not inviting him, it would be stupid to invite his close friends"". So we finalized our planning and decided not to invite any of them.

Now, the second fuckup is ; the big-mouthed degenerate that I am, decided to tell the manipulative guy's friend about the party. And what do you know , he found out about it and was a massive bitch about it. He never publically spoke to us, but we knew he was devestated because he thought that we considered him as a friend and got heart-broken because we didn't invite him.

Time goes on and it's the day of the party. We finish class , get ready for the party and allll that. 

The party was pretty neat ; Music, Alcohol, Friends, Girls and all that good stuff.

My husband thinks switching off every year is fair, but I think when you take the situation as a whole it makes more sense for my family to have Christmas Day, as we don’t see them as often. AITA here?. Am I the asshole?","YTA.  However, the simple solution for this is to have Christmas at your house.  The grandparents can all come to you, starting now.",1,1,0,0,0
67710,"AITA for not wanting family members babysitting my kid?. Wife and I had a baby last year and luckily we have been able to balance out everything so that we didn't have the need to leave him with someone. Now that he's older my wife wants to go back to her workplace (she has been working from home) and the subject of a daycare and babysitters came up. This is fine by me as I want to have a professional taking care of our kid.

The problem came up while we were planning a budget for it. Since we want to have some time for ourselves like date nights and such I thought we could set up some money aside to get a babysitter on those occasions. My wife on the other hand said that we could save some money if we asked our relatives if they could take him before getting a babysitter. This was prompted due to the many offers that both her family and my family have already made in the past.

I voiced my concern with this because as I said before I would feel more comfortable leaving my kids with someone who is a professional and has good work ethic. I do not agree with many of the choices that our family members make and I know that they would ignore our recommendations and do things their own way which granted, could have no influence but also could and I don't want to toss a coin at my kid's expense. My family has issues that I know very well myself and so does my wife's family. I said all of this to her.

My wife took offense of what I said, she says I'm dismissing her opinions on parenting and that I pretty much called her a bad mother for wanting our son to interact with our family. She also says I'm being too judgemental, that I'm not being fair and that it's not good for our son to grow up like this.

INFO: My parents have an unhealthy relationship between themselves, they say they have an open marriage and that they're respectful of each others choices but go on to argue every day because of said choices. Not only I do not approve of their lifestyle I also do not approve that they bring their partners around their house. My sister who has also volunteered in the past has declared herself the ""cool crazy aunt"" and refused to elaborate when asked about what it means. Overall she's irresponsible and pays no attention to what we ask of her. 

On my wife's side, her parents are too overbearing and act like they know everything. They ignore people's opinions and criticize our parenting because ""they had 4 kids and they know more than we do"". My sister in law is divorced and has 2 kids herself already, my brothers in law are married but have no kids themselves and no experience either. One of them does not want to have kids himself at all.. Am I the asshole?","YTA for issuing a blanket edict that no family members are able to babysit.

So I was having a conversation with my mom about a friend of mine who got into a car accident (nothing serious just a scratched bumper and fender) and how he exchanged numbers with the guy he hit but the number he gave was off by one number. Fast forward he’s calling insurance to pay for damages and he hopes that the guy (or the police) he hit doesnt come looking for him and the reason hes going to give to the insurance company is he hit some barrier by accident or damaged the car himself.

So I asked my mom “Hey isnt that insurance fraud?” and my mom says that’s being “street smart” so you avoid all that paperwork and bureuacracy and you dont waste time on further investigation (stuff kinda moves slow in my country but if you want things to go fast you have to get involved in corruption and deception). So I got angry at her and asked if she was telling me that I should straightup lie to insurance companies when I have a claim. She responds by saying “Ok fine you try doing it the right way and see how that works for you, you’ll waste tons of time and deal with red tape” she then tells me in the rare instances that she had to claim insurance she either stretched the truth of what happened or she lied to the company in order to get the money.

There are four people in the story, we’ll call them Johnny, Brett, Sam, and me. Johnny and Brett didn’t do anything too serious, but they do have a roll in the story. Sam is the one who was recording me.

The story begins with the four of us playing video games together. Like, a lot. We played almost everyday, and I thought my information was secure with them. Turns out, it wasn’t. Sam was saving every single bit of audio we had together and showing it to people. He even said that he was uploading it, which he later said was a joke, but I think that was just damage repair. So he was invading my privacy as far as I see it, but he sees it differently. Anyways, I blocked communication with him and didn’t speak with him for a year or two. Johnny and Brett pressured me to get over it and become friends with him, despite my anger. I eventually had to cut them all off because the constant peer pressure from Johnny and Brett and the verbal insults that started coming from Sam (I insulted him back when he did this, but he ended up crying once, so I thought it best to just stop all communication). Today I had to get a paper from him because we were put into a group in class, and he brought up the situation in a sort of “remember the time? That was so funny!” Kind of way. I got the paper and left. So my question is, AITA for cutting someone off for recording me? Am I just being melodramatic?

8382,"AITA for not wanting an untrained ESA in my workspace?. I'm a new grad student. Today one of my deskmates brought her emotional support dog into our studio workspace. I asked her about it and she told me it was an anxiety dog, which is a little ironic because dogs give me major anxiety, although I can work with it if it's a well-trained service dog and stays away from me.

This dog was not well trained. It whined loudly the entire time it was there, wouldn't sit still, and barked whenever anybody entered the room. It was distracting and the barking really freaked me out. I wound up needing to move to a table across the room, which helped a bit but isn't typically an option.

I emailed my professor asking for clarification and he told me he would find out for me.

I would be really relieved to have this dog out of the workspace, but otoh I feel bad being so afraid of and distracted by this girl's anxiety support dog, which obviously she must feel she needs or she wouldn't bring it with her. Should I try harder to adjust to the animal? AITA for wanting it out of the class environment?. Am I the asshole?","Definitely not an asshole.

Her rights end where yours begin. Or more kindly, because she's not an asshole either, your anxiety is just as important as hers. 

An emotional support dog that has not been trained and certified is not legally required to be allowed to enter any places that would otherwise prohibit animals, but you are being very reasonable considering her anxiety too. They aren't required to be allowed specifically for the reasons you explained, they can be a major distraction, and even a risk to other people without training. I don't think you'd be an asshole for asking that she doesn't dig the dog. I wouldn't be if I asked for that because I have asthma. Anxiety is just as real. Our health is as important as hers and if the dog was medically necessary, a doctor would be certifying this so.

We rarely have a conversation about anything other than what I plan to do this weekend or if I have plans. 

I’ve told her multiple times I don’t like when she says things like that/ that it makes me upset. I have also told her my reasoning for staying home most weekends, but she just doesn’t stop.

I really understand your need to just chill by yourself. You're in a noisy, demanding, chaotic environment all day and you need to recharge. And you may just be the kind of person who appreciates solitude more than partying. 

I understand where your mom could be coming from, too. At a lighter end, she could be worried you're missing out on the fun you ""should"" be having at your age. She wants you to be happy and with a good network of friends. Getting a bit more serious, she could be wondering if your seeming lack of a social life is an indication of something else. She could be genuinely worried you're depressed or suicidal and not telling her. I know that will sound like a huge leap to some, but parents are often told about teenage suicide and how little the parent knew ahead of time and that we have to be constantly vigilant, etc. A couple of the ""signs your teen could be depressed"" are staying in their room a lot, not going out with friends anymore, etc. Even if one isn't prone to panic, it can make us a little apprehensive. Nobody wants to miss those signs. 

So have a talk with her. Listen to her concerns and what she wants. Tell her your needs. There may well be an easy solution that makes both of you happy. You might even find out really useful things about each other.

It was obviously posted by him, it was for the same house. And it skeeved me out. In the write-up he said ""women only"" and that he was looking to be housemates with ""either a college student or young professional with a compatible lifestyle"" 

And then he wrote a lot about himself, in a way that made it sound like a dating profile. I don't want to quote it all because of anonymity, but he talked about how he's nice and chivalrous and courteous, and he wants to ""cultivate a homey atmosphere"" 

Anyway it read more like he was looking for a girlfriend than a roommate, I texted him right away saying that I saw his Craigslist posting and I was sorry but I didn't think we'd work as roommates.

He asked why, and I said that I noticed he was looking for women his age only, was looking for a close personality fit, and that his post read as too personal for me. I'm looking for a roommate situation where we mind our own business and aren't too personal.

My full reason was that it skeeved me out he was looking for young women only, it felt like he expected more than a roommate. But I was trying to be a little more polite than that because I know he's a friend of a coworker and I didn't want problems at work.

Anyway, he got mad, said he needed a roommate soon and that he'd stopped considering other options for a month and a half because I was planning on signing a sublet. But now he was stuck paying twice the rent the next month and the coming months.

I suggested maybe he post a less restrictive ad if he was looking for a roommate quickly.

He then blocked me on Facebook, which was where we'd been messaging.

In the contract it clearly states that no smoking is permitted and neither myself nor my husband are smokers. I invited my brother’s partner only after multiple reassurances that he would not smoke. The only reason i have a dilemma is because the partner is confined to a wheelchair due to his brain cancer and smoking is one of the few pleasures he has left. Am i being selfish for asking him to stop for a few days?

When we got back, she told my SIL about it.

For the past week it’s been finding its way out of their yard and running around the neighborhood. The first couple of days they were into finding the dog, but now it seems like they don’t give a shit. The dog has been limping, and it never has a collar on. This has been going on for a little more than a week kind you. 

So, today the dog got out again. I was walking my dog and she seemed interested in her so I kinda coaxed the dog back into their yard. I knocked on the door to let them know that their dog had gotten out again; no answer. I go to the other door and ring the doorbell. While I’m waiting for them to hopefully answer the door the dog gets out AGAIN. I go over to yet another door (had no idea that one house could have so many fucking doors that lead to outside) and I notice the windows are open. They heard me calling the dog and everything but decided to not do anything about it. I ring the doorbell; nothing. I knock; nothing. I ring the doorbell once again, I hear a baby cry in the room where the windows are open (which is right next to the door), and I hear the owner of the dog say “son of a bitch”, she quiets the baby, AND STILL DOESN’T COME TO THE FUCKING DOOR! I feel it’s important to share that she’s not alone in the home. Her mom also lives in the house and they both don’t work. I stood there and said “is this a joke?” And still, not even a “go fuck your self”. Just silence. Since this has been going on all week, and I’m truly worried for the dogs safety I called the local police department. One unit shows up, lights off, and they’re talking to me to get my side of the story. Low and behold, I finally see the lady poke her head out of the door, and she sees me talking to the police officer. She immediately shuts the door and I honestly have no idea what happened after that. They asked me if I wanted to file a complaint, and I said no because I do t want to start a neighbor war. I just want them to take care of their dog. Where we live is kind of secluded. She knows who I am, and I know who she is. I can’t help but feel guilty. Was my reaction too much? AITA?

Btw, the dog is still at large.. Am I the asshole?","NTA. Clear case of animal neglect on the owners part. It’s obvious they don’t want the dog anymore and were hoping it would run away or get hit by a car or something.

73794,"WIBTA if I confronted my Aunt about the terrible Christmas presents she gets me?. So every year for the past 3 years my Aunt has got me a quite clearly fake Pandora charm. Usually she gets me something else little to go with it, like a mug or pair of cute earrings so I usually don't mind and I just get rid of the charm. Last year she got me a charm and I asked my Mum if she'd let my Aunt know I don't really need any charms anymore as my bracelet is pretty full anyway and that she doesn't need to get me anything really for Christmas as I'm 21 at this point so I don't really expect anything.

About 4 weeks ago she'd asked my Mum what my sister and I would like for Xmas, my sister said she'd like something from the Body Shop and I'd said just a voucher towards a meal with my boyfriend. We present swapped with them yesterday and this morning I had a peak in the bag wondering what she'd got. I spotted a small box for me and at this point I knew what it was. I opened it and of course it's a fake Pandora charm. From feeling my sisters present, I'm pretty certain she got some shower gels from the Body Shop - so she has spent about £10 on my sister, meaning my Pandora charm (meant to be upwards of £30) is clearly not genuine. 

I'm not necessarily being ungrateful but I don't understand why she got my sister what she wanted, but went out of her way to get me what I didn't want that isn't at all useful for me and ends up in the bin? I really don't mean to sound entitled, I'd rather get nothing than have her spend money on something that's clearly fake. 

So WIBTA if I mentioned to my Aunt over text on Xmas day that it's not genuine and does she have a receipt or something so I could swap it? I'd expect this would prompt her to panic or realise that she's messed up. I'm just a bit tired of getting the same crap over and over, it's disappointing to think oh maybe she got me something useful and it turns out she didn't. I do love her but I have no idea if she knows whether they're fake or not, or if she is doing it on purpose to save money. I do happen to have the real version of the charm she got me so I could say I already have that one and does she have the receipt, or would she be able to return it and get her money back? My Mum and I expect that she got it from a market stall rather than online. And if I wbta then how can I resolve this or at least warn her without being an asshole?. Am I the asshole?",Yta.

49116,"WIBTA for calling DOCS on my ex-wife. I recently left my wife of 5 years due to the fact that I was being treated like shit for nothing, long story but about the usual. We had been split up for some time before because we didn't agree on a lot of parenting concerns, but reconciled and got back together.

When we got together she was in care of her own two children, who are now 8 & 10, and lived in housing accommodation, which was trashed anyway. When we had a daughter together we moved into my mother's as it was a clean house that had plenty of space for everyone to live happily with plenty of space. We then split up the first time it was when we were planning on moving out of my mother's to our own place and I told her that I would move with them when they can keep a house clean (at this point every house we had lived in had gotten trashed and I was the only on to constantly try to clean)

Since then things have only gotten worse. Her two older children from a previous relationship have no sense of right and wrong, or any care for anything, resulting in living in a terribly dirty and generally trashed house. I have spent most of my relationship with them all trying to teach them to be clean and respectful but nothing ever sank in. None of them, including the mother, care, and have always lived in mess.

Now that I have left my ex-wife has only gotten more aggressive and accusatory, and has threaten to try to take our 3yo daughter from me. I already have full care of her, but nothing legal. She has made threats and told me that I won't keep our daughter from her, which I never had planned on doing, up until now.

I don't plan on doing anything to spite anyone, but I love her children just as much as my own and I do worry for them. I worry that their mother will never get the help she needs to care for them properly. I worry that the children will grow up not knowing how to deal with the simplest of things on their own. And I worry that my daughter will have to deal with all of this just for my ex to spite me.

So I'm graduating from community college with my AA degree. Yay me. I'm proud of myself. I survived my first 2 yrs and I'm gonna be goin off to a 4 yr school in the fall. Despite being homeschooled, I had a highschool graduation. It was legit. We had cap and gowns and a whole ceremony that went on for way too long (since there were like only 15-20 of us) and my mom sees it as a real graduation too.

My mom really really wants me to walk across the stage for my community college graduation. To me, I dont think it's a huge deal. Sure when I graduate from my 4 yr school I will definitely partake in the ceremony! But NONE of my friends are doing the ceremony. They're all just gettin sent their diplomas in the mail. 

I know it's not gonna be horrible and that I'll only be on stage for a few minutes jus to take the diploma and walk off (theres not even a rehearsal for this) but I just don't want to do it! To me this makes it even more pointless. I'm literally walking across a stage. It's just not my thing

I've tried to explain this to my mom and how I feel its unnecessary and why cant we just celebrate by ourselves? Every time I've confronted her, she combats me and tries to guilt me back into going thru with it. She even went as far as to say that if I didnt go thru with the ceremony then we're not gonna celebrate me graduating. 

I accomplished something. Sure. Great. But she and I both now that the only reason I'm doing this is because she wants me to. I'm not doing this for me. It's only for her. Shes never cared that I DONT want to do it and all she cares about is that she DOES. 

Shes even not letting me go hang with my friends the night before, because she doesnt want me rushing around in the morning. Something that doesnt affect HER at all. 

I HAVE to go thru with it, she's paid for it and its literally Thursday. I don't want to disappoint her, cuz I feel like I already have enough with all her guilt trips. But I'm literally being MADE to go.

24830,"WIBTA for refusing to vacuum because my boyfriend doesn't want a robot vacuum cleaner?. I asked my boyfriend if he would consider getting a robot vacuum cleaner, he told me no because he thinks it's a waste of money. That's fair. We have a joint bank account in which we both put the same amount of money for rent, groceries, utilities etc. 


So I told him I would be willing to buy it with my personal bank account. Then we spent the whole night arguing that I should be saving money and that it's lazy.


We both work full time and we have a 4 year old daughter. We both clean, cook and wash. It mostly depends on who is home when but I'd say that it's 50/50 on who does what. 


But I hate vacuuming. We have dark grey tiles in our whole house so you can see everything. Every little piece of dust, every lost hair. In order to keep our house completely clean we'd have to vacuum at least once a day. But that's not happening. It happens maybe once a week and I want to vacuum more, but I don't want to do it myself. 


He told me during the argument ""fine then I'll vacuum all the time."" But I know he doesn't mean that and if I'd ask him to vacuum every day he'd get pissed at me. 


And we're not poor. I save €700-€1000 every month so I think there's no way I can save more than €1000 a month. And a robot vacuum cleaner that costs €300 - €500 isn't going to change my financial situation.


I explained all these things to him, but his final judgement still is ""don't be lazy, save money""

It's not my goal to pressure him into buying a robot vacuum cleaner, but I'm pissed that he thinks he can decide what I do with my own money, after all our expenses are paid. So if I ""took him up on his offer"" and never vacuum again but still ask him to every day or 2, WIBTA?. Am I the asshole?","NTA. Tell him each second day.

79275,"AITA for choosing to ignore my friend's hints that she wants to come on vacation with me?. Me(19f) and three of my best friends are planning on going on vacation this year. Last year we went to Greece together and we worked great as a friend group, no fights occured and we got along well. We're currently planning our next vacation to Greece.

I have a childhood friend ""Amy"" (also 19) who isn't part of my regular friend group. Amy and i see each other on a regular basis but she doesn't like parties, bars or hanging out with more than three people at once so usually, it's just me and Amy hanging out alone or we go to a restaurant.

I love Amy and i consider her to be one of my closest friends but she can be quite difficult. Amy's biggest problem is communication. She never outright says what she wants or how she feels and leaves ""hints"" for people to figure out what's going on with her.

For example if Amy wants to hang out she'll text how bored she is, then how lonely and so on. She basically hints at what she wants but doesn't say it out loud and leaves it up to me to figure out what she wants and then ask her, like in my example, if she wants to hang out. Sometimes that gets very frustrating.

Yesterday i met up with Amy and i shortly mentioned that me and my three friends are planning on going on vacation again. Amy then hinted the entire evening that she wants to come with us, even tough she doesn't like my friends.

Some of her hints were ""that vacation sounds like so much fun but i don't have anyone to go on vacation with"" and ""wow i have always wanted to go Greece but i probably won't go anytime soon"" and hints like that. It was hard not asking her because the only nice answer to those questions would be if i asked her if she wanted to come along.

Honestly, i don't want her to come with us. Amy doesn't even like my friends and since we're planning this to be a party vacation i know she won't enjoy herself.

Thus far she hasn't asked me straight up if she can go on vacation with us so i'm choosing to ignore her hints that she wants to come.

Julie has a niece (15F), 'Elise'.Me and Julie smoke weed quite often, and we are quite open about it with her side of the family, who are all quite chill and open minded (mine freaks  if I even drink). I know Julie is very open with Elise especially, offering birth control and such if she wants it (Elise has never accepted). Unbeknowst to me, Julie has also offered to supply weed in the past, although Elise has never accepted before.

Recently, though, Elise approached Julie and asked if she could supply her and some friends (2 or 3) weed. Julie agreed. We were having dinner tonight, and I guess it came up in conversation. I was really shocked that Julie would offer that in the first place, and told her under no conditions was she to give those kids weed. Weed is illegal where I live, and whilst kids caught smoking it get a slap on the wrist, the adults supplying it can get in major trouble - I'm talking fines or jail time. I can't believe that Julie would ever risk earning these just to let her niece have a little buzz. 

She got really mad at me, and told me that she's the best place for them to get it from: she said if they want to smoke weed, then they would find a way to do it no matter the supplier. Because we know our dealer (friends), we know that they don't add synthetics or lace it with anything dangerous. She said that they wouldn't know for sure if any other sources were laced until it was too late. Basically said she was doing it for their own good, because they may end up in serious harm with some random dealer's stuff.

5683,"AITA for being extremely asocial, causing people to dislike me?. So, I have social anxiety, as you may have inferred from the title. It can get pretty bad sometimes. Recently, I joined a partial hospitalization program (PHP) for my depression, suicidal thoughts, self esteem issues, and anxiety.

It's been a rough start. I constantly feel like everyone hates me and no one wants to see my ugly face, so I don't talk a lot of the time. I think that people won't like me because I'm gross and overweight. When people do approach me, I can't seem to hold the conversation. I'm awful at keeping up a chat because I usually give one-word answers, and that's because I'm either not interested in the topic or am deathly afraid of saying the wrong thing. I have a huge fear of screwing up when saying or doing something around others.

All of this makes me quiet, reserved, and atrocious at talking, thus making me not appealing to everyone else in the program. I see people giving me weird looks sometimes when I sit in the academics room while everyone else socializes. And by everyone else, I mean literally everyone else. They all know each other well, but I just can't make the effort to try and talk to them because I hate butting into conversations. That's because I'm terrified of people thinking that I'm annoying.

Basically, I'm not social. I don't talk, I don't participate in discussions, and I definitely don't approach people on my own to try and make friends. It's all due to my overwhelming fear of others disliking me. And I know that people think lowly of me because I overheard two girls whispering about how 'weird' I was. That really got to me, and it still gets to me. But, since I'm too scared to try and change my image, I'm stuck being the weird quiet kid. I honestly feel like a coward, and like I'm putting others down and annoying them by not making any efforts to socialize.

Am I the asshole?. Am I the asshole?","NTA but the way you carry yourself makes it hard for others to connect with you.

  


1. Don't pressure yourself to find a perfect response in a conversation. Easier said from an internet stranger than done, but it's okay to let the conversation flow and stuff and jist listen. If you wanna say something, try, but otherwise sounds like it's okay to let others talk.

  


2. There's two ways to think about the phrase ""people don't care"". You can choose to interpret it as everyone is either disinterested in/disliking you. OR give yourself some slack! Everyone makes mistakes. Heckydecky I sound confident IRL but no way am I 100% perfect or have foresight or living unawkwardly. A lot of times people are their own worst critics and worry about how they're like or act instead of judging others.

Also sometimes labels get in the way. It's okay to notice certain situations are uncomfortable, but to group all these interactions as failures is injustice to you and your life! Try to think of the little achievements you've done so far. From this post alone, this internet stranger is proud of your efforts to reach out (to the program and in this post)! It's a very brave thing and every little step to improvement is improvement. I hope you can pride in your own actions and feel more comfortable opening up to the group.

Joe was incredibly close friends with me and my  boyfriend last summer, hanging out and regularly going to concerts (it was just our thing).  I find out he’s going to study in another country for a while but needs a place to stay before he goes, so I let him crash at my place for a month or two. He finally moves out and goes.

It was difficult to keep in contact, but I tried. A few messages every other week, maybe less. Come to find out when he moves back home about 6 months later, he is cozied up and best friends with an ex boyfriend (who is also in a relationship with an ex friend) and hasn’t said a word to me since he moved back.

I end up finding out Joe’s just been hanging out with ex bf and ex friend constantly. Not a word from him since.

63359,"AITA for telling my mom who snores to go to a doctor?. My mom snores, loudly. It’s gotten worse over the past few years. I dread sharing rooms with her on trips because it means no sleep. She lives in my house and has her own room, but she falls asleep easily and sometimes falls asleep on the couch. If that happens, I can hear her snoring up in my room. She’s tried the strips; they don’t work for her. It’s loud. If we’re in the living room together, she’ll fall asleep in the middle of the movie and again, snore loudly but refuse to go upstairs because “I’m awake, I’m awake!”

I’ve urged her to go to a doctor, she has her own business so she doesn’t need to ask a boss for time off. She also has insurance and can afford the appointment. I used to snore and I had surgery to fix it (got my tonsils and adenoids removed). I’m not even saying she has to have it done, but at least go and do \*something\* about it. It’s so loud to be heard through walls and floors, and I know it can’t be healthy for her, ignoring my own annoyances. Lately, I just bring it up every day and tell her to make an appointment with an ENT or some sort of doctor to just figure it out. Even if she doesn’t want to follow through with what they say, me knowing the problem could help. She’s getting irritated with me, but it’s not just effecting her.

55189,"AITA for throwing out the kitchen sponge. So this is an AITA that my husband I are both reading and wanted community input.

Two days ago my husband and I got into an argument because I threw out the kitchen sponge and replaced it with a new one. The sponge was only 3-4 weeks old and had been sanitized by being microwaved in a bowl of water for 2 minutes. I sanitized at least twice if not three times in the 3-4 weeks.

My husband thinks that sponges should only be thrown out when it is obvious that they are done. When they really can't be cleaned, when they are literally falling apart, when they have a funky smell that won't go away with washing. He is against having an expiration date on the sponge and thinks you should only throw them out when they are done.

The sponge was used nearly everyday to knock off food particles because our dishwasher is pretty awful at cleaning dried on food. And it was used just as often to hand wash the bigger dishes.

So, AITA? How long should one keep a kitchen sponge around?

81602,"AITA for missing my grandmas funeral to go to a vacation that was non refundable?. In 31 years old and my husband and I planned an expensive vacation to the Caribbean last week. we planned this month's ago and it costs almost 10k. I didn't purchase travel insurance so the entire thing was mostly non refundable.

My grandmother had dementia, she used to live with us 10 years ago where we spent a lot of time together. We were very close. No other grandchild has spent more time her and knows her so well. I really did love her.

As her dementia got worse over the years we had to send her to a home. Slowly, but surely after 5 years, she was long longer herself. It broke me to see what she had become. But this new person wasn't her. I'd still see her once every month or 2. But it wasn't the same. It's been 5b years since I've kinda mourned her loss.

I let go of her mentally and grieved her loss.

I know at age 85 she could go at any time. Almost 2 weeks ago, she had a stroke and died shortly after.

Of course I was sad, but she died on a Wednesday and I was flying out on the Friday. Due to logistics we scheduled the funeral for Saturday.

I did try changing my flights (would have cost almost 3k). But I decided we'd spend time with the family at the wakes but still go on our vacation.

We got back night and apparently, my mom and sister waited till I got back to text me and tell me how ashamed, embarrassed and rude it was that I didn't make her funeral.

They said the entire family was talking about it and I bet not post any of those vacation pics online if I had any decency.

I get that I did choose fun and relaxation over a funeral. Believe me I wanted to go to but I just couldn't afford it and I couldn't waste 10k on a vacation I wouldn't end up taking.

Secondly if it were my parents dying, I'd never be in a state of mind to go. But I grieved the lost of my grandmother already, years ago. Yes her death felt different but I'm not overly sad. She was suffering and totally not herself any more.

A few days ago, I asked her if she wanted to do something together on Saturday afternoon & she said sure.

Yesterday my sister called & talked about her new camera. She wanted my mom to come over Saturday to show her how to use & maybe go for a walk to take pictures. My mom feels badly for my sister because she doesn't see her as much as me since we don't live together but she feels bad because she already made tentative plans with me. She suggested we both go over there Saturday & hang out with my sister. I love my sister but I honestly dislike hanging out with her too often because we don't have similar interests. I saw her for 4 days over the Christmas period anyways. I hate walking to 'stop & take pictures' because I find it boring & would rather just walk. It's also supposed to snow heavily so we'll probably just end up going to the mall, which I don't' need to spend money but I'll be tempted to. I'll also be 'stuck' over there as long as my mom wants to stay because I can't exactly leave without/before my mom if she drives because that'd be rude.

So, today my mother in law texts me around 3 PM letting me know that they are going to visit and they will bring the kids home after. Apparently they are having a BBQ with my step kids. At this point I am a little peeved. She literally gave me no notice, which would be fine except my husbands ex wife wont let my kids in the house. I don't know why either. Anyway, without notice I was not able to pack my kids warm clothes and their heavy coats. They had their sweaters and thats it. Where I live it gets to be about 40 degrees but windy.

I guess I’ll start off by saying Im an animal lover, and I love cats in particular. I come from a mildly poor family. I’ve never had to miss a meal or anything drastic, but “pleasure” spending was rare in my household. I am very close friends with an upper middle-class family, since I am the same age as the two sons. We were, and still are, best friends. Anyways, they made plans to go on a family vacation to Kauai, HI, and knowing my family’s tight budget, they very generously surprised my sister and I with plane tickets to join them. They payed for everything- hotel, fancy dinners, souvenirs, even private surfing lessons! It was amazing, and I was excited to see all the cats that roam the island. My sister and I were extremely grateful, and we made sure to express that profusely. At one point, we were beach-hopping, and we visited a  beach that was famous for having black sand. As we were walking towards the beach, I noticed a pair of malnourished kittens. At that point in my life, I don’t think I had ever seen an animal in that bad of shape before. Regardless, It broke my heart, so I stopped to feed them some leftover chicken from my sandwich. The rest of the family and my sister stopped for a second, and then continued to the beach while I stayed behind. I was not far at all from the actual beach, maybe 50 feet or so. I stayed with the kittens feeding them and petting them for about half an hour or so, until everyone decided to head towards the next beach. When we got in the car, the dad, who paid for everything, was very angry at me and proceeded to yell at me for not being on the beach with everyone, instead choosing to be with the kittens. He said, “I did not spend $600 for you to play with cats. You could have stayed home and it would have saved me the money.” I was completely taken aback, because it hadn’t even occurred to me that I might have been doing something wrong. Still, I apologized and everything was fine. But I still wonder- despite his angry use of wording, was he right?

My gf and I share a closet that we both go into every morning to get dressed for work. The closet uses a sliding door that means that only one half of the closet can be accessed at a time (I have half, she has half).

The issue is that she often leaves her shoes in the line of the sliding door instead of pushing them all the way into the closet or just putting then elsewhere. I never bother to move her shoes and simply slide the door over them because I just want to get ready and don't want to move them. This obviously scuffs the shoes where the door hit them and she got mad at me for ruining some of her shoes. I however take the stance that it is a natural consequence of leaving things directly in the path of the sliding door that she knows will have to move through there every day and it is instead her fault for placing her shoes there (I always make sure my stuff is out of the way)..

Once I figured out what was going on, I took over from the assisting team member (I have first aid training and he doesn't) and asked him to call the code so management and a store first aid officer could come and take over from me. 

It turned out that there was no first aid officer rostered on at the time. In fact, I was the only person in the store with a first aid qualification. Though I didn't mind (I like to help people and I have my first aid for a reason), I did get out 45 minutes late on my last day of work. I remember there being a huge kerfuffle last year when we didn't have enough first aid officers, and if I remember correctly, there is meant to be at least one rostered on at all times.

So they're not bad people but, the almost daily messing-with and jokes about me are starting to get to me. A part of me knows that it's all just fun and they aren't serious, but another part feels there's something they're trying to say and don't want to say it directly. I want to ask them to cool it, but in the past I've just been told i'm being too sensitive or that i shouldn't take it all to heart. Would i be the asshole for asking them to lay off even if I know they don't really mean it?. Am I the asshole?","I’d say no, everyone has different boundaries and sensitivities.

29254,"AITA for 'kicking out' my pregnant roommate?. This happenend over 5 yeaars ago, so no advice needed. 

I was the main tenant of a 3 bedroom apartment and two of my roomies left at once (they finished their studies and went to another city). I was looking for two new roommates but instead bonded quickly with another woman who was working full-time and wanted to rent two rooms for herself. One as a bedroom, the other one because she was doing home-office 2x a week. 

We agreed and everything went fine for \~2 months until she realised she got pregnant. Since she already rented two rooms at the flat she was sure she could just stay and use the office room for her child. I, however, told her she needs to leave because there is no fucking way I will live with a child. I told her she can stay until she finds a nice apartment but I don't want to deal with a screaming child and overall issues connected with it. She couldn't understand and said I was looking for two other roommates anyway and that she won't leave because she liked it here and can save money by living in a flat. We got in a fight and she has accused me of not showing solidarity with her situation and that this could happen to any woman, which I didn't find relevant in any way and just like she was playing the solidarity-card to get her way. 

Long story short, I quit her contract. She had over 3 months left to find a new home which is more than enough given her income and she - indeed - found a nice but rather expensive flat. Offtopic: She even left earlier and told me she won't be paying for the last month since she wouldn't be there. I knew I could easily find two roommates because the apartment was central and great, so I didn't do much about it, but wtf?

Yesterday, I met her and she just gave me the 'asshole stare'. Well am I? 5 years later I still feel like I would have done the same. A baby is not just a roommate and her financial situation was pretty stable. I would have been open to negotiations if the latter wasn't the case, but I still feel like it's my right to live in a child-free flat.. Am I the asshole?","NTA.

Ever since I was a kid I've been completely incapable of harming animals, even ones some people see as lesser like bugs or rodents. I ate meat as it was how I was brought up but if I was ever confronted about me being an animal lover I would find myself wrought with guilt. 


Now I'm in my 20s and through a lot of introspection I have found myself a fairly spiritual individual.

I understand this is unorthodox but I am not here to debate this so please be respectful.

It is; there are bald spots even whenever it gets bushy, especially on the sides. You can clearly see the skin through it in multiple places and I think it looks unprofessional and unattractive.

&#x200B;

He said it's okay because he doesn't care how he looks. I said I care how he looks. I said he can use Rogaine on it. He said he doesn't want to use weird chemicals on his face. I said it's not weird.

Then later I bought Rogaine without asking him, and when I gave it to him he recoiled and said again he doesn't want to use any chemicals on his face. I said OK, and I'm going to return it. Now I think I'm an asshole.

55867,"AITA for leaving group dinner early after plans got changed?. Complicated but stay with me. My girlfriend wanted me to come to a Canada Day dinner with 4 of her friends. I have only met 1 of these 4 friends. I wasn't comfortable from the beginning but she convinced me to come along.

From my perspective, we were having dinner at a restaurant and that was it. However, when we were ordering, my girlfriend got an alcoholic drink (she was the driver) and asked me after if I could drive. I was the only one at the table who would be able to drive now since there were 2 cars and only 2 sober people now (few others got drinks too). I tell my girlfriend that I would like to go home after dinner, and she begs me to stay for fireworks. I explain to her that I was under the impression it was just dinner, not dinner, hangout, then fireworks. 

At this point I probably sound like the dick for not wanting to see fireworks with my girlfriend. My girlfriends friends are just not my crowd. I would rather not spend my entire evening with 4 people I don't know. Also, dinner was super awkward as it was, nobody was talking and conversations were short lived. We were all just different people and didn't click well together. I told my girlfriend that my stance was firm and that I would just like to go home. She got really upset and got distant for the rest of dinner.

I should add: my girlfriend and I are communicating by text at the table. I look over at her phone and saw a screenshot sent to someone on a message app. I look back to our conversation and it was a screenshot of me saying that I'm not feeling it and that I would like to go home. I connect the dots and find out she sent it to all of her friends at the table in a groupchat. So now everyone at the table knows I want to go home because I'm not feeling it.

I know I would be a little pissed if I couldn’t find a stall when I needed to go in a crowded place but when this happens I just go find another bathroom or wait. I imagine not everyone does this so stalls come open. I usually leave after my legs fall asleep, I get hungry, or bored.

We have a ton of stuff together, including car, furniture and a cat (hers).

Two months into her job she started finding a bunch of excuses and saying I didn’t care about her and was jealous that she went. She broke up with me out of nowhere a few weeks later saying she wanted to go out with other people over there.

So fast forward 5 months. We talked every now and then but nothing much. The deadline of her day back was approaching so I started to make plans to move out. I have been living in our place with all of her stuff and it feels weird, feels like I am just waiting for her.

So I am planning to get everything in order... give back her stuff (or store it), transfer the car and give her the cat, etc.
Howeveeeeeeeeeer... she got another 8-month extension on the contract, so she is staying there. And the place she is at doesn’t allow cats.

40593,"AITA for hating my German friend?. A friend of mine is in town from Germany and is driving me fucking crazy. The dilemma is I cannot tell if this is cultural or not. Let me start, we lived together in college and she had been in the US for a few years at the point. She has now been in Germany for 5 years and is in the US to visit and asked to stay with me. The behavior I'm about to list was not present when we lived together previously but I can't tell if 5 years in Germany caused her to pick these things up.

First, we've seen a few movies together and she is always texting or talking on the phone in the theater. She doesn't seem to understand that this isn't okay. She also keeps asking to come to my place of work to 'hang out for a bit'. I've told her no as I like to stay professional with my colleagues but she keeps asking.

She also keeps trying to interact with my bf and I when we are naked/showering/ using the toilet etc. Just yesterday I was in a towel in my bedroom and my bf was in his boxers on the bed. She barged in the room unannounced and tried to join in on our conversation. She wakes up earlier than me and she will come into my bedroom, get into my bed and put her face very close to mine to tell me she is leaving. It's creepy as fuck.

Lastly, she won't lock the doors on our house when she leaves even though I gave her keys and asked her to always lock up.

Sorry, one more- I have a cat and she is always pushing him off of stuff. He is elderly so I've asked her to be careful with him but today she pushed him off of our couch by pulling him by his tail.

My dilemma is that she seems so ignorant to the thing she is doing and gets very upset when I asked her to do something or not do something. She says I'm controlling her and that she doesn't understand. She has a degree in behavioral analysis and she is a smart girl. I've gotten so angry that I've yelled at her, told her not to touch my cat anymore, and that if she doesn't lock up she can't stay in my home for the rest of her visit. I feel like I might be a bad friend but then I see her do something and am unsure.

Edit: I should clarify about the cat. She is pushing him off of the couch or away from her stuff because she doesn't like cats I think. I feel I made it sound like she was pushing him just for fun. I mean, she is still too mean to him but I wanted to clarify.. Am I the asshole?","NTA- stop being friends with this person.

Everyone noticed the dog especially the young children. My mom's friend daughter we will call her Tilly because she is a important part of the story.

Tilly points out to my younger sister that the small children are pulling on and throwing the small dog from his small paws and tugging on his ears and tail roughly to the point of yelping and when the dog when to the adults for help they would pick him up and toss him to the side like a toy they were annoyed with and kicking him hard. Tilly and my sister took the dog from the kids as they try and play literal tug of war with the dog by his head and hind legs. They gave him water and my mother and Tilly's mother noticed and both felt like they had to do something.

While the family was distracted they tucked the dog in a park bag that had carried my younger brothers tonka trucks in and got my siblings and I in the car. One in the car the bag was put on my lap and out came the small dog's head excited and curious. We immediately took him to the vet to find out he was barely 6 month old and was bruised.

Apartments in our area go fast so it was important we signed ASAP. The leasing company offers “roommate matching” so we were originally relying on that to find us another roommate. 

Today one of our friends tells us that his current roommate has informed him that she will be transferring and won’t be living with him come fall. He is uncomfortable living with strangers given past circumstances with shady randomized roommates. He asked if he could live with us. 

My gut reaction was “oh my god yes”. He’s an ideal roommate, he doesn’t drink or smoke and he’s a little bit of a clean freak. I’d sincerely prefer him to any random female roommate we could possibly be assigned. I’ve already expressed to him that I like the idea of him living with us.

As I approached the door a man and woman came to the door and knocked. I vaguely recognize the woman, but school security policy says that all people visiting the school need to use the front/main entrance. I made a shrug gesture and mouthed something like ""sorry I'm not allowed to let you in"".

47126,"AITA for not meeting biological (adopted) child. I was inspired by a recent post to get judgement for my own situation.

I'm a 53 year old woman. When I was 16 I had a daughter, we'll call her Bernadette. I was from a farming family in the middle of a very religious state, having a baby out of marriage was unacceptable. I was sent away to a ""Methodist Bible Camp"" and the baby was given up for adoption. It's been 37 years and the child I gave away has recently found me. Apparently she did a 23andMe, or a Ged Match, or something. In any case she uploaded her DNA results to the internet and found some relatives. It wasn't that hard for her to find out where she came from since I'm from a small town where most of my family lived over the generations and my pregnancy wasn't exactly secret.

She reached out on Facebook and wants to meet. She sent me photos of her family. She has children, a husband, a lovely life. It seems that she has a great relationship with the parents who raised her, the adoptive parents. I've long since gotten past giving her up and managed to make a life for myself. I went to teaching school, got my Masters, married a great man, have wonderful children I was in a position to raise.

I don't want to meet Bernadette. That's a part of my past that I don't want to return to. After I returned from my year long exile I married the first man I could just to get the hell out of that town and I didn't speak to most of my family again. My parents didn't treat me very well after I got pregnant and I was an only child. After college my first husband and I divorced and I met my current (and forever) husband. My life has been wonderful. I've always felt regret about Bernadette but ultimately I'm content with my choice.

I told Bernadette this and offered to write her a letter to answer any questions she might have, but I was not willing at this time to meet face-to-face. Needless to say Bernadette did not take it well. She wasn't sad, she was angry. Based on the tone of her messages to me she felt she was ""entitled"" to meet me and ""entitled"" to my time. I understand her having questions but I don't see how she has a right to demand more than I'm willing to offer. She got particularly nasty so I was forced to block her and my husband and children blocked her as a precaution.

Basically we just moved in together less than 2 months ago and my partner is blaming not being able to sleep in the new house on having to share a bed with me. He's never been in a relationship or lived with someone before now and I think that he just needs to give it some time so he can get used to the new space and sharing a bed with someone but he thinks the solution is that we sleep in separate rooms. This really has me feeling hurt because the best part of my day is waking up beside him and being able to snuggle up before work and I just feel like he isn't giving it a chance. The other part is that the spare room isn't a spare room it's my lab where I work on all my biology experiments and do my writing and there is no room for a bed there without me giving up my hobbies and there is one other room but it's his office and he isn't willing to give it up for the extra bed and is putting it on me... I think the solution here is to give it some more time for things to settle and maybe to get him a pair of earplugs.

We grew up together, and with that came the annoying little tag-a-long sister I grew to love and protect.  She's been making some horrible choices lately and she refuses to admit it. 
    She quit her high school job because it was ""too difficult"" her and dropped out of college to spend time with her new boyfriend. Her boyfriend is the WORST influence on her. He is severely over weight and has horrible eating habits (eating 3 hot dogs 4 cheeseburgers and various side dishes at a BBQ he wasn't even invited to). He can't hold a job longer than 3 months and tells her it's fine to drop out of school and not work. Meanwhile he's almost 30 and has been going for his associate degree since he was 18. Still hasn't graduated. I get that people work at their own pace in college, but he takes one class a semester fails it and repeats. This is all so he can sit in the student lounge and order a Chinese buffet and pizza ""for his friends"" (really he eats most of it). Their goal is to save up enough to buy a motor home. (He's still living with his parents and grandmother and she moved in with him. 
    I can't exactly judge their age difference because my fiance and I are 12 years apart. But she just turned 20 and is still very immature. He's about 30 and has no accomplishments in life. He doesn't have a license or a car so he relies on her for everything. Boyfriend even bent the frame of her car a few times due to his weight. He randomly quits jobs solely because he doesn't feel like going in that day. 
    Recently at her own cousin's wedding she threw a tantrum that she wasn't allowed to bring her boyfriend and stormed out with an Uber. My best friend and my parents are telling me do not under any circumstances invite her. It just sucks because she has been the little sister I never had for 10 years.

A few months ago, my dad came out of the closet that she was transitioning to female, which I fully support so don't make any comments about that. She said I can still call her my dad or my parent so that's what I do, so don't get the wrong idea.

The problem is now that she is transitioning she wants to hang out with me and my friends when they come over. She never had the slightest interest in getting to know my friends before this. 

She really encouraged me to have a sleepover at her place which was great, I thought she was trying to help me adjust to the separation and the new place. She kind of went all-out, picked up snacks, games. We don't really play games at a sleepover at my age but I thought it was nice of her to think about that. 

But once my friends went over I realized she was planning to hang out with us. She even put on a pajama set which I've never seen my dad in a pajama set before and this was straight out of Golden Girls. And my friends were all just in normal clothes. She encouraged us to play the games she got and it was VERY awkward (they were just random games she got from Wal-Mart). We all ended up just spending most of the night watching Netflix shows and looking at memes online so that was fine.

Nobody said anything about it to me afterwards but a couple people are avoiding me now. Meanwhile my parent has been encouraging me to have another sleepover again and I don't feel comfortable doing that again. I sort of awkwardly tried to bring it up and she cried and said that this was a part of life she completely missed out on. That she's not really different from a teenage girl because she is going through the girl version of adolescence right now because of hormone therapy. And she doesn't want to miss out on all these things a second time.

I’m not going for the girl that invited me, nor am I interested in her, but she’s really popular and all of my friends were going and we’d have a good time.

But my gf was convinced that she’d try mess with me, as she’s made comments about me in the past, maybe years ago. My gf said that she has finals the day after and all she would do is worry and nothing I could say would change that.

So after a heap of her guilt tripping and me and friends trying to persuade her it will be fine, I just decided to lie and say that I wasn’t going at all, she said she was over it but I guess I thought she was just fronting, so I kept the lie going.

I went to the party, nothing crazy happened between me and the girl, I had a fun night out, while texting her here and there checking up on my gfs studies, and went home. She then sat her finals and said she knows she did really well, which is great, so I then told her later on in the day that I went to the party, and lied just to make sure she would do her exams stress free.

7230,"AITA for thinking ""white trash"" is a racist term?. Lemme start this off by saying that I'm not racist so any terms that get used that might be considered offensive are just being used as examples. I love and hate all races equally. All of humanity is garbage. Anyhow, on to the matter at hand.

I believe the term ""white trash"" is inherently racist to all races *except* white people. I think using the term is actually pretty awful once you realize what you're saying. With all other racist terms, the hate is built right in. You don't say ""black nigger"" or ""mexican spic"". So why the extra qualifier in ""white trash""? Well, because the term supposes that everyone assumes white people *aren't* trash inherently and that this term is for special exceptions. I don't think people who use the term are racist necessarily, but I don't think they realize what they're actually implying by using the term. 

Whenever I try to point this out to people, no one is able to follow what I mean or they just don't like the implication. I've never heard any cogent arguments *against* my point, but whenever I bring it up it automatically pisses off everyone in the discussion. Why? Am I really an asshole for thinking this? Is there something obvious I'm overlooking here or do they just want to use the term and not feel weird about it? Help me out here!

37714,"WIBTA for making a return?. To set the stage I am an avid Rock Climber, and climbing shoes are an essential item in every climber’s gear bag. 

I recently purchased a pair of shoes from a friend at a huge discount. The shoes were brand new, albeit too small for him. I decided I would try and make them fit and bought them from him for $50, but after wearing them for a day I discovered they are a half size too small for me. I asked if he would take them back, but he said no. I called the company that makes the shoes and told them that they were still in “like new” condition but that I did not have the original box. The company basically said tough luck and left it at that. 

Now there is an outdoor equipment company that has an incredibly open return policy that I have purchased shoes from before. Their policy is “if it’s within the first year it was purchased then the item can be returned or exchanged with no questions asked” and any returned items are then sold in a Garage Sale style event each quarter. 

My thought process is if I purchase the same shoes in the proper size then return the pair that doesn’t fit would that make me an asshole? The shoes have only ever been worn twice, once by the original owner and once by me, and would be bought by someone else that could use them at the Garage Sale event, and I would have a pair of shoes that fit. 

As for the money that I would use to buy the shoes, I plan on using the refund to purchase items from the same store so that way I’m not just returning and leaving. My question is would that make me an asshole? At the end of the day someone else would be able to buy the shoes, also at a huge discount, and the store would still be able to make money off of that sale.

81859,"AITA because I said I'm only sorry a singer died because people won't stop abusing the public with his songs now?. Any broken English is my fault.

Also no way I'm going to say this guy's name 'cause for sure, any people from my country are going to attack me since they're going to know who I'm speaking about immediately.

This is the story, however:

One year ago, a little more longer than that actually, a popular singer from my country died from lung cancer. People were extremely upset and radios constantly played his songs only, some of them even consecrated whole of their web player channels to his discography.

Now okay, this was fine and understandable for month, two, even three after the death since he was such a classic icon here. But still main national radios won't stop abusing everyone with constant repeats of his songs. When we listen to radio in my office, or when I go to a freaking grocery shop, I can't escape his voice no matter what.

I liked most of his songs before but now I almost hate them because of this.

So yesterday I told my colleague from work how this singer now like an evil ghost, haunting people even after his burial. This was because one of his most popular songs came on the radio again for thousandth time. She said something like the English saying ""you can't speak ill of the dead"" and I answered, well I'm only sorry he's dead at this point because of media forcing him down our throats so much.

Btw he also was far from perfect during his life, he cheated on his wife and had an illegitimate son. But now everyone's acting like he's an angel.

But anyway my colleague was really mad that I said that, she called me heartless and too cynical, how would I feel if he was my family and so on. I apologized to her because I want to keep peace in my workplace but I don't actually believe I did something wrong for voicing my opinion about a public person, even though he's dead now.

And recently the spam telemarketers have gotten really bad.  Hanging up on them quickly does nothing.  It’s part of the cost to them. They expect it. 

So I upped my game. I keep them on the phone a while when I have time. Waste their time so the cannot waste others time.  My favourite was a few years ago when I had friends over playing cards. That guy was on the line for 10 mins and even called back when we got “disconnected”. 

But now I’m getting a call for “Duct cleaning” several times a week. I hang up. I try wasting their time. They give zero shits.

68670,"WIBTA for no longer inviting a 'friend' to D&D?. (Throwaway bc my friends know my reddit)

&#x200B;

I (19F) am the DM for a group of 6 people, 5 of whom are lovely. However, a friend of a friend (who I'll call Sarah) has been less than pleasant ever since we've started the campaign. I've never exactly been good friends with this person, our views on certain topics are simply too different to have a respectful friendship with each other. Because of our differing views, she's always been cold towards me and, earlier this year, Sarah started a witch hunt on social media by anonymously spreading false rumours about me. This lead to me being blocked by over half of my roleplay partners bc they didn't want to hear my side of the story. At the time, I didn't know why this happened and who sent these rumours. 

Despite our cold relationship, I did invite her to my D&D sessions, simply because she's the more experienced player and she would be able to help everyone out with character creation and roleplay. I may not particularly like her in real life but I do appreciate her skills as a roleplayer.

Recently, however, my best friend confided in me that it was Sarah who sent these rumours on the internet. Why she did that she didn't know. All my best friend knew that Sarah did not have any remorse about it and enjoyed seeing me breakdown over losing people I've been writing with for years. This, for me, was the straw that broke the camel's back and I decided to no longer invite her to D&D.

I'll be honest here and say that I've not always been the kindest to Sarah either. I have had my moments of laughing at her misfortune and causing said misfortune, for example, I had caused her to fail an important test by snitching on the fact she was cheating.

My best friend thinks I'm justified in my actions. My other friends think I'm an asshole because Sarah is the only one who has played D&D before and is the only one who can kind of lead us through what we're doing. They say that if I ban Sarah, they won't be coming either.

No D&D > Bad D&D

1 - A player who is refusing to be respectful both at and away from the table is a toxic player who should find a different group

2 - There doesn't need to be someone leading the party.

This is because that person becomes a de facto protagonist when D&D is about an ensemble cast.

3 - If your friends are the type of people to stop talking to you because someone else did something wrong, then they aren't your friends.",0,0,0,0,1

29980,"AITA for hiding how much money I make when dating (and planning on revealing it some time into the relationship)?. So, I was born in the US but I've lived my whole life in Mexico, in a border city. I studied college here, software engineering. As soon as I graduated I looked for jobs in the US, and I'm currently earning 85k, still living in Mexico. I'm paying a mortgage on a 220k condo and renting it out for 2k, plus I got a side project with some local businesses (which is mostly done out of passion) that brings me \~20k, so total income is \~130k. So, that's a shit ton of money here. For context, a friend of mine that's a mechanical engineer is earning \~14k. I live well below my means, I rent an apartment along my best friend, I pay $300 and she pays $100 (I wanted to pay it all, we settled on this), and other than being in a decent area it's very meh. I drive a 2012 Versa, I don't dress fancy at all, etcetera. If I weren't paying mortgage I'd save more than 90% of my income. You get the point.

So, I recently signed up on Tinder, got one date, we went to a place that isn't fancy at all (not shitty, just super casual).  When she asked what I did for a living, I mentioned just my side project. I obviously didn't mention the condo. I do this because I don't want any gold diggers.

If I were to start  relationship, my main job will come out pretty quickly, even before it's official. The exact salary, I don't know when, maybe when we start discussing moving in together. As for the condo, I'd say when we're living together for at least a year. My best friend says it's okay to not mention the condo (though she differs on the reveal time), but that it's very very rude to not mention my main job. I do this because I don't want any gold diggers, sadly had to learn that the hard way last year when we were together for just six months and she wanted me to pay for a two weeks vacation in Dubai and I suggested one week in a southern Mexican state and she broke up with me.

51814,"AITA: Not signing for a FWB storage unit when he was out of town moving his mom to the area?. I moved to an area unfamiliar to me, and met a FWB on grindr who was also new to the area. Have quite a bit in common interest wise, super attractive and my type, etc. Past year we have kept this relationship of casual texting and sex. I initially came in wanting more, but he was more interested in sex...so I understood and was okay with keeping it just that.....and that's what it has been.

However, last week things got weird. I had known for awhile his mom came into financial trouble and was living with him. He was moving her to the area, and called me asking for a favor. He wanted me to go and sign for a storage unit for her. He said I was the only person he knew in the area and that we'd transfer from mine to her name next day. Something just they wouldn't get there before it closed. That info all checks out too...like I knew from talking to him prior and all.

I said no.

I felt...like I didn't know him *that* well to sign for a storage unit for someone I didn't know. Like, his whole identity could be a lie, he could be smuggling drugs and want me to take the fall for some storage unit to store it. I have no idea...and obviously that's stretch of a conclusion but if true I'm the one now caught up in it.

I'm almost certain it was total good intentions....but that slight bit of doubt in my mine. Like, he asked me to help him hes broken down? I'm there. He needs someone to drive him to the hospital?

I had no problem with that. Fast forward to now, I'm stripped for a vehicle and i don't get a monthly check for social security. What i did get was given to my mother instead for my brothers.

13751,"AITA for emailing the Professor that no one is here for the test?. Greetings , so here it goes I am doing my postgraduate studies and for it we have a final group project for which I have worked really hard (technically I kept the group together and made sure everything was right and on time) so we had one last experiment we had to conduct which was a 7 hour test it consisted of weighing each specimen and then boiling for 5 hours and weighing again. So we all agreed to arrive at 08:00 am. And I commute for studies (1 hr drive) so I wake up at 6 and leave at 6:45 and reach there around 8:00 and no one is there. 1 group member messages me saying he will be late for 10 minutes (no big deal) but the other 3 just weren't there. 2 of us did the weighing and writing the weight (would be faster If all were there) so now it's 09:15 and others are no where to be found (their phone was off) so I email our project advisor saying that no one is here except 2 of us and the project should have started at 08:00 am. And Professor replies saying he is dissatisfied is the other members and know he knows who is interested in the project and gives them shit . So now it's 09:30 am. One guy shows up and now I leave for meeting and then a class. The remaining 2 show up at 12:15 pm all pissed of at me. Saying they were busy and bad weather and meeting (excuses and I came from other city before them in bad weather),they were like you shouldn't have emailed the professor (prof warned them of a grade F last warning) and they wouldn't do it if I were late and I replied saying I would have let you guys know that I will be late.

68502,"AITA for helping my brother get medical marijuana behind my mother’s back?. My brother has a disability that causes him a lot of pain. I won’t go in on it because he has a reddit (I’m not worried about him finding this hence not a throwaway) and because the specifics aren’t important. Just know his pain is very real and well documented. 

My brother took up vaping THC to help cope and it seems to have helped a lot, but my mom didn’t like it. She worried about it having adverse affects. I do agree with her on that, vaping isn’t super healthy, but she’s gotten it into her head that he shouldn’t have it at all now. 

We live in a state where it’s legal to use recreationally, though I think he’s underage for that at nearly 19, but getting a medical card would be easy. She just won’t do it.

My brothers been down lately, his birthday is very soon so I’ve been pestering him on what he wants and he kept saying “I don’t know” until today he finally admitted he wants cartridges to vape as he isn’t doing well without them. I don’t know why, but it set me off. My brother is 18, he’s an adult, he can go to any doctor he sees fit and talk about medical marijuana usage and all that. I told him I’d help him however I could.

Maybe this seems like an obvious NTA, but there’s going to be fallout. My mom is super over protective (we both live at home for now) and we’ve never done anything like this, we’ve been good kids. Another con is I fear my brother may be becoming too dependent on it, getting pretty damned stoned sometimes. He’s capable of becoming more independent, but right now he’s content to sit in his room and watch YouTube all day.

11113,"AITA for writing a fake review of my coworker to improve her work ethic?. TL;DR - had worst coworker in the world, learned she read our restaurant reviews and was self-conscious so I wrote a fake review insulting her customer service. She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better.

&#x200B;

I'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works.

&#x200B;

She hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.

&#x200B;

One thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip.

&#x200B;

A week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.

&#x200B;

I'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.

My parents (semi-retired) are planning a big family trip to get everyone together and visit my grandma for her 90th birthday: Me (32M), my girlfriend (29F), my brother (34M), and his gf (31F).

In order to entice my my brother and I to spend more vacation days on the trip, my parents offered to spring for our hotel rooms if we were coming with our significant others. Well, my brother's gf bailed because she recently got a promotion at work and can't make it. My parents tell him he can stay with them in their room since he doesn't need the privacy any more. This conversation then ensues:

[https://imgur.com/a/bCpoFpS](https://imgur.com/a/bCpoFpS)

AITA for telling my brother he can't stay with my gf and me?

&#x200B;

Extra back story if anyone cares:

I moved out shortly after college. My brother floundered for a bit after failing out of college a few times, but eventually moved to follow a job a couple years after me. So we don't get everyone together super often (maybe once every two years). We've both been dating our gf's for years, but because we're all on different corners of the continent, they aren't completely comfortable with the rest of the family.

My brother's always been the more pampered out of the two of us since he's the older son, but really terrible with money. Part of the reason my parents decided to pay for hotel rooms for us is that there's a good chance my brother wouldn't be able to afford the trip if he had to pay his own way. They had to fully comp his portion the last time we got together as a family. All the while he and his gf make a decent wage (\~60k USD each annually) and have a house that my parents put the down payment on (their monthly mortgage is below $1200). So yea, he's just sort of terrible with money, I have no idea where it goes. I'd be surprised if he has anything beyond one paycheck of liquid money.

My parents are relatively well off, so the money for an extra room isn't a big deal for them. I know they are disappointed that my brother's gf couldn't make it, though.

I'm considering just offering to give him the room and get my own for me and my gf, but I'm pretty sure I got framed as an inconsiderate and unloving brother last time this happened.. Am I the asshole?","NTA

He had not been to a doctor in over 10 years, and these problems had been lying dormant in him for who knows how long. While we were in the emergency room, he was bawling his eyes out, apologizing to me for not being a good Dad (even though he has!), and for not taking better care of himself. It was a really strong emotional moment, and I just held him and said it was okay and that everything would be okay. My Mom died when I was 12, so I think him leaving me behind has always been a huge anxiety for him.

61632,"AITA for not wanting someone to be added to a group chat?. Hey there,

My friend recently created a group chat for LGBT women and nonbinary people. Maybe a week or two ago about 15 of us were added. We got to know each other and gradually started posting about our mental health and personal shit.

I’m questioning my gender atm. I’m not sure exactly what’s up, but “she/them” are my pronouns. I consider that quite a vulnerable piece of information. All our nicknames have our pronouns on.

Earlier today someone who has a close mutual friend with me gets added to the chat. I message my friend and ask her to check before adding people to the chat. She says she will but it wasn’t obvious how I felt and it was on me that I didn’t ask for someone not to be added. I feel like it’s obvious that when people reveal personal shit you are sensitive with that info and check before telling/adding people. There’s a back and forth. She says I made assumptions about what the group chat would be and it wasn’t obvious I’d have an issue with people being added and seeing my pronouns.

74692,"AITA for not picking my brother as my “Man of Honor”?. Sorry in advance for the length but really looking for some help on this one because it’s caused some family drama...

I recently got engaged and went through the process of picking my wedding party (which is pretty big- I have 8 and my fiancée (M) has 8). I have 4 really close male friends from college so I decided to make them my “Bridesmen” (it’s 2019, not that weird). One of these 4 guys is my best friend- I asked him to be my “Man of Honor” and he was ecstatic. I also asked my fiancée’s sister to be a bridesmaid, along with a close friend (F). My only siblings are 2 guys, who I also asked to be my “Bridesmen.” We are triplets, which doesn’t seem like an important detail (although obviously cool) but it’s my moms main reasoning for why I should feel “closer” to him. 

Although my brother hasn’t said anything, my mom recently expressed how upset she is that I didn’t pick my brother as my “Man of Honor.” Although we are triplets, I have always been closer to one of my brothers and she assumed I would pick him. Obviously I AM close with the guy- we have known each other literally my entire life. However, it seemed like an easy choice for me- my college friend has been much more involved in my life in recent years and he has helped me through a lot of difficult situations that my brother never really got involved in. He is someone I speak to on a daily basis, who has known my fiancée since the beginning and was actively involved in my proposal (where my brother wasn’t). Also, my friend is just the type of guy who will take an active role in the wedding itself where my brother is much more reserved and would be perfectly content as a participant without much to do. 

Although I don’t regret my choice at all, my mom is really making me feel bad about this. My mom claims that since I have only known this college friend for such a shorter length of time, it is ridiculous that I’d feel closer to him than my brother.

Back in August, I introduced my roommate and longtime friend Joey to my friend Monica, whom I met in a class we shared in the spring semester.

It didn't take long for Joey to develop a very strong crush on Monica, and they've already gone on a handful of dates. However, unbeknownst to Joey, his feelings for Monica are unrequited.

In my private discussions with Monica and Joey, I've gleaned some very important details about the situation.

1. Monica is aware that Joey ""probably"" has feelings for her, but they've both been very passive about discussing their relationship. She's been waiting for Joey to confess his interest in her so that she could let him down. So it looks like for better or worse, she's been stringing him along for at least four months.

2. Joey has told me in no uncertain terms that he likes Monica. In fact, he's already begun to refer the two of them as a couple despite it not ever having been communicated.

3. Monica has feelings for me. And damn it all, I can't conceal my emotions too well. I'm pretty sure she knows that I like her too just from how much I blush with every little hint (read: very obvious sign) she gives me. I'm pretty sure it's because she likes me that she doesn't like Joey.

I'm not the type to go behind someone's back. **I've already relayed all the information I've listed here and more to Joey. I made it clear to him that I have feelings for Monica and that it's likely that she actually has feelings for me.** His reaction has been expectedly poor, basically outright denial.

I've encouraged Joey to talk to Monica about the situation, but he still hasn't, probably for fear of rejection. It's been about six weeks already and two weeks ago, I made him an ultimatum: In a week's time, I would talk to Monica about the situation to get things straightened out if Joey didn't do it himself.

As you can guess from the wording, I still haven't talked to Monica about it despite saying that I would. I really want Joey to get the closure he needs by doing it himself, because I'm sure the whole situation is painful enough and I don't want to hurt his feelings any more than they already are.

That being said, I don't want to continue to put this part of my life on hold for the sake of Joey's feelings. I feel like I've waited long enough and said everything that I could to be as transparent as possible about everything.

So with all this in mind (and more, if you need more information), would I be the asshole if I made a move on Monica?

For a while, both my parents worked and I started taking care of my brothers most nights because of my parents work schedule. Well not a perfect system, it worked well enough.

And then my mom wanted to go to school again. Which was fine with me when my stepdad was still working. But then my stepdad got sick. 

I honestly am very upset with my parents about this. I think it’s irresponsible of her to not work more than a day a week when we clearly don’t have enough money to stay a float currently (I know for a fact we don’t given she constantly complains about it to me) and to leave me to take care of my brothers and stepdad. She’s never home even when she doesn’t have school because she thinks our house is too distracting. I do everything around the house. All the chores, grocery shopping, making sure everyone gets to school on time, making sure my stepdad is okay, cooking, etc. I didn’t have much of a life outside of my family and school before this all happened, which was fine. But now it literally doesn’t exist because there’s just not enough hours in the day. 

I never told my parents how I felt that they are being irresponsible and being unfair for putting this amount of stress on me when I’m still a teenager because I know for a fact they would consider me the asshole in this situation. I’ve also had friends think I’m being an asshole about it. So, am I?. Am I the asshole?","NAH

While it is perfectly reasonable to not be able to deal with all these stress. It is also not unreasonable for your mom to assume that you are okay with supporting the family, especially when you haven't spoke up.

Perhaps try to add some communication. Keep it as unemotional as possible. Explaining how you also have plan for your life but this situation put you into a hole where you have no room to grow and diminishing your own future, and desire everyone else in the family to help the family equally. if you are not getting support for that, then perhaps someone is a asshole, but until then, I don't think anyone know.

65730,"WIBTA for helping expose a kid. Alright so I’m kinda new to the whole story but lemme reiterate what I know. 

Pretty much there’s this person on Reddit who told a story about a kid who sends other kids dick pics. 

I messaged them asking if I could assist which they said sure you could help. 

From what I read the mass majority of people he sent them to he also asked for nudes. To which (from my knowledge) they all declined. 

Apparently he started spamming them and spamming them with voice calls, etc just overall harassing them. 

Also apparently he keeps some of the nudes? (Idk if it’s true but from what the op said they have a feeling they kept them). 

Apparently he did this on different accounts but I’m pretty sure I could pinpoint a single one for information on him. 

I’m not planning on going and hunting down the kid cause that’s not what I want to do. 

All I plan on doing is reporting it to his school or his parents so people are aware of this child’s actions (the kid is 14 from what I know).

He was an absolute amazing sweetheart and absorbed all the comments without snapping back, and I kept privately begging him to leave because he didn’t deserve that disrespect but he kept reassuring me that it was best to just stick it through and prove he wasn’t affected.

56667,"AITA for completely losing it at my brother for clicking his fingers at me.. I feel a bit of backstory is necessary here. My brother [16M] and I [22F] have always had a stained relationship. My Father (who I don't speak to, but my brother does) always wanted a son. He never wanted a daughter. So when my brother was born when I was 6, he basically stopped talking to me in favour of my brother. 3 years later, my parents got divorced. 

On weekend visitations with my Father we always did whatever my brother wanted to do. My opinion was never valued. I think my brother (calling him Larry) knew that he always got his way and has grown up with that. 

I went no contact with my father after being fed up of his chronic favouritism. He refused to send to me a good school, but he sends my brother to an elite private school, and I just got a little fed up. So, you can see why our relationship is strained. 

I just moved back home after ending a 2.5 year long abusive relationship and my ex won the apartment. I only have 3 months left of my college course so I moved back to my Moms house. She was happy to have me back.

***ANYWAY***

Now Larry is not happy that I am in his space. 

When I got home my brother started snapping his fingers at me if I annoyed him. This really irritated me, as I don't think you should snap your fingers at anyone- it is the height of rudeness. He also puffs his body up when he's near me, to intimate me (he's much taller than me already at 16). This is hard to explain, but Larry also tries to frighten me when I am studying by jumping really loudly on the floorboards behind me. It's irritating. The one thing that really irritates me is him snapping his fingers.

46136,"AITA for going over my manager and selling non-vegan items in our vegan workplace?. I work in a shoe store, historically we've sold mostly leather and other animal products but last year they've been making the push to synthetics to catch the vegan market. Two months ago we got an announcement to remove all non-vegan stuff from fixtures and only focus on the vegan synthetic stuff. Our store branding is full of ""vegan shoes"" marketing and buzzwords.

FWIW I'm not vegan. I began working here well before this recent push. But I don't hate the vegan options: a lot of times I would be fooled into thinking a synthetic is leather at first glance, and I wear both types of shoes with no preference.

Our manager is being anal about only selling vegan products. HO says we can still sell the older, non-vegan stuff, but going forward, don't expect non-vegan stock. As someone who really hates stores with revolving inventory so frequently, I feel for the customers who come in, ask for the same thing they got xyz years ago, only to find out that model only lasted 6 months.

For the last two weeks, I've been selling non-vegan products against my manager's wishes because I figure HO's rule overrides my manager's rule. If a customer comes in asking for so-and-so, the manager will say no but I will say yes, gleefully go to the back, and help the customer because they come first.

I am in *no trouble* with the company, but my manager is giving me a rough time. By HO's orders, we have to keep the old stock in the back until it's recalled, so he's powerless to stop me.

Here's where it gets tricky: my manager and senior associates (such as myself) get a bonus for new stock sold. Older stock sales are not incentivized. My manager is upset because ""I'm making his life harder"" by actively working against this end.

You’re not breaking company rules but HO rules don’t “supersede”  your managers rules. HO has determined that the stores can sell old stock if they wish but that type of decision, on a store by store basis, is up to the person in charge of the particular store - notably your manager, not you.

36690,"AITA for not wanting to change my ""pyjamas""?. * My boyfriend - James (20)
* His sister - Jane (19)
* Jane's boyfriend - Mark (19)

James and Jane live together. They have this deal with their parents that if they live together while they finish up their studies their parents will cover rent.

As they both siblings have partners, James tries to come to my place most of the time, and Jane tends to go to Mark's place, but it doesn't always work out and there are some days when all 4 of us end up in the flat at the same time.

I've never been one to wear pyjamas, but because there are situations where all 4 of us are there simultaneously, I bought a pair of shorts to wear in the mornings. The shorts are fairly short. It's not like my entire arse is hanging out, they probably come to just above mid thigh. I admit they would not pass the fingertip test, but they'd fail by about half an inch at most.

On the mornings after I stay over at James' place I'll usually wear these shorts with my shirt from the night before. My shirts tend to be baggy (usually box cut) and not prone to clinging. On some occasions I can't wear my shirt from the night before, so I just borrow one of James'. We're different sizes, and his shirts when on me tend to be loose in the shoulders and waist but a bit tighter/clingier in the chest and hips.

I don't think it's indecent, as outfits go. Everything from shoulder to just-above-mid-thigh is covered.

Jane has said to James that she doesn't like it, and has asked that I either keep some more of my shirts to change into or invest in some ""proper"" PJs, which I'm guessing means something more like what Jane wears (men's joggers and a baggy shirt). James told me all of this, and when I asked him what the deal was he told me that Jane thought she had caught Mark looking at me. Before anyone suggests it, I asked Jane directly, and she said enough to confirm that this was all her, none of this came from James.

I feel like me going from no pyjamas ever to shorts an a t shirt was agiven as it's not my flat and I can't exactly walk around in my underwear, but I really don't want to buy loose fitting joggers and more baggy shirts, and I kind of like wearing James' shirts the next morning. Also I didn't see Mark staring, and even if he was, I don't see how that would be my fault. James sides with me, and says when I come over I'm coming to see him, so I shouldn't have to adjust for Jane and Mark, but has also said that it would make his living situation easier if Jane wasn't ""bitching"" (his word) to him about how I'm dressed.

AITA for not wanting to get new PJs?. Am I the asshole?","NTA but buy some regular PJs.

Mark shouldn't be looking at you and Jane shouldn't be concerned with your reasonable pajamas.

I had a huge mental breakdown and stress ate my heart out. We went to see a dietitian, child obesity specialist, and still have bi-weekly checkups with our family doctor on how I'm doing. My mom promised to be by my side every step of the way, since she had gone through something similar in her childhood in terms of mental health.

It was going to be a change for the whole household to make things easier, getting rid of all the carb filled snacks and sweets. And for the first month, it was going just fine. Then they completely cracked, and have since given up on helping me. 

I have since continued to go along with what we'd discussed with the dietitian, and have seen a huge improvement in my overall health, and most noticably my figure. 

Now I'm seeing my mom as a hypocrite, since she's telling me to go out and exercise (which I'm already doing once or twice a day) while she stays in all day in the recliner, eating a crap ton of ""comfort food"" and asking if I really need a second helping of whatever we were having for dinner.

I love my mom, don't get me wrong. But I really dislike hypocritical behavior (I know, we're all guilty of it at one time or another, I still don't like it) and empty promises.

My mom is not the picture of good health, and is easily where I got the habit of stress eating. I sometimes find myself stating at her and just be angry.

Currently I live in a low income housing project as I had my daughter after graduating with a certificate but things did not work out as planned and I did not get a job in my field. I am currently working and start university in the fall at the ripe age of 35 so I can move out and make a better life for my daughter.

It was great at first, quiet and peaceful until I got new neighbors to the left and right of me. It started sporadically, and then became a nuisance.

I will be on the treadmill at 9am and get a knock at the door from the old lady asking for a cigarette. She does this like clockwork every end of the month when she runs out of social security. She paid me back with cheap brand cigarettes I don’t even smoke so I put them in my freezer for the next time she asked. I won’t even take the quarter she offers me, I’ll just give her one because every smoker knows it’s more of an inconvenience when your down a cigarette and that last one can save you from a late night ride to the store.

My other neighbors do the same, ask for cigarettes and even send over their young kids to ask me for them. They ask to borrow my boyfriends PlayStation controller, and owe us money from months ago.

My daughter is three and I will get random knocks on the door for her. I was getting ready for my final earlier this month and got a knock on the door asking if she could come out and play. First off, I never let her out unsupervised, as she is 3, otherwise if I wasn’t busy I would have obliged. I sternly said I had urgent plans and she could not come out and play at that time as she was going over her grandmothers.
They knocked again the other day and as I had plans I just didn’t answer.

33468,"AITA for putting an autistic child in timeout for an hour?. I have a 3 year old but this story isn't about her. I will say, though, that for her, we have a time out system when she misbehaves where we put her in our dining room which is baby gated off.

Three nights ago I was babysitting for my friend. She has an 8 year old autistic son. I was only babysitting for two hours and it was rough. I have a new puppy who isn't acclimated to people (especially children) yet, so I keep her in a cage in my kitchen when we have company over.

The boy I was babysitting kept pestering the dog. Throwing a ball at the cage so it'll bounce off, sticking his fingers in her cage, shaking the cage, etc. I told the boy that it wasn't nice to tease the dog like this and she's nervous around children, and to please leave her alone. But he would persist. My puppy would yelp really loud scratch at the cage to get out, much to his amusement.

Our main floor has no doors at all, so it's not like I could have closed the dog off somewhere. I have carpets on my second floor and I couldn't bring the cage up there. Despite my attempts to keep the boy with me so we can play or watch television, his attention was strictly on teasing the dog. 

No amount of bribing with candy or toys or promises of playing so and so game would get him away, so I kept him in the ""time out zone"". First for five minutes (usually with our daughter we do a minute per years of age), then I let him out to see what happens, and he went right back to the dog, so I called it quits and he remained in time out for the rest of my babysitting session, about 50 minutes or so. I was in the adjacent room so I could see him, it's not like I left him there alone to his own devices. He had toys and etc.

He comes from a religious background and has those common non-violent but homophobic attitudes (gays shouldn't adopt, pride parades and protests are unnecessary, hate the sin love the sinner, yada yada). He's also ""bi-curious"" by his own admission and obviously working through some stuff. Some of his opinions have changed since we've been messaging and we do talk about other non-political stuff, but he struggles with mental issues and can be manipulative.

9130,"AITA for “stealing” two activations at my carrier job from a coworker?. Hey y’all,

I work for a carrier store, and yesterday I had a shift from 3PM to 9PM. Some customers came in (Spanish speakers), and I’m the only one there who speaks Spanish fluently, but I was stuck with customers so I couldn’t help them right away. My coworker (CO) goes to help them but they spoke very broken French (French area) so they didn’t get very far past the point of the customer wanting an iPhone.

Long story short, the customer backs away about three times and I had finished with my customers so I went to help CO with the customers. I had to explain everything in Spanish because they didn’t understand much, the plan, the phone, etc. I ended up convincing his wife to join as well, making it two activations instead of one. 

CO has to leave as his shift ended and he asks me to do one of them on his account so it counts towards his quota, and that we’ll split it 50/50 on the commission. I agree and CO leaves. 

It took me way longer to finish the two than I thought, and as the only holder of a credit card was the customer’s wife, I did it to her name as she was present and only wanted a SIM plan. No biggie. Problem is, she’s a new resident here so her credit isn’t the best so if I close out on her activation FIRST, I’m double hitting her credit report.

So I end up doing it to my account twice, and I text my CO and tell him that next activation, I’ll do it to his name and that he just send me the commission.

Now another coworker (CO2) has been blasting my phone because I apparently am stealing sales and that what I did was very asshole-ish, and that if I did it to him, he’d deck me.

My manager said it was entirely okay what I did, and since he knows that one of the two activations is “his”, he’ll cut him some slack if the quota grid is in the red for him.

TL;DR Coworker finishes his shift after talking to a few customers for ONE phone, I end up convincing them for TWO, I text him and tell him I’ll split the commission with him, I couldn’t do it to his account, so the quota grid only reflects as if I did both, other coworker has been verbally abusive by text.

I dunno, I understand why ppl might need them, I just don’t feel like I need them myself. maybe because I’ve always been pivotal to the proceedings (only been to very close family members)  it has never felt like my time to say goodbye or like closure or anything, I’ve felt like instead it’s about supporting others in their grief, and public speaking, making sure things run smoothly etc. If he doesn’t have the kind of relationship where he wants to do that for his step family then that’s fine too.",0,0,0,0,1
18846,"AITA for ratting my friend/coworker out to management?. So, some context. 

I work at a Starbucks, and have been for about a year now. This other girl, let's call her M, has been working for about the same amount of time. She's a bit older than I am [I'm 20, M and she's 24] and we are super good friends. It's not uncommon for us to go for a beer after work, as we usually do night shifts together. 

There's this other girl, let's call her J. J and M are about the same age, and J started working here around December. Now one thing about Starbucks (at least, where I come from) is that dating other baristas are not allowed, because it always leads to tension and drama. I've experienced this firsthand in my previous store, and it was a really awful experience. 

So the tea is that M and J have been having sexual relations for the past month or so. M told me last night when she was quite drunk. The other problem is that M has a boyfriend and J has a girlfriend. I really didn't know what to say, because I think infidelity is a pretty awful thing to do when you're not in an open relationship and I didn't want to go through the whole ordeal that is workplace romance again.

I personally decided to put an end to this. I didn't know what else to do.

I talked to my assistant manager the next day. She went really quiet and told me she appreciated my confidence and that she would talk to our store manager to see if M or J can be transferred to another store, and that they can handle it in a private, respectful manner.

Currently, I live in the home we purchased together as equal partners and have been paying the full mortgage and all the bills. I do not know where they are living, though I know they usually come by once a week when I’m at work to collect mail or to take items. We have been communicating over the buyout process of the home, the furniture, and whatnot but they will not tell me when they are coming by or what they are taking out of the house, insisting that they don’t have to. Almost all of their items were packed up and placed by the front door by them when we first split and just recently I moved all the boxes into the garage  as they had just sat collecting dust and blocking the entryway for months. When I moved the boxes I received several messages from my Ex asking  never to touch their stuff again. Recently, there was an incident when the ex and their friend came by the house after I sent a courtesy message to my Ex the night before stating I would be at work but I had a “guest” (my girlfriend) sleeping over until noon.  They came in the house at nine and woke up my girlfriend  by banging on the bedroom door to “get some clothes”. All my exes clothes have been left untouched by me since the split and remain in the closet and dresser.

So I had a school dance a few years ago and in my country we do this traditional dance at the beginning and people ask each other out. I decided not to do it because 1) no one asked me out and I’m too shy to do it myself 2) my friends weren’t doing it either so i couldn’t do it with them.

I was at school helping with the decorations with my friends and getting ready for the dance when suddenly this girl comes in and says X is dancing with me. I say no way, I’m not dancing with anyone and he never talked to me about it. She keeps insisting but I flat out refuse, I mean this guy never uttered a word about the dance to me so I don’t understand why he thought I would agree right away.

It’s not like we knew each other very well, I sat next to him one day in computer lab and he started talking to me and while I clearly wasn’t very interested in the conversation he kept talking to me and I didn’t know how to tell him I’m not interested.

41704,"AITA for not wearing white to my wedding?. So I've just gotten engaged and, where I come from, brides wear red traditional dress on their wedding day.

However, in my fiancé's culture, brides typically wear white. He's the last in his family to get married/there have been **many** weddings in the recent past (sisters, cousins, etc.) and they've all worn white wedding dresses.

We were recently at a family BBQ/engagement party and some of the women in the family asked me what I'd be wearing, since the wedding is probably going to combine each of our traditions. I told them about the red traditional dress and one of them remarked 'way to one up all of us, haha'. I thought it was just a joke but when I was bringing out some food I overheard her talking to another relative, saying 'she says she's going to be wearing red - who wears red to their own wedding?' And the other relative replied that it seemed attention-seeking since this is the last wedding there will be for a while.

The thing is, white is typically reserved for people who are mourning (we don't wear black for funerals). I'm not superstitious, or to be honest all that close to my culture (bit of a blend), but I'm culturally different from my fiancé and would love to respect that. I talked to my mom and she says I should maybe consider wearing a different colour (maybe pink or something closer to white). She's coming from the POV that in our culture, respecting your in-laws is key (though I don't necessarily agree with this part). So I'm kind of torn.

My GF has been in her job for a couple of years now and she occasionally goes out with her colleagues.

One of her colleagues had a habit of flirting with other colleagues and generally men around her, which makes  her colleagues side eye her because she was engaged and even recently bought an apartment with her fiancé. Though it’s none of my business this type of stuff infuriates me as infidelity has ravaged my family in the past. HIV transmissions, resulting in family living with HIV or dying from it. I know this is worst case scenario stuff but it has effected more people close to me than I care to recount. 

My Gf gave her benefit of the doubt as she is more relaxed with flirting as a form of cheating. Fast forward a year and this colleague is now full on publicly fondling with one particular colleague and is admitting she wants to leave fiancé for the guy at work. 

I have been hearing about this colleagues antics for a while and I decide to anonymously  tell the fiancé to which he says they split a few weeks back (I’m assuming he found out). I was going to recommend he gets checked as I am unsure he is unaware how long her antics have been going on for, but I decided against it as I didn’t want to give away too much information. 

Problem is my GF would not like the idea of me having told him this. Though I made sure to keep it entirely anonymous and given by the response the dude didn’t seem interested in knowing who I was so I don’t see any harm done.

It’s not that he can’t be in the same room as me while I do it but I don’t like it when people just stand there and watch. I’ve told him many times the specific reason I don’t like this is because my abusive father used to use dishes not being done to his standard as an excuse to exact abuse. He would find any spec real or imaginary. So when someone stands over my shoulder and watches me today as an adult it causes an involuntary stress response. I asked him to just walk away for a few minutes and he refused.

ORIGINAL POST:

I really don’t think I’m the asshole here, but his friends are saying I am so I wanted to get some opinions.

I’ve been a vegan for the past 2 years, whereas my boyfriend is adamant that he would never give up meat. He always complains about how vegan food doesn’t taste as good, isn’t filling etc, and he’s normally not willing to try new things.

Anyway, last night we were on a date at a burger chain. The chain lets you order with an app. He was busy on his phone and told me to order for him, and he wanted a beef burger. I asked which one and he said “I’m busy, you choose.”

I noticed that the restaurant sold the Beyond Burger - if you don’t know, it’s a kind of “fake meat” burger which is designed to be realistic. I’ve heard it’s actually really similar to meat, so I order him one mostly out of interest to see if he’d notice. I got myself a bean burger, so he wouldn’t notice we had the same meal and get suspicious.
The meal arrives and he really loves it! I kept subtly asking him how it was and he said it was great! He even boasted about it being tastier than my “lame” veggie burger.

After we’d paid up, I told him the truth and he was pissed, saying I tricked him and violated his trust etc. But he loved the burger??

35119,"AITA for frequently clowning the extreme Christian sect I broke free from?. Trigger warning: A lot of irreverence here. 

I grew up in a more extreme Christian religion, raised moderately at home and in my communities. But  was still frequently subjected to the more radical believers. One of my parents is actively a fucking nutso and culty. That parent allowed their beliefs to cause me trauma when I was young and I spent years as a child in fear of burning in hell or basically being tortured during the end times. I finally started to assess the church abt 8yo ago and explored other beliefs. 

Something pretty huge happened in my life, and once that shit dropped, the best way I can describe is my spiritual beliefs were yanked out from underneath me; I suddenly “lost faith” with no forewarning. Thankfully being pushed out of the spiritual head bubble allowed me to think w/o the spell. I am agnostic now but with a special personal connection to Hinduism, and have been so for 5yrs now. 

I don’t do these things outside my circles of friends, but, the friends I still have that “believe” have recently responded to my jabs at the sect saying I’m being an asshole for acting like I don’t understand the perspective and like i wasn’t JUST a strong believer under a decade ago. They are not offended, just feel like it’s an asshole move to continuously joke on it. Honestly this is like 18yrs in the making for me LOL. Anyway, here are some things they brought up or reacted to: 

- (they believe in keeping the Sabbath holy Fri night-Sat night.) When my friend mentioned going to church on Sat, I told her, “Fuck that Sabbath shit come do shots instead!” This same friend frequently “violates the Sabbath” herself. 

- Me: “Old Testament God is a vengeful trigger happy asshole.... Nothing like Jesus. I know Joseph isn’t the daddy, buuuut are we really sure God is?”

- [insert hilarious and wildly inappropriate sexual joke about the sect’s prophetess] 

- Getting judgy sometimes towards “believers” who don’t really practice devoutly (they drink, buy things on/watch TV on Sabbath,etc). Bcuz....”Choose ye this day whom ye will serve,” which was beaten into me growing up. To be agnostic I quote scripture *a lot* weirdly 

- I fucking love having debates with some believers (it’s happened maybe 3x) but the positions I take have been closer to the side of radical believers because radicals do FAR LESS picking, which is what makes them extreme. 

If I’m an asshole, boy is it therapeutic as FUCK *and* hilarious to be the asshole here. I just feel like I have such a deep and inseparable history with this sect, so I don’t feel bad clowning it...in fact I feel motivated.

TL/DR at the end

So my parents own a franchise but my dad is the only one who works in the shop most of the time. We're pretty strapped for cash so on public holidays he gets me and my mum (his wife) to work in the shop so he can save money. 

I suffer from mental illness and have previously struggled to finish the full day of work or go in. My dad has only ever put me on last minute which is why I usually struggle to make it in at all or on time. He has previously put me on the roster but has never told me about it because it ""should be my responsibility to check"" even though he doesn't pay me minimum wage (apart from one time) and doesn't think of me as an actual worker.

A little back story on my relationship with my dad. We don't really talk at all and if we do it usually ends in a fight. He has previously been physically abusive but has backed off and stuck to verbal abuse now. He has said im a disappointment to the family, I'll end up living off benefits, and all sorts of stuff like that because of my mental illness.  He strongly believes that I should be better by now (i have been diagnosed for almost 4 years and been through counselling/inpatient) and that I need to stop using ""this mental illness thing as an excuse all the time"".

I have always been motivated to work, i just struggle when i have little to no warning. I have been putting my resume into multiple places and have now gotten a job but have been relying on my dad for work since I've been told I couldn't put my resume into different places because dad might need me for a shift. Before I accepted this new job I was constantly asking for more shifts at dads work but he has always said he will put me on for the next weekend and then never do it. He is extremely sexist and I've heard him say he would rather not have any women working in the shop (I'm female).

As you know Christmas is coming up and dads shop will be getting busier so I know hr will want to put me on for the public holidays and Sundays so he doesn't have to pay people as much. Would I be the asshole if I refused to work on the public holidays and force him to put someone else on?

15401,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to not go to a strip club without me?. So my girlfriend (22f) and I (22m) were talking early about some friends (both males) upcoming birthdays that take place the day before mine. She was talking about how they really wanted to go to a strip club to celebrate. The problem is that I will more than likely have to work that weekend in which case I would not be able to go. I told her this and told her that I would not be comfortable with her going to a strip club without me also being there. My reasoning is that this is a place of business designed for sexual arousal, whether you are into that same sex or not. She states that it is just something to do for fun and something that she had always wanted to experience. I told her that if she went without me I would be very upset with her to which she responded by saying that she is still planning to go, with or without me.

Taking it to the next hypothetical level we started talking about bachelor and bachelorette parties. I stated that I would ask my fiancé not to have strippers and that I would consider it to be cheating if they disregarded my request, as they would be inviting men to come and get naked for them and their sexual pleasure, even if they don’t make any sexual contact. She thinks of it more as a tradition and believes it is not a big deal. 

So am/would  I be the asshole in not allowing her to go with her friends and/or getting upset at her if she chooses to ignore my request? 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your responses. Myself and my SO agreed to put this here in order to come to an agreement on this subject to help strengthen our relationship, I understand I may not have worded it in a way that would reflect that.

22766,"AITA for refusing to give my parents a portion of my salary?. I (21 M) started working part time when I was 16 and signed up for a scholarship bond with the government for 5 years. In this 5 years I have to be fully committed to working for the government, not allowed to work any other jobs. The pay is decent, I am earning a bit higher than the average yearly income in my country in my first year of the bond. I did this for 2 main reasons - to be financially independent and to pay for my dog’s surgery and medication. He suffers from a severe slip disc and had to go for surgery. 

My parents gambled away all their savings for my education back when I was still a kid. I could not get into a University due to financial problems and therefore had to work. My plan now is to support myself, take the load off my parents’ back (Pocket money, school fees, food etc.) and save up so that I can get my degree after my 5 year bond ends. 

However, it was rather difficult to save money because my parents demand me to give 1/4 of my salary to them every month. I know I am supposed to be giving back to them for what they have provided me with all my life but the thing is, both of them now are well to do with NO financial problems at all. Their reasoning is I have to give them as a form of respect (I am Asian) and I obliged. 

Few months past and due to this I see myself getting nowhere. Having to take care of all my own expenses at such a young age, I was already stressed enough. I am only able to save a little bit every month (after struggling the whole month) and I snapped. I told them that this is unfair for me and reasoned that I am actually trying to help myself and my future here. They scolded me, told me I was unfilial, told all their friends ‘their’ side of the story and now I am on bad terms with them. 

AITA for this? There is no other way for me to save and I do not take a single cent from them, at least not for the past 3-4 years.

42197,"AITA for telling my friend/roomate that I will not take her son to work with me?. Hi,

I will  try to make a long text post kind of short. 

Some background info: My friend, A, let me move in with her when I was facing homelessness this august. I agreed to babysit her kid on my one off day (Tuesday) after school and she agreed to let me bring my dog. I pay rent and sleep in her dining room (it's a one bedroom apartment and I was desperate and alone in a new city)

Tuesday mornings I usually pick up an extra shift at work making sure I am home by 2 pm to pick up her son from school. I babysit him while A is at work and there have been no issues.  

Since last Thursday Chicago teachers have been on strike and school has been out. she has had him at his dad's house while she has been going to school/work. I only saw him twice last week. 

Btw, she only works two days a week and has school on the same days. versus my schedule of a combination of work + school 6 days a week. Tuesday is my only day off and I usually run errands in the morning if I don't pick up an extra shift.

so today she asked me if I was busy and I told her I had to go to work in the morning to do some paperwork that was due yesterday. She then asked me if I could take him to work with me. I told her no. 

For relevance I work at a hospital, in the kitchen. I told her no because I don't have kids and taking her kid to my job is not what I signed up for. As a parent, if teachers are on strike and you can't get a sitter you need to figure that shit out.

I came back from work and running a few errands and she tried to guilt me (and flip the script). It went something like this :

A: ""It's a good thing I stayed home from school, or he would have been home alone.""

c: ""I told you no""

A: "" you said that you might be able to...""

c: "" I told you no. why didn't you take him to school with you?""

A: "" I can't take him to school, kids aren't allowed in the building; it's a hospital. At least your school is a real school. He would have sat there and did nothing. I don't understand why you couldn't take him.""

c: "" I went to work, not school.""

 I don't mind helping my friends out but I feel like she crossed a line. If I had a child I would never ask my friends to take my kid to work with them. No matter the reason they are going. Am I an asshole?. Am I the asshole?","NTA

As a parent you have to figure things out or make sacrifices. You agreed to Tuesday afternoons and you do that.

I was not around the day when they got together and I didn't learn they were dating until a week or two later. The only reason I found out was because of an meme that one of them posted.

I was out with my best friend in the world and her husband at a chain restaurant that is not fast food.

The staff apologized and stated that the over seasoned food would not be on the bill and instead he would just be charged for the fries and the drinks.

18643,"AITA for never calling my roommate beautiful?. I'd say my (23F) roommate (23F) has always been a very straightforward and somewhat blunt person. Some relevant examples: once in high school we were at a lunch table with other friends when she out of nowhere remarked that she had never thought I was (physically) beautiful, but she could see it all of a sudden. I was neither hurt nor flattered, since I had never sought to impress her. I also didn't (and don't) think she was beautiful either, and to me that is completely natural. We all find some people beautiful and some people, not beautiful. I did however think she had been rude to say something like that, as I imagined some people might be hurt by the first part of her remark. She will also sometimes say to me that someone she sees on social media is ugly - which I also think is rude even though that person is not around, and especially because I have not solicited her opinion on the person's appearance, and I have told her as much. But generally, I have simply taken these tendencies to mean she is the kind of person who appreciates honesty. 

&#x200B;

While getting ready in front of the mirror, she'll often say to herself how beautiful she is and gas herself up - and I'm all for that lol, remind yourself that you're the shit everyday. But a few times, the last time a few days ago, she's followed up by asking me why I never call her beautiful, which is true. I always jokingly brush it off and end the conversation, but I realise that most people might respond to that question by calling her beautiful (am I wrong about that?). However, I feel very fake/uncomfortable saying things to people that aren't genuine; I would rather not say anything at all. I feel like even if I tried, she'd figure out I was being fake right away. She also seems to have a great amount of self-confidence, which makes me think it doesn't really matter to her whether I think she's beautiful or not. Perhaps she has noticed me call other people beautiful, but I don't think I do that that often enough for it to seem like she is the only one I do not call beautiful. I don't hesitate to compliment her features/outfits, but I have never called her overall face or body beautiful.

I'd try to make plans that fit with his schedule, and each time he'd deny them. A few months ago (give or take) he came over and said he couldn't sleep over because he had family things to deal with. Which I was fine with. After he left I was scrolling through Instagram when I saw his friends post.

He went to sixflags.

He HAD no 'family issues' he just wanted to go to sixflags and not hang out with me.

I was hurt but I dealt with it. Things happen, whatever. And the cycle of me trying to get him to come over and him denying.

Timeskip to this week. 

I asked J to come over or at least to six flags, as I was going on Friday. He said yes and I got excited, I was finally going to see my best friend again.

We talked the whole week about how excited we were to see each other.

Then he did it.

He asked if he could bring all of his friends, who I don't know, with him. I asked why and ""aren't we going together?"" 

He was never intending to come and hang out with me at sixflags. He told me that straight to my face. And I'm not going to lie. I cried. I bawled my eyes out. I sat there my head in my friends lap and sobbed.

This man got my hopes up and then shattered them. He's done this and broken my heart more times then I can count but this just broke me. I told him he was a dick and what he was doing is manipulative blocked him on all social media.

I told him that if he wants to keep this friendship (which he was very adament that he wanted to) he'd have to try more. I didnt block him on my phone because I want to give him one last chance to fix things.

Now my family is on my side saying he's an ass but the main problem is myself. My heart says I'm an ass for dropping him but my brain says I'm in the right.

So reddit AITA?

Tldr: Best friend refuses to hang out with me and keeps ditching me. We make a plan to meet up at sixflags and he brings his friends as he had no intent to actually hang out with me.

26784,"AITA for not pitching in on the grief basket for a coworker?. For context, a coworker's relative recently passed away due to complications from breast cancer. Some of our colleagues pitched in and put together a ""grief basket"" so to speak. In other words, they got flowers,  a card, some items and so forth and put them together. I didn't do this but I did sign a small message of sympathy because I know what it's like to lose a loved one to cancer. It fucking sucks.

Apparently that wasn't good enough. A good majority of my coworkers all bought something for the coworker, but a few others did not. I'm sorry, but I hardly know this person. I'm not spending money on some extravagant grief basket when a sympathy note suffices well enough. I would never, ever expect someone to do that for me so why would I do it? It's completely unnecessary. That aside, I feel like I'm being singled out because I've been getting passive aggressive remarks regarding my decision but none of my other coworkers who also decided not to do so are getting these comments.

43394,"WIBTA If I stop my father from voting because he has dementia?. My father has dementia. 

It’s in the middle stages, anything from good days (not great days) to very bad days. 

He was having a good day and my mom was busy in the garden or something when a door knocker came by to register people to vote with absentee ballots if they needed one. 

My dad isn’t planning any travel but told the guy he needed one anyways for some reason.  When I came to visit he’d filled it out and wants us to send it in. 

He’s super suggestible lately and his political opinions oscillate a lot based on what he’s been told most recently. Example: If he just saw something on FOX he’ll talk all day about how big government is robbing good, hardworking citizens blind. 

If he just saw something on MSNBC he can just as passionately argue we need to reclaim the means of production and take power back for the blue collar man. 

And, again, anything in between. I can’t tell what he actually thinks and what’s the dementia talking. 

He’s always been a moderate, with some very left leaning opinions and some right leaning opinions. I think I knew him well enough to know what his opinions were. But it isn’t for me to decide his politics for him or try and guess what he’d want them to be. 

I’m thinking I just shouldn’t ever submit the absentee ballot application. Obviously we wouldn’t drive him to the polls either. I can’t imagine he’d stand on the line for that long. He doesn’t have that kind of patience anymore. 

My mother thinks that’s wrong and that if he was lucid enough to decide he wants to vote and fill it out, then we have to let him, even if his voting decisions could be totally arbitrary. 

But I’m conflicted for the same reason. We have no idea if, in his total right state of mind, he’d want to vote however he’ll end up voting. 

Would I be the asshole if I just don’t send the application in and don’t drive him to the polls?. Am I the asshole?",YTA dementia is no grounds for disqualifying someone from voting. Especially the manifestation you describe. Plus it didnt even stop trump from winning the presidency.,1,1,0,0,0

They’re lovely parents and I know they want grandchildren. It’ll make them so happy.

But I just don’t want kids. I love kids and I love teaching (currently my profession) and I think I’d make a great dad but I also love myself and feel like it would really deteriorate my quality of life.

Even now they’re pretty poor and don’t really have any retirement funds (I’m secretly putting 5K into a money market account every year just for them for when they retire). 

Now that I have money and have worked so hard as they have inspired me to do so, I just want to enjoy myself and am too afraid I won’t be able to. I want to be able to retire early. I want to live stress free without kids. I don’t want to be scraping for money because of them.

My partner and I have already won the first week, and are planning to play the second week as well.  Would we be the assholes of our team if we insisted on playing each week to the championships if we keep winning?

5871,"AITA for not wanting to buy food that I will not eat?. I currently live with three others in an apartment and have done so for the past four months. I genuinely believed before the fall semester started that I would be cooking fairly often. Unfortunately, laziness led to me eating out for almost every meal. As time went on, I would stop going on grocery runs because I literally never ate at home.

Now, it's spring semester and my schedule is actually extremely busy. I only eat out. I'm refusing to go on a Costco run to buy food from a list for my roommates.

Than as we were talking about the baby, I asked how we were going to tell people, and she said she wanted to surprises people at Christmas and that she already told her study partner guy friend about the news.

Yesterday I had to say goodbye to my 14 year old dog whom I loved dearly.  She was my dog at my dad’s house and the first dog I ever trained and took care of myself.  After saying my final goodbyes to her I was very upset and was crying.  My mom knew my dog was being put to sleep and that I had to say goodbye to her.  I went to my moms house since I was on her side of town and I haven’t been able to visit recently due to being busy with work and school.  As soon as my mom saw that I was crying she looked at me and said, “Oh stop it.” in the most dismissive tone.  I simply replied, “Fuck you.” and turned around and walked out of her bedroom.  I stayed at her house for 3 hours after that to see my little sisters and my mother never even bothered to leave her room to say anything to me.  

She had my sister tell me she wanted me to go talk to her in her room upstairs and I said, no and that I was not talking to her until she came to apologize to me for being rude.  I left without saying anything else to my mom and went back to my apartment.

Today my mom called me and told me that I needed to apologize to her for being so rude yesterday.  I said, I wouldn’t because she was so dismissive of my feelings and unsupportive of me first.  She responded by saying that I didn’t support her when her dad (my grandpa) passed away 3 years ago.  I told her I wasn’t going to argue about this with her and ended our phone call.

That said, my work is planning an event right now that we do every year, and one of my coworkers got an email from a music licensing company about getting rights to music for our show. She thought this was a little strange, and forwarded me the email to take a look. It was peppered with spelling errors--including the spelling of our company name--and was addressed to someone who doesn't even work here and hasn't for years.

The customer service person was perfectly polite and let me know that yes, they do occasionally reach out to encourage events and organizations to license their music instead of (illegally) using it without asking. 

I hesitated, but after I thanked her I told her that they should let their people know to edit emails before sending them, because the reason I was suspicious of the email I got was because of all the errors.

I work data entry for an insurance firm, so people in this office are usually bored out of their fucking minds, but this conversation caused a buzz like I've never seen before. Speculation on who did it and hilarious eye witness descriptions have been the topic for days and show no sign of dying down. I initially kept participation to a minimum - overwhelmed with anxiety, but now i've started to settle into a weird sense of pride and joined in the banter.

I don’t feel like I’ve done anything wrong but my parents (and particularly my French teacher) are not happy with me. 

I put my 14 year old dog down last Monday. I don’t remember living without her (I’m 16 now). I’ve been extremely lonely without her and it’s been hard, obviously. When I went back to school last Wednesday I could barely focus on anything. My French teacher called me up to his desk during class to talk about a test I had missed, I told him I was sorry about not contacting him but he didn’t want to hear any sort of apology. He told me I should have immediately contacted him after my absence. I told him why I was absent hoping he would understand my reason, but he didn’t at all. He basically said, “I’m sorry, but you need to take responsibility for your work.” 

I’ve been upset about it ever since. I told my mother and she agreed with him. It was just so much to deal with and I was getting pressured by so many people to “just be normal again”. I sure as hell was neglecting schoolwork because I just couldn’t focus on anything. Now I’m worried I’ve ruined whatever relations I have with him. I’ve always been a decent student in his class before this (grade of 90% or so).

29997,"WIBTA if I insisted on sharing a room with my boyfriend?.  

Honestly hoping for an answer on this as I’m pretty conflicted. 

A little background: I grew up in a Catholic family. I’m honestly not very devout at the moment, but most of my siblings are in some respect and subscribe to the church's ideas on premarital sex, drugs, etc. etc. My EXTREMELY catholic older sister lives a few states away and all my siblings and their kids get together at her house once a year for holidays. This year, it’s landing on Easter. 

I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for 6 years now. Up until now, every year I’ve gone I have 100% abided by the “your house, your rules” doctrine and the BF and I have slept many nights on couches or with the nieces and nephews in their rooms. Granted, there is totally an extra guest bedroom for us to use, my sister is just entirely against the idea of two unmarried people sharing a bed. 

We’ve been dating for 6 years now and currently share an apartment together, this is a serious relationship. We also have ZERO plans of getting married anytime in the foreseeable future for personal reasons. 

I absolutely understand that we have to be lenient and respect the rules of the house, but honestly, guys it really sucks. I’m getting older now, and I feel like my relationship isn’t regarded as “valid” because we aren’t married. It isn’t at all about the sex! I just want us to have our own space and be treated like the other adult couples on these 4+ day annual get-togethers. I don’t want to be a 27 year old sleeping on a damn couch or in a trundle bed with my niece a few years from now. Other family couples my age and younger can share rooms because they’re married, of course. 

We could rent a hotel, but she lives in the country so it’d be at least a 45min drive away. 

WIBTA if I approached this with my sister? It’s a delicate situation because she’s so vehemently against us sharing a room, I think it would be a really serious conversation. I don’t want to disrespect her opening her house to us which is why I've held out till now, but I’m not sure at what point I put my foot down on being treated like an adult in an adult relationship.

You are in your rights to want your relationship to be taken seriously and to sleep next to your partner instead on small beds with children. Talking to her about this is reasonable.

**Could you argue to sis that you have what is equivalent to a common law marriage? I know only a few states accept this and the rules are not so clear but this could be a way to legitimize your wants and express to her how you two view the relationship - long-term partners who haven't said an oath yet even though the sentiment is there and you clearly have shown a big level of commitment.**",0,0,0,1,0

For one of my classes I have to create a documentary. I live in Chicago and homelessness is very concentrated in the city so I thought it would be interesting to make a documentary asking different homeless people to tell me a story. Just any story that came to them either about their life, someone they know, or they can just make something up.

It's only a concept right now but Im worried its wrong for someone who has my privilege to make something like this. I was thinking about paying them but I work minimum wage and don't know how much would be enough. (I was thinking somewhere around $10 because I want to interview a lot of people.) I would use a good camera provided by my school and ask before filming if it would be okay to film them and if it would be okay to show their face.

If I create a documentary about homeless people telling me a story for my college would I be an asshole?

So me and my 2 friends started doing friends vacations. They are a couple and I'm the ""third wheel"".  In September we spoke about my birthday and how I wanted to go to another city.  Well me and my best friends gf(julie, not her real name) have close birthdays so it was presented we do a joint bday trip.

Julie wanted to plan this so we relented and let her. Julie is not the best at time management nor planning but we still agreed since she seemed passionate about planning.

Fast forward to the beginning of january I haven't heard anything about this trip and as it's getting closer I start looking for something for me assuming they decided to not go. We meet up in the second week of January where I discussed that I had been looking and all the details I had just short of showing the houses.

Julie's gf(mya again not real name), my best friend, had said she didn't wanna see houses until feburary due to her moving.  I agreed understanding that moving is a big process. However she kept saying i wasnt sharing any houses or details. I informed her of what she had said where she relented as she couldnt remember saying it but knew it sounded like something she would have said.

Up until this point i had made up a decent budget rough estimate of times the whole 9 yards. They didnt like the dates because they said julie started a new job and they only wanted to go for saturday and sunday. I stated since its 2 hours away i would like to go leaving on Friday coming back on a monday. Not super long but long enough to feel like I went.

My boyfriend ""John"" and I have been together for about 2 years and we live together (both in mid 20's).  He's very introverted and it was something I had to get used to (and to be honest it sometimes makes me wonder if we're really compatible in the long-term, but that's a separate issue). He doesn't really enjoy going out to bars and clubs; he'll occasionally tolerate a dinner party at a friend's house or something but it takes a bit of convincing.  He's not cripplingly shy, but he's not really up for meeting new people and would prefer quiet nights in by himself or with close mutual friends. He also doesn't really enjoy hiking, museums or sightseeing in the city or things like that, which is a bit of a bummer but I've learned to just find other friends who do enjoy those activities.  He will occasionally give in on special occasions or if there is a special event going on. 

Two weeks ago I've been casually bringing up the idea of going to city (~2 hours away) over the weekend.

A few days after I brought up the idea, a friend of his he hasn't spoken to in a while hit him up.  She was in town for the weekend with a few other of their mutual friends and wanted to see if he wanted to hang out over the weekend.  He agreed, and I was totally fine with it until I later learned that they were going to hang out in the same city I had suggested.  I asked him why he said yes to her invitation, when he had all these excuses when I suggested the same thing.  He said he hadn't seen this friend in a while so he was willing to put up with the drive/weather since this was a sort of rare occasion.  He said he wished she wanted to hang out closer, but he'll do what she wants since they don't see each other much.

thanks everyone for keeping me company last night when I was sad. What I didn’t mention and probably should have is while I do have a very high sex drive I was in a r/DeadBeadrooms marriage for 10 years. I spent a lot of time feeling rejected especially in hotel rooms. 

Bf did indeed wake up apologetic and made it up to me this morning. :)

Those of you saying we need to talk though are right. Especially about his new role as step-parent which is complicated.***

Bf (31) and I (f36) have been having a heard time lately. He moved in middle of last year with me and my 5yo, he has no kids of his own and adjusting to life with a child hasn’t been easy. He’s great with my kid and so helpful round the house but our once outstanding sex life has taken a massive hit due to a recent spell of difficult behaviour from my child and his inability to help/have an opinion on what I should do.
I knew he’d been struggling and I’ve been grumpy as hell lately as I work full time and also have other family commitments (sick mom and Grandma) so my free time is literally zero. 
I managed to convince my mom to have my kid overnight and booked a night in a hotel I can’t really afford in an effort to spend some quality time and in particular so we could have sex. We were both very clear that’s what we wanted. Bf even asked me to pack my sex toys and I brought a sexy outfit to wear.
When we got to the hotel they had messed up our booking (we were meant to have a suite with lake views but have ended up in a tiny twin room with only a sky light) but we got past it and decided to make the best of the evening. 
We did have sex when we got here (bf called it round 1) then we had dinner and went back up to the room. 
Bf had said that he wanted to fuck my ass which I was thrilled about because it’s been ages since we had proper dirty sex. I went in to the bathroom to get ready and when I came out he was asleep. I tried to wake him up but he just got grumpy and said I’m never happy no matter what. I’m always complaining about everything he says. It’s now at the point where even if he woke up we probably wouldn’t have sex because we’re so annoyed with each other. 
I know he’s tired, I am too but I’m so disappointed! It’s 2300 and I’m watching a shit movie on tv while he snores in the twin next to me.

I reacted by saying that was incredibly immature and it was shitty to throw away a good living situation because of emotions.

45068,"AITA for kicking someone out of Fantasy Football and not refunding their entry fee. Last year I decided to start a fantasy football league with a group of my coworkers. Everyone was asked if they would be interested and willing to play for money, which everyone was okay with. Almost everyone was incredibly active and cared about the league, so much so that we decided to keep it going. The one exception was one inactive person. Let’s call him ‘Homer’.

Turns out, Homer didn’t really know what to do and lost interest in the league last year. He consistently failed to start a full line-up and left people in that were injured or on bye. Net result, he finished dead last in the league and was the butt of many jokes and frustrations because some people got free wins while others didn’t.

I went to Homer in August and told him I would not be inviting him back for this year. He was immediately upset and wanted to continue, even almost begging, to which I told him ‘fine, but you have to always start a lineup and you cannot forget to update it or else I’ll have to kick you’

Homer was pretty good at the start of the season, but I had to remind him several times to update his roster and finally when I didn’t, once again had the same issue as last season. For you fantasy guys/gals out there, he started Will Dissly for 2 weeks after he was put on the IR and last week failed to sub out Mahomes and OJ Howard, who were both out.

After last week, I had enough of him not trying and, as LM, took the team away from him and gave it to someone who actually follows football.  It took Homer until today at 11:50 AM (almost 2 hours after the morning game deadline to edit your roster) to notice he didn’t have a team. His immediate response was ‘that isn’t fair to do mid-season, I thought you would kick me at the end of the season. I want my money back’ to which I replied ‘no, it isn’t fair to everyone who is trying to have someone not caring and following close enough to manage their team. You allow for free wins against you and it ruins the competition for everyone.’

79272,"AITA for wanting my stepdad to do basic household tasks. 

Context here, I’m fifteen and live with my mum and stepdad who treats me like his own daughter down to being the most annoying person ever. At home I generally take care of myself and do general cleaning downstairs because I come home first. But my job around the house is cleaning the kitchen and doing the dishes which I get allowance for, I am fine with doing this I don’t mind cleaning up after all three of us because i get allowance and obviously it’s doing my part in the house.

The reason I have a problem is because my stepdad is extremely lazy, he’s the typical man who thinks occasionally washing up and doing tiny things is the second coming of Jesus for me and my mum. He blatantly refuses to do simple things like put rubbish in the bin and move things one inch to a container. It’s started to get really frustrating because it’s classic sexism, he’s always been looked after by his mother and since he’s moved from her house to ours it’s become an absolute mess. I know my mum likes it clean and I don’t mind putting in effort to clean for her even if I wasn’t given an allowance but because of my stepdad I have to put in over forty minutes work once I get home to get the kitchen looking decent.

One of my good friends hosted a party at his house a few weeks ago, about 50 of us attended and he made a Spotify playlist for the party. 
The only rule was it had to be dancing music, everybody put music on and so we had the playlist. 

The party starts and we put the playlist on shuffle and we're all dancing along, until this one song comes up,  I have no clue what genre it was and to be honest it was kinda crappy.

Somebody in the crowd shouts nextnextdoor everyone agrees and we pick the next song. I wanna point out that there was a few songs that we skipped as well. so it was not just her music we skipped past. 

Turns out it was her bands music and she wanted to see what we thought, well because of how badly we reacted to it she left the party crying, she has now blocked alot of people on Facebook and is mad that nobody liked her song.

So we have two weddings on the same day, ceremony at the same time, and nether my wife or I want to go to either wedding alone. Her arguments are solid with being her brother trumps my cousin as far as immediate vs. extended family, and my cousin didn't come to our wedding while not only did her brother come, but did a reading at the ceremony so to her it's kind of a no brainer. I disagree for a few reasons

* My cousin's wedding will literally be 10 minutes down the road from our home, while the brother's wedding is over an hour drive away
* This is her brother's second marriage, and to a woman he was dating for a few weeks before proposing to, who he started dating only a relatively short time after getting divorced, all of those feel (to me) like reasons not to go
* My wife for the most part isn't a fan of her own family. She gets on well enough with her own siblings but go much past that and she almost hates them (very few of her extended family was even invited to our wedding) while I love pretty much all of my family, immediate and extended.

1486,"AITA for not consoling the choreographer who mentioned her deeply personal issue out of the blue in the middle of a rehearsal?. I was trained to leave my shit at the door the second I step onto the dance floor. From the time class, rehearsal or a performance begins until we pack up and leave, I’m all about work. I can’t help but feel like I'm wasting precious time if say, small chit-chat turns into a 3-minute gab fest when we only have two hours to get the choreography down before showtime the next day.

The choreographer herself is a chatterbox, usually about trivial stuff, but I quickly learned to ignore anything she’d say that wasn’t related to the task at hand. A couple times I even started to engage in these trivial conversations with the purpose of interrupting myself just so we could get on with it (a useful tactic to cut the convo short without being the asshole abruptly cutting someone off).

At some point we took a couple minutes to block the space with chairs. During this time she was her usual chatterbox self. Then out of the blue, she mentioned that she used to suffer from anorexia. Then silence. The rest of us stopped what we were doing and looked at her. There was nothing she said a few seconds prior that segued into such a heavy statement. Her face was blank, so for a few long seconds, none of us knew how to react. Did she want sympathy? Was she feeling regret? Or was she casually just sayin’?

Finally someone said something to console her. Then someone else did. I did too, but in a half-assed way, not because I didn’t care. But because I was in work mode and destined to finish the choreography. In fact I remember while everyone stood around silent and awkward, I was the only one setting up the rest of the chairs. On top of that, I walk with a very determined, very heavy heel stomp, which in a very small studio that echoes, makes me stand out. So I probably looked like the total asshole who didn’t care.

I thought about saying something in private to her the next day after the show, but then she mentioned the same thing to one of the dancers who joined us last-minute. Same blank face from the choreographer, same reaction from the dancer. So I just ignored it.

Things I’m annoyed about...

2)My dads wife(don’t really view her as step mom since they got married after brother and I were older) has been overstepping every time she is at the hospital by asking doctors questions before my husband and I can, she got a nicu book and was reading it in front of me without ever offering us to read it, keeps calling herself grandma and her daughter(who has never really spoken to me) calls herself our babies aunt. 

3)My MIL keeps calling the baby “her baby” after being told that I don’t like that. I’ve tried the “your baby is over there”, referring to my husband.

I was originally going to try to anonymously inform the guy's wife and let it resolve on its own, but as time has gone on I've started to feel resentment towards my mother for putting me in a situation where I have to choose which parent's trust to violate. Plus on some level I feel like I need to stand up to my mother and support the man who has put up with her bullshit for the past twenty years.

On one hand I think informing him is the objectively right thing to do, in a void where my parents are identical mannequins and don't have a daughter, but of course that's not the fucking case. On the other hand my step-father has temper issues that might result in physical and/or verbal abuse to those around him, who would be my mother and possibly also my sister.

So we live in a college dorm, and we each have our own key to get into our room, but also, everyone that lives in the dorm has a keycard to get into the building itself. My roommate went to a party, as he does most days, and lost his keycard (but not his room key) during it. This was on Friday, and I already told him I was staying at my girlfriend’s dorm the entire weekend because her roommate went home for the weekend, which rarely happens. At about 1 AM on Friday night/Saturday morning, he texted me that he lost his keycard and wanted me and my girlfriend to grab all our stuff, walk over to my dorm (about ten minutes away), and come sleep at my dorm, so tomorrow morning when he came home I could let him in. Now I did feel bad that he lost his keycard and can’t get a new one till classes start again on Monday, but there are other ways for him to get in the building. For one, he has many friends who live in our building, and he could just text them and ask to be let in. We also have a group chat with everyone in our building (including the RA’s) that people always text asking to be let in when they don’t have their keycard. 
I responded by letting him know that as long as he tried texting the group chat first or asking one of his friends, I’d be totally fine with walking over in the morning to let him in. He was answering kind of weirdly and seemed annoyed, but the next morning he actually did get in just by texting the group chat. 
Later on Saturday, he asked for my girlfriend and I to come eat with him at the dining hall so we could let him back into the building afterwards. My girlfriend has a respiratory infection and we already planned on taking a bus to the city so we could get her medicine at the pharmacy which her doctor prescribed on Friday. Because of this, and because we already planned on getting food in the city together, I said no, but once again suggested he just go with his other friends to eat or text the RA/group chat when he’s done. He never responded back after I said we weren’t going to eat with him. Now, at like 9PM, we saw him somewhere on campus near my girlfriends dorm with his friends, and he was acting extremely cold to us.

6916,"AITA for expecting stepson to do his chores still now that he gas a job. My 17 year old step son loves with dh and I full time. He has been assigned the bare minimum of chores to help the household. Specifically putting the garbage cans to the curb and back, scooping the cat boxes twice a week and unloading the dishwasher every other day. He's is extemely lazy and it's a battle for dh to get him to complete these tasks every week. It is a constant source of stress for dh.

Step son recently got hired to work part time at local fast food restaurant, but hasn't yet started. Dh got home from work last night to find that stepson hadn't done any chores, and instead had been playing video games for the 5 hours since he got home from school. After initially telling him off for it, followed it up with, but it's not your fault there are two other kids who should be doing this stuff too. Meaning our six and nine year old sons.

He then comes upstairs to me and asks why younger sons didn't bring up the cans or unload the dishwasher. My response see was that those weren't their chores, that they did the chores assigned to them. Dh then responded that the younger boys will have to start doing step sons  chores because he got job at fast food restaurant.  He then walked away aggitated without me responding.

So here is my question, am I the asshole to say that it's not the younger kids responsibility to pick up step sons chores because he has a part time job? The younger kids have their own chores, and they are quite frankly more involved and take more time and effort than step sons. Step son still lives here full time and still doesn't pay rent or anything, so he is working just for his own pocket money. I don't think this absolves him of the responsibility of helping to take care of the household.

I've lived here for more than five years so I'm used to city life and I don't expect it to be quiet. I'm used to the sounds of traffic, sirens, and drunk assholes shouting outside (mostly on the weekends) but a 24-hour convenience store and sandwich shop recently opened up right across the street from where I live and the level of drunk shouting and screaming has gone through the fucking roof. It's really bad, you guys.



Packs of drunk assholes chanting Eagles chants at the top of their lungs for twenty minutes at a time and getting in the street, blocking traffic, making drivers trying to go past lay on their horns at two am is something I can handle on weekends because I don't have to work but its EVERY GODDAMN NIGHT and it's killing me.



Sure my apartment is in a somewhat busy area but it was relatively peaceful until that convenience store came in and attracted all of the people who left bars at closing drunk off their ass but who don't want to go home yet. I tried looking up the non-emergency police number but that number is basically only open during regular day/office hours. And I don't see what my apartment management or the convenience store can do about it because these people are technically not in the store when their screaming at the top of their goddamn lungs in the middle of the street.



What I want to do is fill up a bunch of water balloons and keep them in a bowl in my fridge so they're nice and cold and throw them at the shouting people to try to get them to stop. Even if it doesn't get them to stop entirely, I have to think it would make them leave the area at least.

I just kept it to myself. We conceived in the second month and our girl is now a todler.

A few months back we decided we wanted a second baby so the same thing happened, i didn't tell him about my cycle or anything. I really feel the proces of conceiving is something i should worry about alone, so i can protect him and not freak him out to much.

A few days later i took another test and it was negative. I have bled some more and i think i miscarried. I really don't want to get it confirmed (there is no reason i should, it will only hurt more) so i will never be sure it was a false positive or a misscariage.

I’m 29 and have struggled with anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. I still do. However, I forced myself to accomplish things because I simply felt I had to. 

From my experience, more and more kids my brothers age make excuses to do nothing and live off their parents. Granted, we both had abusive childhoods, so I do understand the mental strain of it. However, I did not grow up with these victim praising narratives of decision fatigue and executive order syndrome and all those other excuses to avoid doing shit we don’t wanna do.

I’m still overseas, and my dad just called to tell me he had a massive heart attack. My brother was there for him and he’s fine now. However, he added that he think the cancer is back and his PET scan is next month. 

I was internally freaking out and sent my brother a text about getting his shit together. It went like this:

“This is def the time to get serious about school so you can get on your feet. I won’t be able to support you from Japan if he dies. I don’t mean to sound harsh or intimidating, but this is the moment to force yourself to make a change.

25915,"AITA for not tipping despite wanting to?. This happened just 2 hours ago and I still feel oddly bad about it. So for context, there's this branch of a local Japanese restaurant chain near my workplace that I eat in often. Excellent service and they have all my favorites (including hot barley tea) but in this specific branch the bill and change takes ages, so instead of kicking up a fuss (obligatory ""I Have Anxiety"" warning) I just tend to ask for the bill when I'm almost done eating so I don't have to stew in annoyance and anxiety. Today, my mom dropped by for lunch with me during her errands, and long story short, she's impatient, pushy and generally not very fun once her temper gets set off, and boy do a lot of things set her off.

Now, I suggested that restaurant for reasons irrelevant to the incident, but when she was simply chatting and polishing off the last of her maki, I told her I was gonna ring for the bill. She told me not to be pushy and impatient because she's still eating. I warned her that they take a really long time to bill out, so it's better to do it now. She, again, scolds me and hissed at me to stop being rude when I tried again, so I dropped the topic.


Finally, after she's finished her food, she calls for the bill. The wait takes around 10 minutes, which was honestly not as bad as usual, but sends her in a huffy tizzy in which she pestered, demanded and scolded like 3 different waitstaff and kept telling them off for taking too long. None of them were the ones who served us originally.


When the bill arrives, I bring out my wallet to tip, as was customary, when she starts hissing at me that they ""didn't deserve it"" and were ""lazy when they could just push one button and be done with it"" and that I'm ""wasting money on poor service."" She even made a move to smack my hand, too. So I put my wallet back in my bag.


Now, she turns her back, and I easily could have just pushed some bills under the tray, but again, I have anxiety and my mom's already fuming, so I decided not to risk it. Then she went to the bathroom and I still decided not to risk it. Then when we were going out, she huffed right out the door and I STILL didn't want to risk it. And when I turned back to look at the table, the waitstaff seemed to be talking about something and seemed to be gesturing at the table.

24950,"AITA For Asking My Mum To Not Sing So Loud?. So before I begin, some context. My Mum has recently gotten a new set of headphones  and, as a result, has started listening to music non-stop. A side effect of this is that she will sing along frequently. She cannot sing. She used to sometimes sing, but it wasn't as loud or as frequent. In addition, loud noises, especially those that are high-pitched, can have a really negative effect on me. This is worse when I'm stressed or upset, to the point where I will sometimes end up curled up on the floor, rocking back and forth and covering my ears. One of my Mum's favourite songs to sing along to is Bohemian Rhapsody. 

&#x200B;

So very recently I asked her to sing a little quieter, as I could hear it in my room and it's a little annoying (I didn't phrase it like that). She completly understandably got upset, apologised and called herself 'evil'. This is something she does frequently and I'm not sure whether it's to make me feel guilty or if she genuinely thinks that. However I assumed she was trying to make me feel guilty and snapped at her. She told me that I needed to get my anxiety under control and left, calling that she was originally going to sing down the stairs but now wasn't going to. 

&#x200B;

In addition, I will sometimes close my door so I can't hear the singing. She doesn't like this and will tell me to leave it open so she can feel 'connected' to me. I would also like to mention that when she came into this room for the conversation, not only was she wearing headphones, but her music was loud enough that she couldn't hear me and had to pull one out.

&#x200B;

It is completely fair for her to be able to sing in her house, I only want her to sign a little softer. She usually sings when she is happy, so she can't help herself sometimes and our house is designed in such a way that noise travels through the house quite easily.

Me and my other friend are both really annoyed at this and my other friend has actually tried confronting her, but she defended her actions saying that ""she's autistic"" (bullshit - I have plenty of autistic friends and none of them do this) and when he stated ""moving peoples stuff like that is why people don't like you"" she said she didn't care and just continued to do it.

Yesterday, at lunch break I was reading a post on Reddit (it was a really long paragraph post on r/entitledparents I think) and I had my phone set down on the table, then out of nowhere she just grabs it and yeets it to the other side of the table. Now this made me lose my shit. I picked my phone up, put my coat on and walked out, and went to spend the rest of my lunch break elsewhere. She had imo gone too far.

I spoke to my friend later who could understand why I was annoyed and said he would speak to her and ask her not to do it anymore. He did this today, she lost her shit and has now started refusing to hang around us. I feel quite guilty now, so Reddit, AITA?. Am I the asshole?","NTA

She seems to get a kick out of purposely annoying people, and usually with those types of people you either don't react, or force them away. It sounds like she has a bit of growing up to do as well.",0,0,0,0,1
118,"AITA for letting my boyfriend's dad change my car battery?. Last month my car battery died and wouldn't even charge. I told my mom as I'm 17, don't have a job, and it's kinda her responsibility right now. Everytime I asked she either didn't answer or kept switching up what her plan was. My mom also has a pattern of not taking care of things until it impacts her daily life. I need the car to get to school and have already missed 2 days due to not having it, something needed to be done. 

My boyfriend's dad, Larry, offered and I accepted as I needed help and he knows about cars. He jumpstarted it, took it to his house, and checks the battery with a little tool thing (idk, it just measured the level of power the battery was giving off I think) and concluded that it was the battery. He took it out as we we're still confused as to why it wasn't charging and low and behold, the battery is leaking badly. 

The battery is already out and Larry offers to get me a new battery since I need the car for school. I accept because as far as I know, my mom has no real intention of doing anything. I text her to 

She lectured me on how I was being too independent and overstepping boundaries. All I did was get my car battery changed. I especially saved her $100 and an hour of her time.

3045,"WIBTA if I followed my neighbor on Twitch?. This is more of a lighter post than some of the others, but I just had a weird interaction with my next door neighbor and I need to know if I'd be a creep or otherwise leaning into an awkward situation at the expense of another person's comfort.

My apartment complex just got new dryers that don't have timers on them, so to be sure that I didn't leave a finished load of laundry longer than necessary I went down early to wait for it to finish. As I'm waiting, my next door neighbor, with whom I've never interacted before, came in to get her laundry from another dryer. The laundry room is directly below her apartment, and I had a belt in the dryer, so I apologized if she could hear it clanging around from her apartment. She said she couldn't hear it, and then apologized for any noise she makes while Twitch streaming, which I never hear anyways.

I saw this as a conversational opportunity to find out what sort of games she streams and politely ask if she'd be willing to share her username, which she did. Sounds fine, right? Here's the thing, though: while she was picking up her clothes, she informed me that she had to clean all of her clothes, and in fact she was dressed in just a night gown. I think she may have found the situation uncomfortable and only told me her Twitch username out of politeness, but I kind of want to be a friendly neighbor and genuinely support her channel, especially since women tend to be harassed on Twitch. I'm happily taken and have zero desire to be anything other than a good neighbor to this girl.

This actually doesn't technically mean you're an asshole. Because, why would following someone on twitch be an asshole move?

39562,"AITA for not wanting my friend to DM in D&D. Hi guys, this is my first post so apologies in advance for any formatting issues. 

To give this some context. We have recently got a group of us together to do D&D. I organised this so I DM'd and recently ran and completed lost mines of phandelvor (LmoP) the starter campaign which ran a few months. After we agreed I would run storm kings thunder (SKT) then Rise of Tiamat. 

The issue is another player in the group and long time friend is also mad into D&D and likes to DM. He never said anything when we set the timeline out but after asked privately if he could run a different campaign. Waterdeep dragon heist. A very different style of campaign. Maybe once a month. To give me a break from DMing and let him do it. 

I had no issue with this so said as long as it doesnt disrupt my campaign and it's done on I do 4 sessions he does 1 split so the focus is mine then I have no problem with that and we brought it to the group and they agreed. 

So here is the problem. Now he tentatively posted in the group chat saying how should we split the sessions up. Bearing in mind we have had this conversation already. He asked if I would be ok with a 2/2 or a 3/2 mine to his ratio would be ok and I straight up said no. We agreed 4/1. So he then calls me up and again asks how do we want to split it and would I be ok letting him continue with his campaign if it ends in an awkward place where it makes sense to keep going next week. 

So I said no thats not ok. Part of being a DM is managing things so that doesnt happen. I get in this random shit happens where you just cant plan it but if you think it's going to lead somewhere where you will want to continue end the session early so we can pick up the session in a month time.  Likewise I will use my 4 sessions to make sure we leave on cliff hangers that can be picked up again after his.

I was attending school, and she stayed home to job search. What ended up happening was I was covering her half of the rent and doing most of the chores while she played video games all day.
 Her computer broke, so I was letting her use mine when I wasn't using it. Recently it got to the point where she was constantly on it and I was on it for maybe an hour a week. I also set her rules and was finding her breaking them (like multiple save files for 1 game when I told her the memory is low) and finding her on my computer without my permission. I had enough and put a password on it, so she can only play on it when I let her. That started having her ask to use it everytime she saw my face even if I had just woken up. She hasn't been on it in about a month as I've started a new job, and am staying with family to be closer to it. 
She is visiting and asked to play on it and I said no. Our cousin (16m) asked if he could play minecraft and I let him. He even knows my password because I can trust him.

This happened a couple of days ago at a small gathering we were having as a friend group. Obviously everyone was drinking and it was a general ""let's all get really drunk"" event.

It was a fairly average night. Lots of conversation, plenty of banter and everything was going quite well.
To add a bit of context there was someone attending who I have a crush on. I've not hidden this fact and a few of my friends that were attending knew. I'm fairly sure this person has a crush on one of my friends so that's a bit of a bummer but no big deal.

It was reaching around midnight when I openly said to my friend ""I believe X fancies Y and not me. Think I should just leave it?""

Their response was ""Of course X fancies Y and not you. They're much better looking and a lot more fun."" at the time it came across as a statement that wasn't even verging on a joke and really ruined my night. I immediately grabbed my stuff and just left as I couldn't be in the same room as them.

31647,"AITA for not wanting to do ""Natural Family Planning"". My Catholic wife (married civilly 8 months ago and soon to be married in the church for her peace of mind) seems to really want to do Natural Family Planning. She has always been on birth control since I've known her but recently a relatively young friend of her passed away from a brain aneurysm, of which apparently studies have shown that long-term birth control use could increase the likelihood. I am not Catholic. I grew up Methodist but now am agnostic at best. I also hold many grudges against the Catholic church for both legitimate and stupid reasons.

Anyway in order to get married in the church you have to go through several steps including 4-7 private meetings with the Priest, precanna, and a class on Natural Family Planning. I can't stand the idea of NFP. I have gone to all of these things because I love her and it means a lot to her. I've gritted my teeth and even put a smile on through the whole process. All of a sudden she is very serious about wanting to do NFP, to which I thought I was being reasonable in saying I totally understand if you don't want to be on birth control but I would want to use condoms if you get off it. She found this very offensive as it would leave her to do all the ""work"" in terms of her schedule, which is true, although most would be done by her even if I were involved. In the class they stressed the importance of doing the work together and understanding her cycle which quite honestly, I would much prefer just wearing a condom. 

My thought process was I understand and will try to meet you half way about contraception especially since your health is involved, but if you misread the ""signs"" that is a lifelong obligation. We want kid/s but I want child/children when we both agree to it.

30978,"AITA for cooking dinner on Sundays?. Lots of background for what is not a big deal.  Just want to know if I'm not being objective. 

&#x200B;

My husband and I both work corporate jobs, but I work much longer hours than him.  He's usually home by about 5:30pm during the week.  I usually get home at around 8pm. We don't have kids and basically try to share household jobs about 50/50.  Nobody has set jobs, we just kind of vibe it and haven't had many issues.   We do try to split the cooking, and whoever doesn't cook cleans up afterwards.  However, I reeeeeally hate doing the cooking on week nights.  When I get home from a stressful day of work at 8pm at night, I want to sit and unwind a bit. The last thing I want to do is start cooking, but I have to start cooking straight away otherwise we have to eat super late.

&#x200B;

So it usually ends up being the case that my husband cooks 3 nights during the week and I cook one night (and we have take away or just scrambled eggs and toast on Friday ), because I whinge a bit about how tired I am and can't be bothered cooking.  My husband gets a bit annoyed about having to do more of the cooking, but generally does it albeit a bit begrudgingly.

&#x200B;

I actually quite like cooking, and often do a lot of cooking on the weekends when I can take my time and enjoy the process.  In fact I find it therapeutic.  Often I'll spend hours on Sunday cooking soups and stuff to take as lunches to work.  I just really can't be bothered doing it after work during the week.

&#x200B;

So - as a solution to my husband being (only moderately) annoyed about doing more cooking during the week, I want to cook two dinners worth of food on Sunday.  We can then heat those dinners up on Monday and Tuesday, and then he cooks dinner on Wednesday and Thursday and we are golden.   He doesn't like this idea because he thinks re-heated food doesn't taste as good.  My view is that if he doesn't want to have to do extra cooking, this is a great solution.  His view is that he shouldn't have to sacrifice eating better tasting food because I can't be bothered cooking?

So...AITA?. Am I the asshole?","NAH because I think you’ll just have to prove to him reheated food tastes good. I guess some people aren’t used to it, but you can show him!

N and his wife (my mom, G) are renting out a very nice house in Maine (from a friend) for a week's vacation in July.  They invited my sister (J) and her husband (B) and their two small children.  N and G are bringing their exceptionally well behaved dog, Mook (corgi mix, this dog is seriously more well behaved than most adults), because he is like another child to them and causes no issues at all.

&#x200B;

J and B (both late 30's) asked if they could bring their two dogs (Kodak, a brussels griffon and Steve, a maltese) to the vacation home.  These dogs are not as well behaved as Mook.  N & G checked with the property owner and got the go-ahead to have 3 dogs in the home for the weeklong rental (and communicated this to J)

&#x200B;

Kodak has some health issues (kidney stones) and has recently started having a lot of accidents around the house.  He also takes it upon himself to be as disruptive as possible at all times, and requires constant attention to ensure that he is not eating anything outside of his highly specialized diet.  Given this information, and the fact that N & G really didn't think enough about it before getting and communicating the fact that it was OK for Kodak and Steve to come, N & G want to renege on allowing the two dogs on vacation.

Our boss is relatively new, she’s a manager that looks over many sites. One of our employees have been MIA due to her dad having cancer and her elderly parents living in Florida. 

Our other employee got into a car accident and I agreed to take on more shifts after class but lately I’ve been feeling used. I don’t mind the extra money but this third trimester has been pretty awful. I’m already anemic and the baby makes it worse. I almost passed out dealing with a baby twice.

I’m getting really impatient with my boss not hiring someone at this point and letting the MIA employee go. She’s clearly not in this state, not coming back anytime soon and i really want my time off to spend with my baby and work on myself. Now, my boss wants me to make myself available anytime in case our one other employee can’t go in. 

Our conversation yesterday:

Me “No. We agreed that I could have the summer off”

Her “Well I don’t have anyone else”

Me “I already agreed to help train someone new before I leave for maternity leave.”

Her “I don’t think you understand how hard it is fire someone and hire someone new”

Me “I understand I can’t help you with the hiring process but I’m totally willing to help train that person so they can replace me and MIA employee. I really like the time off since I’ll be a first time mom and the dad will continue working after taking two weeks off”

Her “You’re not being a reliable employee right now. I’m gonna need you here until I can find someone”

Me (clearly upset at this point) “ok I’m going to finish screening these babies”

We haven’t talked since and I didn’t get called in for being rude but maybe I’ve been too forward and not as understanding. Pregnancy has made me irritable lately. So AITA?. Am I the asshole?","NTA.

My friend wanted to leave a microwave on campus and first Sara, then I would have it.

 The day that I was supposed to collect it from Sara arrived and at about 5, when I got out of work, I asked her when I could come pick it up. She said that there was no need because she had a car and could drop it off at 8. I waited around until then, but she didn't arrive. I texted her at 8:30 and she said packing was taking her longer than she expected but that she could bring it over in about an hour. I texted her again at 9:30. She got back to me at 10 and said that she would actually not be able to drop it off and that I needed to pick it up. I'm a small woman and it isn't especially safe for me to walk alone after dark, so I agreed to pick it up in the morning.

59948,"AITA for Thinking My Ex is Being Unfair about Child Support. My ex and I have a young child together and get along very well. Our son's time is split about 55% with her, 45% with me. We also are pretty understanding with each other and always try to accommodate the other's schedule and last minute things that come up whenever we can.

The one topic that always turns into an argument is child support. We were never married and we agreed she wouldn't work when pregnant and for the first three years of our son's life. I'm lucky enough to have a job that pays me very well (about $150k/yr) and my income comfortably allowed her stay home from work even living in a large city. Because she hadn't worked in so long, I paid her spousal support (plus some child support) throughout this year since we split despite us having never been married because I thought it was fair. Now we disagree on how to calculate child support with spousal support ending.

My job pays well, but I work a lot and it's high stress. I chose my career because I wanted to be able to provide plenty of opportunities for my family, but if money wasn't a consideration I would be doing something else. Now that my ex needs to work, she chose a job that is in-line with her passion but pays very little (less than $20k/yr). She told me that she turned down jobs that paid 4-to-5 times more and chose the low-paying passion job because ""those other jobs wouldn't make me happy."" Now we're trying to figure out an arrangement for child support without getting lawyers involved.

We can follow the law and calculate it solely on income. However, I think it's unfair of her to make me pay more in child support so she can do the low-paying job she loves when she had the opportunity to take a job earning much much more. So I suggested we settle on some lesser number because it would've been lesser had she taken the higher paying job. That caused an argument and I was told I had no right to dictate what job she chose and that being happy at work would make her a better parent (which makes sense). So I suggested I might consider a lower-paying career for the same reason. She accused me of making threats and asked to end the conversation saying she should probably get a lawyer.

So, AITA here for thinking I'm being treated unfairly? I realize I'm lucky to be have a good job getting paid what I am and in normal circumstances I would probably be fine paying more than obligated in child support. But I feel like I'm being taken advantage of here, and I could really use some outside views to help me figure out if ITA in this situation. Thanks.

Edit: For clarity of gender.. Am I the asshole?","NTA, you've split up and if she wants to choose a low paying career that's on her.

38765,"UPDATE: WIBTA if I wore soccer cleats that no one else could afford to a casual soccer event?. # Original:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/brq6j7/wibta\_if\_i\_wore\_soccer\_cleats\_that\_no\_one\_else/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/brq6j7/wibta_if_i_wore_soccer_cleats_that_no_one_else/) 

The general consensus was that since I was asking if I could wear the cleats for fun, that I was being the asshole.... 

But there was a healthy contingent of ""wear them anyways for safety, don't take the risk, don't go try-hard mode"". 

The safety crowd had a compelling point, and I resolved to try to play safely and casually in the cleats.

# So what happened?

Several hours prior to the match, one among the very low income players saw my cleats and remarked that he wished he had cleats too saying: ""do you have some for me too?"" 

*groan*

So I went from feeling comfortable with my safety decision, to feeling uncertain again.  

But I kept to the plan.

I wore them, but worked really hard to make it a community feeling event. I made sure everyone knew everyone's name on my team, I did lots of passing, lots of encouragement to both teams, and I refrained from using the cleats aggressively. 

What this meant was when a guy without cleats made a move on me, I didn't spring instantly back in front of him, but accelerated at a rate that I could have done with normal street shoes.  this allowed him the second he needed to get a killer cross and for one of his teammates to get the game winning goal (2-1).  

So I feel that i PLAYED rather responsibly, both safely, and in a non-asshole manner since I didn't leverage the most powerful aspect of the cleats to my advantage.  

But that wearing the cleats was possibly still a mistake since I knew going into it that one of the players was envious.

I was always a huge fan of comic books...I've read thousands of them, and still do. But unlike before, I don't LOOK like someone who is stereotypically assumed to read a lot of graphic novels.

Whereas before, I was overweight, unkempt and wore Superman T-Shirts, now I looked completely different. People usually assume other things about me now.

So my flatmate (19M) sort of fits the stereotype and he is a member of the society. He also self proclaimed ""nerd"" (term he uses). I asked him whether I could come along with him and he agreed. 

So when I arrived, I noticed I was getting weird looks from others, as if I ""shouldn't be there"". Well the society was having a debate on who would win between Batman vs Superman, and the society split into two groups. Those who thought Batman would win went into one group, and those who thought otherwise went into another.

Right off the bat, I noticed that a lot of people (on both sides) didn't really seem to know what they were talking about. They were citing non-canon comics, elseworlds stories and using out of context scans. I even pointed out the exact issue numbers and context because I had read the comics they were trying to rely on. I even cited quotes from the writers of those comics which further clarified it (also note...I was team Superman).

I got some dirty looks, but what I was saying was true. These people didn't seem to even understand basic multiverse theory, which is a pretty easy thing to grasp in comics. Or if they did understand it, they were being disiningeous and trying to pass off certain comics as canon for the mainstream continuinity. 

Afterward my flatmate and some others went for drinks so I joined them. One of the guys, we'll call Steve, was a bit hostile to me, saying that he thinks I googled this stuff beforehand.

I don’t have a problem at all that they named their daughter Evelynn, after all, Grammy Eve was their grandmother too. My question is this, would we be the buttholes if we went ahead and named our daughter Evelynn too? 

Other than some family events being a little confusing, I can’t really see any issue with it, especially since we’re not super close, but I would hate to break some huge unknown social faux-pas. And we did have the name picked out first, even if their kiddo was born before ours.

45689,"AITA for being petty toward my roommate when he doesn't pull his weight?. My roommate moved in about 4 months ago. He had just moved from another country and didn't have any furniture, so when he finally ordered a roll out mattress, I gave him an extra comforter I had just bought and hadn't used. He's still using it and has not bought any other furniture. 

He cooks almost every night while I cook maybe once or twice a week at most. He has not bought any pots/pans, dishes or utensils and uses all my stuff. He washes his dishes, but does not clean the kitchen counters, stove top, floor or front of the refrigerator. He has not once, to my knowledge, ever swept or mopped the kitchen or hallway since he moved in. 

We agreed that we would take turns buying shared items like paper towels and dish soap. When he moved in, I had bought a huge 12 or 18 pack of paper towels that just ran out. When I asked him to please buy more, he bought a small 6 pack. His girlfriend bought the last bottle of dish soap when she visited/stayed with us for 2 weeks last month. I have bought all other cleaning supplies, trash bags, tin foil, ziploc bags, etc. 

We make the same amount and pay the same in rent. I pay for cable, WiFi and all utilities because my room is slightly larger. He makes a lot of cheap food like ramen, doesn't have a car and rarely goes out, so I can't see what he would be spending on that might make it a money problem.

In my opinion, it would be ridiculous for there to be two sets of everything in the kitchen just because you cook less frequently.

He sounds like material things are not that important to him— you seem very different from each other. Honestly, he probably hasn’t given another thought to the comforter.

My suggestion would be to create a shared Google Doc with all of the chores and items you want addressed if you’re uncomfortable having a conversation.

I (15M) am a part of an online friend group and have been for around two or three years, with a few of my buddies that live around me, and others that are scattered across the country. The online people had met with us over Xbox and it pretty much went on from there. G (14F) is a generally timid person, but has been made very uncomfortable by Q (19M) on numerous occasions. J (19M) lives near Q and they are very good friends.

Q was always a sketchy guy. The fact that he talks to us at all is strange considering his age, but that is the least of his issues. Q was always especially affectionate and kind whenever G was around, and it was just creepy, but we had not realized it before when we were younger. When G was 12 years old and Q was 17, Q had even asked her if “she trusted him with her nudes” and had mentioned that he “trusted her with his”. G was very uncomfortable and had obviously answered no. She only informed me and one other of my buddies of this a few months ago, and we have been much colder with Q since then.

Q has also talked to us a lot about his adult issues and even his sex life, and even if we told him to stop, he would simply talk about it another day. He is simply not welcome with us anymore. However, J is a different guy. He is far kinder, and cares about pretty much everyone in our group equally. It is still a little strange because he is an adult too, but he isn’t a predator, I hope. He is very, very depressed and struggles with it every day. We fear that if we were to kick Q out of all of our lives, it would hurt him. Q is pretty much his only real friend.

She says to me: ""u/Morangatang , can you go downstairs and get the tap from the garage?""  It's a crystal-looking bucket with a spigot on it, very common for sangria, and it was attached to a stand to elevate it (the stand happened to be made out of the same clear plastic that the tank was).  

Now I had never inspected this thing too close, because it always just sat on a shelf, and also I don't drink.  I look at it and think it's just one piece, as both the tank and the stand are made of the same lightweight plastic, so I pick it up by the sides without much thought.  As I carry it in to the kitchen I bring it up to set it on the table when the bottom just slides right out from under it and hits the ground, resulting in it forming a big crack in the plastic.

My mother is suddenly livid, yelling at me that I should've held it from the bottom, and that I ruined a really nice piece of kitchenware (really nice cheap plastic, apparently).  But I certainly didn't do this on purpose; I was holding it by the sides because it was lightweight and I had to set it on the table, and up until that point I had no clue that the thing was even two separate pieces, and she didn't tell me at all that it *was* two pieces.

I checked in with no issues, got to my room and after setting my stuff down I hear someone trying to slide their card in my door. I kind of pause to see if it’s actually my door or my neighbors. By the time I get to the peephole they’re gone, I figure someone was at the wrong room, no biggie. 
So I’m running a temp and take all my clothes off 5 minutes later to soak in the bath. Imagine my surprise when I hear someone try their card again- and it works! Yep. This random man is now standing in my hotel room like a deer in headlights and I’m so conveniently in my bra and underwear.

I call the front desk to let them know too and they were super casual about it, “whoops double booked that room sorry about that!” 
And while I get it, mistakes happen, now I’m paranoid it’ll happen again and can’t sleep. 
So then I go to the vending machine for water (wrapped in a blanket looking like hell) and when I get back- locked out. I was slightly afraid of that hoping they didn’t deactivate his keys and mine to be safe, and hoping if they did they would let me know. 
So off I went to the front desk, where no one was there. I rang the bell and waited for 25 minutes (not long but when you’re sick and just want to curl up in bed, feels like forever) 
The guy activated my card quickly (didn’t ask my name or anything just the room number which added to my paranoia) and I was headed back to my room. 

So I recognize I’m probably just extra crabby because I’m sick, so I’m probably being an asshole.

So I'm 16 years old, I grew up with my mom telling me my dad was working in another country and he was very busy so we couldn't visit him. I used to write him letters, send drawings, postcards and so on. I got letters and presents from him on my birthday and Christmas.

When I was 9 a mean cousin told me that my dad was in prison and I was the daughter of a criminal. I ran to my mother and he confirmed it, which shattered my world (on top of being bullied by my cousins). I stopped sending letters and threw away the letters and presents I got from him.  

A couple of years later I looked him up and learned that he was imprisoned for a robbery gone wrong, he and an accomplice were robbing a store, one of the patrons tried running away and they shot him in the back. They were lucky he didn't die, but still were given a hefty prison sentence. I realized that he had been in prison for longer than I had existed, so I went to my mom and she confirmed that I was conceived during a conjugal visit, which made things even worse for me.  

My mom has been in contact with him the whole time, and happily announced that he's due to be released in a couple months, and as her husband, he's going to come and live with us.  
I told her that I don't want to have anything to do with this man, I don't want to talk to him, interact with him in anyway or even look at him, I've never even talked to him in person, nor has he ever contributed to my life in any way, so I consider him a stranger, and a criminal one at that.  
My mom said tough luck, I'm living in her house rent free, still a minor and I have no say in all of this. So I asked around and I found an aunt willing to take me in and pay for my sustenance, just so I don't have to be near this guy.  

Now my mom is saying I'm an asshole for not giving him a chance, but I don't feel like I have to, he's a criminal, not a petty one but he tried to kill someone, and besides I was lied to for several years and only learned the truth because of someone else.

I’m an actor who’s been lucky enough to work in a lot of cool and exciting places, but I crash at my parents’ house when I’m not away for a contract. Both of my parents are somewhat hard-of-hearing so they blast the TV, which happens to share a wall with my bedroom. This wouldn’t be too much of a problem if it wasn’t for the TV they prefer to watch - Conservative talk shows.  
I’m gay (out for 3 years) and my parents are relatively conservative Christians. I get my news from certain sources, my parents get it from others - I understand that. Where I feel this crosses into asshole territory is that the commentators on 700 Club, Fox News, CBN, etc. are not shy showing contempt for people like me, and I’m being forced to listen to it for hours every day. It’s the first thing my Mom puts on in the morning, and it’s the last thing Dad hears as he falls asleep on the couch. As such, I’m constantly hearing something that upsets me.  


I've tried talking to my parents about how the commentators make me feel but I was dismissed as being “too sensitive” because they’ve ""never heard anti-gay things” on the shows. I’ve tried asking them to turn it down, but the volume quickly gets turned back up. I’ve tried watching the shows with my parents and opening up a debate, but that’s just caused political fights.

(Keep in mind that I have talked about this to her before when I was feeling overwhelmed, but it was mostly through text messages. But I understand if she may feel fed up by it.)

I told her that since I am unsure what I really want to do for my life, I've decided to move at the end of the year and figure everything out. Jessie then proceeded to tell me that honestly she thinks I'm too ""weak"", and I should continue to stay in the city because it has better opportunities.

I feel so disrespected. They disrespected my time and my energy after I warned them twice.

So I’m not speaking to either of them and one other friend who was in on it, but the rest of our group is saying I’m overreacting. In my opinion, none of them was forced into an awkward and emotionally taxing situation like I was.

1348,"AITA for being annoyed that my roommate never offers me food?. First, some context. I live with two roommates and one of them loves to cook and bake, just like I do. There's rarely a time when one of us isn't in the kitchen making something. We often talk with each other about the recipes we want to try, what were doing differently that day, etc. We don't cook together much because we both are kind of control freaks when it comes to our food and want to make everything our way. I really enjoy the social aspect of food, so usually once or twice a week I'll make something to share with my roommates. I like seeing their reactions and it makes me feel good since we're all in college and having someone else making your food is a pretty big luxury. I also like to get feedback from my roommates on what I could do differently, especially the other cook because he has a great pallete and always has some very insightful advice 

My roommate does not seem to share this sentiment. We have lived together for 1 1/2 years now and he has never offered me a single thing he has made. This seems kind of absurd to me considering he will frequently make huge amounts of food that he can't even finish before it goes bad. I know he has no obligation to offer me anything, but I think it's kind of inconsiderate of him to spend a morning telling me all about a recipe he's gonna try and what he's gonna do to make it and not ever think to offer me some. I think some of it might just be that I really respect his tastes and feedback and i just feel a little insulted that he doesn't see me in the same way. What do you think Reddit? .

80935,"AITA for not wanting to shovel our neighbours driveway?. My wife and I live in Canada. I always shovel the snow when there’s a big snowfall. It’s been like that for the whole time we’ve been together. I’ll be honest it does bother me a bit that she never even offers to help but I’ve never complained. She hates the cold and apparently she’s never shoveled the snow before because her dad or little brother always shoveled the snow growing up. 

Her friend, who lives down the street from us just had a baby. Her husband travels a lot for work and took 2 weeks off of work after the baby but is now back to work again. My wife is always trying to help her and brings her food often and offers to baby sit her other daughter occasionally. 

So today there was a huge snow storm. I had work until 2:00 today and as soon as I got back I went to shovel the snow (my wife doesn’t work on Saturday’s)  It took me awhile but when I finished and came inside my wife immediately said I should help shovel her friends snow as well since her husband isn’t around. 

I was pretty annoyed and said no since I was tired and cold. She seemed surprised I said no and said that it was the right thing to do and said “I shouldn’t be lazy” and she’ll make me some hit chocolate and cookies. I finally snapped and said if she wanted me to do it do much she should do it herself instead of just sitting on her ass being ungrateful and expecting me to do it. I admit that I raised my voice a bit but I was annoyed and tired. 

My wife look surprised at my outburst and said I was being a jerk. She has been given me the silent trip since. 

Around 2 hours later I eventually went to her friends house to shovel the snow  but the silent treatment hasn’t stopped. 

AITA here?. Am I the asshole?","If she’s not shoveled snow before she may have no idea what a big, hard task that can be.  This would be a good time for her to learn since her idea of helping the new mom is very kind.

It was about 7pm and she was done looking for cars and then she text me and says ""I'm test driving a car home with the dealer lol!"" something like that. I told her that I thought that was weird. She said it wasn't weird and that it happened naturally. She told me basically she looked at another car and said she thinks it's nice and the dealer asked her if she wanted to drive it. She replied ""Only if I can drive it home!"" and he said ""Sure, we can drop you off"". Then she drove the car home.

I told her I felt that was weird and dangerous and that I think she should be more careful next time. I also told her somethings not a joke if you want it to happen.

2352,"AITA for not wanting to be friends with people who constantly talk about their depression?. Disclaimer: Ive experienced depression, I was in a situation which most people I know haven't had to deal with, that caused me a great deal of hopelessness and stress at home. So I can empathesize strongly with people who have issues like I did, and because of this I tend to take care of people, to want to help them as much as I can, to give advice, to go out of my way. And I'm starting to feel like it's not my problem anymore. 

I'm a kind person and I know this. However I feel like a dick for wanting to distance myself. I am generally the person who friends vent to which is good. But I also seem to attract problematic people who only vent and are literally doing nothing to change their situations except complaining. 

For example, I stopped talking to this girl because every day we'd text and she would discuss how depressed she is about her ex, how no one wants her, how shes not good at anything, and how that day she was going to kill herself. I'd talk her off the ledge every day. 

Another guy(who I really like as a person) wont stop talking about his ex either, who wants no contact with him and who HE broke up with 3 months ago. Says shes so perfect, shes basically a goddess and he feels like a scummy idiot, talks about her like she is a saint. I dont just talk, I make offers, I'll send memes or play games with you or hang out, I dont give unsolicited advice to anybody, I share my own stories. He has me as his friend but always says he's so alone, has nobody. 

It feels like to people who are that depressed there is absolutely nothing you can say or do and I would rather stay away if I cant help at least with my friendship as it will just cause me stress and make me feel bad for them.

He met my friends a few months ago, and except for one of them, let's call her Alex (F25), none of them are particularly interested in IT/tech/games/etc. He did try to talk with them, but was more on the quiet side.This changed when he started talking to Alex once she asked about his hobbies.  From that moment on, we had two separate conversations; Alex and Jack talked about their projects and whatever else, and the rest of us about other things. Since then, whenever we hang out they immediately start talking to each other, while they are more quiet when it's only one of them.

Unfortunately I’m unable to keep anything else down but the downside is I’m constantly running to the restroom especially because normally I’m bad for staying hydrated so it’s taken some time to get used to. 

I was in a large home furniture store and they had a little area where you could grab some food and places to sit. There were two huge doors, one saying customer restrooms and another saying staff restrooms. 

I had sat down to drink some water and rest for a little, because I get very dizzy if I don’t take frequent rest spots, and then I really needed to pee. I went to the customer restrooms and they were occupied. I waited and waited for a solid 5 mins but I was getting progressively more desperate so I asked if I could use the staff restroom. Thankfully the manager on duty let me. When I exited there was a store employee leaving the customer restroom and she gave me the filthiest look and said verbatim ‘can’t you read that giant sign?

I was in communication with her that night and could tell from her texts that she was noticeably drunk and asked if she wanted me to pick her up sometime. She said yes and gave me a time. In the intervening time, she started telling me that ""she was probably gonna be fine if she just sobered up for like 15 more min or something"", which was pretty obviously not true/not a good idea. So just as I am leaving to pick her up, she calls me and tells me that she's going to be fine and if not, she can just find a ride. I was frustrated with her bc I did not feel like she was being responsible and I was already on my way, so I told her I was already on my way and I was still coming.

Him and myself split amicably and always remained in contact. Nothing romantic or sexual ever happened between us since we split. Matt has made mistakes over the past few years and now the building is being foreclosed. Which is where myself and two of his other close friends will now step in and buy out the debt, stopping the foreclosure, in exchange for each 1/12 ownership of the building, which equals exactly one appartment. 

The legal part is being handled by a notary and is not of concern here. The debt is 150k, each of us three people will foot one third. The building, if sold in a proper way, should go for somewhere between 800 and 900k. The plan is to bail out Matt and his building, and then we try to sell the building in a timely manner. 

Dominic, my current boyfriend of a year and a half, will have a huge issue with this. I already know that. He always disapproved of me staying in touch with Matt (who is not my most recent ex, and the only ex who I still talk to). I never budged to cut contact because there is nothing at all going on that my boyfriend should worry about. But he will end things with me if I told him I put 50k into that property. 

For me I see it as a win win situation. Matt doesn't want to let the property go for in worst case half of what it's worth. I see it as a great investment. The money would come entirely out of my savings account, which Dominic has no insight into. It will not have any financial effect on our relationship.

Some background info re: struggling—I was MOH for 2 weddings (my sister and another bestie) that were 1 month apart. Just before wedding #1, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 of an aggressive cancer and started chemo immediately. I visited her biweekly for her 4 months of chemo treatment. Friend-in-question's wedding occurred in the middle of my mom's radiation treatment, and her bachelorette date was just 3 months after the last wedding. I was BEAT, slammed at work, struggling in my relationship, and overall emotionally overwhelmed/battling severe anxiety and depression.

22434,"AITA for moving in with my boyfriend?. I (25F) currently live with my sister (27F) and her husband (32M). They recently had a baby girl. I moved in with them last year; I had come home from college and broken up with my ex and my sister and BIL let me move in while I searched for a job. While I was unemployed (which was about 3 months) I got state support to help out, cleaned the house, and cooked all the meals. After I started working, I picked up household bills.

My sister is a self-professed helicopter mom. She 
knew she was going to be before she gave birth and she is. She cannot stand to be away from her baby for more than a few minutes and she refuses to let the baby cry or self-soothe. This resulted in me agreeing to pay a larger portion of the household bills so that she didn't have to go back to work for a while because the thought of leaving her child was giving her panic attacks which led to full on meltdowns. 

During the day, pretty much all she does is lay in bed or sit on the couch with the baby, watching television, and nothing gets done around the house. I will come home and there will be a sink full of dishes, the trash can will be full, nothing will be pulled out to cook for dinner, and the dog won't have been let out to use the bathroom in hours. When I was unemployed, or when I was working but earning the least out of all of us, if household chores didn't get done, I would get bitched at. I couldn't argue with this when it was my responsibility to do and if I did, I was quickly put in my place by being told that I earned the least and worked the fewest hours so the bulk of the housework was my duty. 

I have tried addressing it with her before and it's like talking to a wall; she brushes me off and tells me that I can't possibly understand how hard it is to raise a child because I'm not a mother, with an air of superiority and smugness because she's the first one of my siblings to get married and have a baby. 

My bf (28M) has offered for me to come live with him. My BIL recently got a promotion at his job and my sister has stated that he believes it'll be enough that he can support them on just his salary, even with my sister not returning to work for several months. 

I am at the end of my rope with my sister's behavior. The situation is more nuanced than this and my mental health/overall happiness is starting to take a serious dip.

For example my partner gifts to her sister both parents and a secret Santa with her extended family

I however only really give to my brother ever since I got a job as there isn’t a lot of money in my part time work.

This has worked fine and that’s how we do things but the extended family’s have always been different my partners extended family is huge and do a secret Santa they’re also very close knit meaning I don’t really get invited to much (not that I mind) it’s just how they are.

My family usually just buy gifts for the nieces and nephews (my cousins) and not really anything except when my aunts and uncles might splash out for my grandma. The difference is I come under the “nieces and nephews” section and my partner usually does too many we get joint gifts (2 movie tickets) or smaller seperate items from my family for us both.
 
THE POINT:
I have a bit extra and asked my brother and partner to chip in on a gift for my parents this year and hey both agreed.
My parents buy us all gifts each year and it’s nice to be able to give back but because of this my partner wants to give to her parents but in the 4 years I have known them I have received nothing more than a handshake from them.

35351,"AITA for seeing the joker with only some of my friends.. I recently went to go see the new joker movie with some of my college mates (highly recommend). Now I have a fairly sizable friend group in college and quite a few of us had mentioned in passing how we wanted to see that movie together, but there wasn't anything concrete like a time or place. Fast-forward to yesterday and a few of us had stayed late at campus studying, and we thought ""hey why don't we go see that new joker movie"", which we did. When the rest of my friends heard about it they were either indifferent or jokingly mad because :

A) we hadn't really planned anything.

B)those friends were most likely gonna go see it with other people anyway (this is a friend group not a clique).

C)those friends were with us that night and declined to go see the movie.

Pretty much all of them weren't bothered at all, except for one guy who was super pissed, and felt really abandoned and betrayed. This was quite ironic as that same friend had basically tricked 90% of the group into believing he was travelling to another college abroad, and so he never hung out with us the entire summer, and rarely replied to messages or calls. even-though we had promised each other we wouldn't cut ties in the summer. All of this was in the spirit of ""memeing on us"", as he described it at the start of this year. We're a pretty laid back group so we laughed it off and would bring it up every once in a while to goof on him. (no I don't know why we were so lax about it in hindsight) 

When I brought this up on our whats app group he kicked me out. I continued our argument on a private chat and it was him basically defending his actions because he intended it as a meme, while we apparently intended  to watch the movie to be assholes. I even told him that I want to go watch the movie again and nothing is stopping us from going to see it with him, but he dismissed that. None of our other friends think we're assholes but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a bit of guilt at all this. 

TL;DR went to go see joker with some of my friends and one of the ones who we didn't take got mad, despite him having ghosted us for an entire summer.

I’m white, and she’s Hispanic. I mention this because that seems to be a major problem with some of her family. From the first time I went to her house, her immediate family was either standoffish or outright hostile (except her brother and grandma). Things haven’t changed over two years, they’ve really only gotten worse. I won’t go into details but it’s pretty bad stuff sometimes, and it even got physical at one point, to the point where her uncle had to pick her older sister up and carry her to another room and bar her in there until she calmed down (also we’re all 22-27 so that was pretty pathetic to have to see). Most recently, we took a trip to Colorado together for our anniversary. She has family up there and they’re very traditional and to keep things on the up and up, we stayed with her aunts family in separate bedrooms. We had a good time until the last day, where I overheard her aunt encouraging her to break up with me (and also drop out of college?) while my gf just told her she didn’t really want to. It was an awkward goodbye with the aunt after that, but we left and before leaving town, we stopped by her grandparents to be respectful. We were then treated to a lecture by her grandpa about how he doesn’t approve of us, if I really loved her I would marry her and get a job (I’m a CS major at a university so not a bum or anything) instead of dragging her all over the country. He said over and over that he doesn’t approve of us. After this latest incident, I’m pretty done with her family. I had tried to be polite and respectful before, and always tried to keep in mind that maybe they haven’t received great treatment at the hands of other white people, but honestly it’s just ridiculous now. It’s her family and her wedding, but it’s my wedding too, and I don’t want anyone there that only sees me as my skin color and that regularly advises my girlfriend to break up with me. Am I the a-hole for telling my girlfriend I don’t want most of her family there?

Edited to clarify: I don’t plan on forbidding or guilting her, that’s not really the kind of relationship we have. I just want her to know that I really really don’t want them there.

The remote has died and that's when I found out my girlfriend lent the charger to our neighbor.

So, he comes to ask his one cousin that might help in this situation. He offers to pay me $100 and I who needs help paying off a ticket a few months ago accepts. 

Fast forward a couple months later, I unknowingly had my license suspended because I forgot to schedule an appointment for a defender drivers class.

A couple days ago my cousin got pulled over because they ran the plates on his car that is under my name for a reason I'm not too sure(could be random or recklessly driving).

Before I start this post, I'd like to say that I have nothing against community college and students/graduates who attend(ed) them. They are a great option for many people. I might have decided on community college if things were different. But as I'll explain in this post, I prefer going right into a 4-year school in my own situation.

Since the beginning of senior year, my parents were strongly in favor of community college, because it ""makes sense"" financially. I have been accepted into my dream school. I wanted to attend that for a few reasons:

1. Our community college has very few courses that apply to my major.

2. I didn't want to give up this opportunity to go to one of the best colleges in the country. Contrary to my parents' beliefs, I cannot ""just transfer there"" after two years. They accept **30** transfer students each year.

3. Our local community college frankly sucks. The normal academic benefits of community college, like small classes and good teaching, just don't exist at that particular location.

4. Living at home for another two years would be hell. I don't want to go into detail about daily life in this house, but the next paragraph should give you some idea.

5. And money is not the only thing that matters. If paying as little as possible in the next four years were my only goal, I would not go to college at all.

We were debating this slowly over the last few weeks. My parents were frustrated. So yesterday, my mom logged into my email account and declined the offer of admission at that school. I was pissed. Her defense was just ""you're a minor, I am your parent, I have authority over you"" because I am 17 right now. I said that was bullshit, and in the argument I called her and my dad some things I regret now.

I mean she's technically right. But I think I'm mature enough to make decisions on my future. Besides that, I'm also not sure if attacking my parents personally was the right thing to do.

Some of my friends also think I'm an asshole for having an elitist attitude toward this conflict. Like I'm above community college because I was accepted into a top 10 college. I do not actually think like that - I described my real view at the beginning of this post - but if it seems that way to others then maybe I should be more careful.

More recently I've been thinking a lot about her, specifically how I treated her, and really would like to get in touch to let her know how sorry I am and make amends if I can.

The issue I have is, I'm not sure how much the apology would be for her, and how much would be for me to feel better about the past. So WIBTA if I tried to get in contact and apologise?

Edit 3: removed previous edits to keep the post concise.

I've reflected on this a lot from your comments and I think a lot of people are right and the apology would be for me and would likely not benefit her at all, and at worst bring back feelings that had been dealt with. The summary consensus is NAH for wanting to apologise, but  YTA if I tried to reach out, especially as it seems a deliberate attempt was made to block communication.. Am I the asshole?","In situations like these it’s tricky, you run the risk of again looking like an asshole because apologies like these are usually self-serving- more to make you feel better about it than to do anything for her. She’s most likely over it by now, you’re not getting her back, and there’s overall no real reason to apologize. She could be receptive and accept the apology but overall it’s not doing much for anyone but yourself. I’d say NTA but not really necessary to do so anyway",0,0,0,0,1
43128,"AITA for questioning if my fiancés son should come over when he's sick?. Okay so, my fiancé has a son that predates our relationship.
The kid wasn't planned but he still loves him to death, and since coming into the family i've grown a love for the kid aswell.
We have him over every weekend (except if something comes up) and i sacrifice alot of my free time for family time.
We take care of eachother like a family.

Things have been stressful lately.
My fiancé has been taking alot of shit at work, i'm in college and has a big test coming up, things like that.

Yesterday the kids mother said that he had thrown up during the day and had a high fever.
He caught the stomachflu.
So i assumed that he wouldn't be coming, since it's not very wise to spread the disease to begin with, but apparantly they agreed to ask him if he was up for it tomorrow.
I told him i didn't think it was very wise, since its very contagious and we can't really afford to get sick right now.
Then he started accusing me for not letting his son come over because he was sick and i didn't treat him like family (wich isn't true, he's been sick and treated here by me loads of times).
So i told him that ofcourse his son should come if he really wants to, but that i needed to spend the night somewhere else as i didn't want to risk it.
Then he started to accusing me for making him choose between me and the son and didn't want his son in our lifes etc.
Wich is so off, none of these things have ever been true.
I'm always the one who encourages him to spend time with his son.
And it's only one night because i'm sensitive to the stomachflu virus and can't afford to miss this test.
Eventually he calmed down and we decided to see what happenes tomorrow.
Ofcourse the kid wanted to come, so i went to spend the night at my dads place.
Fiancé seemed okay with it at first, but he just treats me like he couldn't give two shits about me.
It's so obvious.

It would be different if it was just a cold or something that i could handle anyways, but the stomachflu would put me out completely.

AITA for not wanting to risk getting the virus?. Am I the asshole?","YTA - if the kid is sick on dad's times, then hey guess what, dad gets to deal with a sick kid! Your parental responsibilities don't suddenly disappear when it's inconvenient to you...

First, he asked me out, and I was extremely enthusiastic about the idea of dating someone again, so I said yes even though he was completely not my type. After about three dates, we both agreed that we would just be friends, so we did, and then about a week later I found out about something. One of our mutual friends told me that he had livestreamed a rant about me using personal details like my name and where I lived. I got pissed and went to his house, where I shouted at them, and he did those callous apologies that everyone does when they get confronted. I asked him to take it down and he didn't, so then I just went home and unfollowed/unfriended him on every social media account and stopped talking to him. One of my friends told me that I was just overreacting, but I feel like it was a complete violation of my privacy.

31923,"AITA for telling the court that I saw my ex-step father as a father sometimes.. I (24F) got called into court for my mother (51F) in the custody battle of my little brother (9M). When I was up on the stand I was asked questions like who cleaned our clothes and who made us dinner, which was all my mother. Most of everything was my mother and he would sometimes help every now and then but not much. 

He did cheat on my mother and he does have a temper but so does my mother. I grew up without a father in my life. When they met I was in 5th grade and hes been in my life ever since. They would fight a lot and I would watch out for my little brother when I didn't want anything to make it worse.

My mother thinks I was too nice in saying that I thought of him as a father every now and then and that his family helped me in High school with buying me clothes. I also enjoyed going over to their house for the holidays. 

She now thinks that since I said such ""nice things"" about them it helped him get more custody of my little brother. She thinks that I should have been meaner and colder to him and his family so she would have gotten better custody. I want my little brother to have a connection to his fathers family because it's something I never had growing up. My mom has never had to deal with the father of me or my older brother..

61600,"AITA: For wanting to stop watching an acquaintances kids, when I know she’s probably not going to be able to find anyone else... It’s kind of a hard situation and one where the decision isn’t entirely mine. Back a few months ago we agreed to watch a friends kids because she suddenly lost her sitter and really had no where else to turn. I hadn’t agreed to it before hand pretty much because I knew it’d overwhelm me but when she had nowhere else to go we decided to help regardless. So it’s been about 4 months and we’ve had a lot of trouble with them and well the sitting(2 boys both school age). I should probably add that I also have 2 of my own children one of which is the same age as one of the boys I sit. They constantly fight and don’t listen very well, we’re pretty consistent with discipline but it just really is ineffective. We were willing to work with them and try to help improve on some of these issues but recently my son has been coming home from school saying they are bullying him at school and some days is completely withdrawn and won’t tell me what’s wrong. And because I know some people are going to say my son could be lying, I’ve also been warned by other parents of this behavior and told they have been asking their children to look out for my son, so I know he isn’t lying to me about it. So the other day he asked me if we could stop watching them after talking to him about what was going on at school and it broke my heart. I know their mom is in a seriously rough position and I feel awful but there’s a lot more to us wanting to quit but that straw that broke the camels back was my son asking me if we could stop. I don’t want him to feel unsafe and I’m worried it could send him the wrong message if we keep watching them. And yes this has all been addressed with the mom and things haven’t really changed and I really don’t think they will.. Am I the asshole?",NTA.

I went out to get dinner with some buddies I went to high school with. Got home at 11 by now both my mom and grandmother are well asleep.

She started to yell at me that I could burn down the house with the torch. I was furious and told her not to go through my shit and that was the end of that conversation.

44903,"AITA what I did after a friend was misgendered?. So the incident happened a few months ago but it's been weighing on me for a while now and I wanted to know if I'm an asshole for how I handled the situation.

Mostly unused alt. Keeping some unnecessary details vague.

One of the performance groups I was a part of in high school has a senior night at the end of the year where all the seniors walk across a stage in front of all our parents and the director announces our names and tells a little story or two about each of us.

The director made the mistake of misgendering my (transgender) friend ""Matt"" as he was walking across the stage in front of the entire audience. Obviously this was incredibly embarrassing for Matt and he was extremely and understandably angry about it.

My graduation party was about a week after this incident and I had invited both Matt and the director. When Matt arrived and saw the director he told me he felt very uncomfortable and that either the director needed to leave or he would leave.

Now here are the parts that I don't know if I handled correctly.

I was reluctant to do this because I really like the director and I've known them for many years so I went over, told them what was going on, asked them to leave, and they did. I feel like an asshole for kicking them out.

As I was chatting with Matt later during the party he told me he was hurt that I'd invited the director in the first place. I told him that because I believed it was a genuine accident, the director immediately corrected themselves onstage, and apologized to Matt and the group backstage immediately afterwards that he would be OK with the director being present. Matt told me that I should have asked him and that I'm an asshole for not doing so.

Although I didn't say it, I'm rather angry with Matt for making me choose between him and the director like he did.

Am I an asshole for kicking the director out?

Am I an asshole for inviting them in the first place?

Am I an asshole for assuming Matt wouldn't be bothered?

Am I an asshole for resenting Matt?

Slight . Am I the asshole?",">I told him that because I believed it was a genuine accident, the director immediately corrected themselves onstage, and apologized to Matt and the group backstage immediately afterwards 

Matt is being an asshole. Everyone makes mistakes, but it sounds like the director did everything in their power to make it right. I don't think you are an asshole for asking the director to leave, in the moment it probably felt like you didn't have a choice. In the future know that in your house, it's your rules. If Matt was so uncomfortable with the director there he should have been the one to leave.

 Now I’ve met Greg and he is really nice but I think he’s at our flat too much. I can honestly count how many times he hasn’t stayed the night rather than has on one hand.. today my sister asked me how I’d feel if Greg were to move in with us next year.*

 I asked for time to think about it but honestly I really don’t want that. My sister and Greg are both messy people and I feel like I have to tidy up after them. While my sister will help out and tidy with me sometimes there has been numerous occasions where Greg just watched me tidy up his mess, and I’m too nervous to tell him to clean it or even give me a hand.

On the one hand this is my home too and i find him tiring to be around, and I’m not like crazy about him as a person. 
But i know it would make my sister very happy to be living with him and would make the rent cheaper.

*regardless of time these two are made for each other and the whole time things doesn’t seem to be a problem. So I can’t really use that as a point for my case.
