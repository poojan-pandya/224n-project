"AITA for insisting on a refund?. I'm genuinely conflicted as I got in trouble with my PhD supervisor for this.

I was due to attend a conference which my supervisor asked me to go to. The secretariat has been a bit slack, like not informing us what our abstracts got accepted for (oral vs poster presentation) at all, although the invited speakers got the scientific programme. They then sent an email asking for meal options: halal, vegetarian or normal. I have life-threatening allergies to crab and prawn (Found this out by waking up in ICU) and emailed back my allergies. They email me back saying they did not cater to specific allergies or individual meals and if I didn't choose from either of the three options, they would put down my meal as normal. 
I was taken aback as in all my years of attending conferences, when asked a meal preference and told about my allergies, I was never told that these could not be accommodated. And they were pretty rude (I thought, but might be a language barrier) about it. And honestly, if they even replied ""We're sorry that we can't guarantee that the food will not be cross-contaminated, may we suggest the halal or vegetarian option"", I would have let it go. But being told that a choice was going to be made for you really ground my gears (that, and that they never bothered to tell me what kind of presentation I should be prepping for! The conference is November and we were supposed to be told first week of August!)
So I emailed back saying I found it astonishing that an organization of this calibre could not assure food safety, and that I would like a refund of the registration fee. This was processed promptly with a more conciliatory tone.
Now my PhD supervisor is upset because he thinks I should have just brought my own food. I could have, but it seems wrong somehow that vegetarian and halal can be catered for and not life-threatening allergies. But my PhD supervisor is insisting that he's attended international meets with no food and I should have sucked it up.

So AITA?","YTA. Why all this needless drama and attention-seeking. You should have just selected the vegetarian option and not even started the whole back and forth. What do you expect them to do, make you your own super duper special meals while they are catering for 100’s of people. In a professional establishment there’s no reason for a vegetarian (and definitely not a halal or kosher) dish to be cross-contaminated with crab and prawns. That was the obvious and sensible choice. If you felt that was still too much of a risk, then yes, you should have brought your own food. The world does not revolve around you. You were unprofessional, not them, as you’re going to have problems going to a lot of conferences and professional events if you keep this shit up.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for telling her that her boyfriend creeps me out?. *Names are fabricated to protect the innocent.*

I went to my first cosplay meet in July. On Facebook, I announced that I was going as an anime anti-hero. “Michelle” enthused that she would come as the protagonist.

On the day, I saw 30+ cosplayers and some photographers. We met and gushed about the show and our look. She shipped our characters like I. We had duo photos taken.

Then we took selfies and Pocky Game pictures. The only thing that pops now was her refusal to kiss me, which isn't too abnormal.

Later I followed her frequently updated Facebook. I crushed on her.

But I fucked up. I posted pics calling the characters lesbians, with a note that we were only actors. Turns out she has a boyfriend, and he and her parents want them taken down. I apologised for not asking her before posting. I replaced it, but it may have been too late.

I was the asshole here, but I'm unsure of the rest.

But her boyfriend “John” sent irate, transphobic drivel on his main *and* alt account, which I reported and blocked. (Like “You're a lesbian like a cat is a dog”, ±wording.) She said that he “just gets worried”, but she also said that she was bi.

5 days after, she messaged me that he doesn't like me, I shouldn't come to the next event, and she “can't control her boyfriend”, which screams “John doesn't trust me”. (She said she'd date me if not for him.)

Our relation tanked. John kept hovering within 5 m of her everywhere while wearing [this perverted T-shirt](https://nicosquared.com/products/limited-edition-ahegao-print-shirts) 4× in a row. For a guy fuming from saucy pictures, his tee shows no subtlety nor social aptitude.

Michelle also ignored me, forcing me to gaze from afar. I joked about him to my Internet friends at first, but after 4 events, I decided to tell her online, who accused me of stalking her.

She said, “I don’t understand why you are picking on me.” I wasn’t. “It should be clear that I don't want to engage with you”. It wasn’t. “You made me feel uncomfortable at the first meetup.” I saw mild awkwardness at most. “My boyfriend said you take photos of me behind my back.” He jumped to conclusions. I use my phone a lot and take pictures of my surroundings, plus I was admiring her cosplay; he forced my hand and wouldn't let me ask her for a selfie.

I told her what I annotated, and that I would've improved myself if it was sooner. I added that John always seemed possessive and that it forbade me to clarify things.

She scoffed “cosplay is a scary world” and that she was mad I dissed his shirt. I clarified again that I had no beef with her. She said that I wasn't respecting “ahegao meme culture”.

We got into a fight. The last thing she said was that I leave her alone forever.

If I could, I would have clarified that I admired her, didn't mean to upset her, and have no intent to stalk her.

AITA for all of it, or the start?","YTA. You tried to kiss her, she wasn't interested. You publicly posted that you were lesbians, she's not a lesbian, and clearly doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. You say ""Michelle also ignored me, forcing me to gaze from afar."" Nobody was *forcing you to gaze at a woman who rejected you.* And it does sound like you were taking pictures of her. Step back.

"AITA for making my son do an exercise routine in response to him gaining weight?. My son is 14 years old, and in the past year he has gained 30-40 lbs. I sort of know why, at least I think, its because he now has a lot more free time to hang out with friends at his high school and I figure they eat a lot of junk food with each other. He isn't gaining weight necessarily because hes depressed, he seems very happy at his new school and has lots of friends, but its just that he has more freedom to eat like crap out of the house. 

&#x200B;

When I found this out, I decided to build up an exercise routine for him. The 'rules' are that he has to do it twice a week or he only gets half his allowance (20 bucks instead of 40), but if he does it 4+ times a week, he gets an extra 20 dollars for his allowance. The exercise routine is that he has to ride his bike, either outside or on the stationary bike, for 2 miles, and do 20 minutes of some kind of other exercise, like jumping jacks, push ups etc. Really I am not a stickler for details, if he wants to find some kind of alternative like taking a long walk instead of biking or going swimming, that is fine. I have some kind of app where it records how far hes biked, and the other exercises we do together, so its easy to see what hes doing. 

&#x200B;

Hes resisted this, obviously, no kid likes being forced to exercise, but in the end he has been doing very well for the past two weeks because he knows he would get money at the end for it. My ex wife however, who I am very close with and good friends, found out and absolutely went ballistic on me. She said it was a very overbearing to force a kid to exercise like that, and that I shouldn't be shaming him for being fat and that it probably hurts his self esteem that his own dad feels so badly about him gaining weight. She said that he has complained to her about this and that he now feels absolutely shitty about gaining the weight, but I cant tell if she is exaggerating a bit. I mean, of course hes going to complain about it, but she made it seem as if this kid was emotionally devastated because I asked him to do this. But that being said, what she said did make me feel bad for this. I never really thought about how this might affect his self esteem and how bad it might be to be forcing a teenager to lose weight. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole?","Why don't you do things with him? Instead of implying that he's fat, go for a bike ride with him. Play basketball. Do stuff. Probably be good for you too. Model good exercise and eating habits. Instead of bribing him, just make exercise and healthy eating the norm.

And gaining that much weight in a year I would think a check up with the doctor is in order. Might be fine, might not be.

"AITA for disagreeing with a friend that making characters explicitly gay shouldn't be a thing in media?. So basically me and a mate got into a discussion about tracer in overwatch (a bit late I know but I don't play the game). We got onto the discussion of tracer being outed as lesbian and disagree over whether it was the right thing to do or not. He says yes because it exposes the public to gays and makes them more accepted in mainstream media. I said that if you want to increase acceptance of gays, making a deal of someone being gay or straight is just increasing the alienation by making it into something special and different so it should just be left ambiguous unless it is necessary to the story (eg if the character is married, then you obviously need to decide their sexuality). And if that does happen, don't have an 'announcement' for it, just let it happen. I don't think I'm the ass here, am I?","It wasn't really an ""announcement,"" everybody found out because of a holiday comic which featured Tracer and her girlfriend. It's almost just like another little piece of the lore of her character that happened to be revealed when a little focus was given to her private life. Maybe it isn't necessary to the story, but neither is the majority of the lore and backstory that makes overwatch feel like such a good game despite not having a story mode. If they had just randomly decided to post on twitter ""oh yeah tracer's gay btw"" I would agree that that's somewhat unnecessary but I think the way they revealed it made it perfectly acceptable, and honestly pretty cute ",1,1,0,0,0
"WIBTA if I message an employer about why I didn’t get the job, PMing from a dating website?. So I spent two months applying for this job, and met everybody at the company in person, and everything worked out great. They liked me, I liked them and things looked perfect.

Next day I got an email saying that I got the job and to wait to fill out the rest of the paperwork. I was Excited and started looking for apartments in LA. About five days later I get an email saying they made a Woopsie! And they hired someone they already knew.

Two months later I go to their website and see that exact same job posting I applied for. They reposted it. When I email the recruiter there, they’ve completely ghosted me and won’t respond to why the position I applied for but didn’t get is suddenly posted up again. They won’t even reconsider me for the role.

I had a massive worry throughout the interview, which was that I had met the hiring director on a dating website before. This was the year before I replied. I asked him if he wanted to hang out with me, just to hang out nothing fishy, but he said he was happily married. He thought I wanted to sleep with him! I got embarrassed for asking, and blocked him. When we met in person during the interview I don’t think he recognized me, but I recognized him and didn’t say anything.

Recently I saw his personal ad on that same dating website. He is shirtless. I Felt like unblocking him just to talk.

Would I be the asshole if I messaged him on a dating website, kindly asking him why they passed me up for the position? Or why they aren’t even considering me for any of their other job openings? 

Or am I crossing the line of boundaries and personal space?

PS. This is the gaming industry, this is in LA, and the job in question is an audio, sound designer. I don’t want to say which company.

EDIT: I do not like him that way, I don't want to sleep with him. It was for the job, and it was a really big opportunity. I'm just hurt that I got an e-mail saying I got the job, then another e-mail saying they screwed up. It brings me to tears, this was just such a good opportunity for me. And I sit at night wondering what went wrong.

EDIT: Well I don't think I'm going to ever work for that company, like ever. They are looking for a lot of people and completely ignoring my messages even for new opportunities. I feel like I've already been blacklisted and it's driving me nuts, why?

EDIT: Thank you everyone, I think I got it, it's a dick move. I appreciate everyone who voiced their opinion. He's going to remain blocked on my end.","YTA

"AITA For getting upset at my parents and snapping at my mom when they refused me the flight lessons I earned?. Recently I won a $4000 scholarship to take flight lessons. To get the scholarship I had to submit a community service form (80 hours), a five paragraph essay, and an hour long interview. I am one of the three that won. Over three thousand people applied. 

However, the new semester has started in school and I have been so focused on getting this scholarship that school slipped. My grades dropped severely at the beginning of this quarter and the ending of last. I will admit I put the scholarship before school and sometimes did not have time for homework. I still passed my classes last semester with nothing lower than a high D in one class. On top of that I have been extremely stressed out about the scholarship, family health, and some troubles with my friends. 

Last semester my mom and dad both got very angry at me about my grades since they have never been so low. I was upset at myself but, I didn't know how to fix it and the hole just kep't getting deeper until the last two weeks when I was able to pull it all together. I worked my Christmas break away getting most of the remaining service hours and revising the final essay. 

I had my interview last week and found out I got the scholarship Tuesday afternoon. I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to tell my parents when they got home. When my mom and dad got home i knew something was wrong and when I asked them what it was they started about my grades. Both of my parents are reasonable people and very nice however my mom is not good at seeing other points of view and she overreacts some of time. A little ways into them scolding me about my grades my mom said something like ""I don't know what else you have been doing!"" And that is when I really got upset because she knew that I had been working on this for months now. I responded ""I've been working my ass off getting a scholarship! Which I was going to tell you about but, apparently that doesn't mean anything to you!"" Both my mom and dad were then temporily off the topic of my grades and we discussed my scholarship.

I don't remember how it started back up again but, my mom started getting really angry and started actually yelling about my grades. She kep't saying that I wasn't doing my part in the family and that she didn't think that I was responsible enough to use my scholarship money and said that there would be no lessons until semester ended because I had to stop acting like i didnt care about anything and told me at this rate I would be stuck working at McDonald's. I couldn't believe it and I was furious because the money is void by the end of the year. If I was not able to fly until summer I would miss out on flying until next school year becasue I had planned to work at a Boy scout camp during the summer to fund my flying lessons. If I didn't start now there is a big chance that I would not be able to use all my money as i would only be able to do one or two lessons per week and I couldn't do much flying in November or December as it is very snowy in those months where I live. I would only be able to take half of the projected lessons. 

Without thinking I just yelled ""What do you want me to end up in a dead end job like you!"" I immediatly regreted saying that and my mom just stopped and went to her room. I coulnt believe that I said that and I basically spent the rest of my night just crying in my room. My mom is very upset still and so am I. 

I really feel like a total douchbag but, i just don't know if it was appropriate of my mom to basically tell me I was a burnout and that I wouldn't amount to anything. Am I The Asshole?

TLDR: I earned a scholarship of $4000 for flying lessons but, somewhat neglected school while working on the scholarship. Now my parents are not letting me use my scholarship because of my grades and both my mom and I really hurt each others feelings during an argument about it.




","YTA. I think your parents trying to prevent you from using the scholarship money is a bad idea, but I totally see why they would do so; 80 hours of community service and a short essay is not an excuse for your grades to slip down to Ds. I'd be upset if I was your parents as well, so your comment about your mom's job is really out of line.

Get your grades up. Period. Your only excuse is gone now, so fix the problem. And obviously apologize to your mom.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for ignoring my ex who I still live with?. Our 2 year relationship was great, but recently we drifted apart and realised we wanted different things. Neither of us can afford to move out at the moment so we decided to just be respectful and try to get through the next month or so as easily as possible. 

At first it was weird, we would still go out to eat together, sleep in the same bed, etc. It was as if nothing had changed other than our relationship status. It almost seemed that the distance that had grown between us over the last few months was no longer there. I was reinvesting myself to the idea that this might still be salvageable. We talked about it and she thought this too. 

So we got back together. 

Now, months later, it's happening again for the 3rd time and I recognize the pattern. It's not healthy for either of us to keep dragging ourselves emotionally through the mud like this, so I've told her this time I'd like to go no contact. I'll sleep on the couch, make my own meals, lead a single life essentially. I made this decision several days ago and since then she has been crying nonstop. She's asked for hugs the first couple of days and I only shake my head and walk away. Now she just cries harder everytime we're in the same room. It kills me because I want to be there for her, I just know where that path leads. 

So, am I being an asshole here? ","YTA, you can’t go no contact when you still live in the same house lmao.

"AITA if when after work I remember something important & text it at like 2AM?. I manage 16 teenagers. I give them all the tools they need to succeed. I leave them To Do lists for when I’m not there.

Now I’m having this party pretty last minute and only had less than a week to plan it because Jane decided she didn’t want to plan a party after she said she would, so I decided to not have a lame weekend and plan my own. Now Jane has recently been really rude and insensitive towards me when I come for advice or just want to vent about a rough day. It’s been like this for a few months.

"AITA for hiding the Halloween Candy?. Hello all.

&#x200B;

So, Halloween's coming up, and my family's bought our candy for the year. Just a couple thirty packs of assorted candies. Now, within our household, there's my mom, dad, \[M\]e, and my sister. Me and my sister are both over 18, in college.

Lately, my sister's been snacking on the candy. I decided to hide the candy away where she can't find/reach it. Today, she found out that I hid the candy. She said that she's allowed to have candy if/when she wants to. I replied that we bought that candy specifically for children, on the one day a year children can get as much candy as they can carry \*for free\*.

Our parents found out I hid the candy. My mom's being neutral, and my dad took my sister's side, repeating that it's our house, and she can have candy if she feels like.

"AITA for giving my boyfriend an ultimatum about seeking help for his mental health?. So, sorry about the throwaway, but my boyfriend knows my real username.

  
We've been dating for 4-5 years, known about his mental health issues along the way. Our relationship is good, but of course with ups and downs like every relationship.

&#x200B;

He was diagnosed with having social anxiety issues last year, but he also suffers from depression and seasonal affective disorder. The latter is a huge problem as we live in Scandinavia, where we at worst in winter get about 4 hours of sunlight a day. 

We've had discussions about his mental health before - I have nudged him into getting help, and he tried last year. He regularly visited a psychiatrist for about 7 months, until he was placed on a course for people to challenge and explore their social anxiety. Unfortunately, this required him to make phone calls etc, which he is rightfully not able to do yet. The course moved too quickly, and he was eventually dropped for not taking contact.

This was a blow to his self esteem, and we have talked a bit about it. We didnt agree on anything, but I made it clear to him that I was proud of his effort, but that tackling such a huge issue would be with a ton of uphill battles and downfalls along the way. 

Today I came home from visiting a friend, to a house with all lights turned off, and he was lying in bed. He had a bad evening, and the seasonal affect disorder is now coming in.

I told him that I felt like I made a lot of effort to accomodate my own mental health issues (which I've adressed by going regularly to a psychiatrist, and a lot of courses on ways to think etc) for him, but that he doesn't give enough effort to do the same.

&#x200B;

I know I probably should have put this to him at a different time, but when I've tried that, we both usually end up forgetting it as he is in a good period that we both hope will last. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for telling him that he is not putting enough effort into his mental health?","YTA mostly because it was the wrong time and the wrong way to put it. If he already feels like he can't do anything telling him ""You're not doing anything"" is not gonna fix a damn thing. 

Better idea would go to counseling with him so you know what he has to try and how you can gently nudge him towards progress. I don't get why more people don't do this. Family, partners - actually learn about what is going to help this individual. I have enough werewithal that I can explain to my partner what he can do to help me when I am anxious (my problem is GAD, not depression, though I've been there).

If he can't do that, you need to try it yourself. Ask of he can make a therapy appointment (not with a psychiatrist since that's more medical) with both of you to help guide both of you through ways to help and how you can support. Or see if there are classes.

But don't just throw him out in the cold (metaphorical) if he's not making progress. Some people that can help. But some you can end up making it way worse.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for calling out first year uni students for lying about how much sex they had?. So I (22M) am a masters student at university and my friend (21M) dragged me along to a birthday pres which had a lot of first year students (mainly aged 18, some 19). 

It was a mix of guys and girls. One of the drinking games is called ''Never Have I Ever'' and its almost always sexual. 

It was more of a thing you do in first year rather than other years, and people in first year usually lie about the sexual things they've done. I know this because I was a first year who used to do the same thing. My friends from year admitted they did the same too.

So during this game, there were about 4 girls (18F) and 3 guys (18M, 18M and 19M) and my friend and me. And the first years were saying stuff like ''Never Have I Ever....had sex with more than 30 people'' and they'd all drink. And ''Never Have I Ever...had sex with a teacher'' and they'd all drink. And even ''Never Have I Ever...had sex in public'' and all drank.

They had a huge /r/ihavesex vibe.

I know for a fact that these 18 year old kids, were chatting shit. An 18 year old who is coming into uni from sixth form/college is highly, highly, highly unlikely to have done all these things (especially 30 people, wtf?). I know how they feel, I've been there and done that, wanting to fit in, but I felt it was so cringey that I just called them out on it. I said ''Never Have I Ever...chatted shit about how much sex I've had'' and they all looked at me confused. So I said to them ''Look, I know you lot are first years, but I know you're chatting shit about all this stuff. You don't need to lie to fit in''.

They looked a bit startled, and there was an awkward silence. A bit later I overheard one of the girls saying I was a huge asshole, AITA?","YTA and a party pooper.

Of course they’re lying. They’re first years. They’re young, inexperienced, impressionable, they’re trying to establish a new identity, and they want to have a bit of fun.

You did the same thing. Your friends did the same thing.

All you did was ruin their vibe because you’ve moved on from your undergrad days. You should have just let them have it. Let them navigate their new sense of independence, even if it does mean letting them talk shit about the 30 teachers they’ve slept with.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for no longer wanting to associate with my boyfriend’s friends?. Let me start this off by saying I used to have a problem with my old friend group. I was excluded from plans and belittled, and as such I cut most of them out as I had no wish to be treated that way.

Right now I’m going through something similar with my bf’s friends. They exclude me from plans a lot, ignore me when I’m around and some things have been said behind my back: like they don’t know me due to my so-called drinking issue (meanwhile drinks are pushed on me when we’re out), and they feel like I’m not showing my real self (I have severe anxiety which causes a lot of social problems, this has been communicated with them).

Now I’ve brought up to my bf before that I feel excluded, and I feel uncomfortable and lonely when around them. He usually says that it sucks, and he doesn’t understand why they don’t try harder to befriend me. Tonight I had had enough, as I learned of some plans to which I wasn’t invited, and I told him I didn’t think it was worth it for me to continue trying to be their friend. I basically put it as “I don’t care if you see them but I’m not going to keep trying to befriend them if they don’t want to get to know me.”  He agreed but seemed kind of upset that I said that.

Now I’m not sure what to do. Was I being the asshole by telling him that and refusing to continue to try and be friends with them?","INFO: Why in your opinion is everyone treating you poorly? Mentioning that you have cut off both all of your friends and all your boyfriend's friends is concerning, especially when you also mention that others feel you have a drinking problem. If you have lots of friends that delight in your company, its totally OK to cut out a group of people you don't enjoy. If you cut off everyone you know, repeatedly, you should do a little introspection. Severe anxiety issues are difficult to deal with sometimes.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA because I get tired of people's BS quickly. Ok. This is all going to sound quite stupid to some people, but I need to figure out if I'm an asshole or what. I don't think I am.... but I also may be wrong.

I have the tendency of sometimes getting fed up with people, and almost wanting to drop them from my life. I had a friend once who when I was helping her with an art show, started treating me like her intern, even though I was helping her as a friend, not an employee. Because of this, I basically distanced myself enough to the point that I discarded the friendship. To be honest, there were a lot of other little things that she was doing that showed she wasn't a good friend to have, and was a dishonest person. So I know I'm not the asshole for that.

But now, I have another friend that I had started to consider close and whenever we speak the conversation is extremely self centered towards her. She went away to Italy several weeks ago, and she was constantly sending me selfies asking if she looked good, and telling me about all of the attention that she was receiving from men. I LOVE when people love themselves, but it got to a point where she was bragging and I started feeling annoyed. There was a point when she hung up on me without saying bye, just to upload something onto her Instagram story. When she was in Italy, she was constantly leaving her travel partner to seek attention from other men. Thing is, she's not a bad person, and she's gone through a lot this year, so I get why the conversation seems to be geared towards her life -- but when she asks ""how are you?"" and I begin talking about my day, etc, she gears it back towards her. She can spend an hour rambling about her, and her coworkers, her coworker's siblings, TBH SHIT I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT. This may not be on purpose, but it's frustrating. It may be because her group of friends since childhood praise each other, and maybe she wants the same from me but I don't really operate that way. I've decided to kind of distance myself the last couple days because I really didn't have mental space for her.

Am I the asshole because I tend to want to just distance people from my life without really giving them a shot to make things okay or even let them know why they're bothering me?

Am I overthinking!?!?!? I don't know!! I feel like I sound like a dumbass. Please let me know.

"AITA for being pissed at my friend for ditching me?. So I’ve got real close with a coworker and I consider him as one of my closest friends. We had a safety meeting this morning and we were supposed to go smoke with some other coworkers afterwards, but since I had to work in a few hours I suggested we hit the gym instead. He said yes, and until the other co workers (girls) asked if he was gonna smoke or not and he was told me we should lift after I get out of work, but I couldn’t. He told me we should go on separate times to the gym then (mind you we’re gym buddies) and finally he was like okay let’s go now then, but I could tell he wanted to go smoke with the girls and not lift. So then I told him to forget about it and that I was going by myself. I was pretty pissed since he was being persuaded probably by the hope of getting it on with one of the girls and now I’m reflecting on our friendship. I’m I right to be pissed or was he wrong? I’m I overreacting?

"AITA for not wanting my moms boyfriend to sleepover while I’m having a sleepover?. *PLEASE READ*
Backstory: 
It has always been my mother and I for as long as I can remember, my father was abusive. August 2018, she started dating him and every weekend since they’ve seen each other. It’s come to the point, where he sleeps over two nights a week. ( of course when I asked her not have him overnight my request was deemed “manipulative” mostly because it didn’t match hers  and was overridden) (to be quite honest their relationship has put me in a bad mental state, I feel so alone ) I’ve put up a fight and pleaded with her, but it didn’t work and now we are where we are. 

So February 27th is my birthday, I had a family dinner and birthday party. I asked him not to come to any, but no. Even though, my therapist said it would be best that he would only come to one of them, but my mom refused.  March 1st is my birthday party. I don’t have many friends as I’ve got social anxiety and find it hard to make friends. The friends that I didn’t invited backed out all but one. So I asked my mom if the person coming to my party could sleep over and she said yes. And then asked if her boyfriend could not sleep over that Saturday (ONE DAY OUT OF TWO)  and she said “no we would talk about it when she got home.” I knew what was going to happen as it happened when I asked if he could only go to one of the events, she would come home and argue about it and the result would still be in her favor. 

So I went to her boyfriend and asked if couldn’t have to stay the night. He is very understanding and nice. He got me a cockatiel after my bird died and a bike for my birthday. I don’t have a problem with him.  He said “No problem”

When my mom found out she was furious. 

I don’t really know anymore. I know I shouldn’t of asked him, but it’s supposed to be my night. Its my birthday party after all and it’s just one night.  She’s controlling everything, all the guest are her friends and Im only bringing one. Every time I ask  someone I know in real life, they say I should  be happy for my mother. I’m really looking for your answers please answer, while writing this I’m crying and holding my cat. It’s helped calm me down, it’s weird I know but sometime I feel my cats the only one that loves me %100 and is the only thing  that would never screw me over 
","Except we have no indication whatsoever that they're going to, the person above you asked ""what if the kids *thought* they were having sex?""

"AITA for not telling my wife I was going out for a drink?. I’ll try to make this short and to the point without too many details. I (M 35) and my wife (F 31) went out for a movie tonight. Didn’t do any dinner or drinks before hand, just went for the movie. We got home around 8:30 pm and she was ready for bed because she gets up at 5 am for work. I on the other hand work nights and don’t technically HAVE to wake up until late afternoon, so I have a much later schedule, naturally. As I’m tucking her into bed she asks me if I was going out tonight. I told her yes, I was gonna go grab a beer at the local bar and come home and make it an early night (relatively speaking). She flipped and told me I was wrong for not telling her I was going out without being prompted. Side note; I also gave up smoking/vaping a few months ago, but I’ve been jonesing pretty bad the last week, then I remembered I still had an old vape pod in my night stand and I never threw out the battery. I’ve been hitting it a few times at night before bed to help relax myself as I have a hard time sleeping too. I never tried to hide it from her as I left the vape out in plain sight. So she knows what I’ve been doing but I never outright told her but I knee she knew. She sights this, along with not volunteering I was going out, as another reason she can’t trust me. Despite not giving her any other reasons. I told her that she was being controlling and I shouldn’t have to tell her everything I’m doing at all times.

"AITA for getting upset over a wig?. TLDR:  Mentioned I was into red hair, friend amazon primed a red wig as a joke, wife and I laughed about it but she wouldn't try it on, cleaning up several months later going to throw it away and try one more time get her to wear it, wife again declines and accuses me of trying to change her not being satisfied with her natural hair etc...

My wife and I have been together since dating in high school, married for just over 9 years now.  We're a pretty vanilla couple, been faithful to each other had a couple of kids and enjoy each other.  We don't get into disagreements often, we usually defer to the other in order to avoid conflict.

It was innocent enough, somehow the conversation got onto hair colors at a party and I mentioned that I kinda had a thing for red hair.  A couple days later found a mystery Amazon package on the porch and opened it to find a red wig inside.  We figured out it was a friend at the party who had sent it as a joke, my wife and I laughed about it.  She wouldn't try it on complaining that it made her head itch thinking about it.

The wig got tossed on a shelf and forgotten about for several months.  We were cleaning and organizing this morning and found the wig once again.  I asked wife to try it on for me before we threw it away but she still wouldn't.  She accused me of not loving her as she is, wanting to change her, not caring that it made her itch thinking about it.  I told her I wasn't asking her to change her hair, I do love her natural hair color the red is just kinda my thing and I wanted to see what she would look like.

As it goes this stupid red wig has become a big deal.  I'm annoyed she wouldn't just try it on for me, she thinks I'm unsatisfied and ""hate her hair"".  I had to leave shortly after the dispute, I texted her and apologized for being upset but she's left me on read for several hours now.",YTA for pushing her to wear a wig.

"WIBTA if I tell my roommate he can't host a Bible study in our apartment?. A number of weeks ago, I overheard my roommate talking about a weekly Bible study he was going to host in our apartment. I knew this Bible study would affect me in a negative way, so I suggested he try to host it somewhere else. He said ""I'll look into it."" I knew he wasn't actually going to look into it, but I didn't push the issue further at this time.

Today, I told him that I'd really appreciate it if he found somewhere else to host the Bible study. He responded ""I'll look into it"" with no guarantee it will be moved. When I pressed the issue a bit further, he said that ""When it comes down to it, I can have people over sometimes, and you can too. It's give and take""

Now, before I ask you guys the question, I'll explain what the Bible study is and how it affects me. 

There are two parts of the Bible study: First, they play the board game, ""Secret Hitler."" I don't know how this game is played, but I know it involves lots of arguing and is loud af. This part lasts for about an hour, and prevents me from being productive in the apartment. Even with noise cancelling headphones, I can still hear them yelling in the other room, and it's difficult to focus. 

Second, they have the ""Bible part."" This is the part where they talk about life, discuss the Bible, and pray. This part lasts about half an hour. This part of the Bible study affects me more than the ""Secret Hitler"" part. I grew up in the church, but don't have fond memories of it. When I hear them talking like people talked at Sunday school and youth group, it brings up a lot of bad emotions. It also makes me really uncomfortable to be in a room full of people essentially talking bad things about my choices (Leaving the church, not reading the Bible, ""living a life of sin"") even though the conversation isn't directed at me.

When I talked to him today, he essentially said tough luck to me if he can't find another spot, because he'd still host it in that case.

So, WIBTA if push the issue further and tell him he has to move the Bible study, regardless of whether he finds a new spot for it?

TL;DR

My roommate hosts a weekly Bible study in my apartment. It brings up bad memories for me because it reminds me of when I was a part of the church. WIBTA if I told him he can't host it here even if he doesn't find a new place for it?

Edit: made it clear that Secret Hitler is a board game","YWBTA, he's allowed to have people over as much as you are. I understand your concern, is there somewhere you can be whilst he is having the bible study?

"AITA for not spending time with my boyfriend?. I (M20) have been living with my boyfriend (M25) since October.  


For the past 5 months since moving here I've had issues making new friends. I've worked with the elderly in a retirement home as a full time job for 4 months, with colleagues well above my age. While this isn't an issue for me, it doesn't lend it's hand to that many free time hangouts. I knew 1 person (let's call her L) in the town prior to moving and we're very close, so apart from my bf she's been the only person I've seen, maybe once or twice a week.

I love my boyfriend, but we are /very/ different people. He's into politics, he's orderly and he likes simplicity and elegance. I'm more reminiscent of a passing tornado. Quite messy, pretty impulsive, and slightly more chaotic. While this does lead to arguments, we usually have strong communication and always seek good compromises.

The winter periods hit me pretty hard because of some trauma from my childhood and because of this I haven't had much energy to go out and do activities, meaning I've been pretty much stuck at work or at home. My boyfriend is super supportive of me and he's a great help and comfort throughout these periods.

A month ago I started seeing a psychologist and things have been steadily moving in the right direction. I have more energy during the day, I feel less overpowered by my own thoughts and I've been wanting to spend my time outside of the house. I also started school again and met a few interesting people, one of whom (Let's call him M) I hung out with after school last Friday, right before a 9 day winter break. We clicked pretty quickly, and since then M and I have hung out a total of 5 of the 9 days we've been off school. I didn't realize how much I had been missing speaking to like-minded people, and I've honestly been really stoked about making my first friend that hasn't been introduced to me by L.

So here's where issue comes in. My bf asked me if I wanted to go out an do something together this Sunday (nothing specific), to which I replied that I wasn't sure if I had time, because maybe I was doing something with M (we had talked about doing sketches at a skatepark, but hadn't actually planned anything yet). This led to my boyfriend first getting sad (and later angry), because he felt he was being used as ""an option, in case there wasn't anything more exciting to spend time on"". I understand why he's sad, but we live together, so we see eachother every day, and finally I'm actually talking to people I can somewhat relate to in my free time. I admit that he's been moved down on my priority list these days, but it's also only been a week. It's not like I'm ditching him forever because I found a friend, I've just been very caught up in the excitement that followed from not feeling alone anymore. I also know he's been struggling a bit at work, but we've talked about it multiple times and I personally do feel like I've been there for him. I've thought that maybe he's been needing a day together for a while, but hasn't been vocal about it, and maybe that's why it got to him so hard. He's also quite a private person, so despite living here for 1½ years, he hasn't made many friends outside of work, meaning I'm a big part of his daily social interactions.

So we have lived together now for a year with little to no real incidents of any kind, especially with money. I tend to borrow money from him but ALWAYS pay him back in reasonable time. 

Today, I made a last minute haircut appointment that left me no time to stop by an ATM, one that wouldn't charge me a fee, since my barber only takes cash.

She hasn't been able to work for less than a year because of VISA/citizenship stuff, but all of that is coming together and now she is able to. Unfortunately, her line of work isn't that big where we are so either a commute or move is required. Once working, she'll be making WAY more than I am. She has savings which she has been using for expenses in the down time.

Now at this point, I was torn. On the one hand, they rescued this kitten. On the other hand, there is NO WAY a deaf cat can be left outdoors. It has very limited natural defense to other predators, dogs, snakes, cars, and other cats. She would almost certainly die a very premature death.

So we moved from Arizona to California shortly after that, but I kept the cat and never told them about it since, obviously, I don't want to be arrested for stealing and I want to continue to give this cat a good home.

She's strictly an indoor cat, and gets along fine with my other two indoor cats. She's grooming herself at my feet right now.

I know IATA for stealing the cat and making them feel like the cat got killed. That's a horrible feeling. But the way I think about it, there was a very good chance that this cat was going to get killed anyway, and they were going to feel horrible anyway. And I saved a cat. So overall, the net good-bad  is positive, so NTA.","YTA - you stole someone’s cat rather then having a reasonable conversation with them first. 

When I was a kid we had neighbours that would go in and out of our yard and leave the gate open. Our little dog Sammy would escape and there was a lady on the corner that always picked him up and tried to hide him from us. 

4 days before we moved cross country our gate was mysteriously left open and Sammy went missing never to be seen again.

I guarantee that neighbour lady hid him and I was the most heart broken 8 year old ever.

"AITA for telling my older brother I am going to cut ties with him after finding out his son isn’t his?. My older brother and I have not had the best of relations. As he has gotten older I have just lost a lot of respect for him. He has constantly let women take advantage of him, he used to be the guy that would buy his female friends gifts and Starbucks just cause he was a nice guy.

He got married to a woman whom I thought was a terrible match. She has two kids from previous relationships by different men. And she doesn’t work either. And she buys things on amazon constantly.

When I told him that he needs to change things he told his wife everything and she told him that I am weak that I can’t handle a woman with life experience.

Now he found out three weeks before his dude date from his wife that his son is probably not his. And she is worried that he might come out mixed race and to let friends and family know.

I told my brother he needs to get out. He told me he thought about it but realized that he is the best person to be the father that the original dad is not a good fit.

I told him that was it I lost respect for him. He called me a racist. I told him I don’t care what his opinions of me are.

"AITA for not wanting to be disturbed while watching TV?. A little bit of a rant because this just keeps happening.

For context - I don't live with my parents anymore, but I'm visiting them at least twice a month because they're my parents and I like hanging out with them.

They own a pretty neat TV system so sometimes I when I visit them I plopp down on the couch and enjoy some Netflix in my pyjamas. 

Now to my issue: My mom likes to sit down next to me and watch parts of the movie with me, I enjoy that. But on more than one occasion, she just does loud things, including turning her phone to 'loud mode' so you can hear every tip and notification on her cell phone, she has phone conversations while sitting there, she watches videos people send her on whatsapp.
And everytime I told her: I don't mind you being on the phone while watching a movie with me but just try to be quiet so I can focus, and everytime she tells me ""you're being a mean and egoistic person for saying so""

Today she hit the final straw by bringing her laptop and watching minute long recordings from old family holidays. I repeatedly asked her to either put headphones in or turn it down, or, if it's important to her, watch it in her room, or even wait until the movie is over so I can watch them with her, to which she again, replied ""you can be so mean sometimes"" and ""it's my house so I can do what I want"" and ""why is this such a problem it's not like you can't see the movie anyway?""

I didn't think I was being mean, I just told her I think it's really impolite to do that while someone is watching a movie (especially since it was one of my favorites, planet of the apes, which she knows!)

She's currently not talking to me because of that and I seriously considering going back to my place because the mood is ice cold because of that.

So, TL;DR:  WIBTA by repeatedly asking my mom not to be loud in her house while I was watching a movie?

Edit: I appreciate that all of you took the time to respond - sometimes you think your view on things is the right and pragmatic one even though it isn't.

I'd just like to clarify something that was brought up in the comments: No, I don't visit my parents just to watch TV. Most of the time is filled with talking, eating together and asking how everyone has been. The movie watching is something I generally do in the evenings, when everyone kind of does their own thing.

This doesn't change that my behaviour was apparently rude, so i'll try to talk to her and apologize.

"AITA for stopping talking to an ambiguous good friend?. So I met a boy last year, let's call him Mike. we quickly became very good friends. However, I have a bf (it's been 3y) and only wanted friendship w/ Mike. He knew that, and although he told me that there was no ambiguity, many of my friends thought that we looked a lot like flirting and that he seemed interested. At 1st I didn't believe it and was happy to finally find a friend to be comfortable with, as I usually hate any kind of physical contact other than from my bf (who was okay w/ Mike as soon as he didn't try anything).  


But, he suddenly put a lot of distance between us, w/o any warning. Then, during 2 months : I'd ask him why he was distant, he'd make excuses (1st it happened to him sometimes, then he was sick of his friends teasing him about us being a couple, then he didn't like physical contact though he was the 1st one to initiate it), talk to me for a week or 2 and then become distant again. I became fed up by his mood swings, and a friend of mine managed to make him admit lowkey that he started to have feelings for me. Though, he's always found a way to avoid the subject when I tried to confront him. I started developing feelings for him too, but wanted to stay with my bf, who I love v much. So I decided to tell Mike about my feelings, but also how fedup I was, and that I'd stop talking to him to protect my couple and try to forget him. He said he understood, apologized for his behavior, and if I wanted to talk to him again, he'd be there.  


after he tried to interact with me, by working same place same hours as mine/trying to talk to me/smile at me. Then, he's had serious troubles that I had to take care of. I decided I had to prioritize making sure he was ok.  


So we became friends again. And same. We'd talk to/see each other a lot during a week, then he'd ignore me during another one. Then ask to see me.  


My friends told me to just stop talking to him without explanation, but I didn't want to do the exact thing I blamed him for. So I decided to put and end, but by sending him a bitter message (to make sure he wouldn't try to talk to me again) in which I explained that I didn't understand his behavior, that even though I really appreciated our friendship, it hurt me more than made me feel good, so I wanted to end it.  


He replied that no one had ever annoyed him about that, that he'd made a lot of efforts to be friends with me as I wanted, and that I was an AH to say it was his fault while I asked myself way too many questions about our friendship. He concluded that he was disappointed, but that maybe we weren't made to be friends, and that he'd leave me alone.  


To some of my friends' pov, it was a dick move from me. To my bf's pov, it's too bad since we got along very well, but he's at least happy that I don't feel guilty anymore for also having feelings for someone else. Though, I regret it a little, and I feel like an AH for my whole behavior.  


So, AITA?","Yeah YTA. Once you knew his feelings and set your boundaries. You shouldn't have told him your ""feelings"" for him if you were that sure about your relationship with your bf.

"WIBTA if I de-invite my friends to my grad party?. I had my graduation party today and I invited all of my closest friends from school and only one of them showed up. To be completely honest, it really hurt because they were my only life line during the school year. I went through spikes of depression and struggled with school work a lot but they were always there to help me and see if I was doing ok so I was really hurt to see them not show up. I’m having another party later tonight to that of which my dad encouraged as he sees me as a man now and bought me a decent of alcohol. My dad is taking car keys away and is letting anyone stay the night if they feel the need to so there is no need to worry about that. But the thing is that my friends have been pretty distant throughout the summer and rarely invited me to hang out. When I originally sent out invites, they were kinda monotone about showing up but the moment I mentioned alcohol they pretty much all said that they’ll be there the moment the graduation party starts. The party later tonight is supposed to be just like a normal party, just to hang out and have fun. I invited all my coworkers who are close to the same age as me (they couldn’t show up earlier because they were working, i know they weren’t lying because i checked out work schedule) and there are quite a bit of people showing up. But I don’t if I should de-invite the people who were supposed to attend to my grad party.

"AITA for not helping my new friends set up their camping equipment?. I recently (a couple of months ago when I moved out of my family home) joined  a group of close friends. We all usually get on really well and have a lot of laughs together.

Recently we decided to go on a camping excursion. For context, it's me, a brother (We'll call him Simon) and sister (Karen) who are quite new to camping, and a guy (Alan) who's a bit older and more experienced in travelling (as well as his pet furball).

Although I've never really done camping before, I know I like to travel quite light. I carry all my own stuff as I don't feel it's right to burden other people with my things. For context, I'm from a rather wealthy family and I've always been a little mollycoddled, which I kind of hate, so I try to avoid burdening people as much as possible. My sight isn't great either, so my family have always been way overprotective of me.

After carrying my stuff to the campsite, I was asked to help set up their tent by Karen. I reminded her that I was sleeping in my own tent and that I carried all my own things, so I felt it was fair that I set up my stuff and they set up their stuff. I even carried my own food! Karen started yelling at me telling me that they needed help and I should stop being so selfish.

That evening, to Karen's credit she came and apologised saying that we're all a little tired from the long journey to the campsite. I feel like she was trying to insinuate that we were both to blame by saying that we were ""all"" a little tired, which I felt was unfair, but I let it go for the sake of the excursion.

Later, we had to move camp because some big lizards had started invading our area and again Karen demanded I help them unpack. Again, I reminded her that I carried my own weight. She started screaming in my face. When Alan tried to calm her down she yelled at him too. Later that night she was quite nasty towards me, even mocking my poor eyesight by commenting that it was a ""shame"" that I couldn't see the stars.

Needless to say, it wasn't the best trip I've ever had. I put her anger down to tiredness but a few people have said to me that I should have just helped.

So Reddit, Am I the Asshole?

EDIT:

T hanks for all the replies. Got a bit of a range on whether or not I'm an asshole so I concede that maybe I didn't go about it the right way

O n the day we agreed we should all camp together, I was very upfront about the fact that I wanted to be quite self-reliant on the trip. I really wanted to go on the journey to show myself that I was able to be independent and look after myself, and that was my focus.

P erhaps I should have made my desires more clear. I still think it is unfair to expect me to help, when I specifically packed light so I wouldn't have to spend a lot of time/effort carrying/setting up things.

H owever, I also disagree with those who are saying horrible things about Karen. Although Karen is younger than her brother, she is like the mother of the group. She cares for us all greatly. She has a background in healthcare and I have voiced my appreciation before that she could help with first aid should any unsavoury situations arise. We were all quite sleep deprived and so I think she acted out because of that. She's really a gentle person. I'm usually more of the tough one. I perhaps should have just apologised. Don't want our friendship to get rocky.","I'm not saying be their packmule or anything, but you don't sound very fun to camp with.

"WIBTA if I stopped giving gifts to only one of my twin nephews?. Okay, I know this sounds bad. So, my husband's sister has five kids and the two youngest are 9.5 year old twins. I have significant issues with the children's mother, but I don't believe it's their fault that their mother is empirically terrible. So when we visit, I often (but not always) like to bring each boy a small gift. Nothing too outrageous - a book or a small toy, in the five to 10 dollar range. 

One child, no matter what we bring him is delighted and surprised that we got him a gift. He thanks us and is quite effusive in that thanks.

His twin brother, no matter what we bring HIM, complains that it's not right. He's already read it, or it isn't something that interests him, or some sort of issue. Never ""thank you,"" never ""appreciate the effort,"" nothing. Just whines that it isn't a good present.

So, I don't enjoy picking out or getting gifts for the second boy. It's nothing but complain, complain. On the other hand, the first boy is such a joy to give gifts to and I don't want to stop giving him little gifts because his brother is kind of a jerk about it all.

So, WIBTA if I stopped bringing a nice small gift for boy two?

Edit: Many of you have suggested that I talk to him about how it isn't appropriate to react this way when someone gives you a gift. I have. We have had that conversation several times. I have also asked him, multiple times, what interests him. He says ""Nintendo and youtube."" Those are the sum total of his current interests. I'm trying, I really am.

Additional edit: in the interest of full disclosure, I have had increased difficulty in dealing with the twins (both of them, but in particular this other one) since my husband and I had a stillbirth last year. I am trying not to take this out on the kid, but I get so pissed at the mother. I know I would not be a perfect Mom, I know that - but holy shit, I would do better than this! Anyway, I don't know if this is playing into it at all, but I figure the more information you guys have, the better you can provide constructive advice. Look, I really do want the best for this kid. He just pisses me off.

FINAL EDIT: I have been judged TA. I will continue to give the children gifts of approximate equal value and work on getting things more aligned with his interests. I will also make sure that if he complains that I will simply take the gift back and politely remind him that these gifts are not a requirement. Hopefully we will both do better going forward.","YWBTA if you did it in that manner. At that age, we are supposed to act like the world is this fair, safe space for them to grow up in.

I think it's stupid and dangerous for your health, and she's obviously missing nutrients, but she refuses to see logic and reason.

Never have, never will. The only people who are vegan are her, her fiance, and some of their friends. Our parents agree with me that she can't do this, and exclude everyone.

I feel like the title is a little misleading simply because I wasn’t sure how to concisely explain the flat situation; I live in uni dorms where my floor (a ‘flat’) has only girls living there. It doesn’t mean guys aren’t allowed there, it’s just that only girls live there.

My male friends called if they could come over to ask a question and so we stood in the hallway talking for roughly seven minutes. During this time, one of the flatmates walked out of the bathroom in a towel.

I didn’t think much of this until she sent a message in the group chat asking that ‘whoever’s male mates were standing around’ could go into their room instead, as ‘people were in towels’. 

Should I have let my friends into my room? I thought it’d be relatively quick so I didn’t bother, but I feel bad for making her uncomfortable. I can see why there’d be an expectation for no guys to be around, but other people’s male friends have been around before.

"AITA for not going on a date with a guy in a wheelchair even though we had really good chemistry?. This happened a few weeks ago:

I have not had much luck with online dating. Guys on apps are either creepy right off the bat or slowly become creepy as the conversation gets deeper. 


So, in comes this guy, let's call him Jackson. I matched with him and we spoke for several days and he seemed to be the only dude that was not strange. Kind of took me by surprise because at any point I expected things like ""so do you want to hook up?"" like I've received from guys before. But Jackson was very different and actually asked me about my day, discussed my hobbies and I really enjoyed talking to him. He also mentioned that he hadn't had much luck with online dating as well so I was able to relate to him on that too. 


After a few days, he was the only one I had been actively talking to and moved onto texting instead of being on the app. When he had asked me to meet up for a lunch date, I instantly said that I would do my best to request the day off from work. I immediately scheduled for the day off and it got approved but when I had entered the messages again, I noticed he said “but wait, before you do that, are you okay with me being in a wheelchair?” I told him “that’s totally fine” but that was more of a knee-jerk response because I actually wasn’t fine. I was glad he was upfront with me about that before we went on the date, rather than finding out when I got there. 


So, the day before the date, I texted him “Sorry, they called me in so I have to go to work.” I had actually just cancelled the day off and went to work anyways. He replied “no problem, we’ll schedule for another time then.” A few days passed and we hadn’t talked and he sent a final message saying “I’m sorry” and he then proceeded to un-match me on the dating app too.

I was on my 9th plate when he came up to me, we had probably been there for about three hours. He was nice at first and goes on the spill about how they have the right to limit quantity in the TOS and that we have already went far over what the computer would give him credit for. He told us that most people “only eat 2-3 plates and they are stuffed.” He said he thanked us for our business but we could not have anymore food that night unless we paid for a second buffet, otherwise we needed to leave. 

So I got up after he left the area and fixed another plate.  (At this point, I was pretty pissed off. Who is this mindless meathead trying to tell me what to do?)

I was stupid and immature and got involved with a married man which I cringe at now. But when I was pregnant he begged me to get rid of it but I didn’t. He ended up having to come clean to his wife and they quickly moved to the other side of the country to get away from me. He sent me support but I never stopped resenting him for abandoning me to raise my daughter alone.

I’ve decided to move me and my daughter to their state this summer so that she’ll hopefully form tighter relationships with her half-siblings since she craves meeting more family after a lifetime of just me and her.

I emailed the wife and her response to me was nothing short of hostile. She said I’ve ruined her life enough and to leave them alone. She also made some physical threats to both me and my daughter if we find her house.

She's also taken the car to the dealer directly as the car was booked in for a service with them on Monday, and she told me they said they'll email me with a quote. So far so good.

When I got home tonight I told her I would forward her their email so she could compare it with the spray shop and to go with whichever she preferred. She looked at me like I'd come into her house on Christmas and pissed on her kids. She asked me why I would forward it to her, that she knows nothing about cars (or how to drive one, clearly) and then accused me of trying to punish her by making her deal with it all.

I told her that no, I did not want to deal with it and that I would like her to sort it out.

So I'm sat here on my own while my wife has gone to cool off because apparently I'm an asshole for asking her to clean up her own mess.

So... AITI?

*Edit* I'm not asking her to pay for it - it'll be paid for from a joint bank account. I just don't feel like it's my responsibility to chase around getting quotes and then taking the car to be fixed. I also feel like I should be allowed to be a bit bitter that her carelessness has just cost us the better part of $500.","Nah, if she doesn’t know anything about cats how do you expect her to make the right choice? Not every paint shop is the same and the price difference alone shouldn’t be the only thing taken into consideration. She more then likely assumes you know more then her about cars and would prefer the more experienced person make the call. That makes perfect sense to me. I’ve work in a Body Shop and trust me, you don’t want her handling this. They’ll swindle her. They won’t do that with you.

"WIBTA if I fired someone after a cancer scare and surgery?. I have an employee who is very caring and thoughtful.  She occasionally cooks for customers and other employees.  She loves to be helpful-she has given her favorite coat to a stranger in need and she has worked 16hrs a day to cover for others.  She will do any job that needs to be done, even those that others refuse to do.  The only breaks she takes are smoke breaks for 4 minutes.

The problem is her attitude.  She talks all day about who has died that she vaguely knows, money, who is screwing up, and how hard it is to have 4-5 rental properties. 4 people have quit specifically because of how she treated them.  The first 2 I thought they needed to grow up and learn how to deal with difficult personalities. Now I know it’s her that needs to learn to get along with others and not boss people around.  She blames it on her tone, it’s really her words that get to people.

NO ONE works hard enough for her.  She belittles new employees; her favorite saying is “it’s common sense.”  Most of the time it is a situation you would only know what to do after seeing it done 4-5 times. She tells the customers that she is the only one that does any work.  She has a lot of them convinced that the place would fall apart without her.  She even has criticized someone who has worked there for over 20 years, saying he was lazy and didn’t know how to do his job.  But she will spend an hour on something that I think is a waste of time and expect me to thank her profusely.  I try to create a relaxed atmosphere at work, but she usually undermines me.  She makes everything seem life or death, even if it’s how to count money.

 She would do anything for people, but it comes with a catch.  She has told people that they don’t owe her anything for what she did for them, but if she needs something done, they should do it since she did something nice for them.  Pretty much the definition of owing someone.

She is such an odd mixture of being a wonderful person and being unforgiving of mistakes and having a sense of superiority.  I just don’t know what to do with her.  I feel badly about her health scare and she keeps saying I saved her life by forcing her to finally go to the doctor.  The truth is, this last week without her has been wonderful.  Everyone is breathing a sigh of relief without her there to judge every action.

"AITA for using my deceased sisters name as my chosen middle name?. Throwaway as most of my family is on reddit, and knows my account.  


So I am MtF transgender. Coming up on a few months on hormones and getting to the point of changing my name to something more feminine , for clarification I have a first name already picked out, I'm not trying to replace my sister.

Growing up my parents always talked about my sister (lets call her Janet) who died when we were both extremely young due to birth complications. Knowing this I always wondered what it would have been like having Janet grow up besides me, maybe she could have helped with really figuring things out? My parents were always strict when I was trying out new things, like they threatened to shave my head if I ever dyed my hair and when I painted my nails they always grabbed my arm and forced me to take it off. 

I am currently out to my parents (they aren't happy in the slightest) and I'm currently living on my own trying to make the best out of it, so in memory of Janet I had the idea of using her name as a middle name, so instead of my name being James Eric Jones it would be Veronica Janet Jones. Of course none of my family knows about this idea, as the backlash could be... physical. So I'm avoiding telling them as long as I can.

"WIBTA for telling my brother's fiance to get her driver's license?. Okay so here's the deal..

Brother and his fiance have been engaged for 5 years, dating for over 10 years.

Brother is 29, his fiance is about to turn 28. No driver's license, no permit. She had a permit in the state I currently live in, but never pursued getting her license.

It's obvious to point out he takes her everywhere.. Shopping, restaurants, parties, family visits, etc.

We used to live in the same state, but not anymore. They both moved 600 miles away back to our original hometown area.

Whenever I talk to him, he constantly bitches about having to take her places, pick her up from this place, and on it goes...

I've tried to mention it before to him and her, but they both usually throw cold water on the topic. She says she is ""afraid"" to drive, ever since she was little.

When I ask my brother why doesn't she get her license, he somewhat agrees with me, but never talks to her about it..

&#x200B;

Hey maybe at this point, it is what it is.. It probably wouldn't be the best idea to stick my beak into this, but part of me is like:

""*She's almost 28! Hell I had a fear of driving when I was 16, but I got over it and once I did it a few times, I enjoyed it. Why would anyone want to be dependent on another for transportation when they are capable of driving themselves around?""*

That's what my inner voice says to myself.. Maybe that's a bit self-centered to say, I don't know..

Realistically, he should be the one to tell her this if he has a problem. Maybe deep-down inside he likes the idea of having some sort of ""power"" over her? That he is the only one who can take her places. I could understand if they lived in a city with mass transit, but they don't...

Again, maybe this really isn't my place to say anything, but why not come to Reddit and see if this would make NTA or the dreaded, YTA...","Yeah, YWBTA

Needless to say I’m not the best driver and I can be a bit reckless with my speed, used my phone for music but I’ve driven to London multiple times and haven’t had any points on my license.

Today, after discussing my drive to his place, where I skidded in 5th gear due me forgetting to change, my boyfriend had a talk with me today saying he  hates it when my attention is directed for a second and doesn’t want his friends ‘white knuckling’ in the back and to be careful driving  during the journey.

I quite frankly felt insulted that he, who doesn’t drive, felt the need to tell me to watch my driving for a 4 hours a journey that only I can drive? I got a bit pissed and said ‘I don’t care what you or what they think. It’s my car and I’ll drive how I want for 4 hours’... After that he went back to work.

"AITA for telling my best friends GF he will never propose?. 
My best friend Michael (28M) has been with his girlfriend Johanna (29F) for 11 years since highschool. I (28M) recently proposed to my fiancée Lily (26F) and we've been together for just shy of 3 years. 

Earlier this week Johanna mentioned to me and Lily at a party how she can't wait for Michael to propose to her and how she can't wait to have her fairytale wedding. 

I, admittedly, laughed and told Johanna that after 11 years together if a guy hasn't proposed to you yet he probably never will.   I was also a little shocked because up until that point I thought both Michael and Johanna were on the same page and didn't believe in marriage (I know for a fact that Michael doesn't want to tie the knot but I didn't mention that to Johanna). 

Johanna got defensive and started arguing that a lot of couples wait a long time before marriage and not everyone rushes into marriage like us. I just sort of reiterated my point that 11 years is longer than average and I wouldn't be surprised if Michael never proposes. I also told Johanna straight up if she wants a proposal in the future she should probably have a serious conversation with Michael about it. 

Well, on the uber ride back home my fiancée Lily was horrified with what I'd said to Johanna. She doesn't think it's any of my business and what I said to Johanna was rude. In my opinion I was doing Johanna a favour.  I mean someone needs to tell her the reality that Michael is unlikely to propose. I do recognize I may have created some trouble for my friend but Johanna is my friend as well and I was trying to give it to her straight. 


Am I an asshole?","YTA

Holy shit man, what the hell is it any of your fucking business. Also, that is INCREDIBLY incorrect. At 28, he is young and maybe can't afford the right ring? I know a lot of people who waited a longer amount of time than that before deciding to get married. It's not the norm, sure, but again... what is it any of your business.

So I asked him if he knew if the other guy was gay or not. This made him upset because he thought I was insinuating that he was cheating on me, or that I thought he was cheating. I hesitated and said (due to past relationships) that I couldn't help but have a smidge of doubt. I further explained that I have had friends who have dated people who have practically preached that they would never cheat and then proceeded to cheat on my friends.

"AITA for refusing to give my mom her cat back. A little background. I live 4 hours away from my parents and grandparents. I've never had a strong relationship with my family and try to avoid them as much as I can. My mom lives alone and got a cat in early April. She smokes like crazy eats like crap and has a bunch of health issues.

In early July my mom became critically ill with pneumonia and spent 2 months in the ICU and then another 3 weeks in rehab recovering. During that time I took her cat back to my home with me and took care of her. I drove to see my mom in the hospital/rehab center every weekend or every other weekend for the whole summer. She got released from the rehab center at the end of September and she told me not to bring her cat back because it would be too overwhelming for her first day back at home. So I came back to see her when she got released. I was the only one of my siblings to come back, my dad was busy at work, and my grandparents didn't come by to see her at all. I was the only one there that whole weekend she was released, and let me tell ya she was not ready to be released. She could barely walk, she couldn't shower by herself, she couldn't get off the toilet by herself, get out of bed on her own, it was a disaster. I bought her a bunch of rehab equipment and installed it all for her, bought her groceries, cooked her meals for the week, took care of her, cleaned up after her when she couldn't make it to the bathroom, etc. And she treated me like absolute shit the entire time. She constantly yelled at me, never said thank you, absolutely no ounce of gratitude for taking care of her or her cat the whole summer. Whenever I was getting ready to leave to go back to my home she wouldn't even hug me goodbye or tell me she loved me.

So I left and called her mom and told her that I thought she needed to be in the rehab center another 2 weeks and that I was really worried about her living alone in her current state. This caused a bad fight between my mom and grandparents. My grandma called me and yelled at me. Then my dad called me to tell me how I was a bad son and how he was disappointed in me. Then my mom texted me and only said ""you suck""

At this point I just couldn't take it anymore. I did everything I could to be a good son and everyone in my family was treating me like garbage. I stopped vising my family after that and hardly spoke to them at all. Now my mom texted me said that she is doing fine living on her own, that she is sorry for the fight (in one of the most insincere apologies I have ever received), and she wants her cat back.

"AITA for not completely doing the dishes?. To start - I am 19F who definitely doesn't help around the house as much as I should. I know I'm lazy sometimes but I do occasionally get massive surges of energy and clean lots. I find it hard to do jobs or work due to depression (motivation and ability to concentrate is unfortunately shot atm). This has ruined a lot for me as I went from being a top student to bottom and I have struggled since with not being one of 'the best' like my mum in particular has always pushed me to be. She is pretty onboard with my bad mental health though.

Today we had an amazing Sunday roast and I helped clean and set the table. I also cleared all the dishes and did a couple loads of clothes washing. My parents asked me this evening to do the dishwasher, which I thought was slightly unfair because my brother (17) hasn't done any household chores today.  
Anyway I unloaded the dishwasher but decided I wanted to ask my brother to load it back up. This is because I am vegetarian and honestly the thought of touching plates and trays which pork has been cooked in, and are covered in fat and grease is revolting to me. I am also the only vegetarian out of the 4 of us if this is relevant at all.

My parents really did not like this even though I explained I did not want to touch all the fat and grease left over from the pork. They shook their heads at me and gave me their disappointed glare that I hate and told me how lazy I was. Mum would barely look at me. In about an hour I expect she will come into my room and tell me how awful I am for not completing the dishwasher and lecture me on my laziness.

So my question is - does she have a right to be this angry?

I think it's adorable as she wiggles her butt to make me laugh or zooms  up and down the hallway.

After telling her to put on her pants she ignored him and kept running. Then he told her something like ""that's nasty; you need to wear pants.""

My husband says I shouldn't contradict him in front of her. I explained that he should tell her it's too cold to be without pants or it's unhygienic at the dinner table, but not to use the word ""nasty"" as I don't want her to feel shame about her body.

So was I wrong to react how I did? 

&#x200B;","Very light YTA to NAH. My thought is, if you were able to explain to your daughter that it was unsafe to eat dinner without clothes, you could've also explained that's it's nasty as in unhygienic to eat without clothes.

They were both on holiday during my birthday, but they’re not now, and haven’t been for a little while. One of them managed to come online during my birthday, but said they forgot about it. They never said they’d make it up to me. The other one didn’t say anything then, but later said they’d do something for me; that was around 15 days ago.

"AITA for getting mad at my GF for being distracted all the time?. &#x200B;

Throwaway because my GF knows my main reddit

I've been with my GF for almost 2 years, and I really love this girl. I can seriously imagine myself proposing soon if it weren't for her ADHD..

I moved in with my GF 6 months ago and honestly she's been getting on my fucking nerves the entire time. Everything is fine the sex is great (kind of), we communicate well, we like the same things. But she just gets distracted so much, I'm reconsidering if she's capable of being a wife or the mother of my future children. Here are some examples: 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*  She takes way too long to clean the apartment when it's her turn to clean up. The apartment we have is pretty small and it can take up to 2-4 hours for her to clean up, because she constantly gets distracted. While it only takes me up to an hour and a half. Even then she misses things, for example she forgets to turn on the dishwasher at night, or she forgets to scrub down the counter. It wouldn't bother me so much if this were a once or twice scenario, but this happens every time.
* She spaces out when I'm talking to her, and forgets to do things I ask her a lot. Like a few nights ago I called her from work and mentioned if she could put a few of my beers in the fridge so by the time I come home they were cold. When I come home, guess what? No beer in the fridge.
* She talks to much, and about nothing. Everytime when we both come home from work she somehow is able to babble about her day for an hour straight, even if her day was pretty boring. She still for some reason thinks I want to know all the details about it.

&#x200B;

And the list goes on, this is just a few of the things she does. I usually never point it out but I got tired of it after her most recent ""mistake"" and told her: ""Look I understand that you have issues with concentration and memory but you really need to learn how to get some more self-control"". She told me that she's trying to get her ADHD under control, but it's been dificult for her. Honestly it really bothered me how she used her ADHD as an excuse, and I told her that and she seemed really upset and hasn't talked to me much recently. I feel bad but at the same time I don't think its fair that she gets to blame her ADHD when they're are so many successful people in the world with ADHD. My brother has ADHD and he has a sucessful career, and I never had issues with him when he was my roomate. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: My GF uses her ADHD as an excuse for being clumsy with her chores and being annoying, I told her this and she's upset. AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;","YTA

**Edit for anyone who doesnt read through comments: The girlfriend isn't on medication bc OP threatened her with leaving bc he doesn't want to be with a ""drug addict.""**

You can be annoyed at the symptoms of her 
ADHD, but it isn't fair to your girlfriend for you to hold her illness against her and accuse her of making excuses.  I'm sure she is upset with herself for making these mistakes and is embarrased about it.  Mental health isn't a one size fits all. Some people experience a downslide every now and then, and that is completely okay. Her medication may need adjusted or something like that.

 If this is just a fundamental part of who she is and she's been getting on your nerves for the entire time you have lived together...it might not be a good fit, which is neither of your faults. ",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for not wanting to put a stop to my son’s Spider-Man obsession?. Edit: I realize the title and post do not match! It should be 

AITA for wanting to put a stop to my son’s Spider-Man obsession? 

I have a 6 ( almost 7) year old son who is obsessed with Spider-Man. He’s been like this for a few years but It becomes more intense over time.  I can’t remember the last time he wore something that didn’t have at least one thing Spider-Man related whether it was a Spider-Man hat, Spider-Man shirt, wearing a spider man costume under his clothes or literally just wearing a Spider-Man costume. As soon as he gets home from school he changes into his Spider-Man PJs. Even when we’re going to a formal event he’ll insist on wear a Spider-Man shirt underneath his clothes. It’s a little ridiculous. He is constantly watching Spider-Man movies or cartoons. 

It’s gotten to the point where he literally acts like he’s Spider-Man. He will constantly climb onto things and do the Spider-Man hand motion and sometimes yell out “I’m spider-man” We went to China for a trip recently and quite a few locals wanted to take pictures with him. Apparently it’s because he has very blonde hair which Chinese people aren’t used to and he is “cute” but my son was convinced it was because they thought he was Spider-Man. 

I understand he’s just a kid but I think he’s getting a little old for this and think we should discourage it. I work full time and my wife is home with him much more and she thinks it’s just adorable and I feel she has been actively encouraging this by buying him so many Spider-Man related things and allowing him to dress up in his spider-man clothes constantly. If I ever try and refuse to let our son wear them  she thinks I’m being mean and tells him it’s fine. She thinks I’m being an asshole and acting so worked up about something so innocent and that he’ll grow out of it. But my logic is if we keep encouraging this obsession, how will he grow out of it? I feel he’s going to start to get teased for this soon and that we should put a stop to it now. 

AITA here?","YTA, have you met any six year olds? I wanted to be a cat at that age, only acted out cat books, and tried to wear cat ears to school. Guess who doesn’t do that anymore? Just let him be a weird little blonde spiderman, he’s hurting nobody including himself.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for walking out on my friend for playing the peacekeeper. For starters, we are not judging the stupidity of the original fight. I concede it was a stupid fight and has even been changed to an even more irrelevant topic. I am on mobile.

My friend was getting ready for us to go out shopping.  While waiting her husband, her and I we're discussing various things. The topic of a track tournament came up. I stated how disappointed I was with the outcome, the husband agreed stating that he had been hopeful for someone that had lost early in the tournament. I agreed in my disappointment in their early loss. 

He then said that at least the person who came in second wasn't the winner. I also agreed that I did not think they were the best and was glad they did not win. Then he said something that blew up my brain. He said that the contest was only between those two runners and if he couldn't have his early pick, then the runner that won was the best he could hope for. 

What blew my brain, was that there were 4 runners in the race, not 2. When I tried to remind him there were two other runners, one that I even preferred over the first and second place winners he said since he didn't know them they didn't count. I called bullshit and he said the guy that lost early in the tournament was the only one that mattered after that one and two because he knew their names. When I started to tell him him not knowing their names didn't matter, he stormed out.

Did you make it this far?Here's where I actually want to know if I'm the asshole.

"AITA for being disappointed with Christmas last year?. My (18F) parents have always been champs at christmas but 2017 was the year I was officially an adult and my sister was out of the country for Christmas for the first time. I believed in Santa longer than the average child but when they knew that I knew he wasn’t real they still made an effort to make it seem like he was purely because that’s how it’s always been and how I like it.

I’m disappointed not only because they broke that tradition last year, but they didn’t seem to make any effort at all with gifts. Since my sister wasn’t there I did all the work and made Christmas menus and got them double the amount of presents despite being mentally ill and having a tough time.

Santa got them each a present but none for me. What they got me were pretty disappointing as well. For example, I got two dresses. I’d bought one like a week beforehand because I needed one but I never wear them unless I absolutely have too. They also got me a pair of sunglasses which make me look like a freaking alien. They know I always go for a certain style and that was definitely not it. They got me the game Battleship despite the fact I hate board games. I also wanted band merch and specifically told them which one I wanted but they got me a different one because they liked it more.

Idk I really try to enjoy my gifts and try new things. I played battleship but got bored, I’ve worn my dresses out and my sunglasses but have been EXTREMELY uncomfortable. I know they have good intentions but if I try to say they’re not me they get offended and call me ungrateful. 

Am I the asshole here for being disappointed with the break in tradition and shitty presents?



TL;DR: Struggling to enjoy my unusual Christmas presents and getting blamed when I hint towards not liking them","I don’t think you’re an asshole for feeling disappointed, but rather that your attitude about it makes you an asshole. You’re 18. You’re way too old to be upset that you didn’t get presents from Santa.

Sometimes gifts miss the mark and while that’s disappointing, gifts aren’t always going to be exactly what you asked for. For example, your comment about the band merch - you asked for something particular, and they got you something *they* wanted to get for you instead. They probably thought you’d like because it was similar, or maybe (as parents often do) they couldn’t remember the exact thing you wanted and thought they got it right.

Maybe they got you dresses because you rarely wear them and they thought you didn’t have many/any. Maybe they thought you’d want some more grown up clothes.

It may have been difficult for your parents to pick out gifts for you because like you said, you’re now an adult. Hence the sunglasses and board game.

Have you even considered that your parents might have found it difficult to have Christmas without your sister there? I know when my brother moved out of state to join the army, our first Christmas without him was pretty low key and kind of sad. Maybe that’s why your parents weren’t emotionally able to host Christmas in a way that was up to your standards.

Judging by your wording in your post, I can imagine the tone and phrasing you probably used when you told your parents you didn’t like your gifts, and I totally agree that you’re ungrateful. “They didn’t seem to make any effort at all with gifts”? They got you FIVE. You know how many my parents and I exchange every year? One.

"AITA for chewing out a friend after they sent a photo saying they were close to death?. Tl;dr at the bottom

I (30) have known my friend (30, I’ll call them R) for about 4 years. Pretty much the entire month of July R has been sick with pneumonia. Wednesday R called off work due to being so sick. That previous weekend, R felt better one day and decided to walk around in 95 degree weather all day and ended up relapsing. At one point on Wednesday, R sent me a message looking extremely unwell and stated that death was soon. R has had severe depression for a while so I’m a bit more sensitive to comments like that from them. After R sent that I message I quickly responded back asking how they were doing. It took R 45 minutes to respond and over 30 minutes to even look at my message. After of 20 minutes of nothing, I said that they should immediately get some help. At the 30 minute mark, I was pretty pissed and told R that doing this kind of stuff is extremely rude and inconsiderate and the ugliest thing they have ever done to me. 

When R finally responded, they said that they were sorry and that they didn’t mean it like that. For me, it doesn’t matter how they meant it. Death is a touchy subject for me currently (my dad is battling stage 4 cancer and R is aware of that fact) so being dramatic about it isn’t going to go over well. If they were serious, then they would have sent a horrible picture of themselves and that very well could have been the last image of them I had and not even given an opportunity to talk to them. 

So AITA for how I reacted? I understand the need to be sensitive about people with depression, but I also feel that being upfront with them and honest with how their actions made me feel is important as well.","I get where you're coming from, but YTA. I get why you'd be extra sensitive to comments about death right now, but it's very common for people to be dramatic and say that something is going to kill them when that thing is unpleasant but survivable. It's understandable if you don't want people to make those jokes around you, but you have to *tell* people that. R didn't say they were dying and then stop responding for a bit to scare you, they just thought it was obvious that they were joking and didn't realize how badly it would affect you.

"AITA for being upset that my siblings are getting part of an inheritance but I’m not because I’m a recovering addict?. My parents are pretty wealthy. 

I’m 26 and from 21-25 I was in and out of rehabs. I was abusing so many different kinds of drugs and I wasted so much money. I OD’d once  and it destroyed my family to watch me go through that. 

I am intensely ashamed of who I was as a person and I have been sober for almost a year. 

My parents are now approaching their late 60s and have started finalizing their wills and inheritance. 

Yesterday they sat me down and told me that I will not be getting any of the inheritance as they don’t trust me not to relapse with all that money suddenly in my possession and as a result my siblings will be getting my share of the money. 

I was pretty upset about this and I said that they were going to make my siblings rich while I would get nothing from it and that wasn’t fair. I was almost yelling at this point. 

They told me to calm down but I was too upset to listen and I left. I called my brother and sister after I left and told them what my parents said and they said that it was their choice and there wasn’t anything they could do. 

I accused them of just wanted all the money for themselves and not caring about what happened to me. 

Today I have my dad texting me that they are worried about me and “disappointed in my behaviour yesterday.” I talked to my sponsor and he said that while anger is understandable, I have to do everything in my power not to ruin the trust I’ve built with my family over the past year and acting like an asshole addict won’t help. 
Sometimes I still have trouble with my reactions to things now that I’m sober however I don’t feel as though I’m entirely unjustified here.

"AITA for showing my displeasure at being pressured to move to a different seat at a restaurant?. One of my favorite things to do to get it out of the house, is to grab a notepad for writing, my phone for redditing, and post up at one of the many popular diners here in town. I stay awhile, do some creative writing, enjoy some people watching, and tip generously.

There was way more people there than usual on this particular day. With a line out of the door, the wait was going to be 45 minutes easy.

When I asked for a table for one, the host politely requested I take a seat at the bar. The bar is not a great here as there's only 5 seats and you're crammed with the staff. There was one seat available in the middle, with two guys to the left and two girls to the right. I figured if I take up a whole table to myself, that's kinda rude to the people coming up behind me, so I concede and take the middle seat at the bar.

About 10 minutes in, I'm enjoying my coffee, doing some writing, and doing well to not get too distracted. Until I noticed a guy standing over my left shoulder, between myself and the other two guys at the bar. He's hovering pretty strongly. One of the guys to my left gets his bill and as he's about to pay, I hear this hovering guy say on his phone, ""Yeah, there's three spots at the bar. I'm about to get them."" I'm thinking to myself, ""Oh, he sees I don’t have any food and thinks I’m about to leave.""

So, I turn to him and say, ""I'm going to be awhile, I'm not leaving soon."" He's confused, the he motions to the girls to my right and the one on the far right was now about to start paying for her meal. He then speaks, addressing me and the girl immediately to my right who isn't finished with her meal, ""Y’all can move down one, right?""

What he doesn't know is that the two girls came together and he misjudged that I was alone.  The girl to my right gave a weird look and nothing was said as a follow-up.  I just went back to my coffee and writing, trying to block him out. I'm thinking he'll just go back to the host and get on the waiting list now.

Well, 10 or 15 minutes later, I'm starting to wind down. The guy has taken the two seats to my left and the girls to my right have just left. It takes me a minute or two to realize that the new guy who showed up to take the seat to my right was the third guy in their group. All of the conversation stops between them and they are all staring at me. I'm starting to get pissed now and once again, Hover Man chimes in, ""You can move down now, right?""

At this point I'm feeling like I'm going to go full Larry David on this whole situation, but I bite my tongue, make it clear in my attitude that I'm pissed off at the situation, and move to my right.

It's obvious that they believed I was the asshole for not conceding to whatever game of musical chairs they needed me to do so that their group of three could sit together at this 5 -seat bar. And here I am thinking they’re assholes, for saving seats and pressuring someone to move from their seat instead of waiting to get a table like everyone else.

What say you?","YTA. Moving down a seat at the bar is such a minor inconvenience, most people would reasonably expect you to do it to accommodate a larger group.

"AITA for hating my bother-in-law who is ruining our marriage?. Throwaway account obviously... English is not my first language bear with me.

Am I (33F) the asshole for getting angry at my husband (30M) because his brother (40’s M) is using our washer and dryer without asking?

Backstory, I’ve know my brother in-law since I was 15 years old, he’s the reason I am married to his brother. We were never friends, we just knew each other. Once married, we moved cross country to another state. Everything was going great until his deadbeat brother moved in with us for 3 months to get clean. He did pretty good, got a job but he always had a sense of entitlement around the house. After the 3 months of sponsoring him, we took him back home, and 6 months later BOOM back to his old habits and his mom sends him back to us. After 3 months of misery, and having fights with my husband every week, I told we could NOT have him in the house again. He returns, and got a room in someone’s house (Airbnb). It’s been almost a year, he’s got a great job and he’s been good.

He’s not my favorite person in the world due to his personality and how he’s been playing his family for money and such, but I still try to get along with him. In may of this year, I invited him for a cookout, he gets in the car with a bag of clothes… my husband was also confused and he asked his if he was going to stay with us, and he just responded, “no, I’m doing laundry” I just stayed quiet, I was baffled. I was doing laundry that day (I always do on Sundays), and so I never took the clothes out of the washer. One because I didn’t want him to use my machines, and two I was busy doing the cooking and all. He didn’t even asked to use the washer. My husband takes him home and I am livid, he doesn’t live with us any more, he can’t be puling that shit of entitlement, he responds “I would’ve done the same” I know he wouldn’t because he is the educated one, my husband has manners! I told him I just wanted for him to ask, that is all.

Fast forward a few months, my husband tells me, “Oh my brother invited his family over (wife and two kids) to come visit him.” This dirt bag is renting a room, and he invites his family to visit him… can you guess where the family stayed? Yeah… our house.

Last weekend, we went out on a day trip and we were going to return a bit late, and my husband tells me if he can tell his brother to come over to our house to feed the dogs while were out, I though sure. We get home, and the asshole is taking a nap in your guess room, while the dryer is going off. I lost it again, he never asked to use it, at least not to me, and I am pretty sure he did not ask my husband either, but I don’t know because it been 2 days and I haven’t talked to my husband since. Because he said he was not going to talk about it because we already and talked about this before, and that I should respect his brother from coming to do laundry instead of him respecting my home.","YTA: I'm sure most would disagree with me, but this isn't your brother in law's fault if it's ruining your relationship... It's you and your husband's, because you two clearly are having issues communicating with each other. You two haven't talked in two days over an issue with *laundry*? There's clearly something deeper here.

His brother received permission to do laundry from your husband. Unless you are 100% sole owner of that home, and you do not want your husband to consider this his home as well, then your husband gets to give permission to his brother... Your husband lives there as well. It's home as well.

For Valentine’s Day, everyone brings in some snacks to kind of celebrate the day. Usually stuff like brownies or cookies. I thought it would be funny to get the bean boozle jelly belly beans as a prank since basically everyone was bring something. I bought a few boxes of the beans and spent an hour or so picking through them and tasting which beans were regular and which were the nasty ones. Definitely wasted a lot of the nasty ones but oh well lol. They weren’t that bad, so I didn’t think anyone would react the way they did. 

I wrapped up around 20 jelly beans per person in Valentine’s Day plastic bags. There’s 9 people in my office. Valentine’s Day comes and I pass them out while work is slow and everyone came to the break room to snack on everything else there was. I told everyone happy Valentine’s day, that I appreciate them, and to enjoy the jelly beans. I saw a few people eat the beans and made weird faces which I thought was hilarious, and then they put them down lol. Eventually everybody was eating them around the same time. One worker came up to me and said he thought it was the funniest thing ever. Then, another worker that was sitting at a table says “what the fuck is this, throwawayquestions220?” 

I was honestly shocked, not only because of the attitude but because he cursed at me over a joke.. Next thing I know, three more people are complaining. A few people were laughing and some didn’t care, but it seemed like the majority of the break room was mad at me. I told everyone it isn’t a big deal while laughing, and I got a lot of stank faces and scoffs. After a few minutes everyone cleared out except the guy who was laughing with me. 

Now a few days have passed and people are acting resentful towards me. Not really engaging in friendly conversation, only work related bullshit. One worker keeps bringing it up and complaining, it’s been so annoying. I’ve thought about transferring him because he’s been such a downer about it.

"AITA for cutting off my child's internet access because he broke a term in our ""contract""?. So my child just entered high-school, and now requires a PC for school work. I bought my child a fairly nice PC, so my child can continue using this PC even in university and ultimately saves money in the long run.

I'm fully aware that with the new access to computers/internet, there would be inevitable distractions like gaming etc, so I laid some ground rules.

1. My child may only play games 30 minutes everyday, weekends is 1 hour per day.
2. My child may only play games **after** my child has completed my child's daily tasks (incl doing homework etc).
3. In addition, my child have free time **after** my child has completed the daily tasks until my child sleeps. However, during this free time, my child may only play 30 minutes of videogames (refer back to rule 1), the rest of the free time my child must do something other than videogames.

I also told my child that, if my child breaks any of these rules, I may cut off my child's internet access or take away my child's PC, depending on the severity of the offence, and whether it is first-time or repeated offence.

Just to make it official, we even made a contract and signed it.

To no one's surprise, I caught my child playing videogames when my child was supposed to be doing homework. Punishment? No internet for a week. If my child requires internet for school, my child will need to use my computer, and under my supervision.

My wife told me that my punishment is too harsh, and ""children will be children"". She feel like since this is a first offence, only warning will be suffice. My argument is that, I had made it absolutely clear of the punishments etc when I first bought my child the PC. Also, one week no internet is hardly that bad.

AITA?



So instead, I'm replacing my child's PC with a cheap chromebook, enough for school. This way, my child can't play games anyways and I don't have to monitor my child, which is taking a toll on me as well.","YTA

"AITA for holding a grudge against my sister because of her daughter?. A few months ago, my older sister opened up her home to me (I'm an adult in my late-twenties) due to a bad housing situation (see update below). I took over her older daughter's bedroom (she's 9 - but she sleeps with her little sister, anyway, so it's pretty much a vacant/storage room). But anyway, most recently, her younger, 7-year old daughter has taken a liking to telling me I ""don't live here at this home"" and that ""this isn't your home."" It all started because she doesn't have clear sense of boundaries, so when I was studying for an interview, asked her to leave the room (she barges in whenever she wants, refuses to leave, etc.). When I told my sister, who subsequently talked to her, my niece said one of her schoolmates dared her to say it to me (which absolutely makes no sense). Regardless, my sister apologized, but blame it on said schoolmate.

Well, it's not stopping - my niece has since ""dared"" my nephew to tell me I don't belong here and that this isn't my home. I've talked to my sister, and my niece blamed it on the fact that I was ""bugging"" her while she was playing. These were at different times in the day, not at all an excuse. My sister once again dismissed it and said she was ""probably joking.""

I'm holding a bit of a grudge/frustration, and I acknowledge it's petty considering the child is seven. But she's taken no action or steps in reprimanding her daughter whatsoever.

Also, a side note as it seems to be pretty important/a common theme in the comments: aside from the frustration, I do not treat her or the rest of the family maliciously. I set aside 'playtime' with them, bond with them, read with them, etc. Several of the comments paint the picture of an ungrateful, unemployed adult milking off her older sister when that is nowhere close to who I am as a sister or an aunt.

Hey, everyone. So didn’t really think this post would pick up like this. I wanted to get a few words in before this post stops picking up traction.

Thanks to everyone giving me their honest opinion. I do and fully recognize that she’s a 7-year-old baby, and my sister is doing me a tremendous favor by letting me crash with her for the time being.

For anyone who has called me lazy, pathetic, sad, etc. Please understand that I am also **HUMAN**. I had to crash with her because I was moved back home to be with my ill dad (cancer), and for whatever reason our house was targeted in a shooting and I was almost hit.

So not having a place to stay, feeling lost and confused while also managing a full-time overwhelming job has taken a toll. And hearing you don’t belong here when I did not, in fact, have a place to stay was disheartening. But again, a child.

That is all. Doesn’t change things, but this post helped me get out of my bubble and realize she’s a child.","YTA

"AITA for not sharing?. Today I was hungry so I went to make myself a PB&J. I hadn't even fully twisted off the lid before she came running into the room.

The look of betrayal on her sweet face is making think I might have ducked up. After I finished the sandwich (been a few hours) she won't even look at me.

"AITA for kicking my employee out of the office?. I am an Office Manager at a tax firm. We had to work today, but very few people showed up (they took vacation). Our boss said we could leave as early as 2PM and all but one person took him up on his offer. His name is Eric and he is an older gay guy. I don't think he has family or any friends and he spoke about breaking up with his boyfriend a couple of years ago. Nice guy, hard worker, quiet yet obviously lonely. I told Eric he should just leave and whatever work he had could wait until Monday (which is 100% true and he's ahead on his work). He declined and made up excuse after excuse as to why he needed to stay.

Sometimes he comes in at 8AM and doesn't leave until 7PM even though his work schedule is 8:30AM to 5:30PM. He doesn't ask for OT. My boss started to grow concern about his working so late because he thinks he's overworked and suggested that I take on some of Eric's work. That's not the case at ALL. He just doesn't have a life outside of work. He's one of those people. I know my boss would find out that he stayed late, AGAIN and on a semi-holiday, and that would result in my having to take on his work. I told Eric that I wasn't trying to be rude and knew he was working, but he had to leave - boss's orders. He made a comment how it felt weird leaving work while there was still light and didn't know what to do. I told him to go feed some homeless people.","YTA

"AITA for going camping without my girlfriend. Throwaway because my gf follows me on Reddit.

My gf (26F) and I (25F) met about two and half years ago and started dating very soon after. We were both in grad school (law for me, social work for her) at the time, and were both working to pay for school.

For the nearly two years we were in school, we talked all the time about how we both loved hiking and camping and couldn’t wait to do it together when we had more spare time (as we virtually never had a mutual weekend free while we were in school). 

We both finished our programs in May and are fortunate to both have challenging but reasonable jobs where we generally have weekends free and are able to take generous vacation days. As a result, we now have spare time to go camping and hiking like we had always talked about! However, it has very quickly become apparent that we have extremely different ideas of an ideal camping trip:

Hers: pack what we need to be comfortable, hike a couple miles, preferably in a place with gorgeous views or cool water features (waterfalls and whatnot)

Mine: pack as light as humanly possible, hike for 8-10 hours covering as much distance as possible, and generally avoid hikes with popular attractions because they tend to have a lot of people on them

I fully admit that I probably should have seen this coming. I have a good 8 inches and probably like 50 pounds on her. I work out most days of the week; she is one of those naturally very slim people who hates working out. I also just tend to do things/want to do things that she thinks are ridiculous, like sleeping in the car on vacation to save money or leaving the heat off during the winter. It’s all good; different strokes for different folks.

Anyway, we went camping a couple weekends ago. I had a nice time because I love her and like spending time with her, but ultimately I finished the trip not feeling like I had camped so much as gone on vacation. To be clear, I don’t *dislike* this kind of camping; it just doesn’t quite scratch the itch for me to get out and go the distance.

I decided to plan my own camping trip by myself. The truth is that my gf was totally wiped out from the trip we just did, and I think it would be unpleasant for all involved to try to bring her on this trip. When I mentioned it to her, she wasn’t mad at all, but got extremely apologetic and self conscious. She kept saying that she was so sorry she disappointed me and that we couldn’t do these fun things together.  She was crying and upset and just seemed so sad about the whole thing. I tried to be reassuring, but it didn’t seem to help much. I now feel like a massive dick for planning this trip, but also don’t feel like I should really have to give up a hobby that I love. AITA?",YTA for how you handled it. Why didn’t you discuss with your girlfriend how you enjoyed the trip but it didn’t quite“satisfy” your camping wants. And ask if next time she would be willing to try your way. Or to compromise. Instead you planned a trip without telling her. Upon finding out I’m sure she felt that you HATED the camping trip with her. I would be embarrassed and self conscious too.,1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for destroying a photo of myself in my grandma's house.. I once sent a photo of myself to my dad on the first day of moving abroad, sort of as a ""look, got here safe!"". It being the first day, I'm really jetlagged and look like shit, with that nasty grey tone to your skin when youve not had enough sleep. Add to that my hair is greasy, I'm not wearing a bra, and it's a really unflattering angle on my nose. Despite all this he printed it and framed it for my grandma. I really hate this picture and wish I'd never taken it. I never would have sent it if I'd realised it WOULDN'T be just some throwaway. 

When I moved back home and saw it framed and up I was so pissed off and upset. I begged them both to get rid of it and offered to find another picture for the frame if she really wanted it. It's the only picture of me over the age of 10 and it's not because other pictures don't exist. I really liked my graduation photos and they are nowhere to be seen in her house or anyone else's in my family. I occasionally send my dad pictures of me and schoolfriends, or me and my partner at events and noone seems interested. Just this horrible ugly picture of me that makes me feel sick.it's been there for about 5 years and I shudder whenever I see it. Everyone told me not to be silly. But if it was so trivial, why couldnt it just go?

I left intensive eating disorder treatment earlier this year and decided I would try and eliminate things that made me feel shit from my life as far as possible. Two weeks ago I discreetly removed the picture from its frame and left a note ""IOU A NICER PICTURE OF METO REPLACE THIS"". I destroyed the photo. She just discovered this two nights ago and is, together with my dad, really angry and saying I've crossed a line.

AITA? I found it borderline oppressive and noone even listened to my concerns, let alone took them seriously.

","I mean... such a non-issue for all parties involved here. I dunno. I mean, you tip the scales here in asshole territory. They liked that photo of you man! Why you gotta rip shit up when all it's there for is to be loved? They love you dude. Greasy hair, no bra, and all. 

Think about the people looking at it. It's just You and Grandma. The other people at Grandma's house... they aren't looking at it. Even if they're looking at it, they aren't looking at it. Nobody gives even a quarter shit about your braless grease picture. 

You're also an ass for not IMMEDIATELY replacing this picture. you don't pull some Metal Gear spy ninja stealth move like that and then wait more than two weeks. You owe that photo right away. Like... Right Now. Stop what you're doing and get some selfies going (First, of course, take some time to take a shower and put on a bra this time just to avoid a repeat situation). 

Your Gran and Pops however should have respected your wish to take the photo down. You're still losing in asshole points, but they def got some. ",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for telling my sister to not practice playing the guitar during my visit?. It was my sister‘s birthday last Friday. Both my sisters and their boyfriends live in the same city, which is about an hour and a half drive away from me. They invited me and my s/o to stay the night at their place which we happily agreed to.


Growing up our parents never encouraged us to learn any instruments and were even lightly annoyed that we were a little too into arts for their taste. They’d preferred we focus on school.


Later on we all regret never having taken the opportunity for artistic development. I knew she wants to start learning an instrument now but it can be quite expensive. I heard from her boyfriend that she wants to learn to play the guitar so I decided to get her a beginner friendly one(s/o chimed in).


Needless to say she was ecstatic when she opened the present and it made me really happy. It was quite late into the night but she decided to look up some YouTube tutorials and practiced right there and then. Which was fine, she goofed around and had fun.


However the next day she’d use every free minute to practice. I was using my phone in the same room (hers), my other sister and her boyfriend were in their room and my s/o already left, the kitchen offers no space to hang out so I was stuck in her room. After about an hour it really got on my nerves. She was so into it she didn’t really notice how unnerving it got. She practiced the few same notes, the few same moves again and again, sometimes stopped to rewind the tutorial and went at it again. At some point I asked, after much consideration and in a polite tone, „Hey, can you postpone the practice session to a later point? It’s kinda getting on my nerves.“ She thought I was joking and ignored my request. I let her play for another 10 minutes and repeated my question. She ignored me again without a word. After 5 more minutes I raised my volume to make sure she can hear me „Hey, I wasn’t joking. Please stop for now, you can resume later in 3 hours after I have left!“


She got a little upset, mostly sad and countered disappointedly „If you hate it, why did you give it to me?“ and put the guitar away. I instantly felt bad because I have a really soft spot for my sisters. I said I‘d be glad to hear her play once she is confident with her skills but for now it was kind of annoying me. She looked so sad I caved and said that if she really wanted to, she could continue, I’d go for a walk or something. She said „no“ quietly and put the guitar away.


There were absolutely no hard feelings, her mood picked up half an hour later. I’ve been known to be a little tough, borderline asshole-ish (verbally) sometimes, I’ve tried hard for about 3 years now to be more considerate so I wonder if this was one of the situations where I should have held my tongue. AITA?","YTA.  You are a guest in her home.  You gave her the guitar.  you would be leaving soon enough.  Your SO showed by example the polite response: leave the room.  Go for a walk, sit outside.

"WIBTA for using a holiday I don't celebrate as an excuse to get out of work?. I was raised to be non-secular by a parents with different religions. I only fast for Ramadan if I remember that it's starting before it starts.

I am the lowest-level manager at a store. The other managers are Frank (head manager) and Maria.

Managers usually work the opening shift (9-5:30) or the closing shift (1:30-10). During Ramadan, I didn't work past 7pm. As a result, Frank and Maria had to close the store a lot, which is worse than opening. I didn't fast all the days I said I would because I was on my period for 2 weeks. I got the impression that Frank was suspicious about how often I was not fasting and slightly resentful that he had to close the store so often.

Cut to a few weeks ago. Frank brought up that another Muslim holiday (Eid) is approaching. I told him I planned to ask for that day off. But I didn't tell him I have never celebrated Eid. I didn't want him to think I lied about Ramadan. Taking 1 day off seemed harmless. Eid falls on Sunday, 8/11 this year. 

Technically, we are supposed to request time off at least 2 weeks in advance using a website. I didn't do that for Eid out of spite. Frank gets mad when people don't follow procedure for this, but he also never checks the website to see if people have asked for time off, and he doesn't follow procedure for making our schedules. He's supposed to post new schedules at least 2 weeks in advance. He usually posts them 2-3 days before they start.

Cut to last week.A coworker texted Frank to ask for 8/10 off. She'd bought expensive tickets for that day. Frank told her no because 8/10 is tax-free weekend, which is similar to Black Friday. She quit on the spot. He was pissed.

This happened on the penultimate day of the 2 week period to ask for 8/11 off. So technically I did know it was tax-free weekend in time to ask for the day off, but I was afraid to ask at that point because I knew Frank was mad. I texted Maria about this and she agreed asking him that weekend was a bad idea.

I know being understaffed for Black Friday would suck for everyone, not just Frank. So I switched gears and decided to work 8/10, but not say anything. Ideally, I would work that day, Frank would learn it was a holiday later, and I would play the martyr for having worked that day without complaint and score some good-employee points.

BUT THEN a former employee (Selwa) was rehired. She's muslim and we bond over this. She texted the group chat to mention that 8/10 is Eid. So now I feel like I have to take that time off, lest Frank think I was faking Ramadan and lying to him before. Also, I don't want Selwa to know what a lazy ""muslim"" I am.

Idk who else would not be working that day because Frank doesn't share their availability with me. It's possible we'd be fully staffed without me. I have never worked tax-free weekend, so Idk if it's truly as bad as Black Friday.

**TL;DR—WIBTA for possibly leaving my store understaffed on tax-free weekend so that my boss doesn't think I lied to him?**

**Edit to add:** In the 6 months that Frank has been our boss, I have never asked for any days off. Meanwhile, Frank and Maria have both taken 2 separate week-long vacations (forcing the other two managers to work every day that they were gone.)

"AITA If I refuse to go to my daughter’s engagement party?. My daughter has apparently been dating someone since her senior year of high school until now. (7 years). Apparently, literally everyone in the family knew except for me. I only realized when an invitation to their engagement party came into the mail.

In the past, I must admit that I have been against any of my children entering relationships in high school, because I wanted them to focus on their education. It was always more of a “You can date someone after you graduate” mentality, and that was made clear to my children.

"AITA for telling my sister that she has it easy after I couldn’t take her constant bitching anymore?. I (22M) have a sister (24F). We have a pretty good relationship. She came over to my place last night and we cooked dinner together. We have done that quite often since I moved close to her. One thing I don’t like about her is her constant bitching about inconsequential matters. I have always just listened to her bitching because I know she just needs an ear, but today I had enough. While we were cooking, she bitched about the following things. Most of them are recurring complaints. She said her hair is so damaged because she has to get her hair bleached and dyed all the time since she’s a model and doesn’t get to have much control over her style. She even had the gall to bitch about her boobs killing her back even though she’s the one who wanted implants. She also bitched about the traffic on the way here. It’s LA. Traffic is a given. My breaking point was when she bitched about her boyfriend not returning her calls.


I told her she has it easy and she really needs to stop bitching and bringing everyone else around her down. She asked me why she had it easy. I told her she lucked out being born a pretty girl and never having to do anything besides posing in front of cameras and being lucky enough to snag a rich boyfriend who she can live off and never have to work again after she gets married to him. I told her she doesn’t hear me bitching even though I work a soul-sucking office job with ugly female coworkers for 60 hours a week to make pennies.


She asked me if I think it’s easy for her because she’s a woman. I told her many women have it tough, but she has it easy because she was dealt the right cards and she should really be grateful instead of complaining all the time. She said her life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows and she has to face nonstop harassment and her relationships are often skin-deep because no one can see past her outer appearance. I said she must be joking because 99% of people would trade lives with her in a heartbeat if these little things are worth complaining about. She said everyone has a right to bitch about things to relieve tension and I can bitch to her about my life to her as well. I said it’s not necessary and she should really cool it with the bitching because it makes her look like a child and kills the mood. 


She said she’ll try to bitch less, but said again she doesn’t have it easy and her life is every bit as hard as mine. She said she’s jealous of me being more than a piece of meat to most people and not having to be on guard 24/7. I told her to stop comparing and just enjoy what we have. She said I was right, but said again she doesn’t have it easy and wants me to remember that. I was done with that crap. I didn’t entertain that discussion anymore. She even bitched about the dish being too salty after we already agreed that it was perfect before turning off the stove. I rolled my eyes. Her bitching really irks me.",">I work a soul-sucking office job with ugly female coworkers

"WIBTA if I wished my mom on her birthday this year?. Would I be an asshole if I got my mom cake and wished her happy birthday this year? The thing is my father passed away on the day of her birthday 14 years ago and nothing has ever been the same. 

My mom was an only child and my grandparents always spoiled her on her birthday every single year. They would have huge parties and pretty extravagant cakes, like honestly, they were the size of a baby elephant, without exaggeration. Her birthday was always a huge deal because it was truly a day of celebration for all of us. 

However, my dad very suddenly passed away on the day of her birthday 14 years ago and ever since then, we haven’t celebrated it.

"WIBTA if I contacted my wife's therapist without her knowing?. Edit: Since it's getting confused a bunch, I just want to clarify: I'm not thinking of asking her therapist and asking her personal questions. Just calling her and saying something like ""Hi, this is Emilitia, husband of [name]. Just wanted to let you know I'm concerned about [issue] and she won't talk to me. Could you see if she'd talk to you?"" I work in a field that deals with HIPAA, I know she cant tell me anything, but I'm not asking her to.

Edit 2: Not intentionally ""disputing"" anyone's judgement (since that's against the spirit of the sub), but just curious as to how people think this means I have boundary issues or control issues? If I said ""my wife looks at her phone sometimes"", then yeah, hardcore control issues. But I say how she's looking at it all the time, ignoring her family and responsibilities, and that's the main issue? Genuinely looking for insight on that.

Throwaway because my wife knows my main account.

Tl;Dr: My wife has been seeing a therapist for a little over a year now, initially because we were having some major issues (along with her dealing with anxiety and depression), and still sees her to this day. I've been contemplating contacting her to have her perhaps see if my wife is addicted to her phone/role playing.

So, as the title and Tl;Dr suggest, my wife has been seeing a therapist. Around a year and a half ago, my wife misunderstood some thing she saw on my phone (literally one text, no other signs could be misconstrued as cheating). That, plus me having lost my job not long before, equals my wife assuming I lost my job because I was calling off all the time to cheat. We got through it, and are doing much better.

Anyway, not long after we started having issues, but before the therapist, my wife took a turn (pardon the unintentional dramatic sound of that). One of her favorite hobbies is role-playing. It used to be that she'd do it on websites like Eliteskills, and she would do all her posting at once. Well, not long after we started having issues, she picked up ""rapid role-playing"". For those who don't know, rapid role playing is the same as role play, but it's....well....rapid. Usually done in Discord, Kik, or Messenger, the role-playing proceeds at the speed of a normal conversation due to being through an instant messaging service.

However, it's a little out of control. My wife has at least 40 or so characters she plays, and I know she's always thinking of more. She's ALWAYS looking at her phone. She wakes up in the morning, checks her phone and does it little. I know she does it at work whenever it's slow (which is almost always). On the way to get our kids she's doing it. As soon as we get home, shes on the couch doing it. During dinner, going to the bathroom, taking a bath-shower (she sits down in the tub with the showerhead on. I had to bring her a towel and she was leaning over the side of the run doing it). She'll ask for a nap, and then she ends up coming back out a few minutes later because she heard her phone go off.

I've tried talking to her about it, not calling it an addiction, and she had none of it. I mean, there's periods where she won't look up from her phone for literally close to an hour, just bouncing back and forth between Discord and Messenger, replying to role plays from different people.

Normally I wouldn't think of contacting her therapist, but I mean, even talking to the kids at home, she's distracted by her phone. Talking to me, most of what she says is just noncommittal replies (alot of ""yeah"", ""oh yeah"", ""mhmm"", etc). And yeah, I've tried engaging her more, but mid-conversation she'll look at her phone and then thats it.

I just don't know what else to do. I know chances are, her therapist will either just say ""no, sorry can't help you"", or she'll talk to my wife about it and let her know I'm concerned, but yeah.

Anyway, WIBTA? Would that be a breach of privacy or whatever by going to her therapist?","YWBTA, don't contact her therapist without her knowing, just set up a group appointment.

I ended up going out with my girlfriend who I never see but one day a week and returning home at midnight with the intention of finishing cleaning up the car.

I've tried talking to him but to no avail, I've tried talking to the person who is giving him $20 to help with the payment but he didn't budge. I asked on r/relationship_advice and was told to report him to school administrators.

Is he smoking ciggerettes? I would also be concerned with his addiction to nicotine at such a young age. Does his parents know? Is there a way your parents could talk to his parents, maybe even on the pretense they snooped through your texts or something? 

If he's not smoking, you should send him the article that Juul is not for him. If there's stores that sell pods, you could ask them to not sell to your friend or this other person (if you could give them photos) for providing to minors

"AITA a little problem with “the N word”. 
I’m doing this for a friend...

    So my friend, who I’ll name Dom [M45], was driving two 15 year old boys home from hockey practice. One of the boys was his son, and the other was half an African American, and half Caucasian boy who I’ll call Tony.
 
     So during the car ride home, Tony was playing his rap music through the car speakers, and my friend Dom asked, “why does these songs say ni**er so much?”

     Then Tony got all defensive and says,” dont day that word, you can’t say that word”. 
 
        Tony and Dom argued, and Tony started to say he doesn’t respect Dom, and it was a ‘hate crime’.  Dom argues that he’s an adult, and he can say what he wants, and that he shouldn’t be treating him like one of his buddies.

          At the end of the ride, Dom told Tony that he doesn’t want to see him anymore, and he expects an apology. Tony aggressively got out of the car without saying anything. 
 

      Another very important thing to add is that Dom did everything for Tony. Tony’s father left him, and his mother is never really around either. His home life is pretty rough, he’s very poor. So Dom tried to be almost a father figure to Tony. Dom would invite him to his home before every practice and feed him. He drove him to every practice and games. He’d also let him stay with his family during tournaments. So when Tony told Dom he didn’t respect him, it understandably made him very upset, after all he has done for the kid.


   Dom feels like he did the right thing, but is he the asshole over Tony?

Sorry if this was a lot to read but I appreciate it highly.","of course YTA. do we really need to explain why actually saying the n-word to someone who's black is a 100% asshole move? it doesn't matter how well dom has treated tony in the past, he's shown his stance with regards to race and his willingness to use racist language casually. if dom had simply asked ""why do they use the n-word so much?"" that would be an excusably ignorant thing to ask, but to actually speak the word?",1,1,0,0,0

"AITA for continuing to put money on my ex-husband’s commissary account in state prison? He’s remarried, I’m remarried but I’m so scared for his safety.. So much freaking back story here it’s not even funny. I married my HS boyfriend when we were both 18. It was a truly toxic trip that included everything bad under the sun. Married for 6 years until he was sentenced to 57 year felony sentence with no possibility for parole. I divorced him and literally moved across the country to get away from his family. Having said that, I still love him. It’s not a healthy love, but it’s still there.

He remarried in prison, I remarried to a great man, now have wonderful kids and a literal suburban white picket fence life that is light years from my past.

"AITA for quitting my job without notice?.   

I’ve been working for the same company for 12 years, basically doing the same job and I’m so tired of it. 

It used to be ok, but now it’s bad, my boss quit and my work load reduced, so far today I did not receive a single e-mail, on the other hand lately I get annoyed with every e-mail that I get. It’s HQ questioning every move we’ve done in the past. They now want me to handle different tasks and have someone come to train me, but I’m already thinking about quitting the job. The person that is supposed to train me is so annoying, talks a lot, but does not work much. Asking a lot of questions for things that should not concern him. I pretty much dislike all the people that I’m supposed to work with. My boss was really chill, did not bother me much at all, all the new people are younger and think they need to watch over me every second and question the way I’ve worked for 12 years. 

Feel like I’m in a dilemma, don’t think I owe them anything, but hard for me to just quit. On the other hand they had let people go on the spot, end of day on the last day of the month, bye don’t come back and your health insurance ends today. Good luck. Such an asshole move!","YTA 

It sounds like the company is trying to review its processes and improve upon them, thus asking about work done in the past and implementing the new training you’re receiving. 

You sound extremely resistant to change. It sounds like you think that because you’ve been there so long, that your way of doing things must be the best way. This is rarely true in most industries, most business processes can be improved upon as technology & society advances. 

Your comment about your coworkers being young is concerning. What does their age have to do with anything?  They may be questioning the way you work because more efficient ways to do things have been implemented and they’re trying to help you, or maybe they’ve been told to “watch over” you by your superiors, to make sure you’re following process because they sense you’re adverse to change. 

Your trainer being annoying is not a reason to quit. Most people have to deal and work with people they do not like or get along with, after 12 years you should know this. This reasoning is immature and only shows that you’re incapable of managing relationships in the workplace. If they truly talk too much about non work related things, it’s your responsibility to complain to your current boss about it, not just whine about it. If you have done this, it wasn’t in your post. 

I think you need to embrace the change and try your best to assimilate. If the new environment really isn’t  for you, it would be disrespectful to quit without notice. You’ve been there over a decade and it sounds like they are trying to invest in you with training, etc. Quitting without notice would just be a slap in the face and would definitely make you the asshole.",1,1,0,0,0

It’s often the same cycle, I planned in getting certain properties and in the end, the crucial parts of the plan get stolen and then is like I have no goals or anything to play to. One player left and gave me and other player his money and properties, so if someone already did it and no one cared I thought I could do the same. I chose the player with least properties (3 cheap properties) and money (like 250$)and gave everything (6 properties, 1 service and around 800$).

He ended up winning and one player got mad at me for what I did, even though I just basically gave him my game, adding little to nothing to his.

"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to get a smartphone. So my boyfriend and I have been dating a bit over a year and by far the biggest issue is that he doesn’t have a smartphone. He had a flip phone. The man lives like it’s 1990, the only way to contact him is to call or email. But he doesn’t check his email except for at the end of the day.

I’ve offered to get him a phone, and he has turned me down. He can afford one easily, I’ve offered him one, he just chooses not to. This causes issues because sometimes I want to contact him but can’t call, and he doesn’t like texting on the phone. 

All of my ex boyfriends and I texted each other a few times throughout the day, whether or not we were going to see each other. He says he’s willing to call once a day after work, but we see each other nearly every day, that’s not the problem. It’s just weird that he lives like the world doesn’t use modern communication.

I’ve pressed the issue with him and he always shuts it down. Today I wanted to ask him what we were doing for dinner, but I was in the car with friends and didn’t want to make a call in the car. Well that leaves me with no options to contact him.

I brought it up again today and he basically said this is the way it is and if I keep bringing it up that he is going to get mad. AitA?","YTA.

"AITA for calling out my friends on how they treat me?. It's the summer break (January, in Australia). I'm mostly bored alone in my room, planning for things to do with my batchmates (in this case the people I thought of as friends). We've hung out a few times during the semester, mostly during labs and stuff where we would discuss answers and stuff. Though the worst part during the semester was the times I find out that these guys were hanging out, going to trips, parties and didn't invite me. Probably sounds childish at this point, but I've always wanted to be a part of something. Anyways, ever so often when I find out that they did that and told them about, they keep saying they'll call the next time. Same thing that's been happening during school, and undergrad. Funny enough, I've told them how I didn't enjoy my time in undergrad and high school, and felt that it was gonna to repeat once again. 

Now, back to the summer break, I'm planning a few things we could considerably do during the summer  break. Every time I message them, it's the usual ""Sure dude, but not this time. Maybe later"" or ""Hmm, maybe. Is XYZ coming?"" etc. So naturally no plan of my actually happened. 

So a few days ago, I notice  that some of these ""friends"" are in a trip individually (i.e, their IG story shows that they're at a trekking spot, the usual generic landscape shot of a cool background). At first, I thought they were separate trips,probably sharing it now cause #throwback or something like that, and didn't want to get annoyed right away. 

A day later, I see one of them post a pic of all of them together on IG. Thinking of all the times this kept happening to me during my school and undergrad, and knowing that these guys left me out several times too; I WAS PISSED. At this point, I felt like I was used, just as always. So after a few pints, I started messaging some of them, about how scummy they are. And today, seeing if I got any response from them, I realise I was blocked by those guys I messaged.

This was a first to me. Being blocked that is. And for some reason, I'm having mixed feelings about it. Somewhat really angry, that there is no resolution to this, and somewhat sad, because these are the few people I know here, and thought I knew really well (Cause international student jitters).

"AITA For telling my younger son that his older brother will take over my business one day, not him.. I have three children. A twelve year old daughter, a ten year old son, and a nine year old son.

I am also old fashioned like my father. I believe the oldest son inherits the family business, and in many ways becomes the new ""head"" of the main family.

"WIBTA If I didn't contribute to repairs for a broken macbook screen despite being partially responsible. A couple of days ago my flatmate (FM) stepped on my GFs macbook. He then went about his day and it wasnt until that evening that my GF found that it had a broken screen. FM claims he was so sleepy that morning that he A) hadn't noticed it was on the floor and B) hadn't noticed it was broken after stepping on it, which is why he didn't mention it.
For context - The night before FM and I were watching a film and I had plugged the laptop into the TV with the HDMI and after we had finished, I just left it there as we had done previously.

After my GF went to the apple-recommended store, they quoted £400 for repairs and £83 for labour cost. Initially, FM said he would pay it (although he was reluctant and upset about it - September has been a harsh month on all our bank accounts). Now he's claiming that I should contribute towards it - say the £83 Labour cost, because I left the laptop on the floor.

I can't help but feel partially responsible because I was watching the film with him the night before and didnt move the laptop after we had done. But at the same time I didn't tread on it, so it seems a little strange that I have to contribute a reasonably large amount of money (we are near broke, so it is) for someone else treading on my GFs laptop.

I am also a little suspicious of his timing of this request given I just told him that I had managed to save a little money from the month before, and we got paid today.

We told her to let us check in her house first and then we'll go check outside.

"AITA for proposing to my girlfriend at my uncle's funeral?. So my uncle was almost like my father. He pretty much raised me when my dad couldn't, (he got arrested and imprisoned in Columbia for some bullshit drug charges for a few years before the incompetent legal system realized he was innocent). My uncle rarely took things seriously which is what i loved about him. He took me to strip clubs when i was 15, took me on a road trip to sketchy places across eastern europe when i was 17. Together we hitchhiked across Chile and Argentina when i was 18. We went to wild parties near home too. I had the courage to ask out my girlfriend (now engaged) because he pretty much forced me to start talking to a rally hot girl that walked across us in the bar. If you guys ever played the Uncharted game series, my uncle is basically Sully. He looks similar and his voice is similar  and his personality is too. My uncle was one of the greatest people I've ever met. I have so many good memories with him. He even joked about how his funeral should be a party and that we all should get completely wasted. He believed funerals shouldn't be so sad and gloomy, celebrate the life the dead lived not grieve over them being gone, be glad they existed. He even jokingly said that if he were to die soon (obviously he was hoping to live longer than this) he said he'd want me to propose to my gf during his funeral. I started dating her because of him and i should take it to the next step in honor with him. I honestly thought this was a fucking hilarious idea but also a way of commerotaing him so i told him i'd do it if he were to die before we were married. Unfortunately he died a month ago from a stroke that was completely unexpected and i was devastated. I tried to get my family to throw a party in his honor as he requested but nobody wanted to do it no matter how much i tried so i decided to propose to my girlfriend during his funeral. My girlfriend knew my uncle for 5 years and saw him as a father figure as well ( she didn't have one and we both started dating when we were 16) and although she didn't have prior knowledge of my proposal, she wasn't shocked by it and thought it was cute.

SO the day of the funeral comes and we all speak kind words about him. They save me to make the last speech and i go on for probably 20 minutes about how much he meant to me.

Roommate is constantly having guests over without telling us, but it isnt just like any other situation. These guests come over AFTER 10pm (when im normally in bed) and stay until the early morning. They are also loud, and I have a dog that barks when anyone enters the house. Roommate is an aspiring DJ and always playing loud music. He meets women on dating apps and has them into our home to spend the night, constantly. It used to literally be a different woman every day. Now its a new woman every week. He has no sense of cleanliness, meaning, he doesnt ever think anything is dirty therefore he doesnt care to clean. He is a complete night owl, waking up at 2-4pm and going to bed between 4-6 am.

However this is my last full semester of college and I am in 27 credit hours. Yes, 27. Obviously my life is about to be dedicated to school, and sleep, not much else. 
With that said, I am debating drafting a 'Spring 2019 House rules' sheet because I am tired of having to ask him if he has guests, or telling him to turn the music down, etc.

All members of house must be aware of incoming guests-- overnight or not (so fucking tired of walking downstairs in my robe and he's got a group of friends over)

Headphones must be used past midnight (the bass drop wakes me up. not the music, the vibrating bass.)

No guests (except lady friends in the bedroom) allowed over after midnight on school nights (cant be loud if theyre not there)

Cleaning rotation implemented (cleaning floors, counters, etc)

No smoking blunts downstairs (shared space, I am trying to quit smoking)


We are not currently under any lease, i've debated just kicking him out, but as this semester started today I've decided its better to just make this semester as smooth as possible, which I think would be easiest under clearly defined rules. 

I assume many people will say its unfair to me to limit what someone else can do in their own home (I own the house, he is tenant, there is a power imbalance), but our original lease agreement (expired last june, didnt care to renew) stated similar rules, he just rarely followed them, and it didnt bother me until it started happening more and more frequently.","YTA

You signed up for too many classes and are stressed out, now you're taking it out on your roommate. If it's a house you own, and you can afford to live there alone, go ahead and push them out.

Asking for notice before anyone is brought over the the most egregiously bad part. That's completely unrealistic and a violation of their privacy. Headphones aren't unreasonable, nor are some of the others.

"AITA for telling my friend to not pay too much attention to the hurtful things his gf says when she’s on her period. Well here goes. My friend was talking to me about how his girlfriend kept being an asshole to him and how she kept getting mad over her period for the littlest things. He was ranting to me about how he might break up with her over something extremely personal she said and I responded with this:
“yo man calm down. It’s not her fault. They can’t think straight when they hormones acting up like this. Treat whatever she says or does in this period with a grain of salt. She’s really not in full control of her actions and probably isn’t meaning half the stuff she says”

So yeah I was tryna defend her and stuff. But apparently when they made up a few days later, he showed her the message, saying “this dude saved our relationship”. She got in a fit and came at me and said me saying that was sexist and misogynistic, and that me implying that she couldn’t think straight because of her period was the epitome of toxic masculinity.

"AITA For refusing to leave a bar?. Last Friday I finished my shift at work and decided to go to this little bar that my friend works at. After I arrived I saw that the place was mostly empty. There were only 3 people in it. The bartender and two girls I know. Now I wasn't really expecting to see them there so I went and said hello. I immediately noticed that they were angry and irritated. I didn't know why but I started a conversation with them (Big mistake). I asked them what they were doing, how their day was and why they were so annoyed. They didn't feel like talking and I got mostly vague answers. I realized that they weren't in the mood so I left them alone and sat on a chair that was really close to them. I got a beer and started to dick around on my phone. Nothing really interesting was happening and my battery was low so I turned the phone off and started to stare at the wall pointlessly. I was pretty much lost in thoughts. 

Apparently one of the girls got really offended by that because she thought I was staring at her. She came to me and told me that I should leave. I was confused and asked why. She said I was ''getting on her nerves''. After she said that I actually laughed a bit. Me laughing actually got her even more annoyed. I told her that I don't really want to cause any problems but I'm not gonna leave a bar just because she was feeling irritated. She then proceeded to accuse me provoking her on purpose by staring at her. I tried to explain that I literally was staring at the wall not her, but she wouldn't listen. Eventually she started to piss me off and I told her that she isn't interesting nor attractive so there really isn't a reason for me to look at her. Now after I said that she started to look at me menacingly and actually said that she would break my jaw. 

My reaction was literally this: ''Who do you think you are? I get that you're having a bad day and something is clearly upsetting you, but you don't have the right or justification to vent that crap on me.''. She started to threaten me and call me some dumb names but the bartender had enough and suggested that I leave. I want to make it clear he didn't ask me nor force me, he just said it would be smart to leave and come back later. I said no. I'm a paying customer and I haven't done anything to escalate this situation. I told that girl that things don't have to be the way they are and we can just shake hands and forget this happened. She didn't want to hear it and stormed off with the other girl and told me to ''Watch my ass''.

The bartender started to lecture me about how he doesn't want trouble at the establishment and I should have just left and not made things difficult. I was a bit baffled by this. I told me him that he's an asshole and left. I didn't want to argue anymore.

Later on someone told me that the bartender apparently was good friends with that girl (News to me) and he knew what was troubling her and didn't want to upset her. Apparently the girl was kicked out   
 her parents house? Not exactly sure if that's true or not.

"AITA for not letting my teenage son go trick-or-treating?. Some backstory: I have two children: my stepson Jack (15) and my daughter from my first marriage, Jill (9). Jack is autistic and although he is not cognitively challenged he has some childlike interests and behaviors. When I married his father I was worried the kids wouldn’t get along, but because Jack has a lot of the same interests as Jill, they’re now best friends and spend a lot of time together. To Jill, Jack is just another kid her age who happens to be six feet tall and shaving.

This past August I was injured in an accident and as a result I’ve been mostly immobilized and homebound. My husband works two jobs and is only home for a few hours in the morning, when he gets the kids up and drives them to school. I have a SAHM neighbor, Nancy, who I’m friendly with because her daughter is friends with mine. Since my accident she has gone out of her way to be helpful, picking up the kids from school, bringing over meals, and helping to take care of the house, and I’m very grateful to her for this.

The issue comes in with how she treats Jack. She’s a very traditional sort of person and seems uncomfortable with how Jack behaves. If she’s taking her daughter and Jill shopping or to the movies and he asks to come along, she always shoots him down. Jack has told me that she’s called him immature for liking things like kids’ cartoons and toys and will ask him why he can’t act like a “normal teenage boy”. She’s volunteered to take Jill trick-or-treating with her and her daughter, but she’s made it clear that Jack isn’t invited because he’s too old for Halloween and should be out with friends like a “normal” teenager.

Jack is crushed. He LOVES Halloween and he was excited about going trick-or-treating. He doesn’t really have any other friends he can go out with and he’s told me he doesn’t want to stay home to pass out candy. I want him to go have fun with his sister, but I know if I insist Nancy take him, she’ll most likely ignore him or make snide comments and take all of the fun out of his night.

My husband has told me not to confront Nancy because she’s been doing so much for us, and he also thinks Jack is too old for trick-or-treating. AITA for thinking Jack should stay home on Halloween instead of having to deal with Nancy’s attitude?

"AITA for telling other people my gaming partner isn’t my girlfriend even though it hurts her feelings?. Throwaway for obvious reasons, I play a specific game on a competitive level and I’m part of a two man duo. Well, me and this chick. She’s my partner only in the gaming sense. 

In my real life I’m engaged to a well known streamer. She’s gorgeous and wedding plans are going well. But for the sake of her audience and her fans, we don’t necessarily tell the public we’re engaged because a lot of her male viewers might get upset and stop watching her channel.

That’s the background info.

A question I get all the time is whether my gaming partner is my fiancé because I do say I’m engaged but rarely reveal to whom. Last night was the first time someone asked me while she was present “are you the legendary fiancé? You two have great chemistry” or something like that. I laughed it off and said “Hell no. Get out of here. I would never date her.”

She later approached me after the game and told me that it really hurt her feelings. She was saying that I could’ve just said no (which I did, I said no) and I didn’t have to make it sound like she was undesirable. I don’t really get where she’s coming from. She said i made her sound like she wanted me and I publicly rejected her. No idea where she got all that. 

I know for a fact she has no feelings for me. She has men endlessly trying to get with her because they think it’s “hot” that she’s in esports. She’s never made a move on me or flirted with me. Her nickname for me is “asshole” “buttfuck” and “nubcake” which is hardly affectionate. She’s also great friends with my fiancé.

So why is this such a big deal? Is what I said that much of an asshole thing? Am I the asshole here or is she overreacting?

I'm not dating anyone at the moment, but I have been friends with this guy (we'll call him Frank) for quite a while now. Although we are friends, he has confessed to me that he has had a crush on me from the start. I'm not really into Frank relationship-wise (and I made sure to tell him, he was nice about it and he was okay with being just friends), but to me he's always been very attractive: defined muscles, nice hair, green eyes, an absolute marble statue. And he likes to show it off too, since he always has a tight shirt on, hell sometimes he even goes shirtless. I have seen him shirtless many times, so I got used to it, but something changed lately, because one time we were in my room chilling, he ended up taking his shirt off and I couldn't resist. I got extremely horny and had sex with him. It felt great, but after the fact I kinda regret it, because I still don't want a relationship with him. I talked to him about it and he said he was okay with just being friends (we've had a long talk, he was very understanding). A couple of weeks passed and we end up hanging out in my room again. I got horny again and made a move. This time, he stopped me and he asked what I was doing and if I had feelings for him. I... didn't answer and just went on with it.

We hadn’t turned in our final projects yet and most of the other classes hadn’t had their final tests or projects due either. What I did was take everything out of her backpack while no one was looking (it was a pretty full backpack as she had all advanced classes) and put it into mine and put a few of her other belongings in the other kids backpacks so they would be suspected first. The class was over before she was finished with the test so I went home and threw all of her stuff in the trash. I never said a word about it to anyone and no one suspected me of doing it.

"AITA for not wanting to give my dog away. A couple of years ago my family and I lived with my grandparents in a house with a big backyard which was perfect for my 2 dogs. They would have lots of fun with my grandmother's dog and fight ocassionally but nonetheless had a great time. After living there for a year, my parents moved out and started living in a smaller home that had about 1/5 of free space available for my dogs to play in. This situation was no longer suitable for one my dogs who is super hyper and definitely not an indoor dog. We left my dog with my grandparents to care for him and we visited whenever we had a chance. A couple of months after the move, I started college. This made it  difficult for me to visit him  since I was 2 hours away and with no car. Now graduated and living back at home I have been wanting to get him back and take care of him but have not been able to because of the lack of available space for him. I knew he was in good hands and had a buddy there to play with. That was the case up until last week. 


Last week I received a call from my grandmother. Her dog of over 12 years had passed away in a very sudden death. My heart broke. She loved him very much and cared for him greatly. 

Today I received a call from my grandfather about my dog. Due to being away, lack of transportation, and lack of income, I had not taken my dog to get check ups for a couple of years. My grandfather told me he cares for my dog and if it's okay with me, he would like to register him under his name and take him to the vet. I told him I would get back to him with the answer and I'm leaning towards a no. I love my dog very much and if it were up to me, I would have him at my house to care for him. I have been saving up for months to have enough money for a vet and had been thinking about taking him even before my grandmother's dog passing away. I know my grandfather is very low on money now and I feel bad for giving him that responsibility. I do not want to give my dog away and I'm financially ready to give him the support and attention he needs. But maybe it's too late and should have done more years ago.

"AITA for confronting my mom about the way she told me to do something?. (This happened a while ago so I will use the ages we were then.)

CONTEXT: For most of my life, it was just me (23F) and my mom (64F) under one roof. Dad moved back to the parents’ home country to work when I was very young and older brother wasn’t home a lot because of the military and school. Mom and I always had a rough relationship because of our complicated family situation (abuse, mental illness). We didn’t talk to each other much even if both of us were home.

One day, Mom tells me she was diagnosed with cancer and that she’ll be making a sudden trip to the home country for medical care. She gets a second diagnosis from the doctors there who tell her it’s a benign tumor, she gets it removed, and then makes the decision to live in the home country with my dad to receive medical care there. I’m still a student with no stable income, so she said that Dad will support me financially while I live in the house alone, and this was a huge lifestyle change for me because I had never lived alone before, but I ended up liking the solitude a lot.

ISSUE: Mom came back to the US for a couple months and at this time, things were still kinda tense between us. One morning, I woke up but stayed in bed to be a potato for a bit. Something about me is that I cannot do anything immediately after I wake up, I have to have some time to fully wake up and get in the mood to be productive before I do anything. I get up to go to the bathroom (still in my sleep shirt and undies), Mom catches me as I leave the bathroom, and tells me to do something. I instantly get annoyed, and I admit, gave her some attitude, but still did it anyway.

Next, I receive a text from my brother. Brother said my mom complained to him about my attitude. This instantly makes me furious because 1) she complained to my brother instead of just confronting me about it and 2) of course I’m gonna be annoyed if I’m told to do something when I’ve just woken up and am still half naked. I confronted her about this, and she goes off on me saying that I should’ve done what she told me to do a long time ago (and this was something that she told me to do maybe a few days to a week ago, but I just never got around to it.) I say that I would’ve been more receptive to doing it without complaints or attitude if maybe she asked me to politely, but instead she commanded me to do it. This escalates into a fight so I give up trying to communicate and leave the house.

I admit, I grew up a spoiled brat. I got almost everything I wanted as a child and I was never expected to do chores. So maybe that part of me that’s still a spoiled brat reacted badly to my mom simply telling me to do something that I should’ve done without attitude or complaints. But at the same time, I grew up with my mom constantly taking out her anger (from my dad’s abuse) on me, and I grew up very fearful of her and resented her for a long time for her poor parenting.

I'm in a discord/reddit group where people can trade/sell accounts for this game I'm fond of.

Trading/selling provides an easy way to obtain characters that may no longer be acessible. Keep in mind that this is a gacha game (basically a virtual casino), which means summoning these characters in the first place is no easy task since it requires either a lot of money or luck.

A few weeks ago, I received a trade offer on one of my game accounts. I was more interested in selling, but I concluded that doing the trade would be profitable for me since their account was higher in value. I accepted and we traded.

The drama starts when I put the account up for sale. Someone approaches me and claims the account belongs to them and that it had been stolen from them by the person I traded with. They demanded the account back and I was at a loss about what to do, since selling/trading stolen accounts was against the group's rules and I was concerned about being banned/blacklisted.

I called one of the group's moderators to help us. The account's owner was able to prove that it originally belonged to them and that it was stolen. I proved that I had no knowledge that the account was stolen and that I acquired it without breaking any rules. The moderator declared that I had no obligation to return the account, but we were free to reach some sort of agreement. The owner made some offers that didn't really interest me, but I was reasonable enough to remove the account from my ads until we solved the mess. I felt bad for them and wanted to do the right thing, so I told them I wouldn't mind returning their account **for free** in one month, once I had enough money to buy an account for myself.

They accepted, but the very next day they started begging for the account ahead of time. They were excessively dramatic in saying how much they cared about their account and wanted it back. I insisted that they'd have to either wait or offer something of equal value. This went on for days. I tried being polite and understanding this whole time since they WERE scammed, but they kept begging and being obnoxious. I ran out of patience one day and decided not to return it anymore. They lost their mind, called me names and threatened to spread the word that I was a scammer and a liar. I responded with equal animosity and cut all contact with them.

I hate entitled people, but I honestly don't know how I would act if I were in their shoes. It must be terrible to see it within your reach and not be able to do anything. AITA for not returning it?

EDIT: Some additional info:

\-The group has a free middleman service, where a third person joins the trade to make sure what is being offered is what is being delivered. It is a safe way to guarantee that nothing will go wrong and that there will be no scams. The person who had their account stolen willingly dismissed this service since they were in a hurry to trade and the service relies on the middlemen's availability. They literally handed their account to a complete stranger with no trading references or reputation in the group.

\-The actual scammer was banned from the group and blacklisted.

\-The reason why I wanted to hold onto the account for a month was because I felt it was unfair for me to take the fall for someone else's mistake. If I were to simply return it without expecting anything in return, I would be the one suffering a financial loss for something that wasn't really my fault. I only offered to return the account for free in a month because I intend to buy an account for myself soon, and with it, I would have no more use for their account.

\-Not sure if it was really a kid.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the comments and for the insight, everyone. You guys are right. A man is only as good as his word. I returned the account.","YTA.

"AITA for trying to convince my family to disown my sister?. She's barely eighteen and she's already looking to settle down. She has only dated guys who are older than thirty. She rejected going to UCLA because her boyfriend told her to. She has stated to me multiple times that she's trying to get pregnant.

"AITA for writing an incredibly mean paragraph with the intention of making my friend cry?. Hey all, long time lurker and first time poster to this sub so I'll just keep this short and to the point.

&#x200B;

Last night in my group chat I was talking with my friends when I started joking about writing them a ""paragraph"". These are basically just roasts that are meant to be overly rude and hurtful. They started out as a way for me to vent about people I didn't like but eventually developed into a joke because I showed my friends them and they found my insults humorous. Anyway, I was saying stuff like ""don't mess with me or i'll write you a paragraph"" and he kept insisting I do it. I asked him multiple times if he was sure, and my friends even warned him not to ask for it. He still insisted anyways so I wrote him one. Being completely honest it was one of the meaner ones. My friends described it as ruthless and brutal. I have some misgivings about this person so I vented my frustrations with him through this. He read it and seemed genuinely hurt even though we warned him and had told him not to take this whole thing to heart. Now i'm worried I've gone a bit to far.

"AITA if I think fat acceptance is FUCKING STUPID (yall happy?). (This is a reupload)

Fat acceptance is not only promoting people to become fatter or even obese. It's telling people (like my damn self) that it's ok to be overweight when in fact it's actually incredibly unhealthy. 

I get it if you have natural curves and are in shape ect. But if you have skin hanging from you body, you need to get in shape or at least eat healthier.

I'm 80 pounds overweight. It was getting worse because of all the fat acceptance in the media. I thought it was perfectly healthy to be overweight. People told me to love myself. But, if I truly loved myself I would get my ass in the gym and work it off.

"AITA for creating & sharing a sarcastic 'How to be unhealthy' gif/blog post. I have a blog that has been up and running for a while and like many bloggers I joined a Facebook group to share content and get feedback on that content.

It's very hard to get your content noticed these days, especially in the form of medium-long text based posts, so I thought I would share an idea with the group - basically I would create a gif that would serve as a condensed version of my posts, but much easier to consume on social media and with a click through at the end.

So I shared this idea with the group using this sample gif I made: [https://gph.is/g/ZOAAGjd](https://gph.is/g/ZOAAGjd)  \- btw I stripped all branding out of this gif because I'm not trying to promote my blog, but at the end I did have a message saying 'Please do the opposite of everything you read here, for you and those that care about you' that is not in this version.

It did not go down well at all...

Straight away I got shot down with a shit load of comments saying that I was fat shaming, that this is disgusting, smug, condescending etc... I assume that was based around the title being 'How to get fat, unhealthy and die young'.

Initially I just thought this was an interesting/funny way to confront people's unhealthy lifestyle habits - hoping that being confronted like this would more effectively cause people to think about their own lifestyle in general.

I was wrong and everyone hated it, and I get the feeling they now have little time for me personally.

I genuinely didn't think this was fat shaming and didn't set out to make people feel bad - but the response to that post was definitely a hit to my confidence and since then I've just kind of shelved the whole idea.

"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to take me to get tampons?. a little backstory about me that plays a part in this question. I grew up in a well, to be so blunt, I grew up in a very sexist household. my dad's belief was women were meant to stay at home, raise kids and never show emotion. my mom also shared this idea. Growing up it was a big taboo things in my house to talk about menstruation and the use of tampons/pads. we had to be discreet about it and never let my dad or brothers know. We weren't even allowed to buy them if one of the guys came shopping with us.

Flash forward I'm now 30 and have worked through a lot from my childhood. but I'm still very private on certain things, especially my period even with my bf. Well I get it on the day my car's in the shop and notice I'm out of my heavy flow tampons. I call a friend to take me (I don't want to but I'm more comfortable with her taking me than my bf). My bf gets upset with this and I explain I need a personal item. He tells me I'm being absurd calling my friend when we live together and he's perfectly capable of driving me.

I go, get the item and come back expecting him to have cool down. nope! He's still huffing and saying I'm being childish. I remind him about my dad and that but he continues on and on. He thinks I'm being a ridiculous a hole. I think it shouldn't be that big of a deal.

"AITA for massaging my guy friend in front of his girlfriend?. I (32F) met my friend (30M) at work last year. We both quit our jobs and became close friends, he introduced me straight away to his girlfriend and this girl is a gem. We hang out a lot the three of us and I love both of them now, even if I knew him first. 

Today, we were hanging out at the beach for the fireworks and my guy friend was in a bad mood. I asked him what was wrong and he said he had a bad headache. I asked him if he wanted me to give him a head massage because I usually give massages to my friends & family.

However, he's pretty tall so I couldn't give it to him while sitting. He then put his head on my laps and I was massaging his head while talking to his girlfriend. I didn't realise it was an uncomfortable situation before seeing the girlfriend's face, which was a bit sceptical. I then quickly put an end to it and sat back at my place.

I'm scared I made her mad, even if she was super nice to me the rest of the evening, I find myself completely stupid for not realising it would be super awkward.

"AITA for asking the winners of our fantasy football league to accept less winnings in order to forgive the entry fee of a sick friend. I run a 10-man fantasy football league with a group various friends that don't necessarily know one another. The entry fee is $100 with the payouts being $500 for 1st, $300 for 2nd, $100 for 3rd, and $100 for regular season best record. One of the participants was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma after the season started and has accrued some hefty medical bills (he is currently in remission with a good outlook, but will require treatment throughout his life). I asked the three winners (the person with the regular season best record also got 3rd place) if they'd accept $33 less in winnings in order to forgive that member's entry fee. One person said yes, one hasn't responded, and one sent me a private message saying ""it's not my place to sacrifice my winnings for him."" I followed up with the latter, saying I wasn't going to ask for $100 when he owes tens of thousands, I also wasn't going to ask the remaining 9 players to pay more than they signed up for, and if he's intent on receiving $500 rather than $467 given the situation that I would cover the remainder. To be honest, I thought he would concede at that point, but he just ""liked"" that response, leaving me to assume that's what he wants to happen. AITA for thinking everyone would be on board with this?

Edit: To those who've concluded that I somehow asked the 3 winners for any kind of additional money while not paying anything myself, let me clarify. Ten people were all expected to pay $100, including myself. What I asked was not for the 3 winners to pitch in additional money, but to accept a payout as if only 9 people participated in the league. The end result being 9 people paying $100 each, no one paying more and no one paying less.

"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to meet my parents?. Might be kinda long I apologize.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years and he hasn’t met my parents yet because of my own personal issues with them. 

About a month ago I asked my boyfriend to marry me he said yes but in the condition that he gets to meet my parents beforehand. I don’t want him to meet them and when I told him this it blew up into massive argument with him yelling at me and questioning why I’m keeping a big part of my life a secret from him (it’s not as big as he thinks it is but more on that later) and kicking me out of our apartment so he has time to think about our relationship.

Now a little backstory about my boyfriend, he’s a great guy the nicest person I ever met in my life and he gave me the time of day when I was at a point in my life where the sun never shined after getting discharged from the military for suicidal ideation. He was the most beautiful person I’ve ever met and made the few months I would see him walking around my college campus worth it and mean something. 

The thing about my boyfriend is his specific quirk I’ll call it. It’s a harmless thing and it helps him feel more comfortable in his own skin. My boyfriend is small 5’2 to be exact with feminine features he said he never looked like a boy and that caused him great distress as a kid but he never felt that he wasn’t a boy. So his quirk is that he dresses up in feminine clothing dresses, high heels the whole nine yards and he looks amazing breathtaking completely phenomenal. When we first met I was already gay but confused why I was so insanely attracted to this woman only for him to tell me months later that he was actually a he in women’s clothing. But that’s an entirely different story.

So we began dating and things were perfect he lived his life to the fullest without regret and it was perfect. I rarely if ever talked about my past before meeting him. He knows about my suicidal thoughts and that I was discharged because of it but he doesn’t know the reason why I had those thoughts he respected my privacy about it and didn’t pry which I was thankful for.

Now backstory on my parents. They hated that I was gay. When I came out at 16 they all but cut me off I still lived with them and didn’t really have anywhere else to go. I was abused relentlessly emotionally and physically I have scars on my body from cigarette burns and getting hit with objects like bats, metal rods all of that. I was a gay kid in a very rural and very religious part of Georgia so not only was I getting abused at home but also out on the streets and school. My only way out was to join the military and I did I left Georgia and my parents and never looked back for the next 6 years. My suicidal thoughts started at around 17 and when I joined the army I thought it would get better but it didn’t it got worse until I was discharged at 20.

By this time I was in contact with an aunt who found out what happened to me at my hometown and offered me a place to live for as long as I wanted while I get my life on track. So I move in with her in L.A. and then that’s where I met my boyfriend.

So now my boyfriend doesn’t know anything about my abuse when I came out and I don’t want him to because I don’t want him to think of me as damaged goods and boy am I damaged. I know that if I did introduce my boyfriend to my parents they would only hurl insults at him being a man in a dress and how much of an f-word he is and my boyfriend could dress in men’s clothes but I know how uncomfortable that is for him so I don’t want him to deal with any of that in my eyes I dealt with enough of that for the two of us and more. My aunt is still in contact with her sister (my mother) and she could set up a meeting between all of us so it’s possible.

But my question is am I the asshole for keeping my past a secret and from protecting him from the shit show that is my parents?

EDIT: In the comments I posted about it but my boyfriend and I talked about everything and have come into an agreement. He will meet my parents but at any sign of hostility from my parents we’re leaving. 

Also he said I should ask him to marry me again after we meet my parents but he already said yes so I guess I’m unofficially officially engaged.

"AITA for being pissed off that my friend didn't get me a bday present?. Throwaway; high school drama alert.

This happened in our senior year of high school but it's basically ongoing. For my birthday, my friend of 9 years gave me a birthday card that essentially says ""I'm sorry i can't get you a present this year, I'll treat you sometime"". Now, I am not one to complain about gifts and I was happy with just the letter-- what really irked me was that at the end of the year, she got all of her teachers something. And I am not talking about simple stuff like chocolates; she ordered pens and cups and other things online, in store, etc. She was running around being busy with delivering gifts and stuff.

Fast forward to a month later, we're going to the movies. I offered to pay for her tickets but she paid for mine too because it was the birthday promise. I was taken aback. I planned on having an actual lunch/dinner date with her where we could sit down, talk, have a good time. Not her just paying for my movie tickets because she just wanted to get the promise over with.

I talked to another friend about how I felt like I didn't matter (even though I spent a lot of time, thoughts, and resources for her bday). She low balled me and gave her effort somewhere else. The other friend said that my close friend probably feels more comfortable with me and thinks that she doesn't have to shower me with gifts or anything to prove our friendship. I can definitely understand this point of view, taking into account that my close friend probably didn't realize that I would feel this way and that she did it with no harm in mind (she's a nice girl but kind of slow ). This is also plausible because she spent major money on another girl's present, but their relationship is pretty sad to look at (like master and servant).

I haven't told her about how I felt but it definitely made me take a step back and look at our friendship. Although I still talk to her, I am not putting in as much effort as before.

Am I the asshole for not liking how my friend only gave me a letter for my bday, yet went out of her way to buy gifts for others (with the possible reason that she feels comfortable enough with me)? I also feel like it might be petty to bring this up?

Edit: I'm not expecting a galore of gifts since ppl might misunderstand. I keep all the letters that friends have given me over the years. I was actually looking forward to eating out with her (since at that point it was a while since we sat down and had a talk), but she just bought me movie tickets for the sake of getting the promise over with.

"AITA for being critical with an intern?. I own a small chain of tire shops in my county and the adjacent one. We have six stores in total and I work out of the main one in my small town. We have a lot of different jobs and a lot of experience to be earned because of that-we have inventory in every store, several large machines to operate, and each store has different office positions. Mine, for instance, has a management department, billing, customer support, legal, etc. We do accept unpaid interns for office work occasionally, but only by application and usually not in the main store. I just don't have the patience for it usually. The main store is much larger than the others and I'm not only working in the main store-I have constant correspondence with the other managers to make sure there aren't any problems that don't get resolved ASAP. Add an unskilled intern requiring training? No thanks.

However, an old friend of mine who is prominent in the community approached me directly about his daughter's application. And like I said, small town. Even if the guy wasn't a long-time friend, public opinion is big for staying afloat in small areas and I'm not trying to burn any bridges. So I looked over her application, and it was good enough I'd probably have accepted her to another store, so I took her in. She's nineteen, full-time college (mostly online), and has no paying job, so she's basically interning whenever I let her. And she's not awful, per se, but it's clear she's never worked a day in her life. She didn't know how to file, she's never answered a phone with a professional greeting, she didn't know how time cards work...

It's been a slow process of teaching her things I don't usually have to teach my employees, and it's been aggravating because I still have the stress of my real employees making legitimate mistakes and not knowing how to fix it. As I suspected, I don't have the time or patience for a kid living off her parent's money and who doesn't have any real workable skills. This last week was especially stressful after a manager in another store quit suddenly, and I had even less patience for this girl. Most days I ended up dismissive, and one day I yelled at her over a very stupid mistake in filing (which she's made twice now, and once is more than enough). I mean, it's filing-it doesn't take a lot of brainpower. That day her dad messaged me saying she came home in tears and while he understands the ""tough boss"" approach, he'd appreciate it if I could lighten up since it's her first internship and she's young. I'm honestly tempted to message him back saying if she can't handle a work environment, she should quit-I'm not mistreating her, and if anything I think I've been lenient in teaching her common sense skills. My husband has suggested that this is not only a grievous misstep in handling our relationship, but I should also apologize to the girl for being overly critical.

We moved to a new city together so he could do a one-year Masters in the field while I tried to get more work experience. When he finished school, we both started applying to jobs in bigger, more exciting cities around the country (as most millennials do, haha.) So he tells me about this job he applied to at a big, well-known company, and it was a really exciting opportunity so I decided to apply as well. Well, things got awkward real fast as I got a job offer and my boyfriend did not. It's created a LOT of tension in our relationship, and he feels like I ""stole his dream job.""

"AITA for limiting my roommate's time with his partner in our apartment when I'm home?. I apologize that this is *extremely* long.

So he's not my roommate any more. He moved out last week.

He was and is a great friend, and we'd known each other for years. We were pretty tight and he knows probably more scarring secrets about me than any other person on the planet. He came from an abusive home life where was homeschooled, had information like his SS card and birth certificate hidden and withheld, his dad held him emotionally captive, and his step mom was verbally and physically abusive. Prior to moving in with me, he stayed in the adjacent house belonging to his dead grandmother, with no plumbing or electric. He's from way up north.

A few years into our friendship we resolved that when I got my own apartment in my current town, the stars aligned; it wasn't instant, but I moved him down here, much further south. I helped him get his paperwork in order to get the documents necessary for job hunting.

Disclaimer: I've never lived with a roommate outside of family and one year of college. It does not suit me, I do not like it, and I appreciate my privacy. I've not been in a relationship for more than a decade. I'm 27 now. He knows all of this.

I moved him in anyway, out of a brotherhood and deep friendship. We'd never actually met face to face, so I cautiously added him as an additional occupant rather than another party to the lease. This protected me, but it also gave him the benefit of ignoring rent aside from just paying it to me.

When he moved he didn't have a job; it took four months. I paid for those first four months, rent and food and utilities for the both of us. I also helped him get his job, just a mere ten minute walk away (he can't drive). I'm not trying to get points. I'd never ask for repayment, but I feel it's important for the ensuing events.

We agreed he would simply pay half rent, no utilities, and could help with the groceries later. In exchange he did the lion's share of the chores and cooked (something no one wants me to do). Rent went up $25 and I just didn't bother making adjustments. Utilities only amounted to about $150 all told, so I ate the costs.

Chores: He washed the dishes because without him there wouldn't be a mess to wash, and he was paying less for exactly this purpose. When he moved in there was a flea problem as well as a roach problem, so he was also vacuuming every day. As the fleas got under control, he vacuumed once or twice a week, and then stopped entirely. The roaches also got under control, and then he got lax about doing the dishes and leaving trash in his room (both things I explicitly discussed with him long before he moved in). We did the laundry as needed, and I take care of all cat related chores and costs (I have two).

All was fine until he started seeing this girl. He'd started getting lax already, but when they started talking it really went downhill. He grew increasingly distant and would chat with me briefly and then lock himself in his room for hours talking to her every night. Before I said something about the volume he never even shut his door.

First she constantly wanted me to text her as well, and chat, and we'd all be friends. That's just not my personality, nothing against her. Then I'd be going out the door to work and she'd be meeting me at the door to come in. Then she'd be there when I got home. This happened a couple of times before I set some boundaries. I said some stuff about not wanting her to be here all the time. I have a tone problem I've been told. One day they weren't here so I texted to see if they were coming home with a lighthearted joke about being able to strip down and do whatever if they weren't, which apparently made her uncomfortable (even though I didn't text her) because I'd been so cold leading up to all of this. Then they got here and my roommate made her stand outside in 30 degree weather under the assumption I didn't want her inside at all, which I clarified was not the case. He came to get her things, but when I told him they could come the fuck inside because of course, it's freezing, they went into his room, shut the door, and stayed there for 4 or 5 hours until about 1AM. I worked the next day, and it's a small apartment.

So I clarified my rules.

They were simple rules, maybe a bit strict. Basically it was just ""be mindful of my schedule, don't have her here for ages if I'm going to be home, and don't have sex on the cats (a real rule I added to express what I thought was the levity of the situation...and also I didn't want to clean splooge off of my cats)"". These were never respected to any real degree. She just ended up being here one specific day a week (a work day for me, so I got to come home to it) until about 1AM each time. I never said anything about it directly, but my frustration probably showed.

*Then* things got a little more tense, about a month later. I was sick one day, and he made dinner shortly after I woke up in the evening. The evening before was her usual evening, and they were together the whole time locked in his room until the usual time. While I was preparing to eat, unshowered and looking a mess, he lightly and happily added that she was also on her way over because she wanted some of his tortellini. Well I lost my cool, snapped, and told him that it was inconsiderate and I was going to go take a shower. He didn't understand *why* I thought it was inconsiderate, and neither did I. He told me I didn't have to get ready or anything just because she was coming over. I disagreed. I later realized the reason I was upset was because he never even thought to ask; he just invited her. He doesn't need my permission, but that had just been our relationship up to that point. The jury was still out on whether I thought any of that was fair.

Anyway I sulked in my room, and didn't speak to anyone (pretty much no different than any other time they were here except I wasn't sulking). Finally he opens the door and tells me she wants to talk. I don't want to talk, and tell him as much. He repeats his statement, I say ""[Roommate], I don't want to talk to [GF] right now"". I need time to think through my emotions, or I say things I don't mean or haven't processed fully. A few seconds later she barges into my hallway adjacent to his room and starts going off about how I have a problem and we're going to discuss it. I just continued sitting at the computer, looking away from her and doing my thing while she rambled on, getting frustrated. Occasionally I'd reiterate that I didn't want to talk right now. Didn't matter.

Eventually she gets me to crack and I spout off a laundry list of problems I have, largest of them being the slacking off of chores (in private I also explained to my roommate that when I'm here I'd rather they be playing Smash Bros. together in the living room than locked in his room fucking, or taking showers together). As I listed off my problems she'd give me a sassy ""mhm?"" and repeated this about 7 or 8 times. Finally I stopped complaining and simply said that ""her sassy 'mhm's?' weren't doing her any favors and the longer she went on the less I wanted her here at all"". That ended the conversation, and later she apparently cried. I was fully prepared to not speak to my roommate until after my pre-planned vacation, but he was amenable the next night, and we talked it out. He also talked it out with her, and it didn't go as smoothly behind closed doors. Full disclosure, I 100% eavesdropped on the conversation against my better judgement.

All I asked him to do was watch my cats while I was gone for the week. They were free to stay here and do whatever. I also found this an appropriate time to raise his rent from $400 to $500. I didn't do this solely as a punishment, though; I did it in exchange for doing *all* the chores. I would clean, wash dishes, and deal with the miscellany on top of what I already did. He told me he thought he should *only* pay half. So I calculated it for him. EDIT: Half is more than $500.

Things went on pretty much the same after I got back, except I never saw his GF again. Period. It went back to talking on the phone, except this time much earlier, and for much longer. He pretty much stopped cooking or doing anything outside of his room. Then he told me he was moving out, last week. He had applied for a job and had an interview; if he got it he was going to move out. I didn't realize the urgency in all this when he said it. I literally did not see him again after he told me he had the job. He stayed over at her place for several days, did a few more interviews...and then I got an email from my property manager saying he'd removed himself from the lease. An hour later he texted me and told me he wanted to give a proper goodbye but ""needed to get early rates on the apartment"" as if he couldn't move his stuff after signing the lease, and had moved all of his stuff out; he can't drive, so he just wasn't going to go to his last few shifts for his old job. The only job he's ever had. He had to pay the security deposit so he had to split his payments. He'd already paid me half earlier in the month before he mentioned anything, and then paid $150 with the breakup text he sent me. Conveniently he only paid $400 the one month he'd been asked to pay more. And like that he was gone. He asked me to hold his mail.

We exchanged some words after this all settled in, and, well, frankly ESH for the texts. Basically I just wanted more time; he'd needed a month if he was on the lease! That's after the fact, though. It hurts having to suddenly make up for $400 a month I didn't have to worry about, and it hurts that he basically did all of this behind my back. Mostly I just feel betrayed, but I'm not sure how at fault I am for the way this has all played out. My parents, friends, and coworkers are of course biased and they don't want to read 10,000 characters.

tl;dr I set some rules in our apartment for my roommate and his girlfriend, they talked to me about it, I wanted more money, and then he moved out.

Edit: This cat comment - 100% a joke. [Here's a screenshot of the actual ""rules"" I asked of him](https://imgur.com/a/beOzwvD). We used to talk every day, before and after we moved in. It was hard to adjust, but this was tame compared to the shit we said to each other.","YTA. I think you were unreasonable. If he was paying rent he's entitled to bring her round.

"AITA for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto FB who died during the 9/11 attacks?. I lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when TWC towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. 

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.""

A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here? I genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, I just wanted people to know what a great person my late-GF was.","YTA but very gently.

 Hear me out. As someone who has also lost a significant other, I totally understand where you're coming from. She was a big part of your life for a time, and those events obviously shaped you into who you are today. I'm sure you think of her often. It's entirely possible to fully love your wife, and still miss your ex. That said, I think you could've worded your post differently to be just a bit more sensitive to your wife. Something along the lines of ""remembering you today"" rather than ""I will always miss you"" would've relayed the same sentiment, without making your wife feel like you're pining after a past love. 

Other commentators are saying that your wife is insecure, which she might be, but it's a difficult situation for her to be in. She might logically understand that jealousy or insecurity over a dead woman is completely irrational, but that doesn't stop her from feeling that emotion. I've done the same dance with my current partner. I'd advise you to offer her some reassurance, and keep an open dialogue about your feelings and your ex with her, if you don't already.",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for not giving up a parking spot?. The plan: Me and my boyfriend were gonna meet our friend Kevin at this Halal food place. He lives about 10 minute walk from there and we have to drive about 15 minutes to get there. So we planned on texting him to start walking once we are close so that we would arrive at the same time.           
                   The parking: At Halal, there are only 3 free parking spaces(side by side) that open up to the street. There's this really big truck, then a large open space, and a sedan in the last parking space. You need to jump the curb a bit to get to the open space. To the left of the truck, there is this sports car awkwardly squeezed in a triangular space with half of it on the sidewalk.         
                    The confrontation: A woman, is standing in the middle of the open parking space talking on their phone. I have a big car so I can take this cirb. I make my turn and immediately this woman walks closer to my car and motions me to stop. In this instance I've got my first wheel over the curb and my back wheels still on the street, so I motion her to get out of the way. I'm annoyed. So, I gas it so my car moves a foot and the lady finally understands to move and then I get the parking spot. My bf texts Kevin where he is(2mins away). We decide to wait in the car for him. The woman on her phone starts to talk really loudly about us. ""They aren't even getting out of the car."" ""They are just on their phone."" Nothing mean, she is just annoyed. We thought this was pretty funny so we just started to purposely laugh really hard to see if she would say anything else about us. In my mind, no one is entitled to a parking space unless their car is there. You can't place your body there and reserve it, so the very fact this woman was mad over something ridiculous was funny. Then, after a minute, she walks up to the driver's side(me) and knocks on my window. I'm new to this type of confrontation, so I at first refused to roll my window down. I didnt know if she was gonna hurt me, spit on me, or something. So then she started saying ""roll you're window down"" and I said ,""You can talk to me like this"" and she said ""I cant hear you."" So  I rolled it down. She basically started talking about how this parking is for people who want to eat at Halal, not to just chill and look at their phones. I tell her I'm entitled to this parking space as well and I dont have to tell her why I'm waiting, because it is non of her business. I roll my window up, wait for our friend to arrive which was exactly on time. We walked past that women, trying not to look at her, as we went into Halal.               They made it in eventually.                   
      I felt justified, and my bf supported me, but Kevin thought it was pretty rude. Obviously the sports car was trying to get into that spot without having to go over the curb and possibly scraping it, and the woman was just making sure no other car would get in the way. Idk how long they have been trying but I saw the space and took it.AITA?","When you purposely laughed at her with the goal of seeing if she would say something else about you you were being an instigator.

"AITA For wanting to get rid of our cats?. We have two cats.  A year ago my wife wanted to get our daughter a cat since she loves the things and she is at an age where caring for a pretty low maintenance animal would teach her some responsibility. I didn't want to do it but in an effort of not being the bad guy, I let it go. A few months later, my mother and my daughter take in a stray that was hanging around her house which means we now have two cats. Now, I don't hate cats, I just don't want my own. The deal was that my daughter would be responsible for keeping food and water available and scooping their little boxes. All was fine initially until she no longer wanted to do the work and it became a fight every time she was reminded it needed to be done. Along with that, despite having (hideous) covers, our nice leather couches are now shredded, I have had to replace countless cords due to being chewed on, my home theater system was ruined when they knocked the humidifier off the table onto the subwoofer, the subfloor in my kitchen is ruined because they flipped over the water bowl within minutes of us leaving for a couple of days and one of them has a habit of peeing on things. All together with the cost of the furniture (if I were to replace it) vet bills for the peeing, replacing and repairing electronics, and what it will cost to replace the floor, I would say in less than a year, this little endeavor of teaching our daughter responsibility has/will cost me well over $10k and there is no end in sight. As I type this, one just chewed through the cord to the Echo I was listening to music on. I want to re-home these cats but I'm being made out to be the bad guy whereas my wife just looks at it with nothing but apathy and says things like ""well the damage is already done, \[daughter\] will be really upset if they have to go.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR, having cats has caused well over $10k in damage to my home and possessions and I want them gone. Im being made out as the bad guy because no one else seems to see this as an issue.

Edit 2: One commenter said something about ""the right cat"". One of the cats was a barn cat for the first 6 months of his life and the other was an outside stray for an unknown amount of time. Perhaps they're just not inside house cats and there isn't anything that can really be done about that and none of us foresaw the potential issues that would come with them.



Conclusion: After reading all the comments and answering a few questions, it seems a couple of things are pretty clear. We got two cats which my wife and I are and were fully prepared to do a considerable amount of the care for while having our daughter be responsible for them since she loves cats and this could have been an opportunity for her to learn more responsibility. As they were outside cats prior to coming here, we did not realize the potential issues of taking an outside animal and making it live inside all the time. The best course of action going forward in my opinion based on what you have all said is to find them a home more suitable for their personalities where they can be wild as they are at heart without the restriction of being confined to the indoors. Letting them be outside animals is not an option as we love in town and most of our neighbors have dogs and I worry that they may be run over by a car. It's been a learning experience for us and I think everyone involved will be better off with such a change.","YTA. A cat is a big responsibility, if you agreed a while ago that you could have one, you should respect that. It's a pet, not a piece of furniture you can discard. Teach some discipline to your daughter so she will look after it like agreed, cat-proof your house, don't leave your cats for "" a couple of days"" and expect to find a spotless house when you come back and make sure your cats have something to scratch (a wood log will do). I find it hard to believe they would cause so much damage if the house is equipped for them. My cats are not perfect, they scratch my sofa and knock things off tables despite having plenty of games and wood to scratch on, but 10k worth of damage in a year?!",1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for insisting on a lunch break making someone else wait 45min for the next bus?. Our school offers an option to take in-depth classes in social and natural sciences in English to get a second degree simultaneously while working towards the German Abitur, which enables you to work in an English speaking country without participating in a language exam first. This course is pretty expensive (300-400€ I think), however there's a perpetration year at a lower cost to see if it's what you are going for. This includes after school lessons in biology and history taught in English to get the basics that go beyond ""normal"" English you're taught in English classes.

A normal day for older students in Germany consists of lessons from 8 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., two 15 minute breaks included. (Sometimes it's 45 minutes less). Then most days another 15 minute break and one period free time for lunch to be followed by 1-3 more classes à 45 minutes.

As I took the prep course the first year it was offered, we were only four students in total and allowed to decide when we wanted the 1.5 hours of history in English to take place. After 6 periods I wanted to have lunch so I proposed to stick to the normal schedule and take the 7th period off, totalling 1 hour. However, one other girl came from a town and a half over and had to take bus only going once an hour after 2 p.m.. She wanted to shorten that to 15 min. or have no break at all;  with a reasonable break she'd have to wait ~45min for the next bus. She argued that I could just get something at the bakery, this would at the most take 10 minutes, I mentioned she could spend the time in the library studying or literally anywhere as the school is in the middle of the town.

Legally I'm in the right, schools are required to grant students a reasonable lunch break after six periods (or something along those lines) and she did budge after a few weeks knowing I could only choose to voluntarily give up my lunch break. But AITA for insisting on ""real"" lunch? (Like most Germans, my family eats a warm meal for lunch with something like a slice of bread for dinner. It's not unusual and the reason for the lunch rule. Giving up lunch would mean no full meal that day.)","NAH.

You both had different opinions on how to schedule.

So right now I am having troubles with my studies which are not going very well. I put off assignments for the last minute and everything piled up and I fell into depression because of it. Felt so hopless that for once I talked to him about my feelings, that I'm depressed and really need his help.

For a while it seemed great. I felt better, he started pushing me to stop putting things off and just do it.

So I had a big project to do until Monday, so I put all my time and energy into it, but really made a mess in our appartment. Didn't do my dishes which I put in the sink, trash and clothes all over my room.

He got fed up with it and confronted me and we had a fight. He said that I should clean after myself and if I can't do that because of my studies, maybe I should've studied earlier. I said that it's too late for that and I have to work hard while theres still time. I have helped him countless times and this is the one time that I really needed his help and support.

"AITA for spending more money on a car for my son then my daughter.

"AITA for not allowing my parents to see my children until they apologize for disrespecting me?. My sister’s family live in the same city as mine. My parents take their child 2-3 weeks every 3 months to their home 12 hours away so sister and brother in law can “relax.” My parents drop everything to drive to babysit anytime my sister goes on a trip. I am a single parent who travels for work, but my parents are busy watching my sister’s kid whenever I’ve asked them to babysit mine. 

There is tension between my parents and I because I don’t send my kids alone to visit them partially because my parents are caring for my alcoholic uncles and grandmother with advanced dementia. It gets a little chaotic at their home and I don’t think my kids can handle it. (Their home is safe - just unpredictable.)


I found out this morning my parents are bringing my nephew home early. I have to travel to my company’s headquarters 3 hours away tomorrow morning. I called to ask if there was any chance they wanted to babysit so they get time with their grandkids and I don’t have to use a sitter.

My mom says “Sure what time!?” When I say I have to be on the road by 6AM she says “Oh. That’s really early. Your sister’s house has alarms so if I open the door it will wake everyone up. Your kids will wake up the whole household. It’s just not going to work.”

I was flabbergasted. I reminded her this is the ONLY thing I have ever asked and they drive everywhere for my sister’s kid but they can get up early for my kids? (BTW the alarm thing is totally bunk. You just disarm it like any other alarm. My parents could have come to my house to watch the kids, there are a million solutions here.) My Dad chimes in “You try driving all day and see if you wanna get up at 6AM to babysit!”

I tell them to forget it. They backpeddle and offer to get the kids after they’ve ‘woken up and had coffee.’ I said ‘nah. If they’re so put out, I’ll just stick with my original plan.’ My dad goes OFF on how I’m so dramatic and I always have to start problems and cussing me out exposing everything I’ve done to annoy him over the years (I had no idea about half of it!) It was uncalled for so I just hung up.

They tried texting me and copy my partner on the text saying “We’ll pick the kids up tomorrow afternoon, we love you.” I replied very politely but firmly, it isn’t about not being up to watching my kids so early, it’s that they made my kids sound like burdens and their language toward me was uncalled for. I said until there is a sincere apology for the tirade and name calling, my family will not make plans to visit them while they’re here. 

AITA for standing my ground on this one? 

TL;DR My parents regularly drive 12 hrs each way to watch my sister’s kid. I asked if they can babysit for a day. They said no because it was “too early” plus lame excuses. I called them out and my dad cussed me out.

They said no, that they'd be in contact with said neighbor, and that if the issue continues to call animal control. A week or so later the landlord gets back to me and tells me the neighbor told them that the dog would only be on the premises ""for the next 3 weeks"", and that ""it only seems to bark when \[he's\] at work"". This was on November 14th of 2019. Now not only has the howling and barking not stopped it sounds like they now have another dog on the premises. This is getting to the point that it is affecting my ability to work as one of my jobs is working from home.*** My roommates think I'm being a b\_tch and baked the neighbor some muffins, I'm assuming to ""smooth things over"". But, this is getting out of control and I can't take these games anymore. I'm planning on calling animal control this week ***per the landlord's advice***. AITA?","INFO: did you make any attempt to discuss this with your neighbor?

"AITA for not wanting to “help” my cousin on homework. Hi reddit I have a cousin who has to do a MOCK interview with someone in a certain field of work which I coincidently happen to be in. I indeed try to help this kid once but I literally ended up doing the kids homework as many of the questions were not focused on what I specifically do and helped her do research.

AITA??","YTA. You’re the adult. Set boundaries and say “I’m not going to do this whole project for you, but I have 45 minutes and will give you my undivided attention for that entire time to answer any questions you have.”

Everyone is busy. This kid probably looks up to you, even if you don’t realize it, and besides - it’s family. Just take the 45 minutes to sit down with the kid. If it goes longer then you know you need to set a limit and it’s your problem that you’re letting him steamroll you.

"AITA for telling my friend to stop her achievements?. Basically, my best friend and I are seniors in high school. She’s gotten inducted into the National Honor’s Society, gotten recognized in the school’s “thespian hall of fame” of sorts,  and is looking at a full ride to a really nice college. She’s naturally gorgeous, smart, and strong. She never has to study. I, on the other hand, have to work my butt studying to make B’s and C’s and wear as much makeup as Beyonce and buy a bunch of expensive beauty products to at least look presentable.

We went out recently and she’s been talking about nothing but the stuff mentioned above. While we were eating it didn’t stop, and finally I told her that if she didn’t start talking about something else, I will be leaving and taking my car home and she would have to find another ride home. She got silent and asked for us to leave after we ate. It wasn’t until too long ago that I got messages from her saying that she was breaking off our contact until I “sorted my life out” and “decided to start supporting her”.

"WIBTA if I completely refused to participate in the family Easter lunch in order to bury our pet?. It's Easter, and my (24M) fiance (23F) and I were invited to my family's Easter lunch. My aunt and uncle and a few cousins are coming from out of town. Since I work 12 hour night shifts, I was originally going to pop in and say hi to everyone on my way home from work and then go home to sleep.

&#x200B;

However, last night I got a call from my fiance as soon as I got to work that our beloved rat of almost 5 years (*extremely old for a rat*) had passed away. It wasn't much of a surprise but we were still extremely upset. We want to bury him in my parents backyard next to his cage-mate who passed almost a year ago, and the only chance to do that is in the hour long window between when I get off my job and my fiance has to go into hers. This also happens to be right when everyone will be there sitting down for lunch.

&#x200B;

We recently had an extremely traumatizing experience regarding family and death that we are both still trying to recover from, but that's a [whole other story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/b7bpam/mil_seemingly_contributes_to_husbands_suicide/) Fiance told me that she didn't want to interact with anyone and just wanted to have a quick burial in peace, and I definitely agreed. We will be sleep deprived, depressed, and in a rush to get to work on time and just don't have the energy for fake pleasantries with extended family.

&#x200B;

I texted my mother asking to explain to the family to give us space and not be offended, but she texted back that I was being rude, and that I should at least pop in for 30 seconds and say hi to everyone while Fiance waits in the car. I told her I would definitely not make Fiance wait in the car for a meaningless 30 second interaction that would more realistically take at least 10 minutes, and made it clear to her that we would not be disturbed in any way, including being stared at or waved to through the window, and that this was far from a happy social occasion for us, as we are both sleep deprived, grieving, and working overtime on a holiday. I got a one letter response and now I feel guilty on top of everything else.

&#x200B;

I just want to bury my poor rat, take Fiance to work, go home and sleep without people thinking we're rude or making them angry. Am I being unreasonable?

&#x200B;

tl;dr - I need to bury our pet at my parents house during family lunch, was told I was expected to interact with family, said no and was told I was being rude/disrespectful. What do?

&#x200B;



Just for some added context, after an extremely violent and traumatic event we experienced (the relationship advice post I linked) we were urged by therapist to ""tread lightly"" regarding family matters so I was trying to heed the professional advice and put our mental health first while at the same time trying not to offend my family. We latched onto the rat after the suicide and were using him like an emotional crutch so it really felt more like the loss of another family member, not ""just a rat"". I think it was worth being an asshole in the end; it all worked out. Happy Easter to those who celebrate.","YTA if you go to your parents house while they're home at any time for any reason and don't at least pop in for a hello.

"AITA For attempting to intervene in my friends' marriages?. These guys were my lifelong friends growing up but now they are married with kids (some not by choice), which leaves me by myself most days.  I miss the days we hung out together as a group, and sadly those days seem to be over.

"AITA for being annoyed that my roommate rearranged my food. I live with three roommates, so there are four of us total. This morning I got up and my entire shelf in the fridge was moved so it was only a few inches away from the top of the fridge and all of my food had been rearranged. I sent a group text to my roommates because I wasn't sure who'd done it, and all I said was that I didn't appreciate my things being moved without asking, especially since it put my bags of lettuce right under the coldest part of the fridge, which makes it spoil faster.

My roommate who had moved everything came home after that text and confronted me, saying that it's ridiculous for me to be angry about her moving my stuff and she'd only moved it because she and her bf/our other roommate had gone grocery shopping and needed more space for their things, and that my text was passive aggressive. I don't think it was passive aggressive when I clearly stated what the problem was instead of like sulking or re-rearranging the fridge.

I tried to explain that I wasn't angry, it just feels jarring to wake up and have a bunch of your stuff rearranged. Her stance is that she shouldn't have to fucking ask me to move things in the fridge, especially because she and bf are two people and I'm only one person. And she made the point to say it was ""more organized"" once she was done with it.

She also said that as she was reorganizing things she knew it would probably bother me, and she shouldn't have to feel anxious about moving things in her own apartment. I really don't get why she didn't just ask me if she knew it would bother me, and I still feel like it's a reasonable thing to be annoyed about because I would never just rearrange her things without asking.

So, am I being an over-sensitive asshole?

**Editing to say:** thanks for all of the feedback so far. It definitely has made me reconsider my stance on things and I set up a time this afternoon to talk with my roommate so I can apologize and just generally clear the air between us once we've both had some time to cool off.","YTA. It's reaaally not a big deal lol. Living in a house with 4 other people is tough sometimes, and fridge space is precious. Merely rearranging it to allow for more stuff to fit is okay.

"AITA for telling my wife she is imagining she is pregnant because of her new ssri medication. me 34 and my wife 35 have been married for 10 years and have 3 kids, after our last child my wife sarah got the mirena coil so we cant have any more kids, after our last sarah developed postnatal depression,  she managed it well but doctors recently started her on ssris ( cutalopram)our youngest is now 19 months old.

i know what she's like when shes pregnant, ive seen her pregnant 4 times,  one child sadly ended in miscarriage, but she is claiming she can feel something moving deep in her uterus and she claims its not the strange after birth flutters

she says when she puts her hand to her belly she can feel strange thumping movements that come and go.

so being practical,  as she has the coil and had a coil ultrasound check 2 weeks ago i decided to be logical about it and told her its probably her meds messing with her head, not being mean but it could easily be that. 

so she grabbed my hand and made me feel her belly,  admittedly i can feel it too, its like very very faint kicking but i reassured her its just spasms or gas wich Made her more angry and she screamed that at her age  she knows what fucking gas feels like but i think it may feel different because of her brain meds.


at this point she burst in to tears and called me a dick saying i was calling her crazy when i said no such thing! its all in her head and im getting all the blame for what's most likely gas! so reddit aita??","In this case, YTA.

"AITA for trying to talk some sense into my friend?. This is really long and I'm sorry lol.

My best friend of almost 6 years is obese. She's about the same height as me (5'4 - 5'5) and has to weigh about 3 and change, if not, close. (Not meant to sound derogatory at all). 

She's into this whole ""lose weight quick"" BS and has been very interested in taking diet pills again. These diet pills specifically, keep your appetite down, boost your metabolism and give you energy. Which sounds sketchy as fuck to begin with, but I let it go for the sake of the conversation. So instead of just instantly preaching to her about diet pills, I just slid in some suggestions like eating healthier (which she doesn't do) and working out a little bit, even if it's just taking a walk around the block. 

She just excused it off with ""I get enough exercise at the hospital lol"" (she's a patient sitter). Then continues with how she wants to get down to at least 130, so she'll take them for awhile and then quit so that she doesn't (quote) ""get too dependent on them."" This set off immediate red flags, so I said ""And that's why I don't mess with them."" 

Completely excuses it with ""but bruh imma be skinny af tho"" (yes she said it like that) ""like dude can you imagine how awesome imma look at about 130 or less?"" So I responded with something like ""And how shitty you're gonna feel physically? :D"" 

""lol actually probably feel the same, just skinny af."" 

This is where I sent her how I felt about it. I basically said that what's the point of being skinny if you're just going to feel horrible? Nobody knows how those things are going to make her feel a couple months down the road. She really is not taking her health into consideration, she's more worried about how good she's going to look. Losing weight should always be about your health and well being, not the fact that it may make you ""skinny af."" I ended it with saying that I'm not trying to tell her what to do because it's a free country and she can do what she wants, but I don't want her getting hurt or depriving herself of anything she needs.

Of course she excuses it again with ""I know, mom always watches me when I'm on them anyway to make sure I'm taking them right, so."" I just stopped the conversation right there and didn't escalate it further. She's so damn hard-headed sometimes. I really am concerned for her and would love to help her but she just keeps making these excuses and brushing off the suggestions and risk factors. I 100% agree that being skinny can be beautiful and raise your confidence, but at what expense? Your health? I just don't know what to do anymore.

As someone with depression, letting other people know about it is a *huge* deal. You feel ashamed at yourself and embarrassed for other people to know.

"WIBTA if I tell my 37 year old coworker that one of our student staff guessed that she was 44 years old?. So I’m 34 and I work in higher education.  I manage a staff of RAs and there are only 3 people total in my position at this university (it’s a small department).  For some reason, one of my coworkers who is in the same role as me has been comparing herself to me in a negative way recently.  A week or two ago she told me she “looked younger than me” apropos of absolutely nothing.  I just let it go, but happened to be at dinner with my staff a few days after she said that and mentioned in conversation how I only came out when I was around 30; some of them looked surprised because they didn’t think I was even 30 years old yet—they guessed I was around 28.

So I asked them, how old do you think [coworker] is?  And one of them said “44?”  Of course, I decided this wasn’t something I should tell her.  Until this morning.  

She comes in and starts talking to me about stuff and I’m cleaning my glasses and complaining about how the lenses always seem dirty no matter how much I clean them.  She says, “Well it’s because they’re too big for your face and you’re always pushing them up.” (I push them up using the bridge or the edges, but okay whatever.)  And then she starts talking about some fugly frames I should get instead that “go out at the edges” and I was like, yeah those just really aren’t my style.  And she said, “well those frames are just too big for your face and they make you look 45.”

I’m sorry, what?  I replied, “I respectfully disagree, as people usually guess my age around 28 or so.”  Eventually she dropped it and went to her office, but it seems like a pattern of her comparing herself to me to cut me down is forming and if she brings up how she “looks younger than me” or how “old I look” again, I’m tempted to tell her that a student guessed her age at 44 to get her to shut up about it.

"AITA for buying my dream guitar? My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.. I've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. 

I just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. 

My fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot.

"WIBTA if I specifically asked my best man to let the other members of my bridal party plan my bachelor party instead of him?. So choosing a best man has been really hard for me. I had a best friend for 15+ years that was definitely going to be my best man that has completely cut me off after he cheated on his girlfriend and she asked me about it, and I was caught between a rock and a hard place when she approached me and asked if he did or not. 

Besides him, I have another close friend who I was his best man. This friend got married and had kids right after high school, so while we were close then, when I went off to college and started to party more and go to bars and clubs and such, he never experienced that as he has always been with his family. He’s still an extremely close friend, and who I’m picking to be my best man, but his ideal “guys night” or party would be grabbing a case of beer, staying in and playing video games and poker, which is not me at all.  Additionally, with him becoming a young father, anything more than the get together described, would be a huge financial burden on him, and I don’t want him to go through that.

"WIBTA of I skipped my boyfriend's son's game because the kiddo doesn't like us kissing?. Dating for 1.5 years, both divorced with our own kids. We do not live together. Kiddo is 9. I've spent a ton of time with him over this last year +, but I feel like the kid has always held me at arms length because his mom, the ex wife, is a horrible, vindictive narcissist who belittles me and my boyfriend to this kid, and has made it very hard for the kid to just feel normal and happy about his dad being in a relationship.

As more background... Ex wife has repeatedly texted boyfriend that the kid tells her we're disgusting cause we kiss in front of him. She's told boyfriend that he's a horrible dad because he's too focused on his girlfriend (me) and it's obvious because we kiss each other in front of the kids. Furthermore, boyfriend had a very hard time standing up to her /establishing boundaries with her. It took him a very long time to realize she's full of shit, and even today, he second guesses himself when she hits the right nerve (cause the harassment texts are quite routine, and she's always finding a new way to tell him he's a horrible dad).

Today, kiddo tells his dad that he's uncomfortable with me coming to his sporting event this weekend as planned (and as I've done many times before), because one, mom will be there (and lord knows she's been very ugly about these situations in the past) and two, he's uncomfortable that we kiss in front of him and his friends.

Boyfriend texted me and says.... When you come tomorrow, we can't kiss as much.

My gut feelings light up. Which I'm learning to listen to.

I know this is cause of horrible, vindictive mom.

I say... Wouldn't it be appropriate for you to talk to him about being uncomfortable with this, acknowledge his feelings, but then let him know that we're gonna continue to be us because kissing someone you love is natural and normal? Furthermore, mom shows absolutely ZERO affection in her relationship (she's newly gay, but isn't out yet to the kids, they have no idea that moms live in, sharing a bedroom ""friend"" is anything but that), wouldn't you like your kid to learn from somewhere that affection is a good thing? Plus... We all know this is coming from the ex anyway, cause she makes it so damn hard in this kid... Why can't we just be us?

He says... I know it's coming from mom, I just wanna take it easy on him.

I'm hurt. I'm hurt that yet again, the ex is in the way, and now she's dictating, through her kid, when I can and cannot touch my boyfriend.

I'm considering just skipping the game. WIBTA?

ETA:

You all make very valid points. I appreciate you not taking it easy on me. I came here for feedback, and I definitely got it. Thank you.

A few things, in no particular order:

1. This isn't one sided. BF is just as affectionate with me as I would be with him.

2. We certainly don't make out in front of the kids. At previous kid events like this in the past, if we arrived separately (we live a ways apart and sometimes things are in the middle), I'd greet my boyfriend with a peck. Something along those lines. Or if he went to the concession stand, and he handed me a snack, it might also be with a peck. That's what we're talking about.

3. The kiddo certainly has it hard. There aren't enough reddit words to describe how hard this kid's life is. He has a little brother, too, that he feels responsible for on some level, so this is tough. I have no interest in making it harder for him.

4. I know I'm sensitive to affection being demonstrated, as none was modeled for me in my childhood, and I feel like I'm worse off for it. Maybe that's why I need help here... I don't know.

5. I also know I'm sensitive to the ex' involvement in our relationship. It's been a constant struggle for us. It's gotten better, by miles, but my heart races when her meddling influences us somehow.

6. I have a therapist, and I ask her all this stuff too, and she won't take it easy on me either, but that appt is a few weeks away yet.

7. I considered skipping to just ease the stress on the kids, and because that was kiddo's initial request anyway. Not because I can't resist touching my boyfriend, but because maybe it's easier if I just stay outta the way. Boyfriend pressed a bit to find out why kiddo didn't want me there, when he'd previously been excited about it, and had asked me to come to other events in the past, and that's when he got the ""cause mom will be there too (she was not at a number of events I was at last winter, so he didn't have to worry about us crossing paths), plus... Kissing."" We've honestly had a hard time deciding which things I should go to and which I shouldn't (I really am invited, by the boyfriend), because according to mom, I'm not allowed at any event, ever, regardless of boyfriend or kid wishes. 

8. When were at the same events, we do not sit together. Mom does not acknowledge me, hasnt said two words to me, really ever. There isn't any sort of blow up or anything, but certainly the kids pick up on the tension. I don't attempt small talk with her as I feel that might make it worse for all involved. Maybe I'm wrong. At these things, I'm thrilled to sit with my bf, or on my own if he's coaching. I bring gum and sunflower seeds and cheer for them. The kids will come chat with me and ask if I saw that play or whatever, but only if mom isn't there (she misses a fair amount of stuff). If mom is there, the kids steer very clear of me. 

9. I know that I have a tendency to just disappear when I'm hurt. I'm not saying it's healthy, or wise, but that's an old vestige that I guess I'm still working on.

I can still accept judgment though, thank you.","YTA.  100%. If you can’t stop kissing your SO for the length of a sports game so the people around you aren’t uncomfortable, you have some major issues.

"AITA for breaking off a friendship with a guy friend who wasn't into me?. I've been kind of grappling with this ever since a couple weeks ago I had broken off a friendship with a guy I liked who didn't like me back.  

We would see each other almost every day and it was getting to the point where it was uncomfortable for me to be around him so much. I felt like we were emotionally dating, and I didn't want to keep lying to myself. 

I was fine with being friends with him after the rejection, but not being \*best friends\* with him, which I felt like we were for some time. 

I finally said I needed some space and he took it really hard. The rejected part of me was like ""to hell with him,"" but as a friend, I felt bad.

He hasn't really been reaching out to our mutual friends and I'm afraid he's going to isolate himself. I told him I didn't mind hanging out in a group, but he kept saying he wouldn't show up to any group hangouts (which I said was not at all necessary). I was really the only one who consistently said ""yes"" to his requests to hang out. He's lost a good friend of his, but I'm doing much better emotionally as I have other close friends to rely on.

"AITA for covertly recording the conversations I have with coworkers/boss?. For the past year or so, I have gotten into a habit of regularly covertly recording conversations I have with coworkers and my superiors at work. I just use my mobile phone. 

I usually don't end up reviewing the recordings, but if it turns out to be a heated/high stakes discussion, I do find them useful sometimes, and I \*never\* share the recordings with anyone (this would implicate me, obviously). 

It's a practice I started in my last job, which was a pretty toxic work environment. I would have meetings that I experienced as going really well, and then later hear indirect reports from others that the meetings went terribly. 

After this happened a number of times, I felt like I was going crazy, so out of desparation I sneakily recorded the conversations so I could listen back to them later, and have a bit more of an objective view of how they went. Not so I could prove it to anyone else that I communicated well, but just so I could prove to myself. 

I'm in a new job now, and things are much better, but I still do it occassionally. I don't share the recordings, but I am recording my coworkers without their consent. AITA?",What you’re doing is possibly illegal.,1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for kicking off on my boyfriend because my phone said he’s on another line but he’s lying about it? Or so I think?. I’m a 25F and I’m in a relationship with my 26M let’s call him J. We have a child together and next week getting our own place. Anyway, I let him use my phone which is an iPhone for work because he said he was bored on the morning and his is broke. He contacts me through my sisters phone since we live with her while he’s at work.

Anyway I rang him this morning and it said this person is on another line. I thought this was weird, who does he know off my contact list? Once he answered I asked him about it and he claimed that he wasn’t on the phone to anyone. I thought it was weird but let it go, I mean why would he lie about it? 

Anyway at one I rang again to give him news on our new home and again it said he was on another line. I rang again a minute later and it rang normal again but he didn’t answer. I admit, I got a little hot headed here and said who are you talking to and why are you lying about it? He read the message but didn’t answer. I tried ringing again and again it rang like normal. 

I started getting a little upset. I was happy about the house but this made me feel like he was acting a little shady. He phoned me about an hour later, kicking off saying he wasn’t on the phone all that time and that it was locked away cause he’s on a chemical plant and they don’t allow them. 

So what the hell? I said who read my message then, he claimed he didn’t see no message. Am I being a psycho here? I feel like one.

"AITA for refusing to compensate or credit my friend in a film that’s loosely based on his childhood trauma?. 
Using a throwaway because it’s   possible to figure out my identity if I post on my main account. (However, I am in no way famous and have yet to achieve any form of mainstream success with my work). 

I recently made a low-budget indie film that is loosely inspired by some childhood trauma a friend of mine experienced. He’s confided in me slowly about these events throughout the years. I found his story to be tragic but also extremely interesting from a creative perspective. (I should note that my friend is not a writer and, as far as I know, he has little to no interest in the arts). 

The film is now done, with the exception of some last minute edits that need to be made. All names of people, places, etc. have been changed. The dialogue is entirely my own, and so are nearly all of the details. Still, given my source of inspiration, I asked my friend to be among the first to view the film. I kept the plot a surprise, which I admit was a precarious decision. Thankfully, he loved it and provided only positive feedback after the viewing. However, a few days later—I believe, after speaking with someone about it—his attitude changed significantly. 

My friend has now requested (1) some form of credit in the film’s opening lines and (2) a small percentage of the profits. (I have no idea what #2 would look like even if I agreed, since calculating profits can be an extremely complicated endeavor. There is also a significant chance that there will be no profits to distribute. However, I suppose we could come to some agreement about compensation, if I were so inclined). 

I happen to have several lawyers in my family. I am confident that, based on the specific circumstances at play here, I have no legal obligation to accommodate either of my friends requests. At least for now, this is a moral issue rather than a legal one. (I am sure some could make arguments about the legalities but I am **not** looking for legal advice at this time, and I would not post in this forum for that purpose, in any case). 

What I am wondering is - do I have some moral duty to oblige my friend’s requests for acknowledgement and/or money?

Thank you in advance for any responses.","YTA. You’re lucky he wasn’t furious in the first place— you took his incredibly private disclosures and because you found it ‘creatively interesting’ you exploited him for personal gain without permission. The least you can do is credit him as he asks.

Not to mention that not disclosing the plot to him and just letting him be surprised by it while watching could have been severely triggering and re-traumatizing.

"AITA for calling myself 'poor' when my family has a lot of money?. So I was texting some people in a groupchat earlier today and the topic turned to fashion/shoes. The thing is that I'm actually pretty into dressing nice, and especially with shoes. My parents are fairly wealthy (both doctors), but they're also pretty stereotypical Asian parents: they see buying hyped up shoes as a waste of money, don't give me an allowance, and so on. So technically I have a net worth of $0. 

Anyhow, I texted that 'I would be a sneakerhead if I had money but I'm poor so...'. Most people in the groupchat either just responded with 'lol' or something like that, or agreed. But one girl, let's call her Sarah, got a bit pissed off. Btw, she's not poor, she lives in my neighborhood, and her mom  works with my dad.

She started going off about how 'You're not poor, you're rich' and 'you don't know what it's like to be poor' and so on and so forth. To this, I responded that 1) To a certain extent, yes, I did grow up pretty comfortably, but I have a net worth of $0. Which is literally poor. Besides, I don't have any money of my own, so I'm not rich, my parents are. And besides, she's taking a casual text way too seriously.

AITA for yelling at an employee for following me around at Macy’s?. This happened yesterday and I don’t know if I was in the wrong or not. I (24 F) was at Macy’s shopping for a perfume for my mom. When I was there I noticed an employee who would alway get a bit closer to me when I would go to a different aisle. At first I didn’t think much of it and just continued looking around. What started to piss me off was when she kept asking if “I needed help” or “if I found anything I liked” every five minutes. I would alway give her a fake smile and just walk away somewhere else. I decided to look at the Mac makeup for a bit and there she was again pretending to clean around the makeup aisles. At this point I had enough and asked her if she had a problem. She looked at me confused and asked me what I meant. At this point I started raising my voice at her and told her that she needs to stop following me around and if she thought I was stealing from the store. She looked at me scared and said “sorry” before she ran off. I told my friend about this and she told me that it’s their job to ask customers “if they needed any help” and that I was a major bitch.

"AITA for using someone else's trashcan?. So I usually take my dog for hour long walks/runs throughout the week. Sometimes while we are out, the dog needs to releave herself in a random yard. I always carry poop bags, and always make sure to pick up after her. The issue is, if we are only 20 minutes into an hour walk, I will throw the poop bag into a trashcan. The neighborhoods we run through all have those large green rolling trashcans, and most people keep them outside. I'll pick up the poop, and toss it in the next trashcan I see. I don't imagine I use the same trashcan more than once every few weeks. 

Today, while out for a walk, someone came out of their house yelling at me. I stopped, and he told me I was ""un-cool"" for using his trash, and to piss off, saying he had me on  camera. I admit, being taken aback, I told him ""fine, next time if she poops in your yard, I'll just leave it there"" and walked off.

"AITA for not wanting to go eat out for my girlfriend’s sister’s birthday because it’s a raid day in a video game I play?. This happened today. I meet with my Final Fantasy 14 raid group every Tuesday’s and Thursday’s from 5 - 8 pm. I work until 4 pm those days so after work I usually go straight home and get ready for the raid. My girlfriend knows this and she respects my schedule. I get a text from my girlfriend around 1 pm out of the blue while I’m at work asking if I want to eat out for her sister’s birthday (she turns 19) at a Korean bbq restaurant. I assumed it would be this weekend or something but she said it would be today at 5 pm. I remind her that I have the whole raid thing today and suggest this Friday or the weekend instead (plus I already ate and didn’t really feel like going to a buffet). Turns out my girlfriend has work those days and said TODAY is her sister’s birthday (implying we should do something special today because it’s her actual, actual birthday).

We find out the restaurant closes at 11 pm so we decided cool how about we make reservations for 8:30 pm. Perfect, it’ll be after the raid and everyone’s happy. Everything’s fine and dandy for a bit then she texts me back 20 min later and says birthday girl has work at 7 pm TODAY (of course...) I said well you guys can go at the original planned time of 5 pm without me. She asks if I can take a day off from the raid group. I said I would have if I knew ahead of time (a day at the very least), not literally the day of, 3 hours until the raid. (My group would have to find a replacement for the day, I would feel like an asshole, and also I’m their main source of DPS so they’re not going to be clearing shit without me). She says okay fine and that it’ll just be her and her sister there. I offered to send her money to pay for both her sisters but she said it was okay.

She then texts me about how the game is more important to me blah blah and goes on a rant. Now, it’s important to note that I’ve been playing this game excessively lately (new expansion and all that jazz) so we have had a few conversations about how I’m playing too much and that sometimes I don’t give her much attention (we don’t live together btw). I’ve acknowledged this and did make changes for the better. Now I want to clarify it’s nothing like I play 24/7, don’t shower or bathe, don’t take care of myself etc. I work full time week days and I usually play when I get home until I sleep. And I play a majority of the day on my days off on the weekend if we’re not doing anything together. But I make sure to spend time with her once or twice a week whether it be watching a movie, going on trips, shopping, etc and give her my attention when we’re on the phone.

I feel like I’m not in the wrong for not wanting to go because of the raid obligation and especially when it’s on such short notice, but sort of do because I’m choosing to playing a video game over spending time with her and her sister for her birthday, + my recent history of playing the game excessively I would like more opinions on the matter.

"AITA for shooting too much at the range with my wife. Basically to sum it up, we both took turns shooting the 22lr. I asked if I could use my Glock. She said okay. I’m still getting the feel of my Glock and handguns in general and ended up spending 25 minutes meticulously working on my aim, posture, and trigger pull. I used 55 rounds out of 100 and left her 45 to wrap the visit up. She refused, said I forgot what Mother’s Day was about, stormed out, left me to clean up all the casings and carry all of our shit out.

"AITA for telling a scary story to my girlfriend's little cousin?. Last night my girlfriend was at her house and babysitting her young 5 year old cousin. Her parents and aunt and uncle were out for the night and she invited me over so that we could spend some time together whilst watching out for her cousin. I won't divulge his real name, but let's just call him Timmy. Timmy was actually well behaved throughout the night. He put his own messes away, he politely asked when he wanted something, and he was just an all-around good kid. When it came time to tuck him in, he asked me and my girlfriend to tell him a scary story. My girlfriend's mind was a blank and I didn't have anything to offer, so I just decided to improvise and make something up on the spot.

I looked out the window and saw a streetlight and I got the idea to tell the story of a monster called the ""Bunyin"", a tall demon that disguises itself as streetlights during the day and spies on kids in the neighborhood to see which kids are bad and good. He doesn't do anything to the good kids, but when the bad kids are asleep, he drops the streetlight facade, reaches into their windows and takes them away to his underground lair. Timmy was noticeably creeped out, but I told him that he didn't have anything else to worry about since he was a good kid. We bid him goodnight and we hung out for a little while longer, but then Timmy starts screaming. We rush into his room and he's pointing outside his window...at a streetlight. He's crying and screaming ""BUNYIN! BUNYIN!"" We told him to calm down and that it was just a story, but he wouldn't settle down. My girlfriend told me that it was probably for the best if I left and I agreed.

Well, this morning I got called to my girlfriend's house and her parents and aunt and uncle were waiting for me and they didn't look happy. They asked if I told him a scary story about the Bunyin and I said yes. They told me that the story caused Timmy to flee the house early in the morning and they couldn't find him anywhere nearby. They were about to report him missing when one of their neighbors came by with Timmy in his car and he brought him home when he saw him running down the street. I immediately felt guilty about that part and my girlfriend's uncle was really letting me have it. He starts telling me that it would've been all my fault had Timmy been abducted while running away. I argued that Timmy wanted me to tell him a scary story in the first place, but they didn't want to hear it. They asked me to leave and never come near Timmy again.

Even my girlfriend made me feel like shit about it.

"WIBTA if I emailed a hiring manager to tell them best practices when phone screening candidates?. I just began job searching after 2 years at my current organization. 

I put in a resume at a local social service agency last week and got a call back two days later. The founder/president of the organization and I spoke for about 20 minutes and at the end she enthusiastically asked about my availability and said verbatim, “I’d like to have you come in for an interview.” 

I said my schedule was very flexible so she said she’d send me a few dates the same day via email. 

I usually email the person I spoke with to thank them for their time but opted to wait since she said she’d email me. No email came that day. Or the next day, or the next day. 

Finally on the third day I emailed thanking her for her time and asked, “please let me know if you’re still interested in setting up an in person interview.” She emailed back quickly saying “I will let you know.” I took that more as “I’ll let you know if I’m still interested,” not “I’ll let you know about my schedule.” Nothing else since then. 

It’s now been a week since the phone interview and I finally get a brief email saying that “you are not qualified.” I meet about 75% of their listing requirements.

I’m a hiring manager at my current position and conduct hiring every three-five months. I train my assistant, who handles phone screenings, to never tell someone that they would be getting an in-person interview, but that someone would be in touch if they are moving forward in the process, which I thought is standard. 

I feel like it was very unprofessional for her to ask my availability, tell me she wants me to interview, never reach out to me, and then give that short response when I email her. But at the same time, I understand that it’s her agency and she can do what she wants. 

My question is: would it be appropriate/worth it for me to email back to tactfully let them know that setting up an interview with someone and then changing their mind but not reaching back out isn’t best practice when hiring? Or should I just move on (I have already set up other interviews, but the whole situation is just so bizarre and unprofessional to me)?

"AITA for freaking out that my GF let the dog lick kitchen utensils.. Literally happened half an hour ago.

Background: we've large dog and are currently looking after a friend's small dog  for a couple of days.

Our dog would normally eat dry food, the small one has his own wet, kinda jelly food.

We were all in the kitchen and my GF was feeding the dogs. Large one got his food from a measuring cup and she used a table spoon to break down the jelly for the small dog.

All good up to that point, we were standing, talking and then she reached out to the big dog to let him lick the spoon.

I think it's disgusting, dogs eat poop, lick eachothers balls etc. Since you don't boil the kitchen utensils or plates I would never give them to the dog to lick.

I've asked why she was doing this, but she was surprised I had issues with it and carried on letting the dog lick the spoon.

I raised my voice quite significantly, trying to make her stop with very little reaction other than *why are you speaking to my like that*

Anyway she claims she's been doing this all her life and it's completely normal to do with wet dog food.

I think it's disgusting because the dog will kick it clean and leave his thick saliva all over the thing which is hard to remove and gross.

She stopped in the end, after the dog was done pretty much, and reluctantly agreed not to do it again. I took the spoon and washed it. While doing this and noticing the thick saliva thing I swore under my breath. She heard it and went into the bathroom in a huff.

I met her at a dive bar in Kyoto and we instantly clicked and bonded over how much we hate living in NYC.

On the day of my birthday party she gave me a Givenchy bag. I was very shocked, and so were my other friends, but I kindly accepted and put the gift in my bedroom because I didn’t want to cause a commotion or make her feel awkward. That night before she left the party, I pulled her to the side and expressed how grateful I am to have her in my life but I couldn’t accept the gift. She laughed and shrugged it off but I was being serious. She made it clear that she was not taking it back. 

I’ve never owned a designer bag, nor am I familiar with how expensive certain brands are so I looked up the price of the bag, my jaw dropped. $3500+ .. I know it’s a drop in the bucket for her but it just doesn’t feel right for me to accept such a pricey gift. I’m a broke bitch from Brooklyn. 

The next day I called her to meet up and brought the gift with me to return to her. I told her that I appreciated that she went out of her way to buy this purse but that I can’t accept it. She was not pleased... 

Am I the asshole?","YTA or nah because i think we can sympathize with you.

"AITA for planning to leave my new teaching job after just one year so I can return to school full time?. I (26M) was hired this summer to teach science at my local middle school. The administration has spent a lot of time training me, and I hold several sponsorship positions within the school (coaching football, sponsoring a couple club, etc). Along with my science classes, the school gave me my choice of teaching several elective classes that are desired by much of the staff, so I took two of them. 

Here’s the thing. I decided to leave my old school to take this job because I felt that it would refresh my idea of teaching and spark the love for teaching that I always thought I would have. Sadly, that hasn’t been the case. This job is way better than my previous job, but I just haven’t developed the desire to make this a lifelong career. I want to find a different path that will allow me to work with kids, but not be in the classroom any longer.

The reason I’m feeling conflicted is because this school went out of their way to hire me. They didn’t have to accommodate me the way they did. I do sometimes feel that it would be unfair of me to put them in the position of needing to hire again so soon, especially with good science teachers being in short supply in my area. 

My family also believes I’m in the wrong for planning to leave so soon. They say I’m putting the school in a terrible position, especially after the effort they put in to hiring me. They argue that I would have left two schools out in the cold over the course of two years. 

Regardless of all the school did for me to get me here, and my family’s feelings, I plan to leave at the end of this year. AITA?

Edit: I wasn’t clear enough. I didn’t leave my first position after only one year. I was there for several years before making this change.

I said nothing.

If the phone ringing is bothering you you turn the ringer down/off from your end.

"AITA for not supporting my husband in an overhead disagreement?. We were on a relatively small, full flight and my husband had put his small backpack in the overhead compartment. A woman (who I thought was a flight attendant) came over and started making comments on the backpack, saying it shouldn’t be in the overhead when there are larger bags that needed space. She then proceeded to ask who owned the bag and my husband responded. I could see that another passenger had a large bag that needed the space and my husband was raising his voice so I defused the situation by agreeing to put the bag under our front seat. After she left, my husband muttered “bitch” about her under his breath and I said “hey!” (shocked that he would say that about a flight attendant) and then “she’s kind of right, you shouldn’t be putting your backpack in the overhead” and he got angry at me for not supporting him. 

Having flown a lot for work, I do get annoyed about folks taking up space in the overhead with backpacks and briefcases as I usually bring a carry on roller bag that can’t be stored under the seat, when theirs usually can. 

We have gotten into arguments like this in the past where he feels that I should always support him in public, and I feel like I can’t always support him if I think he is wrong. Usually, this happens when he feels wronged or defied in public but I think he’s actually TA.

"AITA For getting angry at a snapping at a good friend of mine. **Some info before hand.**   
My friend group enjoys insulting each other for fun, most are actual insults which would normally piss people off, but to us it doesn't really bother any of us. We treat them as over the internet ""play punches"". We have one friend who is one of my Closer friends in the group, who has gone through a tough life, and is the kinda the center of this story. Lets call him **T**  


**The incident**  
It was a normal discord call between us all, with everything going normally. We were joking around and the conversation drifted to school, and things about it. **T** Dropped out of high school at a young age and because of that, and the fact he lives in Florida, he ended up being mentioned in the conversation. I didn't talk or pay attention during this time (i was playing *Warframe* and blasting music) but What transpired is one playful insult dug way to deep at that moment. I cant quote it but the insult really hurt my friend. Afterword we completely stopped with the insults about real life, with us realizing our insults about the real life dug way to deep in a good amount of the Group.  


**Aftermath (And where the issue happened)**  
We mostly stopped with the insults, at times we will still throw some joking ones but not at the same level as before, i think all of us feel extremely guilty about the entire situation. But there is still a good friend to us all who will still throw the normal insults. I guess i was feeling pissed off or rubbed the wrong way but this one joke set me off. All of us recently saw a meme about sending people a box of Gummy D\*\*ks (gummy bears style but shaped like D\*\*ks). He thought it would be Glorious to send one of those to my work. with my name on it. I lost it, ""what if that causes me to get fired"" and all the lot, it was honestly when i look back at it a real massive overreaction. I straight up told him ""no one does those joke any more why do you think its F\*\*king ok to do those jokes still!"" and honestly ripped into him. he ended up leaving the server in the end stating ""i cant be here if im only hurting peoples feelings"".

"AITA for changing my mind about my gf's kids?. I've been dating this girl since late August. We actually have a history together where we were coworkers and we started secretly seeing each other. Well where we were working shut down and we were both laid off. She ended up moving 2 states away and I always felt like she was the one that got away. Anyway about 6 years later now and she's back in town I guess she got serious with another guy where she was living and they ended up having twins.

So she contacted me when she came back into town and she said she's single and I'm single so we started dating again. Early on she asked me if I was ok with her twins and I'd be ok with dating someone with kids. I said yeah I was cool with it, why not right? I've always wanted kids and these kids were already around 3 years old. 

I haven't met her kids this whole time because she said something about not wanting to confuse them and I was cool with it. Things have been getting pretty serious between us and things are going good so last week she told me she's ready for me to meet her kids now. I was excited I really like this girl and am ready to take it to the next level. 

So I met her kids and they were cool and weren't scared of me or anything and were running up to me wanting to play and stuff, but I just wasn't feeling it. I don't know how to explain this feeling, but I just wanted to get away from these kids. She was always showing me pics of them and stuff, but meeting them in person they look exactly like their father and that made me so uncomfortable for some reason.

I wasn't sure about the kids anymore, but I really really like her and I know it's a package deal with the kids and her.

"AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for not having me come up and see her this weekend?. My girlfriend is in college and I've recently graduated. We don't get to see each other too often but make time on the weekends.  At school she lives in a conjoined single which means there are two separate rooms and a shared bathroom. I have only stayed one weekend there since school started. Her roommate who lives in the other room told her I ""probably shouldn't come this weekend"" because her boyfriend is coming up and there might be too many people sharing the bathroom. I personally think that is ridiculous because 4 people sharing one bathroom is not a big deal considering I'll be taking one shower and maybe have to go to the bathroom once or twice. My girlfriend graduates in the winter and did not have any friends going into this year since she transferred but because of her roommate, she made friends with her and her friends. She doesn't want to make her mad and jeopardize her friendship but my counter argument is it isn't worth being friends with someone who would say that in the first place.

"AITA? Our son shares a name with my ex and my husband didn't know.. My husband and I had our first son this year! Named him William. To choose his name we each wrote a list of our top 10 and then checked to see if any matched. William is a family name on both sides and sounds really good with our last name. It was the only shared name between our lists, so Will it is.

Of note: I have an ex named Will. We dated for a short time, slept together for a long time. I did NOT name my son after Will - I have always liked that name, it has family value, etc.

Fast forward to last weekend. An old friend of mine visited and one night she drunkenly started telling stories. She got into a tale about the time Will and I were banging on the porch couch and somehow fell into the inner workings and got lodged there with him inside me and we had to yell for help to be pulled out of the couch, bare asses and all. Great story, but obviously not an ideal choice with my husband as the audience. He got quiet, and shortly after we put my friend to bed. I thought the story rubbed him the wrong way but the first thing he said to me was, ""Will?"" I hadn't even registered that she used his name, but she did and my husband was pretty disturbed that our son shared a name with a man I'd slept with and that I never thought to mention it. We don't talk much at all about our exes so it wasn't strange to me that Will's name never came up, but to my husband he feels like I intentionally hid it.

You and your friend that is. Why on earth would she tell your husband about the time you were getting porked by an ex? What kind of friend does that?

"WIBTA for not letting my kids go on a cruise?. First let me set the stage for this drama. I (30F) and my Ex-husband (30M) have two children from our previous marriage, a daughter who is 11 and a son who is 8. His girlfriend has 3 children from a prior relationship.

This Christmas, he announced to them that he and his girlfriend were taking them on a cruise (Cozumel) for spring break. From what I have been told he has already bought the tickets and gave them to the kids as presents. My initial response that really hasn't wavered much was ""hell no"". But my family has been trying to make arguments that I should let this happen.

A list of reasons I think this is a bad idea:

1. My ex and his girlfriend fight...a lot. This has caused issues with pretty much every vacation or trip they have taken the kids on in the past. Usually when they fight, the girlfriend takes off sometimes even leaving her kids with him and she goes to the club or spends the night somewhere else. 
2. Our kids have never been on a cruise, and our son gets car sick quite easily. So I have a fear that he will pretty much be sick the entire time he is on the boat. 
3. While I love our son to the ends of the earth, he is clueless when it comes to any sort of danger or crowds. He can be a little air-headed at times and if he were to get lost he might even forget his name. 
4. Our daughter also has very little idea of what dangers could possibly arise on this trip and it worries me that she is a easy target for someone with ill-intent.

Yesterday my ex called and said he needed the kids birth certificates for their passports. I told him that I wasn't sure I wanted the kids to go on a cruise and that pissed him off of course. Most of the phone call was me explaining my fears with him responding that he wouldn't let anything happen to them. Of course I know he doesn't want any harm to come to them, but one fight with his girlfriend and he's gonna be left on a cruise ship with 5 kids. Both of our kids can swim but our son isn't very good at it. When I told my family what had been said, my mom comes back with ""the best you can do is just pray that nothing bad happens"" and my sisters advice is ""well have him take you on the cruise also"" and ""it will be a great experience for the kids"" and saying that my husband and I should just go on the same cruise which we cannot afford. 

I want our kids to have experiences like this in their life, and if my ex and his girlfriend were just taking our daughter since she is older, I might have less reservations than I do now. But given the past experiences that they have had on trips, I think this is a recipe for disaster. So Reddit, would I be the asshole to not let our kids go? Let me know if you want any more info and I will try to respond asap.

*Edit* 

I wanted to reply to all of the posts, but I think I can explain some things better here.

1. I am not jealous of him having the money to take them, and I am glad that they have the opportunity to experience the good parts of these vacations.

2. There are some things that have happened in the past that cause me concern for how well our kids will be looked after on this cruise. Twice in the past 2 years our son has come back from the lake talking about how he got sick from the boat, and twice he has come back with sunburns so bad that I had to take him to the dr for them. I know he’s light skinned and can burn easily, but neither time was any sunblock applied and he had blisters from head to toe. 

3. I think he is capable of taking care of all 5 kids should she take off, but that was in a hotel at the lake, not on a cruise ship or in a foreign country.

4. I admit I should have worded the part about his name better. It’s not that he would actually forget, but when he is in any kind of stressful situation he shuts down and stops talking. He does have some issues that we are trying to figure out (possibly dyslexic/ADD). And I know they aren’t babies, but they don’t really have a grasp of the possible dangers. I talk to them about these things but thankfully they haven’t had any personal experience yet.",YTA. The kids probably won't even spend much time with you ex or his girlfriend as they will probably be part of a bunch of different activities which are arranged on board. So the worries of him being alone with 5 kids has no real merrit. Also kids are 8 and 11 not 3 and 5. Not babies anymore. And seriously - your son wont even remember his name! If that was really the case a cruise shouldn't be your biggest worry.,1,1,0,0,0
"AITA for being mad at my son for getting me a gift. My son joined college this year. I've been in a tight spot financially after paid my son's tuition fee. Despite this, I manage to pay $100 per month for my son's personal expenses (I've already paid for his accommodation and food).

"AITA if my good friend (M) repeatedly cheated on another friend of mine (F) and I haven't cut him out of my life?. I (F, late 20s) have been friends with this guy, let's call him Dick, for 13 years, he's one of my best friends and we regularly hang out as we're both in the same circle of friends. He isn't a bad guy but he clearly has issues when it comes to honesty, especially in romantic relationships. 

Dick is a pathological liar and will always have 2-3 girlfriends at the same time (without them knowing) and cheat on them whenever he can. He's done this for the last 10 years and all of us friends have always known (he tells us all about the horrible things he does), but other than calling him out on it there wasn't much we could do.

We always tried not to get involved by avoiding unnecessary contact with the poor girls. We would see them very occasionally and pretend everything was good. I always tried to avoid those situations because I felt guilty knowing all I knew and seeing them happy with their seemingly perfect boyfriend. I often questioned my morality because if I were in their shoes I would really want someone to tell me the truth. In all these years, very few of them found out what was going on, while the others just got dumped for random made-up reasons.

However, three years ago Dick decided he wanted to hit on a good friend of mine, Jane, who he'd just met a few weeks before. Weirdly, he was fully single at the time, but still I was horrified because I could already picture what would happen. I begged him to change his mind and I warned her and told her all about his past. Told her she would end up cheated on, just like the others before her. But she liked him, and replied ""I believe people can change"". I knew he wouldn't, but there was nothing I could do at that point. They started dating and I promised Jane that if he ever cheated on her I would tell her immediately, and I let him know too. 

One year went by, and obviously Dick started cheating on Jane with another girl. I forced him to confess to Jane, threatening to tell her myself if he didn't. He confessed, she forgave him. After one month he went back to the other girl. Jane found out, forgave him again. This happened one more time until she FINALLY broke up with him. The whole ordeal lasted approximately one year.

I stayed friends with both. After a few weeks Jane told me something along the lines of ""If you really care about me, I can't understand why you didn't cut him out of your life after what he's done to me"". She didn't bring that up again, now it's been a few months and she seems ok with me and Dick being friends.

I know he's a toxic person but he has been one of my best friends for more than a decade, we've always been there for each other and even if he's a dickhead with his girlfriends he's a good friend to us. I also believe that being abandoned by his only true friends would make him an even worse person.

At the same time I'm afraid I might have been a bad friend to Jane. So what do you think? AITA?

God decided that my life was just a little too easy and decided to take me down a peg and so this happened to coincide with a week after my leg was amputated below the knee.

So not off to a great start with the kid obviously. Our apartment isn’t exactly crutches friendly. There seems to be a narrow doorway every 4 feet and the furniture is not exactly ideally arranged. 

I’m back at work now, I work a desk job so it hasn’t been impacted too much by my surgery. I’m working with my physical therapist to use a prosthetic but that hasn’t been going great. Still can’t walk with it.

My wife is going to be a stay at home mom until kindergarten starts. She has stopped breast feeding and wants me to start doing half the nights. My issue is that it takes me much longer to navigate the house and I can’t carry him. I can hold him sitting but not standing. So it requires a maneuver where I move one of the high chairs next to the sofa, take him out of the crib and put him on the sofa, transfer myself from the chair to the sofa, then pick him back up. Then I can use the ottoman and a towel to change him. Or feed him or whatever.

However AITA for declining foods like meatloaf, casseroles made with things like tinned soup, pierogis, grits,  frito pies, any 'salad' with mayo etc by saying I don't eat 'ethnic food'. To me these are American(ized like in the case of pierogis).

I don't always say that but if the general topic of food comes in depth with people I've gotten to know up I mention I don't really eat ethnic food like the above. This applies to most other European/Asian extracts too.

I've gotten some people act quite offended and say it's not 'ethnic'.

"AITA for removing all of the pictures in our house?. Of course, there is more too it than that.

&#x200B;

I am an amateur photographer and take and mount lots of photos that I we use in the home as art pieces. Most are landscapes, some are family photos.  I got my wife a number of pictures framed for Christmas. In addition, we had probably 7-10 other framed prints sitting in my room that needed hanging.  My wife had been bugging me for weeks to get them hung up.

&#x200B;

About a month ago, she took the kids to see her parents. I spent my ""free time"" doing projects around the house--including hanging all the pictures. Note that I actually take a lot of care and consideration into what gets mounted where. I am also anal retentive and make sure I have exact spacing between photos and use a level. Took me about 3 hours.

&#x200B;

My wife comes home and instead of being happy that I did what she asks, she goes on a rampage about how I ""dictated"" were the photos would be and ""didn't ask for her input.""  I responded by apologizing and saying I thought it was more important that they were hung in a timely manner because she had been riding me about it.  I then asked her which photos she didn't like where and she said ""thats not the point; it should have been a joint decision.""   

&#x200B;

This resulted in a major argument in which she asserted that I have ""taken control of decorating"" and ""she never gets to put anything where she wants"" (note, I have never refused a request by her to decorate something).  

&#x200B;

I got angry enough that after she went to bed, I took down every single photo in the house, removed all the nails, and placed all the frames, nails, a hammer, tapemeasure, and level, and left them next to her side of the bed.

&#x200B;

She was not a happy camper in the morning and called me an asshole.   That was 4 weeks ago.  Yesterday I told her she could hang them wherever she wanted, and she said ""I don't know how to.""

"AITA If I Yelled At A Friend for Using Autistic/Retarded as an Insult. So this just happened, and I'm kind of fuming about it, but I don't know if I was in the right here.

I'm still in school, and I belong to a swim team.  I've known some of these other kids my whole life, and not even recently but for years they've called each other retarded and autistic.  From my having legitimately autistic classmates who I have always considered friends, this has always bothered me.

&#x200B;

One of my general friends there was watching two kids whip each other with towels and generally doing stupid things to annoy each other.  He commented, ""Oh, that's so retarded.  You're so autistic.""

&#x200B;

I snapped on him and got in his face, yelling that autism isn't a thing to joke about and that it's an insult to people who actually have it and can't control it to use it as an insult, the same thing as making fun of someone with a general infectious disease.  I said whenever he did that it was awful, and that he shouldn't make fun of people who are disabled because they can't control it.  However, this was screamed in his face with a bit of profanity.

"WIBTA if I stand up against my aunt for being psychologically abusive to my cousins?. My aunt from Canada brought her kids (my cousin) to come to visit my family in Thailand for a few weeks and has be very problematic so far. My cousins are only 9 and 12, and I’m 17.

She may or may not be abusive but from my family’s point of view, she’s being abusive.

Red flag 1:The first huge red flag began when she started to threaten and insulted me for having a smartphone. While I was in the elevator with my dad and her I showed my dad a song I wrote. But as soon as I brought my phone out she said “Aren’t you too young to have a phone? Do you realise how detrimental that is?” In a very threatening tone. I gave her reasonable points of why I need a phone but she kept get mad at me until my dad had to say that he was the one who wanted me to have the phone.

Red flag 2:Moreover, she mentioned that her daughters are a musical prodigy; they write classical music everyday, and so on. I believed it at first but when I talked to them about writing music they said they actually never did. They were forced to write music. They are forced to practice 5 hours a day on the violin.

Red flag 3: she bragged about her “parenting skills” by mentioning that her daughters are only allowed 2 ice creams per year, and no television or any form of entertainment is allowed. She said that this would be the only way to keep the kids in order. 

During dinners they would secretly hint at my dad to order ice cream and desserts for them without letting their mom know. But she found out and she screamed right in their faces and then after her screaming, tried to teach all of us why it’s bad for children to have ice cream and how bad my dad’s parenting is (my dad is a certified marriage and parenting counselor).

Red Flag 4: On our trekking trips my cousins were walking quite slow because they were carried away in their conversation. Usually a parent would tell them to hurry but what my aunt did was scolded them for just walking slightly slow... they weren’t that far behind! I was standing right by them and we were only 4 meters behind. The fact that they stopped their conversation immediately and dashed to stand right by her was quite... unsettling? I never saw a kid behave like that EVER.

Red flag 5: My dad brought my aunt and her children to his hotel for a tour but when they walked passed my dad’s business partners, she demanded they her kids must hug my dad’s business partners. They seemed extremely uncomfortable doing that with someone they don’t know but they did it anyways. The look on their faces just didn’t seem right.

There’s more red flags but 5 of the red flags are already a lot.

So WIBTA to at least stand up for my cousin’s when their mom is being unreasonable...? 

TL;DR: My aunt is trying to rear my cousins to be a perfect human being but seems that my cousins are absolutely tired of it.

"AITA for giving away my birthday present?. So, my best friend (female) tried to gift me (rather heavy male) a onesie for my birthday. As you could expect, it wouldn‘t fit, partly because she ordered one for people with a height max of 185cm, as she figured me being 186cm would still fit. I wasn‘t really disappointed, as i don‘t make much out of birthday presents (i didn‘t really ever get ‚huge‘ presents (sometimes none) as my family is a royal clusterfuck) anyway, but she felt terrible. 
So, she tried to remember anything i said or looked at in order to find something different to gift me, and settled on a Nintendo Switch Dock Cover, with an illuminated picture of a pikachu, which i looked at more than once at GameStop. 

Problem is, i have a special edition (Smash Bros.) version of the nintendo switch, so the dock cover would be pretty much useless for
me. I was looking for it bc i wanted to gift it to my brother, who has the generic switch dock and is overall more sympathetic to collecting plastic „garbage“. 

So, i gave the dock cover to my brother and bought myself a controller charging station, and told my friend that my brother swapped it with me. She seemed disappointed, and didn‘t really understand until i told her to look at my dock. 

With my birthday coming up again fairly soon, the topic has begun to come up again, but she did tell me not to say anything as to what to get me, as she wants it to be a ‚surprise‘ (which i really don‘t get, i‘m more happy to be gifted something at all, so even knowing what i‘ll get would not affect it), and ‚not be an ass again and give it away‘ like last year.

"WIBTA for attempting to reach out to someone who has unfriended and blocked me on Steam?. A bit long, but thank you for reading and responding. 

So 1-2 years ago I was very active in a particular game on Steam. I had originally bought it solely to play with friends, but found both the grind and learning curve exiting and decided to play it on my own. For those who don't know Steam is a gaming platform/hub that allows PC users to connect with one another across borders and games. 

Somewhere along the line I encountered a player that was both skilled and fun to play with. Over many months our relationship to the point where we would play together semi-daily. We had our own private jokes and gags, and I ultimately considered us to be good friends.

He eventually grew somewhat tired of the game. We would only play together occasionally, seeing as to how we both had our separate gangs and other games to enjoy. However, I still considered us friends. He had even joined in and met some of my friends in our sessions.

A thing that's worth mentioning is that we never voice chatted. However, he claimed that he was the same age and gender as me.

At some point I realized that I hadn't heard from him in quite a while. He'd told me he'd been dealing with depression and naturally I was a little worried. 

Checking my friend list I realized that I couldn't find him. I checked my friends' lists and realized he'd unfriended them too. 

I was able to found his profile through a comment he'd posted on mine. Turned out he'd blocked me when I tried to send him a new friend request. 

I commented on the screenshot he'd commented on hoping that hed be notified but quickly deleted it. I thought he probably just wanted to be left alone and respected his decision, even though part of me was sad he didn't seem to want to stay in contact with me. 

It's been a year now when I suddenly remembered the whole ordeal. I sneaked a look at his profile, and he's still active. Part of me wants to create an alt-account and message him what's up. 

Part of me believes he's not who he pretended to be, as I'd offered to voice chat with him a couple times, but he never said yes. I guess it could also somehow be tied into him dealing with his issues; but I've never been depressed and don't know as much as I'd like to about what it does to you emotionally. Question remains, what do you think the reason could be? And do you think I would be wrong to try to message him?

"AITA for leading my friend into a one sided relationship?. This happened a few years ago, but I’m still torn about it. 

I had this friend, who I’ll call Peter. Peter was transgender (FTM), and his family was transphobic, so he couldn’t come out to them. 

This, along with other factors such as severe social anxiety and dysphoria, lead to him becoming more depressed. He would often talk to me about his problems, which was fine, I would try to help as best as I could. Previously, when I had tried to tell his parents, he would get very upset with me, and his parents wouldn’t do much to help the situation, which is why I hadn’t tried that in a while. His depression continued to become more severe as time went on, with him telling me about how he had almost taken his life a year prior and how he was self harming. He also had a girlfriend at the time, who I’ll call Gwen.

One day, we were FaceTiming and he just said “Oh I have a crush on somebody!” I was confused, because I knew he had a girlfriend. I asked about that, and he just said, “I’m polyamorous.” Eventually, with me asking enough questions, I got him to tell me who he liked. It turned out, he liked me. I didn’t feel the same way for him, but I was nervous that if I said no, he would handle the rejection poorly, and hurt himself or do something worse. So, I said, “oh yeah I like you too!” 

For roughly 2 months, I pretended to feel the same way for him. I would always say stuff like, “yknow it takes humans about 6 months to fall in love, maybe wait and see if what you’re feeling is right?” I was trying to delay more stuff from happening.

"AITA for not letting my employees switch shifts?. Here's the story of my current situation. I work at a coffee shop and our manager recently left. While we are manager-less I have been put in charge. I do all daily operations, orders, maintenance, settling employee issues, etc etc. I do all of this without any additional pay or title change (they're ""working on"" promoting me but that's a post for a different sub on a different day).  The only things I don't have access to are payroll and schedule building so they're being taken care of by a manager from a near by location. Everybody knows those two things are out of my control and if they need to change their availability or ask for days off they need to talk to that manager, not me. She requires these requests to be put in 2 weeks in advance.

Everybody knows the shitty situation I'm in right now. I'm running a store with no control over my staff's schedules. After schedules get published people often come to me with issues (""I was scheduled on a day and time I have school"" and ""this was already approved time off and yet somehow I'm working???"") They have to put in requests 2 weeks in advance. Everything is just one huge cluster fuck. In instances like this I decide to fuck it and not deal with my ""babysitter."" I find some way to rearrange the shifts and everything works out fine. I've talked to them so many times about how they need to be patient and understanding. I said that I know things suck right now but it's temporary and we'll all get through together. Things will go back to normal after the holidays. In the meantime I'm doing what I can to keep things as normal as possible. You'd think everyone would understand how difficult this all is and they'd be a little mature. I'd hope they could make small sacrifices like just dealing with the fact that their shifts are going to look a little different than we're used to (ex 9AM - 5PM instead of 8AM - 4PM).

There's one barista in our shop that is more bitter than the coffee we serve. She gets off on being pissed off. Anyways... right before my boss left, this barista demanded she be cut to working 4 days a week. Not for school or another job. No. She wants to work 4 days a week because ""it's not fair that I work 5 days a week and bring home 22 hours while Eric works 4 days a week and has the same number of hours!""

She also insists on being out by 3pm every day. ""I need time to see my girlfriend! Never get to see her because our work schedules clash and then I keep getting scheduled all weekend when she's off!"" There are only 3 shifts that get out by 3pm and they're all shorter shifts. The only two 8 hour shifts at our store are 8-4 and a closing shift that gets out around 11:30 at night.  She refuses to work these shifts, again, so she can ""spend time with her girlfriend.""

So next week's schedule came out yesterday and this salty barista saw that she's working 4 days but only has 18 hours. She started complaining left and right. I tried to ignore it because I didn't have time to deal with her hissy baby fit. It's month end, I have a mountain of work, corporate is on my ass despite not giving me access/resources to do my job, and she literally brought this on herself. Besides, I don't build the schedule. She knows this. I can fix small issues but this is not something I had any say in.

At the end of her shift she comes to me telling me she's taking another baristas shift (for a total of 5 days and 23 hours). He works 2 jobs so he doesn't ""need as many shifts here"" and is willing to give her one to help boost her hours. Well denied the request. If he really wants the day off, somebody else can take the shift. But he doesn't want to because she approached him about giving it to her. I am sick of her not being a team player, being negative, and wanting her way or the highway. She cut down her availability drastically and still expects to rake in 22-25 hours a week. Even if I had control over the schedules, I can't pull hours out of my ass like that. 

I told her that I won't allow it because of the availability she insisted on. If she wants more hours she can return to having open availability and pick up some mid day or closing shifts. But I will not give her more morning shifts when she insists on working this way. We have plenty of other people (positive team players) that also need to work morning shifts. 

If I keep accommodating her she'll keep walking all over me and taking advantage of the situation we're in. And it won't stop when I become the manager either. She'll keep doing shady things to get exactly what she wants. This is my line in the sand as a new leader. Am I the asshole for that?","Oof.

When we argumented she said that when I am allowed to have female friends why isn't she allowed to have some guys as friends. I then told her that she knows all of my friends and all of them are in a relationship, I on the other hand have never met her colleague. 
At the end some facts: 
We are together for 4 years 
We moved in together a half year ago

So I want to know: AITA for wanting her to not have contact with this guy outside of work?","YTA

She seems to be doing everything on the up-and-up in terms of keeping this strictly platonic. She's open with you about their conversations. There's nothing you've described from his end that suggests romantic interest. The only ""causes for concern"" here are the same characteristics you would see of a genuine friendship, and it is not fair for you to try and deny her that.

It's reasonable to continue paying attention, and re-evaluate if *actual* red flags show up, but right now there aren't any and you shouldn't obsess over this.",1,1,0,0,0

"AITA if I play video games over being with my gf?. EDIT — thank you for all of your replies!

I live with my girlfriend and she’s sick (cold/flu type thing), she wants me to get in bed with her and watch a film since she’s feeling crappy and could use a cuddle, BUT it’s only 21:00, I don’t want to go to bed yet, and I fancy playing some games for 30 mins/1 hr. 


So, AITA for going to play video games instead of being with her?


Clarification, I’m not worried about catching anything since she caught the cold from me and I doubt I’d pick it up again. Also, I’ve made it very clear to my girlfriend that I’ve not had much time for myself this year and I want some space. I did play the games yesterday however and have a lot of time for it tomorrow.

WIBTA if I asked my girlfriend to stop complaining about graduate school?. About nine months ago my girlfriend of three years moved away to go to graduate school and we have been together long distance. I stayed put because I have several years left of school to finish. Now it feels like every conversation we have turns into her complaining about how much work she has to do and little time she has to do fun things. By her own admission she is a huge procrastinator which is probably why she gets so stressed. The complaining is annoying me because it feels like if she was going to do something that was going to be so hard on our relationship she could at least try to stay positive about it and take it seriously.

Well R really likes K's girlfriend and sends her a text that said ""I think you and me should have a secret relationship.""

The girl told K and he is pissed, since they are both in football, they have a weight-lifting class, and they were in the locker room when K confronts him about it.

I guess they argued a little then K said this: ""*Listen here, I will put you 6 feet under the ground so you can burn in hell with your mother.*""

K pushed R to the ground and then the coach came in and picked up R then K punched him right in the face, giving him a black eye.

"AITA for asking out the crush of my former bully who shamed me into anorexia, right in front of said bully?. I've lived in the same town since I was born and am 24 now. I'm 5'5, 120 pounds, and have a toned body as a swimmer. This is ideal for me.

My family is close and we have frequent family gatherings, three to six times a month typically. Usually the gatherings separate into people of the same group and gender forming cliques and hanging out together. My clique is young adult women which includes my sister and my two female cousins. My sister and one of the cousins are married now.

The other cousin however, back in high school tormented me about my weight relentlessly, causing me to actually fall into anorexia. That was hell, I ended actually going to the hospital for malnutrition. When my parents found out they raised hell with my aunt and uncle in law and that cousin was punished with a one month grounding. I never felt like that was enough and she continued to bully me in secret, but after my stint in the hospital I became a lot more mentally strong.

And kind of vindictive too. I hated that bitch for almost killing me.

I don't feel like she ever lost her nasty personality, but she did gain something like 100 pounds in college and she was already plump in high school. So now she's mordibly obese and this has a lot to do with why she's unmarried and single. She DOES have a massive crush on one of my friends though. They share some hobbies like knitting and watching cooking dramas, and she's always asking him to hang out and he's just oblivious so he always does with no inkling of her ulterior motives.

Now he's a great friend of mine and to be honest I like him too, not as much as her though, but I could see myself marrying him in the future if we dated for say 4 years. So I tried my luck with him and could tell that he definitely found me attractive. Ended up asking him out to some ""dates"" (never defined really). He's also definitely a monogamous guy, so I was fairly sure if I asked him to go steady with me he'd say yes.

So what I did was bring him as a +1 to one of our family gatherings and asked him to go steady with me right. in. front. of. that. cousin. (he said yes) He's a swimmer so he's got a nice body and I made some comments about his body that basically amounted to me admiring his athleticism and him reciprocating mine in front of that cousin. Made her cry and leave the gathering. She hasn't showed up to the last two. Me and the new boyfriend are doing great and I am really falling for him hard, so it's not like I used him or anything.

My sister pulled me aside and said that I shouldn't have flaunted in front of cousin and that she was going through depression and my friend who she had a crush on was one of her lights. I responded by reminding her of how scared our family was when I went to the hospital and that she was just starting to get her just desserts. Sister went silent, but I can tell she didn't totally agree. Definitely don't want this getting back to my boyfriend, so that made me think I was maybe an asshole.",ESH except the guy.

She’d just gotten out of a bad housing situation with a drug addict roommate who threw her stuff away, broke into her room, yelled at her, etc. She seemed like a clearly damaged person, maybe a little autistic but nice.

Turns out she’s a barely functioning person. She cannot pick up on a social cue if you broadcast it in neon lights (and unprompted has mentioned she doesn’t have autism).

I (24f) have been on birth control for a year now. As expected, I’m easily irritated and moodier than I used to be. I really only started taking them because my boyfriend (21) wanted me to. Because he never liked wearing condoms.

"AITA for arguing with a senior citizen. Here is my situation. We have an AMC theater that my son (22) and I (51) go to. For those not familiar with AMC they have a rewards program that if you pay for the premium (which I do) enables you to enter express lines for buying tickets and refreshments. Well, one day the two of us go to the theater and they only have one box office open. There is a sign that says for premium members to enter on the left and for everyone else to enter on the right. We of course, enter on the left and are third in line. The right line has approximately ten patrons in it.

The first person in our line goes first. Then the first person in the other line. Then the cashier beckons the person in front of me to come up and be next. When this happens there is an older gentlemen probably around 65 (who is in the longer line ) who starts screaming. He starts waving his card around and wants to know why he isn’t being treated the same as the people in my line. The Cashier asks him if he is a premium member and he replies yes. Now, I’m not sure if you can actually tell from the card if you are or not as the card still has perks if you aren’t a premium member. The Cashier tells him that he is in the wrong line and waves him over to my line.

The gentleman then steps in front of me and is now next in line for the cashier. Then this happens

Son- “Hey, get in the back in the line!!”

Senior Citizen- What!!!!!

Son- “I said, get in the back in the line”

SC- “I’ve been here longer than you have”

Son- “Not my fault, you can’t read a sign or follow simple instructions”

SC- “You want a piece of me, punk” (That may not be the exact quote, but it is close)

I’m actually not sure what my son said at the point as now I was between the two of them with a hand in my son’s chest pushing him backwards and telling the SC that he can go next.

Son- “Dad, are you seriously going to let this asshole in front of you”

SC- Some curse words

Son- Some more curse words

Me- “Yes, and calm the F down before the cops get called”

"AITA for wanting the door open. Second time poster, long time lurker, and I’m on mobile so sorry for spelling errors and bad formatting

I’ve had a long day and a long night so far, particularly the night was pretty draining. 3hrs at a youth organisation (which shall not be named for reasons), this 3 hrs included a fire drill, regular drill (marching n shit) for an hour, and self defence for an hour and a half. The self defence is the main reason for my tiredness, I’m not particularly strong nor do I have good stamina, so it was incredibly draining, also I was getting hit. 

I ask my sister to pick me up afterwards and drive me home, its not even a 5 minute drive, I’d walk but its 9 o’clock and half the street lights don’t work so driving is the safer option. She picks me up, and instead of turning right, to go home, she turns left. We drive around for half an hour listening to her music, with the heat turned up to maximum. I ask her to go straight home and she says “nah, we’re going the long way”

We eventually get home, 30mins later. I open the garage, she drives in, yadda yadda. Then we get to the door, I can’t get my keys out because I’m holding things, so I step back from the door. She steps forward and starts to unlock it and turns to me and says “jeez, do I have to do everything around here” in a sarcastic and snarky way. She notices I have a blank face (apparently resting bitch face) and she stops unlocking the door and says 
“what’s your problem?” 
“unlock the door”   
“You look annoyed, and there’s no need to be rude, why’re you so rude?”
At this point, I’m fed up. I want to get inside, eat my dinner and go to bed, she’s already wasted half an hour of my time. So I say to her “OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR” I’ll admit I shouldn’t have yelled, or raised my voice, but I was already pissed off. 

As we walk through the door, she screams back at me, saying “WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM? WHY’RE YOU SUCH AN ASSHOLE?”
I walk past not saying anything in fear of getting wayy too angry and doing something I shouldn’t. She then screams at the top of her lungs “YOURE SO FUCKING USELESS AND YOURE AN ABSOLUTE DICK ALL THE TIME, YOURE JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER” and she storms off slamming doors.

She proceeds to then say how hurt she was that I wouldn’t consider her feelings about telling her that I was interested in someone else. I was slightly confused. I was not aware she still had any sort of feelings for me until this conversation. I was just trying to vent to her and I feel like she made it about herself. She had said that because she mentioned having a recent dream about flirting with me should have been enough of a clue that she still had feelings for me. To me, that’s not definitive enough.","ESH.

"AITA For responding to misandry with misogyny?.  

I was at a family gathering this Friday. My mom and aunt were talking about women and feminism, when I heard my aunt say something along the lines of ""..yeah women are just generally smarter than men.."" to which I responded ""I've never heard a man talk about astrology""- this was followed by 10 minutes of berating by both my mom and aunt, telling me this type of talk is unacceptable and I need to learn to understand women. The atmosphere was lighthearted before I made my comment, and honestly I made it as a joke, didn't expect both of them to turn on me that fast.

Is it really ok for women to trash talk men, and not ok for men to respond back?

Please keep in mind the culture in my country is a bit different, and here all the ""supernatural"" stuff (tarot cards, fortune tellers, coffee readers etc) is done mostly by women- all of which seems kinda silly to me, but to each his own

"AITA for ignoring my dad the entire morning for poking fun at me last night?. My dad and I were on the way home from work and school last night. I was telling him about my friend who was having a bad day, then he suddenly says ""I hope you didn't tell her that cheesy, text-book inspirational crap you told me before."" He was referring to my first day of college, when I was feeling really nervous and scared but I was trying to motivate myself. I was taken aback because I was really emotional and anxious during that time and he was making fun of it. I still feel the same way I felt during that time. He knows I tend to talk a lot when I'm nervous. Anyways, I didn't tell him I was offended and we just had some playful banter about it on the way home. 

Fast forward to when my family and I are about to sleep. It's important to note that the issue was brought up again during dinner, but I just joined in on the banter so as not to spoil the fun my family was having, poking jokes at me. Anyways, my dad proceeds to mockingly apologize to me, teasing me yet again, then hugs me shirtless (don't worry, it's not malicious), holding me in a headlock and teasing me to smell his armpits. Basically how a dad would treat his son, except I'm a 19 year old girl. He already knows I hate it when he does this, and suddenly I just couldn't pretend that I wasn't offended anymore. On top of all that, I was disgusted. I ignore him for the rest of the night and refuse to talk to him until this morning. 

Now he's upset. He wouldn't talk to me the entire car ride here to my campus, and when I was saying goodbye when we was dropping me off, he didn't even look at me or acknowledge me. When I get down from the car, he speeds off. Worst thing is, my mom is siding with him, saying that I'm being too sensitive about it.

"AITA For throwing period blood covered jeans at my sister?. Right i know how bad this sounds but try and understand my reasoning.

Basically it started when my nana planned a day to go swimming with me and have a day just to ourselves. Some really bad stuff has been happening lately and I've been feeling really down so my nana suggested a day to ourselves to make me feel better. 
Usually my nana and I watch my sisters on a Wednesday so we asked my Papa to watch them for a few hours and he said that's fine but not for my sister L, (L has always been a bit of a brat since she started hanging with the horrible wee girls who made fun of my youngest sisters autism) 
L threw a fit she said if she can't come she is going to her friends and tried to leave the house my poor nana had to lock the door, she came in and threw water all over my room and then threw slime at me and it went everywhere and I had to do all the cleaning. (Also she knows I hate slime and can't touch it cause it's freaks me out what is one of the perks of me having Aspergers)

Today she pushed me over the edge when I realized I got my period and it hit hard, blood was running right into my jeans so I rushed to the toilet but L pushed past me so I tried stopping her and said ""L stop I'm on my period and I'm bleeding through"" she looked at me laughed, Locked the bathroom door then said ""but I'm already in"" she proceeded to take as long as she could in the toilet, probably about 10 minutes. By the time she was out blood was all over my white jeans and I was fuming.
So I got a pad went and changed my underwear, changed my jeans for leggings. 
My bloody jeans where Inside out so the blood was alot more visible I took them, went into L's room then did a perfect throw from the door to smack in her face. She looked shocked for a second, looked at me then looked at what hit her then screamed, like those movie scenes screams where wine glasses explode she also started crying and mom came in thinking she fell or something and then shouted at me although I couldn't stop laughing.

"AITA for not buying my boyfriend something special on our anniversary?. Yesterday was mine and my boyfriends 1 year anniversary. I invited him over to my apartment, and to celebrate I bought 2 concert tickets to a movie. Now I bought these tickets because they were extremely cheap and I thought he would enjoy going with me.

When he came around on Tuesday morning we had breakfast and afterward we went to my room.

He then pulled out a present for me. It honestly looked really expensive but I didn't ask and just thanked him for it. He then asked me what I got for him.

I took the I tickets out of my pocket and gave it to him. He had a disappointed look on his face, he didn't shout or anything but then he asked If meant so little to him that I couldn't get him something special for this special occasion.

"WIBTA if I didn't reach out and warn an ex her son (possibly mine) could have a genetic blood disorder?. On mobile so possible format issues.

About a decade ago I screwed around with a married woman who was still active with her husband.  She got pregnant but didn't want to find out (and sincerely) didn't care who the father was/is.  I broke contact because she played games and manipulated my emotions.

I had health issues in the past she was aware of, blood clots.  Was tested for a genetic disorder my father was diagnosed with and his father likely had.  Test was negative.

Fast forward several years.  I had a series of micro strokes that caused a pretty big stroke event.  Retested for the blood disorder and I have it.  I debated get in touch with her to give a heads up but absolutely do not want the drama and insanity she tends to carry with her back into my life.

WIBTA if I didn't attempt to contact her and let her know I do have it and if her son is mine he potentially has it too?


Edit:  The disorder in question is not necessarily life threatening in and of itself.  The reason the first test was negative is because there are two tests.  One more in depth and almost never checked that deeply until the person actually has a stroke.  This is only possibly going to affect him later in life (as in 30s/40s or older). 
It is called Factor V leiden.


Edit 2:  To be perfectly clear.  She 100 % already knew about the fact that I have a family history that includes the blood disorder.  I even explained to her precisely what it is because I am aware of carrier genes especially when it comes to mutations (which Factor V is in medical terms).

"AITA for eating my girlfriend's cat's tuna?. I hope this is a weird one or I'm definitely TA.

My girlfriend Tayla is a big pet girl. I've never been around animals before, but right now she only has one cat and she's trying to ease me into the idea of a lot of pets. I guess she's used to at least three cats and one or two dogs at once, so this is very easy to her. And so far it's been okay. We haven't moved in yet and her cat isn't a nightmare, it's just weird. Like, I guess it's a family tradition or something where if the cat catches a rodent it gets a can of tuna for reward. So she keeps tuna in the house just for the cat. It seems weird to me, but I don't really know what's weird and what isn't with animals.

A while ago I was over at her house for the day and I got hungry so I ate a can of tuna. I didn't think anything of it, I just saw the can and decided I wanted a tuna sandwich. Well, this week I've staying over for multiple days and this morning we get up to a dead mouse. Tayla threw it out and went to get the tuna, but there wasn't any left. I told her I must have had the last one and apologized, because that's pretty lame of me. I should have made sure there was another can.

Her response is what ticks me off. Tayla told me it was okay, I just had to go get some more. Right then, at 5:30 AM. I can see asking me to buy more since I had the last one, but right then? That early? For a *cat*? When I argued, she said her cat had performed pest control and if I didn't get tuna right after he did it he wouldn't know that's why he was being rewarded. She was working herself up to get angry, so after a minute I just knuckled under and went to the store. When I got back she immediately set this cat up with a can of tuna.

It happened earlier today and I'm still ticked. AITA for eating some tuna and then not wanting to get more that early in the morning?","ESH - You knew that tuna was for the cat. Your girlfriend had it for a legitimate reason - animals will correlate things with reward, aka, training.

"AITA for not inviting my friend to something despite not inviting anyone at all?. I’m a twin in college, my brother goes to a different college than me and we both came home recently to see each other, our family, and play d&d he also brought along his college friends to play with us and spend the weekend at our house, and they asked me to be the dungeon master for d&d.
     I told a friend of mine who lives in the area, let’s call her Sarah, and that I frequently play online games with, that I was in the area but I was spending the weekend home and that I was going to do d&d with some of my brothers friends. She dislikes d&d and said that no she didn’t want to come over the night we were playing, but we said we would do something the next weekend because that would be the start of thanksgiving break for me.
    It comes time for me to head home, and once I get there my brother texts me that his friends are coming with him that day(a day early) and are going to spend the night, and that he also invited another friend (who was also friends with Sarah) had no issue with this and thought nothing of it, they come over and we chill out in our basement, play some smash and talk, and the extra person my brother invited posts it on my story, I get a text that night from Sarah, who is very upset that I didn’t invite her, and sent that to our mutual friend aswell, I try to tell her that I didn’t invite anyone there and it just kind of happened as it was my brothers thing and she was absolutely free to come if she wanted, but she got even angrier with me and stopped texting, she is my best friend and she now refuses to talk to me, and makes posts on her Snapchat story about how she is never doing anything for people again because whenever she is nice she gets backstabbed (she helped me out about a month ago by giving me a copy of a game that came with something she bought because she didn’t like the game).

"AITA for blowing up at my parents after I gave them my yearly bonus because they ""couldn't afford"" a vacation but then they spent 3k on wood floors?. I'm in my early 30s and my parents are in their 60s. A few years ago they retired and bought a house in an all inclusive 55+ community after some touch and go money issues.

My childhood home was in an upper middle class neighborhood, I was spoiled, but my dad lost his executive job in my teens and my parents kept spending. Things got bad until they received a 1mil inheritance, but they soon spent that too. They planned to retire to a smaller house in the planned community, but they had trouble selling and almost ran out of money. Finally everything worked out and they were supposed to be on a tight budget. They have been lamenting that they can't afford a vacation.

I had issues with mental illness and severe substance abuse my whole life but I've been clean for a couple years now and finally getting my life together. I have a good job but with my doctor's bills and catching up I live paycheck to paycheck. Last year I was happy to surprise them by giving them part of my yearly bonus just as a gesture.

This year, after I heard they couldn't take a vacation, I again gave them most of my yearly bonus to earmark for a trip (about $800.) I could have really used it, but I felt bad and they've spent so much on me over the years. I wasn't completely financially independent until I got clean.

But now my mom calls my brother to say they're excited that they were approved for an equity loan so that she can replace the carpets with wood floors in their house that's less than 3 years old. It cost 3k. 

I called them, told them they can do what they want, but to stop pretending they're poor when they're obviously not. And that it's my opinion they should stop being so financially irresponsible. 3k to remove carpets is frivolous. I didn't say it but I promised myself I wouldn't give them any more money for vacations.

It's caused this huge fight and some people are saying I was unreasonable. AITA?

------
INFO: They did say they still intend to take the vacation, but it's been months, we're not speaking because of this, and they haven't yet. I told them I was giving them the money for a specific trip that is their favorite. I did that because I thought they might feel obligated to just put it toward their day-to-day expenses or save it or something (lol in retrospect.)

INFO 2 if anyone new is still reading this: I didn't book the trip for them because they're very picky. Like my Mom thinks everything that's not a resort is dirty and my dad has really bizarre requirements for travel and accommodation that I don't understand. It seemed like a better idea to let them book whatever meets their preferences. I mentioned this, pretty much verbatim when I sent them the cash.

Also since I'm updating thanks everyone for the input. It's been awesome to see all the viewpoints, and I think I have more awareness about the whole thing. I was never planning to stop talking to them forever because while I often don't like them I of course love them. I just need a break for a little because my feelings were hurt.","ESH. I wouldn't assume they're ""obviously not poor"" just because they're borrowing money to get a new floor. That's just a bad financial decision, by a couple with a history of bad decisions.

"AITA for pranking my judgemental mother-in law?. Not a Reddit regular, so sorry if I do something wrong. My husband and I are both in our 30’s. My mother in law hates me. She is devoutly Baptist, while I’m not really a religious person. She has told me I dress like a slut, that I will “spend eternity separated from the love of Christ,” and she’s implied that I have drug problems. My hubs and I enjoy cannabis occasionally (legal in our state) but we don’t do any other drugs. 

All of this escalated last month, when she spotted a bong in our living room. It’s a beautiful blown glass piece that our friend made for us, and we like to display it. She immediately went nuts and stormed out of the house.

They’re pretty convincing...google it if you haven’t seen one. I bought it, and when she came over for dinner yesterday, I put it on the counter. I even used baking soda to create fake “residue.”

"AITA for airing an abuser’s “dirty laundry” so their partner could see it? (NSFW). Throwaway for privacy. 

This is an old story from when I was in a friends-with-benefits relationship with a guy who turned out to be an abusive prick, but he’s not the one in the title. I’ll call him A. The title refers to his ex-girlfriend. I’ll call her B. (I’m a guy, btw.)

Backstory: The way I got involved with my ex-FWB was very wrong; he cheated on B with me. Theirs was an open relationship, and I was attracted to A, so I thought, “Why not?” They had limits—his ex was okay with manual stimulation: oral and penetrative sex were off-limits. We went further than that. (B was a childhood friend of mine, which makes it worse IMO.) I fully realize I’m 50% the asshole (50% because it takes two to tango) in that scenario &amp; I cannot even fathom cheating ever again, and I haven’t. 

After I confessed to B that we had cheated (I needed to tell her the truth; I hate lying and felt awful for her), she and A had a constant on-and-off-again relationship. 

Their relationship was toxic even before A cheated; they were very codependent. (I’m talking “B posted an old video of them kissing on her public Instagram the day after they broke up the first time, saying she hated life without him and that she was crying &amp; A replied in a similar manner” codependency.) B was verbally &amp; psychologically abusive, whereas A was mostly psychologically abusive (manipulation and gaslighting—he did the same to me &amp; took advantage of my mental illness to convince me that I was delusional). 

B would text me often. She has a traumatic past &amp; tends to masochistically engage with people who have hurt her, so I tried to minimize contact as much as possible once I realized this. She shared intimate details with me, including that she was in love with this guy she called her “muse” and considering moving in with him. She later had sex with him. This was during a time when she was back together with A. 

I was still into A (hadn’t realized he was toxic yet), so when B dumped him &amp; made him promise to never talk to me again (threatening him with punishment if he contacted me or I contacted him) since “she didn’t want him to move on, especially with me,” I flew off the handle and said she was controlling him &amp; had no right—especially since they were broken up. I went to bed fuming. 

The next day, I shared everything on social media she’d told me not to tell A, since he followed me &amp; if I contacted him directly he’d be punished (plus I was pissed). I didn’t include insults in the post; her actions spoke for themselves. I admitted that I had cheated in the post as well. 

B then blamed me for her heroin relapse (I shit you not), amongst other awful things. She moved away shortly thereafter, &amp; I cut off A a few months later. 

AITA for exposing her publicly? At the time, A called it immature, but everyone who saw the situation firsthand supported my actions.

"AITA for pranking my bf with a tattoo, then leaving?. Sorry for the wall of text, I’m on my lunch break and needed to vent. 
With my BF for almost 2 yrs. Recently, We discussed getting my 1st tattoo as I’d always wanted but never got any while BF has many. Bit of backstory I want to include is that he thinks couples who get matching ones are crazy and he would never let someone get his name tattooed or vice versa. So I thought getting a fake of his name would be a hilarious and harmless joke. Months ago he had fake proposed to me, so I thought this was fine. I liked the way it looked and was excited to show him. Well he didn’t freak out, he loved it and kept asking to see and take pictures. Despite admitting it was “a little much”, his reaction was pretty underwhelming and there was doubt. I decided I had to double down and convince him but he seemed to question it still. We were visiting his family for the holidays so I gave up and decided to tell him after we left. Something you should know about BF: He has habit of ghosting when he gets upset. He gets quiet and withdrawn, when I’m not there he ignores calls or texts back short responses hours later. This is unlike his normally clingy personality and I don’t like or understand it, but everyone has their own way.
It would go on for a day or weekend, every few weeks. Now it happens almost each week and for 2-4 days over the smallest thing. I used to respond terribly as I would overthink and stress myself w assumptions. Id call and text or show up as many times as it took. Now I try to be patient and calm bc I’ve explained to him how worried it makes me when I don’t know why or whats wrong. I remind him that I respect his space but I need him to communicate if he needs it. Or I constantly doubt myself bc he denies being cold or that anything is wrong at all. I understand it isn’t personal, this is just how he is. So when I told him the truth, explained my thoughts and apologized, his reaction was minimal. He said he obviously knew the whole time and got quiet the rest of the drive home. I didn’t get why hed suddenly shut down if the tattoo wasn’t the issue. By now Ik when he does this there’s nothing I can do but wait. Until after 3 days of shunning he admitted he hadn’t known and that he felt stupid for believing I’d “prove my love”. I couldn’t discuss a solution or any conclusion as he’s still on “shut down”. I’m on Day5 and it’d only been 4 days since the last time he ghosted while I was away on a family Xmas trip for a week. This time, I feel I fucked up and he deserves his peace if I’ve hurt him. That doesn’t stop me from noticing I’ve been trying to jump the same hurdle for a year.","ESH.

"AITA For dropping my friend of over 10 years because she wasn’t there for me?. So I don’t even know if I titled it right. 1st post ever. I know it’s annoying but scrolling through reddit found this sub and felt triggered and wanted to share and find out if I was really the asshole. I’ll try my best. (Sorry if it’s really long).

Background info. On our friend ship: I have known my (ex) Friend (let’s call her, N) for over 10 years. I would do anything for her. Everyone who knew us, knew that if I had a choice between 20min hanging out with N, over a whole day with someone else, I’d pick N. Hands down. she was my sister (basically). 

Background info. On N: she was always the girl that guys wanted (she developed early) I didn’t mind, I was happy for her and found it fun to hear about her guy friends and dates.  She was never single for more than 2 weeks, from 8th(13) grade til now (23). I liked being by myself m, so I was never fixated on things like that, I just wanted to be happy with what I have. This meaning I rarely went to her to complain about guys and emotional drama outside of family issues. 
 
Fast forward: I am about 22
I had one pretty bad relationship but got out of it. when I realized how bad it really was, We were already 1.5 years into it and I felt that people would judge me for now having feelings for this guy who wasn’t shit (me 21 at the time, him 26 and he needed my help to pay rent and I nearly went broke and lost my own place in the process, also he was on drugs, I know -_-) so I didn’t tell anyone and it took me 6mo to get out of the relationship I was broken and a shell of who I used to be. I tried to vent to N but she was always talking about her family issues and complaining about things (that she could have easily fixed) so I didn’t want to bother her  and I just listened and supported her when she needed it. (Thinking my dumb relationship wasn’t as important as her sister getting remarried) 

About a year later, N ends things with the guy she was dating/sleeping with (guy in a relationship and living with the mother of his 3 kids, she was a side piece) A month later, she “falls in love” she is now 21 and he is 28. I begin to feel triggered but say nothing and just provide support. 

The BS starts early. He has no car, she does. After a month she has to *ask him* to use her car some days. He never fills the gas. All the while she is still living away from home, and when she leaves to visit he gives her shit about having a good time with her family and not him. Plus a whole array of other BS that no 21 year old (or any woman) should have to deal with. But I support and try to help her, she calls crying at LEAST every 3 weeks crying her eyes out, all hours of the night, to complain about him. I pick up an listen, trying to help problem-solve, every time.  While also sprinkling in “you know you don’t have to put up with this, right” “ you’re awesome and he should see that, if he loves you” “ you sure you guys aren’t moving too fast?” This goes on for about a year.

Then I Went to visit to check up on her because she visits home less and less. That’s when out he is now living with her and doesn’t pay rent. Continues to use her car. Forgets to pick her up from work at 5am (she worked the night shift) leaving her waiting for hours until he wakes up or she decides to call another friend). and blocks her on his social media. 

I take her aside and express my concerns, she denies it “it’s not that bad” “there are so many good times though” “ but he’s really sweet” etc. I don’t want to push because I know how it feels to love someone who is literal garbage. And feeling ashamed of your love so you isolate yourself from family and friends( been there done that, didn’t want her to feel the same way I did) I can tell she truly loves this guy and will do anything for him, So I continue my support.

Until.. I find out her neighbors called the police on them because an argument “got out of hand”. This is when I begin telling her she has got to start thinking what’s best for her. At this point the stress of being with him had made her fail 2 semesters of undergrad and extend her stay (and how much debt she has). She also got diagnosed clinically depressed during the 2nd failed semester. It broke my heart. 

So around Jan. 2018, 1.5 years into their relationship l, I say “as a friend and as someone who loves you, I think you need to get away from this guy he does nothing for you and stresses you out, just try to go 3-6 months without needing to cry in your car because of this guy.” (because he will refuse to leave HER house after an argument because that’s where his ps3 is) she says okay, no problem, their love is getting better and stronger they can do this. 

I don’t hear from her until April. She is finally graduating and has a job and isn’t worrying about anything except him. 
(Around that time I am starting grad school and super stressed, don’t feel like I am smart enough *insecurities blah blah*. My debt is getting ridiculous and gives me anxiety. My family life is crazy, one of my grand parents is developing dementia, find out I have a bunch of half siblings.  I am further away from home than I have ever been and more shit that has me crying all the time) 
In April she complains about him wasting his time trying to be a rapper -_- and I’m fed up. No energy to deal with this almost 2 year problem. I tell her straight up this is ridiculous and she doesn’t deserve all this at such a young age. He is in no way shape or form worth it. 
In the same breathe I tell her how I had been feeling and worrying and what not and how I just wanted her to talk to me more to get some sort of feel of home and support from the only person I can call a sister. 

She ignores me for months. While posting on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat every week. I text/call her, Dm, and Snapchat her but get left on read. I am once again broken, I feel abandoned. I get angry thinking about all the years I was there for her with out asking for anything in return.
She then sends me this obligatory birthday message (on snap chat, not even a text or a call) as if I haven’t been sending her messages for months. In anger and not wanting to ruin my birthday with an argument I write “K” 
A couple days later she asks “are we still friends” 
I basically say yes but I feel like we aren’t best friends anymore and tell her why I feel that way. She gets PISSED. Says I shamed her relationship and never supported her for like our whole friendship and that she was there for me in my “depressed stage” in April. And a whole lot of other stuff trying to make me feel bad and bashing me as a friend. 

And ends with “if we can’t be best friends then we can’t be friends at all” 

I am completely over it and refuse to bash her the way she did me and just say  “ok” and never spoke to her again (not like she has ever messaged me). 

One mutual friend says she doesn’t even care and I’m better off. And another says I should have given her a chance. And I would have had she not bashed me like I was a horrible friend from the beginning. 

Sometimes I feel guilty when my new friends talk about maids of honors and I think about how she was always going to be mine but now I have no one that close. And I wonder should I have just been there for her despite everything? I feel like I was right but every now and then I feel bad for the lost friend ship. 

AITA for dropping her like that? (Btw thanks if you read the whole thing I appreciate any and all comments if I get any lol) 

Idk what TD: LR is but I dropped my friend when I realized It was a one sided friend ship. 

(Also she is no longer with him as of Jan. 2019) 




Edit: So from what I’ve read in the comments here  are some things to clarify:
I didn’t say anything negative about her relationship until shortly after the cops were called to her home because her neighbors feared their altercation would get violent.
I didn’t say anything negative about HIM until 2 years later when she complain about him wanting to be a rapper. 

Yep, I was being passive aggressive on my birthday. No debate on that. I was angry, hurt and acted pretty immature.
I was still open for a friendship which is why afterwards, when she asked if we were still friends, I addressed and explained everything to her as calmly and respectfully as I could. 
To which she responded by saying things that are pretty hard to come back from as a friend. And ending with an ultimatum that either things go back to they were or we couldn’t be friends. And I said ok. Not knowing whether my feelings were justified but feeling rushed I made a gut decision. Idk if it was the right one but it is what it is. 

I do forgive her, but I won’t forget how she treated me and I will keep this in mind if she ever reaches out. 
After listening to you guys I’d give her a chance but only after knowing that she really has changed.

So I really don’t like the idea of my girlfriend posting nude pictures of herself on the internet. She posts on sites like reddit and 4chan, she hides her face but I managed to identify her from her body and her surroundings, I  just learned about this recently, she was doing it behind my back. It's really not ok to me and I do consider it to be cheating. We’ve been dating for 9 months, we’re both 20 and everything was fine up until this point. 

I was pretty mad at her and said I felt like she was cheating on me. She said that I'm being a hypocrite and unfair because I watch porn and look at nudes of girls on the internet myself so I should be ok with it.

"AITA for not trying all the different food on Thanksgiving?. So, I really did not want to go to Thanksgiving dinner, and this was why. This was the first year I went to Thanksgiving dinner at my step mom's family. I really did not want to go but my dad forced me. I told him before we went that I didn't want to try all the different foods. I knew that my step mom was going to try to force me to try everything, she loves to point out how I'm a picky eater and how it annoys her, but I don't see the point of trying ham or sweet potato casserole if I already know that I don't like it. I talked to my dad about this, and he promised me he wouldn't force me to eat anything I didn't want to eat, except for the turkey because according to him, that's the entire reason we're there, so I agreed and I ate the turkey even though I already know I don't like turkey. And my dad stuck to his agreement, too, and he didn't force me to eat anything else I didn't want. 

I admit, I'm a pretty picky eater, and there were a lot of foods on the table that I did not eat, and to others, it may have looked like I didn't eat anything at all, but I did eat a couple of things, including the turkey. But now my step mom is saying that her sister thinks I'm rude for not trying the different dishes. I told her that I didn't see a point in trying a lot of things as I've already tried them in the past, and I didn't like them, and I didn't think her sister's food would be all that different to the versions I ate before. Plus, I feel like she and my dad were already pushing me way out of my comfort zone by forcing me to do Thanksgiving with these people I don't really know, and I feel that asking me to eat everything, too, would have been too much. I told her she should be happy that I even went. 

But now my dad, who was the one who gave me permission not to eat everything, is saying I'm being rude to my step mom, and my step mom is insisting that I'm rude for not eating everything.

"AITA for yelling at a customer service manager?. I'm on mobile, I apologize for formatting. Also, long post. 

Context: I am having *a terrible week*. Shit keeps hitting the fan in ways that is neverending. I ordered birth certificates for both my children because we're flying out of state and I couldn't find the original's. I paid out the wazoo to ensure they would be here before our trip and so that I could track them. I missed the first two deliveries because the person was early the first day, and on the second day I learned I had to be the one to sign for it instead of my brother who was home. On the third day I called and confirmed the time they should be there and the customer service dude just said it'll be delivered within an hour give or take of the delivery time. Well, I had to unexpectedly put my dog down and the delivery guy hadn't shown up yet. He showed up *three and a half hours late* while I was at the vet. I got a notification that it is the final notice and I'll have to pick them up from inside the store. Fine. I drive to the store that night and they tell me the package will be there the next day after 1pm. Okay **fine**. I leave work early to make it there before close just to have them tell me it isn't there. I call customer service and they say I have to drive an hour and a half out of my way to pick them up at their ""main location"" but they're now closed so I have to wait. **fine**. 

Now to today: I attempted to call the main store to make sure my packages were there before making the drive since it'll be three hours round trip with two young children. The only number provided is the 1-800 number that said they can't do anything for me when I called last night. I spent about 15min on hold and then finally got to speak to someone. I asked to be transferred to the store to ensure my packages were there, provided the tracking number and my info, and wanted to just get this over with. They said they can't give out the store number,  they have to put in an inquiry to have the store call me tomorrow morning, but before anything I have to pay the $12 fee for missing the deliveries. 

*I completely lost it*. I started screaming at the guy that the missed deliveries were because their delivery driver wasn't there when they said they would be. I demanded to know *why they even bother* emailing times if they driver is just going to show up whenever they want to anyway. I demanded to know why the packages couldn't have just gone to the store in my town instead of an hour and a half away. I asked how they expect me to waste 3hrs of my day, gas money, and still have to pay a $12 fee because their driver effed up. 

In the end, it got resolved and I was grateful... but the more time that goes by the more I think I may have been TA by turning into a Karen.

"AITA for telling my sister not to give me a ""bad"" present for Christmas?. Background; I'm a middle child. Older sister is 7 years my senior, younger and I are less than a year apart. Grew up poor as fuck, appreciate what I have/what I earn. I'm not spoiled (contrary to popular opinion). We're all grown, we're all neurotypical, we all function ""normally"", we all have jobs (She's got a better income than me, and in-laws that pay 99% of her and her wife's bills, no joke) and the focus is usually on the kids in our family, with one or two things for the adults.

I do my damnedest to give thoughtful, useful, nice gifts that show the receiver that I give a damn and want them to be happy. I put a lot of time and effort into the present if not the wrapping, because I get anxious about the receiver feeling like they're not ""good enough"" for a good gift, like I don't care. This is actually a huge thing for me.

For a long time, my sisters would do it together to try and make me lose my temper or throw a fit, or freak out because it wasn't good enough. I don't. I just throw the stuff away and go about my business because I'm not giving them the satisfaction of knowing I'm upset.

I've gotten back at little sister a few times, given other people things she had her hopes up for. Kept things I didn't want/need that she really, really wanted and ruined them on purpose in front of her. Fussed over little things like saving wrapping paper and delayed opening up stuff she was eyeballing.

My older sister got married and calmed down; she and I are on much better terms all around and usually do well for/with each other. My younger sister, not so much.

I told my younger sister that if she's going to give me something stupid and useless this year, do us both a favor and don't get me anything. She got in her feelings and is trying to turn people against me. Half our family is rolling their eyes and the other half is calling me selfish, greedy, etc.

"WIBTA for confronting my mom for not spending time with me after the birth of my baby?. Throw away.

I'm a mom with a 3 month old and a 2 year old.  

Prior to giving birth, I was hospitalized with pre term labor.  I was in the hospital for over a month and then released for several weeks before my little one was born.  During this time my family was super helpful with my 2 year old.  My mom and sister took her when my D(ear)H had to work.

I gave birth and everyone disappeared.  

Background: after my first was born, my mom was at my house every few days for a few months.  Then she babysat her one day a week.  She has spent loads of time with her.  My sister also visited several times.  Everyone came over, aunties, uncles, grandparents, cousins.  When my sister had kids (she has 3), I made a point to go to her house and do dishes, let her shower, play with older kids.  I tried to be present and helpful.  I did this once a week (3 times a month at least) for an extended period of time.  My mom was also there at least every few days for months.  So we have a pattern of behavior here.  

Until now.

Also, my mom has recently (in the last year and a half) gotten involved in a national organization, runs a chapter, it keeps her pretty busy so she is most often doing stuff for that instead of coming to see me now.

My mom has only come a handful of times since the baby was born.  When she comes it's for less than an hour usually.  She had asked me to drive out to her on multiple occasions.  She lives about 40 minutes from me, which is a lot of driving for the littles, but I've done it a few times.  She is always hinting that I should come over.  I'm an overwhelmed new mom who feels like I can barely shower.  My house is a mess.  My baby has horrendous acid reflux.  I'm thinking WTF?!

I have tried to keep asking for help to a minimum in light of all the help I got before the baby was born.  But when I do ask, it's not worth the effort or I can't count on others being there.

I asked my mom to come over to check on me when DH had to go back to work the first day I was home with both of them alone.  I asked a week in advance.  My mom assured me it was no problem, then called me at 3:30 saying she was still in her PJs and waiting for a package to be delivered.  How was I??  I got off the phone ASAP because I didn't want to break down in tears.  The day had gone well but I was super angry.

I asked them all (mom and sister) to come over to help me get ready for my oldest's birthday party (after they declined watching my oldest so we could construct her present).  They said they would be at least a few hours early.  My sister had gone to see my mom and stayed the night before, had an event in the morning that was over by 9-10, so they baked cookies!!!  And came over about 45 minutes before the party was supposed to start with cookies for everyone!!!  I was a mess.  

My mom has gone to see my sister (I live 40 minutes away, she lives over an hour from my mom) at least as many times as me in the time since I gave birth.  

I'm jealous.  I'm also frustrated.  I am also super pissed that my children don't rank high enough on her calendar for a visit.  She cares more about some stupid organization.  I'm happy she found something she loves, but she won't schedule time with me and I hate it.  I want to tell her we won't see her unless she schedules it ahead and for longer than an hour.

WIBTA if I confronted my mom with this frustration?  Or an I being childish?

My DH just says it won't do any good and just don't rely on her/them.  But I'm really hurt.

PS... Typing all this out, it seems obvious.  However, I'm wondering if I'm being immature and childish.

TL/DR:  I'm frustrated my mom is not visiting my newest baby as much as she has her other grandchildren and pissed that she is not keeping her word when she says she will come.

"AITA for cutting lumber past dark?. Alright so AITA for continuing to make noise past the 10 o'clock noise ordinance? So I'm a stay at home mom of a 5 month old and when I'm not busy with that I've been making wooden Jack o lanterns and other various Halloween decorations and selling them. Our neighbor moved in around the same time I had our baby. She is great, super friendly and basically minds her own business. I think she's 19 so there is nights where her and her friends will be partying sometimes past 2 in the morning. Which is whatever, never really got too out of control. But her dog is the most obnoxious barking 4 legged animal ever. No matter how many times you talk, pet, give treats to this dog she will continue to bark at absolutely nothing. I mean literally NOTHING! For hours. The girl brushes it off and giggles throwing an "" I don't know why she's like this, she's so sweet"" my way every once in awhile. She knows how annoying this dog is and will leave her locked inside her enclosed back porch while at work. Great. This dog hears a leaf fall and it's game on till the owner gets home. Our houses are fairly close and my baby has continuously had issues staying or even falling asleep when this dog is going off during the day. No matter what room I put him in you can still hear it pretty clearly. So this has lead to countless days of a very cranky and tired baby. Not so fun. I've mentioned this to her and she will again just laugh it off. Which I do get that it's during the day time hours and what can she really do about it. (I've suggested getting a kennel and keeping her inside) but she'll just reply with "" I can't do that to my baby, I'm sorry I'll get her to stop"" ) not realizing this dog will continue to bark til she arrives back home.

I'd usually stop at 10. but with how things have been and my baby being overly clingy during the day i haven't been able to get shit done and decided fuck it, and continued to saw wood and use the nail gun well past midnight. The next day when she saw me she was furious, her dog had kept her up all night barking at me and she wasn’t able to sleep. I kind of laughed and said “she’s so sweet, I don’t get why she’s like that” and went back inside. Hours later she sent me a huge message calling me an asshole, saying I can control my actions and what sounds I’m making, I’m being inconsiderate, and not willing to find a compromise” which what? I’ve suggested many things to her in order to help my day out which I didn’t think was a huge deal for her to do. I even offered her my old dogs kennel for free and she was still unwilling to do that to her baby. So some of my friends think I’m being petty, which honestly I am.

"AITA for kicking out a co-worker with two broken legs who was staying with me?. I worked as an accountant for a warehouse. I'm not sure what exactly happened, but one of the employees had some equipment fall onto his legs and breaking them. Anyways, the owner was scared shitless that the claim would be denied and he would be on the hook for this employee's medical bills and would be fined. He could not afford that to happen. I was the one who had to file the worker's comp claim, but I suspect what I was told happened by everyone wasn't what happened. I think they were smoking weed while moving heavy equipment. Among many other reasons, I started to actively look for another job on the down low. The employee had no one to help take care of him and the owner offered to pay me to let him stay with me.

My relationship with the owner seemed to get frosty afterwards and I couldn't figure out why. A few weeks later, he hires me an ""assistant"" that I need to train in everything I know. I start to believe he's planning on firing me, but it doesn't make sense. But I'm ready to ditch the job the minute something better comes up. Out of the blue, he tells me that I am fired.

I confronted him and he denied, but then admitted but claimed that he thought everyone knew I was looking.

"WIBTA for telling my roommmates I don't think they deserve to have our apartment by themselves?. My boyfriend and I recently found out that our roommates (another couple) want to keep our apartment/duplex next lease, but have their brother and his girlfriend move in while we move out. BUT my boyfriend and I wanted to keep the apartment at the end of this lease, and have our roommates move out. 

My reasons why I don't think they deserve it are:

1) I found the apartment. I contacted the landlord, set up a tour, and set up every meeting we had with the landlord before we moved in. I even ironed out the details of us moving in early and pro-rating the rent.

2) My boyfriend and I are the ones who contact our landlord for repairs, even when we don't discover the thing needing to be repaired. Similarly, the landlord has only ever contacted my boyfriend and I with matters relating to the house--not our roommates. 

3) We went through the process of setting up the utilities and the internet. Both of them are under either mine or my boyfriend's name. 

4) We almost entirely furnished the house (save for kitchen appliances, as those were provided, and our roommates bedroom). Every piece of furniture in the living room is ours. Every decoration is ours, including for holidays. We're even the ones who bought the shower curtain. They have provided a dining room table, which is only used to collect mail--not actually for dining.

5) Our roommates complain constantly about money problems. One says he gets ""stress hives"" from money issues, but continues to only work 4-hour shifts three or four times a week. His brother and his brother's girlfriend recently had to move back in with their dad because they could no longer afford their rent. Our rent is $1200; split four ways its $300 each. My boyfriend and I are able to pay $600 each, while our roommates are apparently currently struggling with $300. 


We have issues with them as people, but that is mostly what affects the apartment. I just want to know if it'd be a dick move to tell them they don't deserve to stay in the house, because frankly, I'm pissed that they'd assume they have some sort of entitlement to it.

Edit: to clarify, we all signed the lease. We all pay equal portions of the rent.","ESH, they sound like awful roommates but just telling them to their face that they don't 'deserve' the app is a definitely a dick move.

"AITA for agreeing with my brother when he told my boyfriend he should not talk during family arguments?. I'm 24 and boyfriend is 27. We've been dating for 2 years and a half. We always talked about our family issues very openly and between us we always gave some sort of insight to each other. Still, I never dared to say something directly his family and I always thought he would never do something like this either. 

We went to dinner yesterday at my parents and my younger brother arrived almost at the end of it. My brother and my parents are having issues so this turned into a huge argument. I had already told my boyfriend about what was going on before and he decided to get in the middle of the argument. 

This set off my brother even more and he told my boyfriend that it was not his place to say anything because the issue did not concern him or me. It was between him and our parents and regardless of what I told my boyfriend he still knew nothing about it to speak so freely. At this point I was completely mortified because I could see that my parents were not pleased either. I ended up saying that I wanted to go home and so we did. 

During the car ride my boyfriend asked why I didn't say anything. I told him that my brother was right, it wasn't even my place to say something, much less his place to get into an argument like this. He then said that if it was his family and I he would have said something since he would like me to speak my mind. I told him that I would never do something like this because it was inappropriate and at the end of the day it had nothing to do with us. He tried to argue that the moment my brother said something to him it became an issue with us but I told him he only got what he deserved for inserting himself into something that he should never had.

My answer varies slightly based on how long you guys have been together but not much. 

If they don’t want to have other people chime in on an argument, they should argue in front of other people.  So your boyfriend isn’t an asshole for speaking up in my opinion.

She's currently a lawyer and has been studying for the bar in my state. We talked about living together, a future together, ect when we finally moves to the city where I live. This was her plan before we ever met.

She's currently working double court room (double the normal work load without any incentive) and studying for the bar full time. She warned me prior to her studying that she can get grumpy and become emotionally irrational at times. It's stressful. 

I've been supportive. We talk daily. I bought her premade meals to be delivered weekly so she doesn't have to worry about cooking dinner and studying. I've spent hours on FaceTime asking her test questions to help her prepare.

For Valentine's day I sent her a care package, a card, and a nice text early in the morning. Unfortunately she was having a shitty day at work. I listened to her complaints and frustrations. Did my best to validate her feelings. At one point during the day I FaceTimed her just to say hi. She seemed busy and I told her I missed her but I will let her get back to work. She became annoyed that I was ending the conversation and hung up on me.  I texted her back and said ""I know you wouldn't appreciate it if I hung up on you, I'd like the same consideration as well. I'm sorry you're having a rough day at work"".

The rest of the day goes by and that evening I was disappointed that she had not said or done anything for me on Valentine's day. We have always had a policy of, if something is bothering you, communicate it so we can fix it. So I did, exactly the way she claims she likes to be communicated with.

""I just want to let you know that I'm a little disappointed about today. I felt like you didn't say or do anything for me on Valentine's day. It just hurts a little bit"".

Instead if validating my feelings she tells me that I shouldn't expect anything from her while she's so stressed with the exam. That Valentine's isn't a big deal. She then starts to claim that I'm making her feel like a shitty girlfriend and she doesn't need that stress right now, a week before her test. We end up not talking the rest of the night. 

In the morning I get the message ""hey, we need to talk. I don't think this is going to work out"". I was shocked she wasn't apologizing or at a minimum validating my feelings. I told her  she could have at least sent a sweet message or told she missed me. Everyone has stress in their lives but we should still do common courtesies for the ones we love. She ended the conversation breaking up with me saying maybe she needs someone that understands her better.

Am I the asshole? ","NAH/ESH you need to learn to set expectations better so you're not silently expecting something and then getting mad that she didn't do what you wanted. She needs to learn to validate your hurt feelings. There is no asshole for the breakup. She doesn't want the emotional burden of taking care of another person's feelings right now in her life and it's nothing personal against you. You do seem kinda needy tbh, facetiming someone in the middle of their workday when you know they're busy and stressed, and I can see how it can seem like you call her on your own terms and you end the conversation on your own terms and she doesn't get a say in how the phone call goes. Maybe that's why she felt like you were just ""ending the conversation"" - you were being disrespectful of her time or emotional output at the time. But what do I know. ",1,0,1,0,0
"AITA for calling out a father at a restaurant?. I'll try to make this short because I hate reading long posts on here.

My wife and I went shopping at a mall today and decided to pick up some food at one of the restaurants attached to the mall (not food court, but sit down restaurant). It was around 5pm, so right at the start of dinner rush. Service was fine and our server was incredibly friendly.

Toward the end of our meal, a family (father, mother, and son probably around 8 years old) are seated in the booth behind us. By this time, it was getting a bit busier in the restaurant. It takes maybe 2-3 minutes before the server comes and takes their drink orders. She then went to tend to that and other tables. 

About 5 minutes pass and I hear the father start complaining. ""Why is everything taking so long?"" ""This server is lazy."" ""It's been five minutes, why hasn't she taken our order?"" ""The service here is terrible, they deserve a 4/10 rating."" ""Maybe I need to speak to the manager."" 

It was driving me crazy because it was fucking dinner time and they were busy. My wife and I finish our meal and pay. As we are leaving, I step over their booth and just very kindly address the father ""Excuse me, hi, so we were sitting at the booth behind you, and just so you know, you're a real prick."" And then I walked out before he could respond.

My wife thinks I was totally justified because our server was super nice and kind, but I just wonder if I overstepped myself. So reddit, am I the asshole or does everyone suck (because seriously, fuck that guy)?","Mild ESH. That guy is a royal prick, but it's not a super good look to go around insulting strangers either, even if they do deserve it.

"AITA for not meeting my husband's daughter?. My husband and I have been together 6 years, married 3. His daughter is 8 years old. He was never married to his daughter's mom, but they have a civil relationship and have shared custody where he has his daughter M-W or M-Th, and her mom has her the rest of the week.

When my husband and I met I made it explicitly clear to him that I am not interested in having children or being a stepmother. We tried to keep things casual, but ended up falling in love and I honestly can't imagine life without him. We've gotten around this by me keeping my condo that I had when we met. When his daughter is over, I go stay at my condo. I'm an introvert and have a very time consuming hobbies, so this works well for us. I get a break for a few days a week (we still chat and text) and then spend the rest of the week in our home with him.

I am aware that this is unusual, so I don't talk about it much to people besides family, but as his daughter has gotten older, she's become curious about me. We've never met but she knows about me and has never seemed particularly interested in me and is happy to have her dad to herself, but now that she's asked some questions about me, her mom, who was previously thrilled about our arrangement, thinks that it's selfish and weird. I think her mom is being hypocritical; I think she was thrilled at first that I was being 'sent away' when their daughter was over, but now she's finding a new way to resent me when she realized we're all happy this way.

Is it really that bad? I had a stepfather who I hated for all of my childhood and I would've been thrilled if he kept his distance.","ESH - not the daughter clearly, but he should never have pursued someone not wanting kids when he had one and you for doing the same.

"AITA for getting annoyed when my neighbor parks in front of our house?. This is something that is not as much hitting me but rather my family, as I can´t drive and am not really affected by this situation. 

So, we have a neighbor on the opposite site of the street. My family currently has two cars that they use and while one of them can be parked in the yard, the other one has to be parked somewhere else. We usually do this in front of our house. That is pretty common in our street, basicially anybody has a specific space they park in. 

Now comes our neighbor into play. The neighbor has two bigger cars which need space to be moved around. He has garages he can park them in. However, due to his cars being big he appearantly can´t drive the cars out if someone is parking on the opposite site of the street. No problem, my family just parks the car a little bit down the street in front of our house. Only problem is he likes to park there too, when he´s too lazy to drive his car into the garage. On more than one occasion when my parents came back from a marathon the parking space was taken up by him, so my parents either had to park up the street or park on the opposite site of the streets where his garages are. Which he then complains about and puts pieces of papers on the cars telling us how shitty the parking is. 

He is allowed to park in ""our"" parking space by law, just as my family doesn´t have any obligation to not park on the opposite site of the street. I just get really annoyed by this. He is perfectly able to park his car in his garage or his yard but is appearantly too lazy to do so, while my family doesn´t park on the opposite site of the garages on most occasions.  

I know this is an extremely petty argument, I just find it so rude that he thinks he can park whereever he wants but gets annoyed when he takes up parking space and we have to carry heavy groceries down the street just because he can´t be bothered to park on his property. 

AITA for thinking this way? I know I should not get annoyed by this.","Even though he's being an asshole as well, he's allowed to park in front of your house. I don't want to call you an asshole but it's such an inconsequential problem, there's no reason to make a big deal out of it. Just park in front of his house and if he confronts your family, tell him not to park in front of yours. Also I'd plant a camera so you can see if he potentially damages your car. Ik it sounds overly cautious but if he's getting upset at you parking in front of his house don't be surprised if he does something to your car. ",1,0,1,0,0
"AITA because I procrastinated on a group assignment but my contribution still landed us with an A?. So I'm in my senior year of highschool and about a month back I was writing a report on a chemistry experiment I did with a good friend. The experiment went horribly wrong but that wouldn't affect the grade of the report. I was supposed to write down the results and a longer, more text oriented part. Now, I have a short attention span and tend to procrastinate a lot, usually it doesn't matter because I'm a fast worker. This friend and I had a fight about me procrastinating a year before on a similar assignment and she got pretty mad. 

So it's a day before it is supposed to be handed in and I've barely started. She tells me to write down the hypothesis becuase she didn't make one before the experiment like she said she would. I was a bit annoyed because I didn't make one either, she should've done it. I said that I would, I would just have to write one like I didn't know the results. 

So it's about 8 pm and she texts me. She is furrious that I haven't started yet. I honestly forgot so I became super apologetic. I started writing and was done at about midnight. The day the report was supposed to be handed in she comes up to me and asks angrily if she should add anything. I take a look and see that she has missed writing down multiple important things. In the end she was done after I was done but she still got mad. The parts i wrote ended up getting As but hers didn't.

She hasn't spoken to me since except for once two weeks ago. She said that she rather didn't want me to join on a trip with a few friends to a harvest festival because she didn't see us as friends anymore. To be fair, we would probably have lost touch after highschool but that still stung hearing from a friend I've known since 1st grade. AITA?","ESH.

"AITA for not listening to my dad?. Ok, so ik Im probably not the a-hole but I just want to make sure

Background

I was 15 years old and Im a female. I don't have a good relationship with my parents and I often get into arguments with them. My dad is a know-it-all and thinks he's always right, which in most cases he is, but he also doesn't seem to listen to my opinion. He was raised in a military family so he has this attitude/voice that makes you be quiet. Basically, you just don't mess with him.

The story

In mid-October, I went to a yearly fair with my mom and my brother. I remember last year I got a henna tattoo and I wanted to get one again this year. I got my mom to wait as I got a HT that I paid for. After it was done the lady doing my HT asked if I knew what to do afterward.

I said yes because I did this last year, but later I found out I got the directions mixed up in my head. Last year the lady who did the HT said to let it dry for 3 hours b4 going on any rides, and then wash it off in 24+ hours. I 4got about the take it off in 24 hours part and thought u wait for it to dry and then take it off.

When we got home, about 2-3 hours later, my dad let us in and he noticed the HT and said something about keeping it on for a while. I thought he meant a couple of hours, which I already did. So after about 30 mins I washed it off and was shocked to see it faded.

I yelled downstairs, ""Hey dad! My henna tattoo didn't work!""

He yelled back angerly, ""You weren't supposed to wash it off yet!""

""But I waited for over 3 hours like I'm supposed to!""

I don't remember the exact exchange but it was basically him getting angrier as I tried arguing that I thought I was right, until he told me to look it up, which we both did.

I found out you were supposed to wait for over a day and that you weren't supposed to wash it off. A simple mistake, right? Nope.

A few minutes later, he called me downstairs. He was sitting in the living room and called me over to stand in front of him. Then he starts saying how he was right and that I should have listened to him and not washed it off. I didn't mind that because he did that often but it was when he went to the name-calling that bothered me the most.

He called me an a\*\*hole, a know-it-all, and some other things, but the one that bothered me most is when he called me a ""stupid a\*\* punk"". Now Im a sweet, innocent, kind, nerd/book worm who doesn't break rules. Being called that by my dad just broke me (now that Im typing it out it doesn't seem as bad tho)

I asked if I could go to my room when he paused and he told me, ""No!"" and to ""not interrupt him!""

I couldn't hold it in any longer... I cried. I hate crying, especially in front of my parents. I started shaking and sat in a chair. My dad asked why I was sitting and I told him I felt sick. After that I didn't really listen to what he was saying and, eventually, he allowed me to go to my room.

So reddit... AITA?

"AITA for causing my roommate and former close friend for never talking to me again?. Okay so there's a bit to unpack here I guess. I met my friend way back in 2012, freshman year of college. We ended up being roommates in college and just being really good friends. I ended up dropping out but we kept in constant contact since then. 

On more than one occasion, we've had discussions on how we'll be probably friends for life. We played video games together all the time, and we also went to go see each other over time. We lived about 4 to 5 hours apart, across state lines and such. So he had the idea for me to room with him again and he gets me an IT job. This meant a lot to me as I don't have a degree. I was beyond excited to move here. I fully expected we would study to get promoted, workout, and go out together and practice hitting on girls and stuff. I guess I was naive or an idiot to assume this. 

He introduced me to a group of friends that I felt that I got along great with. Maybe I was a bit too boisterous when I was drinking and people have told me I can be overbearing. The problem was he never wanted to do anything else but play video games..I wanted to go out and explore the new city I was in. And yeah I probably should've respected his decisions but Im in a new city where I didn't know anyone and I didn't want to just go out by myself. 

The other issue is that we lived AND worked together on the same shift. So this is a lot of time with one person together obviously. And given that I'm in a new area without knowing anyone but him, I also wanted to hangout his friends. Sometimes he'd be there sometimes he wouldn't. As time went on he got more and more standoffish. Not including me in plans, even specifically asking me to not go to a friend's house for his birthday. 

One day I took a food item without asking, a food item that I've taken with asking beforehand without an issue but I was in a rush. He gave me attitude for it, like really escalating it. I gave him attitude back. This was over text.  Yeah I probably shouldn't have done this in hindsight. However, this was about 2 or 3 months ago. He has since punched a hole in the wall and has not spoken a single word to me. He blatantly ignores me, and visibly gets angry when I even say hello to him...we live in the same apartment. At work he will completely ignore my existence, going out of his way to either avoid me or saying the bare minimum needed. He won't even tell me what the issue is, beyond the food item. 

Again I think this is insane and feel free to ask questions because maybe I'm leaving something out here. This is just such a hard position to be in because I literally don't have anyone here, it's gotten me beyond depressed because of how lonely I am. It's just me. I have no family or friends here my only contact has completely shut me out, including from his friends. It's extremely uncomfortable living in the same area as this. It all doesn't make sense because this is someone I once considered a brother. ","Both assholes here, edge to your roommate for poor communication. 

You are right, working together and living together is a LOT.  Add wanting to socialize with the same person as well and that can become too much. Everyone needs space sometimes. (I worked and lived with one of my roommates for 7 years. We had a couple of blowouts but are still friends today.)

Taking your roommate’s food without asking is shitty behavior. Just because he didn’t say anything until your blow-up doesn’t mean he was okay with it. Honestly, it’s clear that he wasn’t okay with it (otherwise he wouldn’t have snapped at you). This is another indication of your roommate’s poor communication habits. Slamming stuff around and punching walls is not okay. He needs to learn to speak up when things bother him before it gets to explosive anger stage. 

At this point, you are an adult and should be working on building a social circle outside of him and his social circle. I’m not saying you won’t be able to be friends with his friends as well, but maybe ease up on hanging out with them for a bit. You do admit to being ‘too boisterous’ when drinking and that some find you ‘overbearing’, so it could be that they need a break from you as well.

"AITA for cuddling with a girl even though I don’t like her.. This story isn’t about me, but it involves my best friend and I am struggling to decide whether or not he is the asshole. 

Here’s a few things to know about my friend J.  J loves to cuddle with people. He calls it platonic intimacy. He just likes being near anyone and he doesn’t have to have an emotional connection to them. He also dated this girl, M, when he was younger, but she essentially ditched him for someone else. 

This year, J and M started to hang out more and more and we’re becoming friends again. They would hang out all of the time and, eventually, they started to cuddle. One day, M kissed J and he wasn’t really into it, but he went along with it to continue with the cuddles. They went on with this for a few months until M told J that she liked him and wanted to date him. J said he did not like her in that way and just wanted to be friends. He said he would like to still hang out and cuddle, but he didn’t want to kiss her or do any other romantic things with her. 

She continued to pursue him and would still kiss him and try to be his girlfriend. He continually told her he wasn’t interested, but he liked having someone to cuddle and hang out with. One day, at the skating rink M was there while J and I were hanging out and started to cry because J was hanging out with me and not her. She then told all of her friends that I was trying to date J and that I was a whore, even though I have a boyfriend of 2 years. This made J very upset and he essentially told her that he would never date her, he doesn’t like her personality, he doesn’t find her attractive, and he thinks that all she wants is attention. He told her he just likes to cuddle with her and nothing more. 
She cried over this, but, after a few days, she wanted to hang out, cuddle, and kiss him again. This happened multiple times, him telling her he isn’t interested and her ignoring it, and she continues to go back. 

All of my other friends say J is the asshole for continuing to cuddle with her even though he has no feelings, but I say he has done nothing wrong because he has made it very clear that he does not like her in that way on multiple occasions. It is her choice to keep coming back and keep getting her. 

So, is my friend the asshole?","This is confusing. I would say nobody is really an asshole, but everyone is acting stupid.

"WIBTA if I asked my mom to return an expensive Christmas gift?. So for Christmas this year my mom got me a designer bag, which was around $500.

I feel I might be stubborn, but I feel like I should stand with my conviction. Let me know, am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

Warning, this is a bit of a read.

For background, my mom isn't the smartest of people. She is spineless and a great procrastinator but I love her. She had a friend (his name is Kyle, changed) who she had a kid with. She suggested that they were still friends despite his failure to attend the child or even show up to the hospital during her labor, which I witnessed. Kyle, in my opinion, was an asshole. Not only because he was an absent father, but he took the victim role in all arguments my mom put up against him. But this post isn't about Kyle.

Despite the obvious signs, my mom stayed with him. Both me and my father had warned her and told her to get away from the guy because he was a scumbag, etc etc that didn't end well. They don't talk anymore and she was left in the dust as the two of us thought.

Jumping forward, my mom lives in a two-story house that my dad owns and rents the top floor to some guy (we'll call him James). James had lived up there long before my dad bought the house and he had a girlfriend for about four months. Not long after my mom moved in, though, she started to get really friendly with the upstairs tennant, even though she knew that he had a girlfriend and that she was being a homewrecker. This made me lose a lot of respect for my mom, even when I tried to convince myself that she was an adult and could make her own decisions. This was something that really bothered me, enough to make me stay out of her house for a few weeks before Thanksgiving.

On Thanksgiving day, I went to a party with my entire family at my Grandparents house. Big, busy and very full of commotion. I drove myself up to the house alone and my mom drove up my two little brothers, who both stay with her at her house. The party was great, stayed there for a good amount of time. My mom on the other hand wanted to go home because my youngest brother, the child of Kyle, was acting up. She yelled to me from across the room to drive my middle brother (14) home because he wanted to stay longer.

My car didn't have the gas to drive the distance between my mom's house and my dad's house, not to mention the thirty minute drive back from my grandparents. I told her that I couldn't drive my brother home and told her no. She became angry and escalated, threatening me and yelling from across the room in front of family. Long story short, that was embarrassing and I ended up needing to get money from a grandparent for the gas because I didn't have money on me and my mom refused to lend me cash before leaving. Between then and Christmas, we didn't talk much unless she needed me to watch my little brother.

Finally, getting to the height of the argument, Christmas day. Another party at my grandparents house that I had gone to, the same driving situation as Thanksgiving. Had a wonderful time with family but I had to leave early because I had to work the next morning and I didn't want to be really tired. I went downstairs, where my brother was with my aunt and cousins, to tell him I was heading out. My aunt, who came with her boyfriend and three kids, had no way to get home except to wait for my grandparents (moms side) to finish playing cards and driver her home. Like me, she and boyfriend had work, which I understood. I agreed to drive the two of them and their kids home.

But my mom had other plans; the moment she heard that I was heading out, she asked me to drive my brother home. My brother hadn't asked to stay longer, but she knew he wanted to leave. Again, like Thanksgiving, I said no. Not because I didn't want to, but because my tiny Ford Fusion wasn't going to drive more than four people, let alone six excluding me. This put off my mom, and she demanded that I do so. But, again, I declined. What she said next took me so off guard that I thought she was joking:

""Drive your brother home in the trunk, then, I dunno!""

At first I just laughed because I thought she was entirely joking. Driving home on Christmas by itself with so many passengers was dangerous alone because of common drunk drivers, but with my brother in the trunk with the many presents and bags? That wasn't going to happen. Once I realized she was being serious, I firmly told her that I wasn't going to do that. Not only did it threaten the legality of my driving and my license, but it threatened my little brother's life because if I had gotten into a car accident he would die. In that, I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

Following some back and forth, she threatened to call my dad and have him force me. Which, thinking back on it, I should've just waited on the call and had him tell her off there and then. But I am deathly scared of my dad, and on Thanksgiving I had gotten in trouble with him about what happened then. Didn't want that to happen twice, so I walked away to start my car. Hoping she would forget about it if she thought for a second.

Coming back in, she demanded, again, that I drive my brother home *in the trunk*. Though she went on to say that she got off the phone with my dad and that he told me to do as she said. Shocked and utterly in disbelief, I loaded my car full of people, bags, and inevitably, my brother in the trunk.

I drove for over ten miles under five miles under the speed limit having a panic attack, trying not to burst into tears in the front seat. Scared of getting my brother killed until I dropped off my aunt and put him in the front seat.

&#x200B;

Skip ahead some days, I learned my dad never spoke with my dad on the phone and he agreed that I shouldn't have done anything like put my brother in the trunk. This made me furious, and since then, I refused to say a word to my mom. I felt cheated and offended that she would put her son in harms way to win that argument, or prove a point... I wasn't sure what she was thinking.

&#x200B;

TLDR; mom forced me to drive my brother in the trunk because of overcrowding, refused to see her since

"AITA if I don't go to my own birthday ""party""?. Hi!

Throwaway account just in case.

A little bit of context: I have this group of ""friends"" (not sure I can still think of them as that) that I went to college with. In general we have had fun times, in parties, watching films from time to time in theaters and drinking beer.

So, tomorrow is my birthday (at the time of writting it is not 19 yet, not sure about other countries) and on Wednesday of this week I told this group if we could meet up during the weekend and celebrate it with some beer. The group has been very active for the whole 4 years of college, except for this Christmas, but then we all have works now and we have finished college so that's understandable. The thing is that, of the whole group of 10-12 people, only 3 answered. I was a little bit taken aback because I would have prefered that the rest would have at least answered, but hey, everyone lives their own lives.

I said that the day that suit the best for the 3 guys we could meet, and it was said that saturday 19:00. So, Saturday arrived and I said this morning through the whatsapp group that they remembered that today at 19:00 we would meet. No one responded till 17:00 or 18:00, and it was 2 out of the 3 guys saying that they would be late. I asked how much time would they be late, and they say that they could be there around 21:00.

That really really pissed me off, because they warned me with very little time. So I decided that fine, let them go at that hour, but I will not go myself, puting whatever excuse I could after they where already together. And so 21:00 arrived, I finished my dinner and went to the mobile phone. I had already 5 calls, but I ignored them and just said that I would not be going, that tomorrow I had luch with the family and it was too late. And they started saying that how could I not come, that the whole group was there (they included photo, so it is true) even tho no one had said absolutely anything to me. I just wished them a fine evening, and the messages have been along the lines of ""I can't believe you"" and ""You are from another world, how can you not come to your own birthday party"".

So AITA? I have been thinking for quite a while now on just leaving this country and moving to Cnada or Norway, without any warnings and cutting all contacts, and this have made me realize that I might need to do this, since I believe this is not a way of respecting someone, so I can't call them friends anymore. And we have a journey in two weeks time that it was supposed to be the ""group's journey"" to another city in Europe, and the flight is already paid but... I really don't want to go now, I know that they will resent me. But if I stop hanging out with them, I really will not have anymore friends to go out with, the other 3 groups of friends I had I had to left them because similar reasons.","ESH

This is not good communication on anyone's end. If it hurt you that they were not being responsive and were letting you know last minute that they'd be late, you should have expressed that and told them you were cancelling. Just not showing up is immature. They also sound like their communication was shoddy but the way to address that is not with MORE poor communication.

> the other 3 groups of friends I had I had to left them because similar reasons.

"AITA for not letting my brother pet my cat?. Basically, I got a cat recently and I took responsibility for her. I do everything for her and I love her so much, but recently when I ask my brother to help me bring the food inside or carry something for me he says “not my pet, not my problem” and makes me do it myself (just to let you know I am a 4’ 10” 16 year old girl who, although is doing martial arts, I can’t carry heavy stuff or more than 2 larger things at a time. Larger things such as my cats bed and litter box.) I have made up a rule now that my brother cannot pet my cat because it’s not his pet, not his problem. If he doesn’t want to help me with simple tasks for the cat then he can’t get the benefits of me having a cat. I’m low key scared that I’m an ass for doing this or if I’m doing the right thing.

Edit: I want to just say that my cat doesn’t like other people because she is very shy and still needs time to adjust to her new home so I’m not doing anything bad to her if she doesn’t want people to be near her rn. 

Also my brother and I are still very close and nice to each other so it hasn’t really affected our sibling relationship at all, at least from what I can see. We still hang out and annoy each other whenever and we don’t mind it. The rule was only when my cat is in the house and my brother comes out from his room upstairs just to pet my cat. 

Also also, I’ve apologised to my brother for how I was acting and that if he is gentle and not loud he can pet my cat (if she lets him), just then and he basically brushed it off saying that it’s okay but if I get him some of my chocolate then I’d be his favourite sibling again (lol wow).

"AITA for not punishing my niece (15f) for ""peeking and chatting"" with the college aged guys who live behind me as they were in their pool?. I guess it's relevant but I'm 26f. So for some background my sister is going through an ugly, ugly divorce from her husband who none of us have ever liked. They did however agree that is was best for my niece, AJ, to be somewhere else this summer so I said I'd love to take her with me. I am in a phd program and completely burnt out so I decided to take the summer completely off and just hang out with her. She is an amazing kid and incredibly extroverted and has made a ton of friends her age. She really wants to be 21 and while she's very cute, she's obviously a teenager. 

I live in a rapidly gentrifying college area neighborhood in my grandparents old house. Most of the houses are airbnbs now but a few are still college rentals. Such is the house behind me. It's sort of like a ""frat house extension"" as all the guys that live there are in the same frat. They are totally cool and I'll occasionally hang out and drink beer, watch football, etc... they do have a above ground pool and one or more of them is in the pool near 24 hours a day. 

So last week I did have to go into work and I came home and found AJ and a 2 friends literally peeking through the slats in the fence toward the ""frat"" house. I asked what they were doing and she said the frat guys were so hot. I was like that's normal but peeking is not cool. They sort of giggled and agreed to not to it again. 

I ran into one of my neighbors and he said that he wanted to let me know that AJ and a friend had actually hopped the fence and wanted to ""hang out"" and stayed there for several minutes despite being asked to leave. He said AJ was sort of a teenage version of flirty and made them all uncomfortable but the guys were polite and were able to walk them through the yard to leave. I asked if it was a big deal to them, he said not at all, he just didn't want any misunderstandings. I said no problem. 

AJ's dad (my soon to be ex brother in law) called me this weekend to see how she's doing. I pretty much explained the situation like I did above. He absolutely freaked out and wanted to know what I hadn't called him right away. I said it really didn't seem like that big of a deal to me and she was just being a normal kid. He wanted to know who the ""sluts"" where that were talking her into this, I said I think actually AJ was the one that hopped the fence first. He wanted to know how I was punishing her, I said I wasn't. He screamed at me that he was coming to get her (he lives 19 hours away). So I called my sister and she's mad that I ""created a situation"" that could now be used against her. I told her I was really sorry that I was just gone for 2 hours. Now she claims to be on her way to pick up AJ before soon to be ex can get here. 

I guess to prepare for this cross country death race that ends in my driveway it would help to know if I'm the asshole or not?","ESH.

You should uh... be kinda wary of a teenager actively taking steps to pursue older men. Thankfully the frat guys weren't creeps but this could've went *hella* sideways if you just so happened to come home and A.J. was gone. However you don't necessarily need to punish her so much as just give her an explanation.

"AITA for wanting to keep my bonus to myself?. So my partner (B) of 8 years and I are buying an apartment together in a few weeks after living together for a number of years. We're paying equal amounts for both the downpayment and the mortgage. In the country we live in, the government has a few schemes to help first time buyers where they will top up your savings by a percentage as a bonus when you buy a property. I have used one of these schemes, B has not.

&#x200B;

I'm going to fudge the numbers both for simplicity and anonymity but let's say that the bonus I'm getting is 10% of the total downpayment. We both have at least the 50% amount from savings. I consider the government bonus to be mine, meaning my side will be 40% savings and 10% bonus. However, B considers it to be ""free money"" that I've put no effort in getting therefore it should just be shared. B's opinion is that the only fair thing to do is to take the 10% bonus and split it between us, so we both pay 45% each from savings. But my issues with that are:

&#x200B;

1. I put in the work saving in that account for years, even when going through financial difficulty, by always treating the account as a priority
2. Essentially I would be paying 55% of the downpayment if that was the case, or in other words giving B a gift of 5% which I can't justify
3. B continually brings up that I paid a lesser amount (which we agreed on) of household bills while I was earning significantly less, ""allowing"" me to continue saving in the account. I didn't ever ask for or agree to a reduction so that I could continue saving, only because of the extreme disparity in our income at the time.
4. B was also eligible for the scheme and could have easily paid in close to the same amount that I did, so technically B has lost us potential bonus money.

&#x200B;

On the flipside, we need to buy a large appliance and B can get a discount through their job. B asked me to transfer half the amount to them, and I asked what that amount would be after the discount. B told me that the bonus was theirs since they get it through work therefore I should send half the pre-discount value. I responded that effectively B would be making a profit off my contribution, but B seems to think these situations are exactly the same.

&#x200B;

So Reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit since people are commenting on me nickel and diming - that may be the case but this apartment is almost wiping out my savings while B will still have a fair amount left over. In terms of furnishing, decorating, and a big and badly timed vacation we're going on later this year, losing out on half of the 10% amount would be pretty damaging to my finances.

&#x200B;

Our finances are also totally separate at the moment, but in the near future we're going to join some of them to have a common pool of money instead of having to claim contributions to joint expenses.","ESH

"AITA for going off on my GF when she called me a bad pet owner?. So to start off my girlfriend and I share a dog. I work at a police department and saved him from the pound as a puppy despite living in a no-pets property. I pay for his food, vet bills, and half of his toys and equipment like leashes.

My girlfriend is in college and works part time. I pay for her meals when we are together, pay for gas, tutor her, and even do some of her schoolwork for her and teach her the concepts afterwards because she procrastinates a lot. In return, she takes care of our dog when she’s not in school, cleans my place up on occasion, and promises that she’ll get a good job when she’s out of school so I can work on my business and look into becoming an EMT (lower pay than my current job). We live separately.

This morning, following a 12 hour shift of bullshit and spring breakers,I stayed up for her to stop by and drop off Fido on her way to school. I called her on the way over and at some point she said something about she wanted to sell our dog yesterday. I asked why and she said to give it a better home than what I provide, and said she only refused to sell him because she (correctly) thought I’d be pissed. She then said she thought I was a bad dog owner. I exploded.

Every day Fido gets at least 20 minutes of play time no matter how tired or busy I am. He often gets more. Up until today, he had the whole yard to run in freely and was visited daily by my niece while I sleep in addition to our daily 20 minutes of play/walkies. He is going to have to spend some time in his 5x10 kennel the next few days as a pool is being put in and he cannot roam freely in the dig site without being supervised, and she cited this and the fact that I don’t take him to the dog park as reasons why I’m a bad owner. Apparently the dog park is leagues better for a dog’s mental health than walking, even if you’re nocturnal and can only go at times no other dogs are there. She also doesn’t accept the fact that I walk him or play with him daily despite the fact she’s never here to see it.

I was triggered to say the least. I brought up the tutoring, the money I give her, called her an ungrateful smartass, everything in the book. I said something along the lines of “How can you even say that to me right now without realizing what a huge piece of shit it makes you”. She at some point said she didn’t care what I thought and now we’re not talking to each other.

We’re generally happy together but this is a recurring argument (she does not think I ever spend time with him for some reason) that I’m looking to put to rest. 

Am I the Asshole for going off on her so harshly?

Am I the Asshole for giving insufficient care to Fido or is what I can give enough?

"WIBTA for going to the gym instead of spending that time with my child ?. I’m a full time student & full time (single) mum. Child goes to daycare less than 30hr/week. Mum stops by (we live on her way to work) about 2-3 times a week usually anytime between 4:30-5-30 ish. I asked if she would mind picking child up from care on Fridays at 4:30 & stay at home with child until 5:15 so that she had enough time to get to work. Said it was fine, asked if I was doing extra study. I said no I wanted to join gym, it was for “me time”. Mum commented that I get enough “me time” at uni & if I wanted to go to the gym I should go during my study hours instead. 
Now I feel like shit for wanting to spend time away from child by going to gym. 

Full time study is meant to be 40hr/week (lectures & self directed combined) Currently I’m in lectures for 16, I have 8hrs of study time at uni either between before or after lectures & I travel between daycare & uni takes 4hrs/week. My extra study hours are when child day naps or goes down for night. I was planning to gym 3x/week for an hour each time, limiting loss of study/extension of child’s hours @ care. 
Daycare hours would extend by 1 on Monday morning, we would use the gym crèche on Thursday because that’s our home day, & Friday I could have extended daycare hour by 1 but I asked Mum instead thinking she would want to as she is usually visiting us around that time anyway. Which, it wasn’t a problem until it was for “me time”.

"AITA For considering ending a 16 year friendship?. Backstory: So my friend and I have been best friends since we were kids. Most of our friendship has been long distance since her family moved out of state. We have been there for each other through everything...well up until recently. 

As adults, our friendship went from talking every day to maybe once a week at most. When we do talk, it's always very one-sided and she talks for most of the phone call. When it's my turn, she always seems disinterested. For instance, I was talking to my sister about this very issue and the friend texted me saying we could try to talk. I was excited and talked a lot, but she was silent or preoccupied so I felt like an ass by the end of the call, which lasted about 10 minutes. I wouldn't be so sad about it, except she only will talk to me when shes driving home from work. She won't call on the weekends or evenings. She won't have a conversation through text, most of the time if I text her I dont get a response at all. Even when I have gone through some serious mental health problems, she still didn't put forth any effort to reach out, it was all me. I don't usually reach out after work or on the weekend anymore, she has a 6 month old and I know that must be time consuming. But now I dont really reach out at all.

"WIBTA if I don't go to my dad's wedding?. (My first post let me know if I should fix anything.)

&#x200B;

So a little backstory so you know the circumstances of the situation:

My parents split up a long time ago, when i was around 12, due to my father cheating on my mom. We lived abroad during that time so me and my mom moved back and dad continued to live abroad. I have had a rocky relationship with him due to us not seeing each other a lot. Besides that the women he cheated with moved in with him within a year or two after my parents split up. Fast forwards a few years, I was just 18 and my parents finally get their official divorce. My dad needs to pay child support to me, we did not want to involve lawyers and tried to come to an agreement together. Since I had a hard time figuring out what I would need I asked my dad multiple times to come with an offer, he never did. My mothers lawyer suggested it might be beneficial if she could represent me, and I agreed to let her do that. When my dad found out he became furious saying how 'I chose my mothers side' , and some other things. This was obviously never my intention and I tried to explain that, but I couldn't get through to him or he didn't understand or i don't know. But after that he distanced himself from me, and eventually broke off our contact.

I still have to update him every three months on my studies until I am 23 (in turn I get my child support). But I also send him birthday and Christmas cards every year, and recently I have send him some texts to update him in between the emails in the hopes that he warms up to me again.

Now yesterday I notified my dad through text that I was selected to go aboard for my studies next semester (I got my first choice Hong Kong and I am very happy). He then asked me if he could call me, which was shocking to me since I haven't spoken to him in almost three years. He told me that he was happy for me, and that he was going to remarry. He would be marring the women he cheated with. He did want to me to be at the wedding but the wedding will be held (in Swiss, where we lives) during the semester I am in Hong Kong.

&#x200B;

On one hand I am very happy that he wants to reconnect, but I dont know how I feel about the wedding. I do not hate the woman he will be marrying, but I also do not like her. I do not want my old feelings or his choice in women stand in the way of our future relation. Furthermore, I would have to fly in for the weekend and going to Hong Kong is amazing but also financially straining for me.

"AITA for not wanting to help?. My husband and I have a friend who lives around the corner. We do a lot to help her family out and now I'm starting to feel taken advantage of. I have 3 kids of my own who are very little (all under 6 and one is an infant)- relevant to things.

I take her and her kid to school every morning since she doesn't drive and it's too cold to walk. They live around the corner so I don't mind. It only adds an extra minute. But once a week I take the kid to school without either parent because there is another kid that doesn't go to daycare that day and my vehicle isn't big enough for everyone- only seats 6. It's not a huge deal but it does make things a bit more intense with 4 kids especially in the cold. 

A few times a week I watch one of the kids after school for about 3 hours. I'm not being paid, which again not a huge deal. They don't have a lot of money and we are financially stable. But this kid has some behavioural problems. We work through them and tell the kid appropriate ways to express their feelings, using manners, etc. that my kids already (minus the baby) know how to do and do effectively usually- they're kids they aren't perfect. 

Now, some mornings after dropping the kids off she says ""oh I have an appointment at (wherever) in 15 minutes can you take me there?"" At which point I feel obligated because that's a pretty big time crunch so I do even if I have other things going on because I can usually make it on time.

"AITA for implying to my mother that I would have sex with a drug addict?. Okay long story. (For context we are black)

I had a pretty long winded conversation with my mother yesterday. We aren’t on bad terms, but I feel like I might’ve said a thing or two to set her off.

We decided to hang out today and we went out to eat. We were talking about Frederick Douglas. I mentioned he was actually biracial (To her surprise) and we kinda went in on the subject of interracial relationships in the United States

I also mentioned Douglas's affair with a German Journalist. She was interested, and asked me to talk more about it. I explained how it happened, how they broke up, and how the woman offed herself in the middle of Paris after news reached that he married another white woman.

Her face scrunched up when I said that.

I mentioned on the side that I’m pretty sure my maternal great grandfather or grandmother was white. I pick up on her change in attitude and asks what was wrong.

I assumed it was over what happened to the woman. Instead she told me people feel like Douglas is actually a hypocrite for dating a white woman and marrying another

I just up and say those people were stupid.

Mom says there are usually people who feel you can never be for your own race if you date outside of it. She felt like most black celebrities who were dating outside their race were just trying to parade their white wife/husband around as if it was top class. I get what she’s saying here (A black male slave would probably have the best hope for his child if it’s mother was white, and they  were in the north for example)

When I say that’s pretty stupid though she agreed. All these people meant to say was “Oh, you’re my race, how dare you have sex with other people, you’re supposed to have sex with me”.

She insisted it wasn’t all about sex and dating. I still think it was. Since you can’t exactly choose who shows interest in you.

The only girls who ever liked me and the only ones I’ve liked were white. This does not mean I have a fetish for white girls.

And honestly, I’m not much of a catch myself. I’m pretty short (5'8) not that built and my voice is a wreak. I can’t expect to be that picky about who I date.

Mom suggests I still have standards. Not to be around any unpleasant people. Asks if I would have sex with a drug addict right?

I’m daydreaming when she says this. She takes this as me saying “Yes”

When I actually catch her question I can’t provide an exact answer. I would never know if I were having a Stand with a drug addict, and even then I’m not sure I should be picky.

She explains she wants me to have standards, and insists I find a good black woman for myself. I tell her I’m not this super attractive limber dude like she believes I am. We ended it there went on talking about something else. 

She’s obviously concerned for me not associating myself with anyone dangerous but I’m not much. I’m willing to believe there are people out there who like me and I don’t care if they’re blue, green, yellow, pink, white or brown.",I’m so confused,0,0,0,1,0

What apparently happened was one of the night shift people got fed up, threw their orders in the trash and walked out mid shift. That, caused a huge backup of orders, then soon after someone had to go home sick. So when my shift got there it was an absolute shit show. 

I was off Monday and Tuesday, so this morning when I came in the story was out about what happened. The person who quit midshift was upset because a request off they had was denied. Being upset at the boss for that, they decided to just quit and leave without telling anyone.

Upon hearing why she quit one of my coworkers who didn't work that weekend was sympathetic to her and said it was ok to quit like that because the boss never gives notice to firing anyone so why should she give notice to quitting. 

I said that it was bullshit to leave regardless of the situation because it put patients at risk and her actions punish her co-workers, not the boss (who doesn't even work weekends). And if she wanted to quit like an adult she should of waited until the end of the day then resigned formally. 

She told me I took my job too seriously and I would be singing a different tune if I ever got let go.

That pissed me off so I told her the reason I've never been let go for a job let alone written up is because I act like an adult and do what's asked of me, and if I have a problem with the way something is there are ways to change it without acting like a baby. 

Im not sure if there was more history between the quitter and the boss where this was the tipping point, and I never had any personal interactions with her so I can't speak to her prior work ethic. She's in her mid-late 30s and as far as I know never had caused trouble before. But I try to keep my nose out of other people's issues so I'm out of the loop a lot on the drama here. 

Am I the asshole for calling my coworker out on her beliefs on acceptable behavior for quitting or am I taking my job too seriously?","I appreciate your view and personally would not have quit that way because it involves the testing/health of people. 

That said, going NAH because your coworkers are right, in places with at-will employment they do let people just go with little to no notice. (Usually after they do a full day’s work.) We don’t fully know what happened that day and she is within her right to leave.",0,0,0,1,0

"AITA for asking my coworker to switch on call weekends with me?. Throwaway, on mobile.     
    
My coworker doesn’t like taking their vacation days. This ends up creating a scenario where last year they ended up with the whole month of December off and leaving a lot of work on my plate during our busy season.    
    
We both have rotating weekends on call so we can have two days off with our work phones off completely.    
    
This year they finally booked their PTO off to have long weekends on the weekend they are on call.   This means they will no longer be on call during their PTO enabled long weekend for the remainder of the year.    
    
I thought it would be fair if we swap our on call weekends, otherwise I would have to be on call for the next 13 weekends. They feel that isn’t fair and that it is punishing them for taking PTO if they are losing their regular disconnected weekend.    
    
We both are required to cover the floor during the week so if they would have taken every Wednesday off, there would be no need for them to be on call because I am already there.    
    
When I went on my PTO earlier this year I covered a weekend of their on call so they didn’t have to do 3 weekends in a row.

"AITA for offering to push a man in a wheelchair?. I was in an airport terminal after landing when I saw a gentleman in a wheelchair, his lap laden with bags.  We were at the base of a pretty decent incline about 100 yards long(the incline allows aircraft to taxi under it).  He seemed to be alone and a little tired from the lengthy trip to this point.  I noticed a slight hesitation, started to walk over, and asked “Would you like a push?”

His response was a curt “No thank you”.

After his response I noticed the push bars I normally see on wheelchairs were not on his wheelchair.

"WIBTA if I just keep to myself and say nothing unless approached in an upcoming school gathering?. In high school, I was involved in a very immature fight with another girl. I'm not sure if it counts as ""bullying"" per se, but I would call some girl really mean names and would make fun of her appearance. In my defence, she also did the same thing back to me. I think we just didn't like each other and we both handled it very badly, being very hormonal high school girls.

I've now matured since then and have realised that participating in this ""immature fight"" was such a stupid thing to do. During this ""immature fight"" I fat-shamed this girl and now feel severely remorseful over this (although in my defence she did also shame me for being ugly and having a flat chest). In the past years I badly wanted to apologise to this girl for some of the things I said during this ""immature fight""; however I never got the chance to as she moved away from our hometown for university and I don't have her contact number.

Recently, I discovered that we both signed up to participate in our high school's upcoming school reunion gathering. My moral conscience badly wants to apologise to her during this gathering as I know I said some very hurtful things in the past and I really want to make it up to her if possible. However, after some internal reflection, I realised that apologising might not be the best thing to do as it brings up bad memories in what would otherwise be a very happy event. I also realised that she might not want the apology and blurting out one many years after the fact might be more harmful than helpful.

My close friends from high school think I should just keep to myself during the gathering, and only apologise if she approaches me first (or does anything to signal that she still remembers what happened and would appreciate an apology). However, I can't help but feel like an asshole if I don't apologise, especially since I did do something wrong and morally-speaking you're supposed to apologise after making mistakes.

"AITA for being in a spin room right before a spin class starts. So a little context. In an attempt to not ruin my knees by 30 I’ve started to cycle more instead of running every day and at my gym the traditional stationary bikes in the cardio area are pretty shit and the spin bikes are in much better condition so I use those. 

Typically, I will try to get on the bike around 8 AM so I have a solid 45 minutes to get my cycle in before the class that’s in the room starts at 9 AM. Thus far I’ve had no problems.

Today, however, I slept in a little longer than usual so by the time I got on the bike it was around 8:15 and you can probably see where this is going. 

Now on weekends when I know the classes are going to be full I try to avoid the spin room but on Tuesdays and Thursdays the classes have maybe 6 people, and the room has enough bikes for close to 50 so I figure I won’t get in anyone’s way even if someone comes early to claim their bike. 

So this morning my ride was cutting close to the start time and the instructor and few people in the class were all filtering in and glaring at me as I finished up my ride. By the time I was done it was 8:59 and I felt like I had just murdered someone the way everyone was looking at me. 

Also probably relevant is that my gyms equipment policy is that guests not paying for personal training can use all the equipment in the facility, but understand that the trainers and clients take priority.

"WIBTA for waiting to tell a girl her boyfriend is cheating on her with me?. I've (20F) been seeing this guy (21M) and we haven't had sex yet but basically have done everything else. We are more like friend with benefits. We met unintentionally as a music concert our college put on and hit it off immediately.  I recently found out today that he does in fact have a girlfriend. I don't have an instagram just for personal reasons however my other female friend does. I told her his name because I was telling her about him and she wanted to see what he looked like. As she was scrolling she found a picture posted a while ago of him and another girl on what seemed like a Christmas vacation in a city close to us (location tagged).

&#x200B;

I assumed they were a couple just from the dynamic of the picture but I didn't want to jump to conclusions as that was the last photo of them together on his instagram account and they might have broken up. So I asked my friend to message the girl to see if that was her boyfriend. As to not raise suspicion the message went something like ""you guys are such a cute couple, I've always wanted to go to \*city\*!"" just a simple message. The girl replied a few hours later saying thank you how kind and asked if she knew us since I understood she was probably confused of a stranger messaging her.

&#x200B;

So since she didn't deny it I'm assuming they're a couple now. The problem is next week is finals week and my friend said to wait until after to tell her because she'll be heartbroken and emotionally not ready to study and take her tests. I agreed but the guilt has been eating me up and I can't help but feel if I was on the other end I'd want someone to tell me immediately.

"WIBTA If I asked out a girl whose sister I asked out recently?. So I'm straight male. I took an interest in a girl (I'll call her Sarah) about 6 months ago. She was really an amazing person, and pretty too. I wrote her a love poem asking her out. She said no, and I (in my humble opinion) took it like a champ. We are really great friends and I can even drop a joke here or there about the rejection with no awkwardness or anything.

Now that I'm friends with her however, I met her sister and WOW, she is (in my personal opinion) better than Sarah in every way (not to say Sarah isn't great). I am super crushing hard on her right now, and want to ask her out. Really, she is the girl of my dreams.

"WIBTA If I stay with my girlfriend after she threw up on my ex girlfriend and other friends?. I haven't been with my new girlfriend for very long, less than one month, so this is definitely a factor that I need to take into consideration. 

&#x200B;

It was my best friend's, Tom, birthday party a few days ago, so I decided to take my GF Jess to meet all of my friends, and she was down too. We were having a good time, she was getting along well with everyone until I noticed that Jess had been drinking constantly throughout the night and was getting drunker and drunker by the second. 

&#x200B;

Not really wanting to expose her in such a state to my friends, I decided I'd take her home, but she managed to slip away and I couldn't find her for a while before Tom found me and said Jess was throwing up in the bathroom. 

&#x200B;

I was so embarrassed seeing my drunk girlfriend emptying her guts in the toilet, while my ex-girlfriend, Mandy was holding her hair back, both covered in vomit, while Tom, another few friends were also covered in her vomit. When Jess was better, I dropped her at her older sister's place (her parents would kill her if she came home drunk) and went home. 

&#x200B;

Upon awkwardly asking my friends what they thought of Jess, they said they didn't care if I stayed with her, but they didn't want to be around her in situations with alcohol. However, they believe I've ""downgraded"" considering my new girlfriend ruined the night for a bunch of people while she was drunk, while my old girlfriend held her hair back as she practically threw up all over her. 

&#x200B;

I get that what happened with Jess was embarrassing, but she apologized to me and said that she was nervous to meet them so she thought alcohol would help, but obviously went too far, and promised it wouldn't happen again. Still, after what my friends said, I'm thinking that staying with her in spite of that might be a dick move. So, WIBTA?

"AITA for getting annoyed with an overly-affectionate couple at a restaurant?. This has actually happened twice in the last month, and I'm discovering that this is becoming a pet peeve of mine.

Last night I went to dinner with my wife and my 12 year old son, and we were sitting at a hi-top table next to the bar.  There was a couple at the bar, probably about my age (mid-40's), and after a few minutes, I noticed they couldn't keep their hands off each other.  They weren't making out or anything like that, but just constant stroking, petting, and nuzzling (no feeling-up or crotch rubbing from what I could tell).  I found myself feeling oddly distracted and uncomfortable. Initially it was funny, but the longer we were at the restaurant, irritation and annoyance started to set in, and I wanted to get the hell out of there as fast as possible.

I don't have a particular aversion to PDA, and my wife and are affectionate to each other (not nearly to that extent), but I tried to explore reasons in my mind why it began to bother me so much.  It's not like I was envious of how I perceived their relationship, because I'm just not wired that way.  I think the only thing I could come up with is that we were in somewhat close proximity to them, and it felt like their overt intimacy in a public setting was invading my personal space.  Like if I was on a plane, and the couple next to me started going at it, I'd feel like I need to be further away to give them privacy. 

Just to note, I didn't say a word about it, much less ask them to stop.  I mentioned it to my wife on the way home and she thought it was funny that it bothered me.  It just made me wonder why this random couple getting so touchy in public struck a nerve with me.  Am I the asshole?","NAH

"AITA for not being as worried about things as my husband?. We bought a house over a year ago. I had rose colored glasses since it was our first house. It's a little older, built in the 70s, but most of it was renovated, mainly the kitchen.  Since we moved in, there have been a few issues such as cracked grout in the bathroom and kitchen floors.

The main issue is our new bathroom. When we bought the house we knew there was some bad water damage under the main bathroom. But it was old and dry and the inspector told us not to worry about it. We lucked out and the shower started to leak and cause more damage and we were able to get the bathroom completely renovated, covered by insurance.  It's all tiled, including the shower.

He's still very paranoid about more water damage. I keep trying to tell him he shouldn't worry so much but he gets upset if I do anything that gets a bit of water on the floor. I don't throw water everywhere but I don't always completely towel off before I get out and I brush my short hair while it's still wet in front of the sink.

"AITA for being mad at friend because she ""lied""?. This happened last friday.

My \[18M\] friend \[18F\] and I were just casually walking around the city and drinking. Usual friday stuff. We started at around 7 PM and when clock hit 11 PM she told me that she is feeling really sleepy and wants to go home. Thats understandable. 

&#x200B;

At this point both of us are drunk and we can't drive. So, she is texting her friend (Some kind of ex) and asks him to pick her up to go home. We part our ways and after 30mins I get a snapchat. She is driving around the city and drinking with other guys when she obviously told me that she wants to go home.

&#x200B;

I asked her today about this situation and she told me that she was feeling sleepy and was going home but that guy persuaded her to stay and drink with him. It wasn't her plan to continue partying but she did it anyway.

"AITA for refusing to accept a half-assed apology?. Last year I was on a sports team (I live in a liberal area where our sports teams are allegedly open-minded) with Toby, a guy who said mildly homophobic things and treated me more coldly than he treated our teammates after I came out as gay.

Toby was popular on the team because he was a big partier and successful with the ladies. He was also insecure about his body (coach told him to ask me how I got buff) and his position on the team (we're both not amazing, but I'm better than he is). As a result, my teammates were willing to overlook his casual comments like when he said he was uncomfortable doing tackling drills with me and when he said, ""in my experience, when two guys kiss, they're just confused.""

I thought my problems were gone when Toby said he was transferring schools, but it turns out that the transfer was just for a semester and he'll be back in January. I told the captain, ""Just so you know, if Toby returns to the team, I will be quitting."" My captain was very understanding. He knows that I am the better player and recognized some problems Toby brought to team culture. 

Our captain contacted Toby and brought up our problems from last year and apparently Toby felt bad and wanted to apologize.

I received a note. Here are the main points, ""I'm sorry about the whole situation. There were a lot of misunderstandings. We have both become better people over the past few months. My teammates are like my brothers. Sorry if you didn't feel that way. Let's talk more when I'm back.""  


I don't want to accept this apology. I don't feel that it's genuine and I think that it is suggesting that I was part of the problem or that it was all a misunderstanding. At the same time, I know it's kinda dick-ish not to accept an apology. What do you all think? AITA?","I think nothing yet.

"AITA for asking a stranger to give up his table to me at a cafe?. First real post ever because this has been eating at me all day. 

For some context, this is lunch rush hour in the CBD (central business district), about 1 PM. It was a casual dining type of cafe that had smashing sandwiches (really just out of this world), so the crowd would get pretty intense. 

There’s usually an equal number of people dining in and packing to go, but as I was having lunch with a friend to catch up we needed a table. 

Obviously, they’re all taken so we stand about waiting (it’s socially acceptable where I’m from, idk about the US). A table of two guys is done with their food (empty plates, no drink) and they’re chatting pretty intensely. 

I think they’re about to be done as there’s no more food so I wait 5 minutes. Then 10. It doesn’t look like they’re about to leave despite the obvious crowd forming waiting for tables. 

So I approach them and ask ‘So sorry, excuse me, are you going to be leaving soon?’

One of the guys apologises profusely and gets up to leave, but the other gives the dirtiest disgusted look, glowers and huffs off with his friend. Ok now I feel bad. I guess he was a paying customer and had a right to use the table as he wished. There were no restaurant rules governing this. 

AITA? You can be honest :(

You waited for them to leave and then you asked, and you asked politely.

 The guy that apologized knew that he wasn't being nice by holding the table even if there is no rules.

"AITA for not talking to, or have had any contact with, my Sister in ten years?. Context from 2010: In my (26m at the time) book some things can never be forgiven. It  started with her (23f at the time) stealing my father's pain medication while he was on his literal deathbed in hospice dying of cancer. As in, she tried to pick the lock to get to the morphine pump he was on, while mom and I stepped out for a bite to eat. We were taking shifts, and she had already ate before showing up high. No  charges were pressed, but she wasn't allowed back onto the premises. I  ended up taking care of him and my mother by myself for the two weeks he was there. She knew I was not happy with what she had done, and I didn't really talk to her except as necessary until Thanksgiving 2010.

Thanksgiving 2010 is when it all went down. Dinner was at my mother's place, my sister still lived with her at the time, and it was going to be me, my boyfriend, and most of my mother's family. My sister started talking shit about me to the rest of the  family saying how I never help her, that I won't lift a finger to help mom (not true and mom backed me on that), and the outed me as gay as we sat down to eat dinner to the rest of the family who didn't know. She even tried to drag my boyfriend into it which he wasn't happy about. She continued on, even though everyone was trying to get her to calm down. I got pissed, and that's when it came to a head. I let the family know what she did at the hospice, and how she was banned from there as our father passed away.

She threw a tantrum, seeing as everyone wasn't going against me like she wanted and started saying she just wanted to die and that she needed help and that she would call 911 to go to the  mental hospital. The last thing I said to her was, ""just get out of my life."" I left the dinner and never looked back. (Her running to the mental hospital is something she always did for  attention. Get a 48-hour admit and not have to face her problems she  caused.)

Recently, she's been reaching out to family, trying to get my number.  Wants to make amends and has been ""sober for five years."" I don't want  anything to do with her. My life has been peaceful since I cut her out.  And while some members of my family are giving her another chance for  the 895th time, a lot aren't either. They do think I should at least  talk to her.

So, am I the asshole for not wanting her back in my life in anyway, shape, or form?","NAH

Let me be clear - I'm only saying she's not the asshole for trying to get in touch not for all the other shit she did.

I've dealt with addicts for a long time. My uncles are both serious alcoholics (now sober, thankfully), my mom was also a huge drug addict and has been clean for 10 years, and I have various extended family and my bf's family, all huge huge drug and alcohol problems. The stories I could tell...

Well one thing I've learned is that ""the addict"" is one part of them that is like a feral animal. It's not their true self. They will say and do all sorts of things to get a fix. Those that participate in AA or NA and follow the steps have to face their mistakes and try to make ammends, so it sounds like that's what she's doing, if she's sober. So I think she's just following the steps of sobriety. Good for her. It's really great when an addict can get help and get sober, both for themselves and also to stop hurting those around them.

That said, you are never under any obligation to keep anybody in your life you don't want to, even if they've ""gotten better"" or turned over a new leaf or whatever. You are not obligated 5o forgive them at all. The damage is done, so to speak. And her dealing with that closed door from you is part of what she has to deal with in terms of consequences of her addiction.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for not stopping to help this woman who asked for ""help"" last night?. I had a weird encounter last night and I just wanted to get some thoughts on how we acted. I \[23 F\] was walking home with my friend \[26 M\] around midnight last night, and as we were nearing my place there was this woman (probably in her 20s?) standing outside this condo building and holding her phone. She called out to us and asked us if we could just stand with her as she booked a hotel for the night on her phone. We were kind of weirded out by the question, so we asked her what she meant. I was getting weird/sketchy vibes from her, I'm not sure exactly why but I just felt uneasy. She said she just didn't feel safe being alone and she had nowhere to go, so could we just stand with her while she booked it?    


Now, we were in a downtown area, surrounded by lots of buildings and lights and there were a decent amount of people outside even though it was late. So I asked her why she didn't just go inside the lobby of the building she was standing outside of. There was literally a security guard and a concierge there so surely she would feel safe? And if not there were several neighbouring buildings and coffee shops etc. She said that she had just gotten into a fight with someone who lives in that building and people kept coming up to her and she feels unsafe and pleaded with us to stand with her. I still felt weird, I didn't get why she was just standing in front of the building she had just gotten into a fight with someone in then? She could literally have walked anywhere else... My friend still seemed a bit weirded out, but more like he was okay with standing there, but I didn't, so I apologized to her and said we had to go, and restated suggestions of where she could walk to feel safer, and we left. We both didn't really know how to feel about the situation, and agreed that it was weird, but now I'm wondering if I was paranoid for no reason and if we should have tried to help her more?",NTA  When you get weird vibes you should trust them and protect your self.,0,0,0,1,0

"AITA for wanting to spend more time with my boyfriend?. Throwaway because my boyfriend is on this sub a lot.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years so far. The first six months was when we were in college and we saw each other every day. Then after we graduated, we began seeing each other less and less. 

It went from 7 days a week to 3 days a week to only seeing each other on the weekends. I was frustrated about this and wanted to spend more time together, but my boyfriend lives with his parents so we only hang at my place, which is an hour subway ride or 20 minute drive away from him (he only uses the subway though).

Recently, we’ve made plans to hang out during the weekend, but urgent work stuff came up and he cancelled, forcing me to wait two weeks before he’d come over. Then he did it again this week, saying he has grad school apps due soon. So we won’t hang out until after Thanksgiving. This month we will have hung out 7 out of 30 days, if he comes over after Thanksgiving.

For context, we’ve been going out for two years but I’ve never been invited over to his parents place, and we don’t spend major holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas) together. I even rented a studio apartment because he felt shy and uncomfortable in front of my roommates, and I thought having our own place (which I pay for 100%) would make him more willing to come over. 

To be fair, we spend most weekends together. I just want to spend time during the week as well, and want him to not cancel whenever he wants. Even when we make plans he comes an hour or two late to my place, which is not a lot but still frustrating. He wants to spend time with his old-age parents, which I can understand, but his absence makes me really lonely, especially in the winter time.

Is it too much to ask that we spend the weekends together and he doesn’t cancel our plans or shorten them at will? I feel so powerless in this situation because it’s always up to him to decide when we hang out. I want to spend every day together but I feel like that’s a dream that will never come true now. Meanwhile my other friends see their SO’s every day and it makes me really sad that my boyfriend doesn’t want to see me. I’m not sure if this is worth making a fuss over, or if I should suck it up and deal with it.

Edit: I just want to be clear, my boyfriend didn’t force me to move out of my place with roommates. The lease was up and we all parted ways. But he agreed that having a studio would make it easier for him to come over, because we wouldn’t have to share one bathroom and kitchen among four roommates and him  anymore.","INFO - is there a reason you’ve never been invited to his parents place?

Had a kid, put my career on the back burner to care for our kid so he could work and move up the ladder. Now I’m back in the workforce and he’s in “busy season” since he works for a big 4 accounting firm but I feel like I’m sacrificing in my new job because I’m the last to arrive and first to leave everyday since my husband works so much and my babysitter can only be around during very specific work hours even though my job is not that demanding but all they ask is that I work 9-6 and my babysitters needs have been requiring me to leave early everyday. I also care for everything around the house and do 98% of the child care when I’m not at work. I also make more money than my husband and pay for pretty much all child related things and things around the house besides big purchases like TVs and AC units which he covers.

"AITA for having my friend help me put sunscreen on?. So yesterday I \[19F\] went to the beach with my boyfriend \[20M\] and a group of our friends. We all meet at the beach around lunch time. My boyfriend leaves with a couple of our friends to go get some food, because we're planning on eating some lunch and hang out for a bit and then going for a swim.

I knew I wanted to get sunscreen on now while I was under some shade and we were eating, to let it soak in before we went for our swim. I put it on my arms and legs and face and everything, but I was wearing a bikini and couldn't reach my back, so I decided to ask a friend \[20F\] who had stayed behind to help put some on my back. She agrees which I'm super thankful for, because I burn easily, and wanted to get as much sun protection as possible, so didn't want to wait for my boyfriend to get back because it wouldn't have had as much time to soak in. I didn't see any issue in having my friend help me out.

Now, I do want to note that I am openly bisexual and the friend I had asked is also openly bisexual, and is one of my good friends but my boyfriend doesn't know her as well. Her and I have only ever been friends though and have had no sexual history or anything together, we are purely platonic friends! But the fact that we are both bisexual is what this story hinges on.

So she helps me out and rubs it on the parts of my back that I can't reach. Now, my swim suit has a bunch of straps that criss cross all over it and on my upper back as well, and she had asked me if I wanted her to put sunscreen under the straps as well in case they moved while I was in the water. I agreed that that was a good idea so she reach her hand into the back of my swim suit and kept rubbing it on the centre and sides of my back to make sure everything was covered. We were also joking around and at one point she hugged me and jokingly kissed me on the cheek.

At this point my boyfriend gets back with our other friends and the food, and I can immediately see that he's angry at me. He pulls me aside and said he was upset that we had been ""flirting"" like that. He said that as he was walking back he could see her ""feeling me up"" and that because I was bisexual and I wanted her touching me, and that she didn't have to be reaching in to my swim suit to ""grope"" me like that. I told him he was completely wrong and nothing inappropriate had happened. He asked me how I would have felt if I had come back and seen an ""attractive woman"" rubbing sunscreen into his back, and I said that if it was one of our friends then that wouldn't bother me, but he told me I was lying. I told him that just because I was bisexual didn't mean that I want to jump everyone in sight, and that I'm capable of having platonic friends, even if they happen to be bisexual as well.

"AITA for being upset with my fiancé for not answering my calls for over two hours?. So this definitely needs context. I’m not one to get upset with my fiancé for not texting back quickly or returning a call immediately, because we’ve been together for 7 years, we have a kid, and things are normally pretty great with us. We’re 22 and he’s always let me know what he’s doing, where he’s going, if he’s going to be late, etc. even when we were in high school. I can’t recall a time before this where he didn’t answer me or let me know what was going on. We both go out on our own and do this for each other, and it’s always been an unspoken rule between us to let the other know. And if our phones are dead, we call from a friend’s or even the store’s/bar’s/whatever else’s phone. We’ve both experienced a lot of loss, so it’s understandable to both of us that it’s important to know where the other is at and if they’re okay. 

Today, he had a friend over to look at his friend’s broken down truck (towed it to our house). He then had to take said friend home, which should have been about a 20 minute trip. 

Anyway, after about 30 minutes I called him to pick up milk and toilet paper on his way back. No answer. I texted him to let him know. 

After an hour, he still hadn’t answered me or read the text. He usually calls back if he misses my call, and he usually lets me know if he’s staying later at someone’s house than he first intended to. That’s never been a big deal to me because he *always lets me know*. 

After about 1 1/2 hours, he still wasn’t answering me. I started to get genuinely concerned. I was nervous he got in an accident because it isn’t at all like him to not answer or at least let me know what is going on. We live in northern Michigan and the likelihood of an accident is pretty high in March. So I called him about 3 more times. Now would also be a good time to mention that we recently had a very close friend die, due to road conditions and no seatbelt (and my guy ALWAYS forgets his seatbelt). 

I started worrying something bad had actually happened, so I called his friend who he was taking home. His friend also didn’t answer (which is also weird). I called my guy again a couple of times, with no answer. I left voicemails and texted him to call me.. and eventually I told him to just answer his fucking phone because I was worried. 

It turns out, nothing bad happened. They both just didn’t pay attention to their phones and lost track of time. But when he got back home, he told me I was freaking out over nothing and for no reason (which, technically, it *was nothing* and I had no reason to freak out). But I explained to him I panicked, because of our friend recently losing his life, and that it was unlike him to not answer me. He’s insisting that I’m overreacting, and that I should just trust him. I told him it isn’t that I didn’t trust him to be where he said- because that honestly didn’t even cross my mind. I was just worried because a 20 minute trip turned into over 2 hours and I had no idea what was happening.

"AITA for ignoring my friend after they ignored me asking for help?. TW: Mental health

This was a person I immediately got along with, but our friendship was always casual and light-hearted. Basically, we went to the same school but started talking more frequently when we got put in the same groupchat. It was a really fun group, I have fond memories of it, but it eventually died out. Anyways, that was a few years ago, since then I kept talking to this person 1-on-1 online, as we both switched schools. By this time, I think it's safe to assume we were semi-close. We didn't talk evvveryday, but it was frequent, and I knew lots of personal stuff about him. I knew he had a rough past, financially and emotionally. I knew he had mental disorders and took multiple medications for it. That's fine, he's a great person, and we all have our demons. I was always there if he needed anything, checked on him from time to time, heard him out, and supported him but was honest told him when i thought maybe he was a lil out of line. (Like if he fought with someone and I thought he was partially in the wrong.)

But here's the thing,

I've also been dealing with my own problems, since before I met him, and recently he messaged me and asked how I was doing. More or less, I say. Why? he responds. I then proceed to awkwardly word out that oh no i mean- im basically doing pretty well, like most days are decent days, just I've had a few impulsively bad ☠ days inbetween.

and nothing. he doesn't say anything.

I felt so bad, I shouldn't have said anything, but I thought we had created a space of trust for these kinds of things. It's ok if he doesn't feel comfortable talking about it or whatever, but why? What's wrong?

Now he's back to messaging me things about himself and his life and selfies of his makeup but. I feel weird responding. This is also right after he had issues with his irl friends who've decided he's ""too self- centered and annoying"" to hang out with, or something like that, that's their opinion of him anyways.

"AITA for pushing back against the wishes of my gravely ill ex-wife in regards to our child?. My ex-wife has had a very aggressive form of leukemia since August of 2017. She’s been in the hospital most of that time except for two periods after a bone marrow transplant. Over this time, she has had periods where she has been on a ventilator, she’s been unable to respond to texts, and sometimes her and her family refuse to give me basic information about her condition. The outcome and survival for this form of the disease is below 1%.

Edit for clarity; My ex-wife hasn’t been home since December. There isn’t anyone to live with. My ex-wife’s mother is staying with my daughter as much as possible. If she were home, this wouldn’t be a thing at all. 

We share a 12 year old daughter. My wife and daughter live 4 hours away. Since she has been in the hospital which is about halfway between our two cities, my daughter has been living at my ex-wife’s home being cared for by my ex-wife’s mother. However, the grandmother drives back and forth to the hospital most days.

During breaks in school, some weekends, summer, and holidays I have my daughter. The only reason my daughter is there is because of her enrollment in school and her friends. One 7 different occasions, I’ve tried to form a plan for when we should consider moving our daughter to live with me.

I have been unable to even get a conversation going or a plan of when “enough would be enough”. My ex-wife in a stable period, but was about to be very sick about 6 weeks ago and I pushed so hard everyone in the family basically unfriended me on social media, stopped giving me information, and told me “I was upsetting everybody.” 

Look, I’d love nothing more than the mother of my daughter to get up and go home to live a long life with our daughter... but she’s mine to protect. (Not the grandparents or a feral kid to raider herself) I have the right to raise her and protect her.

Before anyone asks. I’m not a deadbeat. I have a great job, own my house, no arrests, no drugs or other issues. My daughter and I are extremely close. The issue is they’ve been afraid to 1) accept the high chance my ex-wife is going to die. AND 2) It’s not good for anyone involved to continue to drive 2 hours a day each way while trying to take care of a tween.

My daughter fwiw is getting good grades, no behavioral issues, but she def carries a burden and maturity beyond her age because of this. She’s a brilliant kid. My entire reason for bringing her to live with me is to make sure she is getting the chance to be a kid while she still can AND because she has a family here. AITA for thinking it’s odd she’s alone up there and nobody is seeing an issue.

Lastly. Lawyer has told me because of the complexity, it would be a little drawn out of a fight. Her advice was to just not return her next time she visits. That seems like a course that might make things worse and harm the relationship with my daughter.

TL:DR - ex is very sick. Hasn’t been out of a hospital for 4+ months. Daughter is doing well in school. She doesn’t want to move her. I’m trying to form a plan moving forward. Nobody wants to upset her. Now they’ve cut me off information wise. Wouldn’t be resolved legally before end of school year. AITA for bringing it up every time I talk to my dying ex-wife even though it upsets her?","NAH. This is hard to judge, but ultimately I don't think anyone is being an asshole here (besides not giving you any info, that is not fair). I can see your ex-wife and family wanting to keep some stability through all this for your daughter by letting her still have her friends and school and such. I also understand that moving her permanently to you might be difficult for them because it might mean they have to face in a more real way the very real risk of your ex-wife passing. But I also 100% understand why you want your daughter to come live with you, you are her dad after all and will most likely, sadly, be her only parent soon. And if your daughter is alone a lot and has to take on extra responsibilities, then that is of course another important reason. 

I don't know where you live, but wouldn't the school year be over soon anyways? For your daughter it might be best to get to finish the school year in her current school and with her friends, and to start in a new school (where you live) next school year. That way you can also give the family of your ex-wife some time to mentally prepare for it.

Also, what does your daughter say about all of this? She is old enough to have an opinion and say in what she wants. Possible she might feel guilty about ""leaving"" her mom, and therefore feel she should stay, but have you talked to her about it?",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA if I clean my daughter's (25F) tiny apartment instead of buying her a birthday gift?. Long story short, my daughter for some reason seems incapable of keeping the tiniest space clean. I was hoping that having a kid would improve the situation, but now my granddaughter is almost 2, and its gotten worse now, since she no longer has roommates chirping at her. Family services has even gotten involved, and because their so called standard is so low, it's not having much effect. On one hand, their involvement is forcing her to get help for her mental illness, but at the same time, the environment is still hazardous to the baby's health and safety. Her birthday is in 2 days, and since I'm going to spend the final week of her (27f) sister's (really rough) pregnancy in their town, helping her with her other 2 kids, I've offered to clean the apartment.

I was emotionally abusive to all my past ex's. I knew what I was doing wrong and I always mades accusations and fights anyways. Drove me crazy watching myself hurt the ones I loved. Like a living hell for me.

"AITA for trying to get my husband out of the house?. I’m sorry I’m on mobile. 

My husband is in the US military. He’s gone for work for about 10 hours a day. When he gets home, he showers and play video games until ~ 5am. His job is really hard and I’m aware of his sacrifices. 

When we first got to our base, he was super excited to  explore and hang out with me. Now, it just feels like I’m annoying him anytime I want to hang out outside of video games. He never wants to watch more than one movie with me because he gets bored sitting there not doing anything, but turns around and plays video games for 5 hours straight only stopping for bathroom and quick food/drink breaks. 

I understand that he’s upset about his job, his coworker recently told me he’s been upset about something for the past couple weeks (not something I did). I didn’t know the thing affected him that much, I thought he was over it already since he hasn’t said anything to me.  He has spoken to his doctor and brought up depression a couple times and I think video games is his way of coping with it. He plays everyday after work and on weekends. 

My problem is being cooped up in the house makes me feel awful, I don’t want to call it depression since I haven’t spoken to a doctor. I’ll just lay on the couch in a blanket burrito and watch videos/movies all day until it’s time to go to sleep. I try to adventure on my own and I have a couple times, but I want my husband there with me like he used to be. 

He’ll agree to go out sometimes if I plan everything out, but I over plan and pick at all the details until I get a headache and I don’t want to keep doing it alone. There’s nothing, besides food, that he’s interested in doing outside the house anymore. 

I took off the summer from work to spend time with him since his favorite things to do are “spend time with me and play video games” but we’re not doing a lot of the former. I try to play video games with him, but I’m really bad and don’t like losing so it’s not a ton of fun for me plus him and his friends all want to play other games that they’re all skilled in from years of practice. He played when we were dating, but still made time to take me out and just hang out. 

I know it makes him happy and I shouldn’t rely on him, but nothing I do makes me happy anymore. I’m trying to find hobbies and switch to a job where we’ll be working during the hours, but no luck yet. He’s still generally a great guy, I just feel neglected but I know it’s helping distract him from all the stressful parts of life and I don’t want to add on to the stress.

"WIBTA if I ask my parents to save for retirement?. This might be the wrong place for this.

&#x200B;

First post on Reddit here we go. I apologize in advance for any grammatical or spelling mistake in here, there's bound to be a few of them.

&#x200B;

So let's get this started. I'm 19 and I am an only child, my parents are both 47-48ish and to my knowledge they have almost nothing saved for retirement. I know for a fact my mother put less than $400 away in the 2018 tax year, my father almost certainly put away nothing. Our family is not wealthy, my father's mother has a fair bit of cash but any inheritance would be split between at least 4 brothers and likely other family members as well. I almost feel I have to have children (I'm the only reproduction age male with the family name) all of my uncles either didn't have children or had girls, my dad definitely wants grandchildren. Taking care of kids is going to hard enough but having to care of my parents as well sounds like a recipe for disaster. I should also mention that they do make enough to save a decent amount for retirement, they're aren't bringing in big bucks, but I've personally seen people do a lot more with a lot less. Right now I make very little $16K/year after tax (I save almost everything I make) and I'm about to put myself though college, when I'm done with that I'll, hopefully, be making A LOT more than what I am now. 

&#x200B;

Bottom line is that I'm scared what my life will be like when they retire in 20 or so years when they have pretty much nothing saved now, even if their income goes up massively they're still far behind where they realistically could be. 

&#x200B;

I want to talk to them about it, but I really don't want them to feel like I'm demanding them to start saving, this isn't like that. I also know it's hard for fathers to take advice from someone who's ass they wiped. I very well could be the asshole here, and it may sound a bit selfish but I just don't think I'll be able to support them in there later years if they don't have at least a little saved. They're my parents I can't have them living on the street.

"AITA for not wanting to work out at the same gym as my girlfriend because I think it's sexist?. My girlfriend and I both enjoy working out, and have gone to different gyms since before we met. Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large ""**women only**"" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.

I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that ""*I just don't understand*"", and that ""*it's different for women*"".

Am I being the asshole here and just not understanding?

&#x200B;

Edits for more info as requested:

\- The gyms are roughly the same size, but hers is slightly more expensive.

\- There is similar equipment in both the unisex and womens sections, but frequently lineups and wait times to use cardio equipment (treadmills and bikes) in the unisex area that are unused in the womens section.

\- I have no issue with these private sections existing, my thoughts are that pricing should reflect the access.

\- The majority of the women there seem to use the unisex area for the majority of their workouts.

\- When we are both there we would be working out together in the unisex area, other than when cardio machines are busy and she said she would use the ones in the womens section. We also work out alone when schedules conflict.","NAH, but come on dude you’re just looking to be offended by this.

"AITA for not really caring about my baby sister?. Sorry for the clickbaitey title but I'm not sure how else to phrase this. I care about her as in I care about her wellbeing, but not really her day to day happenings. I guess I care about her more as though she's some random child and not a blood relative.

Anyways, she's 3 years old and was born to my mom and her husband. I'm 19 and living with a close family friend just down the street. I live here and not with my mom because there's suddenly a lot of people living with my mom (her bf and his 2 kids, my sister, and two other relatives) and having grown up an only child in a household with just my mom and dad I couldn't stand all the chaos and noise. I mention this because I want to stress that I don't not care for her because I dislike my mom's bf. I don't like him, but I wouldn't take that out on a child. It's not her fault that her dad and I don't get along.

However, the family friend I'm living with loooooves my sister. Whenever I get home from work she always wants to give my a play by play of what my little sister had done and I guess she expects me to dote over her as well, being as she's my sister, but I just... don't really care? I'm glad she's well and she seems to be a pretty smart kid and all but I just don't really give a shit about that cute thing she said, or how much she loves this cartoon. 

For the record, I've never said that I don't care about my sister, but I get the feeling that the family friend knows and is trying to push us to be closer. I guess the best word I could use to describe how I feel about her is ""Indifferent."" I feel about her as I would feel about someone I see on the street. I'm glad their alive, and if they look unhappy I would be sad for them, but I don't really want to know about their lives.

"AITA for intentionally ruining my BF's proposal?. BF and I were at my father's wedding reception, and my entire family and dad's friends were there. BF been dropping hints all day about a surprise he had planned and he kept putting his hand in his trouser pocket, but when his hand was out of his pocket I saw something that could have very easily been a ring box.

"AITA for telling my wife to stop helping her family?. **Background**
We’ve been married for 6 years. She has one young brother, about 12 years old now, and two parents (still married and living together).

Her dad used to own a construction company that was pretty successful. They drove all German luxury cars, had a nice house, vacationed multiple times a year.

He lost his business in 2008 and fell into a serious funk. He’s definitely been very depressed. 

For the last 6 years, he’s wandered from odd job to odd job, doing professional work for buddies or family or other handyman stuff. Sometimes work is so hard to come by that his elderly mom will hire him to do stuff she really doesn’t need done.

My wife’s mom, on the other hand, works 80+ hours a week. She has two jobs, and this month has been working until midnight almost every night. 

This has been pretty par for the course since we’ve been married, my MIL working her butt off while my FIL refuses to get a steady job. I’ve actually gotten him a job offer with one of my clients, to work 40 hours a week M-F, and he said it wasn’t for him.

In the meantime, they’re always struggling financially, their house has termites, leaks, the deck is rotten, their cars constantly breaking down.

**what my wife does**
Since before our marriage, my wife has been the fill-in parent. Always driving 40 miles round trip to pick up from school, friends houses, etc. On every school break, she becomes the tour guide, taking her sibling to the Zoo, museums, road trips, all of that.

This advent season, I haven’t seen my wife for more than a handful of days because she babysits so late that she sleeps over, because she works early mornings. Reason being my FIL is out of town on another odd job.

Even today, Christmas Eve, she is running on 4 hours of sleep, but won’t come home to nap because she needs to prepare for the in-law dinner as her mom is at work today.

It’s been this way, to varying degrees, for years.

**Why I’m fed up**
The parent sob story lost its effect on my a long time ago. Unemployment is almost non existent where I live, especially in contracting. There’s a *ton* of construction constantly going up. 

Forget construction, because after 10+ years without regular work, it’s time to apply at Taco Bell. There’s just no excuse anymore for not bringing in any kind of reliable income. It’s not 2010 anymore, jobs are out there.

**what I’ve tried to do**
I’ve had this conversation with my wife many times. What I always get is either:

A) stop being mean to my dad 

B) they’re my family so what am I supposed to do

**bottom line**
My FIL is not a scumbag. He’s a hardworking, soft spoken guy who has been captured by depression for over a decade. But my first responsibility is to my wife, not him, and I hate seeing her taken advantage of.

**edits**

Unfortunately we are stuck between effectively abandoning a 12 year old or enabling my FIL. 

My fear is that this will only get worse as time goes on. They’re getting older and have no retirement, and this will soon become our problem when they can’t work anymore.

I do support my wife, and I’ve told her as much. I will be here no matter what.",NAH. I do have one suggestion. I would move the fuck away from a place where you have to work 80 hours. You may as well be dead.,0,0,0,1,0

"AITA For Not Going Camping?. This is long and boring but I'll try to keep it brief. 

My best friend's family has a second property by a lake, every summer she invites our group of friends up for a weekend and it's an overall a fun and relaxing experience. This will be the 3rd year she's hosting. 

This property is about a 5 hour drive away from where we live and we are expected to bring our own food/booze & camping gear since there aren't really enough beds, we sleep indoors but on air mattress/sleeping bags.

Here's where my problem arises, the last two years the group has been about 8 people total. This year the host has a new boyfriend, who along with his group of about 7 other friends are all also invited. Doubling the amount of attendees. This new boyfriend is well liked among the rest of us, but his friends are less so. 

My partner and I are both invited, but my partner is saying they aren't really interested in going because they don't want to hang out with all of the host's boyfriend's friends. They'd rather spend time with our mutual friends, since half the guests are people we don't know. 

 On top of that we went to a Halloween Party hosted by the same friend where her boyfriend's friends were all invited. They all arrived earlier than the time on the invite and by the time we arrived (7:30PM) the majority of them we're already drunk/already doing other things. My partner and I sat down and tried to socialize but no one really seemed to interested in chatting with us.

Eventually we went to the other room and started up SSB. A few of the boyfriend's friends' came over to join us but we ended up getting kicked off our own game and going back to the other room while my partner continued to feel ignored and one other person talked  with me a little bit. We left early. Later the hostess was pretty upset with us because she said we weren't trying very hard to be sociable. Particularly my partner.

It's completely in my friend's rights to invite whoever she wants to her vacation house and I'm not arguing that, but my partner and I were thinking of skipping this year because quite a few of her boyfriend's friends are going to be there this year and it's just a really long drive to spend 3 to 4 days with people who don't really seem like they want to be friends. 

On the other hand, she says that my partner especially is being a big baby and should suck it up. We only met these people on one night and they were already drinking because *we* were late, so it should be on us to give them another chance.

So, backstory first: I work in retail, so weekends off are a rare thing. My girlfriend currently works at another week-only company (Monday to Friday), so our weekends almost never cross, and we see each other rarely.

Also, my mental health hasn't been the best lately. I wouldn't say it's a depression, but I basically feel bummed out all the time, and nothing excites me anymore. I won't go into details much, but that's about it. 

So, a month or two ago, my mom proposed to offer a trip to Six Flags to help me out

*Backstory over*

This week, my boss asked me to come in Thursday (which I was supposed to have off) and have Saturday (tomorrow) off instead. I said ""Sure! I'll be able to see my GF""

I then talk to my mom about it, and she says ""Why don't you go to Six Flags with your GF?"" I hadn't planned it, but it was a great opportunity (since our weekends never match), so I said sure! Spoke to my girlfriend about it, she agreed. We're both excited

This morning, my mom asks me if it would bother me to do a raincheck on my date with my GF, and instead help my dad out working on the house (new construction, so everything outside has to be done basically). She says he's already rented the tools needed for Saturday and Sunday

I hesitated, and she took that as a no. She left to do some errands with my dad, and I've been home alone since. I have some doubts that I may have been TA, but I was really looking forward to this date. So tell me, internet strangers, AITA?

TL;DR: Finally was able to arrange a day off with my girlfriend because schedules, mom proposed we do an activity. The day before said date, mom asked me to help my dad work outside. I said no

On the other hand I go down on her before PiV sex every single time until she orgasms. We will be making out and she’ll turn on to her back to wait for me to make the first move. On top of this I give her daily back massages as she has a sore back. 

I asked her to initiate once in a while and maybe go down on me and she got defensive and says she does. She says “we talked about this like 4 times already” to which I say that there in lies the issue as it’s been discuss 4 times with no result.

She says she likes it and can’t tell me why she doesn’t do it which confuses me so much. I’d be happy to drop the subject if it was to do with a past experience or trauma but this doesn’t seem to be the case.

Am I the asshole for just wanting my girlfriend to go down on me? 



","NTA/NAH. You both clearly need to work on your communication skills. 


She said she *likes* it but she is never/very very rare willing to do it? I doubt it. Something is bothering her, it could be her lying that she likes it because she thinks she *has* to like it. Maybe there is some other problem (smell, hair, your behaviour when she is down there - too passive, too agressive, not expressive or vocal enough, etc). Maybe she thinks she is doing something wrong while doing it.

"AITA for wanting to switch teachers?. I am the parent of an elementary student. This student just recently started a new school and is really excited about it.

At their old school they had had a great time though, with the exception of one year where their teacher went into labor. Great teacher, but natural circumstances had the teacher go into labor in the middle of the school year. So, my child had to deal with substitute teachers the rest of the school year (approximately 8 months worth of learning to be exact). Didn't really give it a whole lot of thought until I realized that it wasn't the best situation to have a new substitute teacher about every month. Don't  understand the mental aspects of it, but I beleive that it didn't allow my child to get the best quality of education they can at that time. Talked to my child about it and they didn't really like having a new substitute about every month. 

So, now that we have started a new school. We were all very excited until we found out that my child would have a teacher that would be going into labor soon. Don't want to go through the same situation from the last school, so we are wanting to transfer them out. Nothing personal. Just want my child to get the best quality eductaion they can without having to worry about substitutes.
 
Let me know your thoghts please! No hard feelings.

"AITA for being upset that my boyfriend wants to travel without me?. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years. Since 2016 he's travelled overseas without me on 5 occasions. He now wants to go again in July. I can't get the time off work in July but might be able to in August. I haven't asked work yet because my boyfriend and I are arguing about this and there's no point in asking unless we can come to an agreement. 

My boyfriend is refusing to change his leave plans despite wanting me to go with him. His attitude is too bad, I'm going anyway. In his mind he's had his heart set on this particular trip on these dates and refuses to change anything. Granted there is an event he wants to go to during this time, but, this event will also happen in a much closer neighbouring country the following week. I've suggested we both go to that and just make a long weekend of it instead and then go to the overseas destination at a time that suits us both. 

At the moment he doesn't have anything booked so there's no financial detriment if he was to change his dates. He's also in a managerial position so he has more flexibility to take time off than I do. 

For further reference, my boyfriend and I usually travel together overseas annually which is why I haven't really raised much of an issue about it in the past (despite the fact it sucks getting left behind while he's on holidays). However this year it'll be the only leave he takes. He doesn't seem to care that I can't go or won't be able to take an overseas trip now.  I'm not keen to travel on my own, I've done it before and I definitely prefer travelling with him for the company. 

I have no issue with him wanting to go and ideally I would go but it's not feasible this year at that time. I understand why he wants to go when he does, but I also think it's inconsiderate to me. 

So, am I the asshole for being upset and asking that he doesn't go? 

","NAH - You have the right to be upset, and he has the right to go.

"WIBTA if i didn't let my girlfriend be named on the mortgage?. (Throwaway account)

I (25 M) and my girlfriend (25 F) have been together for around 4 years now. We have been living together renting out a place for 3 years now and everything has gone amazingly. We have a really strong relationship together and are looking at getting a mortgage. We are getting to the point in our relationship where we are thinking about taking our relationship to the next level with marriage, kids etc. 

I have a very well-paying job for my age in the UK (around £45K a year which can rise to easy £80K+). My girlfriend not so much, with salary of around £22K a year with not much progression. Whilst renting, I have always paid substantially more, but have never had a problem doing this due to the obvious gap in salary, and also, if anything ever went wrong in our relationship, I wouldn't lose out financially.

Anyway, I mentioned to my Dad how we are looking to get a mortgage together soon. He told me to not get a mortgage with her unless we both paid 50/50 down the middle. I told him this was not possible due to her salary and he told me to pay the full mortgage each month and take ""rent"" from my girlfriend to whatever she could afford. I asked why? So he explained how if she was named on the mortgage but only paid say £200 a month and i paid £800,  if we ever broke up, the mortgage would be split down the middle, leading to me losing out on a hell of a lot of money due to us being common law husband and wife after 2 years of living together.

I know in the past this happened to him with my Mother, and he has told me of friends that this has happened to. He said at the end of the day, it is my decision, but he was offering only a word of warning that he wishes I never have to experience.

I mentioned what my Dad told me to my girlfriend, and she said how she wouldn't be willing to do that, as if I was the only name on the mortgage and we split, I would keep all the money she has contributed to the mortgage. I understand where she is coming from, but I don't want to be financially stung in case our relationship ever goes sour.

TL:DR - WIBTA if i refused to share a mortgage with my girlfriend if she couldn't pay 50% unless she wasn't named on the mortgage?","Not gonna offer judgement, just tell you that your dad is wrong.  In the UK, you can own property as ""tenants in common"" with a partner, where you specify % ownership.  So if she will contribute say 35% of the mortgage, then she can have 35% ownership.  You can also adjust it in the future if your circumstances change and she is paying more.

I accepted an unpaid internship in August for a small production house mostly because I knew it would get me to the city I wanted to live in.

"WIBTA for telling my sister about her husband's creepy AF novel about me?. Hi. Made a new throwaway account to post this because I am... wildly conflicted right now.

**Backstory:** My sister (4 years younger than me) and her husband have been married \~2yr, together for 5. BIL and I dated during high school, and it ended under circumstances that were not ideal. BIL and I have not gotten along since he and sister got together. My sister essentially believes I'm jealous of her for marrying my ""one who got away"" (he is not that), so our relationship has ALSO suffered as a result. This whole situation is already fucked up and yes, I'm pretty sure it's putting my therapist's kid through college, but that's not the problem right now.

Recently BIL has begun reaching out to me more frequently. I've been very cautious but after talking it over with people in my own life, chose to be more friendly toward him as part of an attempt at repairing certain aspects of my relationship with the entire family. Last week BIL asked if I would read a book he had written, with the underlying implication that I would help him career-wise with his aspirations as a writer. Out of politeness and curiosity, I said sure, thinking I would perhaps get a good laugh out of it and a story to tell my publishing friends.

The book... is about us. I don't know how else to put it. It's a ""domestic thriller"" (so think *Gone Girl, You,* etc.) about a man who realizes he has married ""the wrong sister"" and becomes obsessed with his SIL. It's one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It doesn't exactly read like a manifesto, more like something you'd see on r/menwritingwomen, but aspects of the story were deeply unsettling to me personally (touching on things that happened to me in high school and later), and I don't understand why he would give this to me to read unless he wanted to either creep me out, or - as in the story - he intends to leave my sister and wanted to see if this would... Jesus, it's too weird to say. Open a door with me?

Here's how I'm conflicted. People have always used art as a form of cathartic healing. If a stranger handed me this book, I would just say ""not my taste"" and move on. That said, this is my sister's husband, and I found certain elements so skin-crawlingly uncomfortable that I almost didn't finish it. That ALSO said, this is my sister's husband, and I am afraid, based on the past, that if I tell her about this, she will flip out on me and not him, and/or if she confronts him, he will also just lie about the whole thing? And on the off-chance that it's more than just tasteless catharsis, I don't want my sister to get turned into a skin suit? (There are no skin suits but you get it.) And if it IS just a fictional fantasy thriller, I'll either look like a paranoid asshole or the lawmakers who tried to ban video games after Columbine.

**TLDR: My BIL and I dated in high school and he wrote a really creepy novel about being obsessed with me and I don't know whether to tell my sister for the shitstorm it could cause.**

I don't have a judgement here but - have you thought about asking him if your sister has read it and/or asking her?

"WIBTA if I asked my girlfriend to quit smoking, even though she knows it's my kink?. Okay, so the situaiton is a little weird here. To summarize, I somewhat recently entered a relationship, and it's going well all things considered. We're pretty good with communicating, are willing to indulge the other's interests (even though we didn't have a significant amount of the same interests at the start), and have very compatible opinions and lifestyles. All things considered, it's good. The issue that has arisen, has to do with the fact that she smokes. As it happens, I have a kink that involves women smoking, but I didn't start dating her for that reason (in fact, when we started dating, I was under the impression she had quit, which later turned out not to be true). I brought it up because we were talking about our sexual preferences, and she was actually excited. She likes the fact that I have the kink, because so many guys reject girls who smoke out of hand. I did give it some thought, but in the moment, I ultimately decided that it was not right or healthy to ask that of her. 

Her response to that was lukewarm. She didn't really talk much about it after, except mentioning offhand that she never wanted to quit. Despite my kink, that actually disappointed me. In dating her, I've come to value her more and more, and I'm already terrified of the idea that I'm going to have to see her die of cancer or emphysema in her forties, and live another 40 or 50 years without her (if we end up staying together that long, of course), and yet she seems to have made the choice to die early for the habit. I haven't brought it up since then, because I'm worried we'd get into a full blown fight if I pressed the issue, not to mention her general confusion because of said kink, and I'm wondering if I'd be in the wrong for encouraging her to quit.

TL;DR: My girlfriend smokes, I want her to quit despite having a kink for smoking, and I'm not sure if it's right for me to keep bringing it up.","NAH - Assuming you frame this properly.

It might seem like it doesn't matter, but there's a huge distinction between saying ""I want you to quit smoking"" and ""my partner smoking is a deal breaker for me"". And even though they lead to the same conclusion there's just an inherent difference between the two.  The implication is that obviously she can do whatever she wants; it's her life and all that.  But there are certain decisions you will make depending on her choices.

As long as you go with the second option, make it about you and your needs, you're not an asshole.  And similarly she's not the asshole if she isn't interested in quitting.  Sometimes people break up without anyone doing anything wrong.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for not wanting to call my girlfriend my “significant other”. My girlfriend and I have been dating a couple months, and I’ve called her my girlfriend to friends before but I guess never said the term in front her her.

Significant other sounds... I don’t know weird to me. I asked her why and she said she “just doesn’t like it”.

"WIBTA for missing my little brother's graduation?. So, I have the upcoming opportunity to study abroad for university. It'd mean I could finish a year of foreign language in a little over two months + in an immersive learning environment, get some internship experience, and travel to a place that's been at the top of my bucket list for probably almost a decade. Not only travel there, but live and work there. It'd be a dream come true.

The problem is that it's at a really inconvenient time. 

I'd already be missing spending my own birthday and two of my best friends' birthdays at home, but those are things whose celebrations can be rescheduled.

What can't be rescheduled, however, is my baby brother's high school graduation, which would occur roughly a week after I fly out.

My brother and I aren't *super* close, but he's a good kid who I love very much. On top of this, he's had a really rough time with school, and graduation is kind of a big deal for him. When I originally talked about the study abroad with my parents, they mentioned that it'd conflict with my brother's celebration for graduating, and he interrupted to ask if I'd be there for his graduation itself. I thought I would be at the time, so I said probably. Looking at the calendar, however, it's not looking that way.

I'd still take him out to celebrate (100% paid for by me) before and after, maybe try to video call him day of if possible... but would I be a horrible sibling for not being there? Even if he says it's fine, I still feel bad about it.

However, I'm already having to cut it kind of close with my language studies time frame, and I have a feeling my advisor will really get on my back if I put it off longer than the date I have it planned for, so if I don't do it at that time I may never get to.

"AITA for being incredibly angry at my friend when I learned his feelings towards gay people?. Hey guys, so my friend of more than 10 years came to confide something he was struggling with recently. It turns out he was pretty devastated that his son came out as gay. When asked to explain, he said it could be because he went wrong as a single father. Also, he mostly said he feels terribly sad that he won't have a biological grandson/grandaughter, and as he only had one son before his wife passed away, it would mean that their bloodline would stop. Yes he actually said bloodline, which I don't understand why this would be so important in this day and age anyway. Honestly, I pointed out that it is not too late to start another romantic relationship if he wanted to continue his ""bloodline,"" and I was quite disappointed with his homophobic thoughts, especially when I thought I knew him over the years. Thankfully he hid his disappointment from his son, but I felt quite disgusted with him that day. He says that he supports his son, but if he really did than he would support him wholeheartedly, not in such a grudging, melancholic sort of way he is doing right now. Also, he denies that he is not homophobic, yet still talks about how disappointed he was. It's difficult, because we are still friends, but it is also uncomfortable to think that someone you knew for so long had such a hidden side to them.

"WIBTA if I ask my friends to chip in for a birthday party? We always pay our own way but splitting costs would be cheaper and easier..  

I'm in my late 20s, and my friends are used to paying their own way at birthday parties and chipping in for the birthday person. Usually we'll go to an affordable restaurant and then do an activity such as bowling or an escape room. House parties are potluck, but we never expect the host to pay for activities or restaurants. This is considered normal in my social circle.

This year I'm throwing a birthday party for my husband. I got a good rate for axe throwing. They are charging per lane, not per person, and throwing in a free party room. I'm also hoping to get catering from our favorite restaurant and serve it in the party room: we have a good rapport, and they have been promising us a birthday catering discount. So, the total cost will be much cheaper than if we booked axes per person and did separate checks at the restaurant. We won't know the exact cost per person until we know how many people show up, but we already have enough people confirmed to save at least $10/person. I just feel like it might be seen as rude to ask for help with expenses, even though I'm saving them money. On the other hand, I worry that if I cover everything it might look showy and make them feel pressured to start doing the same on their birthdays.

I don't mind paying more than my share, but it would definitely be a big expense right now to cover everything. Would it be ok to request a specific dollar amount on the Facebook invite? Or say something like ""contributions to the party fund are appreciated""?

I know that in some groups the birthday host pays for everybody and it's ALWAYS inconsiderate to ask. My friends are not one of those groups. In fact, some of them get downright insecure if you seem to be spending a lot of money on them.

Given that I come from a social circle where it is normal for us to pay our own costs for a restaurant and then a group activity on people's birthdays...why should paying for everything in one lump sum change the norms and expectations? Does catering somehow change people's expectations, maybe because they don't get as many choices?  And what about axe throwing: an activity everyone was already on board with...I just found a cheaper and more convenient way to do it.

I kind of have a sense that I might be the asshole if I asked for contributions, but I'm having trouble understanding why.  I don't mind criticism as long as you keep my group's existing norms in mind. I'm not here for black-and-white scolding about the way we've been doing things for years.","NAH

Since you say that this would be a big expense right now it shows that you're aware of the cost so my question would be why didn't you think of the costs before setting up the event? If you ask your friends before sending an invite if they would be ok with doing it your normal way of 'pay your own way' then you wouldn't be in this pickle to begin with. But, that's why they say hindsight is 20/20.

I'd say if you do anything it should be 'contributions to the party fund' would be best since it seems you made the decision to have the sort of party that is planned, or if you haven't booked anything yet then ask your friends real quick.

As for worrying about changing the norm or looking showy, I'd say one-off's are nothing to worry about.

"AITA for thinking my husband is going to be a failure?. Throwaway because I'm too embarrassed to write about this on my main.

My husband recently announced that he wants to pursue stand-up comedy as a career. He plans to work his full time job during the day and do open mic night at different comedy clubs around the area until he ""makes it big."" OK, fine. I don't 100% think this is a good idea, but I will support him completely in his endeavors. 5 years ago when I quit my corporate job to start my own company, my husband provided his unwavering support despite all the naysayers who said I wasn't being smart. Now I have a successful & profitable business that honest to god would never have happened had my husband not believed in me. I want to do the same for him.

Here's the problem: My husband isn't funny. At all. He's practiced a few skits in front of me, and I am having difficulty finding the humor. His material is about work-related issues, the legal system, and double standards between men and women. He makes good points in his presentation but there is no humor to tie any of it together. He sounds like a chronic whiner who is angry and frustrated. He uses a lot of sarcasm but it sounds really bitchy. Instead of a performance, what the audience is getting is a speech. It literally sounds like one coworker complaining to another.

Here's an example straight from his notes:

>*Did you know there is a cop code that an officer shouldn't cite an off-duty officer for breaking a traffic violation? That's pretty shady. I got pulled over for driving 10 over the speed limit cuz my dog was vomiting and shitting blood and I was trying to get her to the emergency vet. It didn't matter to the cop who wrote me the ticket.

"WIBTA if I don’t tell my boss his wife had sex with him to cover up for me running late?. Maybe doesn’t seem like a big deal but it’s eating me up.

I’m staying with my (28M) boss, N (40ishM) and his wife, J(30F)  in their guest room during the week due to commute issues. He runs a small business and we have a somewhat informal schedule, but we wanted to get an early start after the long weekend. I got some cash from relatives at Thanksgiving and REALLY needed to get to the bank and make a deposit before some bills come out today. I mentioned this at dinner last night with both of them.

This morning I woke up an hour later than I intended. I go into the kitchen and J is drinking coffee and dressed for work. She looks at the clock and says “I thought you had to go to the bank?” I was kinda panicking and told her my alarm didn’t go off and I’m gonna get over drafted and I need to make a call about my car payment, etc. She tells me to get ready, go to the bank and don’t worry about being late, she’ll handle N.

I was kinda confused but thanked her and ran to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash up. It shares a wall with their bedroom. Next thing I know I hear her giggle then it sounds like they’re going at it. I was kind of shocked and embarrassed but got ready as fast as I could, went and made my deposit. On my way to work I get a text from my boss that he just got out of the shower, he’ll grab donuts for everyone.

So, should I tell him? Should I ask her to tell him? Having a secret that has to do with “sex” and “my boss’ wife” is making me panic.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend she should work less?. We have been dating for only four months, but we have very long breaks from college (two months) and are relatively long-distance so we haven't seen each other very much for the last while. I really like her so I have tried really hard to keep in contact with her.

My problem is this: she works literally all the time. I didn't notice at first, then one day she mentioned to me that she stayed at work til 4am after starting at 8 in the morning. She told me recently she works 4 days a week for 10 or 12 hours and 2 days a week for 4 hours. She is also studying to be an accountant so on her shorter days and her days off she helps at an office. She also has a lot of university work to complete and has told me she is worried she won't get it done but estimates she then spends about 3 hours on study per day. She has started sleeping over at work and when we Skype I have noticed she lost quite a lot of weight, but says she has not had a chance to exercise at all. 

So a few days ago she said off-handedly about being called in on her day off to cover for a co-worker who's child was ill, and I said she worked too hard. She brushed it off but I insisted and said I was concerned about her and that I thought she needed to cut back on hours and work less. She replied that she felt this was a little presumptuous, as we had only been dating a short time, and I needed to recognise we have very different lifestyles. 

For context: my family is much wealthier than hers and I think she is self-conscious about this. She helps her parents to pay for her fees as well as her sister's. She has said before she doesn't have time for even hobbies. So after we discussed this for a little bit she said ""I'm sorry you didn't realise that this was the way I live when we met but this is the reality for a lot of less-privileged people. I know I'm working a lot, I'm tired and I'm frustrated and I had hoped to rely on your support rather than criticism"". I had only spoken from concern, but now I feel like an asshole.

"AITA for not telling my parents I kind of/probably had an eating disorder in high school?. So when I was in high school (and middle school even), I suffered a lot from disordered eating and anxiety. I didn't gain any weight from the ages of 15 to 18, only lost weight (\~30lbs). It was a really rough time for me overall, and I never told anyone what was going on, even when a few health issues related to it popped up (lost my period for a while, got weird leg and stomach cramps, etc). It was pretty awful. I hardly hung out with friends, I was really good at sports when I was young but dropped off because I didn't have energy anymore, and I remember denying myself dessert even at my own prom. 

&#x200B;

Anyways a lot of that is behind me. I'm 20 years old now and doing better. I've been seeing a therapist for 6 months and my anxiety and depression is improving, and my eating habits have gotten much better over the past year as I've adopted a plant-based diet, starting finding exercise as a source of fun and stress relief instead of a punishment, etc - I have my period back too. All in all, things aren't perfect but I believe I am much better off than when I was in high school. 

&#x200B;

I still live with my parents while I work part-time and go to school. I have recently been talking about my issues and the fact my parents don't really know about them to my therapist. She says it is up to me whether or not I tell them the full extent of my issues. I kind of don't want to. I'm afraid they'll either a) blame themselves b) not believe me or c) freak out and try to control my life and lead me to relapse because they won't believe I was getting better with eating and anxiety on my phone. But at the same time I feel bad for them not knowing what I went through and keeping them in the dark as weird random issues popped up, and part of me would love for them to see how strong I was to crawl out of this hole myself. IDK if I'm ready for this conversation though. 

&#x200B;

AITA for not telling them about my issues and how bad they were in high school, even though I'm doing so much better now?","NAH. As long as it's not relevant information for your parents lives (and based on your description it isn't), it seems perfectly reasonable to keep this information to yourself.

"AITA for asking a leading question?. In my role at work I occasionally have to interview prominent figures in my field for a publication with a reasonably big readership.

I’ve been working on my skills and instincts in this capacity but I guess I don’t always get it right.

One particular instance has been nagging at me and I suspect I may have read the situation wrong. 

Recently one of my superiors hit me with a last minute request to conduct one of these interviews.

I did some research on the person in question and found they had a pretty unique story of having to flee an oppressive government to continue working freely.

Most of the questions I posed were pretty basic but I pushed to include one that touched on this part of their story.

It read: “Your involvement in [redacted] played a major role in your decision to seek asylum from [authoritarian regime].  How does that affect your work?”

I was hoping to provide a meaningful entry into the subject in case this person wanted a chance to address it.

Instead they seemed offended and flipped the question, responding curtly and negatively.

Unfortunately, this was all conducted by email so I had no opportunity to clarify my position in the moment.

Am I the asshole for framing the question this way?","NAH. It sounds like you were angling for something juicy and personal and that the interviewee's response made you question whether the question was off base in the context of that specific interview.

"AITA for refusing sexual intimacy unless I have access to my wife's body? (NSFW). My wife developed some kind of body insecurity after giving birth in November to our first kid. Or it started a few months before this but it really went to 100 afterwards. Before this, she was very body positive, no real shame in the bedroom and I kind of dug it. I'm very attracted to her, even through her pregnancy.

Once she started to lactate, however, she never took her bra off. Plus she'd wear a top on top. Once she gave birth, she always wears underwear and pants now, too. I haven't seen her nude body since November. She said she's embarrassed about her body now and thinks she's unattractive despite my efforts to convince her otherwise.

It's May now. This is still going on. We still are intimate with each other but it's always acts on me and I can never reciprocate. The moment I try to do anything she pushes me away and gets upset. I suggested maybe seeing a therapist or someone to help out and she said something along the lines of her body is disgusting and something to be ashamed of, nothing will change it.

I told her a few nights ago I don't want to be sexually intimate with her unless she's not wearing clothes. I know it's an asshole thing but I think it's justified: she's not going to get over her body insecurity unless we can work on it together and I can show her I still really do find her attractive. She didn't take it well and refused to budge.

Like imagine being in a relationship for four years when all of a sudden your partner asks you to leave the room when they get changed. They'll smack your butt or whatever whenever they want but you can't reciprocate without being yelled at. They call themselves disgusting and are embarrassed about their own skin. That can't be healthy, yeah? I think being an asshole and administering ""tough love"" (or the absence of it, actually) is the right thing to do?","NAH

Intimacy and sexual intimacy is something that should be consensual on both parties and if it’s not something you’re okay with, you don’t have to agree with it. You’re not forcing her to take her clothes off but you’re expressing your needs and wants. It does sound like she needs therapy.

"WIBTA for replacing the money that was stolen from my friend by her family?. My friend and I (both 18F) are in our first year of university and she lives on campus, but is currently visiting her family for the holidays. She is supposed to come back tomorrow.

She was given £90 as Christmas money but she says it’s been stolen by someone in her family.
My friend comes from a low income background. She has 3 sisters and her mum cannot work. She also doesn’t have a dad. She doesn’t work during the semester (she has a job at the town she’s from but only works there when she’s visiting her family - so not very often, and it pays minimum wage) She relies on student loans to pay for rent and food. However I come from a middle class background, my parents are still together and I have a well paying job (for a teenager). I have a lot more money than her.

I want to give her the £90 because she needs it more than I do but she won’t let me because she said she would feel guilty and she’s more upset that a family member stole it. I don’t think she would be angry at me for not understanding that she cares more that it was family, I’m worried that she will feel guilty and try to return it to me (sneak it into my bag or something) 

I have a plan to hide it somewhere in her room and then once I go home I would message her and say “look under your pillow I left something for you” next week but I don’t know if she would be upset. I would feel guilty to see her struggle and go without when I could give her the £90 and not really miss it.

"WIBTA if I legally changed my firstname even though I was named in memory of my late Father?. Throwaway account but honestly if my family ends up finding this post I'll cope. 

Backstory: When my Mom was 5 months pregnant with me my Dad was seriously injured in a car accident and later died in hospital. So when my Mom gave birth, she named me after my deceased father. 

I am 22 now,  and I've always hated my firstname. For the sake of this post let's just say my first name is Humphrey (believe me,  it's really much worse than Humphrey). 

My friends don't even call me by Humphrey anymore because they know I hate it. I was the subject of bullying when I was younger because of my weight issues and also because  my firstname was the same name as a stupid character from a TV show.

I have a much better nickname, let's just say Harry,  that has always stuck. In my mind,  Harry feels more like my true name than my legal firstname. 

So I want to legally change my firstname to Harry and get rid of the name Humphrey for good ... but I know it will really upset my family,  especially my Dads side of the family. I don't mean any ill will to the memory of my Dad,  but I just really hate the name itself with a passion. 

In the past when I've expressed hatred of my name or joked that I wanted it legally changed,  my Mom would really guilt trip me about it. She doesn't even like it when other people refer to me as Harry because she sees me carrying my Dads firstname Humphrey like a legacy to him.

And no,  I don't want Humphrey as my middle name either. The name is just associated in my mind with bullying and bad memories and I don't want to be identified with that name at all.

 I have PCOS, which makes things even more unbearable for me. Sometimes it's so painful I can barely move without feeling like shit- and today was one of those days. I just started today, and I quickly bled through two layers of feminine products in under an hour, including my pants 🙃. The first two days are always like this, so I can't except to change 4 times during a 6 hour long festival. They're pretty irregular, so if I knew that my period would've came the day of the music festival I would've declined in advance, but now I feel kind of obligated to attend.

"WIBTA if I told my mom how I feel about her boyfriend. Throwaway account.

I am 16M.

My bio dad and my mom got a divorce when I was 12. Neither of them did anything horribly wrong, they just weren't compatible. It was a clean divorce and they get along well. There are no longstanding issues.

I spend the majority of my time living with my mom and her boyfriend since her house is closer to my high school, but I recently spent spring break at my dad's house. I brought this up with him, and he said I should stay out of it. My friends are also giving me mixed advice, which is why I'm posting here.

My mom has been dating this guy for about two and a half months now. Why they thought it was a good idea to move in so quickly is beyond me, but that's beside the point. Well, it's not beyond me why HE wanted to move in, but I'll get to that. Overall, this guy is okay. I'm not going to say hes great, or even good. But he's tolerable. We both don't like each other, and we both know it. Neither one of us has explicitly said nor done anything; we are not trying to start shit. We manage to just coexist.

I don't so much care about my relationship with him. I have a dad, he lives 15 minutes away and we have a good relationship. I have my driver's license I can go see him whenever I want. The only thing that really matters to me is his effect on my mom and on my younger sister (10 years old). 

My mom usually seems to be happy with him. Happier than when she was single, at least. There are no major problems at the moment, but I feel like there are some red flags that shouldn't be ignored. 

First off, he drinks too much. I'm not going to say he's an alcoholic, it's not that bad (yet). But once a week or so, he gets home real late at night a little tipsy. He's definitely not the type of person I want my mom being with when he's drunk. He's not physically violent, but he has a shortened fuse and is always looking for something to complain about. I can see how sad my mom gets, and how scared my sister gets when he's like this. There is a high probability, in my opinion, that things could get worse. It really would only take one more bump in the road for him to completely fall off. I think it's best if we get out of this situation before the inevitable.

Secondly, he's just a self-centered person. Everything he does is about him/ for him. He never does ANYTHING for other people. And when he does, it's always with a groan and because he has to. It's not like he's out working long hours to put food on the table either. He works four half-days per week bagging groceries. I, a 16 year old, work more hours, at a harder job, to get more money, and go to school at the same time. He basically uses my mom for a house and for sex (which there is a LOT of, not that it matters, really).

So, reddit, WIBTA if I talked to my mom and told her that I don't think this man is good for her/us in the future?","NAH. I think it's fair to bring this up especially with how fast this has moved. I know that after a divorce there's a longing for happiness and ""stability"", so a parent may rush into a relationship fast.

I'd start off the conversation about his drinking (especially since it's scaring both you, your mom, and your little sister).

The two of us are in a gaming community with Sarah,  and about a week ago we agreed to allow her to move cross country to stay with us to escape an abusive partner and have a fresh start. 

While we were figuring out the process of moving Sarah in, her and Adam developed a small fling with the disclaimer that it wasn’t set in stone until they got a feel for each other in person.  2-3 days after she got here she broke things off with Adam because she noticed things that reminded her of ex, and didn’t want to be put back in that dynamic.

Sarah should have waited to fuck her new roommate, but sometimes after a big emotional event - like moving across the country to escape an abusive partner - you need to work some stuff out and fucking's the best option.

The pastor talked about my grandmother maybe 30% of the time, and the rest of the time he preached a fire-and-brimstone, “gods way is the only way, accept him or go to hell” sermon, shouting a lot of the time.

So we decided to cancel the accommodation because it felt like the host was dodgy and it was in a developing country and we just wanted to kick off the holiday on a high and safe note. We decided to cancel the first AirBnb.  I then said I will pay for a hotel to replace the accommodation, but I will escalate the matter with AirBnB to try and get full refunds. I offered to do this because I felt bad that we paid so much money and that we wen't getting anywhere close to a refund. AirBNB originally said that we would only get the cleaning fee back. Because we split the costs on the app we each got 5 dollars back.

My mother started forgetting easy things within a few months of his death. Could no longer write cheques to pay bills. Could no longer drive. She fell into a deep depression where she would literally sit in the same easy chair all day and evenings. I know because I was taking my kids over to visit her almost every day during that first year. It got to the point where she smelled like ass and I mean BADLY!

My sister (I have 2) lived in the other part of the country so she had no idea what was happening other than the fact my other sister and I kept her up to date on our mother's degrading mental situation. But for some reason, I consider it human nature, she never really absorbed what we were telling her. She seemed to think we were making a bit of it up, that our mother wasn't as bad as we were making it sound.

So one day she finally comes to visit my mother. She was in a non-care home because she couldn't live alone anymore. I mean non-care in the sense that my mother still had to do some every day things but didn't have to cook or wash clothes. That was all taken care of for her.

I also have to say during this time my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

Anyways, my sister comes to town and I take her to visit our mother. My mother doesn't recognize my sister since she hasn't been around to visit. She came to our father's funeral but it was quite a few years that she's been around. 

So my mother says she has to go to the washroom. My sister seems to think ""if she can go to the bathroom then her mind isn't as bad as my family has been telling me"". And she says it out loud to me.

Long story short, my mother didn't raise the lid and sat down directly onto the lid. She proceeded to take a massive shit while sitting down. 

My sister finally goes into the bathroom to see what's taking so long and comes to tell me what  our mother did.

I kind of laughed and told her she had to clean up our mother and the toilet seat since she thought my sister and I were exaggerating to her for the past while.

I have to say my sister took it well and did what she was asked. She also told me she should have believed us when we told her how bad our mother went downhill.

I ask AITA because I could have easily helped her clean up our mother but didn't out of anger and spite.","> I could have easily helped her clean up our mother but didn't out of anger and spite.

"AITA for singing an annoying song at my kids?. So there's this song on YouTube that has gone viral recently. It's very popular with toddlers, not so much with anyone who knows how to speak in complete sentences. It's about a certain type of cartilaginous fish that had a famous movie made about it.

Yesterday I discovered that if I threaten to sing this song in front of my kids, I can get them to do stuff like finish their dinner or get dressed quickly. I'm willing to let my sanity take the hit, but AITA for getting it stuck in their heads-do-do-do-do?","NAH, but fuck you for getting that stuck in my head now right before I go to bed haha.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for requiring payment from a charity service?.  

Hear me out here. TLDR at the bottom.

I play bagpipes. In my hometown we have a few events with bagpipes. When it comes to charity I often play for free, or at cheaper rate. 10 years of practice on a specialty instrument isn't common in my town. However, I usually need notice to take time off my regular work for the event.

I got a phone call around 10a, while I was working. At lunch(3p) I had a voicemail. The DJ service from the event had been trying to find a bagpiper, after a few calls they were directed to me. The event was at 5pm that night and they asked if I could play.

At this time I didnt know I was speaking with the DJ and not the organizer.

I was working, so I reached out to a student of mine to see if they could. I had played this event in the past and it should have been easy for my students. But, they were unavailable. So I asked my boss if I could leave early to play the gig, and was given the OK. To get to this event I had to drive an hour to my apartment for my pipes, then an hour to the event. 

I arrived just after 5pm to be told the event was in fact at 6pm.

As I said, this should be easy for my student, who only has a year of practice so far. But, that was a lie. In the past, I have led a parade of Gentlemen down the street and to the local courthouse for the event. Simple, 2 or 3 marches and done. Walking on the sidewalks, no obstacles, super easy.

Not this year... The Gentlemen were all pretty drunk, and passing bottles with the organizers when I arrived.. They did not have a plan for where they wanted to parade, gave me some vague idea and we started. There were tents and chairs on most of the sidewalks this year, so navigating was going to be a bit more difficult. When we started, it was great until one of the Gentlemen started going me directions on which way to go, telling me to go faster and slower, essentially tripling the amount of playing. And, at the very end, instructing me to lead them through traffic intentionally to stop cars. I was a bit annoyed.

At the end of the event, I was not recognized at all. When I requested payment from the organizer (after realizing it wasnt the DJ) they had assumed I would be playing for free for the charity event. I was told all Payments were to be discussed and settled before the event. This sucked, considering I left my job in the middle of the day, on a last minute notice to join their event.

In my opinion, charity event or not, if you ask someone on the DAY OF to perform at an event, you should expect to pay them. I gave them a hefty discount (\~70% off) on my normal rates due to the charitable nature of the event. They did eventually pay me about two weeks after the event.

TLDR: I left work halfway through my day, drove 3 hours, and performed a specialized service at a charitable event when requested with less than 12 hours of notice. The Charity did not expect to need to pay me for this. (Given ample notice I do often play charity events for free)","NAH. They didn't know they were supposed to pay you (since the DJ organized it, and probably said it was free) and you didn't know you were playing for free.

"AITA telling the dude behind me to stop shaking his leg. I sit down after boarding the flight. About 5 minutes in my seat starts vibrating.

I turn around, ask him to stop shaking his leg cause its shaking my chair. He didn't seem very happy I asked him, kinda gave me a dirty look.

"AITA for taking a holiday to Florida and subsequently missing a week of school?. Tomorrow, I am going on holiday to Florida for two weeks. Of course I am excited but my school is definitely not happy. 

And understandably as well. I will be missing school for Thurday, Friday and all of next week. No school likes the idea of a vacation during school time especially during my time. Currently, I am in Y13, which is the highest year in Secondary School education in the U.K. which is the year I do my A-Levels, the really big exams which decide if I go to Uni or any other higher education. As a school, they would be mad and they are angry at me for this as well as my family. They want me to be in school each they to study and for of course good intentions. 

So missing a week of school in Y13 means I will miss lots of lessons and information. So as you can see, my school does have a good argument but what the fuck can I do? Heres my side. 

I’m not just going to Florida with my family, I am also going with my extended family with my aunts, uncles, cousins and my grandparents which I don’t get to see that often, I value my time with them. This is because they live in Ireland. I live in the UK. So you understand why I value my time with them, they live in a completely other country. 

This trip has been planned for a long time too. Christmas of 2017 to be exact. With this amount of time and effort going into this, am I really a bad person for declining this. Not to mention everything has been paid for such as my accommodation, the trips and even new clothes bought by my family for this trip. This trip means a lot to my whole family. 

And also, its Florida. Look, my family isn’t necessarily the richest, we are definitely working class in the UK. My family works day and night for these sorts of experiences, I should have the right the go, its an experience of a life time, I will never get an opportunity to go again.

"AITA for telling my girlfriend she sleeps too much?. Hi there, I’m pretty new to Reddit. A few months ago, I (20m) started dating this girl (20f). She’s extremely funny and smart. We share a lot of the same goals, and I’m really happy I found her. 
She broke her foot a little while after we got together and hasn’t been able to walk on it all summer really. Not only can she not work, but she constantly needs help with simple things, like running errands and getting out to her car. I know she’s been having a very tough time dealing with it since she’s always been very hardworking and independent. I’ve done my best to support her and try to lift her spirits. 

My main problem here is that she’s always sleeping when we’re together. We live about an hour apart, and with my work schedule, I only get to see her on weekends or every other weekend. When she’s here, she divebombs straight for my bed and spends most of her time there. She likes to nap for a few hours each day then she’s always the first to fall asleep, which is fine, except she won’t wake up till around 11-12 the next day. Trying to wake her up is pointless. All in all, we really don’t get to spend much time together. I don’t really feel as if I have a girlfriend. I’ve expressed to her multiple times that I don’t like that she basically only comes over to sleep, and it always upsets her. She says she’s not usually like that, which is true. Before breaking her foot, she was working around 40 hours a week on top of going to school. She says she doesn’t mean to, she just hasn’t been herself since she broke her foot, and she has trouble sleeping when she’s at home. Being with me is a comfort to her. I know she’s been having problems at home with her father, so I try not to push the issue too much, but it bothers me. I don’t get to see her as often as I’d like, and I just want to spend quality time with her. 

In a week, she’ll be cleared to walk again, so I’m hoping that starts to make a difference. I feel bad for upsetting her, but I need to know if I’m the asshole for telling her how I feel.",I think your girlfriend is depressed.,0,0,0,1,0
"WIBTA if I ask my aunt to buy me something for Diwali?. Info: Diwali is a Hindu festival about lights, and it’s normal to exchange gifts between each other. 

Let’s begin. 

So, recently I’ve been wanting to get a new gaming mouse (more specifically the Razer DeathAdder Elite). I asked my dad at first and he said no, that my mouse I currently had was fine (it is too small for me, a fact I have made clear multiple times but he keeps dismissing the fact as ‘bullshit’). With him saying no and me visiting my Aunt’s soon, I thought about asking her to buy it. However, I felt that asking her to buy anything is a dick move. And that’s when I decided to post my situation here.

Edit 1: turns out my parents are not okay with me asking her. So I won’t be asking her. Thanks to everyone who replied tho!","Indian Checking In! *REPRESENT*

YWNBTA in my opinion. My aunts/uncles always ask what I want for Birthday's/Diwali/Post Exam Gifts ect. I usually say ""Nothing particular."" Because I don't want to take advantage of their kindness.

"AITA for being upset my friend made homemade soup very late at night. Obligatory I’m on mobile.

I(21F) live with my college friend(22F) and her parents(50M/F). I am eternally grateful to all of them for giving me a place to live after I had to leave college.

I help out with the housework and taking care of their dogs (I don’t pay rent, tho if they asked I would in a heartbeat) just so I am contributing. They are fairly well off so my existence isn’t a huge burden on them, and they appreciate the work I can do with their dogs, or around the house/lawn. Her parents cook for all of us most nights.

They are going to be gone this weekend, and I figured it would be easier for us to coordinate cooking. My friend is Very into cooking, she owns a library of cookbooks and has often tries super elaborate things. She’s also a bit chaotic in the kitchen, she’s set two (small, easily put out) fires in the last year and she usually makes a huge mess that she doesn’t always clean up. 

I get home between 9:30-10pm on Sat and 9-9:30 pm on Sun, so I asked her if she wanted to do grilled cheese and tomato soup for dinner-I said something like “the canned soup is actually pretty good if you add some cream.” She said “or we could make soup.” I was hesitantly like “I mean I guess” bc I know that she’s super into making homemade soup but I was looking for something quick.

I asked her to go to the store bc she doesn’t work weekends, and she texts me that she got 4 pounds of tomatoes. I say “oh god”. I get home at 9:45, I ask her if she wants to start dinner (Both of us had light food earlier) and she was wrapped up in something on her laptop, so by the time we started it was 10:15. Another note, I would have been perfectly happy to do this meal by myself, if she would have said no. 

I help her get the tomatoes ready to roast, and they roast for 35 minutes. I was surprised, so I went looked at her recipe, and the time for the soup was 1 hour and 45 minutes. And we started at 10:15.

I was upset that she had waited so long to start, bc I had wanted to do canned soup so that it was faster, but I didn’t want to say anything while she was cooking. At about 11 I lheaded downstairs and got ready for bed. She told me she would finish the soup and put it away and then come down. She wasn’t finished with it until midnight, so it would have been after midnight before we could have even started the other part of dinner.

She asked why I was upset and I said that I had wanted canned soup bc it was fast, and that it was inconsiderate of her to not start the soup before I got homeif she on homemade soup. She said that she didn’t bc it was something we were supposed to do together, and that she doesn’t even like grilled cheese and tomato soup. She didn’t have to agree to eat it if that was that case.

I think it was rude of her to drag me through a 2+ hour cooking experience after 10pm, but she is very offended that I was upset so I’m unsure.

EDIT: because I guess this was unclear. I was excited and supportive of her making soup. She Loves to make soup, like more than I can explain, which is why I left the canned vs. homemade up to her. What I was upset about is instead of getting home and quickly being able to simmer soup and start on grilled cheese (my responsibility for the meal, so no she wasn’t cooking just for me) I had to wait 30 minutes to get her to start a recipe that takes almost 2 hours. So I wouldn’t have gotten to eat until midnight. If I’m an AH for being upset about this then so be it, but what I was mad about was the fact that she changed the time table so drastically and expected me to be cool with eating at midnight-she never told me the time frame for the recipe she chose-I was not at all upset about the decision to make homemade soup in and of itself.

EDIT 2: My friend and I talked and we both realized we just missed each other with what we were expecting. We’re completely amicable and just moved the dinner to tonight-she admitted she does like it, as long as you don’t make the sandwiches with Kraft, she just wanted to make me feel bad in a moment of anger. I showed her this thread and the comments have helped both of us see both sides, and we’re getting a good laugh at the ones calling me entitled because of my living situation. Thanks guys, and keep voting bc I’m curious about the final verdict :)",She can cook something that late if she wants and you can just make canned soup if you want. It doesn’t have to be one or the other. Just speak up next time and tell her before instead of waiting hours to finally tell her how you feel. NAH,0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for not wanting to kick out my mother? Or freely give her a clean slate?. My relationship with my mother is a bad one. Recently I had to have her committed to the hospital for a mental break and while she was there they found a brain tumor. During her month at the hospital she decided to break up with her long time  boyfriend and rendered herself homeless. 

Not to sound self-absorbed but all of this has been super overwhelming for me.

Not everyday is a bad day, but reliving my childhood and its unpredictablilty has been depressing. My husband doesnt want that for me and he wants to kick her out. The only other place she has to go right now is my grandfather's. They have similar relationship. He also is much older, has COPD, heart problems, cant bend down to clean up after her and he has to hide his pain meds when she is around. 

Her fights with me are mainly about the surgery,me not believing her delusions and her wanting a clean slate so we can repair our relationship. 

I am happy to work on our relationship and give her a clean slate but first I want to be able to talk with her about everything that happened over the years. I know I wont be able to move on without that. 

She says there isnt a point to trying to fix things with me if I just want to keep rubbing everything she did wrong in her face to hurt her. I feel that's entirely unreasonable as all I want to do is actually be able to speak for once and feel heard. 

She however, isnt willing to do things the way I need and instead as usual wants to do things her way or the highway. So I feel in the right by standing my ground for once and saying she needs to hear me out before we can start over. 

Her surgery was supposed to be at the end of this month. However, it's gotten moved back because she has a really bad mouth/gum infection. She wanted to cancel anyway because she lost faith in the hospital, so she wanted to find a new one. Some of her concerns are reasonable but it is frustrating. 

My hubby wanted to kick her out when he found out she didnt want to get the surgery done at the hospital everything is arranged at. I went through a lot of trouble making the arrangements as she cant drive from a DUI and doesnt have a car. I called in favors with friends and everything to make sure she could get there. 

He doesnt like how she treats me and the effect it has on me and she is generally a bad house guest. 

She may be mean to me, and a lot of trouble but shes my mother and she might be dying.","Damn I am so sorry for you to be in this situation. In no way, shape or form are you the asshole.

How much of her mental health issues have been caused by the tumor do you think? If the answer is most of them: then I say do what you can to fully support your mom. However, if the tumor isn’t affecting her that way then I would recommend to set some firm limits with her about how you and your husband expect to be treated is she continues staying with you.

"WIBTA for planning a surprise gender/pregnancy reveal, since my sister is struggling with infertility?. I am currently 9 weeks pregnant with my second child and will be finding out the gender in about 3 weeks via chromosomal testing. Once we find out the chromosomal testing is normal and also the gender, we thought it would be really fun to plan a get together with our close friends and family (like our parents, my sister and her husband, my grandma and maybe a couple close friends) 

We were going to tell everyone the party was for my 30th birthday which will fall around the same time, but then dress my son in a ""brother"" shirt and possibly put an ultrasound picture on display. 

The ""birthday"" cake would serve as a gender reveal for extra fun. 

In general I dont *love* the idea of preplanned gender reveal parties because I feel people are feeling obligated to bring a baby gift and it's a grab. This way that doesnt happen but we get to celebrate with our closest family and friends. 

The complicated factor here is that my sister is having some struggles with infertility, and has been TTC since Nov, had 1 MC and no other luck. She took the news of my pregnancy really hard at first (I told her already nobody else besides my husband knows) but she has warmed up a bit. 

I'm still really wary of oversharing or overdoing it around her, but I want to celebrate this baby the same way I celebrate my first. 

So WIBTA for planning this type of party and inviting her? I cant *not* invite her...


**edit: meant to mention that I would tell her ahead of time what I was planning on doing and tell her I would in no way be upset if she didnt come.
2nd edit: thanks everyone for your insight. It seems like alot of people ITT and maybe reddit just dont like gender reveals. To each their own opinions. Every member of the party I'd invite would be *asking* me ""when will you find out the baby's gender? Let me know when you know!"" So I'm not sure having them there when we find out would be offensive to anyone. 
And if my son or daughter is transgender and tells me that they are actually the other gender in 10 years, I'd love them no different and support them no matter what.... but I cant help if they are born with a penis or vagina in 7 months and finding out and knowing that information and sharing it with family seems relatively harmless. 
I'm still deciding what I'll do ultimately. Thanks everyone!**","NAH.

But I **would** tell your sister what the party is for before hand.  Sit down (alone) and explain - give *her* the chance to opt out if she wants to.  Don't put pressure on her to go.

"AITA for arguing with my fiance to seek help from a professor about her internship?. For background:

My fiance and I are both currently in our student teaching semester of our Education degree. My fiance has been placed to intern with a K-4 Elementary Music teacher.

Her internship teacher has been very forward about the fact that he wanted an intern so that he wouldn't have to do his job. He immediately began giving her tasks such as being in charge of videoing the students for announcements, teaching full grades, spontaneously letting her know it's her turn to teach (all in the first week), having her fulfill duties regarding his non-academic YouTube channel. He went as far as to say ""You're paying me for you to teach my class.""

Some of it is good experience, if my fiance was ready for it. She has come home almost every day, beaten and mentally exhausted. Today, in week 3, she came home and informed me that her teacher told her ""I don't think I'm getting my return on investment with you."" She is a very nonconfrontational person so she held it in until she got home.

When I got home, she told me the story and that she almost went in to change her degree. My response was ""Email Professor [in charge] so she can give you advice about what to do about your teacher."" My fiance believes that it will be a waste of time and that she is going to be told to just change her major. After a bit of back and forth about her emailing a few of our professors for help, she finally blew up on me for pushing her to do something when she just wanted to vent.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: I suggested she email our professor to help with her intern teacher, not changing her degree.","No A-holes here. 

You’re not an asshole for suggesting something and she’s not an asshole for wanting to change her degree.

It seems like she could just be exhausted to the point of looking for the easiest option (a degree change) to avoid the PT of that email and what it entails.

"AITA for turning on the light when I get ready in the morning?. This is a bit of a ongoing issue I have...

My girlfriend stays with me 99 percent of the time but has her own place, she doesn't stay there and stays with me.

I get up at 5:30 every morning for work, she works at 9am so gets up after I leave in the morning.

I live in a loft style bachelor apartment, it's big for a bachelor but the main area is still all one room except for the kitchen and bathroom.  I have a remote controller three direction light on the ceiling. It shines a light towards one wall, the other and then onto the loft bed. When I wake up in the morning after my alarm goes off I use the remote and turn on two of the lights and leave the one facing my bed off. This is so it does not shine directly on the bed. I also put the radio on in the kitchen to listen to the news when I get up.

My girlfriend constantly get mad at me in the mornings for turning the radio and lights on so early. She wants me to turn on a little lamp that's below the loft and does not light up the whole room. If I did this I would be fumbling around in the dark, trying to locate all my things to get ready and go and it would generally be a struggle every morning. She also wants me to not turn on the radio as it bothers her but it helps wake me up and start my day.

"AITA for not moving my MIL's funeral to accommodate her daughter?. Preemptive apologies for the length.

So, my MIL passed away Christmas Eve and I'm currently planning her funeral. The funeral is planned for this upcoming Tuesday, New Year's Eve. My SIL is an ER doctor who works across the country and Tuesday doesn't work for her. She stated that with the travel distance and Christmas/New Year's she's having issues finding a cover. She's asking me to move the funeral to a later date so she can attend.

For context, my MIL was a devout Jewish woman, to the point where I had to convert to marry into the family. She was very close with my husband and myself and made it clear to us that she wants an Orthodox Jewish burial. She even informed me of the rabbi she would like to hold the service and has a plot in an strictly orthodox cemetery. When my FIL passed in 2014, she did everything to ensure the funeral was orthodox.

Part of the rules for a Jewish burial is that the body a) cannot be altered/preserved in any way and b) must be buried more or less instantly after death. (The only reason we're waiting a week is that you can't hold a funeral on holidays, and it's currently Chanukah.) The cemetery is being difficult in terms of acceptable wait times to help keep the funeral orthodox, and should it not be she won't be allowed to be buried there next to her husband. The rabbi my MIL selected also won't do it if it isn't orthodox, as part of the rules for a Jewish burial is that all directions left by the deceased *must* be followed. My SIL said she'd find a new place to bury her and that we can find a different rabbi too, though from my research it seems that no local orthodox rabbis or cemeteries will participate in a funeral that breaks any rules.

I spoke to my husband and he's very insistent that we respect his mother's wishes and I agree with him, as it's her body, even if she's no longer alive. My SIL and her husband are very insistent that funerals are for the living and that, as she's dead, she won't even know. She also mentioned that as her daughter she should have more of a say (vs. me, the DIL, not my husband). We are still talking to see if anything would work for her, like her planning the [unveiling service](https://www.shiva.com/learning-center/death-and-mourning/unveiling/), but I have remained firm in my choice to not move the funeral, and she blames me for worsening her pain. So, AITA for not moving it?","NAH - you both have good reasons for what you're asking.

"AITA: I stopped talking to my mom, she doesn't know why. Repost, TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm 18 years old and live with my dad. My parents divorced when I was 9, and both remarried a few years ago. Since I was about 13 I started having problems mentally, but kept it to myself. Although my mom and I had a very good relationship, I didn't have the courage to tell her anything about heavier subjects.

Until just over a year ago, I lived periodically with my mom and dad; one week there, one week here. Although, it was a bit different the last year as my mom was living her husband which was way longer than 10 minutes away as it usually is. I stopped moving back and forth then because I was really tired. I decided to live with my dad, because that's where my best friend lived. 

I finally managed to get some help, started seeing a psychologist. I've noticed one of our main topics have been my mom. After I stopped moving back and forth, I pretty much stopped visiting her at all. I felt quite guilty about it, because my mom always seemed so sad that I didn't. She would always ask ""When are you coming over?"", to which I didn't know how to answer, I didn't really want to. Thinking of visiting my mother made me so tired I felt like I didn't have the energy to move. I also brought up that my mom was depressed when I was young, and it was really bad. I think that's the root of the problem, as I started taking care of others' needs, rather than mine, even at the cost of my own well being.

I told my mom that I was seeng a psychologist pretty quickly. She had asked me when I would come over during easter, and I was too scared to answer her for several days because I knew that I didn't want to. I told her I wanted to stay with dad, but she tried to get a ""why"" out of me, so I sent her a long message trying to explain a few things. After that I kept getting scared whenever my phone would vibrate, thinking it was a message from her that I had to answer. Would I have to make her sad/dissapointed/confused again? I honestly wanted to sweep it all under a rug and forget about it.

Because I don't talk to my mom about heavier stuff, she doesn't understand or know just how bad it's been for me. From her point of view, I just suddenly stopped talking to her without telling her why. Honestly, I know I should, but I panick at just the thought, I'm not ready. I can't even tell her that because I don't want to dissapoint or worry her, and I also feel like the problem then would be more real.

Basically (TL;DR) I have mental illness issues that I think are due to growing up with a mentally ill mother. About a year ago I mostly stopped seeing her and talking to her, and I feel very guilty about it. From her point of view, it came out of nowhere and she has no Idea why it's like that and she's trying to get me to talk. My step mom, though, finds it odd how my mom couldn't see my problems as she herself could see them very clearly.

AITA for not  having told her yet?","NAH- you are having trouble. It happens. But you’re aware of it and I really think you should give your mom an explanation. I think you should bring this up with your psychologist, not us.",0,0,0,1,0

"WIBTA for going on a camping trip when my friend needs me the most?. Theres a lot to put here, so if you need any extra info just ask.

I have a vast history of mental health issues, spent far too much of my life in psych wards. I used to hurt myself every night various ways. Basically depression, anxiety and insomnia damn near killed me.

This weekend a bunch of friends and I were gonna go camping in the middle of nowhere. However on Tuesday a friend was feeling very low and I was very worried and because I don't have my license yet I called the police and asked them to do a check on her then asked my housemate to speed to her house. 

Major TW here. 

We found her on the ground covered in blood, cuts on her wrists, neck and thighs. She had overdosed, unconscious, not breathing, shoelace around her neck. Called ambo and started cpr. Once they took her to hospital I went into her room and found alcohol, pills and razors. I threw them all in the bin and cleaned the blood and vomit as best I could.

We visited the next day, in her room I couldn't say anything. It was too much, she was saying all the things I used to say. No one cares, you'd be better off without me, why are you even here why do you care. 
I had planned on saying all the things I wished someone had said to me, I'd planned on being there for her and staying as long as it took. Instead, I had to dig my nails into my thumb just to stop myself from losing my shit. 

When we got home I spent hours screaming and crying, all the shit memories I'd blocked came flooding back and my urges to hurt myself came back. 

I can't do this, I can't go back and visit and I can't be there for her. I feel like I need to get away. I'm scared that if I keep trying to support my friend, it'll end badly for me.

If you can't handle it, you can't handle it. Don't risk your own health.  But I would try to explain to her that you're not blowing her off, that you don't think you can handle it right now and why, and that you'll be thinking about her on the trip and hoping she's okay.  Hopefully she'll understand, and hopefully you'll be able to enjoy yourself on the trip.

"AITA for telling my wife we can’t afford an outfit for her nursing school pinning?. To give you the most accurate representation of everything I’ll give you as many facts as possible. 

To be fair, she is the bread winner of the family. I’m still in school and she is working and earning more money than I am. However, we’ve decided on a budget together and we’re trying to stick to the mentality of “live like we’re poor”. 

We have set aside in the budget $80 “fun money” each to spend on fun stuff each month. So she has money she could spend. She also has a closet full of clothes that I don’t understand why she can’t wear something from that. 

I hate telling her we can’t afford stuff, because  she does make most of the money, but she did go over her “fun money” budget by $220 last month.

"WIBTA if I brought up the amount of time colleagues spend smoking at work?. Would I be the asshole for bringing up the amount of time my colleagues spend outside on cigarette breaks during paid working time? I'm sorry if its been mentioned before. 

I work in a small office of 20 people. Some of my colleagues smoke and are out on cigarette breaks 4+ times a day for at least 5 minutes. Doing the math, it works out they spend around 20 mins per day, 100 mins per week, 400 mins per month - which equates to 6.6666 hours per month smoking on paid work time. This roughly equates to a days leave time (7.5 hours) per month, which is crazy.

Having been a smoker in my teens, I understand the want to go and smoke so am not disliking them for doing what they enjoy. However I feel it is unfair that those choosing not to smoke do not receive the same break time, i doubt I'd be allowed 20 minutes a day to stand outside for a 'fresh air' break - if you know what I mean? 

Not sure how to approach the situation, however I do feel something needs to be done. Would I be the asshole for taking some sort of action?

She knows how I am and supposedly knows how I feel even if I don’t show it.

You're not a bad person for having trouble expressing your feelings.

Mind you:

For a whole bunch of reasons it would probably be good to work on being able to show/express your feelings with someone who loves you and is okay with you being awkward about it. She'll probably appreciate the effort, and you'll be prepared for dealing with other people in the future who are less accustomed to you.

Even if you stumble over it, just: ""You are a really good friend and I appreciate you. I think you're great and I want you to know that your friendship means the world to me,"" *no matter how awkwardly you say it*, that still is meaningful.

Plan it in advance.

Hell, show her this post and say: ""I wrote this.""

Expressing your feelings is hard but it gets easier with practice.

And I can tell you, as someone who's been on the receiving end of the awkward, stumbling declaration of sincere platonic affection?

I hold that to my heart, because it really, truly does mean a lot to me. It means so much because it's *not* easy, but to know that someone I love loves me back, and loves me enough to want to tell me *even though that's so clearly hard for them*?

"AITA for not accepting help in the kitchen from my chef brother but asking my mom for help?. Throwaway because this isn’t a sub I normally frequent. 

I like to cook. I’ve especially gotten into it in the last year and a half when I decided to go vegetarian and learn how to cook without meat. I (20F) live with my parents and my brother (30M). I cook a vegetarian meal for us all, or at least my mom and I, 1-2 times a week. 

Sometimes but not always when I’m cooking for everyone or making dishes for a family gathering, my brother will ask if I or my mom and I need any help. Sometimes my mom says yes but I always say no and here’s why. 

My brother is a chef, so he’s a good cook but also a perfectionist. He’ll take over the entire kitchen to do one tiny thing and make a lot of noise whilst doing it. I cook because I find peace in it and his cooking is not peaceful. He always insists on making ridiculous amounts of food sometimes that never get all eaten (he absolutely INSISTED once that 1 box of spaghetti wasn’t enough for 4 people and threw a fit until I agreed to make 2 full boxes. We didn’t eat all of it like I thought and had to throw some out because no one wanted spaghetti 3 nights in a row :/) 

I know he’s a chef so you’d think he knows how to work around other people in a kitchen but he doesn’t. He also doesn’t understand “let’s eat while it’s hot” and things go cold. He’s obsessed with everything being perfect and I understand it’s because he’s a chef by trade but Jesus sometimes at home after a long day I don’t care if it’s perfect I just want it ready and to eat. 

Basically I find his presence in the kitchen overbearing and unhelpful. It’s more stressful than helpful for me and I feel like he often takes away from what I’m trying to do. He also never really does his own dishes when he cooks so I don’t want him to help and then have 300 unnecessary dishes to wash from a salad dressing. So I always say no when he asks if I need help (which isn’t often - but often enough). 

However if I really do need help or my mom asks, I let her help me in the kitchen. She and I really know how to work around each other and do so almost everyday when I prepare a vegetarian meal at the same time as their meat dinner. I find my moms presence in the kitchen relaxing and calming. 

This came up today when I was cooking dinner for everyone. I ran into what I thought was a bit of a problem and asked my mom to come see. My brother jumped up to say “its fine mom I can help” and I said I wanted mom’s help. He said he could come too and I said 3 people in our small kitchen is too much! Just mom is okay. He got kind of huffy and accused me of thinking he didn’t know what he was doing, which is the opposite of my problem. He’s been really quiet to me since. I don’t know if I’m the asshole or understandable or what.","NAH. If he’s a chef then he probably knows what he’s doing, and his “overbearing” presence only seems that way to you because you don’t work in the type of environments he does. If him in the kitchen makes you feel that way then you just have to tell him that, and if he doesn’t accept it then that’s his problem.",0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for not telling my gf my parents passed down some of their wealth?. Throwaway. I come from a well off family from a small town. A lot of people there know my family.

I started calling her name to no avail. I looked around and found an older woman all alone.

Her roommate had guests over and there was no space, so I slept at her friend’s (B)’s dorm (2 nights). However, when A’s roommate’s guests left, I decided to stay one more night in B’s room partially because I was too lazy to move and partially because A and her roommate were sick.

"WIBTA if I told my cousin I wanted the basement suite room because I'm the daughter, and I've lived here longer?. Tl;dr"": my cousin wants one of the 2 basement suite rooms, instead of upstairs with my parents, shes lived here like a year and I've been living here getting the short end of the stick for 19 years now. WITBTA if I cited, among other reasons, that I've lived here longer and am the kid, and I should get it? 


Please excuse formatting. 

So my(19F) and my sisters(20F) cousin(22F) D moved into the house our parents and us rent around August last year and, while its a lot to get into, shes been kind of hard to live with


 Currently, in a 2 story house w/ unfinished basement, my parents have a room upstairs, and my cousin D and I are on either side of their room. This is hard for us, she thinks it is more so for her because shes lived on her own and likes freedom, but really it's as annoying for me as well. My sister A is downstairs in the unfinished basement, which shes gotten used to and doesn't want to give up. 


We've just gotten accepted to rent a new house, a 1 story w/ finished basement suite, with 2 rooms upstairs  and 2 downstairs, along with a second kitchen, bathroom, and living room. We've decided that, because shes the oldest sister and used to it(and stubborn so the fight wasnt even brought up) that A would get a basement room regardless. 


D thinks she should get the other room, citing that shes used to living on her own, and that sleeping next to my parents(her aunt/uncle) is difficult and she shouldn't have to because shes older than me. She and my sister also want the ability to bring boys over and not have to explain to my parents who/why there were there.

 Shes also said that if shes upstairs, then shes going to be working harder on moving out, and not staying as long, but I dont really know how long she planned to stay in the first place. 


I feel I should get the other basement room for many other reasons to:  I cook more than either of them, as well as bake and own a lot of kitchen stuff, and I'm more likely to clean the easily ignored things. I've got a boyfriend of 2 years who stays over while working sometimes, and would like the privacy. 

Now, onto the AITA  part. It sounds blunt, but I'm the actual daughter, I've lived here longer, I've gotten the smaller room in pretty much every house I've lived in so far, I don't think it's fair that she thinks shes more deserving of the freedom than I am. I dont want to say this, because I'm afraid shell be offended and I'll sound like an asshole 

D thinks that because I stay at my boyfriends house on average 4-6 scattered nights a month, and that I've got 2 jobs, that I'm ""never home"" and that being upstairs shouldn't matter to me.  

I think that, because I'm the daughter, I cook and use the kitchen more than her, as well as keep my space cleaner and more organized than her, that I should get the room in the basement suite. 



So, WITBA if I cited ""because I'm the actual daughter and I've gotten the short end of the stick too many times"" as one of my reasons for wanting a more private bedroom?",NAH - I think all of your reasons for calling “dibs” sound completely valid.  You get my vote!,0,0,0,1,0
"AITA for getting upset about my boyfriend and porn?. So a little back history of us.. My boyfriend and I have been together a few years now and have a son on the way. Sex has always been a touchy subject for me as right before we met, I was sexually assaulted. I’m incredibly grateful that he stuck it through while I dealt it when he could have made a run for the door after finding out. He was patient with me when I had any panic attacks or if I needed to stop when we were having sex. Because of all this we’ve always tried to be as open as possible with each other. 

When we started dating he told me about the kind of porn he likes to watch and how often he would watch it. It wasn’t a big deal, I thought it was normal. However lately I’ve been getting a little irritated at the fact that sometimes right after sex I’ll catch him watching videos or looking at pictures on his phone while he masturbates. He’s told me before that he does it when he’s bored or tired and even though I never really understood that it was okay. He will even watch it during breaks at work and stuff. It’s not like he’s ever hiding it, if I ask about it he’s completely open with me about it. So maybe I’m being extra sensitive since I’m pregnant but it’s starting to bother me now. We have sex a few times a week, mostly during the weekends since our schedules aren’t always in sync. 

He’s told me before he feels like his relationship with porn wasn’t always healthy because he was exposed to it at a very young age. His sex drive has always been a bit higher than mine, (I mentioned the assault earlier) so I try to be understanding as well. But now I’m starting to feel insecure like I was in the beginning of our relationship. Yesterday we had a long but enjoyable day and when we were settling down in bed together he tried to make a move but I was just so exhausted from the day that it was hard to get in the mood and he got a bit frustrated about it and we went to bed. Today, I felt better and we had sex and had breakfast afterwards. He said he wanted to lay down for a bit while I took care of some things around the house. About forty minutes later, I went inside the room and he shuffled around a bit.. I asked what he was doing and he said he was getting aroused looking at pictures of fit girls on Instagram and it hurt my feelings a bit and I told him that it upset me and I walked out. 

Am I being the asshole for just now starting to get angry at the fact that he’s looking at porn when it wasn’t a problem before? I feel like I don’t know what to think and that my emotions might be out of control because of the pregnancy.

I tell him firmly that I will not go, for the reason's I've already mentioned, and ask him why he can't go by himself. He says that he can, but that he would prefer to have someone with him. When asked why he simply responded that that's his preference. I told him again, that I'm not willing to go, and he stormed out, calling me an asshole/dick/etc. as he went. I'm fairly certain that my reasoning was sound, but I do feel a little bad because of his anxiety. AITA?

"AITA: Couldn't understand a customer's accent. This actually happened a while ago, but it's bothered me ever since.

I was 18 or 19 and had just moved to NYC and was working in a nice-ish clothing store in Manhattan. It was probably about a month after I started working there. A customer with a heavy Caribbean accent came up to the register with a belt and said, I thought, ""I want to retain this."" I thought maybe English wasn't his first language and he just didn't know the word for buy, but I asked him to repeat himself. He said the same thing again, so I started to check him out. He then repeated the same thing over and over again, growing frustrated, until finally I realized he said ""I want to return this."" 

Yeah. It had been a long shift.

He then got upset with me, raising his voice and telling me that ""I lived in New York"" and that ""I should be able to understand different accents."" He was clearly very hurt. I apologized profusely and processed his return. (I think I also told him I wasn't from New York and was new on the job). He thanked me and then left, still mad but calmer.

So, am I the asshole here? I wasn't trying to be a jerk, I just genuinely couldn't understand him, but maybe I handled it the wrong way.","NAH.

"AITA for displaying a memento of my addicted past?. I (26M) live in an apartment with my girlfriend Hailee (24F). I pay the rent, as she is finishing up her degree right now. Unfortunately, I was a drug addict from 15-24, and I moved from Xanax and Percs to eventually BTH. I was dealing with some abuse in my past, and I used substances to cope. When I used, i had this special spoon and lighter set. I threw the lighter away, but I ended up making the spoon into an Art piece that symbolized my recovery journey.

"AITA for wanting to kick out a band member who I live with. So for the past few years me and my roommate (who I will call Guitarist, because he plays guitar) have played in a band together. We didn’t know each other before being in a band together but have become close friends since then. A few months ago, Guitarist and I moved into a place together, as it was mutually beneficial for both of us and we both figured we’d make good roommates. 

Recently Guitarist has gotten more and more flaky about band commitments, including regularly missing band practices with flimsy excuses, missing shows and generally not showing any sort of interest or initiative about the band. Me and the other members have talked to him about this and expressed our concerns, but he insists he is still invested in the band. I have also noticed since moving in with him that Guitarist doesn’t to play guitar in his own time and has also been flakey about commitments to his other band.

During December last year we played some shows interstate that Guitarist was unable to make due to work commitments (which we completely understood). We had a couple of friends of the band fill-in for us, who did a great job and we had a lot of fun playing with them. Both of our friends have expressed interest in joining the band, and myself and the other members of the band agree they’d be a good fit. 

My issue is that at the end of the day I still think Guitarist is a great guy and I’m concerned about creating tension at home if we kick him out of the band. I’m torn between this and what’s best for the band, as myself and the other members have dedicated a lot of time and energy to it.

"AITA for trying to keep my dog?. (For record, this is a throwaway account, I’m not good at reading when I’m wrong and if I’m SUPER wrong I don’t want my main to suffer.) 

So, I’m not going to say my direct age, but let’s just say I’m old enough to use reddit but Im a minor and still live with the folks. I have a German Shepherd (that yes, I bought with my own money from my job) named Eli. 

Eli is a beautiful boy, he is eight months and has ears so big they haven’t stood yet. When I got him, I knew I’d have to be the sole one responsible. However, the breeder told us that a shepherd is a huge responsible that, while I would clean him and take the most care of him, my family would need to help. We had to sign a paper that said we agreed with his ‘terms’. 

Eli is so much bigger than when we got him, and he is a stubborn dog. I’ve taught him basic commands; sit, stay, down, down-stay, look, heel, and shake. He also works in dog agility classes so he can have his exercise. (Once again, aside from his food and *some* vet bills, I pay for everything.) however, what I’m not able to teach him is to not chew on the carpet, and to not bark when he is grumpy. 

My parents hate this, and I get it, carpet is expensive. I can’t pay for that out of pocket, but I’ve picked up extra chores so I can make up for it. But he’s damaged a good chunk of it so now my parents originally just wanted him to live outside, which I was completely against. (Mostly because he’s still a puppy) but, he was moved outside for a month anyway.

He was recently let back inside, and I’ve been working with him so so hard. But I can’t catch him in the act of chewing, so I can’t punish him for it. Now my parents want to get rid of him completely. 

I don’t want to get rid of my dog, now, if I wasn’t working with him constantly, I could understand why. But he’s just so stubborn and hard-headed. I need my family to work with him too, and they still said “Some dogs are just bad dogs. Even if we help, he’s still going to be a bad dog.” 

But he’s not a bad dog. I promise. He’s so good. I love him. He’s my buddy, and my best friend. But I can’t stop them. 

I don’t know, am I the Asshole here? Do I just not see if I’m being a brat? Am I being entitled? I need some help. 

TLDR: I’ve been working extremely hard with my GSD and I’m the only one working with him, but my parents want to give him away because he chews on the carpet.",NTA. You’re really trying. You’re a good kid.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for refusing to go to my stepcousins wedding in Hawaii because of my band and chorus concerts?. Hi guys, this is going to be a doozy, English isn't my first language but I'll try my best to be clear. 

So, my stepmom's niece is getting married in Hawaii this May. The issue is, the dates of the trip are over my chorus and band concert, with the actual wedding being on the date of my band concert. Also, we'd be getting back the day before I have to take my SAT's. 

Now, normally, the choice should be to go to Hawaii. But I told my family I can't go, because of these reasons. Her family and I don't get along, except for a few exceptions, they are all super judgemental and rude to me. Especially the bride and her mother (my stepmom's sister.) But it's Hawaii, right? I really hate beaches and hot climates, and don't get me wrong, I'm so thankful for the opportunity but it's genuinely someplace I wouldn't be happy in at all. 

Next, the real issue. I am very depressed, and what gets me through is my music. Missing these concerts means I couldn't be in any of my small ensembles for the rest of the school year. And this is what kills me. I'm lead chair in all of my band ensembles, and the lead soprano in my choir ensembles. It's something I work so hard for, and I can't stress this enough, at this current point in my life, I NEED these. Without them, I have absolutely nothing to look forward to throughout the week. It would absolutely KILL me to be without these. Music is my passion, my plan for the future, and if I couldn't be with them my depression would get so much worse. 

I just got into an argument with my dad and he called me selfish. I tried explaining everything to him (besides the fact I don't like her family) and he just brushed it off and made my emotions feel like they're stupid. He does this any time I bring up my depression, because he thinks mental diseases are stupid and fake. It really hurts because I can't get treatment, and my emotions get invalidated on top of that. 

The kicker, my stepmom said my dad didn't want to go. So I asked him why, and he said ""money."" So I told him ""My one happiness is less important than money. Who's the real selfish one?"" And left.

"AITA for being irritated by my neighbor's loud music?. This morning I woke up to loud music that I could hear pretty clearly from my apartment. I live on the third floor of my building and the walls are pretty thick so I don't usual hear anything from the neighboring apartments unless they get pretty loud. Regardless, I just assumed it was someone in the building and it was irritating but I didn't think much of it.

An hour or so later I went out to walk my dog and found the source of the noise was actually a man two or three buildings over who had set up two speakers and was playing his music at top volume. I live in the city and the buildings on my block are lined right up against each other so this actually wasn't much of a distance. Not shocking that I could hear it from my apartment given how loud it was. He was drinking something out of a red solo cup and shouting Happy New Year to everyone who walked by. When I passed him and he said it to me I ignored him, so he repeated himself and then I grumbled Happy New Year and kept walking because I was miffed about the loud music. He said something like ""Is it really that bad?"" but I ignored him and kept walking.

After I finished my dog's walk I felt kind of bad. I found the loud music very annoying but I guess he was just celebrating so I don't know if I was being unnecessarily snarky.

Im a 22f in retail, and I am the only one out of all my coworkers that communicate in Spanish, I’m not fluent but I’ve learned enough to keep my Spanish speaking customers happy and comfortable shopping in the store I work in.. My coworkers and I are ALL Latino (family’s coming from mexican heritage), and whenever a Spanish speaking customer comes in I usually take over and help them. 

Today a father and son duo came into the store and I go up to them to try and greet them and before I could even say anything the father stopped me by putting his hand out, says “no” and proceeds to wave me away. After that I left them alone, and helped out anyone that needed help. At one point I heard them trying to ask my coworkers for help but they don’t understand him and my coworker obviously doesn’t understand them. I go around helping out other customers and completely ignored the father son duo looking around not being able to talk to anyone else. They left the store and although what the father did was totally rude, I can’t help but feel I should’ve just gone back up to them and tried to help.

Basically, what the title says. One of my friends has been talking to this guy she met on a dating app for a few weeks now, and she seems to really like him a lot. At first when she began talking about him, I was supportive/excited for her. However, a few days ago she showed me a picture of him and it kinda shocked me. 

To put it bluntly, I have a...checkered past, and I used to buy H off this guy (I'm going on five years clean now). I remember back in the day he was an absolute scumbag - perhaps not surprising from a hard drug dealer. He treated any woman he was with like absolute shit. Of course, I know people change, and he may not be like that any more but I'm skeptical. I've asked around with old friends and they've confirmed he's still selling drugs. He's also the kind of guy who always comes across very charming at first and reveals his true colours later. Obviously, I don't want my friend getting mixed up with something like that. She's a couple years younger than me, and has confided in me before that she views me as an older brother figure.

"AITA for not apologizing?. Some background here, my mother has had a seriously rough childhood. She's a sweet, supportive, and strong woman that tries to break the cycle but sometimes verbal misuse slips out. She's not always a sensitive person but if you apologize for someone's actions or your own she typically says something along the lines of, ""It's okay, I'm used to people mistreating me."" She is a devout Christian and usually, her life revolves around the bible. My family isn't so much, especially me. My sister recently moved out and occasionally comes back to visit. My sister is in a same-sex relationship which she tries to keep secret from my mom. My mom knows but denies it. There's a wedge between them but they still try to get along. Since we were young my mother tried to get me to stray from my sister but she understands the things I go through at home. We bonded and became very close. 

My mom knows I keep my sister's private life private and doesn't like it. She tells me ""Your sister told me about what you said about me"" even though we wouldn't even mention our mom because we have no reason to. I tell her we don't after her prying and then she goes ""Actually she didn't say anything but I know you guys talk about me"" Whenever my sister comes over, my mom would accuse us of making weird faces behind her back. Or claims that my demeanor changes and I tease her whenever my sister is over.

Today we're all sitting at the table during breakfast and my family was talking about seeing a movie about Harriet Tubman. My mom sees me eating and starts going on about how I ""shouldn't shovel food in my mouth, not to eat like a pig, and to chew slower"" I kept eating the same way and she goes ""You're eating that way just to spite me!"" I finish my food and tell her that I'm not. So we continue about the movie and my mom says something about Harriet Tubman knowing about something in the bible and I say "" I wonder how if she didn't know how to read"" My mom starts frowning and says indignantly, "" Of course she did! It was passed down through generations!"" I almost shake my head saying, ""Okay, but why are you getting mad?"" She slams the laptop (that I bought her) and starts yelling and shaking more ""BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS OSTRACIZING AND TEASING ME WHEN YOUR SISTER IS HERE!!!"" and storms off. At this moment, my sister is disassociating and looking away from everyone. I go to my room and my sister goes to my mom's room.

 My sister goes into my room and I ask her if I did anything wrong, she says I didn't but it might just be some trauma she still deals with but I should still apologize. I told her that I won't because she has done this many times before and even if there's something she does, she'll know she's wrong but won't help me with certain things and throws it in my face until I apologize for being upset.

"AITA for ending my friendship with my sister’s best friend?. I’m a high schooler and part of the LGBTQ+ community.  I take it very seriously.  My sister and her best friend, M, are also gay and we were very joking about it.  My sister, M, my other sister and her husband, and I were all out at a college waiting to see a podcast show when I started joking saying that the LGBTQ+ help center for students we were standing in front of was for M.  She responded by saying that it was only “LGB” because she only believes in the “reasonable stuff.”  I was super mad because I have a Lot of trans friends and I take no shit from no one when it comes to this.  I immediately told M that we weren’t friends anymore.  She didn’t believe me at first but I kept telling her it was over and she believed me soon enough.  I didn’t talk to her for the rest of the trip.  On the ride home it was silent but M was texting my sister and I saw that M was saying I was immature and rude because I ended the friendship that quickly and because of political beliefs.  That didn’t help either because that mentality is not something I agree with either.  It made me not want to be friends with her even more.   I tell my mom, who never liked her but tolerated her, and she said I did the right thing.  Next, I get a string of texts from M saying that she valued our friendship and that she doesn’t “get it.” I did explain it to her before but she didn’t want to listen.  I didn’t respond to the texts.  I heard my sister talking to M later that day and M was yelling and cursing about it and I didn’t care to be honest.  The next day, she calls my mom and asks if she can speak to me in person about what’s going on and my mom said she can talk to me to arrange it.  M never did.  I haven’t talked to her since but I see her in the halls and she glares at me and sometimes shoulders me when I’m not walking with anyone. 

That’s not the only reason that was the breaking point.  M is very vulgar and frankly is just not my kind of person.

"AITA for asking my sister to babysit my kid so I could have sex?. I (20s, f) have a 3 year old daughter with my boyfriend. We both work full time, so when our daughter gets back from daycare we tend to spend all of our time with her, which we both love. We have a pretty active sex life (I think this is relevant to why my sister thinks I am TA), we do it probably four times a week. However, we haven't had a whole day to ourselves in a long time. My sister has been asking if she can have my daughter for a sleepover for ages, but we've never got round to it, because we always agreed that if we were having a weekend without our kid, we should plan something interesting to do that we wouldn't be able to do with her. This was something I'd told my sister, but she didn't say we have to do something cool for her to agree to have her niece. 

So, recently my boyfriend and I found a show we both wanted to go to. I asked my sister if she still wanted to have my daughter for a night, and she said yes. I didn't mention the show because it was just one of our favourite bands performing in a local bar so it wasn't that big of a deal. My bf and I have both had  stressful weeks at work, so we decided we would just chill out the next day. The show was on Friday, we got our daughter at around 7pm Saturday.

"AITA for ignoring my mother who married my former classmate?. When I was 12, my father passed away from a decade long on and off battle with brain cancer. I have three younger siblings, 2 sisters and a brother. Life sucked for the next few years after his death but our mother did an amazing job of raising all 4 kids on her own. 

Fast forward to high school, I had found a solid group of friends and we would often party at each other’s houses. It was never anything too hard, maybe a few beers, but never anything much more. My mom has always been super chill, so our get togethers were often held at my place.

Eventually, word got around that we had a spacious backyard and it became the hot spot for high school partying. People beyond my general friend group were showing up to our parties. It was at this point that my mother met ‘Adam’. Adam was always a year ahead of me in high school (he graduated in ‘15, I graduated in ‘16). I had spoken to him before on few occasions but only considered him a mutual acquaintance.

One night, he and my mom got into a deep conversation and they apparently exchanged phone numbers. He moved away after he graduated to attend university, but they continued to secretly text one another. One night, my mother confessed all of this to me and told me that Adam was planning to move back after his freshmen year of college so that he could be closer to her. He would transfer to a closer university and finish his degree there. 

A few months later, I graduated and moved out of state to attend university myself. Adam indeed moved back to be closer to my mother and they announced they were officially dating. I was just ready to get the hell away from home at this point and not have to deal with what I figured was going to be a ‘fuck buddy’ ordeal. 

Angry at my mother, I decided to stop talking to her once I moved away. I would ignore her phone calls and simply respond with a short text to assure her everything was good. Eventually, she stopped calling and the only time we would connect was through the occasional text message.

Two years later, Adam proposed to my mother. I keep in often touch with my younger siblings. They are now 18, 16, & 13 and keep me somewhat updated on their lives and our mothers relationship. They were all very disturbed by the relationship initially, but they’ve all seemed to have been brainwashed to jump on board with it. My sisters claim he’s a good guy who truly loves our mom. My brother is a bit more doubtful but he still seems to be generally accepting of it.

"AITA for not turning the light in my room off?. Alright, so for background we are both freshmen in college living in in a two person dorm room. Shortly into the summer, the roommate I had grouped up with on the housing application told me that he was changing his college, so he was gone. Then came my current roommate, who joined the room after I had already chosen it for about 2 months. On our housing profiles, we listed what time we go to bed at, my application says around 12 but sometime after. His profile says 11, which was ok, but by the time I realized the change happened, all other rooms were taken. Instead of 11, he goes to bed much closer to 10/10:30. As well as this, he keeps the lights in the room off no matter the time, as he stays in the room all day, except for classes. As a result, I have a smart light set up next to my bed so that I can turn it on at my leisure, as I like being able to see when I’m not sleeping, and it is in a directional desk lamp which is pointed only at my bed.

That still wasn’t enough for him, so l dimmed to the minimum brightness, where it should not be a major issue. However, he asked me to leave the room to go to the library, which is on the other side of campus, if I was going to want a light on.

He was a junior when I was a freshman, so he moved away several thousand miles after he graduated for a very lucrative position in CA. We still keep in touch and visit every month/every other month so in some ways it’s like he never left.

Anyways, when we first started hanging out Jesse gave me great advice on taking classes that interested me and choosing a career path accordingly - which was very influential in helping me decide what I want to do with my life. I viewed him as a mentor/older brother in this regard, and have a lot of respect for him.

Recently, however (ever since moving to his new job), he’s been using me as a sort of outlet to vent about things he’s going on with. At first I was happy to do so, as moving to a new place with entirely new people and places can be overwhelming. We would talk on the phone or sometimes in person for hours about how he’s either stressed, depressed, how he hates his body and can’t get girls, etc. It’s difficult to relate since he’s working his dream job getting paid well over 6 figures straight out of college while I’m finishing my senior year struggling to get by, but I do my best to understand.

This has persisted though, and gotten much worse. Recently, he complains to me constantly about how he can’t get in better shape “no matter how much he tries.” Keep in mind, he’s not obese or even that overweight, maybe 15-20lbs extra. I try to encourage him to eat healthier, since diet is much more important than exercise in terms of losing weight. Just the last time we hung out, he ate over half of a large pizza and then ice cream later that night, along with a few beers so it’s hard for me to sympathize since he’s literally doing it to himself (he doesn’t have an eating disorder, he can just be extremely gluttonous). 

On top of that, he vents about his family problems, of which there are many due to a very complicated dynamic. Now this is not an issue for me, because I don’t have a problem lending an ear to hear my friends out. My issue is that some of these family problems are wayyyy above my pay grade - and even Reddit’s for that matter - and should probably be resolved with a therapist/psychiatrist (basically him asking if he should permanently cut out certain family members). I also was fortunate enough to be raised in a stable family, so I have difficulty offering advice or relating to where he’s coming from, and have no idea what to tell him other than I empathize with his position.

WIBTA if I told him I have no problem offering support, but think he needs to see a licensed therapist or psychiatrist for these issues? I just don’t think I can reasonably help with his problems and that the complexity of his situation requires a professional.","NTA, sounds like your friend is unintentionally using you as his primary source of venting I wouldn't assume its malicious but is definitely something you should say especially if it's starting to drag you down, be chill say it straight and let your friend take ut how they want, if you believe they genuinely need someone to talk to maybe even offer a route but you can't be letting you be the only one, everyone has their own issues and yeah a problem shared is a problem halved but everyone also has their own load.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for yelling at my brother while he was on FaceTime with his friend and then snapping at his friend?. Title. I didn’t raise my voice or anything, but I was very obviously angry. 

Context:
We are (1/2) Middle Eastern and live in a fairly conservative area. His friend is white. (I’m not sure if that really matters.)

All the kids in my brother‘s friend group have an “edgy” sense of humor. (I do too, and I think most of the things they do are freakin hilarious. I just have limits as to what I think is appropriate.) They’ve all decided that playing the anthem of a well-known terrorist group (you can guess which one) is their new favorite joke. 

My mother (who is not middle eastern) has already told him to stop it on several occasions. She made it very clear that she does not think that this is something to joke about, but he doesn’t seem to understand why. 

I heard him playing it on the piano and laughing about it with his friend. (I can recognize it at this point because I’ve had to hear him play it so many times.)

I’m not gonna lie - I got really mad. I marched out there and I told him to stop. He just laughed and his friend mocked me. I told him to hang up the FaceTime so I could talk to him, but he refused. 

So I told him that he might think it was funny to joke about this, but it absolutely was not. This group tortures and kills people - it’s not funny. This group ruins lives and terrorizes innocent people every day. 

I kept telling him that it’s not funny, but his friend said “actually, it is kind of funny.” So I told  him to shut it and keep out of my family’s business. (I think that might have been an asshole move, I actually really like that kid. He’s a little bit insensitive at times and he has a habit of butting in to other people’s conversations, but he’s actually really cool.)

So I told my brother that people like his friend might be able to laugh and move on, but we don’t have that luxury. People already look at us like we might cause issues because of where we come from. I feel like we need to handle issues like this with extra care and sensitivity. (Even though I think EVERYONE should.)

My dad is really upset with my brother - he has to deal with discrimination all the time and he kind of feels like my brother is shitting on what he goes through. I’ve had a few incidents too, and I hope my brother never has to go through that.

I feel like maybe I should have waited for him to be off the phone but I don’t know if the conversation would have ever happened if I did. 

Do you guys think I’m the asshole? Could I have handled it better?",NTA- Oh the edge lords. Might be a good time to have your brother follow the rabbit hole down some of the photojournalism pieces about said terrorist org.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for constantly talking about flying to see my ldr bf?. My bf (22) and I (21) have always been long distance. We met once before when I was 17 and my family flew to Texas for a trucking conference or something. We spent a few hours together but nothing else. Those few hours became the happiest few hours in my life. Well my bf and I broke up and got back together a few times mainly due to the distance and just in general life. I'm the type that I need physical affection and I get really lonely to the point I actually get really depressed and it messes with other mental problems and self esteem. If I'm single I'm fine but in a relationship I'm not. I'm very vocal about wanting to see him again and spend time with him. I wouldn't say constantly but a lot. I even try planning it with him. 

My bf on the other hand doesn't seem to want to do anything towards this goal... He doesn't even let me plan it and he says it stresses him out because of things in his life? He works on a farm, he doesn't drive, he is either working, sleeping or gaming. While I know some other things have happened in his life, the bottom line is wouldn't he be happy to see me again?

I'm starting to doubt that he loves me and hes getting annoyed with me doubting him and bringing up planning to see him. I'm going to be going back to school soon to be an RN so I don't have much time left to travel to see him. And I just don't see any effort to make it happen. I just want to be a normal couple for a week. 

Am I the asshole?","NTA- sorry, but it doesn’t sound like he’s that into you. Either that or he has some serious anxiety issues and just doesn’t want to see you in person. It’s time to try dating a guy who wants to be available for you. You’re too young to settle for this",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for throwing out religious gifts?. My extended family is extremely religious, and tend to reflect this in their gifts. Bibles, cross/saint jewelry, rosaries, religious self help books, even large posters have been given to me for nearly every birthday/christmas/etc. I left the church years ago for my own reasons and they seem ok with it but I feel like these gifts are them trying to convert me, especially the books, often about ""finding a godly husband"" when I am a lesbian.

I dont bring it up and don't plan to, no need to make waves, but I'm doing spring cleaning and I want to throw out or donate this stuff. As Kondo would say it doesnt 'spark joy' and its taking up a lot of space. However, my mom insists I keep it, as my family would be hurt. Some of it is homemade, but that almost makes it feel more hurtful, like they put a LOT of effort into forcing their religion on me.

Am I the asshole for wanting to get rid of it?","NTA - gift/donate away and don't give it a second thought.  A true ""gift"" means the recipient can do what they want with it.  And if it wasn't a gift but an attempt to preach or manipulate then you absolutely should get rid of it.",0,0,0,0,1

"WIBTA if I let the groomer pay all $600 of my dog's vet bills?. This situation is still currently unfolding. I went to bring my 11 year old dog to the groomer's because she is getting very fluffy. The weather is getting hot and I can tell she is uncomfortable - even in air conditioning. I dropped her off at the groomer's at around 8:30am and got a call at around 11am. I have never been to this groomer but have heard nice things about her.

The phone call stated that she had tried to ""jump off"" the grooming table and cut her leg. They said she was very squirmy and would not stay on the table appropriately. I asked how bad it was and she said she's not sure how bad, but the groomer had rushed her to the local vet.  I assumed that it would be bad enough that she had to rush her to the vet.

On my way, I was fuming. I was fully prepared for a confrontation, because how on earth could this happen?  The way that they were saying she was ""squirmy"" indicated to me that they were going to try and weasel themselves out of this situation. I specifically told them to call me if she was being difficult in any way, as I was not too far away. I calmed myself down because I did not want to go into this situation with complete negativity. I was ready to hear the groomer out on her side of the story.

When I got there, she explained that the dog had backed up too far off of the grooming table and her back end slipped off. As she slipped, she cut her leg on the scissors that were laying down on the grooming table. The cut did not tear any tendons or ligaments and the prognosis was good. Although, the bill was $600.

The groomer was extremely nice and offered to pay the entire thing. Normally, I would offer to pay at least a portion of it. I have just gotten a new job, and have not gotten a real paycheck yet. Financially, I am not able to afford this bill because of the timing - so I just kept my mouth shut and did not offer to pay any portion of it. On top of this, the groomer was extremely nice and apologetic. I felt really bad! Accidents happen, and my mind switched from wanting to rip her a new one to completely sympathizing with her.

I am picking up my dog at around 5pm after she gets stitches and from there, they will charge the groomer's account for the expenses.

Would I be the asshole if I let her pay the entire bill? Should I offer to pay a portion of it? Should I send her money in the future when I am financially stable?

TL;DR: My dog got cut while at the groomers. The groomer was extremely nice and apologetic. She offered to pay the full $600 in vet bills and I did not offer to pay any portion of it. Would I be the asshole if I let her pay the entire thing?

&#x200B;

EDIT:  I failed to include a piece of information! The groomer is hired by a boarding kennel, and the owner of the business is not her. She is hired under another woman who, in my mind, would have to pay the expenses because it is her business. It seems to me that the groomer herself is paying it out of pocket.",NTA. they offered to pay for it. Let them.

"AITA for refusing to cut my swim short to let my forgetful roommate into the house?. I'm on a lovely caribbean island for a few weeks of vacation and scuba diving. When we arrived we each picked a room in the villa and were given keys to our room and the front and back doors. We were told that petty crime on the island is rampant and that if we left the doors unlocked we would very likely be robbed of our valuables. We each agreed to lock the doors to the house as well as the doors to our rooms when we left the villa even if we were just going for a swim in the sea out front.   


This evening we all left at around the same time, myself and roomate A to swim/snorkel in the sea and roommate B by himself to the pool. I locked the doors on my way out and stuck the key in my dry box that I clip to my swimsuit. I noticed that the door to his room was unlocked and thought I needed to make sure the front door was locked so that he wouldn't lose his expensive computer, phone, gadgets, etc. Every evening myself and roomate A swim a couple miles in the ocean along the coast. There are cliffs outside the house that run along the coast so we get in at a dock, swim parallel to the coast for a mile then turn around and swim back. It takes us a couple hours because we aren't in a rush and there is soo much to stop and look at along the way. Coral and tons of reef critters and fish. It's the highlight of my day. There really isn't a good place to stop and swim to shore because we're swimming along the cliff but the water is very protected, warm, calm and clear so there is no danger either. Just that it's impossible to get out of the water unless you swim all the way back to the dock.   


Roommate B forgot his key and was done swimming in the pool so he went back to the villa and when he realized he was locked out he walked along the coast till he found us (about 1/4 mile from the villa so we weren't close to the dock or close to the end of the swim) and started shouting and whistling to us. We were about 200 yards off shore so it was difficult to hear him and he shouted a lot before we noticed. When we did notice he said he didn't have his keys and that we should stop our swim and get out of the water and let him in. I thought ""fuck that"" and motioned for him to come to us if he wanted the keys. He declined so I put my face back in the water and carried on with my swim. He continued throwing a tantrum for another 10 minutes then left.   


Now, I knew he was safe, there is virtually no violence on the island, I knew he had access to help if he needed it, there is a resort just 50 yards down the shore that he could have called for help if it was an emergency, he had access to a bathroom (at the pool and at the resort), he had towels, it was a lovely evening, not cold, not hot. He wasn't at risk of a sunburn, the sun was setting and there was plenty of shade on the  patio of the villa, he had comfortable places to sit, there was even plenty of reading material for him on the patio. I knew that the worst that was going to happen to him was that he would be forced to sit on the lovely patio and watch the sun set till we got back. It's not like he was an unattended child, he's in his mid 50's. He is giving us the silent treatment now and skulking around the villa. We made dinner and he refused to eat and instead when down to the resort.   


Am I the asshole for refusing to cut short my favorite part of the day to go let him in? ","Nope...not the asshole. Lack of planning on his part, does not constitute an emergency on yours.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for freaking out on my mom for not signing my resume?. Context: I’m a 15m who lives in a decently sized city. My school offers students jobs as basically janitors. Just cleaning the halls and teachers rooms. I told my mother that I was going to apply for the job. She okayed it and that was it. 

Fast forward to when I got the application and filled it out as much as I could so all I needed was a signature from a parent. I told my mom that she needed to sign it and told that I also needed my social security and birth certificate. I let a day pass to give my mother plenty of time to sign it. I asked her and she said she didn’t  sign it. I also asked her if she had gotten my birth certificate and social security. She didn’t. I would’ve gotten my birth certificate and social security if I knew where they were at the time. I did ask my mother about this and she said that she would handle it. 
I waited for my mom to get everything sorted out. Nothing ever came of it so i asked my mother about it and turns out she forgot to do it. I never got the job because she didn’t get the resume signed or get me anything I needed for the job. 
Fast forward to about a week before Christmas my family was driving around looking at Christmas lights (my family is weird like that) and my younger sister was teasing me about how she was going to get a job before me. I said I would’ve had a job mom would signed the resume and get the things I needed. That led to a yelling fight about that when something important to me happens and i need things my mom just forgets but when important things happen to my sister, my mom either gets what she needs the day if, or the next day.

"AITA for using my phone on the bus?. I just read the post about eating pretzels in the bus & thought my story would fit with it.

I used the Bus everyday to get home from school. I often sat right beside the busdriver, because the bus is always very full & for some reason this place was always available. As everyone else I used my phone on the bus. 

But there is this one busdriver who called me out on using my phone on the bus. He said it was forbidden, but he couldn't say why. He just said it was forbidden & asked me if I couldn't read (There are signs that show what's forbitten in the bus. There is a picture with a phone and a ringtone sign) (I always have my Phone muted). I asked him why he was so angry at me. He just said he would kick me out if I would continue to use my phone.

I tried to not use my phone or stand in the back of the bus, but this seat was always free so someone had to sit there. So one day I had to sit there because he screamed through the whole bus, that standing in the bus was a safety hazard & that somebody had to use this place. Unfortunately the bus drive is pretty long & I had an email conversation with a company to make an appointment, because I wanted to work for them. 

The busdriver saw me using my phone & kicked me out of the bus in the middle of nowhere. I had to hitch-hike home. I called the bus company, but they didn't do anything against the busdriver because they didn't believe me.

Am I the asshole for using my phone on the bus? ","The sign OP described sounds like it's the same as the ones in my city.

"AITA for “hiding” my weight. Okay so I’m a bit of a chubby girl, mostly my upper legs and a bit of stomach fat. I tend to care about how I look so I make sure to highlight my good parts.


I recently got into a argument with my (male) friend who says that I shouldn’t hide my stomach fat cuz I would give guys the idea that I’m of normal weight. I however think this is bs cuz I don’t hide anything, I just dress well. I make sure not to highlight my stomach area and wear high waisted jeans with a nice belt to keep everything in place. I wear ankle boots with a small heel and wear natural looking makeup.


This isn’t really AITH but more of an is it wrong to dress like this? I don’t think that I’m really trying to give guys a wrong idea cuz if things end up getting somewhere, he’ll have to see my actual body so lying about that will only make things worse in the future idk


I often make jokes about how bad my physical condition is and how I’m bad at sports and stuff like that so nobody thinks that I’m “skinny”. Most of my friends just call me “thicc” cuz I don’t have a lot of stomach fat.

"AITA for asking my roommate to pay for an extra drink that got charged to my tab?. On Friday night, I went out with my roommate and some friends for a few drinks. At the end of the night, when we went to close our tabs, I noticed that there was an extra drink on my tab that I hadn't ordered. I immediately flagged down the waitress and asked her if I could have the drink taken off. However, as I was handing my credit card to the waitress, my roommate (who had not paid yet) says to me ""no, don't do that, I'll just have her take it off of my tab and I'll pay you for it!"" I asked the waitress if this would be easier for her and she said yes, so I agreed. 

The next day, my roommate tells me that she will not be paying for the drink, because the waitress had still charged her for her full tab. I tried to push back saying that she told me she would pay for it, but she wouldn't budge.

This morning, I texted her and asked her if she would please just pay me back for the drink, and that I was upset and confused as to why she suddenly refused to pay me just because she didn't check her own bill before we left.

"AITA for making my husband late for work?. Sorry about format I only have mobile.

I (39F) work 12 hour night shifts and my husband (43M) used to work the same shift but has recently been transfered to 12 hour day shifts as his plant closed on January 1st and he is part of the crew finishing everything up.  He's had a hard time with the plant closure as he loved his job and his career there has been going amazingly well.

It's been hard on us to be on opposite shifts so he has been trying to find times that he can see me. Yesterday he came home from work for his lunch so we could hang out which was great but I only got three hours of sleep before he woke me up and I couldn't back to sleep after he left.  I was exhausted at work all night.

Usually we text each other on breaks until he goes to bed at around ten but last night he texted me a couple of times really late with the last one at nearly 1am.  I was worried he was staying up late playing videogames which is something he does when he is stressed but it also means that he would be a real grump in the morning.

When I got home he was asleep and I thought I better let him sleep in some since he was awake too late.  I had a snack and sat on the couch playing on my phone and unfortunately I passed out hard and didn't wake up until 9:40am.  I hurriedly woke him up and he ripped my head off for making him late for work.  Then he lapsed into the silent treatment and dragged his feet getting out the door.  I made his coffee and packed his lunch really fast thinking he'd be in a rush but he took twice as long to get ready than usual and it felt like he was dragging things out.

"AITA for not for not forgiving a woman who bullied my mom for not being vegan?. About a year ago, my mom had a completely overbearing and totally extreme vegan couple who belittled and bullied her for months before she decided she'd had enough and cut them off. 

They weren't always so bad. They used to be pretty cool, and my mom was good friends with the wife for a while. When they moved in next door, they were cool. They would BBQ with us, ate meat at home, often shared recipes or meals with us if they thought we'd enjoy them, etc.

About two or three weeks later, the wife came to my mom's door and gave my mom a bunch of packages of chicken, beef, etc, and told her that her household was now strictly vegan and she didn't need them anymore. Mom was totally grateful because she no longer has to go to the store for meat, so she accepted and they chatted about the new lifestyle they'd adopted.

Fast forward to about six months later; the wife had been constantly bringing my mom down for not being vegan. Mom would come home from work exhausted and she'd be sitting on her porch vaping, and yell that if my mom would just go vegan, she'd have more energy after a nightshift. She would walk past our porch to get in her car or get the mail and yell things like ""Negative ten points to you for smoking!"" Or ""That's so disgusting, do you really have to keep doing that out here?""

She and her husband began a Facebook page with a following of maybe 100 people, mostly from their church, and began bashing non-vegans AND my parents in it. Talking about how she just wants to share her healthy new life with those she loves, but that she (and this is an exact quote) ""can't help those who let Satan keep control over them."" There were other details that specifically called out my parents by all but name, but I'm not trying to write a novel here. My dad jokingly shared a picture of a cow and a pig cuddling, and then another picture attached of a bacon cheeseburger that said ""Best friends forever."" She commented that my dad was a sick man and that she would pray for him. My mom told her that it was just a joke and it was kinda funny. She commented back something along the lines of them being horrible people and apparently her prayers would never help them. Mom blocked her. But dad didn't, and continued to share photos like that and tag me and my mom in them for WEEKS.

So fast forward to now; for some reason my mom and her began talking again. Mom told me I should be nice and add her on Facebook. But the woman blocked me over a year ago and I have no intention of adding her even if she does unblock me.

Mom is upset with me for still being angry, but there's a lot this woman said to her that was completely out of line that I will not forgive her for, INCLUDING that if we had put my grandmother (who died of a flesh eating bacteria and kidney failure from hospital negligence) on a vegan diet, she'd still be alive.

"AITA for refusing to give up our guns?. My fiancé - Jack,
Jacks brother - Gene,
Jacks grandad - Harvey,
Jacks mom - June,
Jacks step aunt - Deborah

I’m posting for my fiancé because he wants others opinions on it, but I’m gonna use my POV.

Backstory: Harvey raised Deborah as his own, but a few years ago after his wife (her mother) passed away, he noticed money was missing and it all pointed to Deborah. After that, he barely wanted anything to do with her. Harvey also raised Jack, who is his biological grandson.

Jack and I lived with Harvey. Jack lived with him since he was a child, and I’ve lived with him for 2 years. Harvey told Jack and Gene that they would get everything when he passed, and Deborah wouldn’t get anything. He never wrote a will though.

Harvey was a big hunter, he hunted for food, never for sport, and both Jack and Gene do the same. He was quite a gun collector too.

Deborah gave Jack an ultimatum, either cremate him and don’t give up any guns, or bury him and she would take a couple guns to sell. Of course he chose burial because that’s what Harvey wanted. She never said she was taking all of them, just a couple.

Now she’s saying she’s going to take all except two (one for Jack, one for Gene), and if he doesn’t give them up she’s going to send the government to our home and take everything that belonged to Harvey. Harvey would not have wanted his guns to be sold. He said many times that Jack and Gene would get them and make the decisions with them.

Deborah is also in a hole financially. She just had a $50,000 room built onto her house, but she and her husband make good money. 

Legally, since Deborah is his step child, she shouldn’t be entitled to anything (I think), and it would go to June. But nobody can get in contact with June, and last we heard, she was on our side with the situation.

Deborah and her husband seem to think we are being unfair, but Harvey’s wishes were that she didn’t get anything. This was not in writing though. We’re torn between what is the right thing to do, because we don’t know if she is actually using the funds for the funeral, or if she’s just doing the same thing she done with her mamas money.

We don’t mind selling a few guns to cover the costs, but she wants to sell them herself. We offered to sell them and take the money up to the funeral home but that was a no go. Our big issue is that we don’t want her using the money towards something else. We can’t explain that to her because then she’ll do something stupid like getting court involved when we’d rather that be our last resort.

"WIBTA if I put a note on my garbage can to ask people to stop using it for their dog bags?. We live on a road that a lot of people walk  and exercise on.  Tons of dog walkers pass by (and a few cat walkers) and something keeps happening on garbage day that is pissing me off.  

I put out the garbage can on the road and when I go bring it in a few hours later it's not actually empty because a few people have thrown their dog cleanup bags into the can post garbage truck.

Don't get me wrong, I love dogs.  We have a cat.  I gush over any pet I come into contact with.  But I don't want to smell dog shit every time I open my garbage can especially when I don't even own a dog!  This is actually a huge part of why we don't have a dog.  As far as I'm concerned, if you make the decision to own a dog you also make a decision to carry around their crap until you get home or until you see a PUBLIC garbage can.  

It's happened enough that I'm considering putting a note on the lid that just says, ""Please no dog cleanup bags"". 

To me this seemed like a no-brainer but my spouse thinks if I do this I will be asking for some neighborhood hate.  

So.  WIBTA?","NTA.

"WIBTA if I politely asked my new neighbours to not rev their motorbikes, or at least to only do it during the day?. We got new neighbours and I haven't really met them yet, but they're already proving to be a bit of an annoyance. I'm usually very lenient with noise stuff, I'm not the type of person who usually says anything unless it's really excessive. Like idgaf if you're partying and shit, go nuts. However I do have to draw a line somewhere.

These new neighbours have motorbikes which they constantly rev for no reason in their driveway. It's a huge issue because they do it for literally hours on end, usually after 10pm, often going as late as three in the morning. The reason this is such an issue is that it's sending my dogs absolutely mental so they're barking a lot, which means people are likely to file a noise complaint against us for the dogs. I've tried bringing them inside but they are still incredibly anxious because of how loud the noise is.

Another issue with it is that both me and my parents get up very early for work, so when they're doing it late at night it's impossible to sleep.

So, WIBTA if I just politely asked them to keep it down, at least after 10pm? We have mechenics as neighbours too and they manage to keep noise levels down after 10pm, so I don't see how the new neighbours can't. As far as I'm aware, they don't work during the day so I really don't see why they can't just do this at a more sensible time. Tbh I'm honestly surprised no one has filed a noise complaint yet because most people around here are the type of people who would do that",NTA at all.

"AITA for not going to wife's work event?. Throwaway. 

&#x200B;

My wife's work loves holding events, they do maybe 6/7 a year.Note my wife's workplace is 95% women (this is somewhat relevant)

&#x200B;

The events are usually pretty average. The way they do it is charge everyone $10 for coming, this covers a plate of food, a drink token and entry in a prize draw. The prizes are OK, cheap wine and gift cards, the food is OK, standard buffet stuff, after the free drink it's a pay bar which is pretty pricey. 

&#x200B;

The problem is that I hate my wife's colleagues, I hate their husbands and I hate the way my wife acts when she's with these people. 

&#x200B;

Here are some of the things that happened at the last event that finally pushed me into never wanting to go again.

&#x200B;

Wife and I were chatting to a colleague and the subject of children came up, we said we weren't quite ready yet, hopefully in about a year we'd be in the right situation. The colleague said ""Oh good, a new baby will have you exhausted but you've still got a year to train him to actually be able to handle the housework and help look after a child"" I honestly didn't know what to say to this so there was just an awkward silence. She then snapped at me ""Oh smile! Its only a joke"" 

&#x200B;

Talking to a husband at the bar; I ordered a soda while we were talking and he questioned why I wasn't drinking, I said I was driving that night so my wife could have a drink (taxi would be expensive as we live quite a way from the venue) He looked a bit shocked that I would forgo alcohol for the sake of my wife and I distinctly heard him call me a pussy as he left. 

&#x200B;

But the worst part was catching my wife and some of her colleagues making horrible remarks about other colleagues.Ones I remember were talking about a woman's 'gross, wobbly bits' that apparently her dress showed off, calling a woman in yellow a 'slutty bigbird' and just referring to 1 woman as the BFM (big, fat mess) I was stunned as it's so unlike her. When I brought it up afterwards she told me that just how it is in all women work environments and I didn't get it.

&#x200B;

There's an event at the end of the month and I told my wife that I didn't want to come this time. She was furious and said that I have to otherwise people will jump to conclusions about our marriage and shit talk her behind her back. I suggested her saying I was ill or had a family commitment but she insisted that this wouldn't matter people would still gossip. I asked her if she hated the idea of people talking behind her back, why did she do it to others? She just yelled at me that I can't understand what's it's like to work in the environment she does, this is just how it is and I'm an idiot.

&#x200B;

I'm stuck, I don't want to condone what she was doing, or put up with reductive stereotyping comments about men being useless with the house and kids or being a pussy for not drinking. But on the other hand maybe she's right and I just don't understand and this is something I just need to get over. AITA for not going?",NTA. Fuck those people,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for telling my dad that he is an inconsiderate person and an awful dad?.  

My (22F) dad (49M) is helping out this C (19F) who has always been very manipulative. C finished high school last year and has since blatantly refused to make an effort to get a job. She got offered a job a week ago b to do some admin work from home. However, C's parents does not have wifi, a printer or a scanner at their house so for the 100th time her problems becomes our problem.My dad told her that she can do her job from our house since we have all the stuff she needs.I use this stuff to study and my stepmom uses it to work from home.So he set up this closed-off area we have next to our pool for her as an office. This area is where I actually exercise daily but now I can’t anymore.I was not even informed of this decision and neither me nor my stepmom's rountines were considered. She is also not required to contribute to the wifi, printer ink, food and electricity she uses while she's here. My Stepmom is not happy about it, she doesn't like the girl either , but she has absolutely no backbone so she just agreed. 

He has always been overly keen on helping C out and never wants to do similar stuff for me and my sister. For instance, while he was setting up this office for C he was in the process of fixing my car so I can go write my test yesterday. He totally dropped that and I had to ask my boyfriend to drop me off and he got into trouble with his boss for being late. When C was learning to drive he would take her in his car (which neither me nor my stepmom are allowed to drive) EACH DAY and would disappear for hours on end. I think the longest time he disappeared for was like 4 hours or something. He told me I’m lying when I brought this up later.

There were many more of these situations but they were mainly just short inconveniences. But now this girl's laptop is apparently the place where our wifi connection goes to die and as a result I can't study properly and my stepmom can't work properly and my dad told me that I should just study at night when she's gone. I told him that I really struggle to study at night and I have to study at least 12 hours to get through what I need to so it won't work. He just shrugged it off. The last straw was when I wanted to start tanning by our pool because summer is approaching and C who hasn't been here the whole day decided to pitch up right at that moment so I couldn't. I didn't want her staring at me the whole time.

Everything just boiled up at that point. So I told him that he's inconsiderate and that his relationship with her has been very inappropriate with her (with regard to other things I haven't mentioned) and that I'm sick of it because he's been a crappy husband and dad. But he's one of those parents with a superiority complex where a child points out that they're in the wrong the child is automatically ungrateful and disrespectful. So I am feeling a little bit bad about the way I confronted my dad so I was wondering AITA? A couple of people have told me that I'm the one in the wrong.","You dad want have sex. NTA

"AITA for trying to shake a tailgater but ended up starting a road rage?. Yesterday I was driving an interstate in Central Illinois which is all farmland and open pastures. Nice and serene. Except for the guy who was tailgating me yesterday. Usually I’ll give them a few miles to exit or pass me, either way get off my ass. This guy was the exception. He was there for ten miles, and I noticed. He would swerve from the left side of our lane to the right side, even into the breakdown lane. He was getting impatient, and I saw it. I can only drive 58 mph; unless I hit cruise control, then I top out at 62 mph. This guy could’ve easily passed me if he really wanted to. 

So I back down from 62 to 58 and maintain that speed for a few exits. Still nothing. So then I go down to 55 and wait a few minutes. Still nothing. Then I go down to 50. He’s still on my ass. Even then everyone is passing us. Even had one trucker honk at me as he passed by. Finally a few miles pass and I hit the flashers and just let it coast. It’s been too long with this tailgater on my ass and he needs to pass me. 

Well, he passed me. At 70 mph. Just as I sped up, his 70 turned quickly into 40. Then 30. I pretended like I was going to pass him in the left lane, just as he got over as well. So here we are on the interstate both driving 30. He’s brake checking me every so often. I pull off at an exit and he cuts in front of me through the bit of grass. Brake checked me there. Pull up to a stop sign and he refuses to move. So I pull my brakes, get out, and pretend I’m on the phone with the police, reporting his tags and vehicle info. He flips me off and guns it back on the highway.

"AITA for refusing to apologize in this situation?. I made a comment about how someone's mom might be able to get a robot prosthetic arm after she told me that her mom shattered her shoulder & because of diabetes, might lose the limb. She thought this was insensitive and demanded an apology.

Background to the situation:  
I offered a new friend (as in, met once. Henceforth referred to as NF) a ride from a nearby transit station to the city (1hr drive). She couldn't make time because of her mom's injury and asked me to go out of my way to pick her up at her house. I agreed, because I could still make it to the city in time to visit my long distance SO before a concert me and NF were going to.  
NF was late. I got to her house before she did. She then had to pack up a bunch of makeup (she was the artist for one of the bands) and we left 45 minutes late. It was in this time that I made the above ""insensitive comment."" *She didn't say anything about her feelings at the time*. She went on to repeatedly ask if I would let her do my makeup (I don't wear that stuff) to warm up before she did the band's. I said no. She wouldn't let up, and neither would I. When we finally got there, I had less than 1hr to see my SO, which upset me as this was one of a few meetings we'd have for a couple weeks.  
Fast forward a few days later, I get a long series of texts explaining that although she thought I was making a joke, it hurt her feelings to the point that she almost asked me to leave without her. (screenshots can be posted in the comments upon request) She also said that she wanted to bring this up to me because she would rather settle it because it's ""not a big deal"" and it would be better than never talking to me again.   
I didn't, because I don't think my comment was insensitive and I'm not going to apologize to someone who effectively ruined my evening with her tardiness. I'd like to note that I hadn't brought up to her how annoyed I was about the situation because I understood that her being late was somewhat beyond her control. I eventually did when I explained why I didn't want to apologize.

  
Now she doesn't talk to me. Not a big deal, she was only a casual acquaintance. But I gotta ask... was I the asshole?",NTA. You were providing a solution to a problem.

"AITA for kicking out a boy when he came over for my sister. **names have been changed for privacy**
Apologies in advance for any mistakes

My little sister, Nicole (14), had a boy over tonight, Chase (17). This was the first time SHE had met him as he had DMed her on instagram. Nicole is an angsty girl who is self proclaimed as “mentally ill” for clout. I know there’s people with actual issues but trust me. She manipulates my mom to get whatever she could possibly want and gets away with things my parents beat me for when I was her age. She’s ultimately just a little piece of shit for the way she acts and treats everyone. She has little to no morals. 
My cousin, Gracie (17), and I had prior knowing of him as he has tried to get with her about 6 moths back and had tried for me when we were younger. He still has a SC streak with my cousin. I did not think about Chase or his name, almost positive it couldn’t have been the same guy because even though he’s a fuckboy, he’s my age. However, I was wrong.
 My mother left them both alone in the house while the rest of the family went next door for dinner. That’s red flag number one. I had gone before the rest of the family so I didn’t see him. Gracie asked my mom about him and flew out of her chair and over to the house when she heard who he was. I explained to my mom that he isn’t 15 and he wasn’t a sophomore like he AND my sister had claimed/ lied about. 
When we went into Nicole’s room, they were “wrestling” on the bed over a stuffed animal. He held the stuffed animal over his groin from thereon out if that says something. Gracie and I chewed this boy out and didn’t recognize we were the girls he tried to hook up with. Chase and Nicole both stayed quiet, knowing they fucked up. My mother pulled us off of the boy and made us go outside saying “you know she has a hard time making friends!” “They’re JUST friends” “you leave them alone” and insisting I’m just an asshole but this boy’s intentions were not that of “friends.” My mom was acting like nothing happened. 
After fighting with her, Gracie and I made my mother take home this boy a few hours sooner than what he was supposed to leave and tensions are high. Even if they are just friends, a Junior has no business hanging out with an 8th grader, A 17 year old has no business hanging out with a 14 year old. It’s just not right.

"AITA for Ignoring Fellow Volunteer?. This is my first time writing a post here, apologies for any mistakes made.

So I volunteer regularly at a center for underprivileged children and last Saturday, we took them to an attraction.  These children range between 5 and 8 years old, and there were 20 of them, with 4 of us volunteers.  It was all fine until we stopped for the children to snack.

After we found a spot suitable for the children to settle down, we herded 'our' children to the wash area so that they could wash their hands with soap and water before eating.  One of the volunteers seated her group at a table and called out to me to bring out my wet wipes so that the children's hands can be wiped.  I pointed out that we're all getting the children to wash their hands and she should just bring them over too.

When we returned to the seating area, her group of children had already started eating and another volunteer asked if she's gotten the children to clean their hands.  She replied, ""Well, since she (pointing to me) doesn't want to part with her wet wipes, I just allowed them to eat without wiping.  Anyway, I doubt they wash before eating at home anyway, so it's fine.""

Why am I the reason her group of children were eating with dirty hands?  There was a proper washing facility available which she refused to bring the children to.  If she wanted them to wipe their hands instead of washing, why didn't she bring her own wet wipes?  Also, it doesn't mean that we should encourage nor maintain the low standards of hygiene that the children might have at home.

Anyway, when we did the debrief with the center manager via our WhatsApp chat group, she brought up this 'issue' of volunteers not sharing resources which prompted me to wonder: am I the asshole?","NTA. you had no idea she was going to throw a mini pissy fit and let the kids eat without washing their hands, you assumed she’d bring the kids over just like everyone else.",0,0,0,0,1

"AITA for eating an box of chocolate?. So allow me to set the scene, one of my co-workers recently came back from the funeral of a family member and had brought back some chocos for everyone in the office.

Unbeknownst to me, one of these boxes was given to one of the contractors that works for us but, since he was not called back in (due to ether personal reasons or because the company did not call him in to work, is anyone’s guess) the box was left in the open on a desk used by the temps to put random stuff.

Now, you might be thinking “why did you take him box? Surely it had his name on it?” 

To that I say, no- there was no name on it and to add insult to injury- there were people leaving their boxes that they did not finish for other people to take if they liked leading to a Pavlovian response to hunt down any box that was not already claimed.

While all this is happening that box is left alone buried under a bunch of junk for weeks, fast forward to a couple of days ago- I was cleaning up around the office and found that box unopened.

Normally I would probably have taken it to the office kitchen and let it fend for itself but, my blood sugar was getting low and absent-mindedly ate some of it to stave my hunger.

A little after that the person confronts me about eating the chocolate, I admit that I ate it and that I did not know it was for the absent contractor and said I would pay out of my own pocket ($50 for a whole bundle since I could not get a single box) to replace the one box I ate.

She ended up berating me and saying that she was still upset despite my apology and my willingness to rectify my mistake.

"AITA for not giving in and apologizing?. Tha whole story started on saturday when I and a friend (L) realised we had to do a presentation for monday. We agreed to meet saturday at 3.30 p.m. On saturday evening she told me she had anouther appointment and couldn't make it until 5 p.m. at 4 p.m. she told me she couldn't make it until 6 p.m. I got kinda pissed at this point, because I wanted to habe that presentation finished at 8 p.m. So I asked her if we could meet up at my place instead of hers, so I could work a little for the presentation before we met so we would be finished earlier. She said that would be fine, but she would be a little late. I said that would be fine. Her home is only like 20 mins away from mine so I thought it she would be about 20 mins late. After she didn't show up after 45 mins I thought something might have happened to her and started calling her. She didn't pick up so I started to call other friends of ours and ask if they knew something. 7.02 p.m. she texted me she'd be there in 20 min. So in the end she was one and a half hour late and I was already pretty much finished. We worked anouther 20 mins and were finished (because I pretty much did all on my own). On monday morning I was sick and couldn't go to school. L talked with our teacher on monday and our teacher said we neesed to change something at our presentation. I asked her if she could fix this because I basically made the presentation on my own. She said that would be fine. I told her I would come back to school on tuesday since I started to feel better over the day, but monday evening I felt pretty bad again. I couldn't make it to school on tuesday, but forgot to tell L. 
On tuesday I started to feel better, so I went to my boyfriends place. After school L called me amd asked if I were at my moms or my dads place and I told her I was at my boyfriends place. She got angry at that ans I said she had send me a voicemail that explains why she is angry. The voicemail said she was angry because I didn't tell her that I wouldn't come to school and that she wanted to pick up the stick with our presentation on it because she couldn't open the email I send her with our presentation in it. That means, she didn't fix it on monday like she should have, otherwise she would have told me that the email didn't open on monday evening. She was now angry that 1. I wanted to rather meet at my place than hers after she relocated our appointment 3 and half an hour later 2. I didn't told her I would come to school that day 3. I wasn't home when she unannounced showed up and 4. I went to my boyfriends place when I felt better.
So now she is angry and I am angry (I think why is kinda obvious) and this might be tha argument that ends our frindship.

"AITA as my mom read my mean diary entry about her and won’t speak to me. I have a very loving family/good situation but my mom and I have always had a rocky relationship. We love each other but drive each other crazy and fight a lot (nothing violent or ugly). I keep a diary where I discuss very personal things and it helps me sort through my feelings and emotions. 

A few months ago we had a fight and I wrote a chapter about how difficult I find our relationship and sometimes I just can’t take it and that there are times where I don’t like her. I was really angry and upset so it was pretty emotional in the heat of the moment. 

We made up and everything was fine but a few days later, my mom suddenly starts acting strange. When I confront her about it she says she read my diary (says it was an accident but that’s impossible as I keep it under my pillow) and she can’t believe she awful things I said about her. She now hasn’t spoken to me in 2 months and wants me to apologise.

"AITA for telling a little girl she was being annoying?. This happened about 3 weeks ago, and I've thought about it enough times that now I want other opinions. A friend & I went to an anime convention in the beginning of December. He'd told me that he wants to line up super early Saturday to buy some exclusive thing, I say no problem. We stay out pretty late the night before & I was still hungover, so when 4am comes I tell him to go line up without me. Eventually I get up, shower, and as I'm leaving I find out my phone wasn't plugged in. I can't wait for a full charge so I just go. When I get to the convention center the line is wrapped around the building. I expected this, but now I have nothing to entertain myself with & nobody to talk to. I start browsing reddit but my phone is at 20% so I opt to save battery. As I'm putting it away, the girl behind me comments on the Pokemon pins on my backpack.

I've got a little under an hour before we're let in & nothing better to do. She looks about 10-12 & is there with her mum.

I glance up at mother who is starring some fierce daggers at me. I get it, she's not a fan of this interaction. I try to seem disinterested, one word answers with no follow ups etc. but this isn't dissuading her. Mother then puts her hand on daughter's shoulder then tells her that's enough, stop bothering the man. The girl brushes this off and says she isn't, then asks if she's annoying me. I hesitate, glance up at her mum, then back at her and say ""Yeah a little."" The crushed look on her face immediately made me feel like shit, followed by a her saying sorry.

Rachel and I were pretty good friends before the move but haven’t hung out much since she started to date someone that we both used to work with (they still work together).

"AITA for not letting my roommate use the dishwasher?. We have been living for a couple months now and my roommate is very frugal and does whatever he can to save some extra money. No problem. Recently he decided to no longer use the dishwasher, and only hand wash dishes to save money on the utilities bill. I’m kind of lazy and love the convenience of using the dish washer so I wasn’t willing to budge. To make things fair we settled on that I would continue to use the dishwasher but I would pay extra on the utilities bill instead of the originally agreed upon 50/50 split. I don’t have a whole lot of dishes so I run out pretty quickly and have to run the dishwasher about twice a week. I was totally cool with this until recently he tries to throw some of his dishes in with mine every other load or so since there’s “plenty of room for his dishes”. He gets upset at me and says that I’m unreasonable whenever I take his dishes out before running the dishwasher. He thinks he should still be able to use the dishwasher every once in a while even though I’m paying for most of the utilities now.

"AITA for not wanting to spare feelings?. My mom wanted to assist in my wedding planning but when it came to the invites it got a little messy. My [21F] mom [51F] wanted to invite her Aunt [70F] and Uncle [70M] (my great aunt and uncle) to the wedding without telling me. She did a lot without telling me or asking me, including the “theme” of the wedding or where we went to eat afterwards. That was another issue though, just wanted to give insight to the situation.

It’s not that I hate my family, I don’t necessarily care for them in particular because of how they have treated her in the past and how they are very rude/passive aggressive to everyone they pretend to tolerate. On top of that, my great aunt likes to gossip/spread rumors and never keeps her mouth shut, which is the main reason why I can’t stand her especially, out of the two.

My mom brought it to my attention a few days before the wedding that our Aunt and Uncle would get mad if they weren’t invited and they they at least needed to know. I was slightly surprised that I even needed to tell someone that they couldn’t go, due to the fact that they weren’t on the list of very specific invites I gave my mom in the first place. She just decided to do whatever she wanted and let anyone know she felt necessary without regard for my private list.

Unfortunately, my now-husband and I already got married on the 31st of August. My mom seemed frustrated that I didn’t want them at the ceremony nor the reception. She told me that I’d have to tell them and that it was my responsibility to do so when I never even wanted them to know OR go, in the first place. She won’t admit it to my face that she invited them without telling me but thankfully, they didn’t show up. 

Now here’s the part that bothers me the most. I wanted to post my wedding photos on Facebook (that I only have to see how all my family is doing) for other family members to see. My mom insists that we wait until November (she planned a Vegas trip for my husband and I as a gift) to tell anyone/everyone that I got married and make it seem as if we got married in Vegas, again trying to control everything. 

I don’t want to change the history - MY HISTORY,  of how I got married just to spare the feelings of two people who never cared to know me or see me in my life. I feel as though I should be able to post/share/exclaim to the world that I got married and it’s pretty bullshit that she is trying to control everything. What should I do Reddit? AITA?

"AITA for not wanting to have sex at the drop of a hat?. I guess I should preface this with some info. I (20F) have been with my husband (21M) for several years. We got married last summer and live together at university. 

We had a healthy sex life pre-marriage, but recently I haven’t been as into it (I don’t know why). My husband is always into it, and it feels like even minor flirting with him will end up as sex. I try to fake it for him, because I really do love him, but it makes me sad, and sometimes he catches on and gets upset. When I deny him outright (like he has told me to do), he goes and isolates himself, sometimes for hours. Lately he seems less into me, and I’m so scared. 

We’ve talked about this quite a bit, and it usually ends with a decision for me to try and increase my libido. I really do try, and he says he understands, but it’s like he wants sex every night, and either I give it to him or we have a long conversation into the night and I’m almost too tired for class the next morning. 

This is starting to affect my schoolwork and our marriage and I just don’t know what to do. I feel like it has something to do with his untreated depression and I always feel awful for not wanting to always have sex, because he spirals into an awful depressive fit more often than not. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: my sex drive is low, my husband gets upset and standoffish because of it, I feel obligated to fake it for him, and it’s starting to affect my schoolwork and our marriage","NTA, but I think some things need to be said.

1) You don't need to go around getting treatments to ""increase your libido"" just because your husband is sad.

So my brothers as well as a male cousin chipped in to get our cousin an Amazon gift card - she had recently given birth so we wanted to get her something.

"AITA for refusing to give my mother my tax papers?. I'm 24 and go to school FT and work PT. I do pay my mother $300 in rent/utilities. This is new.

She does not pay for any of my bills. I pay for my own tuition, books, food, gas, car insurance, etc. This is not new.

My younger brother also lives with us (19) and just works BUT does not pay any rent. In fact my mother gives him money. It's like any money I give my mother goes directly to my other siblings and it's a point of contention. To make matters worse, she not only lies about my brother paying rent and not giving him money.

My mother discreetly dropped me off her work insurance plan. I only found out when I called her job up to get a new health insurance card and they told me that I was no longer on the plan anymore. That actually hurt that she did that. She is under financial stress right now because she is also supporting my loser sister, her baby daddy and they just had a kid.

In the past, I would give her T-1098 which is the tax form for college. It was of no value to me because I was listed as a dependent (which was required to get health insurance under her job). Basically she would say that she paid for all of my tuition and books so she could get a bigger refund and more credits on her tax return even though I was the one who personally paid for all of my college expenses.

She asked me for my T-1098 from 2019 and I refused to give it to her. Since she kicked me off her insurance because she couldn't afford it (and didn't bother telling she did that), I am now deemed an independent and I am filing my taxes as such. She blew up at me saying that things are financially tight and tried modifying our rental agreement to where she would claim my college expenses as her own. I won't budge. I would actually get a big enough refund to cover next semester's tuition.

RF has so far quit two jobs within two weeks of having them and is no longer looking for work. Everyday when I come home I find the kitchen and living room are a mess and our trash can is overflowing because RF doesn't clean after himself, and I know it's his mess because he is by himself at the apartment as me and RM work full time jobs.

"AITA for exposing my cheating friend?. I (F28) found myself in the middle of 2 of my friends, engaged to be married towards the end of this year, (M32) and (F27), in their cheating scandal. We'll call them Barbie & Ken.

I have been friends with Barbie since we were about 16, not close but we'd party together every now and then. I met Ken through her when they first started dating about 7 years ago.

Beginning of this year their relationship became rocky and Barbie started acting out when we'd go out without Ken. All she wanted was male attention, which I didn't see as much of a problem at first as it seemed to be harmless drunk flirting. She later confessed to me that she had been cheating on him and took home a few dudes from the bar when Ken was out of town on work trips. 

I asked her if she was going to tell him, she said no and that she didn't feel guilty because he deserved it for paying too much attention to work and not enough to her. I told her they were going to be married soon she needed to be honest with him and I didn't think what she was doing was cool. She cheated on him a few more times, then they started fixing their issues and she began to regret it, but still didn't tell him.

Fast forward to 2 weekends ago. They have a party at their place, and Barbie secretly invites a dude over that she had cheated with. Long story short, a different friend of ours caught them fooling around and told Ken. Ken was pissed and Barbie left with the dude to 'some other party', and kept lying to Ken about it all night trying to say I was involved in some way (I think she said it was my friend's party and I was meeting them there).

I go home, text Ken to see if he was okay and offered my guest room if he wanted a place to crash if shit got worse. He comes over, has full breakdown, and begs me to tell him if she's fucked someone. I tell him that I didn't want to get in between them, and he asks again and I cave not wanting to lie. I didn't give any details, just vague info of about when it started happening. He tells me he also cheated around the same time!

I tell him they clearly have shit to sort out before getting married, and he leaves to a buddy's house.

Next morning I awake to an extreme rage from Barbie. She is furious that I told him anything and calls me a slew of names and tells me I'm a shitty friend and it was out of line, and if she thought he should know then she would've told him.

I thought this would be perfect and asked aunt3 if we could move grandma and I to it and I would pay her my portion. She agreed. This was about a year and a half ago.

Well a few months in Aunt3 decided this was too much of a hassle so she decided I should just pay for it all. I was annoyed but sure whatever fine. I paid our full $70 dollar bill for a few months.

"AITA for not replacing my roommates items with upgraded versions? -. So, for backstory, our roommate has very rarely been here since the first few weeks of August. During those first few weeks she adopted a cat from someone a few hours away who was abusing him. When he arrived at our house he was covered in mats and terrified. In this same week, RM's boyfriend got a house and she suddenly stopped being home for days at a time.

The cat pissed in one of her chairs, and one of our chairs within the first few days. My girlfriend and I dealt with it. Just continued to feed him and took it upon ourselves to shave him. He was much happier after that, but honestly still hated people. We told RM if we were going to take care of the cat all year, we should take the cat with us at the end of lease. She agreed to this.

In October, shortly after our boyfriend moved in, we realized the cat had peed on her futon. We threw about the pad, but I remembered her saying something about finding this on the side of the road, and the pad was already semi-gross so we kept it covered when we used it (broke college students amiright). We threw it out and started searching for a new used one. After I week, I gave in and texted her I was just going to buy a new futon pad for the frame so we would have something to sit on instead of an empty frame as the center piece of a living room. I ended up spending $200 on the pad for a new quality one.

After about another month, we are trying new techniques to help get the cat to get along with our other cats. This seemed to piss him off, and he decided to piss right on the center of our mattress. GREAT! So we throw it away, and decide that we should probably check our roommates bed since she leaves her door open when she leaves. We find that he seemed to have been pissing on it for awhile now, and the entire bottom half of her mattress pad (\~$57) was covered and her comforter (\~$20 & a few years old). We threw it away for her, since the smell was unbearable. We texted her and let her know what had happened, and RM immediately texted back links of a $170 dollar mattress pad and $80 extra plush comforter... We refused to buy those things since clearly we don't have that money to drop out of nowhere for upgrades of what was really her cats damages.. She says that isn't fair that we are picking and choosing what we will and not replace based on whats convenient for us, which we respond we don't understand what shes talking about, we haven't replaced anything for her to have. She freaks out, comes home and gather some of her things, and says after December she is moving in with her boyfriend. We had been expecting this for awhile so it was fine by us. She also got mad that we threw her things away, and since we had bagged them we went down to the dumpster and pulled it back out and put it in her room. We also decided to move our futon pad onto our boxspring since we can't currently afford a nice mattress, so it will do for now.

RM came home a week later and acted weirdly nice.. it put me on edge. The first thing she asked me was where the futon pad was, which I replied we were sleeping on it for now. RM said she agreed that the mattress pad that we put back in her room was too ruined and so was the blanket, but for some reason only threw the blanket away. She didn't really grab anything, just left and said she had to run errands.

I told my girlfriend and boyfriend that we should put a lock on our bedroom door, since we tend to keep our money in cash and have other valuables. We do it immediately after I recommended it. Very shortly after we get a text asking why we locked her mattress pad in our room. We were home at the time, and didn't know she had even been home, and so were very off-put that she would let herself in our room. Especially since I have heard her tell stories of stealing from people who she feels like owes her.

Suddenly, after refusing to answer our text about when she will be by to get her stuff, RM shows up at 7am with her boyfriend and 2 strangers. They are throwing things around and generally treating my home and belongings with disrespect. They leave the door wide open while doing this, even though we have 2 cats now (we got rid of the one that destroyed our mattress - sorry kitty). I don't want to bother them so we all leave ourselves locked in our room. Suddenly she pounds on the door, and I come out and she tells me shes going to call the cops if I don't give her the futon pad. I explain calmly that I have a receipt, so she can call the cops but they aren't going to do anything. I attempted offer to help buy her a new used one, but she insisted she needed the brand new one we are currently sleeping on. I give up and go back in my room.

About ten minutes later the cops come. I show them the receipt and tell them whats going on. They stay there until she gathers her stuff. In the meantime I realize my cat has went missing and RM and those she was with snickered while we walked around searching for her. She eventually got her stuff all out, but she was pissed when the cops told her the futon pad wasn't hers and she wasn't allowed back on the property.

We found the cat terrified in the back of the cabinet. All the people slamming stuff around spooked her. What an eventful morning.","NTA, she took in the cat and basically let it fend for itself.

This roommate isn’t very respectful towards us in that he’ll often go to the toilet and not clean out the bowl after himself, he also coughs and sneezes but doesn’t cover his mouth, he doesn’t clean up after himself and generally shows little respect towards us. 


My girlfriend said she knows that her actions were wrong but feels justified in doing so because of the way the roommate acts and says respect is earned, not given. That she’ll treat him like an animal if he carries on like one and that she treats others how they treat her. 


I told her of the old quote “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” and that regardless of how you feel for someone, you should never do something like that. A toothbrush is one of those sacred things you never touch. Everyone deserves to be treated with some respect regardless and that it wasn’t okay. Everyone is human and they deserve to be treated as such. 


She called me an asshole, said I was trying to make myself feel good about myself by taking the moral high ground and that I shouldn’t be making her feel so bad about it giving that this whole argument is over our disgusting roommate. 


At this point she went on the attack and told me she doesn’t know if she wants to be with someone who doesn’t like all sides to her. She feels she might be letting herself down because she’s with someone who doesn’t like that side to her. I obviously told her that she was being ridiculous and that she was obviously just saying this because she was upset and couldn’t accept that I was unhappy with her. 


She said it wasn’t right for me to say I “don’t like that side of her” and it made her feel as though I was going to leave her. That it made her feel as though I was saying it was a deal breaker to me. I agreed on that point and told her it was poor communication on my part as this clearly isn’t some defining characteristic of hers and that I just think this act was in bad taste and that it would be cool if she’d just agree to not do it again seeing as she agreed that it was wrong of her. She then doubled down and said she’d do it again and that he’s lucky she hasn’t scrubbed the toilet bowl with it. 


She says she feels very strongly about this because he’s made her feel so disgusted given that she’s always having to clean up after him, a stranger, who shows us no respect. 


So AITA?",NTA. How utterly unsanitary to use someone else's toothbrush to clean up her phlegm. And childish to do this out of spite. Have you brought up the respect issue with your roommate? They may not realise they're being disrespectful. If you have and they have made no effort to change then ESH but your girlfriend FAR more so.

"AITA for telling my ex that I don't care about her?. Recently me and my now ex broke up because I found out she was cheating on me with multiple people. Since then she would call me and text me asking for me to forgive her and I would just ignore the calls/texts.

Well yesterday she stopped me at school and asked if I hated her. I said no (I was lying). She asked if we could talk. I said no again and went to walk away. She got in front of me again and asked why not. So I responded with, ""I don't hate you because I don't care enough about you to hate you, nor do I care enough about you to give you the time of day. And just in case I am not being clear enough I care so little about you that you could get hit by a bus right in front of me and I would just keep walking."" 

This is again a lie, as I cared enough to come up with and practice this speech in my head in preparation to this inevitable confrontation. But all the same it felt amazing to say.

"AITA for not telling my GF that my ex works with me?. My GF of 5 1/2 years is super protective of me because I am pregnant and because she is worried I will leave her for someone half her age.

Currently, I work in admin  for a private school which I love. I'm now helping our year six students and their families transition from our primary school to our high school.   It's excellent work, and my girlfriend understands entirely if I come home from work and don't feel particularly sexy on date nights.

My girlfriend ( Sara) and I have a great relationship; I get along very well with her ex-husband for the sake of their kids and she gets along with my BFF who is gay and the father of my twins. Sara has met a few of my ex-girlfriends by accident when we have been out and about. She's not stupid, and she knows that I have dated other women before her (none can compare to her).  We love and trust each other enough to know that we are happy and know that we are loved.

The issue started when one of my team members got another job overseas where her husband is working at the moment. Without thinking anything of it, I wished her well and put out an advertisement on multiple job sites looking for someone to replace her.  I  didn't end up interviewing anyone because Sara  had a nasty motorbike accident where she broke her leg.

Coming back from leave, I was about four months pregnant at the time, and I was showing. Walking into my office, I was greeted at my door by the Deputy Principal and someone whom I would rather forget. The new person was my ex-girlfriend (Zoey). Zoey is the girl who I was with before Sara, whom I refuse to talk about. I don't speak about Zoey is that she made me choose between my twins and her. I wasn't going to leave my kids, who at the time had chickenpox so she could go to Thailand (yes they had their dads, but that's not the point). So I sent her packing and never spoke to her again.

I haven't bothered mentioning it to Sara   because  my relationship with Zoey is in the past and I have nothing expect work to tie me to her.  Sara she has just turned 40 and because I've just turned 29, she is feeling a bit self-conscious about herself. because she is older than me and she is  is starting to get wrinkles. I have told her a million times that  I adore her,  whenever she walks into the room I always stop and stare, even if she is in her work out gear and sweating like a pig.

Right now I am doing everything humanly possible to avoid talking about the new girl at work.  I am cooking Sara her favourite meals, taking her out shopping, taking her to spas.  For NY I booked a hotel room for two weeks so I could show her how much she meant to me without the young kids (my twins) or the teenagers (her boys and girl) Basically doing whatever I did to win her over in the first place.

"AITA for not wanting to receive bible verses from my mother?. Mandatory ""first post, long time lurker"". Sorry about the long post - just wanted to add some info.

I just got back after spending a long weekend with my parentals at their home. They raised me to be Christian, but I've been an atheist for the last 10 years. My parents know this and we've got this unsaid agreement that I won't blaspheme and they won't try to convert me.

My dad respects this and though my mom insists  I pray with them when we sit down for a meal, she tends to just leave me be as long as I'm respectful (which I ALWAYS try to be). However, my mom has started emailing me scripture. I've asked her not to do this. Repeatedly. Politely. She still does it, but now she just starts it with ""You don't have to read it if you don't want to"". After the last ""verse a day"" that she forwarded to me I told her that she is not respecting my religion (or lack of one) and that it upsets me. This time it was not just the fact that she sent me scripture but the message that she sent with it - That God tests us to make us stronger and that if we believe enough he will save children/women who are being hurt.

I live in South Africa and that last email from her was after news broke that a university student was brutally murdered in a post office close to where I live. Everyone around me and on social media was outraged. There were huge protests against gender violence. I was glad that people were standing up against these horrible things, but it did trigger my PTSD. I was feeling unsafe and I was having nightmares about how I was attacked etc by a man when I was in high school. Thus, when I replied to my mother's last email I was not as friendly as I usually am. I told her that starting the email with a disclaimer stating that it was my choice to read it didn't make it any less disrespectful. I told her that the message in her email angered me. And I told her that, next time, I will be sending her my favourite scripture which will include all the terrible things God has done (like killing babies etc).

Next followed one of my mother's infamous silent treatments. I didn't hear from her for 2 weeks. She ignored my calls. Then she just started talking to me again out of the blue. This all happened a few weeks ago.

Today my mom makes this comment how, though she has her moral values and religion, she won't ever force it on someone else. I then ask her why she is sending me scripture if she doesn't want to force her religion on me? She then goes on a tirade on how I'm a terrible child who sent her such a crass email at work that made her cry after she had such a terrible week and that she was trying to send me a positive message. I then told her that she could have avoided all this if she had not sent me scripture in the first place. She refuses to stop sending me these emails.

Was I TA in this situation? Should I just let her send me these emails so she doesn't get upset?","NTA, send her flying spaghetti monster scripture as a reply.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for not wanting my roommate's boyfriend over when I'm there?.  

kay, so my roommate and I  go to a small college. Our dorm room is pretty small, and it’s just the two of us. We have been roommates only for a year, and other than me preferring to not have her boyfriend over, everything is fine.

My roommate likes to go to his house on the weekends, so I’m usually by myself and I have my boyfriend over. Her and my boyfriend are friends, but he’s around a lot because he goes to school with us.

Now, I ALWAYS ask if my boyfriend can stay with us (if he ever does when she’s here) and she always says yes. If she ever says no, I go to his room and hang out there. The main issue is, she NEVER asks if he can come. She just says “boyfriend is coming up this weekend.” And if I say anything she pulls the “your boyfriend is always over” card and I drop it because she’s right.

But here are some issues I have had with her boyfriend that make me uncomfortable with him being around: -he treats her terribly. He constantly insults her. If she does her makeup he says she looks like a clown. If she wears overalls, he says she looks like a “yeehaw minion”. Striped shirts = boy in the striped pajamas. If she wears a choker necklace = 4 hour screaming match on the phone or in person about how she’s a whore. If he’s in a bad mood, he picks fights over anything and spends hours insulting her for any reason he feels like.

\-he has told her multiple times on occasion that he thinks I’m really sexy and wants to fuck me. She always gets upset, for obvious reasons, then he tells her that it’s normal to be attracted to other people. He then lists off every one of her friends that he finds attractive.

\-he has tried, on many occasions, to try and force her into a threesome, something she has told him multiple times she never wants to do. He then asks her “well what if the third person was roommate, or friend""

\-When he comes up, they are constantly high. Now, I don’t care if someone smokes weed. I’ve tried it before, not my thing, but if you like it, you like it. My issue is that strong smells, particularly smoke smells, make me feel incredibly nauseous and give me migraines so bad that I can’t move from my bed. If they aired themselves out I wouldn’t care, but they don’t. The smell is so bad because our room is so small.

\-He gives me just a creepy vibe. I can’t explain it.

\-obviously, they wanna do sexy things, but if I’m here on the weekends, there’s nothing to do. But I’ll leave for a little bit. I’ll come back after a couple of hours and still be locked out of my room because they’ll have had sex, left, gotten high, and went back at it again. I could be locked out of my room for 5-6 hours at a time because of this.

\-He only ever seems to come up on weekends I cannot leave or cannot stay in my boyfriends room because he has left.

I know there’s a lot here, and I will accept asshole status if that is what has been deemed necessary, but AITA?","NTA

"AITA for reporting a pregnant professor with a newborn for academic misconduct.. So some background,

I'm a Bio major in the second semester of my senior year, i.e about to graduate. A year ago I took a course with a professor and didn't do great, I ended up getting a D but money/time constraints made it so I didn't have the option of retaking the course for a better grade so I sucked it up and vowed to do better.

Flash forward a year and I've heard nothing but vitriole regarding this professor including a student doing research with her claiming that she told that student to make up data in order to get the desired results (a really big no-no for any scientist).

Through all of that I kind of shrugged cause people make stupid claims all the time and even if me and the professor didn't like each other, that doesn't mean they're bad. Eventually I checked my grades and they totalled out to a 79% in the course, while not an A, that's definitely not a D, but I still disregarded it, assuming there was something I was missing. 

Long story short, I met a student who literally failed 3 of 4 exams and scraped by on the final but still got a B+ in the course, I filed a complaint last week because I did better than that student but received a worse grade. 

Here's where I'm in a dilemma, when I took the course the professor was pregnant, and has since gotten pregnant again. Normally this wouldn't phase me because hey, just cause you're pregnant doesn't mean you're allowed to choose who you like to succeed, but the other day I heard that same professor talking about how she couldn't afford to support her kid(s) without this job and how grateful she was for it. 

So like, I don't think I've done something unwarranted, but that doesn't mean I'm not an asshole. I have no desire to see parents or kids struggling, and the fact that I'm about to graduate somehow makes it feel worse.","NTA

"AITA for telling my girlfriend to take care od basic hygine?. My girlfriend has mental disorders and, because of them, finds it hard to take care of basic hygiene. Things like brushing her teeth, taking a shower, taking meds, and doing physical therapy stretches for her multiple stress injuries.

It's gotten to the point where, as of today, she has not showered in over a week, brushed her teeth only once during the same time (despite getting a molar pulled due to neglect), and can't lift anything more than a pound.

Am I the asshole for repeatedly reminding her to take care of herself since she won't?","You’re not an asshole.

Or we’ll even shower together to get my brain more willing. By not asking or reminding me, he’s silently saying “you’re an adult and you need to be responsible” while also supporting me through action. Maybe she would benefit from the same type of support?

"WIBTA if I ignore my ex’s calls from rehab?. WIBTA if I ignore my ex’s calls from rehab?

Story time:

We started talking about two years ago, dated for about a year when I broke things off in June for many reasons but my main one being he was hellbent on rejoining the military and I did not have any desire to be a military wife. I tried to compromise and say that I would stay with him as long as he was not okay with not having kids unless he was done being deployed. But he refused to budge on any front and I got fed up and left. Now my ex is an alcoholic. He was in a deep spiral when we first started talking and I was instrumental in getting him into rehab. I sacrificed a lot to help him get into rehabs with beds and willing gave up a year of my life to him to make sure that he was okay and doing well with his sobriety. But in June I was fed up with him refusing to compromise, I had put in an offer on a house and was ready to be settled and I was done waiting for him to decide what he wanted in life. So we stupidly, continued to talk past that break up until I finally had enough the beginning of September and cut him off, blocked him and his family on everything and just tried to live my life. 

Until, on Monday he called me from the rehab he had checked himself into after he picked up again after I cut him off. I missed the call because I was at the gym and when I tried to call back I could not get in contact with him because he didn’t sign a release for me. He called back Tuesday and I agreed to go and pick him up from rehab today, Friday and meet with his counselor so we could talk but I told him in no uncertain terms that this did not mean we were getting back together and it did not mean that I was even ready to accept what he had to say. So I am a teacher and I took a half day to get there early so we could do this meeting and I could get him home without leaving my dog in her crate for an extra two hours after my school day was over. I have picked him up when he was being released before and have always been able to just grab him and go when it was convenient for me to get there. However when I got there I learned he was NOT due out today and our meeting had been schedule for 3 ( which I never would have made if I had worked a full day as the place was 30 mins away and I got out at 240 and which I told him I could not be there till 330). I was pissed. I left livid that I had been lied to and manipulated again. This is the not the first time he’s twisted or omitted things to make me do what he wants. I got in my car, aggravated and sobbing and decided to call as soon as I got home (another 45 min drive) and call and let them know I would not be returning at 3pm. I have plans I made before this all happened for 530pm and I was not going to rearrange my life anymore than I had for him.

"AITA - not going to my cousins wedding. I [25f] am graduating from college (bachelor and masters programs, back to back) this August and have been planning a vacation (10 day road trip) with a few friends in September for well over a year as a done with school celebration. 

In April my cousin announces she’s engaged, I see it on Facebook, (we aren’t very close, she didn’t talk to our whole family for about two years due to conflict about her dad not liking her boyfriend, but it’s all good now I guess). Invitations to the wedding come out in May. And it’s on the weekend I have my vacation planned. We are camping so nothing is booked, but it’s me and two friends who are counting on me going to pay for gas and we are going for 10 days. I’ve been saving up all my pto for this since I started my job (march). 

I thought about changing the first weekend of the trip (leaving later to go to the wedding) but the wedding is 10 hours away from all family. We have to drive there there’s no airport to fly into or anything. I lease a car so can only put so many miles on my car and a 10 hour drive is waaayyy over the amount of miles. The rest of the family is going Monday, so if I wanted to go I would have to go with them. Which means I would have to take the whole week before the wedding off and use all my pto I saved up on it, which means I couldn’t take another vacation for months. If she was having it around where we live I would be more apt to just push back the leaving date of the trip but with it being such a distance it’s no vacation or no wedding. 

On one hand, I feel selfish for not wanting to go to the wedding for my trip. On the other, I’ve been waiting six years being in school to go on a good vacation and have had this planned for over a year. By the time I had up enough pto if I went to the wedding, it would be winter here and we’d have to wait for next summer to take the trip.

"AITA for not liking my friend's friend?. I'm in high school now, and have a close friend in my class, who will be called Alex. If Alex were to ever need help, I would drop everything I have on my hands just to go help him, he's that close of a friend. 

Recently, he has became friends with another guy in out class, who will be called Zack. Zack is a piece of sh*t human being. And it's not just me that thinks that, pretty much everyone in class also thinks that. To give you a run-down on what kind of person Zack is, Zack is two-faced and will act nicely to certain people, and act shitty to others. This is frustrating, because to teachers, he is the golden child. He can do no wrong. So he easily gets away with breaking school rules, like stealing, bullying and fighting. And when reported, the teachers brush it off, since they all think he's the most well behaved human in all the land. This leads to situations where he can get away with anything because ""Oh, I'm sure Zack didn't mean to make that comment about your body weight, he was just saying a joke."" or ""I'm sure you just dropped your wallet into Zack's bag accidentally, he wouldn't want to take it."" Because of his behaviour, I try to stick away from him.

Back to the story, so recently, Zack decides to get closer to Alex, and for some reason only god knows, Alex chooses to become friends with him. This leads to awkward situations where Alex and I are having a conversation, and Alex invites Zack over to join us. As stated above, I want to stay away from Zack as much as possible, so when this happens, I tend to cut the conversation short just to get away. This has worked for a week, until today. 

After I pull my usual tactic of cutting the conversation short, and walking away awkwardly, Alex comes up to confront me. He asks me, what was up with my behaviour this past week. Ever since Zack and Alex became friends, I didn't like it, but chose not to object to it, since it's Alex's choice, I shouldn't be controling him, he can choose to be friends with who he wants, it's respectful that way. But since he was asking, I told him what I thought about Zack. Note that in no part of this conversation have I ever said I wanted him to stop being friends with Zack, I just voiced out my honest opinion on him; he's a d*ck. 

When I tell him this, Alex gets upset, saying I shouldn't be judging other people, and he's mad at me now for not liking Zack.

"AITA for refusing to shoot a wedding?.  

So basically a friend of a friend saw some of my pictures and asked me to shoot a wedding for him over a year from then. I agreed and told him I can do 450$ as I have never shot a wedding before.

I met up with him at his job as he was asking to meet up and we talked with him and his fiancé and I offered another 450$ for video for a total of 900$ if they wanted it. They agreed.

I message him and didn't get a response back for 3 months.

More time goes by and I run into him at a movie theater and there we talk more about it, where I told him I'll have my friend shoot the video so I can focus on pictures but the price will stay the same.

Eventually I meet them where the wedding will take place and talk about payment again. I offered for them to pay half before and half after or 850$ if they pay all before the wedding. 

They agreed we even talked about video length, what songs they might want etc.

Fast forward to now, about 2 months before the wedding he asks if he can do photo only for 450$ since they don't care about video and said that he thought I told him my friend would do it for ""experience"". I told him I never said that the video would be done for free and I never once said anything about doing a free video for ""experience"".

He tells me he just doesn't want someone he doesn't know to walk around his wedding when they have expensive nice things and to pay him 450$, he also tells me its just another person to feed and take up a seat. He tells me his father knows a photographer and videographer that could do all the work for 1000$.

I told him that it sounds good and he should hit that person up. 

He begs to have me still do his wedding, but I refused and told him I don't want to work for someone who treats people like that. He called me and began apologizing but I told him I don't think it will work out for us, then mid-call I get his message he sent after I missed his first call saying ""oh I guess you don't want to talk on the phone like a man"" I told him to tell his fiance to read that message he sent so she can understand why I refuse.

I feel bad for the fiance as she is now scrambling to find someone for the wedding. I messaged her trying to explain and sent her screenshots of the conversation in hopes that she can understand. I also told her I will look for other photographers that might be able to accept her wedding in time, but I can't work for someone like that.

Ultimately I feel shitty because I don't know what they are going to do, but I felt insulted from him acting as if he doesn't need me, acting as if my friends are just mouths to feed or possibly dangerous, and the shot at me not being a man for missing the first call. That being said his fiance did nothing wrong and I genuinely feel sorry for everything that she is now going through.

My friend has always been an insecure person due to some past issues with family, and I understand that as well as usually try to reassure her. She doesn't have many friends as well, so I'm her main social structure.

The issue that has arose between us recently is that she feels a risk of being replaced as I have began dating someone. Although I have reassured her that this would not be the case, she continued to think so, finally culminating in an explosion whereby she informed me that she was hurt by the fact that I went to an art gallery with the person I'm dating. My friend likes art galleries but I'm not that keen on them i.e. I would not go to one of my own volition but if someone invited me e.g. like my date, I would probably go. She felt hurt as apparently she had intentionally refrained from inviting me to such activities out of fear I would be bored, yet I went with someone else. 

I was confused as if she had invited me before, I would definitely join her. However, she explained to me that I failed to take her feelings into consideration regarding this, even when I pointed out that she had never even invited me to an art gallery before. She said that I am forgetting about her now that I have a new squeeze. She's still mad about it although I have apologised. 

So Reddit, AITA?","This is about her feeling like you are replacing her, not about visiting an art gallery. This belongs on the relationship subreddit.",0,0,0,0,1
AITA for not paying for my friends bike that was stolen?. The other day my friend came down to my house to play video games and watch YouTube among other shit. He cycled down from his house about 20 mins away and locked his bike on a pole outside my house and when he was leaving the bike and the lock were gone. He never asked to bring his bike inside my house and the bike was locked in the pole before he rang the bell. However I still could of asked him if he wanted to bring it inside. It's also known that bikes get stolen a lot in my area. He thinks I should pay for a new bike but the majority of my friends think I shouldn't. I don't know what to do as I also don't feel I was responsible for his bike but I also feel bad because it wouldn't of happened if I hadn't invited him over. AITA?,NTA.

"AITA for not telling him I had sex during breakup. Ex bf and I dated 4 years. Check comments for reasons. 

We’ve been broken up for a year. In October we tried to be friends/date. It didn’t go well. He name called, made snide comments, arguments lasted for hours, even if I agreed with him. 

His main issue was if I had sex with anyone else during our breakup. October would mark 10 months. I said I didn’t think it was a good idea to talk about this because nothing good can come out of it. He kept pushing and I said no. He didn’t believe me and asked “did you do anything else? Because I don’t accept you giving blow jobs, hand jobs, or other men touching you, its all sex”. Of course I did other stuff. This went on for days and we just stopped talking when I wouldn’t disclose.

December will mark 1 year. We’ve decided to try again. I had 4 conditions (comments), one was sexual history is off limits. He didn’t agree, saying “I don’t talk to exes who had sex with other men”. 

I feel like he was trying to get me to deny it from the way he worded it. I was so irritated. I just replied saying “Okay I understand. Please enjoy the holidays and Merry Christmas”. He probably thinks I had sex, but I just didn’t want to deal with it anymore.

My manager, who owns said SK is a horrible person. I think she may be bipolar, but I’m not sure. But the way she acts is not normal. 95% of the time she isn’t in store, but she’ll watch us from an app on her phone that’s connected to the cameras in the store, and calls if she sees something she doesn’t like(which majority of the time are out of context because she’s very irrational). She chastised me once for not calling her when I’d been waiting outside the store for her(she was over 45 minutes late) when I had no way to call her or access the store. She’s called me a liar, insinuated twice that I stole money from my own register, and would call the police the next time. Turns out she’d been in my drawer earlier both times and  messed up the count(she’s really bad with money) and she forces us to reuse the leftovers of old smoothies in new ones which I think is extremely unethical and dangerous, as people have allergies and dietary restrictions. And if we don’t reuse them she’ll either make us pay for it, write us up, or fire us.

Also, I wrote a letter for when I’m finally able to quit that basically tells her off and I was planning on putting it in our work groupchat so she can’t twist it and make it seem like she wasn’t a factor in me leaving.(which she’s done with everyone of my old coworkers) any advice is appreciated",NTA please report the unsafe practices and the treatment of workers.

I don't know how she knew that, but my best friend tried to ruin my next encounters with him. She took my cell phone, stole my keys and spread rumors about me, which I find very childish. And when I knew it was her, I had no doubt of kicking her out of my apartment.

"AITA for wanting to change my last name?. So I came out as trans (ftm) 2 years ago and, in my opinion, have been really understanding towards my family (not getting mad when they deadname or misgender me, not arguing when they decide to try and tell me I’m wrong, even tried giving them resources and explain only to have them get angry and shut me down). 

I recently had surgery and called my dad on the way home to let him know I came out ok and he started lecturing me on the phone, saying not to come around him if I don’t shave because he doesn’t wanna see it. (I didn’t shave before going to his house on thanksgiving because I didn’t want to, and I shouldn’t have to). I lost it a little bit and said if he was so worried about it then he could shave my face himself, to which he said “no, your mom or your friends can do that. Just don’t come around if you’re not gonna shave” and I responded by saying “if I don’t wanna shave then I’m not going to”. He said I wasn’t respecting his feelings and I told him that he hasn’t respected mine in a very long time. A few days later we talked and he said that he can’t stop me from doing what I need to be happy but not to bring it around him because “I don’t understand it, I don’t accept right now and I don’t want to accept it because I don’t feel like it” so I told him if he can’t make an effort at all to try and at least understand then I can’t talk to him anymore because it hurts me too much (any time I’m at his house I pretty much get isolated by everyone, and I used to be very close to all of them). He decided that he didn’t want to make that effort. 

My dad and I have been very close my whole life up until now and it really hurts and I feel bad for wanting to change my last name, but it’s an uncommon last name and I don’t want to be associated with someone that doesn’t even want me around. I’ve spoken to my mom and other family members and they all said “he’s probably already hurt, don’t hurt him more by changing your last name. You’re overreacting”. I have other people telling me that they think it’s the right thing to do (especially since changing my last name would make it harder to find past information about me online). I’ve also gotten a lot of questions like “what if he talks to you again?” And I said “well, I guess he’d have to live with it”

"AITA for not calling our siblings about our engagement before posting to social media?. My fiancé and I have been together for seven years. Everyone knew my SO would be proposing to me since we shopped for my ring together. My fiancé asked my dad for permission which led to my dad telling my brother and extended family. My fiancé asked his sisters for advice on how to pop question and ended up in a fight with his sister over Mother’s Day because we planned on seeing my parents that day to give him the chance to ask my dad for my hand.

"AITA for hanging out after work. I bartend 2 nights a week and get off around 5AM. About once or twice every other week I will go to a coworkers house and chill out, watch a Netflix episode, vent about work (yay nightlife) and smoke. I uber home, the latest being 730AM. 

The issue: my bf has a huge problem with this. He thinks my job is unsafe as it is and that I should come home straight away and he also doesn’t like that I’m hanging out after work that late with a male. He also dislikes that when I do this, I wake up around 1PM the next day. 

In my defense, I do this when we have no commitments or plans on the weekend. Also, the coworker is a fellow bartender, in a committed relationship, and a gay male. I am a straight female. I am ubering straight home from my friends house. I always text when I leave and screenshot the Uber information. I am usually buzzing, but pleasantly so, and am able to be aware of my surroundings. My friend also makes sure that I get home safe and waits for a “home safe” text. This is basically the only time I really hang out, besides an occasional quick lunch date. I go to school full time during the week and it’s pretty rigorous.  Besides the whole bartending gig I have a pretty normal schedule and bf and I do get quality time and dates together. I feel that the couple times a month (3-5x) I hang out is something I look forward to, especially after a stressful shift. My bf works a 9-5 and I am very considerate when I get home (super quiet, use the other bathroom to get ready). 

I’ve tried to pinpoint the exact reason why he doesn’t like this so that I could compromise, or find a solution but essentially he simply wants me to come straight home. We have asked our friends, separately, and responses were varied. I think this boils down to a personality/lifestyle difference and it’s a NAH situation, but if one of us is in the wrong, I’d like to know, as well as why.

"AITA for not wanting to learn my mother's native language, but instead wanting to learn easier languages?. 
Newbie here. I'm biracial [20F] and live in the country that my mother is from with both of my parents. English is used often here but most of the population also speak the native language (some only speak the native language). My mother only spoke English to me growing up, and the nature of this language is that it's far easier to pick up as a child than trying to learn it later in life.  I struggled to learn it in primary school and decided to learn French in high school instead, which I picked up way faster. As a result I really want to learn more French as well as Italian and Portuguese. It seems more relevant to me because the languages are widely spoken internationally whereas only people from this country speak the language. 

The reason I don't want to learn the native language is that people here, including my extended family, are really rude about it. Everyone believes that if you're from here you have to know the language and if you don't know it you don't have a claim to this nationality. Also, people here can be racist. I don't speak the language but I can understand it, and people often point out that I'm ""white"" (they say the equivalent in the language) whenever I'm speaking English at the home village or just in public places. Not to mention the comments that some men make as I walk past. 

At this point, I don't even want to know what they're saying. I don't want to learn the language of people who don't even think I belong here because of my skin tone or the way I speak. It's much easier for me to just ignore people (catcalling, racist remarks) or explain politely that I only speak in English. I'm also moving overseas, so I don't see the point in making a big effort now.

I do feel really bad. I feel disconnected from one half of myself, and I feel like my mom wishes I knew her language better. However if she really wanted that, she should have taught it to me and my siblings as kids! 

tldr; I don't want to learn my native language because of the judgment I get from thus society, but I want to learn other easier languages. Am I the Asshole?","Nta. You didnt say which is your native language but I'm guessing from the description it is not going to be much use in a global economy, English , French,  Portuguese  etc will be far more useful to you going forward.

"AITA for being upset that my parents don't care about my pet?.  As a bit of background, I own a lone guinea pig named Milo. My parents got him for my 10th birthday. I believe it was because I commented on an illustration of a longhaired guinea pig when I was 8, because I don't remember having any prior interest in them.

 The first issue I have is that they don't seem to have done any research on guinea pigs. They wanted me to do the research after I got him. They got him the bare minimum and then expected me to know how to care for him. 

 He's turning 4 soon and I feel incredibly guilty he's been stuck alone in a tiny cage for so long. I've asked about getting him a bigger cage that I'll pay for myself. I brought up a DIY cage. My mom doesn't seem enthusiastic about it because she doesn't want 'poopy fleece' in the washing machine even after I explained there are other methods of cleaning. I'm waiting to hear from my father but I doubt his response will be different.

 The only time they seem to notice him is if he's loud or they think he smells bad. It seems like they're wanting me to earn the privledge to visit the pet store and I don't want him to go without basic needs because of my actions.

 I understand that being older means more responsibility, but I don't think it's fair that they're blackmailing me with an animal's suffering. I understand my actions have consequences but I don't think one of those consequences should compromise an animal's wellbeing.

 I didn't ask for Milo or the responsibility but he is still my furbaby and I want what's best for him especially now that he's nearing the end of his life.

"AITA? My mother has forced me to get a new phone number and I refuse to help her pay the cancellation fee on the old one.. So, for a little backstory, my mother and I had an agreement back when I was living with her. I give her the money for my phone bill and she pays it alongside hers. It was cheaper and I was happy to not be involved with the technical bullshit.

Fast forward to the beginning of this year, I moved out(I was/am 19) because I couldn’t stand being around her. It doesn’t matter who was right or wrong, it’s basically a she said/he said thing, but I couldn’t stand the constant arguments and it was really taking a toll on my mental health. I tried to keep our deal up afterwards, but she was just so toxic even over the phone. So I asked her to help me separate our phone plans, get *my number* put on an account under *my name*. She tried once and, when the service provider stuffed up, she refused to try again. 
I spent months trying anything I could to get my number separated from her account, anything from calling and spending ages on hold to going in personally in order to sort this out.

My only options were to get a new number or have my mother’s consent.

I was on a good plan and I really wanted to avoid getting a new number if I could so I resolved to just keep sending her the money and no longer interact with her. It worked, for two glorious months of No Contact, but then she messaged me and I found out something that pissed me off. We were on a shared data plan, meaning she and my siblings could use up the data *I WAS PAYING FOR* from their end and there was nothing I could do to stop it. 
Apparently they’d used up all but 700mb and mum demanded that I turn of my mobile data, then got pissed when I said no because I needed to be on call for work.

So I asked again, “please let’s try and get our phone plans separated, I’ll even do all the work, all you have to do is give your consent when they call to confirm”

“No!” Is what she said, completely refused to do anything of the sort. 
So I was left with no other option but to get a new number and I’d been putting it off because of how tedious the process was gonna be, but I literally had no other options.

Then I let her know, giving a chance to say goodbye because there was no way in hell I was giving her my new number so she could harass me. And that’s when she said it. 

“You have to pay the $140 cancellation fee then!”

That’s literally my rent for the week! I don’t have that much! Plus the number I’ve gotten is more expensive and gives me less data so I’m already getting the short end money wise. So I don’t see why I have to pay when she literally gave me no other choice! As far as I’m concerned, she’s the one who didn’t want to separate our phone plans so *she* can deal with the consequences. If she’d just cooperated then it would’ve taken less time on both of our ends and there would’ve been no need for *either* of us to pay a cancellation fee!

But I don’t know, Am I the Asshole here?

///Edit///
I forgot to mention that she’s also trying to blackmail me into paying the cancellation fee with the threat of throwing out the few things I left with her that wouldn’t fit in my suitcase, nothing new to me, not that adding this would make much of difference as it seems that everyone so far has unanimously said NTA.

Long story short, I don't like her or her husband anymore. They're lazy and always back out of things but always expect you to do stuff with them in return. 

I've extended my hand and suggestions to them many a time only for them to go with ""We're tired"" or ""Nahh"" but they always say ""You should x with us"" or ""Hey, maybe play x, it's a cool game and we're playing it, you should pay money and play the same game we play"" but ask them the same in return and it's always no.

I don't consider that good companionship, not for me anyway. And the wife is a self-admitted control freak that I want nothing to do with.

Her husband and I are cool, we talk about surface level things and that's exactly how I prefer them to be. Why? Because he also gives advice that I never ask for, it's so patronizing like ""Come here little baby sit on my lap and lemme tell you about big adult stuff""  (he's *8 years older than me*, acts like he's 55 or something). 

Also, the wife always finds out about whatever I'm talking to him about and again, comes to my DMs with pouty emotes and advice that I never asked for, and I'm appalled that she takes it upon herself to take the role of advice-giver for stuff I never talked to her about. Husband does the same thing, so 

So I'm considering telling my boyfriend ""Hey, please please do me a favor and don't mention any of *my* personal business to them. Not about jobs, not about any developments in my life, nothing. If they ask, 'She's fine!' and leave it at that. You can talk about *our* business but as far as anything going on with me, leave it out.""

"AITA for asking my parents for privacy, even though I don’t pay rent?. First of all I want to say I understand how lucky I am to not have to pay rent, especially at 28 years old, and am truly grateful. Just a little back story, I recently moved back with my parents due to my own health issues and an issue with my previous apt (roommate was not paying rent and landlord wouldn’t fix things). I do work and am more than capable to pay rent and I offered but my parents said they don’t want me. I’m very lucky. I do my best to help around the house and buy groceries etc.

My issue is that my parents give me very little privacy. They will walk in my room without knocking and when I’ve confronted them in the past they say “if you have nothing to hide, there should be nothing to worry about.” I’ve argued with them about how they’d feel if I did this to them and they say “go ahead, we have nothing to hide,” which honestly I don’t even believe they mean that, but they know I would never actually follow through. This has all made me feel a bit uncomfortable, like are they trying to catch me doing something? 

When I started moving my stuff back in, my mom offered to help me put stuff away in my room and I said she didn’t have to, but she insisted. In the past when I’ve refused help from her she has called me ungrateful, so I don’t even try to argue anymore. Anyway while putting stuff away she found condoms and a bowl (I haven’t smoked in months, I must’ve just forgot to toss it out), and she made some awkward jokes/scolding remarks that made me uncomfortable. (Just to note I’d never actually smoke in the house). Then The other day my dad walked in to my room 5 times between 8am and 10am without knocking while I’m sleeping on my day off to “find socks,” because apparently they were leaving for a trip and he couldn’t find his own? I have no idea.
I also work remotely from my room sometimes so I need privacy and when I explained this my mom said “then get a no disturb sign,” to which I responded “why don’t you just knock?” and she said “because sometimes I just really need to ask you things.”... WTF does that even mean?

Anyway WIBTA if I began locking my door and refusing to open unless they knock?

Edit: to answer a few questions: I’ve been back a month, and also know from experience and my older brother that this isn’t just an adjustment period as some have suggested, they have a history of invading privacy. (Mom would snoop through our apts when she’d visit).
Also I don’t think they’re doing this to make me want to leave. Quite the contrary, I think they’re really lonely and like having me in the house.

25 Male, Manager at a Restaurant for 8 months. Co-worker is 19 Male, also Manager for the same amount of time as me.

**Scenario**

My Wife and I have been having problems with our house that we've lived in for 8 months now. Come to found out, there's zero insulation in the attic and all of our heat is escaping. We set up a plan to wake at 9am, get the supplies to amend this; then I can head to work at 5pm (working until close @10pm). We spend awhile getting supplies, head straight home and start the job. Many problems and solutions later, it's 4pm, and I haven't even started blowing the actual insulation. The rental equipment is only free for today, so to save money, the job must be completed today. We also can't have my pregnant wife and toddler son breathing uncleaned fiberglass insulation, so I really want to finish and clean everything all in one go.

I tell my General Manager (GM) that I can't come in, but he refuses my statement and says that I'm not allowed to call off. I attempt to find a replacement, but no other Managers are available. A standard employee can cover, but GM says no. I consult with the Wife, who agrees with my desire to finish today and call in. I tell the GM again that I'm not coming in and that I'll just accept the disciplinary warning. I at least offer to come in when I'm done so nobody else has to complete nightly money/inventory paperwork.

Co-worker texts me saying that he has dinner plans with his family and feels obligated to work a double shift (working my night in addition to his day) if I don't show up. I apologize, tell him that I won't be coming and the conversation ends there. Turns out my co-worker got so stressed out that he had a panic attack, which turned into a seizure; causing him to fall and hit his head and get sent to the Hospital. I didn't discover these events until I finished my task at 9pm and told the GM that I could now come to finish the paperwork. He recounted the story, told me he would do paperwork, not to worry about it and that he'd see me tomorrow to sign a disciplinary sheet. Everything minus the panic-induced seizure was expected.

The total amount is about 70$ (now hear me out, this is not the US and that's a huge amount of money for me. Maybe it's about 1/3 of the money I save in a year.)

He told me and I didn't belive he had found it, so I told him to show me proof. He did so and tried to run away to put the money in his moneybox, which can't be opened once the money is in unless you break it.

Because this I started running to catch him and ended up having a physical altercation with him (nothing important or particularly bloody, just a fight for the money/pride on the floor.) Eventually I won and got my money back.

"AITA for cutting my friends off for getting in a relationship with an ex-fling?. I met one of my previous best friends in school back in early 2012, and we became friends instantly. About a year and a half later, we both developed feelings for each other, but didn't say or do anything until last Christmas break.

Earlier this year, I would go to parties almost every weekend with my friend group, and get shitfaced... the nights always ended up with me and her in a bathroom making out...  
Then at pride, I met a really nice guy, and we were flirting and ended up making out. He then became a part of the party group. We also became very good friends, and he knew everything between me and the girl from 2012

My friend and I keep on making out at parties until August, where it stopped instantly, and I lost 7 friends (4 of those have been in my life since 2011). Because I found out that the guy who I sort of liked (but had gotten over), and the girl (who I hadn't quite gotten over) had started dating, and decided to tell everyone except me.   
Mind you, I was really close to the girl due to a really long friendship.

I got really hurt. Not that hurt from who it was with, more that she didn't want me to know.

The next day, I talked to two of my friends on facetime to figure out what was happening. And one of them told me that she didn't understand why she kept hooking up with me, since she doesn't have feelings for me.   
She had told me every time, that she still liked me. But made it clear she didn't want anything serious, which I agreed with. 

During that call, I also found out she has been sharing secrets, spreading rumors, and talking badly about me behind my back.

After I found out about everything, I cut her and those who didn't agree with me out of my life. 

I ended up with two friends... Who have also cut ties with the bitch

"AITA for telling my mother that I don't feel qualified to give imput on her marriage.. TDLR: Mother called me saying stepfather had started drinking lightly. Told her I didn't feel qualified to give imput, she got mad at me.

My (22F) mother (50F) married my stepfather (55M) 8 years ago when I was 14.  Before they had met he had been an alcoholic, he has been sober for the past 13 years. He hasn't really talked about that time in his life, this never bothered me because I didn't think it was any of my business. My mother and I have had a tumultuous relationship the past few years, it's better now but we don't really discuss any deep aspects of our lives with each other. I also have two young siblings who live with my mother and stepfather.

My mother called not long ago and abruptly told me he has started to drink again, no context only that he has had a drink a few times the past week. I felt that it was odd that she was telling me instead of talking to her husband. I understand that she would need to vent to someone but I don't feel like I could give any opinion that was what she wanted or honest. I told her right away that I wasn't sure if I was the best person to talk to it because I don't know the situation. I didn't want to be put between my mother, stepfather and grown siblings.

She immediately told me I was being rude in regard to her wellbeing and that of my siblings. She then told me that she had spoken to my other siblings about it already and that I should be able to talk to her about it. I tried telling her I would but I don't know how she wanted me to react. She then hung up on me.

I feel like many are going to say that I should have suggested that my parents should see a marriage counselor. I was going to tell her this but she hung up on me before I could. They also live in a very rural area and she is too cheap to talk to a professional anyway.

"AITA for refusing to work with this person again because he owed me twenty dollars from a previous shoot?. Months ago, back in September, I was asked to do a cosplay style photoshoot with a photographer- paid. He agreed to my fees, as well as the 'if you cancel day of, please pay half' fee. We were excited, got the costume ready, and I was very communicative and, I thought, professional, as a model. I worked with him on price to be within his budget, and I even set aside multiple hours multiple times for phone calls and meetings to talk about the shoot. This was fairly large scale, group shoot, videos as well as scripted- I was setting aside an entire day for this.

The day comes and, sure enough, he cancels on me. The costumes weren't done in time- it was something on his end. He asked me to reschedule, to my boyfriend's birthday. I told him I would only have that morning free, since I wanted to spend the afternoon and evening with my boyfriend. He was understanding, apologized, and promised to get me the fee when he could. It wasn't a huge deal to me, I wasn't in a rush for the money, but I was a little frustrated that I set aside all those hours for nothing.

Weeks pass.He told me he was having some financial difficulties, but he'd get it to me soon. He said he had to pay a different model because she was harassing him for it, so he thanked me for being so 'patient'.More weeks pass.He wasn't communicating with me much anymore, but said he still wanted to meet with me to talk future shoots. I agreed a couple times and we chatted at a coffee shop near my part time job, him always promising me that fee.Finally, I said I couldn't keep setting time aside to talk shoots until he agreed to at least partial payment, after months had passed.He gave me the fee, minus twenty dollars, and said he'd get me the other twenty as soon as he could. Then he asked me to pay for his latte.

I was so, so irritated. I told him off over text the next day, that he shouldn't be contacting me about shoots if he can't afford to do them. He kept saying he was good for it. I've never valued money more than my friendships, but this was supposed to be a professional relationship. He acted like I was being a terrible friend for not modeling for him, but I just can't work on a 'I'll pay you most of it in three months' type of payment plan, either!

"AITA for being mad at my aunt?. Back in January I got hired at a local Chick-fil-A, but got let go after about 10 days. My initial contract stated that during my first 30 days I could be let go at any time if they felt I wasn't the right ""fit"".

Probably worth mentioning that I have Asperger's, so while I picked up on the technical skills like the POS near instantly, I had a tendency to trip over my words and just be generally a bit awkward when dealing with customers. And Chick-fil-A tends to prioritize your people skills over your technical skills. But that's not the issue here.

So I'm let go, I'm a little bummed cause I have a history of struggling to get hired anywhere and a little annoyed to have to start the job-finding process over again. But whatever. I did manage to find a work study job at my school's campus ID center.

My parents come down to my college for a weekend in February, the weekend after I'd just been let go.

"AITA for telling my husband he absolutely cannot keep helping out his friends?. Hey guys,


So my husband has a good friend that he's known basically his whole life. They grew up together, and have known eachother for 20+ years. Needless to say, they're very close and consider eachother family. 


His friend has a girlfriend, and a while back they went homeless. (They ended up stopping going to work because they got too caught up doing drugs and went on a bender which they actually told my husband) after losing their jobs, they also lost their apartment. We let them stay with us for a while, and they were terrible to live with.


We have 2 toddlers, and I work 2 jobs, so I have my hands full and barely get time to sleep as it is. They would stay up until the early hours of the morning partying and blasting music, and I couldn't even get them to stop because my husband joined in on the drinking (he was sober until then) and got caught up in the partying too, which led to me not only barely sleeping before work, but constantly having to coax two kids back to sleep. Needless to say, I put my foot down and said they had to leave.


My husband then cosigned them an new apartment. He said he trusted them and it would be fine. Well it wasn't, they couldn't keep a job, we ended up buying them groceries and paying their rent several times until we could no longer afford it, and they got evicted. We had to take out multiple loans to pay for everything and now we're barely scrapping by. 


Anyways, now they're coming to my husband asking him to help them pay for a weekly hotel and for groceries. I told him absolutely not, we've already done way too much and we are not spending another penny on them. He said I can't expect him to turn his back on his friends, and I told him if he values our relationship he will because I cannot deal with them anymore and either they get out of our lives or I'm going to be out of his. I'm tired of them draining our money and energy and pushing my husband into drinking again when he hasn't in nearly 2 years. My husband seems torn right now because he said he doesn't want to lose his family but he doesn't want to turn his back on his brother.

"AITA for telling a coworker I don’t find him attractive. So there’s this new guy at work and I was in charge of training him and showing him around. He’s around my age, (early 20s), and he seemed like a cool guy. 

I would always say hi to him, and we would do small talk, which I do with everyone that works with me. I’ll admit, sometimes i get told I can be “too friendly,” but I don’t think I was being flirty with him at all. 

This wasn’t an issue where he was filing a report for harassment or anything, but he pretty much told another coworker that he thinks I like him, and that “she’s cute, but I have a girlfriend.” 

When my coworker told me about this, I felt like if I stopped being friendly it would seem like I did like him and was mad about the gf, but it also bothered me too much to let it go. So i talked to him about it. 

He said maybe he misunderstood, but he thought I got too touchy at some points, which shocked me, seeing as I’ve never touched him, or even shook hands with this guy. He also mentioned how I was always giggly with him, and yes but I laugh at EVERYTHING, not just with him. I calmly denied it and apologized if he thought I was coming on to him.  He pretty much rolled his eyes, and went, “yeah, okay,” in a sarcastic tone. 

I was annoyed, bc to me it seemed like he was trying to act like hot shit, so I just told him I didn’t even find him attractive, and might’ve made unnecessary comments about his height. He pretty much told me to fuck off, and my manager found out about all of this. 

Now this is where I felt like the asshole, because i had been there longer, my manager automatically sided with me, and there was a small instance where she insinuated she might fire or transfer, even though I was the one who made the mean comments. 

One of my other coworkers said I was an asshole, and commented on how tough he must have it, seeing as he just started. Up until this point, I felt like ESH but AITA??

"WIBTA for not giving a former coworker a contract at my new job?. I worked as an office manager at a furniture company. Basically they sold office furniture. The owner was a fucking idiot who used the company's money to fund a lifestyle he could not sustain. That led to serious financial issues for the company and he even asked me to take a pay cut and do more work. Of course, I refused. I had a strong feeling that I was on the chopping block but everyone told me I was safe.
I trusted one of my coworkers, Andy, to tell me of I was getting fired. I just needed to know if I had to start job searching. He told me he had not heard anything and to chill out. Well, I got fired and he had known. I don't begrudge him for lying to me because obviously we didn't have that relationship.
I struggled but found a better job as an office manager for a large accounting firm. The furniture company went out of business a year later. My office is moving to a bigger building and needed to furnish. Procurement and I were in charge of that. We met with several potential vendors and one of sales reps was Andy. He was working with a new company. He were shocked to see each other. 
Andy trying to leverage that we had a relationship to get the contract (worth mid six-figures; most are five-figures).

I don't care what legit reasons he had. He made a choice and now he wants it both ways.
TBH, had he stuck his neck out for me at my old job, then I would give him the contract because loyalty is a good thing to have in business. But he didn't so I don't feel like I should stick my neck out for him and his commission check.

"AITA for calling my suitemates out for being disgusting and horrible?. So I just moved out of my college suite and was packing when I realized that the bathroom was still filthy, despite having an entire conversation with my (three) suitemates about who was going to clean what and when. It turns out that two of them (we'll call them X and Y) left ALL the work for Z to do by herself. Z is a senior and graduates in two days so she has a ton of stuff to pack as well as lots of parties to attend. I cleaned my part of the bathroom already, as any good person would.

SO I wrote a good paragraph letting them know how appalled I was that they left all that work for poor Z, who hasn't done anything wrong all year and has been nothing but sweet this whole time. In the paragraph I said:

""i am appalled. this whole year being suitemates has been a mess. you guys are some of the rudest people i have ever met. all year you are loud AF and always leaving nasty stuff out. and then you guys just walk out without cleaning ANYTHING? what? you’re seriously leaving it for poor Z to do all by herself? you guys disgust me. have some f---ing decency. @X @Y""

X then responded saying she and Y cleaned what she could which was a lie, because I asked Z and she said that she saw neither X nor Y clean the bathroom, and to be honest it really did look untouched. X then said I was the only one that ever complained, despite that being far from true (as you can see below).

But here's the thing.

They have been doing this all year. I constantly see makeup all over the counter (in and sometimes out of it containers) and piles (yes, PILES) of hair all over the bathroom. One time my roommate and I even had to clean up their UNWRAPPED bloody pads and tampons that had not been taken care of for a good 2+ weeks and lecture them on how to properly dispose of a pad, despite the fact that we are all **adult females** (cause for real, who doesn't know how to do that at the age of 20??). My roommate and I had to clean up their UNWRAPPED bloody pads and tampons that had not been taken care of for a good 2+ weeks. There's been SEVERAL times either me or my roommate had to say something to them, asking them to pick up their piles of hair, stop shouting (they LOVE yelling), to turn their blasting music down, to stop talking loudly in the bathroom at 8am on a saturday morning, etc.

"AITA for divorcing an alcoholic?. This will be kinda long, so bear with me. So, I was dating someone for a few years and we got engaged. During the dating period and through the engagement, now ex-wife was a very heavy drinker, drank minimum of a 6-pack a night (she was pretty tiny, only 5'3""). Not only was it expensive, that kind of drinking at such a young age (early 20s) with no sign of slowing down, even after a DUI, was dangerous. She agreed that the drinking needed to back off and she promised after the wedding she would. Well, after a very expensive wedding her parents paid for, she didn't change at all. After about 6 months, I finally confronted her about it, brought up her promise and she agreed she would restrict her drinking to weekends. Well, that lasted about two weeks. One weeknight she went out after work with some coworkers and I fully expected her to have a beer or two, and I didn't mind. She had learned her lesson about drinking and driving, so she never had more than 2 when she had to drive and even then made sure enough time passed for it to not be in her system. When she got home, I went for a kiss and she actively pulled away and tried to hide her breath from me. I was angry about her trying to hide something from me, not the drinking, and I told her as much. She promised, yet again, that she'll slow down, but she never did. After about another 6 months of broken promises I decided to just end it. She said I was an asshole for letting her parents pay for such an expensive wedding just to divorce me, but I couldn't handle being lied to anymore. So, AITA?

Note: I hated the fact that the wedding was so ritzy and expensive and fought it the whole time, I wanted a simpler setting and less expensive outing, but her parents insisted because that is what ex-wife wanted","NTA.

Alcoholism is a very legitimate reason for a divorce. You are not an asshole at all in this situation. Sorry about your wife’s disease, she is in a lot of pain right now. 

FYI - she cannot have 1 or 2 beers, because addiction will make her have more. She has to remain completely sober to recover. And it’s up to her to do it. More chances from you will not help it.

"AITA for cutting off a former friend and advising current ones to do the same?. This has been on my mind for a very long time now. TLDR at the end. Back in 2016, when I was in my second year of high school, I met a couple of guys who had a lot of common interests with me (regarding anime, video games, movies, etc), so I tried to start a friendship of some sort.

These guys had their own small friend group but even so they were still kinda ostracized or at least excluded from the rest of the class. Both of them were pretty introverted and nerdy (when it comes to studying and certain interests), so I kinda just talked to them when I could in the beginning, trying to integrate them in my main group of friends.

But one of those guys, ""Paul"", started acting really weird towards me. Every morning when I got there and it was just the two of us I'd say hi and take my seat. He would always ask ""What are you doing?"" and poke his head over me or my desk, which I didn't mind at first, but after a while it became very tiring. I would be finishing an urgent assignment, studying for an important test or just browsing some personal things on my phone and even when I showed absolute no interest in interacting with him, he would continue there pressing me and invading my personal space in a physical way (which I've always had a huge problem with, and he knew that).

Not only that but he would text me EVERY DAY. Like I said, when he got my number it was no big deal, we were talking normally and I was glad to have a friend with the same interests as me (since there were none in my main friend group). But after about 5 months or so, it got really annoying. I would tell him a lot of times ""Oh I'll watch this video later when I can"", ""I'm studying right now"", ""I've got class now"", trying to convey that I was very busy. Not only did that never work, but he would then absolutely flood my phone (like 20 messages in 10 minutes) so that I could answer later.

Also something I noticed after all this time is that he tended to be quite condescending when discussing our common interests with me (which I fucking hate). After I found reddit, I found the sub that described him perfectly, r/iamverysmart.

About a year went by with me trying to avoid interacting with Paul as a friend, I wanted to be a colleague at most, since he started getting pretty obsessive and being near him was downright uncomfortable. I know that I should have confronted him about me not wanting to be friends anymore, but I was so scared of hurting his feelings that I just tried to back away quietly.  Eventually, in like mid-2017, he stopped invading my space in class and the daily messages finally stopped. I was so happy, since this was my senior year and I really wanted to focus on getting into a good university, and I couldn't  handle anymore stress from him.

But then, in the second half of 2017, Paul started to flood two of my female friends (from that main friend group) with messages just like he did to me. The same behaviors of invading their space as well. They both are like me and didn't want to hurt his feelings, so they endured it. We graduated, he went to a public university,  I went to another one in a different town, and these two girls took 2018 to try again for the university they wanted (here in Brazil to get into universities you have to take a test at the end of the year and try to make through the cut). We thought it was all over, but no: he would still message them endlessly.

It got to a point where they were so stressed that they were afraid they wouldn't pass the test they were studying so hard for, because he would take so much of their time. I kept telling them to block him (I blocked him after they told me how they were so stressed), but they still didn't want to make him feel bad. 

Then, he started talking about his depression to one of the girls. She shared the messages in a group chat asking for help, and we were pretty scared about how he would react to her responses. We told her to tell Paul to seek psychological treatment, he kept saying he didn't need it, the conversation ended. After a while it was all the same again, and they both pitied him a lot, feeling really bad for him after that talk.

I spent about 3 months trying to convince them to block him, regardless of his mental state. 2019 rolled by and one of them got the courage to do so and blocked him yesterday, but the one Paul sent the depressed messages to hasn't. She's scared that he might do something crazy to himself if she blocks him, but I keep insisting that she does so, because her mental health has gotten pretty bad over this as well.

I personally don't think he would hurt himself, but these things can never be overlooked. I feel pretty shitty trying to cut some of the only friends Paul has off of his life, but they're my friends too and I feel they don't deserve to be someone's emotional crutch.

So AITA for advocating so hard for them to just disappear from his life? I don't know how to feel, he is really fucking annoying, but we were some of his only friends and he clearly has a lot of issues. Some friends told me that I was too harsh for cutting him off, and even after a whole year after doing so I still feel guilty.

Sorry for the long post, first one in here.

"AITA for dating my ex-girlfriend's younger sister?. I posted the full back-story a couple of weeks ago on a different subreddit ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b7didc/my\_28m\_exgirlfriend\_27fs\_sister\_22f\_is\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b7didc/my_28m_exgirlfriend_27fs_sister_22f_is_still/)) but I'll précis it here for you:

I'd (28M) been with Sarah (27F) (not her real name) since we were teenagers, and we were living in different cities, trying to save up enough for a house together. Her sister Katie (22F) (again, not her real name) applied to university in my city, and after a year in halls moved in with me for economy's sake. We'd known each other forever, it was fine, solved problems all round.

Just over a year and a half ago, Sarah told me she had been cheating on me in a massive way. She had been in a relationship with another guy for about three months, and had been living in his house, only coming back to the flat at weekends when I was coming down to visit. She decided that she wanted to live with him openly and was tired of lying to me. She admitted that most weekends she would find time to go back and have sex with him if there was an opportunity to once I had fallen asleep. It was a horrible shock and I felt completely numb for weeks.

After 18 months, Katie was still living with me (non-romantically). I wasn't sure what to do about this, and when I posted on r/relationships, I was just coming round to the realisation that I liked having her around and didn't want her to leave. Since I posted, we've spent more time together socially, and on Monday I asked if she'd like to go for dinner as a kind of date. We had a really nice time, we kissed once, but we didn't go further. We both realise this is a complex situation and want to take things slowly. I can't help feeling that I'm irretrievably an asshole, though. Am I?



Ultimately, we do have feelings for each other and have for some time - I would absolutely never have dated her for revenge or for any other reason, and I would never do anything to hurt or upset her. I understand if you still think I'm the/an asshole, but I'm trying my best?","NTA I mean your ex would be kind of an idiot to not at least suspect something might go down with her sister who she knows is living with you after she cheated.

"AITA for not watching my sisters animals while she leaves the city?. Ok, I am pregnant and on bed rest for medical reasons (threatened miscarriage) and I was instructed to rest rest REST. My sister asked me to check on her animals because she was leaving for the night. I thought, ok, just once because she’s only gone for the night. Surely I will be ok. She lives next door. But I just found out that she’s leaving until next Monday (since Tuesday) and she expects me to do this daily, unpaid and risking my health. I also cannot clean animal feces because of the pregnancy, and she is well aware that I mentioned this before. 

She gave me no warning that she would be gone for this long. I told her it was irresponsible that she left them all alone and didn’t get a qualified dog sitter to check on them because I am not in the right situation to care for animals. I keep my medication on my bed with me along with water, and I only get up for food and restroom breaks. I feel I am in no position to help. She thinks I’m being selfish because when I left for college, my mom no longer wanted to take care of my cat and left her outside, or sometimes with my sister. So she believes that because she took care of my cat while I was away, I should do this for her. But I paid her for her taking care of my cat and made sure I paid for food for BOTH of our cats, not just mine. So I can’t see how she can expect me to take care of 3 animals everyday unpaid when I’m on bed rest and equate it to her taking in my cat, which I paid for. 

She keeps saying “you agreed to doing it” and “quit bitching” but I agreed under the initial circumstances. I agreed thinking she would be gone for one night. Now she is saying, “fine, only check one day” but now, if something happens to the animals, I’ll feel like it’s my fault for not checking daily and I’ll never hear the end of it. Also, I have to leave for college before she even gets back, so there would be no way I can even physically be there for the animals. (For info, I take online classes and my only physical classes are 2 short classes Tuesday and Thursday. I moved dorms entirely to get close to these buildings to avoid lengthy walks to keep the baby safe. I have given myself a schedule with 5 days off entirely). I feel so bad because the animals deserve better and it’s not their fault. I’m not trying to avoid feeding or taking care of them out of spite or pettiness. Our dad (her landlord) tore into her for leaving the dog alone every weekend (the dog shits everywhere and no one is there to clean it) so she has been told several times never to leave without the dog again, but she continues to do it and either gets someone nearby and convenient to check on them unpaid, or she just has no one to check on them and does it anyway.

"WIBTA for not hiring someone based on the fact that they were awful to me in high school. I recently got promoted and am in charge of hiring a whole new team. I’ve been doing interviews all week and I have a woman coming in tomorrow who I just realized was my high school ‘bully’ for lack of a better term. She has a different last name now so when I called her for an interview I didn’t realize who she was, and I only used my first name when I called her to set it up. I have been looking potential candidates up on LinkedIn and Facebook and when I found her profile I instantly recognized her. 

I was a year older than all the people in my grade because I started kindergarten late, not because I got held back or anything, but this girl told everyone it was because I was stupid and couldn’t pass my classes. She would also make fun of my hair and clothes and say I was going to die a virgin and stuff like that, and that my only friends were the anime characters I would draw (ok I did have a little bit of an anime phase but I didn’t like go over the top and do the Naruto run or anything and I got over it pretty quick, I just appreciated the artwork and still do). She also interrupted me while I was asking a girl to the prom and told her she could do better. Just dumb shit like that. 

It didn’t scar me for life or anything but she definitely made me feel like shit about myself a lot of the time and luckily I pretty much forgot about her once we all graduated and went off to college. I know she might have changed but I just don’t see myself working with and managing someone who was so rude to me all the time. 

And as tempting as it would be to have her come in and lord it over her during the interview that I’m not gonna hire her, I won’t do that because that’s petty and unprofessional.

I joined the team in February and mostly everyone was really nice and welcoming however for one woman my mere presence seems to fuck her off. I honestly can not recall what I ever did or said to cause such a reaction but it makes my working life rather awkward.

Despite attempts to make amends I have been met with silence, cold hard stares and bitching behind my back in my ear shot. I try to not let this bother me until today.

At this point I should point out I am technically the most senior person in the office and therefore responsible for patient care. My colleague who is a role below me (not that it ever matters apart from legally) states there is not trained staff present and therefore we can not help them, hangs up. I sit utterly shocked that 1) she bluntly ignored the fact I was senior than her at the time and 2) that we couldn’t even give them advice which is a lie because if she actually handed the phone to me I could of helped.

"AITA for getting annoyed when my boyfriend grabs my belly?. My boyfriend (24 M) likes to make a point of grabbing onto any areas of excess fat on my (23 F) body including arm flab and, most commonly, my belly. 

I have put on a bit of weight in the past year and, unfortunately, most of it has gone to my stomach. Since this has happened, I have found that my boyfriend likes to grab, touch and jiggle it. While he is doing so he often laughs and remarks that he thinks that it’s cute. I should note that, when I complain, he says that I am beautiful and he loves my body, he just thinks my fat is cute and funny.

I have asked him to stop several times, especially when we are in public (like when he grabbed it today while we were on a walk) and he often apologises but then does it again. I do not think he means it maliciously, he just doesn’t understand why it makes me self conscious! 

Additionally, when we were on a trip recently a man on the tram offered me his seat. We could only assume that he thought I was pregnant!

"AITA for not watching my brother is law’s daughter?. My sister in law and I are both about 8 months pregnant, being just a few weeks apart. I’ve had a complicated pregnancy so I went on an extended leave from work, leaving me at home much of the day. I watch my brother and sister in law’s daughter frequently and free of charge, usually at a last moments notice. 

Their daughter (9) is a very sweet and intelligent girl. She’s very curious and inquisitive to the point of even being nosy and sometimes snarky/judgmental. She will interrupt a conversation between adults to ask a question about the conversation or input her opinion. This can sometimes be frustrating but she’s never reprimanded for it and always obliged. I still had my Christmas tree up on the 3rd of this month and she walked into house without greeting saying “you’re lazy Auntie, why is your tree up?!”. She’s over heard me paying a bill on the phone and as soon as I hung up she asked “who was that on the phone? why did you pay your bill late?”.  I grew up kind of old fashioned, I would have been told it was rude to ask those kind of questions and better to stay in a child’s place. My beliefs aside, I always patiently answer her questions and let her wedge herself into my personal business. Yesterday, I caught her watching youtube on her phone, which is strictly a NO NO mandated by her parents, when I asked her why she would do that she said “well, they watch youtube so I should be able to watch it.” I explained that they were adults and she was a child, therefore they don’t have to abide by the same rules. She doesn’t seem to understand that she is a child and not equal to an adult.

On to the issue today. At around 8am, her mother texted me asking to watch their daughter at noon because they have a prenatal appointment for an ultrasound and don’t want to leave her sitting in the waiting room for 2 hours. I expressed that I have an appointment with my attorney at 1pm. Her mom said “oh it’s fine, you can just let her wait in the waiting room”. I suggested that they allow their daughter to go to the appointment with them and instead of her waiting in the waiting room, she be able to see the ultrasound and hear the baby, ect. My sister in law said she doesn’t want their daughter in the ultrasound room because she will interrupt and just be her normal, snarky self. My appointment is only about an hour or so but I feel like if her parents don’t want to be subjected to her behavior they need to adjust it and not pawn her off on me.

Am I the asshole for refusing to take her to my appointment?

Edit: I see a lot of people saying I and the family are wrong for discounting her inquisitive nature. This is not the case at all.

"AITA for not wanting a relationship with my father?. Tldr: my dad cheated on my.mom and I told him if he has a relationship with the woman he cheated on her with, I don't want a relationship with him. 

This is a really long story, and since there's a limit I'll keep it brief. My dad cheated on my mom. We found out back in the end of June. We don't know at that point if he was only emotionally cheating or if the receipt from the hotel meant he actually met up with her. My mom listened to him and agreed to give him another chance (I saw another as I said this is a long story and this was one of many chances). 

I wrote my dad a long letter at the time and basically said ""listen if you want to leave mom, do it but don't cheat. I don't care of you leave and then start a relationship, but if you leave mom for this woman you're cheating on her with, I want nothing to do with you, you won't be invited to my wedding (I'm engaged), and you'll never meet any kids I have.""

I did this because the woman he's been cheating on her with is also married and has also been harassing my mom (she called her at work from different numbers so my mom wouldn't know not to answer, taunting her and telling her she was a dumb fucking bitch). She's evil and if my dad wants to be with her I want nothing to do with either of them.

Well we found out they're still talking. My mom called me in tears and shit hit the fan cause I called the other woman's husband and told him. She now he's leaving her. My mom kicked my dad out and I used to do paperwork for my dad's business. My dad has been sucking up to me to do more work. I laid it down for him last night and reminded him that I only would if he wasn't with the other woman.

My dad told me I was fucking selfish and that he guess he wouldn't talk to me any more. 

He began calling my mom and brother and sister and trying to gaslight them and harrass them. He told my mom I'm a selfish bitch. 

Am I an asshole for not wanting a relationship with him if he's with the other woman?","Honey, this story made my night. I'm glad your POS man-child of a dad is finally getting some of what he deserves 😂👌

"AITA for calling the police on a drunk woman. Earlier this month a woman came into our store in search of buying a new phone. As we started small talk trying to ask open ended questions to get her to tell us why she was upgrading, in order to help find a good phone for her, we noticed some very odd things she would say. Unlike the average phone upgrade, Jane had recently purchased an expensive phone just 2 months prior to her visit. Facing a 1000$ buyout, we tried to start convincing her that upgrading wouldn’t be worth it. She then tells us that she doesn’t remember where she put her phone at all and would just like to go ahead and do the buyout because it was starting to anger her. 

As my coworker is processing everything for the device buyout, I walk with her to show her different phones she could upgrade to. I started with the cheaper Samsung A10e phone because I felt terrible that she already is spending 1000$ just to upgrade her phone, so I figured helping her cost is the human thing to do. She then asks me what I personally like, and why. I’m a huge fan of Apple so I begin talking about the iphone 11s to which she would constantly interrupt me by yelling “Apple boy” followed by completely unrelated questions

She wasn’t necessarily violent or aggressive, but rather not all there. As I walk her over to the Apple displays she gets within 2 feet of me and that’s when I noticed she absolutely reeks of alcohol. Not like beer or anything, but straight up liquor.

I am texting my coworker that she smells like liquor. At the same time I noticed that there are only 3 cars in the parking lot. Mine, my coworkers, and an unknown car that I think she walked out of. My coworker then asks who owns the car because she really likes it. Jane says it’s hers, but then quickly starts laughing and asks me (Apple boy) when I can set up her phone. 

My coworker presses Jane for more information such as “who drove you here” which was replied by I drove myself. Jane then asked to use the restroom and wabbles to the back almost falling twice. We decided to call the police 

I then went outside and contacted the non emergency hotline and they had sent a unit out. Less that 5 minutes later an officer shows up. the officer confronts her just as Jane is leaving and opens the drivers door. Unable to hear the convo, we see her preform a sobriety test, followed by a breathalyzer. We then see her put in cuffs and into the car. 

The officers came back in with whiteness statement papers and informed us she was three times the legal limit, this is her third dui, and that she has violated her probation. After the earlier convo we had the customer had mentioned that she was a single mother with kids. 

After I have had conflicting thoughts on reporting her, because if I could go back I wish I could have called a family member or someone to get her. She said she was a single mother to young children also. I feel terrible because of my call I could possibly have her kids taken away or caused some awful consequences","NTA entirely.

"AITA for reporting a steward for pressuring me to swap seats on an airplane?. Shortly after boarding for a 2 1/2 hour flight home, I was approached by a steward who asked me if would mind swapping seats with another passenger.

I asked where his seat was, and he told me that it was about 8 rows back and a middle seat.

I told him that I'd prefer not to, since I was in an aisle seat and had paid extra (not much, about $20) for the ""economy plus"" section that gave me additional leg room.

The steward said that is why he wanted to swap seats, the other passenger was taller than I.

I mentioned that regardless, I had paid for the extra leg room and booked early to get the aisle seat.

He responded that he'd give me some free drinks to make up for it to which I replied, no thank you, buy I don't drink.  

He continues to push me on it saying how uncomfortable the other passenger would be.  Finally the pressure, and frankly the slight embarrassment of this continued conversation / confrontation got the best of me and I gave in.

I was pretty steamed the whole ride, and when I got home I called the airline and complained about the situation and about the steward, by name.

In retrospect I feel a bit bad.  What I should have done was just said stood my ground and stuck with the ""no"" or just been gracious and swapped with the other guy.  (He was about 6'6"" and I'm a bit under 6'.)

"AITA for making major changes after getting married.. Little back history: I was a vegetarian from the time I was 13 till I was about 19 year old. I started eating meat due to pressure from multiple in my life at the time. I originally went vegetarian after watching a video on KFC and their treatment of the chickens as well as my community involvement with animal shelters. 

Throughout the years I didn’t eat much meat, till over the last year or 2 my current husband wants meat every single meal. And I feel like complete shit mentally and physically from it. 

Well 2 weeks ago I told my husband I am going back vegetarian, he wasn’t happy at all he said that I am changing our lives and that’s not fair to him. To make him feel like I’m not changing everything I went out and bought him a meat pack when I bought everything I need for my meal.  He still says that I am being ridiculous that we as people are suppose to eat meat not just vegetables and beans. I had him watch the documentary that changed my views all those years ago and he played on his phone the whole time and asked well how did you expect them to kill and animal. 

My husband feels that I am changing so much and that he fell in love with who I was.

"AITA for telling someone I don't care about their engagement?. I'll keep this short and sweet. My coworker( who I'll call K) got engaged this may to a guy she's been dating since highschool. (Both are 20) Plan is they're going to get married in the may or June of 2020. She's had every weekend off since I started this job, while I haven't had one for 3+ months. I rely on getting Saturdays off so I can use my campus shuttle, because I have no car. Recently, I was given two Saturdays off. One to work another coworkers(M) wedding by babysitting, and another to do as a pleased. I get a call my first Saturday off, with K asking if I can take her two hour shift, I say no I'm working other coworkers wedding. She gets huffy and hangs up. 

Whatever. I go into my place of work for a drink and I overhear her saying that not having a Saturday off is putting strain on her relationship. She sees her fiance every day. Next Saturday rolls around. She calls me at 6 am twice till I pick up. K begs me to work for her because she has wedding planning to do, and that I helped with M's wedding. Yes, I did. I took her shift when there was a mixup with some catering business, but that was the Tuesday before her wedding. K says she needs this day, (current Saturday) to plan with her fiance. I tell her no, I have plans. I hang up. She calls back 13+ times before 12, sends a crap ton of messages that I don't know how stressful an wedding can be because I'm single now, and I am unsupportive of her engagement, and cause unnecessary stress because I just won't give in. Then she proceeds to say a wedding gift of working her wedding for babysitting would be nice, for free. I didn't even do M's for free, and i actually like her. After her ringing me again, I said, I didn't care that she got engaged and I don't thinking working two Saturdays is going to shatter her relationship, and I'm not picking up her shifts for her again. K then told me I should pick up her shifts anyway, because it's not like I have friends or plans because I'm single.

I play League of legends a lot. I like the game and I like the competitive side of it. So I play ranked. I’m not really good at the game but average (gold 1). I really want to improve so I take the matches I play seriously. 

My friend also plays league (not as much as me) and she also likes ranked. The problem is she doesn’t take it seriously and shes not as good. (Silver 3 [I know Im not so much better than her but she usually loses her matchup and makes some questionable decisions in game]) 

I used to play with her a lot and enjoyed it. But she stopped playing. She came back after a few months and went straight into ranked. I thought
It was a bad decision but wanted to play with her anyway. I just didn’t want my main account to lose points I grinded for. So I hopped on to my second account and played a game with her.

After the game she messaged me saying how pissed she was because I played with my second account. I told her I was grinding solo on my main account but if it was a really big deal I could go on my main. She replied saying “If you’re grinding solo keep doing that” and went on playing without me.

"AITA for not wanting to pay for my friends to use my Netflix after having done so for a few years?. I am going to try to keep this brief, and if anyone has questions I’ll be glad to clarify. 

Up until recently (the last month or so) I had been paying for Netflix‘s four screens and Ultra HD tier for a few years. During this time, two of my friends had also been using my account. Myself and one of them agreed it was not necessary for either of them to pay for their access because when we hung out, we’d always split costs on other things like food or drink or weed or whatever else. Netflix raised prices two, perhaps three times during this time. Most recently, Netflix’s price went up to $15.99 for the tier described above.

When this latest price hike occurred, I notified the friends who had been using the account that I would be downgrading in order to save money. As a result, they would no longer get Ultra HD quality, and it would only be shared among two screens and not the previous four. As an alternative, I asked for direct monetary compensation instead of the previously stated splitting of costs.

One of them took this rather harshly. They reminded me of the agreement to split the costs described above. To which I responded by stating that I wasn’t interested in splitting those costs anymore and that I would pay my way when it came to that. 

I was accused by the upset party of throwing away the friendship after I suggested that I’d pay for my part in things that we would shared in the future.

I think I am NTA because I made my wants clear. As a result the friendship with the two individuals I’ve described has now ended. I am wondering if anything I have explained here colors me as TA.

He is clearly under the influence under some sort of drugs 4/5 times he comes in from his pupil size to his behavior and mannerisms. He is either really excited and enthusiastic about everything or won't say a word to you. 

The other day his father came in and put 10 dollars on a pump for him. His father was really nice and soft mannered. He left, and in walks his son. This is pretty much how it went.

"AITA about getting my girlfriend a promise ring and not telling my parents until after I gave it to her?. My gf (F19) and I (M19) just got back from a vacation with my friends. On this trip I gave her a promise ring. Her and I both thought that since we have been dating for a little over a year now and we have a lot in common it would be nice to have something to show how strong our relationship is. So we talked about a promise ring and what it meant to us. It basically boiled down to us promising not to cheat on each other, to work out any of our disagreements like adults when they came around, and to do the best we can in making our relationship last. 

Now my parents are extremely conservative Christians when it comes to relationship stuff and I had talked to my mom about promise rings hypothetically in the past and she said they were dumb and a waste of money. She sees them as a cheap engagement ring. My parents whenever I try bringing ideas (like a promise ring or spending a day and one night supervised at her grandparents house) up about my relationship with my gf they always shut me down by saying you’re too young and your relationship is hardly serious. 

I tend to think differently in a lot of places than my parents and I disagree with them saying my relationship with my gf isn’t serious.

"AITA for refusing to be at “family” Christmas and scheduling a separate time entirely to avoid my sister?. Me (23f) and my sister (25f) have been on the outs since I was 18 years old for something that was technically my fault, but not really. If necessary I can give the back story on that, but for simplicity sake I will say I have tried NUMEROUS times to extend the olive branch to her to reconcile any hurt or misunderstanding and she has NOT been receptive. 

Now before my sister had her son in September we were able to be in the same room and make VERY small talk, not great but it was manageable.

I saw her and her son for the first time on Thanksgiving and I immediately walked up and started commenting on how cute her baby was. I wasn’t touching him, I wasn’t grabbing for him, just babbling at him like anyone does to a newborn. IMMEDIATELY my sister picks the baby up with a huff and an eye roll and leaves the room. Okay, whatever maybe she had to feed him or something. I’m a mom, babies are stressful, No big deal so I thought. 

About ten minutes later my younger sister (19f) comes to me and tells me “Sister just told me not to let you anywhere near her baby”. 

Once I heard that I was HURT. I am a mom. I have a 15 month old, and I’m pregnant with my second. I have NEVER given anyone any reason at all to believe that I am any sort of threat to any child. As a mother I can’t imagine telling anyone that is enjoying and loving my children they aren’t allowed around them. They’re humans, not my property. 

After hearing that I talked to my mother and told her I’m not willing to be at Christmas at the same time as my sister if she is going to ice me out and treat me like I’m subhuman. She initially agreed to having us over a few hours before that way we don’t have to be here at the same time, but now she is backpedaling and calling me trying to convince me to swallow my pride and just be the bigger person because christmas is my moms favorite day of the year and we have a lot of family traditions.

So far I’ve told her flat out no. I’ve tried being the bigger person and it doesn’t work and I’m tired of spending holidays feeling her glaring into the back of my head. It’s just exhausting and I want to enjoy the day, not dread it. But I’m starting to feel guilt because my mother keeps telling me how important it is to her to have all of her kids and grandkids under the same roof and I understand where she is coming from, but would I be the asshole for saying no officially and ruining my moms Christmas over my sisters actions?


Edit to add info about original beef with sister:

We were both gifted cars when we were 16 (old beaters) When I was 18 I wrecked my car not looking over my shoulder a second time before turning.

It just so happened our grandmother had passed away a week before that and she had passed her car down (like new) to my sister. So she had 2 cars, and I totaled mine so I was screwed in the car department. Our beater cars were in our dads name so I asked my sister if I could drive her beater around while I was out a vehicle. She said no which was completely unreasonable and not her call so I went to our dad and he forced her to give me the keys. Eventually he transferred the title of her old beater to me and she got really mad at me for stealing “her” car because she wanted to sell it for money for a vacation.

She has NEVER forgiven me even though I’ve tried talking to her time and time again. It gets me nowhere.

It all seems so petty and I’m sooooo tired of it carrying on. I’m just ready for it to be over one way or the other.



","Jesus, your sister is so painfully petty. NTA

In the first place, she was very unreasonable with the car. She does not need two, and it wasn't even hers in the first place. If she wanted that money so much, she could have asked you or your dad for it and be done. The fact, that she is *still* pissed over a non-issue after so many years, says a lot about her. Not to mention, that you tried to make up many times. She is just ridiculous. And in the first place, it was your dad who decided to give you the car. If anyone, she should be pissed at him.

What's worse, is that she is involving a little baby in the issue, who has absolutely nothing to do with it. It makes me angry as hell, when parents manipulate their children into disliking someone because the parents don't like that person. Especially if it's a family member who had done nothing wrong to the kid. This is really unhealthy for the child's mental health.

I can understand your Mom, she wants everyone to get along, but she has her priorities wrong. She should be making sure, that your sister behaves (and this includes no glares or passive-agressive bs), instead of forcing you to endure it. If she wants people to get along, the source of the disturbance should be dealt with, which is your sis. IMO, it should be your sis who gets booted from the get together - she can just visit at another time if she has the maturity of a bratty five year old and doesn't know how to behave like an adult.

Apparently they lock their small dog outside and it just doesn't stop barking and howling all day (at least 6-8 hours, starting in the morning at 6am, even on the weekends) and only stops when they come back home or bring it inside.

It's really annoying, to say the least. The problem is they're not listening to complaints, they think it's perfectly fine to lock their dog out the whole day. We tried to talk to them.

"AITA for not taking my grandma to the social security office, possibly resulting in her losing her social security?. I’m going to try to keep it short as possible.

My grandma is crazy. She’s kicked me out multiple times when I was younger (12-13 years old, was homeless from age 11-16 and I’d stay place to place). I don’t hold that as a grudge, but she’d always have an ill will towards me because of my mother.

"AITA for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Basically I [M42] got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""Andy, Sara, Kate"". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now.

The problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads ""Andy"" and not ""Athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now.

"WIBTA for not wanting Mickey invited for my birthday?. Posting this for my wife because she doesn’t have an account but would like your input:


So my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks and my mom wants to do something to celebrate, as mothers do, but I’m finding myself feeling increasingly harassed by the prospect for many reasons and part of me feels like an ungrateful asshole, but the other part of me thinks I have some good points, and I think I need outside perspective: 


My birthday is on a Sunday and my mom is busy that weekend so Friday night is what accommodated our schedules. I drive an hour North to work every day, and my mom lives due south of me on the other side of a major city center.  On a Friday night, that’s probably another hour drive to her place, and after checking the sports schedule, a game is happening that night so potentially even longer. I tried to think of a meeting place partially between us, but she wants to cook…

I have IBS, it’s not super bad and I manage it well, to the point that I don’t really think of it on a daily basis...that is until someone tries to feed me things that I can’t eat.  And my specific triggers are really what I’m going to call ‘shortcut’ ingredients, as in my body’s mortal enemy is the anti-caking agents on pre-chopped vegetables and whatever keeps dairy shelf stable.  My mom struggles to understand this, not out of malice but I don’t want to spend my birthday weekend on the toilet. Or my fourth hour long stint in the car that day stuck in traffic while needing a toilet.  

My mom’s condo apparently has a horrible mice problem, apparently the other day one managed to eat some food that she left IN her oven.  And my dad has repeatedly seen mice on the kitchen counter. Just chillin there. That’s really gross to me. I wouldn’t consider myself a germaphobe, but I wouldn’t eat at a restaurant where mice had been spotted on the food preparation surfaces, so why is the rule different here?  She just got a new cat and that cat catches multiple mice per day and leaves their parts around the apartment, which, not my favorite ambiance, necessarily.  


So I guess my question is “Am I the asshole for perceiving my usually wonderful mom’s attempt to make a fuss for my birthday as an invitation to be stuck in traffic for hours before eating something Jerry tried to snatch off a counter while Tom was busy butchering the cast of An American Tail in the other room?”  Like is this in the realm of “your family is trying to love you, suck it up and be grateful” or not?",NTA it’s your birthday and your mother is making it very complicated to only accommodate her.

He ditched me at party that he brought me to as a plus one to get laid (and will occasionally just get up and leave in the middle of hanging out bc he planned something else without mentioning). Then that same night asked me to come pick him up bc I guess things weren’t going well. Complained when I said I was drunk and couldn’t be of any help. 

He continues to be not emotionally supportive or understanding. When I was having a bad day & we were supposed to hang out, he opted to cancel if I was gonna “be like that” as in not being in a good mood. 

Anytime I would tell him things I didn’t appreciate (for example flaking on plans with no texts or calls to cancel) he just threatens to bring up past things I have done wrong in the friendship.

Ever since he started learning, he has not stopped playing the same two songs he knows. I have told him countless of times to either to stop or to play solely in his room with his door closed as it was frankly getting annoying and disrupting even my work (i work freelance).

"AITA for taking a trip my boss didnt deny?. Summary at bottom. 

So where I work you can put as many time off requests as youd like in the earlier you put them in the more likely you'll get approved. Even though corporate policy says you cant ask for time off further than 2 weeks out. Now I've taken a lot of trips while working there, I learned a month in advance is a great time frame to put the request in. 

Now the situation I'd like to be judged on. I got invited on this sweet multi day trip going from 9/29-10/3. I put the time off request in 3.5 weeks before I was set to leave. I asked my boss if he saw my new time off request and he said ""yes I did, I'll get to it tomorrow"". He never got to it. So the day comes and he hasn't approved or denied it so I went on my trip. I did this because hes done this to me before. Way back in April my mother was having major neck surgery and I gave him 3 months notice for 2 days off. He just left it pending until after I had paid someone to cover my shifts and until I was already back from the surgery. 

So I get back to town and my coworkers are telling me he was losing his shit all Monday and Tuesday. Luckily someone told him we are both at fault (which agree with to some extent). Apparently he talked to HR about the situation. Then he denied my time off request on the last day of my trip! I havent had a meeting with him yet but I'm pretty angry about the situation.

"WIBTA for not sharing my bitcoin with a friend?. Throwaway obviously. 

So back in 2015 I read about bitcoin in an article and decided to dabble in it out of curiosity. I bought three bitcoins off of a now-defunct exchange when they were trading for about $250 each. I only told one person, a good buddy of mine at the time, and because I was feeling unusually generous that day, I said, “You know what, man, if these are ever worth anything, I’ll give you one of the coins,” figuring maybe they’d double or triple in price at most. He was skeptical but said sure.

I had my private key written on a sheet of paper, and like the total idiot I am, I managed to lose it a few weeks later when I moved into a new apartment. I was kicking myself for it but didn’t really feel like buying more bitcoin so I just mentally chalked it up as a loss and mostly forgot about it until the price really took off two years later. My friend reached out to me around that time to say it was really unfortunate that I’d lost the key and that we both could have made a ton of money (I guess he remembered that I’d offered to give him a bitcoin). Not going to lie, I was pretty depressed for a while, but eventually I got over it.

The other day, I was going through some of my old books out of boredom and to my total shock I found the paper wedged between two pages of a copy of a scifi novel I was reading around the time I bought the bitcoin. I swear to God my heart stopped in that moment. Right now, the coins are collectively worth just under $28,000 — an amount of money that would make a huge difference to me right now. 

My friend moved to another state about a year and a half ago, and we’ve drifted apart a lot since then. I’d say we’re more acquaintances than friends at this point, and I haven’t talked to him in nearly nine months. Considering this, I’m a little reluctant to call him and tell him I found the key and basically give away $9,300. I honestly didn’t think it would EVER be worth this much when I bought it.

I did not hear much from my parents aside from occassional visits (because my dad often asks money from my grandma) until I finished my degree, all of a sudden they are more “involved” with me — giving me a ride to work, texting me, etc.

"WIBTA if I straight up told my boyfriend I need my OWN space away from him and his daughter when he has her over?. My boyfriend and I have been dating for well over a year and I knew that he had a 6 year old daughter upfront. For the most part, the agreement he has with her mother is that he gets her every weekend. Since moving in together, that means she comes to our apartment during those days.

When she's over, I have NO personal space. Her and my boyfriend trash the place. Every room is a mess, wet towels are left on the floor, the dishes are left to pile up and he feeds her whatever she wants, including bottomless ice cream and sweets. He doesn't set any rules for her, in terms of bedtime, cleaning up after herself or respecting boundaries (like knocking on doors). Granted, I've never had or cared for a child but I feel like by age 6, these are lessons they'd begin to learn. But all of these things bother me a lot because I have extreme OCD, anxiety and depression, which my partner is aware of. I physically cannot stand the mess.

To top it all off, they never leave the apartment for the entire weekend she's here. He picks her up Friday and they do not leave again until he drops her off with her mom on Sunday. When I try to suggest him taking her to the park, or to a matinee, he argues that he doesn't want to ""spend all the time he has with her driving around.""

I basically feel like it forces me out of the apartment so I can be alone.

"WIBTA if I asked my dental assistant to stop bringing up her dead brother with patients?. Let me just preface this by saying I think I'm in a lose lose situation.

My dental assistants brother died unexpectedly about a month and a half ago. She got two weeks bereavement leave and took some personal time. I have no problems with this since I honestly think I would be an absolute wreck if I lost anyone in my immediate family. Also the office made sure to make the time as easy as possible for her and even purchased a meal service for a week so she didn't have to cook.

However, since she has started working again she has brought it up with easily over three quarters of our patients when having small talk. The assistant does alot of things when I'm not around such as impressions, getting the op ready/setting up instruments, taking xrays. For some reason everytime I come to start working I walk in on her telling the patients about her brothers death.

She recently got a tattoo in memory of her brother and this has been exacerbating the problem since alot of patients comment on it since its visible. I try to keep office energy high for both patients and staff but after the dead brother talk its pretty quiet and subdued. So far it hasn't affected business but I do like to keep things light.

It just makes me uncomfortable let alone I can't imagine how the patient feels since they are just meeting the assistant for the first time. I'm not sure how to bring this up or even if I should. I'm damned if I do because its a difficult conversation to tell someone to stop mentioning their dead brother to every patient. And if I do nothing the awkwardness and unease of the patients continues.

I understand she is feeling heartbroken and unbelievable loss. But there are inappropriate ways to grieve. It isn't the patients duty nor mine to be an outlet for her grief.

"AITA for telling my boyfriends sister that she couldn’t tag along?. Alright so my boyfriend (19M) and me (18f) have been together for about 6 months. His sister is (16f). She’s homeschooled so she’s always home whenever my boyfriend invites me over. She always makes an effort to talk to me( which I’m completely fine with because she is very sweet and makes me feel less awkward then sitting in silence) I’m very shy so it takes me awhile to warm up to people. If I take my bfs dogs outside she comes with me. Overall she is very welcoming and I appreciate how she goes out of her way to make me feel at home. Yesterday I was hanging with them, waiting for my friend to pick me up to go shopping. She eventually gets there and comes in to get me. As we were getting ready to go his sister says “Hey could I maybe come with you guys?” I told her no in the nicest way possible. She stopped smiling and just nodded. I felt like a douche and told my BF that I felt bad. He said not to worry about it and that she was just a little disappointed. I completely understand why. She’s homeschooled and home alone all day. She has no friends at all. I’m the only friend she has. My friend that picked me up is extremely anxious and shy and doesn’t like new people very much. I feel like such an asshole.",NAH. I totally get why you’d feel bad but that doesn’t make it your fault. Maybe sometime just you and her could go shopping so she could see it wasn’t just because you don’t like her?

"AITA For refusing to pick my ex up in his car because I need it for my Valentine's date.. Back story:

My ex and I are still living together, divorce pending. He works away most of the week and I have the car. We only have one car because of the fact he was always away and it seemed pointless to have two cars. Since we broke up I've picked him up from 15 minutes away or 1 hour away, once or twice a week (UK so this is a long distance for us) and taken him back at sometimes 5am in the morning if he comes home mid-week. This is so that I can have the car.

Issue:

He is of the opinion I shouldn't make plans on Thursday (valentines) because he needs picking up.

It is his car (which technically it is) however, and here's the kicker, he wants to buy our house (joint names atm). I can't get a car because his credit will be affected. So, I am unable to get a car until that is sorted. It's valentines and I have a date 50 minutes away, my date hs only just started driving like two weeks ago and doesn't feel comfortable driving that far yet which is understandable. I have to leave before he gets home to avoid evening traffic, so I can't pick him up beforehand (which I have explained to my ex and he just gets annoyed).

My ex can have his father pick him up (15 minutes away) he's retired but has recently has gallstones and I know my ex doesn't want to bother him but there is also a taxi option. My ex will not use the car Thursday night he'll go home and play Xbox, (he doesn't need/won't use the car).

Additionally, when he comes home on a weekend so Friday and Saturday this weekend, he will take the car and not consult me on it at all. It leaves me stranded in a city with dire public transportation or taxis(expensive) which I have never bitched about. I get it, it's his car but I made plans and he has alternative options for this one night.

EDIT: Our finances were joint, my money went into that car too, it's just his name on the title and he's keeping it in the divorce.

"AITA for looking at my girlfriend's texts to find out the truth. Made a throwaway for reasons. But to preface, me and my girlfriend, who I will call C, have been together roughly 6 years at this point and are at the point marriage and kids is just around the corner after we are finished getting our degrees. We have had a pretty solid relationship to the point that I already call her mom ""mom"" and she is already loved and accepted by my family as well. Everyone jokes around about ""how long til y'all are married yet?"" 

So she has this friend she had grown up with til she was around 10 give or take a year or two and had been pretty close with him on and off as a family friend we will call him J. Well, I already had some suspicion about this summer such as her suddenly being busy when I was supposed to come visit or her suddenly going out of town. She had told me a few times she was planning on going and visiting a friend she had made in her sorority like group who we will call E which she actually did so my suspicion lessened over a month or so and everything seemed very normal and happy. I spent this past weekend helping her move across town closer to her University and spent a good majority of two days doing so. 

So the reason I made this post is I had to help set up her WiFi at her new place and it required having the Mac address of each device added. No big deal. Well when she let me add her phone I couldn't help but notice she had fucking tinder downloaded dead center of a bunch of other apps on her phone. So it was very obvious she wasn't trying to hide anything. And since that rose my suspicion higher than it's ever been, she had left her phone in the bathroom when I went to take a shower this morning and we are very open and neither one of us get mad if the other needs to use the others phone for texting and calling people. So I locked the door and went through her texts and found that not only had she been texting her friend J for around 5 months as far as I could tell. Not only had she been texting him, she had been texting her best friend E as well and the texts read as if I was Cs ex and we haven't been together for years. Yet I've even met E at a party and was introduced to her as Cs boyfriend. 

So the main question is, AITA for looking at my girlfriend's texts to see she's been cheating and sleeping with her ""friend"" for months and has been telling her best friend the entire time as if I don't exist. 

I really am lost for what to do here. I haven't confronted her about it yet, I've been taking my time processing everything so I don't explode and behave irrationally. I just really don't know how to take the news. 

TL;DR- looked at my girlfriend of 6 years' phone and found out she had been hooking up with some guy from her childhood all summer and acts with her best friend as if I don't exist in her life, yet is as close as ever with me and keeps me involved in family matters and what not.","NTA - people can say what they want about snooping.

"AITA for getting mad at a parent after their child came running toward my dog. Not a long story but there’s an outdoor outlet mall near my house and I usually bring my dog there during the summer. Dogs are allowed at the mall if they’re on a leash and don’t go inside the store.

He’s very anxious and I’m trying to acclimate him around people. I thought this was a good way since he’s on the leash near me and there’s usually a ton of people walking around. 

Usually I’ll sit on the bench and let him sit on the ground and just let him chill out and watch people go by.  People do go up to me and ask if they can pet him and I say that he’s anxious so he’ll probably bark at them. Most people understand this and they will either walk away or crouch down and let him sniff their hand. 

Today was particularly busy since it’s back to school season. I see a parent and her child is running around bumping into people and the mom is just on her phone not caring and letting her kid (probably around 6/7) run around crazy. Anyway this kid comes charging at my dog and it surprises him and repeatedly barks at the kid. The kid gets scared, falls over and starts to cry. 

The mom finally pays attention to her kid and realized he was crying. She says “Control your stupid dog, look what it did to my kid” and she is just yelling at me calling me irresponsible and stupid. And then she says “You need to train effing your dog” and she’s just keeps getting mad, yelling and cursing at me while her kid is throwing a fit. 

At this point I’m fuming and I finally get a word in and say “You should really pay attention to your kid instead of your phone, this wouldn’t have happened if you actually paid attention and didn’t let him run around like crazy “ This made her even mad and said “I can let my kid do what ever I want I’m his mother” to that I said “Well he’s my dog and he was sitting here calmly until your son spooked him, you should really teach your kids some manners.” Anyway at this point she’s calling me names and yelling at me so I said fuck you have a nice day and walked away. 

My mom saw the whole thing and told me I should’ve just apologized to her. But honestly I don’t think I was in the wrong since my dog and I were just minding our own business.

"AITA for being upset with my roommate for moving out early and asking them to help accommodate me?. My roommate and I are both university students in the same program. We signed a one year lease in October and it will be done at the end of September. However, we had both agreed with each other that we would be staying till at least this December (this is okay as where I live, the lease goes “month to month” once the term is up, you don’t have to move out) because that’s when we’re both graduating. 

However, my roommate’s parents recently moved to the city we are studying in. Their parents have told them to move back home with them once the lease is up, leaving me on the hook until December to pay the rent entirely myself. I don’t have somewhere else to move and there’s no guarantee I can find someone to move in for only 3 months. If I can’t, they’re leaving me on the hook for over $2500 by leaving before our agreed upon time. 

I’m pretty upset with my roommate. They don’t really seem to care that they’ve just thrown this on me.

I haven’t gotten angry with them, but I’m really frustrated right now. I’ve asked if there’s anything they can do to make it work for only 3 more months and they’ve been fairly unresponsive. When I told them that I wasn’t able to afford the place on my own and was frustrated because “I assumed you meant it when you said you’d stay till December” all they told me was “stop”. 

I’ve told them about all the grants / bursaries / work-study programs they can apply to if money is an issue (which they say is the main problem, though if their family hadn’t moved here, they *were* planning on staying). I’ve even offered to take on a larger portion of the rent on top of that. 

I am thinking my next move is going to be to either ask if they can cover *some* of the rent they had agreed upon. Or asking them to vacate the apartment before September 1, as I think I’d have much better luck finding someone to ~~stay~~ sublet / rent the other room from September - December than Oct - Dec.

"AITA for denying physical affection to my mom?. I'm a male in my early/mid 20s, I go to college in the US, but I'm not American. I'm currently back ""home"" with my family, with my dad. Here the culture is very big on physical affection, kisses on the cheek with a hug are the standard greeting and farewell. I am absolutely not big on physical affection. I am autistic, very reserved, and big personal space and autonomy, and depressed, which I've come to realize is partly caused by how my mom treats me.

&#x200B;

I love my mom, and I know she loves me, but I don't appreciate the way she shows affection to me. It makes me uncomfortable, stressed, and feel powerless. Whenever she approaches to kiss my cheek I move my shoulder over to cover my neck, as before I started doing that she'd kiss my neck. This is an extreme no no for me. I'm very sensitive about my neck, it's very intimate to me. Imagine someone greeting you with a grab to the groin, that's how it feels to me. I've been vocal about my discomfort about it, but basically ignored. ""It's because you're too tall so I can't reach your face."" I don't give her the opportunity to anymore.

&#x200B;

I can imagine that if other people saw me cover myself before approaching my mom for a greeting they'd think ""wow, what a piece of shit person, who treats their mom that way?"", but I have tried to reason with her, my dad has tried to reason with her, but she's dead set on her ways. My dad is also very affectionate, he treats my sister very affectionately, but here's the difference, he doesn't treat me that way. Instead he treats me how I like being treated. He'll give me a short verbal greeting and let me have my space and time. My mom gives him a very hard time for that. Demands him to sit with me while I eat. I hate eating with people around. Demands him to take me out to the movies/dinner when I don't want to go. Demands him to force me to do things, to which he replies ""He's an adult, I can't force him to do anything"". I feel that my dad treats me like a person, while my mom treats me like her property in some ways.

&#x200B;

I know this kinda sounds like I'm just ranting, maybe it is a bit, but it ties in. In short, my mom's love and affection towards me are very detrimental to my mental health. I've noticed that I try to avoid spending time with her as much as I can. I've noticed that if she starts walking towards me, or getting closer to me, I'll instinctively recoil back and raise my arms to protect myself and push her away. Just the other day she came to visit me while I was sleeping, she took the opportunity to get in bed with me and cuddle me. I struggled and tried to push her away, but I was too tired to really put up a fight, and I just felt violated and powerless. It felt awful. But I also feel guilty, because I know that I'm not ""normal"", and I don't know if I should be the one adapting to her instead of expecting her to respect my needs, I don't know if I'm just being an asshole by denying her affection.","NTA.

"AITA For avoiding a coworker?. So, I do my best to get along with everyone, and I have a decent work relationship with everyone (work at a gas station for reference). I either work the register, or store side, or the food side. The thing is, if you're on one, you're NOT supposed to do the other. 

This coworker, Angie, is nice enough, but she gets annoying quickly. She has many times come to the food side when I'm working (she exclusively does register, I do both) and just tells me chores to do. The thing is, food side is not responsible for store chores since we have so much of our own to do. I've politely told her I can't because I'm busy, and it's not my responsibility, and she'll huff and walk away. She'll also ask me to go on register while she goes on break even if there is another person there. Again, I'm not allowed on other people's register and I wont have my own if I'm on food side.

On the flip side, if we're both on register, she'll just disappear. There are chores that are given each shift, with 2-3 people to do them and register. I don't mind doing only register, only chores, or a mix as it should be, but she just goes and does the minimum and unnecessary chores,  like tending coffee when we have a person specifically dedicated to coffee. She does them because, in her own words, ""I just cant work hard today"". She is supposed to say where she is in case I get a line, but the manager always has to find her and basically force her to be on register with me when we're busy.

Lastly, she keeps requesting I make her hot food and ring it as cold so she can use food stamps to buy them. I am sympathetic, people need to eat, but it's strictly against the rules and I could get fired. I did it once because she wouldnt stop harassing me, and then I explicitly told her I cant do it again or risk being fired.

I tried telling her my issues with our work relationship and she dismisses me everytime and straight up walks away. Now, I simply ignore her. If shes near register and i have a chore to do, I'll just do it which forces her to work register. She gets very mad because she doesnt like register, and takes it out on customers by being rude. On the flip, if I'm on food side I just ignore her demands for chores by saying ""I'm food side, those are your chores "" and going out of my way not to see her at work. 

Some say I should just let her be her and I'm being mean. I'm not insulting her, telling her what to do, any of that. I'm just doing my job which makes her do hers.

"AITA for thinking my friend shouldn't get another pet?. So my friend loves having pets. She currently has two dogs and two cats. Her frog died two days ago and she's looking to replace it with either another frog or a lizard. I'm not sure she knows the cause of death for the frog and plans to reuse its container for her new pet, which I'm not sure is a great idea if the cause of death is not known. 

She is chronically ill and lives in an abusive situation with a sibling and her mom's boyfriend who both constantly berate her and the brother hits her. Her mom does nothing to help. 

(She's an internet friend and I've suggested calling the cops, especially after the last time her brother beat her, but she claims it's not a possibility because she doesn't have anywhere else to go, has no income, doesn't have access to any sort of birth certificate, ID, etc since her mom has it all and won't hand it over. I don't know what else I can do from a distance.)

She's planning on leaving soon to stay in a hotel or something, but I'm unclear how this will work financially for her and the last thing I think she needs to add while looking for another place to live is another pet, especially when she already has two dogs and two cats she wants to bring with her. She's constantly saving money up for medical treatments and medications and anything to make her more comfortable/feel like she's in less pain, which is understandable, but a new pet would add more unnecessary costs especially because all of her income comes from commissions and she pays for everything pet-related herself. 

Other friends have said I'm extremely insensitive since her pets make her happy and what she needs in her situation is some happiness even if it comes from pets. Which I totally get. My pets make me happy too. But I'm not in the process of trying to escape abusive family with not much of a plan at all and no income.

"AITA for not renting out to a small family. AITA for not renting out my apartment to single moms with a kid because it is too small?

I have recently put up my own 1 bedroom apartment for rent in a bigger European city and have been reading through various application.

"AITA for cutting off my best friend of 10 years after her grandpa’s death?. This is rather long as I feel that some back story is required but I would really appreciate some insight into my situation. 

Posting from a throwaway since she also uses reddit. 
My ex best friend and I had a really great friendship for the past ten years. Like y’know, I thought we’d still be friends until we were 80. 

I do freelance writing and over the past few months, I’d been getting requests for far more work than I could handle. She had just been moved to part-time at her job and needed some extra cash, so she asked if I could assign her some writing work too. I was hesitant as she had previously flaked on a 9000 word project before. 

Regarding the previous incident, I had given her a 3 week deadline and asked every two days how it was coming along, whether she needed help, etc. I had my suspicions that she wasn’t getting as much done as she was letting on, but I thought surely she wouldn’t fuck me up like that. I assured my client that my friend was very responsible and could produce high quality work (and she could, when she wasn’t procrastinating) to which my client agreed to let her take on the project. I’m sure you can see where this is going and sure enough, during my 12 hour (10am to 10pm) shift on the day before it was due, she told me that she couldn’t do it. She sent me 1000 words that I couldn’t even use as she hadn’t even followed the instructions I had given her. 

At the time, she was going through some shit so I decided to just drop it. She was my best friend after all. So when I got home after work that day, I had 10 hours to jam out a 9000 word project. 

Fast forward to the most current incident, I agreed to give her a project which was due in a month from the date of assignment. Again, I asked every single day whether she had started, whether she needed help and told her that she needed to let me know ASAP if she couldn’t finish it. A week before it was due, we had organised for her to come over and we would work on our projects together. 

She had originally stated that she would come at 6pm after work. At 5pm, she messages me and says that she’ll go home to pick up some stuff, then come over afterwards. I had a feeling she wouldn’t come but I had anticipated it earlier on anyway. At 10pm she messages and says that she’s way too tired to come since she’d been at work and that she needed to sleep. 

So now I had about 30,000 words worth of projects to complete by myself within a week. I’m having a full blown meltdown at this point cus I’m aware that I shouldn’t have entrusted her with my stuff.

The next morning, my sister shows me that my friend hadn’t been sleeping but instead went out and got drunk. She uploaded some drunken photos and videos of herself to her Snapchat and it’s at this point I realise that she’d blocked me from seeing them. 

So not only did she flake, she also lied which was a double smack in the face. I really thought of her as my own sister. I tried to just leave it and try to get over it, but ended up blocking and deleting her off everything a week later. She called me to ask me what happened but thought I was kidding around. When I made it clear that I knew she lied and tried to hide it, she immediately says “ok I can’t do this if you’re gonna fight with me cus I’m in the middle of something now”. So I just hung up and we haven’t talked since. 

The reason I’m asking if I’m the asshole is because her grandpa passed away on Christmas Day and I didn’t message or say anything to her. Before our fight, she told me he was very sick and that she was pretty cut up about it. 

Obviously my reasons for cutting her out of my life aren’t limited to this one event, but this seems to be the place where I should draw the line. My work is extremely important to me and it seems like she doesn’t care about my professional reputation or my clients. 

Am I justified in wanting to just cut off all contact with her? Should I have said something about her grandpa? ","NTA, she fucked up simple as.

"AITA for hiding the tv remote?. My bf and I moved into a 250 sq ft apartment. His parents gifted us (mostly him) a 55 in LED TV. Within the first week of living together, I realise the bf needs the TV on at night to sleep. The tv takes up the entire wall in front of the bed.

I suffer from ocular migraines and a big trigger for them are flashing lights and loud noises. They get so bad that I sometimes go blind.

I ask him if its possible for him to turn off the tv every once in a while so I can sleep at night and not wake up with a migraine. He tells me no. That he'll have nightmares if the tv is off. Okay... so I get an eye mask to block out the light from the tv. Nothing improves. So I suggest he use his phone and headphones at night. He tries it for all of 2 hours before the tv comes back on because he's uncomfortable.

After putting up with this for a few months, I came home from work with the worst head pain I've ever had. Take some ibuprofen and it does nothing. Bf leaves for work and I jump at the chance to turn the tv off. Knowing the second he comes home, hes going to turn the TV back on and make my migraine worse, I hid the remote.

He's tearing everything in the apartment apart, slamming things, and turning on the lights to find it. I tell him I have a migraine and dont feel good. He starts complaining about how he cant sleep at night. I ignore him, take some sleeping pills, and fall asleep. Finally. At peace. Until 4 in the morning. He starts looking again.

I waited until it became apparent he was being intentionally impolite, probably 3.5 or 4 minutes, and went to a lady working at a Korean restaurant next to the shawarma place and ordered a coffee. 

She said I had to ask Him for a coffee and pointed to rotund sweaty man working the cash I just walked from. I just looked at her and then looked at the man and she took this as me not understanding I believe because she interrupted his conversation to which he asked what she wanted and she said ""coffee"" and pointed at me. ""Too late for coffee."" And then he started back into his conversation. I stepped back to his counter because I didn't know how to order from the Korean menu and he said to his friend in English for some reason ""one second ill deal with this.""

""No coffee, what do want?"" He asked me. ""Food."" I replied. ""I want-"" he cut me off and says something to his friend i don't understand. I speak over them. ""This is taking too fucking long."" I'm not sure why those words came but in my defense it was taking too long. 

He got loud and stood up straight, started berating me for swearing in his establishment and so I apologized, I said he was right I shouldn't have said the f word but then I laughed and reaffirmed that it was taking a long time though.

He got more mad and very loud. Nobody in the restaurant was looking at us and he threw me out... Verbally. It was quite a strange feeling and i was left feeling like it escalated pretty quickly but I swore at him in front of his friend.

"AITA for asking my ex questions about why she cheated on me?. So a bit over a week ago, I discovered my gf (now ex) had cheated on me with one of my past friends by sexting him on snapchat. I completely understand I was the asshole for how I discovered it, I went through her messages with him but I knew something was up. This was because a while before I went through her mesages, she pretended to send pictures of herself to me, however, they were not of her but were pictures she found online, plus out of the blue she wanted to upload pictures of herself in her swimsuit in a slight sexual manner onto instagram (she later revealed that these pictures were not hers when I was questioning her after I broke up with her after her sexting). She asked if she could upload them, but I told her they made me uncomfortable and she took them down. I told her she didn't have to yet she still took them down. ( I was not controlling in this situation, she told me that herself). However, a week or two later she uploaded said photos to another Instagram account I did not know about without telling me. She knew they made me uncomfortable, yet when I found about and confronted her she said she did it because she was bored. (Later, after we broke up she said it was because she wanted to fit in with other girls). After this I had enough and went through her messages and found sexts with another guy, and so I broke up with her. So in the week or two since then, I've been asking her questions about why she did it, how she felt, how she feels now, and questions similar to that. I cant entirely get over it and sometimes I repeat my questions I've asked before  without realizing. I feel as though getting to the bottom of it makes me feel better. She told me she sexted him to bring him close and then keep him at bay to fuck with his head and make him feel how she made him feel. (Before we were dating, she was in an unnoficap sexual long distance relationship with him and apparently he fucked with her head and made her feel bad, thus she felt like getting revenge. Without telling me.) Upon questioning her I have found changes in her explanations for doing it, for instance one time she said she sexted him to make him feel bad, the next time I asked she did it because she didnt want him to feel bad ""for not having a way masterbate because his girlfriend wasnt sexting him."" But the reason I posted is because she gets annoyed with me asking questions as to why she did this, and upset that I ""bring up past mistakes and hurt her"" even though it's been two weeks since we have broken up. I understand I have to move on though. I will try my hardest to do so. Please be honest.","NTA. Bruh you are completely right for asking why she did those things.

It may be that it's hard for her to admit that she was wrong, therefore it's easier to be dismissive and make you feel like you're being shitty, it's called gaslighting, do not fall for it.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna mention something which might not make sense. Firstly, the basic human right is to be valued and have things explained to you *however* this does not mean that this person will give you an explanation. This is a real harsh reality but it's true.

The fact that her reasoning changes each time just shows you how deceptive she's being.

Personally I don't see the excuse of drinking/doing drugs making you cheat, my theory is you would have had to have that feeling to do so, so the drink/drugs gave you confidence to carry it out.

You seem like a decent person and you deserve to find someone who values that, she obviously does not. It's gonna be a new year soon so fuck these people and work on your self development.

"AITA for not letting my roommates use my kitchen stuff. Hi guys. I'm feeling really conflicted about this situation. I have been living in a four bedroom apartment alone for the past five months. Each lease is individual, so I was always waiting for the landlord/management to move more people in. They didn't so this apartment has pretty much become completely mine in a sense, even though I knew if someone moved in, it wouldn't be ""mine"" anymore. 
Note: the apartment is advertised and only has ever been advertised as unfurnished by management. 
This Tuesday, three new roommate moved in. I wasn't happy, but obviously I have to live with it and I typically don't mind having roommates. The thing is, they all brought minimal kitchen supplies and have all decided that without asking if it was okay, they would use all of my stuff. Cups, plates, pans, utensils, everything. I only have three bowls, cups, plates, and each utensil. Had they asked, I would have allowed them to use everything, as long as they clean it right away because it's my stuff and I want to be able to use it when I want. 
But the thing is that they haven't asked me once and I will go to eat something and everything will be dirty in the sink. So, I packed everything up in boxes (since I'm moving in 10 days anyways) and only use it when I need it. I politely texted all three of them that they would need to get their own kitchen supplies from now on (they were going to have to when I left anyways) and that I did not appreciate them using everything without asking. They all replied that they thought everything in the kitchen was fair game (um wut... That's not how living with strangers work) and that I should just deal with it until move out and then they will get their own stuff. I am saying that that isn't fair to me. It is my stuff and they didn't ask, which is rude and not how you treat roommates you met for the first time a few days ago. I would also like to be able to eat when I want without having to clean the dishes that they used. 
I feel kind of bad for taking everything away from them and on one hand I feel like I should just deal with it for 10 days, but on the other hand, I'm annoyed that these people I have never met think they are entitled my belongings without asking. I will say I am the asshole for taking the microwave, toaster, and blender out of the kitchen, but I'm just annoyed with everything else. 
So am I the asshole?
","Not the asshole.  At first I thought you should give them the benefit of the doubt about assuming the stuff came with the place as some sort of hand-me-downs from previous tenants, but their response to you changed that and made them the assholes.

"AITA For Seeing A Movie Without My Girlfriend. I went and saw Pet Semetary with a friend tonight.

As such, I didn't mention I was going to see the movie to her as it seemed she didn't want to talk to me.

"AITA for getting mad at my GF when she rescinded her offer to buy us both a vacation?. Hey, first post here, I'll try and keep it on the shorter side.

So I'm 27M and have been with my 23yo GF for about a year and a half now. We moved in together last October with the understanding that she doesn't make enough to split the rent, but we would figure something out.

I only make $2500/mo and the rent alone is $1500/mo. I (foolishly) agreed to let her pay for the Cable and the Electric bill each month because I know she doesn't make that kind of money just yet...she works at a private kindergarten that pays some shit like $10/hr. As it turns out, our cable bill is legit under $5/mo and cable is $140/mo.

Since we've been *dating*, she's always complained/bugged me about wanting to go on vacations. I would always tell her, I can't afford that, I have to save up for the apartment. Now it's, I can't afford that I spend more than half of my monthly income on rent.

So about a week or so ago, she randomly texts me a picture of $50 flights to Fort Lauderdale and a link to a $50/night AirBnb. I text her back saying I'm sorry I wish, but I just can't afford it right now.

She goes, ""Okay, surprise, I'm going to get it for us as a special treat!""

Fast forward to tonight, we're getting dinner and drinks, and I ask her (bc I genuinely forgot) if she still owes me money that I've lent her. She goes ""yeah I still owe you $160"", so I'm like okay cool just making sure. 

THEN she goes, ""but if I'm paying you that back, I'm not paying for your vacation to Florida.""

I legitimately felt like I wanted to cry. She's my first legit girlfriend, and no one's ever been that nice to me and offer to take me on a vacation (not counting family trips when I was like 12-16).

So I said, I can't afford that because I have to pay the whole rent every month. She goes ""sucks for you guess I gotta find someone else to go with. **I** pay for the dinner bill **and** tip, and just stop talking to her.

We get home, and it's been snowing outside, my boots are wet. I walk maybe 10 feet into the apartment so I can sit and take my shoes off when she goes ""can you stop walking everywhere with your dirty shoes.""

I immediately snap back, ""Don't tell me what to do in MY house when I'm the one who pays for it.""

Needless to say, she didn't like that very much...went into the bedroom and hasn't come out since.

"AITA for being on my phone while my friend vented about her BF for the 1000th time?. Last weekend I saw my friend (we’re both 23F if it matters). She’s been in a toxic and all-consuming, on again off again relationship for 6 years. We met Friday night just the two of us, and Saturday night with two other mutual friends. 

Friday night was just the two of us. We got drinks and I listened to her talk about her relationship troubles. I do my best to give thoughtful advice but she’s been having the same problems with him for years, and it’s almost all she ever talks about. (We hardly ever talk about my problems, and when we do she dismisses my feelings pretty quickly). Regardless, i listened to her and we had a thoughtful talk that night.

Then the next night we got dinner with two other mutual friends. I was looking forward to talking with everyone, but only a few minutes after being seated she brings up her BF problems to the others. I figured since we just talked about this last night and it was the exact same story, she wasn’t really talking to me, but to the others. I already said everything I could say the other night so I just turned away and went on my phone to let her talk to them. This conversion went on for literally the entire meal, so I was a little upset, I may have sighed a little here or there. Other than that, I just left them to talk about it and stayed on my phone. 

Fast forward through this last week. She has ignored my multiple messages, asking what’s wrong, etc, until I finally got an answer out of her in which she said “I don’t think we can support each other. I don’t want to hang out, or get in to why.” 

We then proceeded to have a huge fight over phone call where she called me bitchy, questioned my life choices, saying she wouldn’t ever take my advice because “this isn’t some random tinder guy I’m fucking” (a dig at me). She claims I huffed and puffed and rolled my eyes the entire meal. I have no recollection of the eye rolling, I may have let out a sigh or two, but certainly wasn’t trying to be obvious. I felt pretty ignored, I’m surprised anyone even noticed me there.

Now she’s decided, that because of my behavior at this one dinner, we can’t be friends. Side note, she’s leaving the friendship when I’m in the middle of a lot of heavy problems of my own.

"WIBTA if I refused to pay for groceries a friend gave me that I thought was free?. Throwaway because my friend knows my real account.

I offered to store a few bags of groceries for a friend who had to move out of his house in a rush. Two weeks later my friend decided to move to another state and not take back the groceries (which is mostly dry stuff like salt, pepper, oil, flour etc nothing expensive.) A lot of the stuff is sealed and unused. While he was deciding whether to move I ran out of flour and asked if I could use his and he said yes sure.

Now he's told me that he expects me to pay for all the groceries I got from him because 'I would have bought it anyway'. I'm a little annoyed because I may not have accepted the groceries if I knew he wanted me to pay for it- he buys slightly more expensive stuff than I normally use. To be fair it isn't like he bought truffle flake salt, it's stuff like sea salt in grinders whereas I normally use the cheapest coarse salt and olive oil instead of generic vegetable oil. I just think it's really rude he never said anything about me having to pay to start with- for example, he could have told me when I wanted his flour 'oh that's fine, but would you mind paying for this and the rest of my groceries if you want to keep it?' Instead he let me go ahead and use it without saying anything.

If I were in his position and had to move, I'd probably just give away stuff for free and not demand payment- after all if I didn't give it away I'd have to toss it. On the other hand, it is true that I would have bought this stuff anyway, so I thought maybe it's fair he wants payment, especially since a lot of the groceries are sealed and new.

I appreciate our friendship more than some cheap groceries so honestly I will probably pay up anyway. I was just wondering WIBTA if I told him that I think it's unfair he wants me to pay?","NTA

"AITA for refusing to pay my housemate's share of the bills, even though she wasn't living there?. **Background:** Myself and two friends (""Fiona"" and ""Eric"") had been housesharing since our first year at university (UK) and for our final year we decided to find a new place for just the three of us. The contract was a year starting July. When it came to deciding whether pay for an all-inclusive bills package, Eric voted not to, but Fiona and I both wanted to, so we went for it. For anybody who doesn't know, all-inclusive means you pay a set price every month for bills regardless of how much you use.

\---

**The situation:** After moving in, Fiona found out she had been accepted for a very sought-after internship in her field. Accepting it would mean taking a year out of uni and finding other accommodation in a different country from mid-September to May. She accepted.

Eric and I said that she was welcome to find a different person to rent her room, though neither of us wanted to live with a stranger. She decided to leave the room empty to save the hassle; she did still use during holidays and for storage.

All was fine for the first few months of term, until Fiona got some bad news in December. It turned out that - since she was on a paid internship - she would have to pay council tax, while Eric and I were both still exempt. This totalled up to around £700, which Fiona said she couldn't afford. This is where it gets tricky. She quite firmly suggested that Eric and I should split her share of the bills. This would mean I went from paying £70 a month on bills to paying £105, same for Eric.

I told Fiona that I couldn't afford to do that, and apologised. Eric perhaps could have got together the money, but it would have meant taking a loan from his parents, which I don't blame him for not wanting to do. We both also felt that it was unfair to expect us to pay more, since the fact that Fiona was not using the heating/electric did not mean that our bills were reduced, due to the all-inclusive package, and she had never once suggested that we would need to pay her share of the bills before this. We made it clear that in a situation where the bills were organised by us, and her not using the electric/heating would have led to a reduction in costs, we absolutely would not have expected her to pay any bills.

Fiona was furious, and our friendship never recovered. We still don't speak.

Some further notes which I feel are relevant:

* Fiona and I had arranged a theatre trip, which was for March. Due to my own money issues, I asked her to cancel my ticket and refund me for the \~£200 it cost, which she did. Fiona chose not to get her ticket refunded.
* Fiona and I lived in the house for three months over the summer, while Eric did not. He still paid for his rent and bills.

**So my question is, am I the asshole for not paying Fiona's share of the bills?**

It's just weighed on my mind, as I lost a three-year friendship over it.","NTA An agreement, verbal or written is binding.

"AITA for asking for a refund for shoes I bought from my regular store but found cheaper elsewhere?. I popped out in my lunch hour to buy a new pair of shoes from an independent store I’ve been frequenting for years. My podiatrist recommended the store originally, my purchase history is in their database, and the consultants who work there really know their stuff and give great advice. I happily handed over the price on the price tag for the new design the consultant recommended.  

I then wandered over to the local shopping center, where I happened to see a sign outside a chain sports shoe store saying “50% off all Asics”. They were selling the identical shoes I’d literally just bought for over £50 off.  I asked if they had my size in stock, and they did.  

So after some hesitation, I traipsed back over to the independent store and said “I hate to do this, but...” [showed them a photo I’d taken of the price tag of the same shoes on sale a few hundred meters away].  The consultant held his hands up in the air and looked completely downcast, “oh our friends at the center are at it again”.

"AITA for wearing singleton socks?. Throw-away because a lot of people know me and my girlfriend's reddit accounts.  


I'll keep this short. I'm notoriously bad at keeping track of my socks. I often lose the mate to a pair of socks and subsequently have many singleton socks with missing mates. This doesn't bother me at all, but I live with my girlfriend and we divide up the chores so that she does the laundry much more often than I do (I do other chores). Anyway, we have a shared drawer for socks and essentially share all the (clean!) socks that we have. The socks with missing mates drive her absolutely crazy and to try and fix the problem, she has started stuffing the singleton socks into a box so that the complete, non-missing pairs can live in the main drawer, and so that she can try to track down the missing mates and create a matching pair.

>no wonder you got to [my uni] so slow to catch on (for added context, with my grades I could have gone to any uni in the country. I chose mine)

Anyway, the convo continued with him calling the bar at my uni shit (🤷‍♂️) and eventually getting to *'our bar is better because I saw someone who graduated years ago there'* and *""Your lonely ass wouldn't understand""*.

Now this did offend me because honestly since we went our separate ways he has no fuckin clue what I've been up to, and even at school I was one of the most socially active people in our grade. It'd be like me making a hiroshima joke to him; it's just wrong to begin with, plus he's not even Japanese so it doesn't even make any sense. I said to him 

>HAHA don't even at me about being lonely, you have no idea what I do

to which he came back with

>What sucking guys off

>you a gay stripper or someshit now

At this point I kind of went off. To fully understand why, you have to know that he's been doing this for months. In person and online, in DMs and group chats. If anyone brings up the topic of sexuality or relationships, I have to stop contributing immediately or it'll end up being about that. Even in completely and entirely unrelated conversations such as above, he still brings it up as a 'roast'. I've made it clear multiple times that it's not ok, and he keeps going.

I feel like he's defining my entire self by my sexuality, as if there's nothing else to my character. That's just one part of the problem though.

He's said now that he'll stop (sure, whatever) but he keeps calling what he's doing a 'joke' (""I'll stop making the joke"", ""dude it's just a joke"") and he keeps telling me to chill and that it's not a big deal and I'm overreacting, which makes me think he still doesn't realise what he's done wrong and how big of a deal this is to me. That's the bigger issue imo. I don't care that he's going to stop, or that he's apologised (he actually hasn't). I'm pissed that he thinks he's done nothing wrong and that this is no big deal.

Am I overreacting? AITA?","NTA, he sounds like an immature asshole

"AITA for not inviting a few very old friends, that I haven’t spoken to in years, to my wedding?. A little context. When I was a kid, I was into recreational drug use and “raving.” As is with massive amounts of drug usage, comes a tendency to make friends with likeminded individuals. Additionally, drugs have a tendency of bonding people together in a way that’s really kind of indescribable. Sometimes the relationships are surface level and superficial, but sometimes they run deep and last a really long time. 

So this was over a decade ago. The real friendships I made during that time in my life lasted for years, but eventually faded out and turned in FB Status updates only. I went on with my life and took a new path. Some of those friends did too. We all stopped partying and just kind of grew up, but we all took different paths and only some of us remained close. 

By the time I met my now husband, got engaged, and shortly after married, I hadn’t spoken to any of those friends in years. I occasionally reached out on fb, or by text, but once the invitations for child’s bday parties or get togethers stopped I kind of just assumed we had all moved on. 

Coincidentally I did not invite any of them to my wedding. I had considered it, but I was under a lot of pressure from my family who was paying for it all. I really only had 2 of my close friends there, who were both in the wedding, and the rest were only specific family members and friends of my mom (who paid for everything so I could t really complain). My mother. She’s fun. She would SAY I could invite anyone, but then guilt trip me about cost and decide that it wasn’t possible after all. I didn’t fight it much because again, I thought all my old friends had moved on anyways and wouldn’t be interested. 

Today I randomly messaged one of these friends, thinking I was offering some helpful advice, thinking nothing of anything. It turned into a full blown attack and her being very upset that she wasn’t invited to my wedding. She went on to say how she wasn’t the only one who was hurt, that I had hurt a lot of people and they were all disappointed that I had not considered them. 

I tried to explain my position with the pressure from my parents. I felt bad. But in all honesty I hadn’t heard from any of them either and truly didn’t think anything of it. If I had known that I was hurting anyone I would have tried to do things differently, but I truly didn’t think any of them cared. 

Was I in the wrong?","NTA - When you grow up, and leave your drug using teenaged brained at any age friends behind, its common not to invite them to your wedding.

If they were actual friends, you would still hangout without the drugs and raves. They are not actual friends. FB friends are not actual friends.

"AITA for telling my Jewish coworker it's uncool to refer to people's ethnicity/race as ""purebred""?. Every year at the office we pick out a day to decorate the Christmas tree. To my knowledge, there has been and upspoken tradition for my Jewish coworker to be the one that puts the star on the Xmas tree, She says this is because she is the only Jewish person at the office(this a few years ago, but we have plenty of Jewish people).

This year we get an email about when the tree decoration will happen by my Jewish coworker. She explains how there will be drinks and snacks, ect. then ends the emails with this: *""PS - The tradition still stands that only first born purebred Jewish females in the office may put the star on the top of the tree.""*

I instantly find this pretty offensive that she is using the word purebred when it comes to religion and using that as an excuse to be the one to places the star on the tree each year. I followed by messaging her about how uncomfortable her email is, she responded by saying that no one else found it offensive and it was mainly a joke to another coworker who happened to be half-Jewish. (this made me even more uncomfortable.) She also ends up using her grandparents being in the holocaust as an excuse for this, it starts getting too awkward at this point and I ended the conversation with ""it just made me uncomfortable but I guess it's just me.""

What do you guys think about this whole situation, should I let it go or report it to our HR? (our HR is an online service, btw)

**UPDATE:** I decided to wait until today's tree party and see if any other comments get made. I also spoke to the other girl (she hasn't been in the office since today) She read the email and said that it was super inappropriate and felt like she was being called Mudblood like in harry potter.

"AITA for not immediately offering help. My(29F) boyfriend (34M) called me and told me his battery died on his car and would need a jump.

"AITA for leaving home and cutting contact with my entire maternal family?. Aight. Let's keep this as brief as we can- bullet point form, quite the saga. Will explain if asked.

• 2016, I'm 15. I meet a boy (Ken) and we get together over text. Our humour is very vulgar. Mom has a history of snatching my phone to search it. She does so, finds these jokes. I'm forbidden from ever speaking to him again.
• I do anyway, as she won't even listen to compromise. I'm kicked out of home, Feb 2017-Aug 2017. Ken and I broke up Jun/July 2017.
• I start sixth form, get a new boyfriend. Ken and I reconnect, we're still in love. His relationship is open. I leave my BF Feb 2018. Ken and I start sleeping together.
• Mom starts snatching my phone again, finds out Ken and I are still talking. Hits the roof. Phone is locked into a glorified clock. Dad, who I dont live with and with whom I am the only one of my family who speaks to him, gets me a new secret phone to contact him and Ken on.
• I leave my second phone at home by accident one day and mom 'just so happens' to find it in a bag. Turns my room upside down and steals a cheque for £1300 I forgot to cash from inheritance. On the phone is every detail of Ken and I's relationship (we got together again March 2018).
• Mom forces me to get an STD test and contraceptive implant even though I wanted the pill. 24/7 tracker put on my phone so I can't meet up with anyone without mom's knowing, not that she ever let me. Sister and mom's partner's family cease contact with me pretty much entirely despite me still living with my mom and sister (my stepmom & her kids lived separate anyway). I'm accused of acting like nothings wrong when I try to be friendly. Mom + and aunt suggest I have had a miscarriage because of Ken even though I told them we were safe, and suggest Ken has done awful things to me that he never did. They call me names I hesitate to write
• I had been disallowed from talking to my dad entirely. This is lifted only so I can call him
• Family starts leaving for trips etc without even telling me they're going. I am separated even from mealtimes and live on pasta for a week while everyone else has family meals and I eat later
• I call my dad Aug 2018 and attempt to leave home, leaving my mom a letter admitting my faults + asking her not to come after me. She and partner try to physically force me into the car home anyway after finding I've left, my sister told them after she saw me go. Dad comes in the nick of time
• Mom sends me a huge email in response saying I left purely to spite her and she isnt in the wrong whatsoever. We trade emails to check up every now and again but she grows increasingly guilt-trippy. I've spoken to no-one but her in months
• I tell her I've gotten into university and am met with a 500-word essay on why I'm a bitch and why I must hate her for not having more constant contact. Wished her a happy birthday recently but not Mother's Day- will explain this if asked, wont fit

"AITA for not wanting my nephew around?. I am on a weekend trip with my wife, my two sons aged 2.5 years and 8 months. They are great kids and I think as a result of my wife and I working super hard on routine/schedule/discipline etc. We are a solid team and just getting by every day with our own unit is tiresome and challengung but rewarding because I love these little fuckers like nothing else in the world.

My wife brought along her sister's 2.5 year old son this week because his mother is 8 months pregnant and she felt bad leaving him cooped up in the house since she is too fat/lazy/pregnant (her own words) to do anything with him. Not sure why she couldnt come along on the trip (at my mother in laws beach house) but I digress. Now this kid is the spawn of a loser father who is 47 years old, already abandoned 3 kids from previous women and has been in and out of lock up his whole life. They actually met in prison.  He is excommunicated from the family due to a number of reasons so my SIL basically functioned as a single parent if not worse because the guy is a drug addict and refuses to work.

Now, for some reason, she decided to plant more of her fertilized eggs by this fucko (against his wishes) and she has twins coming. He has disappeared for the last 2 weeks (hopefully for good).  So again, this kid has been around more and more and he is a total pain in the ass.

He doesn't  talk since all his parents do is place in front of a TV. He bites and hits my sons. He can only eat mushed up food since all they feed him is pouches of baby food and he stays up til 10pm and wakes up at 9am which is the opposite of the entire houses schedule.

No one is enjoying this weekend but I can sense I am going to have this kid around more often. Don't get me wrong I love kids but it's a nightmare to take care of him and every time he is around my son it takes a few days to rid him of the bad habits he learns (biting/hiting/pushing).

Am i the asshole if I tell my wife I don't want her nephew around ? For like sleep overs and weekends away?


Update:

My nephew has been enrolled in an IEP and is doing much better. His behavior is so much improved since being enrolled in day care too. I think the structure is huge.

"AITA For wanting to have CAS involved in my sister's life and have my nephew taken away?. So I live in Alberta, CA and my sister lives in Ontario, Ca.

&#x200B;

I've caught wind of multiple situations from my mother of abusive behavior from my sister towards her son. To start things off my nephew is 3 years old turning 4 in January. She got into a new relationship about a year ago and since then has been spiraling into some self destructive tendencies.  Her boyfriend regularly verbally abuses him and mistreats him while she's away.  She's completely aware of his actions though.

&#x200B;

During the summer months B (boyfriend) would take him and put him on top of his truck hood while he had shorts on so his legs would burn if ever he was acting up. They (sister and B) would force him into a corner and keep him there while they have friends over and are drinking/smoking. They regularly have avoided taking him to the doctors office. As far as I'm aware they're keeping a lot of stuff to do with my nephew off the books, illnesses, shots, anything that might involve them spending money on him if they don't have to. This child is essentially a pet that they'd rather not take care of if they don't have to..

There's a lot more stuff that can be brought up here but I feel stuck being across the country and already having so little involvement in my nephews life. I'm scared for his safety but there's a part of me that looks at it as family and this can tear apart my nephews life. I can't have him brought out here. My mother is handicapped and can't care for a young child. Beyond that we have no family support.

"AITA for being aloof to my roommate?. January I let a room to an acquaintance with a year lease. Before they signed, we had a convo about how I am a private person and I will not tolerate anyone going into my bedroom for any reason. They said they understood, lease was signed, they move in.

Almost immediately I suspect that this person is a functioning alcoholic. Every day they drink as soon as they are home from work and don’t stop until they go to sleep. The roommate is forgetful about things. We work for the same company and daily I have to tell them I don’t talk shop at home. They continually feed my cats even after many reminders to not feed them. They started watching me while I am working out or doing art in the hobby room. I keep that door open so my dog won’t get upset when she can’t go in and out of a room (training is ongoing). After a few drinks, roommate would stand in the door way and watch me, even after I remind them about my need for privacy. They would apologize and leave but a few days later they would do it again. Rinse. Repeat. Now I keep the door shut.

Four months into the lease I woke up at 2am and saw roommate standing in my bedroom. It kind of freaked me out so I sat up and immediately they said “Oh, shit. Sorry.” and then ran out of my bedroom, slammed my door shut, and then ran into their bedroom. I sleep nude. They next day I confronted roommate about last night and they don’t remember the incident. After some back and forth about that and the other things they are doing, I jokingly said that they must be a sleepwalker if they can’t remember all of these things they are doing. They stated that they sleepwalked a few times in their 20s about 20 years ago. I shared a room with a sibling, who is a sleepwalker, for 15 years and they were never that “aware” when they had an episode, but I’m not an expert. I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt but I suspect the drinking is the real culprit, since they didn’t mention sleep walking until after I brought it up. I told them the next time I see them in my bedroom at night, it will be their last night in my house. I don’t care if you’re sleepwalking, it’s your responsibility mitigate that issue. 

I put a lock on my bedroom door and since then, I have stopped interacting with them other than basic responses. I don’t ignore them, I just gray rock them. This is my plan until they leave in 2 months. I am just trying to get through this tenancy with my mental health intact. I now have trouble sleeping. They continue to do other creepy things, like following me into a room and block my way out to force me to converse with them. Comment on my appearance in ways I am not comfortable with, even when I tell them not to. I am tired of having to correct them because they can’t remember shit. Others have said that I should just hash it out with them instead of being so cold and roommate can’t help that they are a sleepwalker.

So, AITA for being aloof to my roommate?","NTA, this guy is most likely a creep or at best suffers from blackouts, very common in alcoholics. I've experienced a few and if this is the case at least I can say from experience that he will literally not remember anything, not like a fuzzy haze- I mean completely gone from existence. Thats probably not too reassuring tho. 

Anyway this guy is extremely toxic to be around due to the unpredictability of his actions and his creepy tendency. If it were me I'd kick him out of my house, go to the police and tell them this, they'll give you legal advice and probably supervise while he comes to get his stuff.

"AITA for revealing personal stuff about my friend to this new guys she was seeing?. This girl \[22 F\] and I \[21 F\] met when we were 10, stayed friends through high school. Really close for the first 5+ years. She was shy but became more and more secretive with time. Her mom died when she was 12 and it definitely played a role in later events.

At 16 she starts dating this boy who was friends with me & suddenly shuts me out. Never shares anything, lies when I casually ask. She later dumps the guy for no apparent reason, starts an equivocal friendship with a guy from our school. He’s in love with her. When asked, she says she doesn’t like him and would never get with him. Few months later the guy texts me on Facebook, says he’s desperate bc she ghosted him, asks me for help. Proceeds to tell me about how they’ve been having an intense romantic relationship and but she’s manipulative, psychologically abusive, cheating. Everything I hear is consistent with what her ex (who was my friend) had told me about her. 

If I try to confront her discreetly, she either denies or falls silent. She's also clearly spiraling into depression. It’s not only me she’s not talking to, her family is worried & try to get her to a professional but she just won’t go & pretend she's perfectly fine.

We’re both 18 at this point & I’ve had more friends come up to me & talk about how badly she acted towards them. Some of them are people she’d told me she had no interest in, but I find out from them they had actually dated. At this point I’m just disillusioned: I've tried everything (discreetly, never pushed her) and she still lies & keeps me away. I give up as I'm starting to feel hurt.

Last year she started another ambiguous friendship-relationship with a friend of my partner’s.

My partner begged me to talk this guy, because otherwise he would’ve gotten hurt for sure. I figured it was important for him to know what kind of danger he was in; so I told him how she’d acted before with guys who had identical stories to his. I finally suggested to him not to shut her out completely, because she didn’t deserve that, but to just keep their relationship on a friendship level, as I knew she never acted badly with friends, only boyfriends. 

Not only did he ignore my suggestion, but he got into that toxic relationship with her and got fucked up enough that during a fight he told her what I had said to him. She recently confronted me about it and told me she now feels like she can’t trust me anymore, feels betrayed and disappointed and doesn’t want to see me anymore.

Now. I did technically disclosed personal details about my friend behind her back, I did “betray her trust”(assuming she had any in me, since all the information I had came from other people), but I did it to help someone I though didn’t deserve that treatment and I only stated things she had done factually, expressing no further judgement.

A little backstory:
Boyfriend just had a “midlife crisis” and bought a sweet car just for fun. This sets our budget back a lot.  Keep in mind I’ve had to ask for rides home before and sometimes he gets me, sometimes because he decides to not be able to skip one night of the bar trivia I need to find someone else for a ride if I can’t drive (medical issues.) I work a weird afternoon/night shift (3pm-9 or 11pm) He works a funny morning shit (6am-3:30pm). He scheduled car maintenance on his prized possession for tomorrow. Which would be no big deal but he would have to wait for a car and he had to go to work. He wanted to drop it off the night before which would be fine. I suggested dropping a key at the place and then going home and I could meet him after work so he could drop off the car and I’d drive home. He was upset that wasn’t good enough. He then made a big deal about how he could just walk to my place of employment and take my car home. To then grab his other car. Except I needed my car at work because it’s part of my job. So he threw a fit there too. I still don’t know why he couldn’t wait until I was done with work to leave his baby at the dealership.  

Anyway, he got lucky. I was able to go into work late, meet him at 3:45, and then he took me to work because I was getting out early and no longer needed my car. 

Fast forward to on the way home. He tells me he threw out a bunch of stuff that wasn’t needed from the fridge.  That seems fine right? Except, I purposely had three pieces of a specialty pizza from two days ago, and today’s leftovers from lunch with friends. Both things I was still going to eat and paid for. (The paid for is important because there was another pizza that I ordered special when he wasn’t home that he picked the ingredients off of and at all of) I come home, find what’s left of the other specialty pizza, AND A WHOLE BURRITO FROM TODAY gone.

Erica and I have tried to be understanding, but we've been irritated because Liz has been assimilating Jared into our lives by bringing him everywhere we go and engaging in excessive PDA. We told her that we won't hold it against her, but can't support the relationship due to the age gap. Anyway, Liz mentioned the idea of Jared coming to the fest with us several times. We've both told her no, as we thought it was gonna be just the 3 of us and we didn't wanna change that. Liz started trying to list reasons he should come: that he could buy alcohol in-festival, and that he could ""protect"" us. She also tried to say that it wasn't fair that I got to bring my boyfriend last year, but she can't bring Jared. I think the situations are completely different since I wasn't dating him last year, he's Erica's cousin + our friends, andd our parents wanted him to go. Liz told us she understood where we were coming from and we thought the matter was done with.

Apparently not. Liz texted us today asking if Jared can come to the festival with us, and that he bought a 10 person tent for the 4 of us and sent a photo of them putting together the tent. We didn't respond for awhile and she started calling us and texting us separately. Erica and I are trying to figure out what to do in this situation. At this point Liz isn't even giving us a choice. We feel like Liz is disregarding our feelings on the matter, and also being a bit of a hypocrite since she was the one so insistent on it being the three of us. It's not even that we dislike Jared, we just think we'll have a better time without him there. When they're together, they're all over each other and it irritates me and Erica.  Is it really that hard for Liz to go a weekend without Jared? We just want a carefree weekend with our gal pals and bringing Jared would change the entire dynamic.

Am I being unreasonable here? I mean, maybe we're making a big deal out of nothing. But it really irritates me that Liz won't take no for an answer and keeps pressuring us to agree.",NTA. Although if I were you I’d be an asshole and insist on him not coming even though he bought a tent. I’m sure part of the reason for the photograph would be to make you feel bad.

"AITA for moving and renting out our house and not consulting my brother in law?. Technically are WE the Assholes?

So my husband’s Grandma died and left him some money. Not that much but enough for us to put with our savings and buy a second property as an investment. We’ve just had an offer accepted. 

We plan to move into the new place which has a workshop attached for my husband, Jeff, to work on his motorbikes and rent out our existing place, which is bigger and likely to make more $ in rent.

He told his family and his brother is pissed! 

His brother, who we’ll call Brad, is about 10 years older and used to part-own our existing house. 

See, when Jeff was 15 he came to live with Brad for family reasons. Jeff, Brad and their Mum bought our existing house for Jeff and Brad to live in, but Brad moved away after about 4 years and has been traveling and working abroad since. 

I met Jeff just after Brad moved away and then moved in with him after a couple of years with Brad’s blessing. We started covering the mortgage ourselves and after we got engaged agreed to buy the house off of Brad and Mother-in-Law, seen as we wanted to get on the property ladder, already lived there, and Brad had no interest in moving back in. 

This didn’t happen for a couple of years, not for lack of us pushing. Brad is a hoarder (he’d admit this) and doesn’t like to get rid of anything.

During this time we were stuck in limbo, unable to move house or buy the existing one, all the while contributing to a mortgage which was only one third Jeff’s. 

We finally completed last year and are no longer financially tied to him. It still took him another 6 months to sort out the room full of stuff he had left with us, which is now in our attic.

So, back to present day and our situation has changed. We’re starting a family, and need somewhere with better vehicle access and a workshop for Jeff. It makes more financial and practical sense to move and rent the existing place, rather than buy somewhere else to rent out. We’d always wanted to do this at some point, but now we have the inheritance it’s possible now. 

We haven’t heard from Brad in ages as he’s away travelling, and hasn’t often replied to Jeff’s messages. Jeff can’t remember the last time they managed to speak on the phone. 

When we had the offer accepted Jeff text his family. Brad came back saying he would have liked to have been told we wouldn’t be living in [existing house], because he has an emotional attachment to the place and wouldn’t have sold it to us if he knew we wouldn’t be living there.

We thought he would have been happy for us. He’d never suggested buying Jeff out, or moving back, or any alternative to us buying it. We’d have owned it 3 years ago if it were up to us. If he’d seriously not wanted to sell it, we’d probably have bought somewhere else three years ago. 

We really get on with Brad, but I think he has some deep seated issues that Jeff owes him for letting him come and live with him. He’s told me that he’s sick of the special treatment Jeff gets off their Mum. 

I feel like he thinks we have to ask his permission to move? Are we the assholes for deciding to move and rent the place out? Are we assholes for not consulting him?

TLDR Bought house off brother-in-law. Moving out and renting it out after a year. B-I-L pissed he wasn’t consulted. AITA?","No. Brad is a hoarder, and can't let go of anything- including the old house. The best you can do now is to tell him that you are sorry you couldn't reach him for his feedback.

"AITA for really just not wanting to be near my cousin. So, bit of a background, I am a first generation college graduate from a very poor VERY white trash family, I was forced to handle most of the college stuff myself, even going so far as having to physically force my parents to file income tax so I could get loans and aid. I got nowhere near enough and had to take out private loans and pay out of pocket as well.

My cousin on my mother's side got a hell of a lot luckier, he's older than me and his parents both had decent jobs (my mother is lazy as fuck and refuses to work, always has). He got a good tech certification for free, thanks to his mom and step-dad, he has enough to own a home. And randomly decided to be a trucker.

When he decided this, his personality changed, he went from an intelligent guy who was in on latest tech trends, to an ignorant redneck who ""rolls coal"" has no teeth, and believes climate/vaccine deniers ""have a point"". Basically he became everything I just can't stand being around.  To top this he CONSTANTLY complains about his new job, he hates it, they never let HIM pick where he wants to drive!  It just annoys me because I will likely never even leave my state again because of financial issues and to me he comes off as a spoiled brat (fun fact, he is one).

Through all of this my family pulls that bullshit ""oh but he's FAAAAMILLLLLYYYY"" card any time I refuse to be around him.  Don't get me wrong, I don't HATE him by any means, I'm just sick of being around him because I'm expected to hold my tongue and let him speech his bullshit.

"AITA For being upset for getting snapped at when I'm asked to do my sisters wedding invitations when I'm not feeling well. So a little backstory: I have lupus and I'm 32 years old. I live with my dad because I'm to ill to work. Most days are a struggle for me. Which my family doesnt seem to understand, they think I will just get better even though I've suffered for 10 year and have only gotten worse.


Well my sister lives out of state with her future husband. And they just visited for a week and one of the things that they were suppose to get completed while they were here was finishing up the invites. Getting the stamps on the RSVP return envelopes and then stamps on the envelopes and send them out. 

Right after they left, which was about 20 minutes ago, my dad tells me I need to go get the stamps and get all this done. Normally I could push though my normal sickness to do such a small task. But the last few days I've been really bad, I've been extremely dizzy, to the point of not being able to walk more the going to my bed to the bathroom and back. I'm extremely nauseous and have a headache that just wont go away. Now my dad knew/knows I feel this horrible. But in his mind he thinks I'm sick like this because I'm spending to much time in bed. No I'm sick like this because I pushed my body past its limits trying to spend as much time with my sister as possible. And as usual when I push myself I end up even sicker. 

So now he is mad because I said I didnt feel comfortable driving to get the stamps. But if he or my other sister who lives here also would pick them up (after they get off work) I'd gladly place the stamps on the envelopes but I shouldn't be driving. And when he got mad at me I snapped and lost my cool because this isnt the first time someone in my family has tried to guilt me for basically being sick. I'm so frustrated. But now I feel like ta because my dad pays for everything for me. Admittedly i dont ask for much. My biggest expenses are my 2 dogs (1 I had before I got sick and the other technically wasnt mine but sister didnt take the responsibility to care for him and we bonded and have been inseparable ever since).","NTA.

My parents regularly have my twins nephews over for the weekend, 3 and 1 years old. And because they're so young it can sometimes be a two person job.

"WIBTA if I leave my house?. For a bit of a background, I lived a comfortable life as a child until high school, when my parents got a divorce. It was a really bad divorce and because my mother had been a stay-at-home mom all her life, she lost almost everything. As such, us three (including my older sister) had to make ends meet to make sure we would survive. 

We were lucky enough to be left with our house, a car, and a small monthly fee given by a close relative, so we didn't struggle as much, but it was always a bit complicated until both my sister and I started to work. I am now 33 years old and still living with both as it's the only way we can all afford the fact that my mother cannot get a job, specially now that she's 65. Me and my sister contribute equally to the household and we obviously give an extra for my mother's daily life, every month. As you might imagine, although we do not hold any grudges because of our living situation, it's been tough for my previous partners as I was never able to leave my house to live with someone else (I would always feel guilty doing so and would have to pay for basically two houses). 

Recently, our close relative stopped giving us that monthly fee (which we can only be extremely grateful for all those years!) so in order to maintain our normal lives, me and my sister will have to give a bit more to the household every month. I cannot complain about my lifestyle, I am that kind of person that doesn't need much and will spend very little every month. Nevertheless, I never knew what it was to earn my own money and spent it however I would feel like, and it seems like it's just getting worse. 

For you to have an ideia, I was giving around 30% of my monthly income to my family and will now start giving around 60%. I've been thinking a lot about this and I think it would be cheaper for me to actually rent my own place and start my life. But what about the rest? I know I would still need to give money at least for my mother to live a normal daily life, but that's some math that I will need to do on my own... 

So, I don't know, WIBTA if I leave my house and start my own life?","NTA, op I don't really understand why you would need to spend 60% of your income? You said your sisters works too?

So the basic demographics on our relationship was we met on tinder, talked for a few months, met up and stated officially dating a month after that, it was mostly good, great chemistry but we only lasted about 6 months total and she broke up with me via text🤷‍♂️ 

I have come to terms with us being done(nothing last forever and all things happen as they are supposed to😇) but I had a really strange event that gave me some closure but opened up more questions. 

I ended up connecting with a good friend of my ex gf, and through me and my ex’s friend talking, it came to light that most of what my ex had told me about herself were fictions, like her mother being sick(she told me breast cancer, turns out mother is not sick) or that she didn’t have a car(she did).  

So this all made me...super curious, if she made up all of her past and present, what about what she said about how she felt about me? I wanted to see the depth of her lies, I guess that fact that someone I loved  seemed to create all these fictions, was my relationship with her one of her fictions too?

"AITA for blowing up on my parents after they wouldn’t allow me to go to senior year homecoming. Some context: (throwaway I don’t want this getting back to me)

This girl I work with had asked me to help her study for her math exams coming up, she goes to the local community college and I’m a senior in highschool. It was logs and natural logs, and I was the only person she knew other than the professor who could help (I’m in AP Calc and obviously the prof can’t help at night). I accepted and she said the exam was tomorrow, and if I could come over tonight. I said yes, but lied to my parents saying i was at work because I knew they would say no to me going to a girls house so late, and I couldn’t say no to her as she’d helped me in the past. I know, I shouldn’t have done that.

Anyway they obviously found out and I got the explosion of them thinking we were fucking and how horrible it was (Christian foreign family). I didn’t fight back, as I knew I massively fucked up. I just accepted, and went to bed. Next day I worked again for the whole day and homecoming was at night. I’m a senior, so this years hoco actually matters in a sense. At 6pm as I was about to start ironing, my parents come in saying they’re not letting me go. I just simply said I get your mad and I know i need to accept a punishment but this is a little absurd (I didn’t yell or anything which was surprising, as this was pretty crushing for me). They declined, and also took away my phone, which didn’t allow me to let the group I was going with and my date know I wasn’t going to attend.

So, I ended up winning three awards and hoco king but couldn’t accept as it got handed to someone else. I kept my cool until I told my mom I felt kind of bad for ghosting my date and friends like that, which resulted in her yelling that I hadn’t learned my lesson and that what I did was horrible and I’m lucky they don’t get my fired from my job for something that bad. This went on for a little while (foreign family, foreign mom), until I finally blew up, screaming that what they had done is fucking ludicrous, and I would have gladly accepted any other punishment than losing a once in a lifetime moment like the hs superlatives. I cussed a lot more than I have in a sentence than I think I used other words. 

I feel super mixed. I ghosted so many people who were counting on me going with them, my date included, causing her to cry as she thought I ditched her and then to wait an extra hour, and I had won awards and was being held back from accepting. I also convinced a bunch of kids who don’t usually attend anything like that to go so we could all be there together in our senior class.

Today, I picked up my mom from school and we got home around 430. On the way we we're talking about my wisdom teeth, and she immediately went to ""just have someone cut them out."" I hate this idea or the idea of just cutting stuff out of me unless absolutely necessary. So I told her no the first time.

Then I told her about one part of my gums that has been bothering me. She offered some home remedies which I was jokingly like ""ew that stuffs gross blah blah."" In the end I said I'd do one of her home remedies bc she's pretty good at the stuff. I told her no twice.

ssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

My dad really enjoys sitting down, saying grace, and eating dinner as a family and I know it means a lot to him. I personally enjoy everyone eating together as well.

When we got home, I took a short nap before dinner. I woke up to her calling me. My dad hadn't come home from work so I figured he was really close. So they all start getting their plates, and I ask where dad was. They said he was about 10-15 minutes away. So we're going to go ahead and eat. Why? Can't you just wait 10-15 minutes to eat?

Listen, my grandpa has diabetes so I get it if he wants to go ahead and eat, I don't mind that. But no one else in the house does, you can wait 15 minutes guys, we've already waited an hour and a half for him to call, can you not wait a fraction of that time more. My Mom's excuse is ""well, I'm hungry."" Me too, but it means more that we sit down as a family and eat.
 
What really grinds my gears is that they wait for my dad to call and say he's 10-15 minutes away, and immediately start eating. This means that my dad walks in, we've already said grace, and eaten most of our food. This leaves him to eat his food alone while everyone goes and does their own thing. 

So I'd had enough of it and my mom kept telling me to get a plate and come and eat. After three or four times, I was sitting at the table with them and my glass of water (minus my dad of course) and I gave her a very stern ""no."" I didn't yell, I didn't hear my teeth, just ""no."" I told her no the third time.

Now my mom won't talk to me. I feel good because I stood up for something I really believe in. I feel bad because I hurt my mom. I don't know if this was worth the fight. It's a hill I'm willing to die on, but is it worth upsetting the peace? I don't know. 

Am I the asshole?

"AITA for not apologizing to my stepmom for something I did unconsciously?. About 2 weeks ago during dinner, I got into a pretty heated argument with my dad and stepmom about something I will spare tou the details of. I had never really had big fights with my dad before and needless to say, he seemed pretty off-guard seeing how fierce I reacted to their statements and arguments. 

The argument revolved around a few rules in the house here, some of which I don't really agree with. Up untill that point I had always just lived with them, considering this is not my house and they pay the bills. However, at that point something snapped in me and I let most of it out.

The entire fight I felt like my dad and stepmom teamed up on me, and I told them I'd rather live on my own in my moms house for two weeks (she was on vacation at that point) then to reside at my dads house that week, getting constant complaints on my behaviour by the both of them for the rest of the week.

This led to a weird exchange of words, which I will summarize below:
Me: 'I'd rather go to my moms house this week then be here and get run over by you two.'

Stepmom: 'You would be a pathetic coward for doing that.'

Me: 'Well that was somewhat uncalled for and I can't imagine you would've meant that in any nice way or whatsoever.'

S: 'Yeah you're right about that, because you're not the person I would want to be acting nice towards.'

Me (having it up to here at this point): 'Okay I'm going to finish my food right now and then I'll pack some of my clothes and head right back tot moms housefor the week, because I'm done woth this.'

When I talked about it a few days ago with my dad, he admitted my stepmom was in the wrong for saying those things, and told me it was uncalled for what she did. To this day, my stepmom hasn't apologized to me.

Fast forward to tonight, exactly two weeks from this whole situation at the dinner table. I told two of my sisters (both moved out) about this entire situation tonight, and they understood why I did what I did and said what I said. They also told me that a possible explanation for my stepmom and I not getting along well, is because for the first year of us knowing her, I ignored her.

I do not recall doing that at all, but considering I was about four years old at the time and my parents had divorced a year prior to that, I can see why I might've done that. Four year old me probably thought: 'who is this random woman and why is she telling me what I can and can't do?'.

In my opinion it is childish of her not to apologize to me for calling me out and telling me she wouldn't want to be nice to me. I feel like I shouldn't have to apologize for something I did unconsciously when I was four years old. If my stepmom still holds grudges against me for doing this, she could have just told me what the issue was and we could've worked that out. However, now she decides it would be good to totally backlash at me and call me out.

"AITA for randomizing a coworker's pronouns when they wouldn't give them?. Where I (26f) am working for the summer they want us to be very inclusive as we'll be working with teenagers who aren't all straight and identifying as the gender they were born. So one of the first things they had us do was introduce ourselves by name and what pronouns we use and prefer.

 Pretty much all of us went with the standard ones (one they/them), except for one we'll call Lee.
Lee refused to give pronouns, and when pressed made this snotty face and said ""It should be obvious."" Lee has long hair braided back, wears lip gloss, has painted nails, and wears tank tops that are tight enough to show off a generous bust.

Because Lee wouldn't give pronouns I started using they/them and so did a few other coworkers. After a day or so Lee got mad and snapped at me that they're 'not an 'it'' and not to use those pronouns.
I asked what ones to use, and Lee repeated the 'it should be obvious' remark.

I'm now on day four of referring to Lee as he/him, and Lee's seething. Lee called me an asshole today after I used 'his' in front of our biggest boss who is now using it as well.
 My brother says I'm being a complete asshole about it, as does my mom, but my girlfriend thinks it's very fitting 'if a little petty'.

 So Reddit, AITA for deliberately going with other pronouns when I can assume just what Lee wants to be called based on the 'it should be obvious' remark, or is it fine because Lee won't follow the whole 'tell us what you want to be called' rule?

Edit: Lee is my coworker, my age, not one of the teenagers.

Edit 2: The reason this has gone on for four days (since I saw someone mention it) is that Lee hasn't told me not to use he/him yet, and just glowers at me for it. If Lee said stop, I would, and I'd switch to something else.
Also I'm a girl, using she/her. Not a guy, if that changes anything.",NTA. What the fuck else are you supposed to call them? They need to just be forthcoming with it. You can’t assume accurately 100% of the time based on appearance.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for setting boundaries with my soon-to-be-divorced best friend?. Hey!
So, my best friend (f31) got married a couple of years ago, for 18months my partner and I shared the house with her and her husband.
In July they give us 2 weeks notice to free the house and find a new accommodation as “we should be living as a married couple, not with friends”.
Fair enough we packed and moved out.
Flash forward to the end of October, he wants out of the marriage, mess can’t be fixed and my friend just started looking for a new place for me, her and my partner (sayin she’d be happier if I found the way to get rid of him and move just with her).
Now she also has cats, and I’m severely allergic.
So, I told her she can stay at my place as long as she needs to get back on her feet, but no cats and definitely she can’t force me to move and I have no intention to.

"AITA for supposedly ""stealing"" my best friend's matric dance (prom) date from him?. So i (M19) had liked this particular girl  (F17) for a while, and since her parents were REALLY strict, i had to take whatever opportunites i could get to see her. So i decided that i would ask her out to my prom, and i would make it as dramatic as possible with a bouquet of flowers, a ukulele, and a haiku i wrote. I was planning on walking to her school and asking her, and i was expecting for her to say yes, as she's not as close to many other boys as what she is with me. Obviously, i told my close friends what my plans were a couple days beforehand, and so everyone knew what i was planning to do. So the day comes on which i plan to ask her, but then my one close friend (M18) takes me aside and tells me this, ""I know what you're planning on doing today man, but i already asked her last week and she said yes. I'm sorry."" 
This got me quite upset as he said nothing about asking her until the day came and i felt betrayed. His excuse was that he thought i was gonna ask another girl, but i don't believe that he could've not known about my plans, since i was talking about it for like a week. I also expected him to know that i had liked this girl, but apparently he knew none of it.
So in my mind i had 2 options; just leave the whole thing and find some other girl to ask, or go through with the original plans, even though knowing she'd say no, but still do it cause i liked her and i wanted to see her reaction.
I decided to go through with the plans, as i wanted to see her anyway and i knew that she'd love the things i had planned. So i get to the school and do everything, she hugs and thanks me several times, she obviously said no as she already yes to my friend, but then she invites me to her prom at her school, and obviously i said yes. 
Now when i told my friends of her inviting me to her dance, they genuinely believed that i guilt tripped her into doing it, and they believed that my friend should've gone with her to her dance. I feel though my intentions were clean, i only wanted to please her, but my friends think otherwise and now it's a bit awkward between me and my friend involved.
(Also by the way; why didn't she just ask my friend to her dance when he asked her to his? She had no idea of my plans, and so there was no reason for her to wait. This gives me hope that she had some feelings for me.)

"AITA for blaming my scheduling manager for me feeling like I need to quit and find a new job?. AITA for blaming my scheduling manager for me feeling like I need to quit and find a new job? 

I bartend in a very nice gentleman’s club that has a private lounge, and I am scheduled in the private lounge 5 shifts a week, with only one of those shifts being at night (when more customers come in). The private lounge is members only, meaning people have to pay a little over a thousand dollars a year to be able to enter this room, and it has very well tipping guests, but they don’t tend to come in until I’m off shift at 9 pm. 

I sit in that room 5 days a week, doing nothing for the majority of my 9-10 hour shifts, making approximately $100 most days with 2-4 customers, while I watch through a one way mirror as the girls in the main room make $200+ with 10+ customers per bar. I have been bartending for a little over a year (which is longer than most of the other daytime bartenders) and am quite good at it. When I do randomly get a shift in the main room, I always do a great job, never have any complaints, and even handle large quantities of guests with no problem. I am fun and energetic and smiley. I have never been able to conceive why my managers refuse to give me either more nights in the lounge, or switch me to the main room on dayshift where I have the possibility of making more money. 

I love the club I work in and my coworkers are great, but the scheduling manager and I have never been super friendly like I am with the rest of the managers. He’s just kind of a harsh person so I tend to keep my distance and just be cordial with him.

Well, I ran into her on campus and saw she was taller than me. I'm already 6' so she was probably like 6'2. She was cute and all, but something about a taller girl just isn't attractive to me.

"AITA for buying my GF less that she bought me for out christmas/anniversary gifts?. The anniversary for my GF (26) and I (27) is 2 days after Christmas, so we pretty much open our Christmas and anniversary presents at the same time (this is out second anniversary and second Christmas together).

I explained to her previously that I wouldn't be able to get her much this year as I'm currently a student and don't have a lot of disposable income (for context my GF is employed full time so currently earns around 4 times more than I do).

When it came to the gifts, I got her:
- a plant (which she has a hobby of collecting)
- an invitation to a spa day and tickets to a museum she said she wanted to go to previously
- I made some homemade pickles as it's one of her favourite foods, and followed the recipie of a chef I know she likes (I also photoshopped my own ""brand logo"" for the jar and stuck it on.
- and I commissioned and artist to draw her 2 dungeons and dragons characters. I printed this onto a poster and gave it her in a frame.

I thought these were thoughtful gifts and was happy with what I had given.

She gave me
- a Nintendo switch
- a £50 Nintendo switch game
- a £50 dungeons and dragons book
- a treasure hunt day out she crafted herself 
- a weekend break in a major city which included a paid for meal at a Michelin star restaurant in the city and a trip to the zoo

These are amazing gifts and I'm so thankful for what she gave me. I was honestly shocked at the amount of things she got me and will admit that I think she got me too much.

My GF and I got into a heated discussion earlier about the gifts, and she said that she doesn't feel that I care about her because 'what she got me was so much more thoughtful than what I got her', and that 'she'd been planning and saving for months to get me all these things' and at one point compared the price points of the gifts. She also said that she thought my gifts were 'last minute gifts'.

She later mentioned that she felt embarrassed telling her friends what I got her, as her friends all all knew what she got me.

"AITA for publicly humiliating a guy who sent me an unsolicited picture of his junk and getting him fired?. I (29F) was playing a dungeons and dragons game at a local game shop that met up through an app and ""Josh"" the DM (22?M) was a part time employee there. We had a game every other Monday with only a few missed sessions and it was all going well. I was happy to play as I usually DM. Then Josh started texting me outside of the group chat.

It was just friendly talk. I was nice back but didn't really push the conversation along. After about 2 weeks of texting he asked about my personal dating life and I told him very clearly that I am gay and have a girlfriend of 4 years. After that he kind of retracted, but he seemed to take it in stride. Everything was fine at our next session

Last Saturday night I was home and he texts asking if I'm awake. I say yes and ask if everything’s ok. He says he wants to hang out. I tell him I'm in for the night with my girlfriend and going to bed soon but (redirecting here) maybe at our next session the whole group can plan a little DND Christmas party. He sends eyeroll emojis and says he'd rather it be us two, but ""maybe \[my\] girlfriend can join too so \[we\] can worship his stallion cock” then sends me a nude. I tell him he's way out of line and he needs to stop texting me before I show everyone in our group. He begs me not to, so I say I won't.

He texts me the next day and apologizes and begs me not to tell anyone. He says he was blacked out and would never do something like that. I told him what he did was unacceptable but if he agrees not to text me inappropriately again I'd forgive him and not mention it. He agreed.

My girlfriend tells me I'm being too nice and I shouldn't forgive him so easily. I thought about it and decided she’s right and I should teach him a lesson. I waited til our next session. He looked nervous when he saw me but I just acted like everything was normal. I waited til everyone got there then briefly excused myself. As I was walking back, I sent a screenshot of my and Josh' text convo. I covered his weiner with eyeroll emojis. Immediate chaos. Josh went white as a sheet and everyone was shouting. He was stammering trying to explain but the store owner came over and yells above the noise and asked what the hell was going on. Everyone looks at Josh but he’s frozen so I hand her my phone to see. She looks and just tells Josh he’s fired and to get the fuck out of her store. He bolts and the owner hands me my phone and walks away.

It was really awkward after that. We all kind of gathered our stuff and made halfhearted plans to start a new campaign and left.

"AITA for making a ‘racist comment’?. The title sounds so stupid but hear me out. 

Also, I’m using a throwaway as I don’t want this to be part of my actual account.

So me and my friend are both Asian. However, we both lived in different environments and he was constantly surrounded by white people whereas I was constantly surrounded by asians.


My friend has other friends who are white and they have names like ‘George’ or ‘Tom’ or ‘Harold’ and I always joked about how his friends  have “white people names.”


I was basically teasing him about how his friends have basic names.

I literally did not mean it to be offensive at all, I just joked as the names were very basic and he kinda snapped at me telling me that I have a basic Asian name and I should “stop being racist.”

Of course he must’ve been pissed off at my constant teasing but I was quite shocked.

I found it so hypocritical of him to say that because once when we were at a shop and the cashier did not give the correct change to him and when we walked out, he called the cashier a “stupid Indian f*ck” (not in front of the cashiers face of course) and I was quite shocked at him for even saying such a thing.

So for him to call me out on being racist about making some stupid joke pissed me off. 


I honestly don’t believe in that reverse racism bs and I believe that anyone can be a victim of racism, weather they are white, black whatever.

But I’m starting to think that maybe my joke was a form of casual racism? I honestly didn’t mean it to be offensive at all and I just thought it was funny and stupid. 

I thought my joke about having basic white names would be like people joking about names like “Chad” or “Karen.”

Being told to stop being racist was a shock for me and now I think that maybe I really was out of line. 

If I was then I’m really sorry and I’ll have to revaluate my morals.






Edit: 
So I just want to say thank you to the people who bothered responding with actual reasoning to their decision.

Also, the reason I mentioned the incident about the cashier was not to point out every mistake my friend has made to make myself feel better or to defend my actions but to point out the hypocrisy- I found it annoying how he said something as terrible as that but then told me to stop being racist and it’s a reoccurring problem because it’s not the first time he had said something like that, yet he suddenly acted like a human rights activist when I said something. 

It just irked me because he acted like he has never said anything wrong in his life and he was targeting me and at that point, I had honestly believed I had done nothing wrong so it upset me.

As for the joke I made about ‘white people names’, the reason I even made such a stupid joke to begin with was because of course, we are Asian so we are not use to seeing English names and seeing such generic/basic names just made me want to take the piss out my friend, just to annoy him a little because he only hung out with white people and he didn’t have many Asian or non white friends. I now realise the joke was dry and insensitive and though some people dismissed it as being minor, others felt offended by it, so I’m sorry if that was you. 


I am against racism. I try my best to be understanding of other races/cultures etc and I have been exposed to other races through out my life. The people I go to school with come from all sorts of ethnic backgrounds. I just rarely see white people in my area. I did not have any bad intentions when joking around because I thought, ‘they are just names, why would people get offended over that?’

I thought that names like ‘Karen’ was often used as jokes by everyone, so I joked about the ‘white people names’ in that sort of context because the entire ‘stereotype’ about Karen is how she’s a middle aged white woman who doesn’t vaccinate her kids and wants to see your manager and I just associated my friends’ white friends as that, but only to annoy him.



However, it was insensitive of me and pretty damn stupid.
I learnt that words can be hurtful and casual racism should not be dismissed so I’ll keep that in mind and I deeply apologise once again to those who have been offended. 


I believe that I am not racist. I already come from a specific background that is discriminated and I would never want someone to feel that way. That doesn’t excuse the dumb stuff I’ve said though, so I’ll try working on myself.

I’ll try better in the future to be careful with what I say and to regard thought into what a person may feel about my words.

"AITA for calling out my community ""youth worker"" for informing me of her concerns about my step-son?. My son (let's call him Jake) is 15 and is quiet, but a really good kid. Kind of like 15 going on 10. Just like other kids his age he likes video games and YouTube etc. We are kind of isolated in our community so there isn't really an opportunity to get out unless we drive him places (which we are happy to do). He went on a community outing today with other kids his age. He arrived back home and seemed happy and had a good time and told me about everything he did.

Then, while I was at work later in an aside, I was informed by my community ""youth worker"" in a ""by-the-way"" fashion, that Jake seemed to be very quiet when in groups of other kids his age (13 years to 16 years) when they were talking about partying, drinking, smoking (cigarettes/drugs) and girls/sex. She said he just kind of sat back and said nothing during these conversations which she observed. She wondered if something was wrong with him and that perhaps we should talk to him to see if something was wrong.

Initially, I thought ""is something wrong?"" but I quickly turned my attitude into ""is there something wrong with you to think the kid being good has an issue?""...

I told her my son, at 15, was perfectly fine being quiet and introverted a bit. Why is NOT drinking, smoking, partying and sex at 14-15 abnormal? I don't need a grandchild next year! Fuck me!

I told her that instead of coming to me with her concerns about my son, perhaps she should go speak with all the other kid's parents about their underage drinking, smoking, drug use, and sex and don't try and say my son has an issue because he is not out getting hammered at 15.

She was certainly taken aback and while I will see her every day I don't have too much respect for her anymore.

"AITA for muting my Wattpad friend?. OK, so, some context.

I once befriended some guy on Wattpad, who will currently remain anonymous. We spoke a lot, read each other's books, and liked them, and I was really happy to have someone who acknowledged my writing.

Recently, he asked me to go talk to some other writer, who will also stay unnamed. He explained that he and that writer were talking until the other guy muted him, and he wanted me to go and find out why.

I spoke to this writer, and here's what he said, quoting him directly:

"" If you're wondering why I muted them.   Look...  If you wanna advertise a book, fine. But don't go claiming you love my book if you've never read it and just randomly vote on some chapters to create the illusion that you do. If they wanna know why I blocked them, that's the reason. ""

I questioned my friend about it, and he denied it at first, but after further pressing, he admitted it. I didn't particularly care that he never read my book, I was just upset that he lied about it, *and* had done the same thing to others, too. After all, our friendship was built on the idea that we both enjoyed one another's books.

After talking to him and telling him that he shouldn't do that to people, I muted him. Was muting him the right thing to do? Should I give him another chance? What do you guys think?",NTA- He’s pretending to read people’s books so they actually read his and provide him with legitimate feedback.

"AITA for being religiously insensitive?. Background info

My fiancee's family is Jewish and I am an atheist (to be clear I am not militant atheist or anything, the only way people know I am one is if they directly ask me and I like to think I am considerate of people's beliefs). Her brother's now wife was asked to convert from Christian to Jew and when she didn't my fiancee's family did not treat her the best. My fiancee does not care if I convert or not. To me converting means nothing and I would basically be doing it in name alone just to make our lives easier. Anyway this came up when I was talking to a friend who is Jewish but not very religious if that matters.

Now on to the part where I may be the asshole.

&#x200B;

I told my friend about me converting and he expressed his surprise as I have never been religious. He was shocked that I would be willing to change my world view like that for my fiancee's family. I explained to him that I was just doing it in name to make my life with my in laws easier and, to me, it would be no different than if he told me he was converting to be a unicorn as his daughter is around that age where she is into that and it would make her happy. He said it is not the same and what I said was insensitive and offensive. AITA?

"AITA for not tipping the waitress?. Note: this is in CA where wait staff must make minimum wage of $11 (maybe $11.5) an hour and tips are extra. 

A new place opened up near me. It’s a bar and grill looking place that is mainly pizza. My girlfriend and I went on Sunday around 1pm and they said we could sit anywhere. So we picked a table, it wasn’t very crowded at all. We sat for at least 10 minutes until someone came to us.  I was trying to make eye contact as staff walked close, but it didn’t work. When she did come she asked if we wanted a drink. No introduction, nothing saying they are understaffed, or a mention of the wait. We ordered soda and our lunch order. She brought the drinks in a normal time. The food came out a little slower than usual, but it wasn’t a problem. She handed it to us and said “oh let me get you silverware.” It took a few minutes and she did and refilled just my drink (even though they were both almost done). But then she never checked back with us. A bit after we were done eating she brought the check and just set it on the table saying something generic like “whenever you’re ready.”  No refill,  no checking how things were, it just felt like we were an inconvenience to her. I usually always tip and well, I haven’t worked food service but I worked retail and know it can be tough. If it’s busy I give them the benefit of the doubt. But it was slow, there were multiple servers for only a handful of tables and she wasn’t nice at all.  I feel guilty for not tipping,  but at the same time, she barely did her job. Am I the asshole?",Not the asshole. Tipping is a sensitive issue but at its core it’s compensation for good service. If you don’t feel you got good service then you have a right to not tip.

"AITA in their eyes? Neighbor's dog got ran over, I went to tell them.. We live in a very rural area, I was driving home when I saw a dog on the side of the road (not uncommon), and swung wide to avoid it, the vehicle behind me didn't. I spun around to check on it, and it's not going to make it.  I didn't want to carry it home (50 yds or so) because it didn't know me, and it's in pain; I figured that's a good way to get bit.

I let them know, and the husband came out to take care of it.  I asked him if he brought something, to put it out of misery. ""Its still alive?"" ""30 seconds ago barely.""
He carried it back to the house, I offered to bury it on my farm because of his kids. I said I'm sorry and drove on.

"AITA: Dad is livid because I asked him not to bring new girlfriend to my wedding.  

Backstory: My dad is the type to constantly be in and out of new relationships. Lately they've lasted around a year. I find it exhausting to constantly be involved with new women, and have expressed that I don't care what he does, but I'd like to not be involved.

Last night, my fiance and father had a conversation where we all agreed to place boundaries on the relationship between us and his girlfriend (this one's been about eight months) - namely that we would only have to be around or interact with her when it had to do with my sister (who is about 8 years younger). This is especially important due to our closeness in age with his girlfriend - my fiance has run into people she's gone to high school with that happen to be friends with this woman while we've been visiting my father and it's extremely uncomfortable. 

I'm getting married in about a month. My fiance is having a surprise bridal shower thrown for her on Saturday. Today, my dad texted me informing me that his girlfriend would be his date for the wedding and all wedding related events (including that she would be attending the bridal shower that neither my dad nor my sister or I would be, thrown for my fiance). I told my dad that we would actually appreciate it if he would attend the wedding solo so that he could focus his attention on being the father of the groom, as opposed to on his new girlfriend. Especially since none of the family have met her yet in the 8 months they've been together, and he is the type to likely go around introducing her to everyone, which I think is inappropriate to do for the first time at my wedding. He flipped. He's livid. My fiance and I think it's a perfectly reasonable request given his history and the boundaries we agreed to last night. He thinks he ""needs to fill the void beside him"" and us asking him to attend alone is the ultimate slight. He refuses to come without her, so we will probably cave and allow her to come. But really, am I the asshole?

Side note: We did not ask him to pay for anything, but he has offered to pay for the cake.",NTA - It's your wedding so your call. I find it to be reasonable especially since none of your family has even met her.,0,0,0,0,1
"WIBTA if I tell the truth about my friend and may get her thrown out of the bridal party. Throwaway for obvious reasons

Okay so I'll give some necessary background information, I'll put an TL;DR at the bottom.

One of my friends is really rich, and the first of us to get married. We'll call her Mia from now on. In our friend group we have 'karen', now Karen has always been a bit defensive and hostile towards Mia. Not enough to have Mia notice this but enough for me to notice.

Mia never made a big deal about being rich, whenever we planned a girls night we would have dinner as places all of us could afford, but she would always cover us if needed. Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.

Now upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding. Now before anyone says anything about it being a destination wedding she will pay for anyone's travel expenses, she will also pay for all our custom made dresses.

Now here is the issue were I could the potential a-hole. Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently. Now Mia has no idea yet, and might throw Karen out of the bridal party if she knows, Mia may be sweet but has a low tolerance for people who are nasty behind her back.

Now of course I don't want Karen to act like this to Mia, I'm not even sure why she is in our close friend group. Although I am not sure if it is my place to tell Mia about this.

So WIBTA if I tell Mia about Karen's behaviour and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

TL;DR my friend is getting married and generous enough to pay for everything, another bridesmaid is being nasty behind her back and now I want to reveal the truth about her and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

Edit: I'll talk to Karen first we are all going for drinks later so I get the chance to talk to her. You guys might be right it could indeed be a misunderstanding. I'll keep you guys updated on how it goes.

Update: okay so I made this post a few hours before seeing either Mia or Karen. Now I have a conclusion for the people who are interested. First off Mia knows, no I wasn't the one who told her. It was her fiancé, so apparently Karen uses her Snapchat as her personal diary and put a whole rant about Mia in her story forgetting that Mia's fiancé is friends with her on snap chat, maybe because he never sends her snaps.

So I went to the maid of honours house for girls night, where I find a crying Mia on the couch. You might ask what happened so let me tell you. Apparently Mia's question to Karen about which shade of blue she would prefer set Karen off so badly she went on a whole rant about Mia on her Snapchat story, saying about how awful she is, how the only reason she stays friends is because of a free vacation and all sorts of nasty stuff. Mia's fiancé sees this and tells Mia immediately, because who could blame him, this happened not even that long ago after I made this post. Well the Snapchat story was made in the afternoon the fiancé just saw it in the evening.

Now me, the maid of honour and the other bridesmaids were all hearing Mia out and comforting her, before Karen shows up. Now the maid of honour went off on her, which I can understand being Mia's best friend and discovering how Mia is being used. Karen now being full on thrown out of our friend group, sees this moment as an opportunity to tell us all off. Blaming Mia's fiancé and saying how he had no right to share this, because that's why you posted in on Snapchat I really don't see Karens logic in this but okay.

Now the truth is out in the open, I was fully prepared to talk to Karen first because it could have been a misunderstanding. But I didn't even got the chance to, thanks to everyone telling me to talk to Karen to make sure it weren't just nasty rumours, even though it wasn't necessary in the end I still appreciate it.

"AITA for not accommodating my friends dietary restrictions?. I have a friend who frequently complains about being lactose intolerant and having a sensitive stomach in general. She brings it up in group settings all the time and says she can’t eat certain things. However, she also often eats those things when she’s on her own or when something looks too good to pass up at a party or dinner out. The result of this is that although she’s constantly talking about her stomach problems and claiming she can’t eat this and that, she often (I would say at least 50% of the time) ends up eating the very things she says she can’t tolerate. 

In the past I’ve gone out of my way to ensure I had food available for her at parties and other gatherings, like I do for all my friends. I have several vegetarian friends, one vegan friend, one friend who doesn’t eat pork for religious reasons and one gluten free friend and I do my absolute best to make sure they have several options whenever we’re getting together or when choosing a restaurant. The difference is that they follow these dietary restrictions 100% of the time and seem to appreciate the effort put in to accommodate them. They also take turns picking restaurants and having people over and they do the same to accommodate each other’s dietary stuff. Whenever I go to the friend in questions house or she brings something to a party or whatever it only meets her own dietary restrictions about 50% of the time. Even if she brings something that does meet her dietary restrictions she’ll also eat everything else provided (and then complain to us later when she doesn’t feel well.) 

So, I have a small Christmas gathering coming up and I want to make mini cheesecakes. I asked one of my friends what she thought and she mentioned our other friends lactose intolerance and how I should pick something that friend can eat but frankly I want to make them anyway. I feel like if she’s not going to be consistent with her restrictions and not even bother to go out of her way to accommodate herself, why should I? Or is this a dumb hill to die on and I should just make some cookies or something instead? AITA?",NTA.  It's really annoying when people complain over and over about something that they have control over.

"AITA for not spending NYE with my girlfriend after she bails on our plans?. This happened a while ago so bear with me as I try to recollect what happened.

&#x200B;

I planned to go to a concert months in advance with my girlfriend at the time for New Years Eve. She agreed, we bought our tickets, housing, and travel and everything was set. We drive a few hours to get there a few days before to settle down and explore, but the day of the concert she gets sick (a cold maybe) and decides not to go to the concert. We have a few other friends coming along, so I was really agitated and repeatedly (maybe 3 times) asked her to confirm if she really didn't want to go. This also wasn't the first time she bailed the day before on a concert, last time also because she got sick, so understandably I was pretty emotional but it was out of our control.

&#x200B;

About 2 hours before the concert I called her one last time to make sure she didn't want to go. I had to resell her ticket last minute because I didn't want it to be wasted, so I wanted to 100% make sure she wasn't going. She flipped out over the phone and turned that against me saying it was her money and I didn't have the right to tell her what to do with it and that I didn't care about her health because I kept trying to convince her to go to the concert despite being sick.

&#x200B;

I figured that if a friend bailed on me last minute, I would also try and convince them to reconsider, especially when we all planned this months ago. I didn't want to bail on my other friends going as well, it wasn't fair to them as we all took a road trip for this concert, so I went to the concert without her.

&#x200B;

She then attacked me saying if I really wanted to spend NYE with her, I shouldn't have gone to the concert and spent time with her (took care of her while she was sick) even though she agreed to spend NYE with me at the concert. I later found out that she went to another party with her female friends and had drinks while ""sick,"" claiming that she didn't want to be alone because I still ended up going to the concert. To be honest, she did not seem sick at all (when I came back at 3am she was still up and being active), though that's not for me to decide. I felt betrayed and when I confronted her she said she felt down at the time and didn't want to go to the concert because it could've made her sickness worse.

&#x200B;

AITA for trying to sell her ticket? AITA for not considering her health? AITA for not spending NYE with her?","Ok wait. So she's angry she was sick and you went to a concert you had planned for months - so she went to a party herself whilst sick and is still mad at you?

NTA, my friend. My boyfriend would have pushed me out the door and even given me some money for a drink on him. It's only because you made her feel like she wasn't the most important that she's pissed about. She wasn't sick. I'm glad you went and made use of the tickets otherwise what a huge waste of time and money. You showed her how much you wanted her to go, asked and asked and asked. Not once did she ask you not to go.

"AITA for being angry at my mother for forcing me into being a vegetarian. Context: I am 16 years old and live with my mother and older brother. Up until about 4 years ago my mother wasn't a vegetarian and would eat meat. Ever since she became vegetarian she tried forcing me and my brother into also becoming vegetarian and for a few months she even tried to make us vegan.

Through all of this time neither I or my brother wanted to be a vegetarian/vegan, but she doesn't care about that. She even talked multiple times about making our 2 cats vegetarians.

In my opinion everybody should choose for them selves and ONLY for themselves whether or not they want to turn vegetarian/vegan, but my mother doesn't see it like that. She thinks that she's doing the right thing forcing us.

Now we get to present day, I bought meat from MY money for myself, and put it in the fridge in the kitchen.

Right after that I get up and take it out of the fridge and put it into my mini fridge in my room(I didn't instantly put it in there because she doesn't want it to be turned on over night).

"AITA for wanting my mom to completely stop shit-talking my dad to me?. For context, I am a teenager and my parent are divorced. I spend close to equal time with both my parents, but slightly more with mom. The divorce occurred because my dad cheated on my mom. He married the woman he had an affair with. 
I do not hold any particular hard feelings towards either my dad or my stepmom. I acknowledge that they both did a shitty thing and the fact that my dad is a bit of a narcissist, but I still love him and respect my step-mom. 
My mom continuously states that she is over the affair and that she does not hate my dad (they are fairly good at communicating with each other when the matter is myself or my brother) yet she still shit-talks him directly to me. She will continuously emphasize that he is a narcissist and bring up the affair, and just strait up call my stepmom names. I can't stand this. 
When she first told me that they were getting a divorce, I already knew of the affair. They had already been living apart for several years and I had honestly thought they were already divorced. This obviously wasn't the case though, so I didn't really care. The one thing I did care about, though, was the fact that I specified to my mom that I would not accept her shit-talking my dad to me. She said she wouldn't. 
Fast forward to now, she continuously does it. She'll specifically bring up how narcissistic he is, names she calls my stepmom, how he told her he wanted to end the marriage, accounts of when she felt upset because she suspected his affair, and essentially telling me stories and details that I feel she should be telling her friends rather than her daughter. 
Just a little while ago we were talking about my birthday (the 24th) and about how my mom took me and my brother trick or treating on Halloween just a week after I was born because she loved the holiday so much. My stepmom has two daughters who we were friends with (they live with their dad in another state) so she was with us alongside my dad. My mom goes on to talk about how my dad and stepmom (specifically dad) had been kind of pressuring her to go home and rest and leave them with the kids since she was feeling shitty (obviously. it had just been a week since she pushed me out). She talks about how she suspects they had already been having an affair. I hadn't been expecting an unpleasant memory at all, since NOTHING we have been talking about leading up to this even mentioned my dad or anything negative. We were just talking about how my birthday and Halloween were coming up. 
I have asked her multiple times to stop and she continuously tells me that she ""tries but it's hard since it impacted her so strongly.""

"AITA for not telling my best friends wife he was cheating on her?. I've been debating this for weeks and I'm still unsure. 

My best friend, a guy (I'm female) has been having an affair, it's not the first time he has done something like this. The wife knew about one instance and forgave it. He didn't leave because he thought they could fix it and I think she was always scared to leave him. 

 I'm absolutely not defending his behaviour other than to say they were unhappy and its simply taken a long time to leave her because she kept putting that decision on him. They had issues but nothing huge, just small things that pilled up, another reason why it took so long for things to end. 

A few weeks ago we had a talk and he let slip that he's been playing around, I had a suspicion but he refused to tell me due to knowing I'd lose my shit. After he told me, it took another week for him to end his nearly two decade long marriage and I felt relived that it was finally done. 

My issue is, am I an asshole for not going to her with my suspicion that he was cheating? Bare in mind I've know her as long as I've known him but he is my friend, she was simply a friend through being his wife. Some part of me feels like it would have ended sooner if I'd told her, maybe saving her time she could have spent recovering but probably destroying my friendship with my bf in the process. Some part of me has that need for female solidarity and feels like I betrayed the sisterhood. One reason I didn't tell her was because he said he was ending it eventually, even when I had my suspicion months ago, he was adamant he was ending his marriage it was just about when. So I figured it would be better if she didn't know. That last part is void because she now knows and she's furious (rightly so). 

It's just an awkward situation and I'm not sure if I should have done things differently? AITA here?","NTA- it’s not your marriage, plus what if your suspicions had turned out to be wrong? You’d have started a lot of drama over nothing.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for refusing to borrow my Spotify Premium account to one of my friend?. Hello Reddit, I just need to say that I’m french, so I may be making some grammatical mistakes so I’m sorry for this.
Edit* : Someone told me, in english you say « lend » except of « borrow » so I am sorry for this mistake in the title. I tried to replace the words ;)

Anyway, I am a 17 years old boy, and my friend at school has the same age. We both like listening to music and especially the same artist, he actually listened to music by downloading them on his iPhone. 
First, I was like very surprised because usually, if you really like listening to music, buying a Premium account isn’t a problem if you enjoy it. 
But anyway, we talked a lot and, for the first time after many months, he asked me if I was agree to lend my Spotify Premium account...
I knew that he was my friend and he won’t do anything stupid because my account is linked to my personal Gmail account. I was like « Man, I’m so sorry buy I can’t do that, it’s like I’m giving you my credit card or something, I know it’s just for listening your fav songs but it is linked to my personal account and even if you won’t do anything stupid, I actually can’t »
He was OK, he accepted my decision (I didn’t expect this reaction by the way) but he started to stop talking to me like we were doing. 
I think, inside him he was really pissed off and I was really confused 😐.

I am actually about to come back to my decision and maybe lend him my account...

Am I the asshole for not lending my Spotify Premium account to a good friend?","NTA - people who are your friend under the expectation that you will give them things arent really your friends. If that's the case, then you can find better friends.

Also, for the sake of clarity, I think you meant lend, not borrow. It's a common mistake, but the person giving is the lender and the person receiving is the borrower.

"WIBTA if I skipped Christmas with my family?. A few pieces of background information important to the story: 

1. I’m disabled and have a lot of physical pain issues as well as frequent seizures. 
2. My sister, Rose, moved in with my parents a few months ago and has three tiny dogs that yap like crazy when I visit with my dogs. The only way to get them to stop is to have Rose go down into the basement apartment where she lives with them. 
3. My dogs are calm and listen when we visit and don’t cause issues outside of one of them being so clingy that she wants to lay with my mom when she wants to be left alone. 
4. My other sister, Marie, and her three kids have also moved in with my mother sometime over the past few weeks. I love and am close with her kids, but her and I do not have a relationship whatsoever. 

My mother called me today to talk about the time for our Christmas Eve dinner at her house with everyone sleeping over so we can wake up and do gifts and stockings in the morning. 

My boyfriend and I planned to go up around 6:00 pm with my pups so we could be a part of the holiday. We live about two hours away so when I go up, because of my different health issues, I have to spend the night for safety’s sake. Four hours of round trip plus all the socializing would take too much out of me. So the plan would’ve been for my boyfriend, the dogs, and I to sleep in my nephews room and have him stay on the pull-out bed in the couch. 

My mother dropped a bomb on me today that she wants me to board my dogs when I come up. She says that it’ll be too stressful to have Rose’s dogs non-stop yapping the whole holiday and she doesn’t want Rose to have to be downstairs with them because then we’d all get no time with her. The dogs can’t intermingle because her dogs have bit mine in the past. One of my dogs we’ve had less than a year and we’re looking forward to spending our first Christmas with her. The other dog is 14 and I rescued her 9 years ago. She was my service dog the majority of her life and she is part of the family as a whole. This will unfortunately likely be her last Christmas. She’s not in any pain or miserable, but does have a tumor that will cause issues within the year. We also have stockings for the dogs and really don’t want to board them over the holiday. 

I’m considering not attending. I don’t want to have to board my dogs, the trip and festivities will be hard on my body when I’ve had a especially bad few weeks health-wise, and being around my sister Marie is always a huge stressor. My seizures are stress-induced and every time Marie and I are around each other there’s some sort of drama or she tries hard to make the time as upsetting for me as possible. With all of these factors added together it just doesn’t seem worth it to me when I can have a nice holiday at home with my little family here. 

WIBTA?",NTA - Telling you to board your dogs just two or three days before a peak holiday is NOT enough time for you to organize to do so.

"AITA for not being what my parents want me to be?. 
Using a throwaway due to anxiety.

I'm a 15 year old and am nonbinary. I figured this out back in February of this year, and after lots of prayer (I'm a Christian), came out to my parents back in late June. 

That.. Didn't really go well. The night I sent my coming out letter by Email, they came into my room and explained they were taking me to their religious counselor. They didn't say anything relating to the whole nonbinary situation, but the fact that they announced this on the day I came out was just too fishy to me, so I prepared for the worst.

Day of the appointment rolls around and the counselor treats me like I'm being controlled by demons if I take too long to respond to a question, has me repeat some long prayers, assumes I'm a trans man, and my parents overall seemed to trust her judgement more than my feelings.

Anyways. Since then, they've rifled through my tablet a few times, which resulted in them discovering my grandmother was supportive of me, which seems to have made them think I was brainwashed by her. That really wasn't the case at all, and it spiraled off into some more family drama which I don't want to get into. All I'll really say is that I'm not allowed to be with her without supervision anymore.

They don't use my chosen name or they/them pronouns when referring to me despite me having told them that it really hurts me when they don't refer to me like this. They also disallow me from purchasing clothes from the mens' department, which I'm more comfortable in. They have told me I'm not allowed to go by a different name or pronouns while I'm under my roof and that as long as I'm living with them I AM a girl, which is frankly very painful to think about.

That's my side of the story.

My parents have done most of the non-supportive things for religious reasons. They believe that being transgender or nonbinary is against the Bible, and thus, a sin. Which I understand, I really do. I believe that people should be allowed to practice their religion as long as nobody's getting hurt or harassed.

They've also argued that when I was a child and even now as a teenager, sewing, dolls, and a few other ""girly"" things are things that I'm interested in. When I was a child, but not now, I also liked makeup and dresses. In their eyes, how could I not be a girl if I liked/like these things?

They've given me everything in life and I feel selfish about being upset about them not accepting me, and I feel like an asshole for not shutting up and trying to be what they want. 

I haven't fought back, insisted that they try to accept me, or anything like that, since their reaction caused me to stop trusting that they'd listen to me instead of making assumptions or taking me back to their counselor.

I apologize if this isn't fleshed out enough. Am I the asshole here for not being a girl? And am I the asshole for wanting to escape and change my legal name as an adult? 

Thanks.","NTA. Jesus' apostles also went through a transformation and their names changed to.

"WIBTA if I didn’t care about my pregnant aunt?. So using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Just a little background:
I’m a kid nearing the end of my teenage years in about a year or so. I live with my aunt and my uncle because my parents are both not available to look after me. 

When I was around 5 my mum, aunt and I lived together in an apartment. My aunt looked after me most of the time because mum was almost always at work. Coz we’re Asian, she decided to make me learn maths at a very young age. Whenever I can’t do a maths question, she wouldn’t let me eat dinner and would call me dumb and incompetent. Also at that time I couldn’t speak my native language that well and whenever I messed up she would hit me with a metal coat hanger. This continued until my mum and I moved states. 

We came back after a few years and moved to a house grandma bought for us. My aunt also lived in this house with her fiancé. Now I thought the insults would stop because I’ve gotten a bit older but it didn’t. She called me ugly bitch, stupid child etc... she also stole my iPad that I got as a gift from another relative.

Now we move houses again but his time it’s just me, my aunt and her husband. Although we live in the same house we don’t talk to each other frequently. I don’t like her, She doesn’t like me but my mum still forces us to communicate together. 

Present: 
So recently there was an incident with the washing machine where I prematurely took out the blankets I washed before they were nearly dried. I didn’t see that the washing machine had a spin function because I probably missed it as I had a lot on my mind (my exams start in a few days and I haven’t been entirely focused on my surroundings). My aunt saw this and she started screaming like I had just murdered someone. I honestly thought it wasn’t a big deal because they’ll dry...but she thought otherwise. She started calling me stupid and dumb and insulting me again. I tried explaining to her that I didn’t see the spin function but she cut me off and said that I was always making excuses when I did something wrong. While I admit I’m wrong i had an explanation as to why and starting insulting me again.

Tl;dr:  my aunt keeps insulting me. I don’t like her and she doesn’t like me and her husband basically agrees with every his wife says like a lapdog. 

So WIBTA if I stopped doing things that she asked me to do because she’s pregnant and be petty? Or do I still do them because she is pregnant?","NTA

I use this lesson parents teach their children on adults who don't know how to treat other people, ""If they don't know how to play nice, they don't get to play at all"".

Your aunt isn't communicating with you in a respectful way, so don't communicate with her unless she does. The next time she acts aggressively, I'd let her know that you will no longer be responding to her when she behaves this way. She'll freak out, she'll tell your mom. Stick to your guns.

You're an adult now. There's only so much control she has over you, even if it doesn't feel like it. You have to re-train her how to treat you and draw firm boundaries",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for not wanting to attend my partner's family's Christmas Eve event?. My partner and I (few years out of college) have been together around 3 months now, and in the beginning of December, she casually mentioned that every Christmas her family has all of the kids and their SO's come back for a Christmas Eve lunch. At the time I told her I would love to go, but that I wanted to double check my work schedule to see if I could get the 23rd off as well so we could enjoy a few days together.

When I had asked back in August for my holiday days (my work has a compliance requirement where at least 1 member of a team have to be in if others plan on taking vacation) I only asked for the 27th off (already get 25 and 26 off) since my coworker will have to fly back to Seattle for Christmas with his family, and my family lives locally (East Coast). Because of this, when I checked back in at work they told me I couldn't take the day, and I don't want to put my coworker in that sort of situation.

I did want to spend time with her family, but because I won't be getting the 23rd off, I'm reluctant to make the trip. Her family is based 6 hours away driving, and I realistically wouldn't be able to get on the road until after 8pm. (Strapped for $$ atm, train takes way longer). She is planning on going up on the 22nd, without me. She also just mentioned that the lunch event will last until 5PM, meaning I also wouldn't be able to get home in time for my own family's Christmas Eve celebrations. I value my time with my family a ton, as although they live an hour away we only see each other 1-2 times every other month.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to make the trip for her family lunch event? When I mentioned my concerns she immediately shut down on me and said I didn't care about her feelings at all.

"AITA for refusing to avoid a girl that makes my gf uncomfortable?. My GF [22F] and I [24M] have been dating for about 6 months now. I’ve known that she has trust and abandonment issues from her past relationships. She dislikes one of my best friends [25F], whom I’ve known for about a year longer than GF. Let’s call her “Jane.” There has never been anything (sexual or romantic) between her and I. I tend to befriend more girls than guys, so it’s normal for me.

GF cites a couple reasons for not liking Jane. 
1. They met was at my Halloween party. Jane came with a larger group of friends and they were all drunk already. From the moment Jane got there, all she talked about was how excited she was to meet GF. When GF got there, they briefly introduced each other and GF went to hang out with her friends that she invited. Jane kept asking me when she’d be able to really meet GF. In her drunken state, Jane tried to discreetly whisper this to me. Aware that it could cause a misunderstanding, I make sure to keep a reasonable distance and never make any physical contact; I even tried to bring Jane to where GF was but GF didn’t seem interested in talking to Jane. Afterwards, GF was mad and didn’t allow me to explain anything because that would be “defending” Jane.
2. GF said she would give Jane “a second chance” when I invited GF to come to a bday party at Jane’s apartment. I was already in a bad mood bc of my then-roommate who is an asshole (we were still “best friends” then but that’s a different story). At one point, I got very hungry, ordered delivery, and ate it in the lobby away from people to not be rude. GF came out eventually and said she’d go to the bathroom and be right back. After a few minutes, Jane comes out and asks why I’m eating outside. Jane says to just go eat in her room and that there’s a lot of people hanging out there. Knowing how bad this was going to look, I insist on staying and that I’m waiting for GF to come back. Jane tells me that GF is in the balcony smoking weed with my roommate, then grabs my food, and tells me to just text GF that I’ll be eating upstairs. I’m even more anxious at this point and quickly text GF to come back and shows up before we went upstairs. Jane takes us to her room, where there were indeed other people. We had an argument, couldn’t explain; same thing.

Because of personal reasons, GF moved back home indefinitely and we’ve been in a LDR for 3 months. GF says that because we are doing distance and Jane makes her uncomfortable, I should avoid anything related to Jane, such as: liking pics on facebook and instagram, talking to her, and being anywhere Jane might also be at. GF says she’d even expect me to leave a place or party if Jane is also there, at least for as long as we’re in a LDR. Because I transferred schools, I rarely see my friends anyway and this just makes it even harder because Jane may be where they are.

So, am I being “disrespectful” to our relationship by refusing to avoid my friend?","NTA

Your girlfriend sounds incredibly insecure, and the fact you guys dated for only 6 months and she was this threatened by your friend is a huge red flag.

Before what comes next: I see them in various places on my commute, and they drive very slowly. Nothing against slow drivers, but people, including me, get around them because we are in a rush to get to work. 

So I decide enough is enough, and honk at them while they’re blocking the road considering the laws and the somewhat inconvenience it causes. Immediately after doing so, the woman proceeds to chase me down in my car screaming at me while I’m parking.

My boyfriend and I have been adjusting to long distance and when I go to visit him he always wants to get crabs and throughout our whole relationship I've had to bug him to brush his teeth. Today he got upset with me because I asked him not to get crab because I am going home and I won't see him for a few months and he said that he had to because there was a buffet (he lives 10 minutes away from this place) and I was hurt he had to do this today rather than another time when I'm not here.

"WIBTA if I was maid of honor for my brother's ex and the guy she cheated on my brother with?. My brother and his ex dated during college and the few years right after. They met because he was visiting me on campus and she lived on the same floor. My brother is only a year older and we have always been super close. During these formative years, she went from a casual acquaintance to being one of the few people I can truly be myself with. 

Toward the end of their relationship, she was really unhappy. She went to grad school so they were doing long distance. She felt my brother wasn't putting as much work into their relationship as she was. She had a flirtatious relationship with a classmate that finally crossed a line one night. My brother forgave her, but she broke up with him anyway. They remained on friendly terms after the break up and continued to see each other with mutual friends whenever she was in town.

About six months after the break up, she told me she and the guy were dating. I'll admit, I thought the new guy was going to be a tool, but after meeting him a few times, I actually really like him. He takes care of her way better than my brother ever did. They seem truly happy.

About a year after their breakup, I ended up moving to a city near her for work. For a lot of the minor holidays I'll go see her or she'll come see me instead of going home. I asked my brother if that was ok the first time I did it. He said it didn't bother him.

My friendship with his ex wasn't a problem until my brother started dating someone about eight months ago. I've gotten scolded for mentioning trips I've done with his ex. I've gotten scolded for wearing a shirt my brother and his ex gave me on a vacation they took together. I've gotten asked to remove the tag of myself from a group photo with his ex on Instagram. I've never intentionally tried to ostracize his new girlfriend, but he said these things make her feel like an outsider / a replacement. My brother's girlfriend has never expressed these feelings to me. We're friendly. We chat in a group chat every week, but we're not close. Part of that is because we live in different cities.

Now my brother's ex is engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor. I told her I'd have to think about it (now she's a bit peeved at me too). I'm going to go to her wedding regardless because I'm not missing my best friend's wedding. My brother and his gf are just going to have to deal with that.

"AITA for essentially telling this woman to fuck off and advising my grandparents to do the same?. Okay, so once in a while something so bizarre happens that you have to question whether you are, in fact, the asshole. 

A few days ago I got a call out of the blue from a woman saying she was my grandparents neighbor. She said that in the spring of 2008, my grandfather was backing out of his driveway and hit her truck. She said that she is now trying to sell the truck and wants my grandparents to pay her $900 for repairs. She got my number from our other neighbor, who knows that I take care of the house, water the plants, etc while my grandparents are away. She says that she has been trying to contact my grandparents but has not been able to do so, which is why she called me. She apparently also got my father's number and has contacted him. I asked my grandparents, and my grandma ""vaguely"" remembers something happening but my grandfather doesn't remember. The woman told me she ""may"" have filed a police report and is trying to get the details.

This REEKS of scam.  The statute of limitations for filing a claim is long gone (usually 2-4 years; contact your grandparents' insurance company to be certain).  She has zero standing.

If you have an attorney I'd encourage you to have her contact the attorney, who will probably tell her to fuck right off.  If she wants to pursue this she'll have to get her own attorney, who will likely tell her this is unwinnable.  Finally, your grandfather has insurance.  This is what it's for.

We both live at home with our strict black parents. We both live in Canada where the age to drink/smoke weed is 19. Some of this info may be unnecessary, but I am not really sure what kind of context you guys need to make your judgement.   

My parents are leaving for a week on vacation and leaving me and my brother at home alone. He wants to have his friends over and smoke/drink while they are gone.

I don't want him to do this for multiple reasons. Firstly I don't want him to do this as him and his friends are all minors and I am the only adult there so if somehow the cops show up (I know unlikely) I will most likely get in a lot of trouble. Secondly I don't like the idea of lying to my parents as they are trusting me to make sure this kind of stuff does not happen. My parents and I have a pretty good relationship and I know if I let him do this and they found out they would never trust me. Lastly I don't want any of his friends to break stuff in our house or the neighbours asking my parents why people are coming over and have to worry about making up some lie to cover up (I guess this is the same as not wanting to lie).

He is saying that them coming over has no effect on me (which is kind of true) and that I am being a party pooper. I don't mind if he smokes/drinks at his friends but I don't feel comfortable with him doing this at our house.

I choose not to smoke/drink (if that is relevent) but I don't care if others do. My main problem is with it happening at our house. Regardless I will get final say as to whether this happens or not, as if I tell him not to have them over he won't, but he might keep his plans to himself in the future (which is fine I guess).

"AITA: My roommates are being kicked out and I can stay. Hey, all! I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible, but I need some advice. I live in Los Angeles and, a few months back, I met two film students/siblings via Facebook and agreed to let them move in and sublet the extra bedroom in my apartment. Instantly, there were problems. They were both sweet and kind, and lots of fun to hang out with, but the youngest sibling began using my things, eating my food, and taking my edibles without asking. They also were always arguing with my puppy (who, at the time, was only 4 months old and was hyper as all hell) and leaving all sorts of messes around the apartment. The youngest also couldn't pay rent two months in a row because she was waiting for her financial aid money to come through and it was late; I fronted her and got mostly paid back when the money came in. However, she blew through the 10,000 dollars within a single month and, by January, she needed me to front her rent again.

Now, backing up, in November, we decided to move to a nicer apartment complex that was closer to their school. The place was super nice and we all loved it, but only my credit (I work full time and work hard on my credit) was high enough to get on the lease. I told them that they could move in with me, but it'd be an illegal sublet and they'd have to be aware of that.

So, back to January- we get a notice from the landlord saying that they have 3 days to leave or put themselves on the lease. Their credit is each TERRIBLE and they can't get approved on their own; I told them to find cosigners so that we can approach the landlord with a solution by the end of the deadline. They've been trying, but it's not working out. I don't know what to do. I have three pets and the landlord was really nice not to kick me out, too. One of them never pays rent, doesn't have a job, and they're both messy. They also always expect me to pay for ubers to stores, the movies, etc. They eat my food, use my gaming systems, borrow my clothes, and whatnot. I feel more like they're my kids and I'm taking care of them rather than feeling like they're my roommates. My parents and sister say that they've been taking advantage of my kindness for months and vote that I should let them move out and find someone else older and more responsible to put on the lease. The siblings are acting like that's selfish of me. I DID explain to them the risks of moving to the new place and I DO care about them. However, I'm exhausted. I'm tired of taking care of them and I can't risk my pets and I being thrown out onto the street. I also don't want an eviction on my credit. If they'd been great roommates up until now and asking for me to handle things was a rarity, it'd be different. But, I'm just so...tired.

TL;DR: My roommates are getting kicked out for our illegal sublet arrangement and I'm not sure I want to risk losing my dream apartment to help them stay. Am I the asshole?","NTA at least how you've described it. You aren't their parent, you cannot be responsible for them.

"AITA for finding my step mom immature?. First time using a throwaway, going to be as vague as possible since my dad knows this subreddit exists. Sorry for formatting and grammar, mobile user.

Context: parents are divorced, dad got married to step mom two years ago but dated for a couple before that.

I’ve had an okay relationship with my stepmom, it was better when they were dating but it’s whatever. We usually clash over minimal stuff like cleaning and food, as I sometimes bring snacks over and hide them from them since they’re kinda health nuts. But it’s not that big a deal and we usually get over it.

However, my dad makes it a point to wherever we do clash he asks me to stop/not to do it in the first place because she ‘b!tches and moans’ about it to him and how he’s gotta listen to it all day. If it was once it would’ve been fine but this is happening like every other week. One thing she’s complained about is me making a mess when I got to stay home alone which is completely fair (this ties in I promise). So it can be ruled out that I can’t stay by myself. 

So apparently, my stepmoms family invited all their kids and grandkids (and my stepmom + dad) to go on a cruise. Without me or my brother. They can do whatever they want, that’s fine, but my dad didn’t go because he thinks it’s rude to go on a vacation without your kids (we weren’t even invited, so I didn’t know this until he told me). Stepmom tried to bring brother, but his mom said no. I was never asked. Of course I would’ve never gone because of school (and bc I can’t stay alone) but I thought it wouldn’t of been a big deal to be asked to show that I’m apart of their family. Even when she was leaving to go to her parents with a suitcase full of close she still didn’t tell me where she was going. 

It turns out our fall break vacation of hanging out in Texas was really to pick her up from her cruise, which I thought was really dumb, but I admire my dad for turning it into something me and my brother could have fun doing. 

When I asked why she wouldn’t tell me about it, he kind of mocked her like ‘well I just- I don’t wanna-‘. So I don’t really have an answer, but I know that had my dad not told me, I would’ve never known.

This is where the AITA part comes in. Is it too much to ask to have her (if she has an issue with me) to tell me directly instead of my dad? Or if something happens and me or my brother aren’t included, she can just tell me instead of acting like the issue doesn’t exist? Am I asking for too much as a step-daughter?","NTA

While I can imagine being a step parent can be really difficult, she's gone about this completely the wrong way. It sounds like even your dad has had enough of her too.

"AITA For ghosting my best friend when his dad died?. To give some background, this happened when I was 15, my friend was 16.

We met in highschool, and we became best friends, and were really good friends for a long time before all this happened.

One day, out of nowhere, he started treating me like if I was his girlfriend. He started holding my hand under the table, and hugging me romantically, and I didn't like it. Some time later, he said that he LOVED me, that he was in love with me, but no physically, emotionally and personally, however, he physically treated me like his girlfriend. I told him to stop and that I didn't feel comfortable, he said that he was going to stop, but he didn't.

One day, he called me and told me that his dad died. He came back from school and saw his dad sitting on the couch watching tv, he said hi to him, but he didn't respond. My friend told me that his dad did that sometimes, he would stay still until he started laughing. But this time it was different, he didn't move. So my friend leaned over and look at him in the eyes, expecting for his dad to react, but he didn't. He was dead. And my friend looked at his dad dead in the eye... literally.

When he told me this I felt really bad and I really wanted to be there for him. I genuinely loved him too, but as a friend, not a lover.

I tried to not think about him being romantic with me, since I knew he was having a hard time and maybe being like that with me was some sort of relief for him?

One day, we were at the bus stop, he grabbed both of my hands and pulled me closer and kissed me twice. I tried to shrug it off but I couldn't. That was the limit for me. He asked me to give him a kiss before, MULTIPLE TIMES and I ALWAYS said no. I really tried to put up with his shit because we were friends and I cared and his dad died, but I felt kinda violated and like he betrayed me and my trust because I never consented to ANY of this. I even told him that I wasn't comfortable, but he never stopped. I even started thinking that maybe he took advantage of his dad dying so he could get closer to me? But it makes me feel very guilty to think about him that way, because I want to believe that he wasn't that kind of person.

He started going to another school, and we didn't see each other as often as before, but we still hung out sometimes, I was expecting for him to not be a dick tho. We started to separate more and more, but he still talked to me on facebook, and I always tried to come up with some excuse to not see him. One day he told me that he really missed me and ""our old days"", and I just answered with a sad face. I think he got the clue and never talked to me anymore. So... I ghosted him not so much after him after his dad died... and I now think that maybe I could've handled the situation better?.

"AITA For asking a couple not to break check me in front of their kid?. There's a large dog park in the city I live in. Went there for lunch today and the one way parking lot traffic was going about 30 mph. The car in front of me slammed on their breaks, immediately threw it into a fast reverse almost hitting my car, and then waived furiously at me to back up three spaces for a spot they'd missed. There was a car behind me and it took a minute but we did it. I parked at a space a while down and saw the people get out of the car (a younger couple and their maybe 12 YO son).

"AITA for making noise?. So I'm a freshman in college. I have a roommate, and we don't get along too well. We don't hate each other, but we don't particularly like each other.

Here's the thing: she sleeps a lot. I was known at home for almost always sleeping, and she sleeps more than I do. The issue comes with her also being a much lighter sleeper than I am, and generally going to bed earlier than I do or napping more than I do. That means that a) when I come back into my room, she's asleep a lot of the time, and b) sometimes just opening the door wakes her up.

I've recently decided to be a little bit more assertive, though. She takes a nap pretty much daily after class - as in, once she left ten minutes before I did, I went to work for three hours, ran back to my room to grab something I forgot for my class, and she was already asleep again. It feels like I'm not even allowed to use my own room. So my question is: if I come in my room in the middle of the day and start making a reasonable amount of noise (like moving stuff, closing drawers, typing), AITA? On one hand, it's my room too, and I'm allowed to be in it. On the other, she can't really wake me up since I could sleep through a hurricane and an earthquake happening simultaneously, so it's not really fair to wake her. I can provide more details about how we coexist if you need them.",I don't think you're the asshole. She should get some ear plugs if she wants to sleep all day.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for never wanting to travel with my mother again?. I’m currently traveling in Japan with my mother. I originally planned this trip with a good friend of mine, who I was supposed to go with. But because my mother insisted she wanted to go, it became so that I had to go separate ways with my friend and go with my mother instead. 

I originally didn’t think too much of this, and I was not unhappy about the arrangement, but a week into travel I am really regretting all of this. 

From the beginning she was quite frank that she didn’t want to put any effort into planning, and she wanted me to do all of it. So throughout the planning phase, she refused to participate at all. Whenever I asked her something, it would be “oh, I don’t know. You decide”. When I pressed the question, she would get annoyed at me and call me indecisive. I was very frustrated about this because this is a trip for the two of us and I want her to enjoy it as well so I wanted her input on where she wants to go/stay and what she wanted to see/do. However, since she refused to participate, I just had to guess at what she might like to do in Japan. It was frustrating, but I settled with this for the most part. 

Things started becoming not okay once we arrived in Japan. Literally everywhere I take her to, she would have a complaint for. For instance, because she likes shopping, I took her to some very popular high-end shopping malls (Isetan, Marui, etc) in Tokyo. Once we got there, she took one look inside and said that everything is too expensive so she didn’t want to shop there. I suggested that she didn’t have to buy anything, and it might be enjoyable just to have a look, but she insisted that that’s a waste of time. Then I took her to some popular and fairly priced shops but she said that she didn’t want any of that “cheap Chinese stuff”. I was honestly mildly offended at this comment because shops like Uniqlo is very well-received and by no means is “cheap Chinese stuff”.  I asked her what kind of shops she would like to go to instead, it’s again just “I don’t know, you decide”. At this point I was getting annoyed but I knew if I let out any hint of annoyance we’d fall into argument and the rest of the trip would be miserable. I just figured maybe she didn’t want to shop, so I tried some famous tourist attractions instead, but at attractions she would constantly complain that she is bored and tired and want to go back to the hotel.. 

Dining is the same. I would ask her, what she would like to eat, she would say “I don’t know. Anything is fine”. But when I actually then take her to a restaurant, she’d be unhappy about my choice or say things like “We should’ve gone to eat xxx instead”. If that’s the case then why didn’t you say so!!!! 

For some reason, my mother expects me to know Japan like the back of my hand and gets hugely upset whenever I have to stop to look at the map or I lead her in the wrong direction for a moment. Her reasoning is that I have been here before. While this is true, that was when I was *five years old*. Pardon my memory but I really can’t remember anything from before I was 10. On top of that, she was the one who took me there so she should have equal (if not more) experience. Japan has really massive and busy cities. I think no matter how much effort I put into doing homework before hand, I’m still not going to be able to navigate this place as if I have a GPS of Japan installed in my brain. 

She is making me feel like I can’t do anything right. Whatever I do, it’s a mistake, whether it’s the places I take her to, the food that I choose, the turns I take. Feeling upset about this, I suggested maybe she could put some effort into planning instead, if she is unhappy about my planning. She gets really angry at this and said that it was my responsibility because I’m (apparently) more familiar with Japan. I’m okay with doing all the work, but it really hurts that while I’m trying my best to accommodate her, she is unhappy about everything that I do. Also it’s not like she’s very elderly in which case of course I should try my best to lighten her load. She’s in her late 40s, for reference. 

There is one more thing she does that is really irritating to me. Japan has HUGE and very busy subway stations, and every station has a lot of escalators. The etiquette here is that everyone who wants to ride the escalator while standing still should stand on the left of the escalator, leaving space on the right side for people who are in a hurry to catch their trains to run/walk up it. My mother, however, always insists on standing on the right side of the escalator because it’s “less crowded” and refuse to move over to the left when I ask her to because she says it’s her privilege as a foreign visitor to stand on the right side. Because of this, she’s constantly holding up a bunch of people on the escalators who are in a hurry to get to their trains. I’m constantly having to apologise to everyone for her behavior. She would then always go off on me about how I shouldn’t apologise to them because she’s apparently entitled to stand there. 

I really looked forward to this trip for over a year, but she’s just making the entire trip a really miserable experience for me. Instead of enjoying Japan, I find myself completely stressed out trying but failing to accommodate to her wishes. I also feel really sad about this because being a broke uni student, the trip was something I saved for a long time for so I really wanted to enjoy it. I know deep down that I am a total asshole for being annoyed about this because she’s my mother so it doesn’t matter what she does I must pay her respect and do what she asks. I keep swearing to myself I’m never travelling with her again but I also feel like maybe I’m just being a terrible daughter for her for thinking this. 

AITA?

I (25f) and my fiancé (24m) have been through Hell and back together and been through stuff that would have broken other couples up but has only made us stronger and more sure of each other. My fiancé’s mom hasn’t always been my biggest fan but insists she’s 100% behind this wedding and has told me numerous times she loves me and I’m part of the family now. My fiancé and I are both in school and doing a LDR right now and although it’s hard, we’re doing really well. Our original wedding date was July 18, 2020 and my family was going to arrange the wedding in my home state. His parents weren’t fans of this and offered to do it in their state instead. Today his mom called me and told me they would be the only people from my fiancé’s family in attendance because nobody else could afford to go. My fiancé and I have differing schedules off to see our families and the wedding ceremony was legitimately just for our families to be together... since this isn’t happening I don’t feel the need to wait to do a “big” ceremony and offered to move it to NJ this break as my fiancé and I both have the time off school. I realize it’s short notice but told them since they were already planning an engagement party for us, all the arrangements for that would be fine. My mom said she’d help decorate, buy our cake etc, and they’d make sure they were there for the ceremony. This alleviated the pressures for us to “choose” and since my fiancé is moving to my state after graduation it allows him to have a big and meaningful ceremony with his family even though I’m giving that up with mine, which I’m okay with. With this change, we wouldn’t add more than 5-6 people to the party that was already planned. After I suggested this, my FMIL has said they can’t just throw a wedding together in that time (even though they already have a party together and in my eyes doesn’t have to be anything fancy AT ALL - the original wedding was going to be in my parents 8 acre property) and this “isn’t what she imagined for (her) sons wedding.” Yes he’s the youngest but he’s not the first to be married and has another brother still to be married after us to his long-time gf...

"AITA for chiding a door-to-door salesperson who walked on our freshly paved driveway, despite a yellow tape barricade in the front of the driveway?. I live in a quiet neighborhood that doesn’t get a lot of solicitors; maybe three or four times a year.  I have a three year old and a pregnant wife and I was cooking dinner and we were chatting about our day, it was about 6:15pm and the door bell rang.

As a rule, at night we don’t answer the door for unwanted solicitors because we find the interactions uncomfortable.  I hear my wife say to my son “don’t answer the door, hide over here.” We have been teaching our 3 year old not to simply open the door for strangers or even walk in front of the window when a doorbell rings without a parent.

Couple this with the fact that today we spent $250 to repave the driveway because it was getting old and had some stains on it. There is a yellow tape barricade on the front of the driveway saying DO NOT CROSS” so as to not interfere with the drying asphalt.

That’s when I hear my wife say “oh [husband] she is walking on the driveway!” Turns out as she was exiting she just walked down the driveway as an exit as if she didn’t see the barricade.

I promptly opened the door, voiced raised so she could hear me but not screaming and said “excuse me, do you see that tape in the front of the driveway?”

She was a bit startled and said “I didn’t see it I’m sorry sir.” She seemed genuine, with a hint of trying to maintain professional composure.

And this is where I might’ve ventured into TA territory, I said “if you are going to solicit neighborhoods, you need to pay attention and be respectful to people’s property.”

That’s when she met my annoyed tone and said “I said i was sorry, you act like I did it on purpose or something!!” I was a bit shocked so I told her if she’s going to go house to house disrespecting homeowners I’m going to call the police.

She said loudly “go ahead then!”

I told her I will but I actually had no intention to. But then I peaked out the window and saw her crying, I think, and at first I started to feel guilty. But then I remembered that those solicitors often canvas as a group (3-5 young adults, at ages I’m guessing 18-22 years old) and I got a little worried that her group would see her upset and they would want to start trouble. (Side note I didn’t see her group, if she had one, and had no idea what she was selling, usually it’s magazines but I have no Idea).

So I did call the police. I told them the story just like I’ve told you and they sent a car to the neighborhood, I don’t know what came of it after that, probably nothing. I told the police on the dispatch line that I have no problem with her and I don’t want her to get in trouble necessarily I just don’t want any trouble and I thought the police should know in advance, in case.

"AITA for pretending not to recognize someone?. I was at the store with my fiance and I saw this kid I had gone to high school with. We weren't friends during school. Anyway, fiance and I had been out on a boat all day, we were hot and tired, hungry and trying to get something quick for dinner.

The kid from school spots me and comes over, asks me if I'm CarmelaCorleone, I say yes, he asks if I remember him, we were in school together. I told him I'm sorry but it's been a long time since high school and I didnt keep up with anyone and no, I dont recall him.

He started going on about the classes we took together and how i once let him copy a couple of my test answers, and how he dated this girl who knew one of my friends.

Now, both me and my guy dont really feel like having a long, reminisce so my fiance goes off to grab the frozen pizza and leaves me with HS Guy. I just wanted to get out of there and go home so u told him ""I'll go through the yearbook later and try to remember. Hope you ha e a good night."" Went and found fiance and we checked out, went home.

Just a little while ago I got a message from my old best friend from school, who i haven't spoken to in about four years, wanting to know why HS guy messaged her about me being rude to him. I told her I really just didnt remember him and I wasnt trying to be rude, just didnt remember."" Anyway, shes insisting I'm lying and was deliberately being an asshole.

Here's the thing, I really dont remember him all that well. We ran in different groups and they only overlapped briefly when he dated a girl I was sort of friends with but we weren't close friends. And I let plenty of people copy my tests in school because I was desperate for approval from my classmates.

This guy and I had about as minuscule a connection as possible, we never spoke outside of school nor after graduation. We dont even have mutual FB friends.

So, AIYA for not remembering some guy I went to high school with?

"AITA for using the word “asshole” in a conversation with a friend?. This friend of mine is in my view a bit precious about swearing or generally uncouth language in a way I find over the top for someone in their late 30’s. 

Anyway. He sent me an opinion article about someone doing and arguing for something which he well knows is a pet peeve of mine. (I won’t disclose the topic to keep it vague and ensure the responses aren’t coloured by it). I read the article and wrote back:

“Typical asshole [person who does that activity/is part of that group]. You seem to wonder why I have such antipathy toward them, doesn’t this article amply demonstrate it?”

He then replied telling me: 

“I do honestly wonder why you react like that. It’s quite unnatural to abuse someone like that and call someone such awful names. I know you see it as some sort of badge of honour but I consider it a really sad reflection on you. Why can’t you be civil?”

I replied “How am I not being civil, whom did I abuse or call awful names?”

And he responded with “Calling someone an asshole is civil is it? Is that truly what you’ve become?”

I said: “you’re really becoming precious if you think saying that someone is being an asshole is a heinous and awful insult. and by the way, this is something I said as a personal reaction to the attitude conveyed in his article, not as if I went up to him (or anyone else) in public and called them names.”

Him:  “ I am honestly shocked with the tone and content of your response. It’s just so base and unthoughtful. “

Me: “You take exception to one (fairly mild) term, and therefore dismiss my whole response as “base and unthoughful””

Him: “Exactly. The mature thing to do would be to argue your case and not respond with abuse.” 

Me: “and I did argue my case. Which is this is the exact selfish and entitled attitude that I loathe and that is sadly common.”

Him: “The second word you used was “asshole”. How does that help your argument.”

Me: “It’s a descriptive term which encapsulates the attitude and behaviour captured in the article. do you really take such strong exception to how everyone you interact with talks? Or is there some reason you’re singling me out? do you really contend nobody else you know would use the relatively mild insult of “asshole”?”

Him: “I know many people across a wide variety of stations in life and no one immediately reacts with such language from a relatively innocuous article. They just don’t.”

So, fellow assholes, has lurking in this sub desensitised me to the rudeness of the word “asshole” or is my friend grossly overreacting like I think? It’s not like I would use the term in a professional or formal context, but I don’t think it’s so grossly rude that it’s out of place in a casual conversation about another person’s behaviour or attitude.",NTA sounds likes your friend needs help removing th the stick from their arse.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for not wanting to invite my mom to my wedding?. Hi Reddit,

So let me start by saying that my fiancee and I are engaged, and have been since like mid-November. We're getting set up to have our wedding in July. We just sent out our save-the-dates a couple of weeks ago, and my mother did not make the list of people we've sent these to.

I've had a pretty rocky relationship with my mom for most of my life. When I was growing up I never really had a concept of what it was to be a good mother and what it meant to be selfish and a mother who seems to have dulled motherly instincts. The man I grew up with around was not my biological father, rather a step dad, and I had really only known him to be my dad as my biological parents separated when I was two years old. My step dad was not really a nice guy and often acted out with his anger; nothing too severe that I know of, but when I wouldn't do chores, or talked back, I would often find myself getting whipped with a belt. I also chew my fingernails, for as long as I remember, I still do today. Back then, my parents tried to take action and would buy this weird formula from the store that you could put on your nails that put a horrible taste in your mouth, obviously to deter you from chewing your nails further. My step dad realized this was ineffective to me, I still would bite them, and I still remember him pinning me to the ground and basically dumping the remnants of the bottle into my mouth (though it was somewhat of a struggle so some on my face as well). I'm not sure to what extent my mom knows of these events, but nonetheless, the two of them got divorced when I was 7 I think. Needless to say, it was a pretty scarring event.

I went to go live with my grandparents briefly who snowbird in Phoenix where we lived, while the dust settled and my parents sold the house and my mom got a new living situation set up. During this time my grandparents were going to take me on a road trip to go meet my real dad and my half-sister for the first time that I would remember; I used to live with them when my real parents were still married, but I don't have any memories from that age. I don't remember any event that took place that I wasn't allowed to go with them, but I still remember the hype for that trip vividly... it wasn't until I visited my grandparents over New Year's this year that I brought it up with my grandma, and I asked her why that trip never happened. She explained that it was because my mom simply didn't trust them to take me. She also pointed out that my mom was selfish and pointed out that the houses we lived in, my mom splurged on nice furniture -- a new living room set, a new master bedroom set, new dining room set, the whole shebang. My room was a bed, a thrift store particle board side table, and a Target TV stand in the closet.

Anyway, I ended up living with my mom and would occasionally spend time at my step-dad's apartment. I think for a time my step-dad and my mom would try to work things out until they couldn't. I just realized one day I hadn't seen him in a while, and I never saw him again.

Things were fine for a while, I had changed schools due to those events numerous times as my mom moved around trying to get settled. I was happy, we went on vacations and I had friends and was comfortable where we were.

My mother then started seeing this guy who quite clearly had bad habits. He would bring over some his friends (whom I remember being homeless, I'm not sure if this is true or not) when my mom wasn't home and drove a shitty old white van and had his hair slicked back and must've been Italian or something, he was a real greaseball. His name was Robert. I never liked him, he occasionally made an effort to get my involved with his handyman business he would try to start up and make jokes and stuff. But I hated him, he was so off-putting and strange.

A breaking point came one day when I was in our office playing Roblox (this was 2007, I was such a pioneer) while I was on the phone with my grandma. I had my own cell phone and was charging it while on the phone, and I heard Robert come home with one of his friends, so I closed and locked the door to the office and kept doing my thing. He then knocked on the door and tried to come in, asking from the other side if I had a phone charger. I said yeah but I was using it, and he then proceeded to try and actually break down the door after I said I wasn't giving it up. I heard banging and yelling and he just couldn't get in, and my grandma was still on the phone and caught on. She was in Idaho at the time and called the local police from where she was at and had a unit dispatched. They showed up and my mom came home early after my grandma contacted her as well. I opened the door once things calmed down and the police arrived and there was a flathead screwdriver sticking out of the door frame like he was trying to break it off and get into the room. He was arrested that night and spent the night in jail obviously for a domestic dispute. I remember another time my mom had me call the police too because he was acting out, presumably because he was high as a kite.

A couple of days later, I woke up early one morning to Robert telling me to pack some stuff up, I was going to live with my grandparents. It was before school time and I remember he brought me to my mom's place of employment to say goodbye (she worked nights as a nursing home). I had never been told I'd be leaving until that morning. It was an emotional temporary goodbye.

A month or so goes by, and I'm attending a new school, and I'm meeting my dad and half-sister for the first time I'd remember. Obviously this got my nerves going a bit. Details here don't matter as much, I just continued my life somewhere new. I didn't keep in touch with my mom for a while, I didn't call or anything as it was sooo touchy. Eventually she decided she would come up to Idaho and start a new life up here. She actually did, and got her a nice house for rent a couple doors down from my grandparents. I was super excited.

And then my mom decided she didn't want to live in Idaho, and moved back to Arizona, and I stayed there while she could set life up. I went back and lived with my grandparents again, and while there, she and Robert got married. That's what I lost touch with her for years, and never went back to live with her.

Life happened and I then lived with my dad and step-sister in Minnesota. I don't remember how but I got her address and wrote letters -- we did this for quite some time. In the letters she said her and Robert had gotten a divorce. I had let go of some of my extreme bitterness when I read this, and she brought up a point that still sticks with me - she said there's no handbook of how to be a good parent. She also explained that she thought it was in my best interest to live with my grandparents, which I couldn't argue. To this day, I can't tell if she was actually meaning what she said, or if she was just being selfish so she could get married to a piece of shit.

We stayed in sparse contact for a long time, and eventually I went down to visit her. She told me Robert had actually died of a heart attack, and I couldn't decide if it was due to drugs or karma, and I found out she was living with this woman, and while it was never explicitly said, I believe they were romantic. I didn't care really, while she was kinda weird she was nice, and I don't care what you're into, as long as you're happy. I had a good time with them and went back home.

She then separated from her and met this guy named Peter who is in his 80s (my mom is in her 50s) and it's definitely suspiciously like a gold-digger situation. He's nice, albeit weird and has some Puerto Rican values about him which just rub me the wrong way, but whatever. My mom seems truly happy for the first time I've seen her. I visited her once and had the opportunity to meet Peter before I got to know my now fiancee, so I knew what to expect when we went down there. Their house is horribly cluttered, which I believe is Peter's doing -- it's almost on the scale of hoarding. Entire rooms in their house full of boxes and paperwork and irrelevant garbage. I warned my fiancee of this before we visited.

The time we spent with them was a *disaster*. Our relationship was going through some heavy shit at the time and weighed on us the entire time. I failed to communicate with my mom we would be spending a couple nights in a hotel close by since I knew the state of their house and I wanted us to have some privacy, and my mom and her husband went batshit over this, getting offended and didn't understand why we'd want a hotel room when they have a room for us. This room had a tooon of boxes in it, pictures of Peter's ex-wife, all sorts of weird shit.

We then decided to spend most of the time exploring the state. My mom tried to insert herself into my vacation and just wouldn't take no for an answer, she wanted us to leave our rental car at her house the rest of vacation to go to destinations her and Peter wanted to visit (which I was annoyed about mostly because I paid a premium for a Mustang convertible rental -- imagine how much it costs to rent that to a 21 year old!) but we finally communicated to them we would just like to explore by ourselves. When it came to say goodbye, she was bitter we didn't spend more time with them and literally scolded me like a child that I don't call or text her enough -- bear in mind she doesn't make the effort to do these things either. It was an extremely awkward and unpleasant experience for me, let alone at the time for my fiancee. She also made abundantly clear she wanted to be invited to our wedding.

Well, now we're getting married, and I had nothing but sour feelings for my mother. My fiancee has told me she doesn't want me to regret not inviting her but I think the regret of inviting her would greatly outweigh the regret of not doing so. My family does not like her at all and I feel it would ruin their experience. I can see her scolding me for not spending time with her outside of the wedding. I hold her accountable for stunting my social skills by moving me around during my childhood so fucking much, I changed school so many times I can't even keep track of them all and it turns out being the new kid that often takes its toll. I am awkward and unrelatable and unsocial. I find the way she treated us during our stay unacceptable, her actions during my childhood, everything. I do not want her there.

TL;DR - My mom gave me a fucked up childhood of moving around and dating mildly abusive men and has a selfish personality and would make our wedding awkward as hell.

"AITA for being upset over being replaced with my best friend?. AITA for telling my best friend the truth? Ashlee is best friend, Susanna for her girlfriend. My Best friend of 15 years is Ashlee.We’ve never had an issue.

  This is her first relationship. Three years ago a girl named Susanna dated her for 3 hours then told that her parents wouldn’t be okay with it. Immediately after Susanna is posting on social media about her new girlfriend. Ashlee’s esteem took a dive. Between 2 years any text between them was negative. “gtfo I’m not scared of you” and things like that. Now they’re together again.

Ashlee has another best friend named C. Ashlee sent a text saying “I really want me and susanna to work out. She told me to stop talking to you. I’m agreeing to not talk to you. I hope you understand”. (WTF?). I was scared I was next.

Ashlee is stuck to Susanna’s hip, (sees her twice a day everyday, stays ever other night at her house) which is cool I’m happy for her. However...Ashlee just keeps injecting susanna into everything and anything we’re doing. Ashlee is basically saying “hey I know we’re going to dinner to talk about important things but I’m gonna bring Susanna”. I’m okay with hanging out with her but not 24/7.

This came to a boiling point when we asked her to come to a band meeting. Immediately “I’m bringing Susanna to the meeting”....I told her no. She went fucking psycho. Saying that I’m a shitty person, what I’m doing is shitty and that I’m trying to ruin her relationship. Now Ashlee is the drummer for band. Can’t keep tempo or anything. We’ve worked with her for two years to get her up to speed but she never practices. We had to tell her that we are temporarily replacing her to get the album out. That’s why. I didn’t want Susanna to be there cause I didn’t want to embarrass ashlee

we were suppose to meet talk about the band, then me/Ashlee go to lunch to talk through this. After the meeting... she says “I have to go to Susannas”This had been planned for 3 days. I asked her if we could at least talk first. Again repeated “I have to go to Susanna”. I’m hurt. 

She would rather go look at Susanna at work than talk through a big issue. It would’ve taken only 15 minutes. I cried all the way home. 

She didn’t even attempt at all. She just drove me home. This is what I’m not proud of. I told her everything I knew about Susanna, I think she deserved to know+it would bother me forever if I did not tell her

When Ashlee and Susanna we’re together Susanna told coworkers that Ashlee was annoying, extremely clingy, obsessive, she wasn’t her type and she doesn’t like her. I also said Susanna was using her as a rebound...because Susanna  just got dumped the same day they got together.

This was NOT a malicious attempt to hurt her, this was coming from a place of deep pain and hurt. So I have to ask, besides my comments on the rebound (I know that’s a dick move). Am I wrong to be this upset? Am I the asshole?",I’m not even gonna lie I can barely even understand the story with so many abbreviations. So I can’t give a proper judgement.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for wanting a different table?. Backstory: My family moved from Alaska to the lower 48. We sold our house for a huge loss and planned to rent until we could reestablish our savings and  financially swing the big move. My husbands family, however, was pressuring us to move sooner than later. So much so, that they offered to help us get set up. We moved, with basically what fit in the back of our SUV and they did help us get oriented. For that we were grateful. 

Around this time my SIL got a brand new dining set and showed up at our apartment with her old set. Again, we were grateful, but it wasn’t something we needed or asked for.  It wasn’t even something we were asked if we wanted. This was 6 months ago, and we have been making due with the table. However, this large round table, does not fit functionality in the dining area of the apartment. The chairs are tearing up the wall because it’s just too big for the space. 

Fast forward to today, I listed the table on FB marketplace for $100 or an equitable trade that would work for the space we have. If the table sold, the intention was to purchase a different table on the marketplace that would be better suited for the apartment. Well SIL saw the post and essentially lost her shit, and then had MIL texting me about how awful I am and how selling the table is terrible. She is apparently going to show up in the morning to repossess said table.

Here are my thoughts:
1. The table was gifted and is ours to do with as we wish. 
2. It’s not a family heirloom or really anything special it’s just a table.
3. We are not trying to turn a profit from the gift, only get another used item that will work more functionality in the space.

So reddit am I the asshole for wanting to sell or trade this table? Or should I have asked for permission?","Seriously? It had been 6 months and it was a hundred dollar table.

"WIBTA if I stopped hanging out with my sister because I can’t relate to her about anything anymore?. I used to be very close with my sister. Ever since my sister (25F) and I (21F) moved out of our parents house (separately) I have found less and less to talk to her about. 

She invited me over for a sleepover a year ago and it was the worst night. Her and her husband were bickering the entire night, and she kicked him out of every room we were in, which created an awkward atmosphere. Then she proceeded to talk about things like gardening, her new vegan diet, the children and cats she doesn’t have, and Marie Kondo, all while never letting me get a word in. (Just for reference, I enjoy things like video games, skateboarding, tattoos, music, etc.)

After this night I then realized how close my mother and sister had gotten, because these were the exact things my mother is interested in. My parents were pretty abusive in our childhood, and while I have tried to remove myself from their lives, my sister has embraced them now that she doesn’t live with them, which I have also found hard to talk to her about. 

They both have always judged my choices, talk about their own interests, and ignore mine, every single time we’re together to the point where it is exhausting. And having my abuser and sister to be best friends and act like I’m the odd one out just makes me not want to be around them at all. Even though my sister has technically done nothing wrong, I’m just finding it more and more difficult to even spend time with her, I end up either irritated or exhausted, just listening to her either bicker, complain about something I’ve done, or go on about things I have no interest in. 
It might have been fine if it was a reciprocal relationship, but no matter what I say, nothing changes, and she’s just lumping more and more with my parents. They even recently went on a trip to Europe together, without me. In numerous conversations, they both also like to hit me with “you never tell us anything,” to which I almost can’t respond at my baffledness.

"AITA For Wanting to Increase Rent On Family That's Been Living With Me Over A Year. UPDATE:

 Well these family members thought I was the asshole. I sat down, asked then what was going on with their house, they said they didn't know and immediately asked if I wanted them to move out. I said no. I didn't want them to move out, but it's been a long time and I was going to have to raise their rent to $1000 a month. The boyfriend sits up, chuckles and says I'm not paying $1000 for two bedrooms and she says we'll move out. I said I would never tell them they had to leave, but I thought it was fair because of the wear and tear on my house and it went from 3 people putting in wear and tear on the house to 11 people. She then said that she does all the cleaning up after my kids and the dog and she is the only one that cooks and that my kids never pick up after themselves. Soooo...the talk went badly. I told them to get out and agreed to let them pay a daily rate based on $1000 per month until they are able to move. I ended up crying and we ended up yelling and she called me a bitch. So I feel like shit and am really wondering am i the asshole? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

ORIGINAL:

I have two kids and a 5 bedroom house and a dog.

&#x200B;

My kids are older and self sufficient.  My family member that has 5 kids and a boyfriend and his one kid needed a place to live while their house was being built.  They said that they would be with me about 6 months at most.  My family member offered to pay $600 a month in rent.  I accepted thinking it would be short term.  The $600 pretty much covers the increase in the lights, water and gas bills.  They took over the other two bedrooms and one of the kids shares a room with my younger child.

&#x200B;

Its now been 13 months that they have been with us and their house is nowhere near being done.  They haven't updated me on the timeline, but driving past the development its going to be at least another 6 months before it may be finished and ready for move in.  The wear and tear on my house has been noticeable since they moved in.  Rather than the wear and tear from 3 people its getting the treatment from 11 people; doors slamming, gates opening and closing, washer and dryer use, bathroom steam paint damage/mold, carpet being dirtied, walls being touched and written on, etc.

&#x200B;

They buy their own groceries as do we, but everything gets placed in the same kitchen.  The same goes for household items like toilet paper and paper towels, etc.  So some things are shared.

&#x200B;

Money isn't an issue for them.  My family member makes more money than me from their job and her boyfriend also works so there is his income as well.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for wanting to raise their rent to $1000 per month to help cover damage and upkeep that I now have to address because the wear and tear on my home has come about faster with so many more people living there?  I haven't discussed this with them yet, but if I'm wrong then I will just keep things as they are.  I just really don't want to be the asshole.","NTA.  You agreed to $600/month for six months.

"AITA If I tell my friend I don’t want to be around her husband, instead of just working around it?. An old and dear friend (71F) got back in touch with me (54F). We haven’t seen each other in years and I was delighted to go visit at her house.   

Her husband is retired now so he hung out with us, and he is a complete and total asshole. I didn’t remember him like this from before, but he was working when we were hanging out. Within five minutes of me sharing about my life he’s telling me all about what I’m doing wrong with my teenage daughter and what I should do. He was dismissive and demeaning to my friend.  He hijacked every comment and went on weird racist and classist political rants. My friend and I could barely talk. It was very unpleasant and uncomfortable.

Eventually she abruptly said, “we are going out for ice cream,” and she and I left and had a nice visit at the ice cream shop.  I didn’t say anything about his behavior, but she said “yeah, he’s like that.” She hoped he was going to go upstairs and work instead of hanging with us.  They have their 50th wedding anniversary coming up, so she clearly has found a way to deal with him. 

I love my friend and would love to get together, but have no desire to see that guy again.  I could make excuses and work around it and not bring it up, such as having her to my house, suggest we go out, casually ask if he will be there and say how much we have to catch up on and it would be boring for him so can we go out, etc.

"AITA for telling the cab driver to back off and let me do it?. Today I took my sister(5) to her doc appointment and we used my sister’s wheelchair for the appointment. When her appointment was over and the cab showed up to pick us up, the cab company sent a car instead of a van for her wheelchair transport.

I got my sister in the car in her car seat and I went to help the cab driver to put the wheelchair in the car. I folded it and then her l told me he would put it in the car. He seemed to be struggling to get the wheelchair in the trunk so I tried to help and he raised his voice at me that he got it. I stepped back. Instead of trying to put the wheelchair in another way, he decided to use his body weight to put the chair in even though it wouldn’t fit. I screamed, maybe louder than I should have, to back off and just me do it. I took the wheelchair out and put it in the opposite way he did and it finally went it. It was a tight squeeze though but it went in.  He yelled at me that he could have done it and that I was a bitch for screaming at him. 

I was just scared that he was gonna irreparably damage the wheelchair the way he was trying to use his body weights to force it into the trunk.

I was watching the film and this scene came on. The passenger next to me (40sF) seemed very uncomfortable and asked me to turn it off. I declined.

"AITA for forcing my wife to eat something she said she didn’t want in public? (We do this all the time). Married 3.5 years, wife is the love of my life. Sometimes she’ll force me to try something I hate/ she likes, sometimes she’ll eat something that tastes like ass and it’s so gross to her she’ll force me to try it too and vice versa. 

We have a very jokey and loving relationship so neither of us particularly mind this and we both love food so it’s really just who we are. 

We were out with family + friends for my MILS 60th birthday and there were ceviche tacos served which I’ve never had before and thought they tasted exquisite. My wife was next t me and I told her to try some. She said eww, no it’s fish, but I scooped up some and the assorted garnishes and told her to open up. She started laughing and said ‘seriously, no I don’t want it!’ But I held it there and she rolled her eyes but smiled and ate it. 

Just to add context, I would NEVER ever press it if I knew from her body language she was on a solid no about something but we do this to each other all the time and I know she eats fish so it’s not like I was making her eat an ingredient she hates. 

She visibly liked it and said oh, give me some more. I made her up a little taco and placed it on her plate, by which point her best friend from childhood (don’t really know her prior to this) who was sat opposite said ‘I can’t believe you let him force you into that, it’s disgusting’. My wife explained its an established part of us, but her friend kept shaking her head and told me it was inappropriate for a social gathering.

"AITA for being someone back to my apartment while a friend is crashing on the couch.. I (30F) have a friend (30M) who has been crashing on my couch for the past 6 months. Usually when I hook up with people I go back to their place but last night it didn’t quite work out that way and we ended up at my place. 

I have a side door to my room, so easy in and out without the rest of the house knowing, but we were not as quiet as I was hoping to be and my room is right next to the living room. I’m pretty sure my friend heard us and I feel bad.

"AITA For going off at my friend about how I wasn't his ""egg"". I had no idea what an egg/egg hatching was but a friend of mine I haven't talked too in sometime and who had recently come out of the closet kept bringing up with me. He was constantly pressuring me into doing things with him and would get in my face about it.

and by in my face. He would put his face closer to mine, he would constantly get too close and once wrapped his arm around mine. He said I was his ""egg"" which I didn't understand what it meant at the time.

I constantly told him. I didn't flow that way, I didn't feel about him that way, and I don't like him that way. I try to be a very direct person, but he has been very persistant for the last month.

Well, last week was the end of it. He licked my cheek after I told him to back off and I just snapped at him. Completely screamed at him and told him to fuck off and that if he did it again I would punch him in the face.

All he said was ""You are in that stage, but once you hatch. You will understand how stupid you sound.""

This pissed me off. I didn't know what this whole egg thing was, but I found out from our mutual friend that in some trans communities ""egg hatching"" is when an ""egg"" refers to a person they believe is trans, but hasn't come out as trans yet and they start trying to coerce them into transitioning. (Called hatching/cracking eggs.) 

**READ EDIT AT BOTTOM FOR BETTER DEFINITION**

Needless to say I was livid. I freaked out at him. I told him not to contact me again. When I told our friend he was upset too. He has called me around 15 times now and I blocked his number. My discord messages are going fucking insane, and I just feel like an asshole for throwing a 3 year friendship out the window, but he just wouldn't listen. 

In our group of friends things have been sour because he has started talking to others about me, and some say I went too far and others said how I hurt him in such a difficult time in his life. I feel bad about it, but I just had to put my foot down.

Edit: in regards what Egg is

According to /u/7291 

>""It's just a trans person who doesn't realize they're trans. Usually you say it in reference to yourself. You can refer to others as eggs but there's no ""coercing"" involved usually not even telling that person. Just ""hmm.. X is totally giving me egg vibes"" or ""Y is totally an egg, we're taking bets of if they'll figure it out by next year"". The majority of the time it's more ""I can't believe when I was an egg I thought wishing since I was a kid that I had a penis was a thing all girls did"" or ""my egg cracked around January but I didn't really transition until October""

"AITA for being upset about my girlfriend's housing news?. Background: I've been with my girlfriend for a year and a half.  She's just finishing her bachelor's degree and staying grad school next fall. Our plan is for me to follow her to wherever she goes to study and live together in the new city, since I'm not that attached to my current job or city.  I've been applying to jobs in the city where she's studying since she got her acceptance letter, but I haven't gotten a job offer yet.

Today: she texts me and says she wants me to not be mad, but she already told a guy in the city she would move in with him. It's a guy who was looking for a roommate on Craigslist for a 1 bedroom apt. near the University.  He would sleep in the living room and she would have the bedroom. he's a student so he would leave in a year. Girlfriend would sign a 1-year lease.  I was kind of bothered when she told me that. I said I didn't think this was not good and asked why she only talked to me about this after she had already made the decision.

Where I'm coming from: I'm kind of today about the guy roommate thing, since I don't really know who this Craigslist guy is or anything.  And I'm kind of upset about the 1-year lease, since it means if I do want to go there to be with her we would have to live apart and it would also cost more.

Where she's coming from: she's an adult, and id this guy turns out to be shady she can always call the police. She will save money by sharing a 1-bedroom apartment with another person. And, if I cannot find a job in the city, it will be important for her to have a reasonably priced place to live without me.

I didn’t want to drink because 1) I couldn’t, I had to drive home and I’m on medication that I’m not supposed to mix with alcohol and 2) I avoid it due to my mental health. I told my friend I didn’t care if she drank since I would be driving. This guy kept calling me out and telling me I needed to drink to which I said no, I had to drive and I can’t drink on my meds. He kept pushing and pushing and telling me I HAD to drink, so I did because I was uncomfortable. He all but held me down and forced me to drink alcohol and I feel like he manipulated me into doing it (even though I chose to drink it so he would stop pestering me, because I didn’t want to drink).

"AITA for calling my bf(25)M irresponsible for not getting tested?. Hi, 

So some context here. My bf (25)M and I (21)F got together in the start of Jan and we have known and been together almost everyday from the end of October last year. I really do like him a lot but I’ve noticed he has irresponsible tendencies and have tried to talk to him about it but he gets easily offended so I try to tell him more subtly until I just end up being a complete bitch. In December, I’ve developed really severe cramping and my period hasn’t stopped for two months. The cramps became so unbearable I had to go to ER where they told me I have IBS (irritable bowl syndrome) and that I’ve been stressing a lot and need to take it easy.  Additionally I also found out I have chlamydia and I’m not sure when I got it because I get tested yearly but just didn’t have time at the end of the year last year. I make sure I always have very safe sex and I tell my partners if I have anything. So, instantly I’m like “oh shit” and i tell him right away and that he needs to get tested. I’m quite panicky because it seems sus as fuck that I got it and it was weirder knowing that I had him get tested in November and he came back clean or so he says. Maybe I had it all along and didn’t know? Or.. It’s currently snowing where we live and weather conditions got extremely bad and I have been persisting that he got get tested and take antibiotics right away because I felt so much better after being treated. He’s very nonchalant and says things such as “who cares” and “life moves on”. By the end of the week I’ve completely finished my antibiotics and I rebook another test and he still hasn’t done it and uses the weather as an excuse. So I do it for him.  He had kept saying the past week how he would do it on Saturday but he actually had all the time before our shit weather conditions to do so but he never did. However, his friend asked us to double date and he was excited and booked our FOOD RESERVATION almost instantaneously. He tells me has anxiety booking apps and uses some sort of analogy like “you know how when you’re in hs and you get anxious retaking tests” to which I ask “at what point are you going to let this keep controlling you? Is your health and well being, and safety like not important?”  Also, I called him out and asked if he even wanted to have sex with me at all because I haven’t seen him for a bit since I work everyday and I wanted to have sex right away. Now I’m questioning if he even likes me and is attracted to me.  In the end he said he didn’t want to fight, called me mean and hung up. It’s been a while and he decided to sleep instead of even trying to communicate with me. 


TL; DR : I went to ER for cramps, found out I had IBS and also chlamydia. My bf wouldn’t make an app over the phone or use an online website even to book an app to get tested but booked a food app right away for a double date instead. Which resulted in me calling him irresponsible and him retaliating saying the weather was bad and I’m mean. He’s now avoiding me instead of talking to me.


* Additional info : I’m not the perfect gf I will try my very best. I take care of him, clean for him, support him, help support him when he loses his video game tournaments and give him head almost whenever LOL because it’s something I enjoy doing for him. I really wanted to cuddle and have sex when I was done but am I really less worth than chinese food. I’m not gonna say I’m ugly. Humble brag here but i have a really nice body? Or so a lot of people like to tell me and my ass is pretty nice too. I send him lewds as well. And not too much of a reaction. I don’t expect change overnight but he says my attitude stinks whenever I call him out especially on racist jokes because who tf thinks “Chinese people eating cat jokes” are funny??? I sure as hell don’t. He does the bare minimum for me and expects mad praise and if I make a joke about that he gets upset too.","Wow. There is a lot to unpack here.

Your boyfriend likely cheated on you. Let's just get that out of the way.

Don't you wonder why HE didn't freak out thinking you cheated? It's because he knows it's him

It also sounds like he's staying with you because he's got it made.

He knows you have self worth issues, so he can do the bare minimum, and he still won't lose you. You give him blowies on command, you clean up after him, he doesn't have sex with you, he compromised your health, he doesn't support you and your needs...

"WIBTA for snitching on my department?. I work for a store and we have a ranking between stores of the same brand, regarding sales of specific products. 

Some of those products don't count towards stock, let's call them postcards. Other products that aren't on the competition also don't, let's call them envelopes.

Our manager told us to try to bill envelopes as postcards everytime it's possible. I don't do it, I find it wrong and I don't want to win a prize by cheating, but one of my collegues does it and kind of overdoes it.

"WIBTA if I didn't go to my dad's wedding?. This story only will make sense if I give some background to it so I'm sorry if it's a little lengthy. 

I'm 24(F) that comes from an abusive home life with my two other sisters 26 and 21 when we were growing up. My older sister, i'll call her Jane, is my half sister. Her biological dad didnt want to be a parent when she was born so my mom had full custody of her until she married my dad, who technically adopted Jane. My parents went through a nasty divorce and this had a significant impact on all of us. Fast forward to Jane's 18th birthday, my dad wrote her a letter basically saying that he couldn't be her dad anymore and that he was writing her off. It broke her heart, and really mine too for her. My little sister got into drugs and moved out of state with my dad shortly after this. She and Jane soon lost contact too. A few years later, Jane fell in love and got engaged to the love of her life. Seriously the coolest BIL I could ever ask for now. Jane, having little contact with my dad and little sister, sent both of them a wedding invite, and despite him being so horrible to her. She asked him to walk her down the aisle because he still meant a lot to her. I personally saw the wedding invite on his kitchen table before she and her now husband got married. Come wedding day, my dad, and my little sister don't show up. Jane was absolutely devastated. I had other family members offer to walk her down the aisle but she said no. She only wanted my dad to. 

Fast forward to April of this last year, my dad(60) let's me know that he's engaged to a 27 year old woman who is from an Island adjacent to Honduras, has a 5 year old daughter, and can hardly speak English. He asked me if I would come to his wedding and I said why would I go if he didn't go to his own Daughter's wedding? All he said that he didn't like how he was invited, that he wasn't personally handed a wedding invite. ARE YOU SERIOUS?? I was so mad and hurt for Jane again that I had to stop the conversation. 

Fast forward to today, I get a phone call from my dad saying that his wedding is in a month and that I need to save the date. I didn't want to talk about it so I ended our call early. I called Jane after and asked if she heard about it and if she talked to my dad and she said no. That was enough for me to really decide I couldn't go. I feel sad and hurt because after so many years my dad might change and want to be better, but no. He's my dad. I love him, but it doesn't feel good if I go to a wedding like that.

"AITA for stopping talking to a girl when she was depressed because it was making me depressed.. Bit of Backstory here, this random girl who I had never met before got given my snapchat by some people I had met on a drunken night out.

We spoke quite a lot for the next few weeks, up until the start of december. When I noticed a change of tone from her.

She started replying less, she seemed less chirpy, she was very cryptic about her past expereinces, and whilst i tried to help as much as I could, she would never get further than just telling me ""It doesn't matter, Its only me"" or ""I'm not worth your time."" and while I kept on trying because the way I am is to put the welfare of others before myself.

"AITA for calling out pseudoscience on a chronic illness support page?. I have endometriosis and interstitial cystitis. I am also studying to become a medical research scientist. My tolerance for pseudoscience as a whole is very low, but medical pseudoscience REALLY grinds my gears.

On the endo Facebook group, people are always posting about how they're in pain and wishing for relief etc. etc. As a whole, many of the members seem vulnerable and are so desperate to end their pain and suffering- which I can totally relate to.

There's been an increase in posts/comments by a few people who give 'medical' advice when people are explaining their concerns and issues. The comments are like 'you definitely have leaky gut/candida overgrowth/estrogen dominance. Tell your doctor you want to be tested for *insert disease that doesn't exist*'. Now I am open to being wrong but I've searched pubmed/scholar/scopus about estrogen dominance (for example), some of the largest databases for biomedical research, and they turn up exactly zero papers on the subject. 

The same people are spruiking natural therapies instead of medical ones. For example, encouraging people to get off hormonal birth control (even though this is like the first point of call treatment for endo) and using vitamins/natural supplements instead. 

I don't want to seem like a know it all on the page but it pisses me off thinking about the poor girls who are desperate for relief and they listen to these comments that are likely exactly the opposite of what their doctors suggest.

"AITA for not wanting to move out from a shared flat for 1-2 nights because my SO wants to invite her parents?. My SO wants to invite her parents to come over to our place - they live quite far away and she doesn’t have the possibility to visit them quite often due to our lives being busy.

We live in a one-big-room rented flat, that has an open kitchen joined to it - there are pretty much no walls, save for the bathroom. The problem is the fact, that since there is no separate bedroom, her mother is embarrassed of sleeping in the same room as me. 

The problem is that my SO wants me to ""move out"" and rent a room in a hotel for the time they are here.

I said that I have no problem with her mother being here, she is welcome to come and sleep here, but there is no way I am going to leave the flat we share (we split the costs of renting it 50/50) just because she is embarrassed of sleeping in the same room as we are. I also made it clear that if her parents wish so, I am also okay with renting a room FOR THEM, in a hotel that has a good standard and is nearby.

In my opinion, asking me to leave the place I consider my home, just as it is for my SO, because her mother has some sorts of a problem with me being here is just ridiculous.

"AITA for not eating a burger my father purchased?. *This is a first time post and I’m on mobile so there might be some formatting issues!

Here’s a bit of background information: My father (54M) had been working in the yard and dirt. He hadn’t washed his hands before this incident occurred. There’s also another piece of information that I find relevant, I (19F) don’t like when people touch my food. I’m obviously fine with fast food workers/chefs/etc. prepare my food but when friends/family offer to hand me some food with their hands I prefer to get them myself. I’m no sure why I do this, I just do.

So after my father did the yard work he offered to take our family out to a burger place. There was five of us in total and it was a pretty big order (5 fries, 5 burgers, 5 milkshakes) . My burger was two patties, no lettuce, no tomato. Everyone else had lettuce and tomato, but there was another burger with two patties. All five burgers were placed in a box. When we got home, it was kind of difficult to distinguish which was whose at first glance so we tried to work through who’s was what. My father then proceeded to take my burger and dig his fingers all throughout my burger. He put his fingers on the patty, in the sauce, and my bun. I then asked as a joke, “ let me see your hands/fingers” to see if they were dirty (they were). He then proceeded to flip me off so I asked him why he did that and then proceeded to get mad at me. He threw a tantrum and slammed his food in the trash , yelled profanities at my mom and I. He then told me that if I wanted a burger so bad I should go out and buy it myself. I don’t have a car and he knows this. Then he gathered his stuff and stormed out of the house.

"AITA for not wanting anything to do with my mom?. So before I start, it seems as if more grown up people are on this, but I'm only 15 and a guy, so please don't say ""oh your just being rebellious towards your mom"" I have my reasons why.

So this started actually when I was born, my mother (currently 35) never took me anywhere fun, I always had to stay with my grandmother (currently 59) (who I treat as a mom), never went on vacation except once when she wanted to see some boyfriend or something down in Florida (we went to Disney Land and I only was able to go on one ride, and I could ride half of the rides by then). About when I was about 11 my mother decided to leave my grandmother and take me and my sister (currently 9) to live in a town where she dated this one guy with a criminal record for something (I was never told WHAT he did) and I was told that I cannot be around him as he was dangerous. Super long story short, my grandmother was arrested after being falsely accused of spying, and my father got custody of me.       (I will provide info in comments when I get to them)

Time jump to one and a half years ago my mom decides to introduce my sister's dad back into her life after leaving before she was born. He was extremely mean to us, and his other daughter who they decided to fight for her custody... my sister's dad was always verbally and physically (his daughter came home with bruises on her legs and then blamed me)

Recently they threatened to put me in jail for ""hurting their daughter"" (not my sister) and even the father got his mom to threaten me with it... 

To be fair I'm not sure if I could handle some stuff they do and I hate them for what they did to me, my sister and my family and even when my mom once tried to turn her life around, my sister's father came into the picture and ruined it.


So AITA?","NTA. listen dude, I feel exactly what you do. My mom was an alcoholic who tore me down mentally and really fucked me up.

"AITA for being rude to my course rep?. A course rep is meant to represent us to the faculty, and go to them with complaints.

He's meant to be our rep for 3 years of uni, and we're at the end of year 1 now.

Rep has sent emails to the faculty on behalf of the entire class when we didn't ask him to or told him not to, about stuff that needed no intervention, but we didn't know he'd emailed the faculty about them until after he got the reply, at which point he'd share with the group chat. All of his emails say ""the whole class feels"" or ""I am speaking for the class"", when we, as a class, haven't asked him to do anything.

&#x200B;

His most recent email was a few days ago. The booklist for second year came out and the group chat was sharing links to where we could buy our textbooks for cheap.

I said that the most expensive textbook on the list was from Lecturer who had said he would be scanning and sharing the relevant pages so there was no need for us to buy our own copies.

Someone replied saying ""what if he doesn't send them out in enough time?""

I replied that there are 3 reference copies of this book in the university library and if everyone was this concerned then I could go to the library and scan the pages to share with the class in the group chat.

Today, Rep posted in the chat ""I emailed Lecturer about his expensive textbook and he said (exactly what I said he'd said)"" and included screenshots. This would have only been a mild annoyance, but then I saw the email.

Rep said ""We as a class feel that this textbook is too expensive, and want to know if any allowances will be made for those who can't afford copies. \[MY NAME\] suggested that we get a copy from the library and make copies to share amongst ourselves"". There's more to the email but these are the important parts. Not only did he say that as a class we all had an issue with the price but he mentioned me by name.

Then I saw Lecturer reply with something that said we were all getting ahead of ourselves, and specifically mentioned me when he said this. I messaged some friends in the class privately and they said that they couldn't believe Rep had mentioned me by name.

&#x200B;

Here's why I think IATA:

I messaged Rep privately saying ""what you put in the email is not even what I said, if you're going to grass me up to the lecturer at least use my exact words."" Then I said ""This isn't the first time you've acted on behalf of everyone so cut it the fuck out"".

Rep replied that he's sorry but his autism (I didn't know he had this) means that he sometimes struggles to know what he should and shouldn't say and that writing emails like this to the lecturers helps him feel in control of his studies and he was sorry he mentioned me specifically but he thought that was what I had meant and he now feels guilty.

I then got some messages from others in my class saying I didn't need to be so rude to Rep, I should just leave him be as it's not a big deal.

&#x200B;

AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: That wasn't my exact phrasing, and I was nicer about it, but that's the gist of what I said, and I've tried to bring this up previously but he's always said he doesn't want to talk about course rep stuff unless he's on the clock

EDIT 2: IDK how relevant this is but part of the reason it annoyed me is that the book Rep emailed Lecturer to complain about the price of is Lecturer's book, written by Lecturer.",NTA He shouldn't be stating 'the whole class' feel or 'so and so said' if they don't/didn't.

"WIBTA If I (22M) were to make a man (56m) down on his luck cover the repair cost of a hit and run?. This has gotten way less clear cut than I originally thought it would be!

When I got off of work last week I was very upset to discover my entire bumper had been scraped up with the paint missing and cracked. There was no note left on my car. I was so furious and ready to find who did it and press charges, thinking it was must've been a customer. (I work at one of those arcade/pizza/outside entertainment places)

After spending a couple hours going through security footage I was shocked to find out that it was actually a coworker, one of the maintenance men, and he had hit it with his personal vehicle! The video clearly shows my car shake after he backs out and hits it. My conflict comes from talking with my manager and finding out it has been a rough month for him, as he has had to have surgery to remove a cancerous tumor, then apparently he spent a night in jail after leaving the hospital still with some anesthesia left in his body and so now he has a DUI from that. These are circumstances that would weigh heavily on anybody let alone a blue-collar man who probably lives paycheck to paycheck. 

My original plan was to sit down with him in the office and and try to work out something that would not cripple him financially as my car is driving fine it's just a cosmetic issue and doesn't need to be fixed right away. BUT I just got back from the weekend and now apparently the owner has FIRED him for hitting my car and not telling anyone!

Now I have to decide if it's worth it to try to get an expensive paint job paid for. It would definitely take a chunk out of my paycheck, (I make 8.50 an hour :/ ) but I'm worried I might be sinking this guy even further into a financial pit on top of his hospital bills and court fees! These are the kind of circumstances people become homeless or financially crippled over and I really don't want to do that to anyone, like if I took the money he needed to continue paying for rent or food. On the other hand, as sad as it might sound this '09 Lacrosse was probably the nicest thing I own, having bought it just 4 months ago in perfect condition hardly used. It was a breath of fresh air after getting rid of my previous beater car, which was ALSO involved in a hit and run where I had to pay for damages.

Obviously I want my car repaired but would I be the asshole if I were to make him pay for it, either through small claims court or some other way, during what sounds like a very difficult time in his life? Help me out because this feels like such a difficult decision but I don't know if it should be","NTA.

"AITA For not wanting to go to my boyfriend's house?. Context: Last time I was at his place, the first thing his mom said to me was ""Hey! We haven't seen you in a long time! We were starting to think you were a bad girlfriend."" 


I told her why I was busy- my grandfather has ALS and him and my grandmother recently had a slip and fall incident, which my grandmother is now getting surgery for. My grandfather is unable to care for himself so I'm spending pretty much all of my free time caring for him and it's been really tolling on my family and I. 


My s/o didn't say anything to her about anything I was going through prior to this conversation. Basically, his mom would ask ""Hey, what's up with  your girlfriend? we haven't seen her in a while"" and he'd just not tell them anything, which gave them the impression that I was blowing him off. 

After this, him and I had a conversation about our relationship, he admitted to me that he vents to his mom about me and that she doesn't think that we should be together. She told him to break up with me. 

Today is his birthday and he wants me to come over, not for a party or celebration or anything, but just to hang out. If it were a birthday party, then I'd be willing to put it aside, I suppose. He said she's not going to be home, but, I'm not comfortable because I don't feel welcomed in her home.

She hangs in my yard all day and doesn't look great. She's thin, has fleas, and has scabs all over her and around her eyes. She goes to the bathroom in my yard and it doesn't look like normal cat poop. She definitely isn't healthy. 

I have a cat of my own who goes outside when I'm outside and is inside the rest of the time. When my cat is out, my neighbor's cat follows him around and they play.

"AITA for continuing relationship with my ex-stepdad?. edit: title should be \*continuing a relationship

My mom married my stepdad when I was 10. My bio dad was an abusive and OD’ed when I was little, so my sister and I took to our new stepdad really quickly and started calling him “Dad” etc really quickly. My mom didn’t stop us but she didn't actually encourage this behavior, in hindsight I actually think she either felt threatened or she didn’t want us to get overly attached.

When I was 16, he cheated on her and they got divorced. It was bad. There were issues on both sides as there almost always are in these kind of situations, but cheating is still a huge transgression regardless.

My mom was livid, and my sister and I were both pretty much angry at everyone.

My now ex-stepdad made it clear that he still cared us about my sister and I, but that it was on our terms and didn’t push us. My older sister moved out not long after and keeps our whole family at arms-length anyway, but after high school I started cautiously resuming a relationship with him. I didn't tell my mom but I think she sort of knew if that makes sense and just wanted to pretend like it wasn't happening.

Four years post-divorce, I can accept that someone can be a terrible partner but a good father. If he was my bio dad, I feel like it would be 100% acceptable for me to keep seeing him. But because he’s my stepdad, it feels like I’m betraying my mom. The other thing is that he’s richer than my mom and his extended family is generally more stable so it's like I’m trading up. And he’s married to the woman he cheated on my mom with. She and I are never going to be BFFs, she’s sort of on the periphery and my relationship with her has reached the point of cautious friendliness. And my sister has already half-abandoned my mom (and me) so it would be another blow. And my mom was a really good mom, despite her issues and the awful parenting she had herself. And also he was only really married to my mom for 4 years, which while it felt long at the time, isn't the same as him being in our lives for 10+ years.

I want to continue having a relationship with him. I want to have a dad. I'm in a serious relationship right now, and I can't help thinking about how nice it would be to have him walk me down the aisle and I know he would be honored, but that would be a huge slap in the face to my mom and how can I do that to her?

At this particular theater you buy your tickets and simultaneously select your seats via a map interface of the theater you'll be sitting in.

Okay, set-up over. After buying food, we walk to our theater. Our assigned seats are right behind the handicapped seating as you walk into the room. We see a couple in our seats and we look at them for a moment. We talk quietly to ourselves, ""I'm positive these are our seats...""

"AITA for feeling hurt that I was ditched at a concert?. My sister and I recently attended a John Mayer concert together.

A little backstory: we’re 5.5 years apart in age and at different places in our lives. She has a family and I don’t. We’ve never been those “best friend” sisters, but I still try to make it a point to get together once or twice a year. Concerts are usually enjoyable to go to so long as both parties want to see the artist, which we did.

So on the night of the concert, she gets a text from a friend that a mutual friend of theirs is also at the concert, and she makes a plan to meet up with her at intermission. Totally normal to say hi to people you know who are also there. Where the problem begins is when I tell her after 15 minutes of them chatting that the show would probably be starting up again soon. She made an “aww man!” face and said “why don’t I meet you back there in a little bit? I’ll bring you a drink!” I was taken aback but didn’t protest because I didn’t want to look like a jerk. We all walked toward the section our seats were in (we were upper deck, her friend was lower) and they talked for another 10 minutes (while I awkwardly scrolled on my phone because they were talking about work).

The lights dimmed and the show started back up so I walked down to our seats, only to turn around and realize she hadn’t come with. I texted her after 2 songs to see where she was. He played another 2 and I didn’t hear from her. All total she missed 7 songs, which was roughly 35 minutes. I finally got up and walked up to the concourse to find them still talking. I asked her if she was coming back and she snapped at me that she was having a conversation. I told her I was there to see the concert with HER, not by myself. She finally came back to her seat and didn’t acknowledge me until the encore. We made awkward small talk after the show ended, and we went home.

I texted her the following day and told her that my feelings were really hurt, and she replied that she wasn’t sorry for running into a friend and having a good talk, and that she’s “not required to enjoy a show on only your terms”.

I guess I assumed that if you’re seeing a concert with a person, you should be enjoying it with them.

Missing a song is one thing, but over half of the second set seems ridiculous.

Hey guys,

So me and my husband(both 28) lives in a different city unlike his sister (25) who lives 4 hours away. She comes visit from time to time and of course she is always welcomed. I dont have a problem with her staying at our place at all 100%. However there are things that bothers me sometimes. After months of thoughts and courage, I finally addressed this to my husband because they are quite close and she is his sister after all. But his responses surprised me. 

I feel like she is crossing the line and my husband thinks its totally fine. He says its a cultural difference but I think its not. So please honestly tell me if im over reacting. 

What are these instances? 
- Scenario 1: 
Husband and I are sleeping and our bedroom door is open. Bed is right beside the bedroom door and right in front of the door there is a huge mirror.  She uses blow dryer after her shower. Ofcourse this wakes me up. 
*My thoughts: i think its rude. She could at least close the door or use it inside the bathroom(there is a cord and a mirror there) 
* Husband: We are family so it doesn’t matter. 

-Scenario 2:  
Husband and I lying down in bed watching tv. Sister in law finds her way between us, lies down and later falls asleep. 
*My thoughts: i do not feel comfortable about this because the bed is not a king size and there was an empty bedroom waiting for her. Plus, we are newly weds. 
* Husband: We are family so it doesn’t matter. She thinks of you as a friend. 


-Scenario 3:
I was doing dishes in the kitchen, came back to our bedroom and find my sister-in-law moving our long couch beside the bed so she can have her legs comfortable to sleep with us in OUR BED. She had an empty room waiting for her. 
*My thoughts: If she is 5, maybe okay... but hey she is 25... it bugs me that she doesnt even ask if its okay to do it and it bugs me that my husband thinks nothings wrong with it
*Husband’s thoughts: She doesnt live with us and besides we are family so he thought it was normal. 


So these are a few examples and its driving me mad sometimes. I feel like she is so immature and my husband is immature to think nothing is wrong with it.. Am I wrong?","NTA. That's weird.

"AITA For getting angry at my friend for insulting my autistic roommate?. Throwaway account because my friends know my main.

I have a really close friend and roommate with autism (we’ll call her F) who hangs around our group of friends. Her autism isn’t severe enough to be noticeable right away but is bad enough for people to be able to tell after hanging around her a few hours. Let me clarify everyone in the group is aware of this and has never complained about her before this point. 

One of my friends (we’ll call her B) who is basically the ring leader of the whole group, will organise places to spend time together and such and will invite F to the social events without me prompting it (F is friends with all of them but she’s my roommate so closest to me and I’m the one who introduced her to the group). So I thought B enjoyed hanging out with F. B and I did have something going on, we had been on one date but hadn’t gone further than that or made anything offical. So I liked B as a person...until yesterday.

Turns out B had started texting her about how she was only annoying everyone by turning up and about how self centred she was for always switching the subject to herself and interrupting conversations. F was extremely upset when she read them. There was a lot more, since F had tried to apologise and explain she couldn’t help being like that and B had only taken that as her making excuses and gotten more angry.
I read the text messages and needless to say I was pissed. I called B and I will admit I lost my temper during the call and ended up calling her a bitch for “harassing” an autistic girl who wouldn’t know how to handle that situation in the first place.

B apologised to me but I told her to apologise to F and that both F and I wouldn’t be hanging out with them any longer. This really upset B, mostly because I wouldn’t be showing up anymore she probably didn’t care about F.

"AITA for not calling the cops on a homeless person?. It's more complicated that just that, but I wasn't sure how to word it. 

I'm an assitant manager at a small general store. We are located in a shopping center, and there's a senior center right next door. Yesterday I was working alone, and dashed outside for a smoke while no one was in the store. I went around the side of the building, and there was a homeless woman asleep in the corner. I let her be and minded my business.

A minute later a woman came out of the senior center and started complaining to me about the sleeping woman. She wanted me to call the police, and gave me a lecture about how they can't just sleep anywhere, it's illegal, and there are places for them to go. I was polite to the woman, and kind of non-commital. She went on her way and I went back inside. I did not call the police or bother the sleeping woman.

Some things to note: 1. the homeless woman was well away from any entrance or main walking path. She was not in the way. 2. Our general store policy is to leave them alone unless they are asking for money or harassing/scaring customers. Obviously she wasn't. 3. We do have a local homeless coalition, but they struggle because the city won't help them at all. It's very possible there wasn't anywhere safe for her to go. 

Idk, I'm actually not a huge fan of the sleeping woman. I suspect she shoplifts. But she wasn't doing any harm in this case. This town is rough for homeless people, and my store is in a good neighborhood. I understand why she chose that spot to sleep. It has shade and no one is likely to harm her there. On the other hand, it's part of my job to make sure customers/potential customers feel comfortable going into the store. I could tell my inaction was not well received, and I'm expecting to be notified of a complaint when I get back to work.","NTA.

"AITA for cutting off my friends for my girlfriend?. I have just finished my second year at university studying chemical engineering. It's one of the UK's best unis and I'm glad to be here, though its a huge amount of work. I established a friendship group when I got here, of both guys and girls who study a variety of subjects. 

At the start of the year one of the girls in my group, Chloe, informed me that one of her friends was interested in me. Her name is Hannah and she is a medical student, and top of her year. My lot met up with her and her girl friends in the park. I saw Hannah and thought she was gorgeous, but after talking to her properly I really didn't want to go out with her. She was shallow, snobby and up herself. She kept bragging about how her parents were in the property business and had paid for all her studying expenses, so she didn't have to work while studying or pay back a student loan. She also talked about how some ''stupid'' people in her class should be working in mcdonalds and also how ''ugly'' some of the girls in her class were. I told Chloe I was not interested in dating her friend and she got annoyed. A week later I was told I'd made Hannah cry when Chloe told her. 

In march I met a girl called Zara. She's lovely and is studying computer science while working in a coffee shop part time. Really pretty and smart, but also a really friendly and nice person and we've been dating since then. 

Unfortunately a lot of the girls and some of the guys in my friendship group are strongly convinced that Hannah is the right girl for me. She's pretty, smart, comes from a well off family and has a glittering career ahead of her. She's also a spoiled bully, who has caused problems for quite a few people at uni. My friends have met Zara and are convinced that it's just a ''fling'' and that I'll choose Hannah eventually. 

Zara and Hannah met on a night out, and Hannah was blatantly on drugs and started going on at me about how I picked a ''fat tramp'' over her. Me and Zara left soon after.  

After uni finished we all made plans to meet soon, but I was told ''you can't bring your girlfriend'' as Hannah was coming and ''it's not fair to her''. This was too much for me and I left the group chat. A fair few of them tried to call me but I ignored the calls. 

They were good friends, but frankly if they refuse to accept my relationship with a truly lovely person then I don't want them to be friends with me. Zara thinks I should reach out to them but I think it's pointless.

"AITA for ending 3 year friendship with someone who is tolerant of casual racism ?. I think context matters in this one quite a bit, so I'll start by explaining everything.

Me and this friend whom we shall call Maria, have been close friends for the past 2.5 years , more so this last year of university. Me and Maria used to hangout with the same group of people and share the same friendship group, the last year however,  I realized that they were not quite the crowd which I associate myself with and removed myself for the most part from being around them - unless Maria was insistent that I came sometimes-. One of the people in this friendship group, whom we shall name Oscar, is quite the trouble bringer .

Last year I lived with Oscar's now ex girlfriend, on one night at around 2 am Oscar came knocking on the door asking me to let him into the house - he was drunk- but insisted that his girlfriend knew he wad coming. At the time I thought nothing of it and just let him in after much knocking . I write to his girlfriend and tell her what had happened, she replies, baffled and says that shenever knew he was coming, but tells me that it was okay, not to worry about it.

The next day I find out that they had broken up weeks ago, so he was a drunken mess trying to talk to her. 

Ever since then and other occasions that I had also heard, I started to very much dislike this person, it turns out that he has since got a knew girlfriend and cheated countless times according to Maria.

I told Maria that I was disappointed that she could be friends with someone like him, she knew all that he had done including the cheating and racist remarks in first year,  but she chose to ignore these and claimed that just because I am not as tolerant of this stuff as she is, does not mean that she finds it okay .

A few days ago, I was hanging out with Maria and her friends, one of her friends made a joke and said that her pringles packet smelled like what 'Indian people would smell like', I was quite disturbed by this as one of my closest friends was Indian,  so I just got up and left .

Since then I had a talk to Maria and pointed out all these things that were bothering me between Oscar and the racist jokes that others would make. 

Maria responded by telling me that I am ultimately a bad friend for telling her that I would push myself away if she continued to tolerate this behaviour from her friends because it made me uncomfortable to be friends with someone who tolerates this.

We have now fallen out, and stopped being friends - she claims that I've twisted the truth to fit my narrative , and it really pains me that she thinks this, saying that I'm willing to throw away our entire friendship just because she is more 'tolerant'.

"AITA for bringing my best friend to a children's birthday party?. Sara has been my best friend for 10+ yrs. Our sons are best friends. They live far so when they come over, they stay the night/weekend.

Kay & I met through mutual friends 4 yrs ago. We hit it off & consider her a best friend too. She lives nearby so we spend lots of time together. I've become friends w/ a lot of her friend group & really like them

I introduced Kay & Sara 3 yrs ago. We hung out together a lot, even went on vacation together. Kay sometimes mentioned things that bothered her about Sara. Despite her complaints, we always had fun together so I brushed it off. Sara & Kay are very different; Sara is very ""girly,"" loves makeup/fashion, Kay is more of a laidback tomboy.

In July, Kay told me she didnt like Sara. Considering this comes YEARS since theyve met, I asked what happened? Kay insisted me nothing, she said they were different people who didnt ""vibe"" w/ each other & would prefer to hang out w/ me alone from then on. I asked if Kay would talk to Sara & she said “no, there’s nothing to tell, she didnt do anything”

This put me in an awkward position. I want them both around. I explained this to Kay; she said we dont have to have the same friends so I tried to let it go. When Kay & I would have girls nights w/ friends, if I said that I wanted to invite Sara, Kay would get upset.

Everything came to a head last weekend. My son had his first flag football game. Sara & her son go to all of his sports games, so they were over. The problem was that I had planned to go to Kay’s nephews bday party the same day (I agreed before the game schedule came out). Sara is friendly/has met everyone that would be there

I txted Stacy (bday boy’s mom) to ask if they could come & said if they couldnt, my son & I would come over a different day to give him his presents. Stacy’s responded “dont be silly, of course they can”

Not wanting to blindside Kay, I texted her while on the way to let her know. I knew that Kay wasnt going to be thrilled but I thought she'd be fine. It wasnt her party. I thought that she’d get over it but she was pissed. She said “how could you?” “I knew you'd pull some shit like this” I said since it made her uncomfortable, we'd drop off the gifts & leave

When we got to Stacy’s, Kay was speeding off. Kay had made a scene at the party & screamed at Stacy for letting Sara come so she was outside crying. It seems that no one except me knew that Kay had an issue w/Sara. I felt terrible this happened at a 5 y/o’s party. Stacy urged us to stay, saying “this isnt Kay’s party, you’re all invited here” but I didnt want to cause any more trouble. We gave the bday boy his gifts & left

Things transpired after that, Kay's sister txted me saying ""ur so lucky I wasnt there"" (?) I tried to explain to Kay that I didnt think it’d be an issue being around Sara for 1hr at a child’s party. Kay said “I don’t care whose party it is or for how long, I dont want to be around anyone I dont like"" & has basically ended our friendship

"AITA for calling my uncle's brother ""retarded""?. The story goes like this : Me and my mother were having a heated discussion in which she ended up calling a gay friend of mine a ""faggot"". After I politely told her not to address him like that, she went on rambling about how people should be addressed by their actions, for example if a woman is a slut, you call her a slut etc. etc. and that such adjectives aren't offensive if they hold true.

Her monologue went on and on for about 10 minutes, in which she didn't let me get a single word in. Needless to say my patience was running low.

So in an attempt to counter her argument with an example she would understand, I told her: ""Ok, so what if I were to call John retarded, would that not be offensive since it holds true?""

""John""(not his real name), is the brother of an uncle of mine. Unfortunately I do not know his condition, but pretty much he acts and thinks like a child (he is 40 yo) and he almost always repeats his sentences.

After these words left my mouth she immediately started to scream at me and call me disrespectful and that ""it isn't the same situation since he can't control it.""

I understand that the example I used was one of the most extreme ones, but I was acting on impulse since I couldn't just let my mom call my friend that. And no, despite the title, I have never called ""John"" retarded in front of his face nor behind his back and I am not planning on doing that ever.

"AITA for hiding my cancer from everyone?. In 2011 I noticed a lump on my neck. My best friend later also spotted it in the gym changing room and bugged me for over 3 years to go to a doctor. Long story short I had a surgery, it was identified as thyroid cancer, I then had thyroidectomy completion and ablation. The way my specialist put it was ""if you had to choose a type of cancer to have, it's thyroid cancer"", so you can put aside the standard cancer tropes (no chemo, nothing like the big symptoms and visual cues). The whole treatment went very quickly and smoothly over a period of 5 months.

I have lived in London from 2010, my mum and most of my friends live in Birmingham, so I was able to hide it very easily. 

Earlier this year I was house hunting, an offer got accepted for a house in London and I also found a new job. So pending completion of the purchase, I had about 3 months to burn. I went to live with mum at her suggestion.

The house purchase was completed in October and I moved back to London and started my new job soon after . Mum phoned me 3 weeks ago, some of my mail was still coming to hers (even though I had registered everything at my new address) - I asked her to go through it and send me pics of anything that was important. Of course, there was a letter from my specialist in there as well with an update on some bloods and scans I had.

Mum flipped her shit that I would hide something so huge and life altering, and that I showed her and the family no respect by keeping this to myself and even lying about where I was during the treatment phase. The way I see it is this is my own business, I can count on one hand the number of people that knows about this now (literally my best friend, my mum and my old manager who had to be in the loop cause I needed time off).

"AITA for not switching seats with someone on a plane?. I was flying home yesterday and bought an economy class seat on the aisle, right in the bulkhead behind first class as I like the extra legroom, being on the aisle, and being able to get off the plane first. After nearly the whole plane has boarded, a man who appeared to be in his late twenties or early to mid thirties comes up to me, and says he has the seat next to me but he has been separated from his wife, who is sitting a few rows back in a middle seat. He asks if I will switch with her so she can sit up in the first row with him. 

I politely tell him no, and he gives me a confused look, like he's insulted. He replies something to the effect of, ""Well, we were hoping to sit together on the flight and it would be really nice if you could just switch."" The other passengers are looking at me at this point -- I say flat out, ""I paid more for this seat because I like being in the first row and on the aisle and I do not want to switch."" He protests again and I make up something about having injured my leg and not wanting to move. 

Realizing he's not going to get my seat, he moves on. Eventually, someone comes and sits next to me (I presume whoever had the seat next to his wife's assigned seat). AITA for not switching so this guy could sit with his wife? 

I was under the impression that when asking to switch seats, it is common courtesy to give the person who moves the better seat (ie the guy next to his wife should be asked if he wants to move up, not asking me to move back).

"WIBTA for taking my new Switch away from my roommate?. About three weeks ago I dumped ~$500 on a new Nintendo Switch, with games and accessories. I’ve wanted one since it was announced, and finally managed to save up enough money to buy one. I bought it for myself, but I also got it to share with my roommates, who are good friends of mine.

I work a lot of odd hours, though, so I’m normally the last one in my house to come home at night. Every night when I come home, my one roommate is playing my Switch. I don’t have any way of measuring how much we’ve each been playing it, but he’s made at least 5x as much progress as I have on every game I own. I used to go find something else to do and wait patiently, because he’s my friend and I bought it to share. Now I want to play the Switch I bought, but I don’t know how to say, “Hey let me play my game,” without being a dick about it. So I sit pointedly on the couch waiting for him to stop playing. He doesn’t seem to get the hint. He plays all night (until at least 10pm), then goes to bed. A few times I’ve brought the Switch to work with me, then hung around afterwards. This seems to be the only way I can ensure that I’ll get to use it.

Now I want to tell him that I’d like to get something out of the game system I paid $500 for, but I’m getting frustrated with him and will struggle to say it kindly. If I do bring it up to him, I don’t know how well I’d be able to control my tone about it. Would I be the asshole if I was blunt about it?

I'm sitting in the kitchen and this friend of my daughter (12 F) who is spending the night starts talking about anal beads (I ask her to stop), then sexting and finally sex swings. Clearly she didn't stop.

My daughter (10 F) starts asking for more info about anal beads and I say no. Not right now at least.

I go tell my son (I'm fucking shell shocked at this point) and he tells me she (12 year old) went with them to see 'Good Boys' yesterday. Apparently her mom went too and explained these things to her. My son is friends with her older brother.

History: This girl taught my 9 year old (at the time) what (bad things are - mod removed previous post) is.

"WIBTA if I ceased contact with a friend (whose brother was diagnosed with cancer recently) even though he did nothing wrong?. My friend Walker(M34) and I(f24) known each other for 4/5yrs. He has asperger's. When we met he began developing a crush on me. At that time, I was in a relationship. One day he decided he wanted to come clean and tell me his feelings for me. I was still with my ex, so obviously I said no.  His brother is Drake, who he is very close to. We would all always hang out but as life changed, we drifted apart. 
Drake proposed to his long time gf and my ex and I also got married about a year later. 


When I got married, Walker stopped talking to me for a whole month.
Less than a year later, my ex and I broke up. l began dating V and when Walker found out he was upset. He admitted to me that he saw a glimmer of hope after my breakup with my ex and asked me for a chance. I said no again. Nothing ever happened with V. Drake had a child with his wife and 3 months later he was diagnosed with cancer. He had to go through a couple rounds of chemo, his family set up a GoFundMe but thing is, I'm broke at this time, I can't give my friends any money. I had two jobs, school and lots of expenses. Any free time I had, tbh I'm spending it on dates & getting laid because I'm going through my own issues. 


Walker would call me cuz he obviously needs consolation. But everytime I get close to Walker, it's always the same thing. He confesses his feelings for me, asks me to make sure it doesn't affect our friendship and then he promises me he's over me again. I wish I could be there for him but he gets emotional and I just honestly don't know how to deal with it w/o confusing him with my intentions. 
The last straw was when he asked me to hang out for my bday, offered to pay for dinner but I declined & told him I was gonna be busy bcuz it would've been 1on1. I went out with my friends that day & a few hours later he posts a story ranting about how people never make time for him even though he is sacrificing time and money and how people can be shitty friends etc.

 I was livid. I called him up and I called him out on his shit and told him I'm tired of always having to walk on eggshells just to please him and that he is a cockblock too because he insists on hanging out with me every time I get any time off, w/o regard that I might already have plans or a date. I was so mean to him that day. I asked him to stop contacting me cuz I'm busy with my life and that it's no good for him to keep on asking me to hang out 1on1 as the guise of two friends hanging out when he clearly never got over me. He agreed. He asked me to promise to check up on him every now and again, because he is very clearly depressed and is in need of all of his friends. I agreed too.

Of course we open the windows and all that. It has never really been an issue or anything for me, but the other day my friend asked if we could smoke with his parents again.

&#x200B;

I of course said it was no problem, so we go to the living room and fire up the xbox to play Mortal Kombat as we wait for them. After about 20-30 minutes, I grow a bit impatient and ask where they are. He goes to check on them and quickly comes back. He says that are in the bathroom getting notty. Notice I say notty and not naughty. Of course I think that he meant they were fooling around or something, and I say something to the effect of ""Ugh, gross, ive walked in on my parents fucking before, shit sucks.""

&#x200B;

He calmly tells me that getting notty is slang for smoking meth. I go pale. My parents were addicts for most of my life and I hate that shit with a fiery passion. I am both disgusted and furious at this point.

&#x200B;

They are smoking meth in their bathroom, with their autistic son in their room where their bathroom is. I had never known that they were on that shit. I asked my friend why he had never told me. He assures me it is no big deal as they are in the bathroom with a towel under the door. He tells me they rarely smoke it and that they can quit whenever they want. Yeah, i've never heard that one before.

&#x200B;

I tell him that it does not matter if a towel is under the door, that shit is pervasive. It will seep into every corner of the house and that shit can cause many health problems and even alter your genes. I tell him I am not comfortable here anymore and that I am going home.

&#x200B;

I have been sitting here since, contemplating whether or not to call CPS. On the one hand, I do not want that child to be anywhere near that situation. On the other, he is not my child, and considering his mental condition I do not think that he would have an easy time in foster care. I do not know if anyone would take him in, and I would hate hit if he ended up in a psych ward or a state hospital or something. I don't know what I should do, but I feel like I cannot just let this issue rest. I have been in an addict household and I know how hard it is. WIBTA if I call CPS?

"AITA for not inviting my coworker to stay in my hotel room?. On mobile so sorry for formatting. 

Two of my coworkers and I (all females) had to travel for training for work. The company made the hotel arrangements and obviously we each had our own room. One of my coworkers, let’s call her L, ended up having to travel earlier than us because even though she works in the same building, she’s part of a different division. They kind of fucked her by moving all her training around and she had to move her reservation to a different hotel to extend her stay. 

Well, her new hotel ended up being a dump and she swears it was a whore house. I then offered she come stay in my room, since it was a king bed and it was a suite, meaning there was a separate living room with a pull out sofa if she wanted more privacy. She said that if she could get her training switched around so she could leave the same day as us she would take me up on my offer. Cool. 

The next day when we met up at work I asked her if she was going to come have a sleep over with me that night. She said maybe, she just needed to check her email. She didn’t say anything for the rest of the day other than she’d be riding back with us. I still assumed she’d come over that night. 

At the end of the day, my other coworker and I were heading to the car. L asked us if we were going to dinner and we said not just yet since we were still pretty full. L said ok and went to her car and left. She didn’t say anything about coming over but she had my number and we’re pretty close so it shouldn’t have been an issue for her to text or call if she needed anything. I expected her to go to her hotel, pick up her stuff, and come over. For the rest of the night I kept waiting for her to call, but she didn’t. 

This morning when we met up, L accused us of blowing her off. That we didn’t want to eat dinner with her and that I hadn’t asked her to come sleep in my room. I thought the offer was pretty clear since I had already asked her twice the day before, and she had my number. If her room was that bad, she could have called at any second. I figured because she didn’t say anything, she didn’t really want to come. 

I feel bad because she’s sort of been getting shit on at work lately by management so the hotel was just one more thing, but I also feel like I did my due diligence by asking her twice to stay in my room the day before. I don’t think like i should have pushed the issue over and over and begged her to come over.

"AITA for wanting my sister to stop updating my estranged dad on my life?. This is something thats been going on for years and so much has happened so I will try to shorten it and sum up the main points.

Background info: Growing up, I was basically daddy’s girl, and had a fantastic relationship with my father. 4 years ago however, my 25f dad 54m cheated on and left my mom 54f for the ‘other woman’ 29f who we will call Abby. He did feel terrible about it, but did it anyway and married Abby a year later (worst wedding of my life). Unfortunately, I've had a lot of issues with Abby, and she generally didn’t approve of my dad having a relationship with his daughters. She would block us on his phone, go crazy when he tried to visit, and basically try to limit all contact with us (successfully, as we all live in different countries). One time my sister and him were coincidentally visiting a specific island at the same time, and she had to fight so hard for him just to see her and after 15 minutes he had to leave because his wife was so upset she had gotten piss drunk in their hotel room and was freaking out and causing a scene. Lovely woman. Now, this post isn’t actually about my dad’s wife, and to be honest I know I could have been more welcoming to her, but it was an extremely difficult time for me and at the time I really didn’t have an interest in creating a relationship with her as much as salvaging the one with my dad. My main issue was that I could literally feel my dad losing interest in his children, which was absolutely awful, and which I knew that she was actively encouraging. I finally told him that I would still like to have a relationship with him, but not with her. He basically said no, and cut me out of his life. We have now had no contact for the last 3 years.

Now: My sister still has a relationship with him, and I recently found out that she updates him on my life. This makes me extremely uncomfortable, as I feel like he lost his rights to information about me when he cut me out. I then asked her to stop doing so, and she flipped out. She thinks I’m being crazy unreasonable, and by asking her to stop telling him about me even if he asks I’m basically making her choose between us, which she finds super unfair. I don’t think that’s what I’m asking, I know she has a relationship with him and I don’t want to ruin it, I just want to be removed from it. I ended up telling her that if she won’t stop telling my dad about me, I’ll have to stop telling her about me, which really hurt her feelings. My mom is torn, and says she understands why I don’t want him to know anything about my life, but at the same time its not normal to just tell people you won't tell them about their family members. Which I get, but my response was that its also not normal for fathers to stop talking to their daughters for 3 years? So I feel like that argument is kinda bs. I don't know, I'm 100% biased here and cannot see her side, so I need other perspectives.

"AITA For Not Accepting Gifts?. My father and I have had a severely strained relationship which I don't wish to improve: I got the brunt of his abuse when he was abusing drugs, and I know he still smokes weed. One of the biggest things he did was ""apologized"" to ""me"" (both in quotes because he actually said it to my mother but not once uttered the words to me).

As a way to make amends with me roughly a year after his outburst, he decided to invite me to a concert to see his favorite band for my birthday. I repeatedly said I wasn't interested and he still got me a ticket. He also bought me several copies of their CD's (the band is Blackmore's Night). Honestly, my cousin made me burned copies of most of their CD's that I prefer to listen to. He bought me one of the seasons of Rick and Morty (Season 1, I think).

A few months ago, my mother mentioned me having a second guitar which was unusual, as I bought myself one and I haven't really played it. He left two guitars here for my sister to take to her apartment when he went down south for the winter.

Today, I was going to my sister's apartment for a cookout with him and my mother. As I was getting into his car (I don't drive), he tried handing me a tag and told me it was for my guitar. I told him I only had the one I bought. He said no, I had an acoustic. I kept repeating that I only had the one, and he said ""God, I don't know what I said to you, but I'm sorry,"" snottily, like it was my fault he didn't tell me he bought me a guitar.

Every single time he decides he wants to make our relationship better he buys me something, but won't listen to something that I'd actually use (I've told him that I'd love a case and stand for my guitar, if he got it I'd pay him back). Instead, he gets me something he wants me to have.

Here's where my dilemma is: I don't want a relationship with him as he can be quite horrible (I wrote a book, had an agent interested in it-they ultimately passed but gave me some helpful advice as it doesn't fit into what they usually sell, and when I decided to be the bigger person and reach out, he spent about a minute telling me that he couldn't bring himself to read what I'd given him-which he asked for-in case it sucked before spending the rest of the time telling me how I ought to call him once a week). But every time he buys me a gift, I'm treated like an asshole because I don't want it, it's nothing I can use and don't have space for.

I even told him tonight I don't have space for it, (after the several times he's asked me if I wanted anything from his former apartment as he's decided to move into a camper over the summer and live down south over the winter), he made me feel like shit for not wanting it.

So Reddit, am I the asshole for not accepting gifts I don't want in the first place? WIBTA if I told him to stop giving me gifts, or if he had to give me stuff, ask me first if I want/need it; if he doesn't I'll sell it if he won't take it back?",Take this to a relationship advice sub,0,0,0,0,1

"AITA for smoking in my car after my neighbor/landlord said not too?. Ok back story I live in a basement suite and the upstairs part is occupied by the people we pay rent to.
About 3 months ago the people who lived upstairs moved out and new people moved in. They rent the place as well as our space and they sub rent it to us.
I'm 18 and Marijuana is legal where I live. I used to smoke on the steps of my place (which is facing the backyard) the people before had no issue. These people move in and they start complaining about the smell and I have to go somewhere else. I have no issue with compromising with people but ever since they moved in they act like they own the house and we're just the pests that live downstairs in other words, they are extremely rude to me. I comply and now smoke in my dad's old work car and try to only smoke when there not home or at night.  what bothers me is She speaks in commands to me (ex. I was walking to the car a few weeks ago and she says  ""[my name.] Go to the car if your smoking"" while she was smoking a cigarette and that is what I was doing since we already agreed on it. I know it sounds little but it's extremely demeaning considering I've never spoken to this ""LandLord"" 
As I don't pay rent. I'm 18 and still in school.  


This brings me to the reason I'm writing this.
I'm walking the car to smoke and it's around 5pm,
I see a running car in the driveway so I get into the car and was looking at my phone, waiting for them to leave. About 30 seconds later The ""LandLord"" exits the car, goes to the passenger side of the car I'm in and without saying anything to me, begins aggressively trying to open the door (it was locked).
They come to the drivers side and try to open it as well. I Lock my side because I'm confused at what she's trying to do. She starts knocking on the window telling me to open the door. I ask why and they just repeated herself while trying to open the door. I open and ask what's wrong because they seemed very angry. They tell me to leave and go somewhere else because they don't want their mother in the car to see ""marijuana smoke"". There was nothing suggesting I was about to smoke. I say ok and then says she needs to have a talk with My father later today (he knows I smoke and is ok with it). I felt so disrespected that I packed a bowl (pipe) and took a hit anyway. I opened the door and exhaled the smoke into the air.

She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

My husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""We might not even have kids"" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.

So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""

MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.

MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.

After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""

So it's been months now of Joe reaching out to me telling me it's untenable, and me saying we can do remote, we can find places closer to you (he then says he doesn't want to spend the money), etc, and my cat begins to start acting out every time the dog is around. Peeing within eyesight, that sort of thing.

Cat eventually goes to the hospital, almost dead, from a urinary block. There's fuckery from the vets why it wasn't caught earlier, but let's just say he's okay now and I have a different vet. This, however, leads me to say that the dog can no longer come to. New vet has indicated stress must be minimal for basically forever, and that kitty doesn't process cortisol well so that means literally nothing. Joe can drop off his dog with our mutual friend and player before hand or he can play remotely or he can not play or he can let us find a location (but ~they won't let me bring my dog either~ is the new excuse).

Joe thinks I am just TRYING to make him quit; I tried to tell him that my cat's life just has to come first, and that I'm not trying to be mean. He's now talked to every player and they wonder if the dog can't come over, but I just don't feel it's out of the ordinary to say others pets can't come over.

"AITA for telling my mother I don't wanna meet her anymore?. English is my second language, and this is my first reddit post, so please keep that in mind.

When I was a baby my mother broke up with my father, gave him no justification for that, and went to live with my grandma, taking me with her. She then left me with my grandma to go live by herself and years later go work in another country. The only justification she's given me was that she was too busy with her job and didn't have time to raise me. So I ended up being raised by my grandma. She has also cut ties with my grandma, again for no discernible reason. She kept my legal custody (she says she didn't want my grandma to steal me away from her), making bureaucracies very hard for my grandma, and through that she received money from the government to help with my expenses but kept it for herself and never helped financially.

Other than visiting her sometimes while she lived here when I was little, a time when she lived with me and my grandma because a boyfriend of hers scammed her of all her money, and occasional visits to her where she lives now and vice-versa, I haven't had much contact with her. She rarely called me.

She came to my country to spend some time before christmas, leave, and then come back for new year's and her birthday (she tries to say that she can't give her part of the pension she owes my grandma now because she's tight on money) (only recently my grandma got my custody, she didn't do it sooner because she didn't want to fight with her daughter). And she asked me to meet her and spend time with her multiple times, and I went, mostly because she wanted to buy me some clothes and whatnot, tbh.

On her birthday, I said I'd meet her but had second thoughts. I don't like spending time with her, but I was afraid of feeling guilty, and most importantly, my grandma told me to go because if I didn't she'd spend her birthday alone, and I knew that if I didn't go, I wouldn't hear the end of it.

So I went but I decided to tell her the truth. That I met her because I was sorta forced to, that I didn't want to spend time with her, that it'd be better for the both of us if I just stopped pretending, that I used to meet with her in hopes that she'd be different, but since she isn't and I can't really force her to change, she can't also expect me to be excited to see her, and that if she wants to talk to me she can just call me like she has done until now, but that I don't wanna meet her anymore. The whole time she was like ""hmm, yeah, sure, I understand, no no really it's fine, it's good that you're being honest"" with that tone, and when she left me at the subway station to get home, she just jolted without saying bye.

If I could (I technically can, I'm 18) I'd just go no contact, but I don't wanna do that because of the same reasons why I met with her on her bday. People tell me to forgive her but she's said to me that she did nothing wrong and everything's fine.","NTA.

Me and my friends make plans for the night and its all set for when the night arrives.

"AITA cause I got angry at my little brother while he’s sick?. So a little pretext, my little brother and I share a room and sleep on bunk beds.  My other brother moved out, and my little brother was supposed to move in to my older brothers room. But because he’s sick (and it’s not contagious) he’s still sharing a room with me. Nothing serious for him, it’s just like a strain of the flu. Headaches, slight nausea, maybe vomits once every few days, messed up sleep schedule. Wakes up at 2pm and goes to bed at 4am

Now on to my anger. For the last couple of weeks my little brother has been sick. And most of the time when he asks me to get him something, like an orange or some water, I’ll get it for him, because treat others how you would want to be treated, right? So for the last few weeks, while I’m home, 90% of the time I grab whatever he asks for and gives it to him.

So tonight, it’s like 10:40pm and I just started trying to sleep. The bed was just how I liked it, blankets are warm, and I’m starting to doze off. He wakes me up, to go throw something out. I grumble and ask why he can’t do it, but still go and throw it out. Then get back into bed. Takes me til about 11:30 before I get comfortable enough to start dozing off again. Like a minute away from falling asleep. He wakes me up again to get him a bottle of water. I start getting a little angry, but get him the water. I quickly grab it and give it to him. And try to go back to bed. Now I’m tossing and turning, trying to go back to sleep, while he watches some Netflix show. No headphones, nothing. Just watching the show. It’s like 11:40 now. I ask him to put on headphones, cause I have to be up at 6am for to finish my homework for my ethics class. He starts complaining about it. Now in the past, he’s just watched Netflix of YouTube without headphones this late, so I gave him like 3 pairs of headphones. 3 pairs, so I could sleep in peace. He starts complaining about having to wear headphones, and it takes me like 5 minutes to get him to wear a pair. I try going back to sleep. Now he’s tossing and turning, and starts to complain because the headphones are uncomfortable, and tries to guilt trip me. It starts to work. This is the point where I get angry.

"AITA for asking my roommate to have her BF over less. hi,

My roommate has been dating someone who stays at our apartment about ~3-4 days a week(sometimes 2 weeks, if he is really busy) he typically gets here on a Thursday or Friday night, and stays until Monday morning, where he will leave at about 5:30 am. We are all in our early 20s - my roommate is still in college.


Because of his job(hes constantly traveling), he only sees my roommate during these times. And while he is a nice guy, our apartment walls are thin and I hear them chatting/laughing late at night(230am on weekends, about 1230am on weekdays), and when he gets up Monday morning he always wakes me up when he takes his morning shower(530am, I have to get up for work at 7am for reference) before he leaves for the airport. 


This has been a problem for me because my job's commute is brutal, 1.5h each way... so if I don't get good sleep, it is especially hard on me, and not being able to fall asleep until 1230 and being woken up at 530am has been putting me on edge.


I confronted my roommate last night, and tried to be as nice as I could about it, saying that I really do need to get my sleep on weekdays, so I can actually go to work and be functional. Long story short, she ended up in tears, saying that she already barely gets to see him and that I should just deal with it because it's not a big deal. 


I've suggested:


1. he leave for his flight Sunday night instead of Monday morning- she was not OK with this because it meant they get to spend less time together


2. get their own place - no because he isn't around enough to justify paying for their own apartment (keep in mind hes currently not paying for anything, his work pays for his travel, and anytime hes not traveling hes staying at our place).


3. stay at his parent's place about 1 hour away - no because he would then have to get up ""too early"" for his Monday morning flight, and would have to drop my roommate off in the process.


so im at a loss, she made me feel like a complete asshole for even suggesting anything. what do you guys think?

"AITA for stopping my roommate from unpacking at 2:00am?. Hi! I apologize in advance, this is a long one. I have always wondered if I was the asshole and she the NAH in the situation or if ESH.

A few years ago, I lived in a triple. Roommate 1 (the person I fought with) would go to sleep at 5am-6am, and wake up at 5pm-6pm. Roommate 2 (we got along great) would go to sleep at 7pm and wake up at 5am every day and I would usually go to sleep around 11pm to 12pm and get up at 7am.

Where we ran into problems was the Roommate 1 would be stay in the room during the night, and be loud (music, cleaning, eating) and this would wake me up. I asked if she could go into the living room, she said no. I brought it up like two-three times, but same response. As a result, by the end, the semester, I was really struggling with how little sleep I was getting. I’m an extremely light sleeper, and any noise/light does wake me up instantly - I did tell my roommates this but said ‘turn on the light and sing the opera I'm cool, I'm fine, just don’t be loud over a long period of time (like an hour).' By the end, I was falling asleep in class, my mood changed, the whole works. 

&#x200B;

So, I got petty in the beginning of the next semester. Essentially, the night before classes started, 1 was unpacking at around 2:00am. I knew she needed to be unpacked before 3pm the next day (long story). I knew it’d hard to pack in the dark and she really needed to get this done right then, but I told her to turn off the lights. After thirty minutes, she blew up at me, saying that I should've waited for her to stop packing. When we spoke in person, she said I was loud during the day too, and that she had the right to use the room as she wanted. I am not proud of this, but I got pretty pissed. I told her that I literally had two hours during the day where the room was not occupied with someone sleeping and that she was being both unfair and self-centered. She got up and left after that.

&#x200B;

I am 99% sure Roommate 1 had some mental health issues (including depression). I feel like 1) maybe I could have taken my own advice and spent more time in the living room, 2) been more understanding of her mental health issues and 3) been more open to the fact that yes, she does have the right to use the room how she pleases. However, there is another part of me is annoyed that she wasn't more understanding how I felt, and how limited my access to the room was, and how I tried to be really polite and she was very much like: nah, I'm good. I'll just stay in the room.

I don't know; her hours were annoying, but maybe I should have been more flexible. (By the way, Roommate 2 could sleep through anything, didn't care one bit about any of this). So, reddit, was I the asshole?

tl;dr: Roommate 1 sleeps all day, stays awake all night; wakes me up constantly, enough to affect my life. I get petty, and we fight about it.

Edit; I completely forgot about lil sis intentions until a few hours after naming my baby, I have texted sis to tell her if she doesn’t want her baby and mine to share the name I don’t mind her nicknaming my baby “Ro” “Roo” or “Harper” hopefully that’s a good compromise 


FINAL EDIT; We will rename our daughter to Roan Harper rather than Rowan Harper, the names are similar and I’m happy with that (still upset since you know, Rowan was my sister too, but my sisters feelings are hurt)

I’m left wondering AITA?","NTA

Well besides the fact that you gave us barely any information at all, I’m still going with based on the little info given. You just told us that you knew she wanted to honor her lost sister with the name, and you decided to use it without giving us any context at all

"AITA for no longer supporting a creator on Patreon?. For the past few months I've been one of the top supports for a particular animator on Patreon. It's not really financially responsible of me to donate as much as I did, but I really enjoyed their work and I was interested in the rewards, especially since they were exclusive to a limited number of people (five people, to be exact.)

Well after months of waiting rewards never happened. The animator even eventually stopped adding the names of their supports (something they did for even the lower amount supports, like $10 per video or something). At first I thought it was because they had a couple official sponsors (anytime in the past a video was sponsored they would only mention that company, but Patreon supports would not be charged for that video). But that's not the case because they are both being sponsored AND using the Patreon funds. I've been charged for all of their recent videos.

I know the point of supporting someone is to help them, not so I can be rewarded. But it was what made me decide to donate, because I don't exactly have a lot of money to just give away. 

Am I an asshole if I stop supporting them? Being one of the top tier supporters, they'll most certainly notice if I were to cancel (especially since there's only one other person in that tier).","Have you tried contacting them about your problems?

"AITA for bailing on a camping trip?. I came out of a year long relationship about 6 months ago, I was pretty torn up for a little while but I soon got over it.  Looking back, there where a few red flags and it’s probably for the best that are not together anymore. We still remained good friends, although I did stop speaking to her as much once I found out she met someone else.

Since then, I’ve been doing really well for my self, cut down drinking, moved out of my parents house and started working out. I’ve not felt this good about myself in general for a long time.

Cut to this week, me and a good group of friends plan on going on a trip to an island in a couple of camper vans for the weekend. 

Now my ex is also good friends with my circle, she caught wind of the idea and decided to join in on the fun with her and her new boyfriend.

In my mind, I’m sure I don’t have any real feelings left for her. But as soon as I heard that her and her new feller would be joining us I was over come with a horrible feeling, like a led blanket of shit. It was as though all my progress to bettering my self was torn away from me and I was back to my old anxious, depressed and angry self. 

I immediately made it clear to the group how felt. I didn’t want to spend my weekend feeling this way and probably bringing everyone else down.

Some of my friends have told they won’t come if I’m not going, and my ex has called me to tell me I’m over reacting and that we should all just get along. It’s caused a bit of a divide.

AITA for bailing?",NTA absolutely don't spend unnecessary time with people you don't like! Let the hell alone that you have crappy history with.

I can barely walk around without getting weird looks. Today I found out my girlfriend had been part of it. I called her a bitch, without meaning it, and now a lot of people are blowing up my phone with hateful texts. I think I might've over reacted...

"AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend's mom tour our apartment without me?. My boyfriend (23) and I (21) have recently been approved for an apartment. The landlord is currently writing up the lease for us to sign. Outside of renting apartments during college, this is our first time moving out and living on our own, more specifically on our own expense.

To sum it up, his mother is not happy. She is extremely controlling and pessimistic about pretty much everything if it doesn't fit her high standards. With her, everything is about image and status. But, with that being said, our apartment is actually decently nice and perfect for first time renters. There is no reason for her to degrade it. We are both over the moon and excited as all hell.

During her tantrum over the apartment, she asked my boyfriend if she would be able to see it with him. Without me. The only reason she wants to do that is so she can say whatever she wants about it, negative of course, without me there; In addition to probably try and talk him out of it. Personally, I am NOT okay with that.

I have spent the past 21 years living under roof of a family who did not make my house feel like a home. Me moving out was, and is, the best thing I can do for myself. The entire environment is toxic and horrible for my mental health. I could sit here for days telling you why.

Anyways, this apartment means a lot to me and I'm so excited to have the freedom it will give me. The last thing I want is someone to walk around it complaining and ""poo pooing"" everything they see. I feel that's extremely disrespectful. I wouldn't walk around your home telling you everything I don't like about it? So, when my boyfriend asked me if it was okay for him to see it alone with her, I said no.

This is about respect, and about ultimately putting my foot down and making a line that his mother needs to learn not to cross. I understand my boyfriend is the one who needs to be doing this, and he does, but after so many years he sometimes is no longer able to recognize what is normal mom behavior and what isn't. He is aware she invades everything and tries to control everything my boyfriend does, but of course, it's his mom, which makes it 10x harder.

But anyways, his argument here is that this is his first apartment and she just wants to be apart of it. He says that in the long run if we do not at least slightly include her it will take a toll on her mental health given how neurotic she can be. Ultimately, I agreed on a compromise. She can come see the apartment with US when we go to sign the lease. I refuse to let her go alone. This is my home and I won't be told I can't be there.

Of course, she hates the idea and has shit talked about me to my boyfriend about her wish not being granted.

So, AITA? Should I just let him take her without me? Should I not let her go at all? Is my compromise fair?

I feel like seeing your child's first apartment is totally normal, however, going with the intent to shit all over it is not, and that changes the circumstances.","NTA

Your home, your privacy, your rules. The apartment is yours just as much as it is your boyfriend’s, not his mother’s.

"WIBTA if I told my brother I'm considering rehoming his dog?. So I know the beginning sounds like I'm awful, but I honestly don't believe he's equipped to take care of this dog and keep him safe and happy. My brother is 23, I'm 19, and he has a dog that he just.. doesn't take care of. He has a 14 year old  chihuahua, and I feel bad for it. 

We live in the same house, but the dog is starting to get a lot of joint pain and often needs help off of chairs and beds if they're higher up. The dog will just stand there and bark until he's lifted off if he needs to go outside or eat. My brother just leaves him on chairs and beds, and will ignore him if he starts barking  to be let out. Like, he'll be about 5 feet away from a barking dog that's wanting to go eat or pee and just be sitting on his phone. Sometimes, I'll wake up at 1 in the morning because the dog wants to go outside and is crying, and when I go to get him my brother is just right beside him and ignoring him. If you're thinking he's ignoring to teach the dog to stop, the dog won't. We've all tried waiting it out and the dog will bark for /hours/ if it needs to.

He also overfeeds the dog, and lets the dog have all the people food it wants. He'll let it eat bread, pasta, meat, etc until it vomits, and then be annoyed that it vomited - when that could've been avoided by not feeding him excess amounts of food. When I see him do this, I tell him not to and that it makes the dog sick and he'll just keep doing it. 

I understand that he loves the dog, and I love the dog too - its just that it seems like he doesn't actually care about its health or anything. The dog also strongly dislikes me - so whenever I go to lift him up and let him outside he growls and bites me. I feel like its not unreasonable for a 23 year old man to understand that he needs to take care of his dog, and if he can't it should go be with someone who can.

tl;dr - my older brother doesn't attend to his dog when it cries and overfeeds it to the point of it vomiting on a daily basis. would I be the asshole for threatening to find it a new home?","NTA

"AITA for getting my friend's account on which she spent a lot of money permanently banned?. So I play League of Legends like many others and over there people make a huge deal about what rank they are due to either some kind of social status and in-game rewards that get better the higher rank you are. This obviously leads to a huge problem with boosting, which is paying higher ranked players to play on your account so it gets a higher rating and you get better rewards. This is a problem because now the bad players back on their own accounts have to play with players much better than them and they end up performing badly essentially ruining the game of whichever team they run into.


Now for the moral dilemma. Yesterday I messaged a friend of mine and got a reply with a message similar to something that goes like this: ""haha you cancer autistic diamond 3 (a rank) random"" This being very out of the blue and not like the friend at all I noticed someone else was playing on her account. He got extremely agressive towards me and berating me for my rank for no obvious reason (a common problem in League's ranked environment). He then started bragging about how he is boosting that account, so now it was obvious it wasn't the same person on the account of which I only know the owner. Fast forward 20 minutes of the booster repeatedly calling me a ""cancer autist nigger"" and I took screenshots of the chat and blocked the account.

Being so toxic, account sharing and boosting are all extremely bannable offenses so friend or not, I did not want het to ruin other people's ranked games and decided to send a report ticket to the company of the game with screenshots of the insults and admitted boosting/account sharing. This morning my friend sent me annoyed messages her account she spent a lot of money on got permanently banned and said she would never report a friend. I asked a colleague what he thought and he told me that i was TA for snitching, being 2 against 1 I started questioning if reporting the offenses was justifiable at all. So reddit, AITA?

Edit: Most replies so far are about friendships and whatnot. Just to clarify, me and her were not good or close friends so I don't value the friendship extremely highly, we just talked from time to time and played a game together maybe once a week/month.","NTA.

"WIBTA for telling my mum to stop giving out her number?. I'm on my phone, so sorry for formatting issues. Throwaway account.

To give some context to the title, my parents split up a year ago and my mum was devastated, without getting too far into it, she's been struggling to handle it. She has however, thankfully, got a lot of people around her to support her. She goes out multiple times a week, and a few months ago agreed with a friend they'd try to meet up every weekend, they often go out when they meet up too. 

Since she's started going out more, she began telling me about men she got chatting to. At first I was just happy to hear her talk about something other than my dad, I liked the idea that she may be starting to get over it and be open to the idea of a new relationship, but then it escalated. 

It became at least a weekly thing that a new guy had approached her, flirted with her, and she'd then inform me she'd been talking to them over text. The thing that gets me though, is her talking to me about these men has now turned into constant complaining about the inappropriate things they say to her, or how they want to date and she isn't ready to date. Often she'll say they said inappropriate things whilst they were out, and then as you'd expect, they'll behave the same way when texting her. She tells me way too much information about what these guys said, and I've already nipped that in the bud because nobody wants to hear about the intimate details of what these men want to do to your mum in the bedroom, she still tries to tell me often but I shut it down straight away. 

But my main point is that I'm getting to the point where I'm fed up of listening to her tell me about all these men trying to get with her, and the sexy talk they try to engage her in, when she's giving out her number to people already doing this stuff in person - What does she expect? She always has an excuse when someone asks her why she gave them her number (because she doesn't just tell me this stuff), and it's always playing off like she had a totally innocent reason to do it, like she wanted them to tell her about fun things happening in the area (as opposed to just googling it?) 

I've heard her friends say she's leading men on just to stop talking to them in a few days and she denies it and says she isn't interested in them and she isn't ready to date yet, but I believe she probably is leading them on. I've been out with her before, one on one and with her friends, and whilst she has sometimes been approached by interested men, this is happening all the time now, and giving out her number when she knows they're interested I feel is definitely making them think they have a chance. I feel she must be doing something whilst she's out with her friends to be getting all of these men talking to her, and I feel a bit bad for the guys who seem actually nice, who want to go out on dates, because they think she's interested too.

The thing is, if I tell her she should stop giving out her number, I don't know if that makes me an A-hole because I'm inserting myself into a situation she seems, ultimately, okay with. Nobody has explicitly said to her ""Well, what do you expect? If you don't want these guys to try to sleep with you then stop giving them your number when they've clearly shown signs of wanting to sleep with you."" But I feel it's because everyone feels she's enjoying the attention from the men. She definitely uses it as a confidence boost, she'll start saying stuff about look at what my dad's missing and she can get guys still. It's helped her stop obsessing over my dad so much, which is why initially none of us thought anything of it and liked she was coping better. I don't think anyone wants to stop her having fun, but at the same time, none of us want to hear about the vulgar things people say to her, or how she's been asked out and how crazy that is as she isn't even interested, every time we meet up. I really don't know if this is something I should let her navigate herself, or if it's a good idea I say something to her.

Should I tell her to stop giving her number out? Should I just leave her to it? Is there a better way to handle it?",You would be. Just tell her that you are uncomfortable with what she tells you about them. It is her life so she can talk to whomever she likes,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for refusing go on my dads fiances hen/bachelorette party?. Alright so, my mum and dad divorced when I was around 8 or 9. My dad was a bit of a Peter Pan and it was his last affair that was the final straw. I've always loved my dad but he never had a relationship with me and my siblings that would equate to more than a ""cool uncle"" - never putting his children before his friends (This is important later).My mum remarried the most amazing man and he has been my ""ride or die"" dad ever since.

My dad met a woman a few years ago (We'll call her Pam) and I don't know what happened but he settled down. Got a good job again, a house that we can visit and isn't a ""party house"". Pam has been good for him and he is back in our lives now more than he ever was (visits every couple weeks, texts and phone calls). They're due to get married next year.

Pam decided to go to Spain for her hen party and I agreed to go, there was only a few of us going in the end cause it didn't suit a lot of people. I can’t really afford to go to Spain but we were able to pay in installments and my mum gave me some money for the deposit. Pam put the booking on her credit card and lets us know when we owe her money.

Early on in the planning stages (after deposits were paid) one of the girls said she couldn't go. Pam said she would try and get someone else in her place, but that was the end of the discussions. Its not a very lively group chat (I don't know anyone else going apart from my auntie).

FF 4 months and Pam introduces someone new to the group chat. Let’s call her Sarah. Sarah is a friend of my dad and Pams, & has never liked me, for some reason. She’s around my age. At my dad’s birthday party she tried to start an argument with me, saying that I had insulted her,when I tried to ask her what happened, she just said something like ""oh you know"" & she wouldn't take it any further because ""she respects my dad too much."". Some background about me- I've never been in a fight in my life, not even a drunken one. I did not say anything about Sarah.

Sarah went on to send me an abusive Facebook message before blocking me on social media. I explained this to Pam when it happened, and it really threw me off for about a week. (I live and am medicated for anxiety).

I told Pam under no circumstances would I be going on a hen party where Sarah is going to be in attendance. Pam waited a few months before telling me, hoping that I would just get on with it and still go. So i feel cheated in many ways, out of money and out of the truth. I don't want to put myself in a close knit circle with someone who so clearly has an agenda against me.

Pam has said if i don't go i'll really hurt her, and I should look at the bigger picture. She also said Sarah paid everything in full so she cant ask her not to go. She After that, i borrowed the money and paid for my place (so she wouldnt be out of pocket) but reiterated I wont be going.

"AITA for keeping a dog for two days?. Sunday at 6pm my girlfriend and I saw a dog running around our apartment complex. We tried to coax it over to check it's tags; he had none. He seemed friendly enough, so we took him inside (he followed us right in, it took no effort) and put our two cats in a separate room.

Our apartment complex, the nearby animal shelters, vets, and animal control office were all closed at this point. We figured he could stay the night, so we picked up some 
 food, a leash, and some dog shampoo (he smelled awful). After a quick bath and some food, we took him to the emergency animal clinic to get his microchip scanned. He didn't have a chip either.

We noticed some wheezing and redness in his eyes when we found him, so we decided to pay for a quick checkup. He had a mild upper respiratory infection so the doc prescribed some meds. The visit was $100, being an emergency clinic.

We took the dog home and called animal control and the apartment complex first thing on Monday morning. The apartment complex offered to call the shelters for us and get back to us if they heard anything. Tuesday afternoon (today), they called back and said they may have found the owner.

The owner texted me, we confirmed the dog belonged to them, and I returned it as soon as I got home from work.

About an hour later, I got a massive text that essentially accused me of stealing the dog. The owner asked why we spent so much time and money caring for her dog for two days, why the vet sheet said we came at 9 when he went missing at 8 (again, we found the dog hours before) and dictated to us that, should we ever come into this situation again, we should take the dog straight to the shelter. The whole text was very rude and accusatory, and completely unprovoked. I did not respond.

Now for some relevant info:
1. This dog was a puppy. It was not housebroken or neutered, had immense separation anxiety, and was a big bucket of energy. It was an incredible amount of work to take care of.
2. I wouldn't have done anything to make the dog or myself uncomfortable. He was very sweet and happy the whole time. I have had dogs and love animals so I felt I was doing the right thing.
3. I have found and returned a dog from this same apartment before. They have several dogs, all of them are rowdy and apparently escape. None are neutered or have microchips OR collars because of the owners ""personal reasons"" (she offered up this info, I just wanted to confirm that her dog was not chipped to make sure it was hers).
4. Had we not found the owners, we would have probably kept the dog. That said, I feel like I did everything within my power to take care of and return the animal.

The owner seems pissed, and I'm pissed at the accusation. But... am I the asshole?

Edit: thanks for the replies, everyone! I'm feeling a lot better about how my girlfriend and I handled the situation. As we were talking about it, I was starting to think we should have brought him directly to the shelter the next day, but if the dog had been chipped we wouldn't have even had him for the night, much less two days and I do feel like he was more comfortable since we were able to take him for walks and release some of that puppy energy in a comfortable environment. I did find out that our municipality requires all pets be chipped and registered, so I'm going to be calling the apartment complex with my concerns.","NTA, the owner is irresponsible and shouldn’t have pets.

"AITA for bringing this up last night?. AITA Okay, so I am in a poly relationship. Initially it was me and my girlfriend, and we added a 3rd a handful of months back (a friend of my girlfriends whom she had feelings for)
(This is relevant) often times when they had alone time in their room (like if I would go take a shower or if they were just in there alone) they would lock the door (for privacy) and do stuff while they had a chance.
As time went on my girlfriend and I talked about her feeling more like a lesbian and not being as interested in a sexual relationship with me. She did say that I could look for a sexual partner though. When we discussed this, it was very calm and nothing bad came of it.

Well last night we went to an adult store and got them something for their sex life (which is okay) (about a month has passed, I have not done anything sexual with another person because I wanted to double check she was okay with it, but o have talked to someone who was all for it) we were all spending time together and they were going to go to bed and I was going to leave and as I was leaving they locked the door behind me. It occurred to me that they might try out their new toy tonight, and I figured I might as well ask before I go about the 'other sexual partner' concept,
And all hell raised and they are now saying I am incinsiderate because it makes them feel like they are not enough for me (keep in mind I dont jave a sexual relationship with the 3rd at all, and the sexual relationship with my girlfriend is almost nonexistent)

"AITA for saying to my Uber ""this is how you get 1-star ratings"" as I got out, and leaving a $0.01 tip?. I know it sounds horrible but hear me out. Fuck I'm still livid from this. Luckily it was only $4.24 which I won't lose sleep over but anything above 10 if this happened I would have pushed to get the fare waived.

So it's 12:30 am, had a fun night, tired and wanna go home, I'm maybe a 15-20 minute walk from home but decide to Uber it, and since I'm not in a crazy rush I go for the Uber Pool to save money, after all I'm only a 5 minute ride from home anyway.

And yeah, I'm well-aware the pool can be wonky sometimes. It connects me to this driver who it says is 5 minutes away. Of course, with the pool I know that's not always accurate because anyone can pick it up. Okay.

So I start to see him go in the opposite direction to pick up ""Charlotte"". Alright, so be it. He's lingering for a bit in circles in an area 5-7 minutes away, eventually her name disappears.

But then... in the next 10 minutes (yes, 10), I watch him continue going in the opposite direction... towards the other side of town. No more names appear in this time. He keeps moving further and further away... and becomes twice as far away from me as he was when he picked up ""Charlotte"". I consider cancelling and ordering again, but don't want to deal with the cancellation fee, so I try calling him.

After the second attempt, I finally get him and give him a demanding earful - ""hey dude, it's succulentboobs, what's going on?! I've been waiting at the corner of [location] almost 20 minutes, I've just seen you going in the opposite direction, what's the deal?""

He just responds with ""okay I'm on my way"".

Sure enough, he turns around immediately and comes to get me. I'm prepared to pummel him with questions, but when he finally gets here there's another girl in there and he seems chill ad briefly apologizes so I decide to let it go and not cause a scene.

But then, as he's going in my direction, right halfway to my house, he drops off the girl and says ""have a good night Charlotte"". I was ready to let it go, but this just raised the question - if this girl was in fact Charlotte and going in the same direction as me, then WHY the blooming hell was he going in the opposite direction from there for over five minutes straight after he picked her up? Especially when he was supposed to pick me up at a place that was directly on the way! And furthermore, why did I have to call him to get him to actually come in my direction? It seems like that's what got him to turn around and he wouldn't have otherwise.

So I confront him about this - turns out Charlotte was also having him pick up her friend and get them somewhere (off the grid, which explains why I didn't see any names), and when I asked him why he's prioritizing that over his actual orders - he actually straight up admitted that he forgot I was even there as a pending order and my call reminded him. He apologized but I told him that's not cool and reminded him how long I was waiting, and... you know the rest.

"AITA? Parents asked me for student loans to pay for their car, I said I needed to know more and now I'm cut off..  Background: My parents are Bosnian, I was born in America but I've been living in Sarajevo for years now. Here, student loans are the easiest loan to pay off, normal loans can have an interest rate of up to 25% but students get it for 3%. Finally, my parents aren't religious, but I've been trying to be faithful for the past few years after doing my own research.

They sat me down last night and asked me if I could consider taking out a student loan in my name so they could buy the car they wanted. I've never taken a loan out, and in my faith most of those things aren't really allowed, and to top it all off I applied for a study exchange program so I won't even be in the country soon. I told all that to my parents, asking them for time to think and do my own research, especially since I didn't want anything to go wrong when I wasn't there to help.

They. Went. Ballistic. My mother told me to leave her life at one point, because she couldn't ""trust me anymore"" and if I couldn't help her out, she wouldn't help me. They completely cut me off financially, which means now I'm left trying to find a way to earn the money I need without failing some university courses due to attendance. My father won't talk to me except to tell me how all my cousins took out loans for THIER families, and how they didn't raise me right.

Over and over again, I've tried to explain that my trust isn't flawed in them: I trust them more than anybody else. But I'm not going to blindly put my trust in paperwork that could screw me over. When I signed up for university, I read the full contract TWICE before signing, and they applauded that same wariness. But on them? I might as well have shot them both.

Since then, I've talked with them as much as I could, but they're steadfast in leaving me out of the family. From what I see, they're reacting in this way because, as my parents, they can get around any thought process I'd give to a normal person. For all they preach that they make mistakes too, if I try to live by that judgement, they crucify me. At this point I have no clue whether they overreacted or whether I should have just said yes in the first place.

"AITA for wanting my wife to come to my work event. This weekend there’s a conference about an hour away. The majority of people bring their spouse. It generally makes you look more professional and put together, don’t ask me why but all my coworkers who have been going longer say make your wife go, or you won’t do well.

So I told my wife about it and she says she doesn’t want to go because it’s going to be boring and she just wants to stay home and relax. I’d love to stay home too, but sometimes you have to go out and do stuff.

"AITA for trying to bow out of a talk?. I prepared since July for a presentation I was asked to do for a volunteer/non-profit org. The org is awesome and important in my eyes, so this was a huge privilege. I have never done this before, so I invested many hours to doing a presentation on what I realized was a very broad topic. 

Shortly After I was told that I'd be doing the presentation, the organizer advised that someone else would be ""co-presenting"" with me. They said that they didn't want me to feel like it's not ""my"" presentation, but that she offered to help and would be a good partner, etc. I don't have a love for speaking, so I felt this was a blessing.

This other presenter was basically unresponsive to contact until about 5 days ago. She called me to go over it, and she said:“I want this to be open dialogue, not lecture style”. (I agreed.) I don’t love speaking in front of people, so I felt like that was a way to keep it simple.

The other presenter is older (77) with a pedigree education and insights, so I felt obligated to defer to her. I don’t have that same education or background.

Day of presentation: she completely spoke at random about anecdotes that weren't even related to the topic. Ex: ""i have a friend who came up with a quote (insert basic life quote), isn’t that clever?” The presentation was not about this at all. She also wasn’t able to really connect with the diverse audience; she herself seemed to have a very different socioeconomic status, which made her seem even more clueless. 

**Key point:** When she was talking, apparently we were given a ""5 minutes left"" warning from the timekeeper, but the timekeeper was not in my line of sight. I began to bring up a point that seemed relevant, and the woman STOPPED me ""I'm going to cut you off right there; we only have 5 minutes left and I want to do some breathing exercises before we end (with the audience).""

I was so embarrassed that she did that in front of the audience. We had more presentations to go, so I told our organizer that I would just rather this other presenter be given full attention and I would sit with the audience. The organizer was super sympathetic, she felt terrible for me. 

But, when I tried to bow out, the co-presenter would NOT have it. She tried to explain what she did, and then said for me to just sit there with her again. When I said that I had some points that were related to the topic, she said “oh, I don’t believe in lecturing, so that’s why I’m not using a presentation.”

I sat up front with her, trying not to seethe about her cutting me off abruptly, but I felt that I could be the AH for having voiced the plan to sit out. I also felt sorry for our organizer, who probably was worried I was mad/offended.

Was I the AH for trying to give the woman her own spotlight after she basically cut me off in front of the first group?","NTA

"WIBTA if I don't tell my dad that I out-earn him?. I (22F) recently finished college and moved back in with my dad while I job hunt.  We agreed I would pay $100-$200 in rent every month starting after I get a job, plus I've been splitting groceries and utilities out of what little savings I have in the meantime.  My dad and I agreed that these next few months with him are to give me some breathing room to put away some actual savings.

  I love my dad but he is very bad with money.  He makes $47K a year, his parents paid off his house and car so he has no mortgage or car payments, they've paid off every single penny of his credit card debt for him numerous times (about 30K in the last 15 years), and yet he ALWAYS says he's broke less than a week after every single payday.  I literally have *no* idea where all of that money goes.  Almost everyone in my family apart from my dad has worked in finance and they've all tried to help him go over his finances and work out a budget but it never does anything except cause tension.

  I'm now in the final callbacks for a job making $55K a year and therefore I'd out-earn him.  He's been asking how much this job pays but I'm afraid to tell him in case he wants me to pay more in rent/utilities/etc. or starts asking me to cover things that we never agreed on. We made the original agreement both thinking I wouldn't be able to find anything that paid much more than minimum wage, so part of me thinks it's only fair that I pay more since it was kind of like a sliding-scale rent system.  Also I'm worried that I'd be taking advantage of him if I lied about how much I make just to keep living there low-rent.  The other part of me thinks it would be unfair of my dad to expect more money just because I have it.  With me paying for all of the resources I use *plus* paying rent, he's still making/saving more money with me living here than he would if I moved out.  

Of course, I might lose this job at the last minute and then this will all be pointless, but I'm still curious what the internet thinks.  WIBTA if I don't bring it up?","NTA

"AITA for not wanting my husband to take my car instead of his?. Yes, I understand how petty the title sounds, but please allow me to explain.

He has a 2008 and I have a 2013. His car is manual and mine is automatic (surprised?). I can drive his car, but barely. I'm very short, so reaching the clutch is really difficult for me to do. I have to push the seat up as far as it goes and still twist my body slightly in order to fully engage the clutch and change gears. Sitting so close to the steering wheel makes it difficult to turn. It's really uncomfortable. Since it's so awkward to drive his car, I stall out and am definitely a hazard to myself and others. I hate that I can't drive it well.. and feel unsafe driving his car. 

There is also only 1 key to his car cause he somehow lost the other one (that's another story..). Most the time when he leaves, he doesn't leave the key for me anyway.

There are certain times he wants to take my car somewhere instead of his own. Why? Just because he wants to take my car... no functional reasons or anything like that. If something is wrong with his car, that's a different story. So I'm forced to stay home with no means of escape. This makes me anxious for various reasons:

* We have 2 kids, a 2.5 y.o. and an 8 wk. old. If I have no car, I have no means to escape for an emergency. If there's a fire or other ER at home, I can't get my kids in the car to go someplace warm and safe. I don't want to risk my kids' lives because I can't drive his car.

* If he has an accident and ends up in the hospital, I can't get down there easily. 

* If the car breaks down and he needs a ride, I'm no help. Can't go get him. If I take Lyft, I have to get the car seats in their cars (do they even allow that?) and somehow lug them and my 2 kids around after.  That also costs money.

* We're alone out here.. no family nearby and really no friends. We moved here a few years ago and man is it hard to start over and make new friends, and our family is all 2+ hrs away. Limited support to ask for a ride.

* He is fully aware of my inability to drive his car even if he did leave me the key.

* He has horrible cell phone etiquette.. it's not always charged, is prepaid and sometimes out of minutes, it's usually on silent so he doesn't even hear it, and sometimes he loses it and doesn't even have it on him. So if you're thinking I can just call him and he'll come home that's not ways the case!

There are various other things my paranoid brain thinks of, but I'm not going to list everything. 

Now, I've explained my concerns to him several times. Sometimes he obliges, but most times he tells me to stop by ""BS."" He knows I don't like feeling stuck with no independent way to get around. I understand in a true ER there are ER vehicles and personnel, and if I REALLY need to get somewhere I can find a way, but I shouldn't need to rely on 3rd parties if I have my own reliable transportation. If he's going someplace close, fine, but most the time he's going someplace 20 mins away. Which means he's gone for a few hours at a time.

I'll admit it: at times I do feel like an asshole because it's not the end of the world. I get that. But the fact that he completely dismisses my concerns like they're nothing really hurts. I believe my concerns are valid. Besides, why the hell shouldn't I have access to my own car, especially the only one I can drive?

"AITA for slow dancing with my friend's girlfriend at a wedding?. Yeah, I know the title makes me seem like the asshole already, but please just hear me out.

Yesterday was the wedding of one of my buddies from college. There were a bunch of guys from our class so I (25M) was looking forward to having a reunion with my boys. It was beautiful venue and everyone was having a blast. I was dancing with some guys since I went stag (my girlfriend is out of country for a conference and couldn't make it). When slow songs would come on, I would retire and go sit back at a table and have a drink. All was great. However, then I noticed that a girl was sitting alone at the table next to mine and I recognized that she was the date of another guy, ""Brian"", who I was friends with in college.

Now, I wouldn't have approached, but I saw that she was crying so after awhile I went over and sat down next to her to ask if she was okay. She was very embarrassed and told me that she was fine but that she was just upset because Brian and her had gotten into an argument during dinner (she did not specify over what) and that now he was upset at her and wasn't talking to her. She told me she was really looking forward to this evening and now she felt so sad and hurt. I asked her if she knew where Brian was and she said no and that he left some time ago and she could not find him. Then she made an off-handed comment that was something like, ""Ugh, I love this song. I really wanted to dance to this tonight."" Then she started crying again and I felt really terrible. It was a bit impulsive, but I asked if she wanted to dance with me and she said sure so we went and danced. It was a slow song, but I kept my distance. She was still crying and put her cheek on my shoulder. It was a bit awkward for me, but since she was so upset I just let her cry it out.

After about maybe two or three minutes, I get a hand on my shoulder and it's Brian. He says, ""Dude?! What are you doing??"" She immediately lets go of me and I think he realized that she was crying so he asked her what's wrong. She burst into tears again and he took her away after that. After like twenty minutes, Brian found me with a couple of other guys and took me aside to tell me that I totally disrespected him by ""taking advantage of his girlfriend's emotional state."" I told him exactly what happened and he seemed reluctant to believe me and continued to tell me that I was being a dick and that what I did was not okay. He left angrily and I went back to the guys I was with and told them what happened. To my surprise, all of them said that although they could see my point of view, it was still a bit of an asshole move and they said if that ever happened, to just mind my own shit. Welp okay.

I told my girlfriend what happened and she said she thought it was fine, but it's literally only us who think that lol.

"AITA : Conversation with potential landlord. Today I tried to call a potential landlord. I made the call from while I was so outside so it perhaps it was too noisy for him to hear me due to traffic. So the first time I called him, he couldn't hear me at all and went ""hello?"" a few times before he hung up because he couldn't hear my responses at all.

He called back a few minutes later:

Me: Hello, I am interested in your 2 bed room apartment.

Him: When are you looking to move in?

Me: Mid to late August

Him: Mid?

Me (in a louder voice) Mid to late August!

Him: Mid?

Me: (in a louder voice practically shouting) Mid to late August!

Him: Mid?

I got frustrated then because I was speaking as loudly as I could and he still couldn't hear me. I wasn't frustrated at him because I knew it wasn’t his fault he couldn’t hear me. But I was frustrated since I realised that the outside noise was possibly interfering with our conversation and so I figured I would need to call him back when I was in a quieter place.

So really loudly, practically shouting, I went "" Can I call you back later?"". I realise it may have come out in rude way since I was practically yelling into the phone and I admit that some of my frustration could have shown. But he could barely hear my 4 word reply earlier, so I figured  he wouldn't even be able to hear me if I went to a lengthy explanation about the traffic noise and requesting if I could call back.

I waited a few seconds for him to reply but he was silent and then he cut the call. I did not hit the end call button.

He called me again a few minutes later and launched into an angry tirade.

Him You were so rude! The landlord doesn't have to adjust to the tenant's wishes! It's tenants that have to be accommodating. You are so rude and I am no longer interested in letting this place out to you because I can tell that you are not a good person!

Me:What do you mean I was rude?

Him: You cut the call! You are Indian aren't you?

(As a matter of fact I am ethnically Indian though I don’t live there or have an Indian accent. I think he guessed this from my name I left on a voicemail message. Interestingly he had an accent which sounded South Asian himself.)

Him: All you people are like this! All you Indians are so rude and I just want to say don't call back!

Me: What do you mean I cut the call? You cut the call!

Him: I don't want to talk to you anymore. All you people are like that! I don't want to give you the apartment so don't call back!

Me: Then why did you call back in the first place?

Him: Because I wanted to tell you how rude you are! Okay I am not interested in talking to you anymore! Please don't ever contact this number!

"AITA for not going to my parents for the holidays?. Sorry this might be long lol

So some background information. I’ve never really had a good relationship with my mother. She was emotionally distant and always saying rude things to me. My mother has told me that “nobody will want to date you if you look like a boy” (I’m trans ftm) and other insults. 2 months ago I came out to her and the rest of the family as being transgender, and at first she was supportive. But since then shit has hit the fan. A few weeks ago, she decided to send me an email about how I will regret my “choice” of being transgender, how I’ll want to detransition, and sent me various youtube videos about detranstitioning. After that, I stopped talking to her.

Fast forward to last weekend, my parents drove 2 hours up to my college at 9am on Saturday. One of my roommates let them into the apartment, and my mother decided to knock at my bedroom door until I opened it. I didn't even know they were even coming up. The whole time, she lectured me about being trans and how I’m tearing the family apart. She also went on to say that I should seek a qualified therapist and drop out of college so I can rethink my choice of “becoming transgender” and that I am just wanting to be accepted so I “decided” to be transgender.

The whole family dynamic is whack and toxic. I’ve done my best to be patient with her, and I have tried to educate her, but she just sees it as me believing lies from the internet. I’ve asked her to call me by my chosen name, and she outright refuses to, and still will not make an effort to try.

Anyways, I wasn’t planning on going back to my parents' place for the holidays, simply because I do not want to be stuck in a house where I know I am not accepted. I feel like my parents are honestly ashamed of me being transgender. They have asked me to come back for the holidays but I just think they want to pretend that everything is normal. None of this has been resolved, and I feel like it will be hell to be there. Am I an asshole for not coming back to their place for the holidays?

"AITA for not stopping for this wreck?. I'm a nurse surgeons assistant, and I was on-call for a night. At around midnight, I was called into work for multiple potential trauma surgeries. 

I have 45 minutes to get in from the time I'm called. I'm driving just below the speed limit being extra careful at night, and I get on this road that merges from two lanes to only the left lane. 

An SUV was tailgating me for miles before we got to that point, was swerving in and out of their lane, generally being jackass. I'd put money on him being drunk.

"AITA for getting my boss fired for not training me properly?. TLDR: While training me, my manager didn't inform me of a very important rule that I broke, and we both got fired because of it.

I got hired as a cashier at a store, that's part of a large nationwide franchise. I had worked a few jobs before, but they were all smaller stores, and were not really all that uptight about rules and procedures. But this new place was very formal, they made me sign 20 different forms gave me a giant stack of papers to keep in my records or whatever. I remind you this is a minimum wage cashier job.

I should mention that when you're an employee here, they give you an employee discount card under your name. This is important.

Anyways, I was trained by my manager for a while beforehand. It was early in the morning, the store was completely empty and I had nothing to do. I was hungry and my break was in about an hour.  So I grabbed a snack from the store and purchased it on my own register using my discount card and put it on the counter behind me to eat on my break.

My manager later came to check up on me and when she saw the snack, she asked who's it was. I said it was mine. She asked if I bought it during my shift. I said yes. She asked if I used my card, I said yes. Her face went pale and got extremely angry at me, saying it's *highly* against policy to ""go shopping"" during my shift. I was surprised because I never had this with my previous jobs, in fact I was always encouraged by my bosses to buy from the store, even if it's during my shift. I said I was sorry and I simply didn't know, but she was very worried, less about what I did, but about her boss finding out, because apparently he always looks over the cashier records, and he would see that I went shopping during my shift, since I used my card and it records my name.

That was odd to me because my mom went shopping in this store before, while I'm on my shift, and I let her use my card for the discount. So the cash register should have still recorded me ""shopping""  during my shift but no one ever noticed that back then?

The next day I came to work and I saw my manager but she was frantically walking around everywhere, worried. I was called in by the office and was fired. I didn't really mind, as it was just a part time job. But I was a little ticked off that no one informed me of such an apparently extremely important rule and just expected me to have known.

I never saw that manager work there again, and a few weeks later, I went back to the store to buy something, and I saw a former co-worker (who was really close to the manager) and she was so extremely cold and passive aggressive towards me, she clearly hated me.

I assume my manager was fired for what I did, and I felt very guilty about it. I never meant for someone to lose their job because of me. But again, I was never informed of such a *huge* rule. Do people just know these things?? I just assumed it wouldn't be a problem since my other jobs were fine with it and I was never informed otherwise?

"AITA For Not Wanting My Father at My Wedding?. Throwaway since some family members have reddit.

TL;DR: I'm not close with my father and don't want him at my small wedding, so my mother and brother are refusing to attend unless I change my mind.

My fiance recently proposed to me and we're planning to get married in 2021. We have talked about this for a long time and I jumped on planning really quickly. We have always wanted to have a small ceremony with only our closest friends and family there, about 10 people then about 75-100 people at the reception. I was telling my mum about this plan yesterday and she mentioned how my father was excited to walk me down the aisle.

Now my father and I have never been close. He always seemed really cold towards me to the point of sometimes ignoring me and quickly getting aggressive whenever I messed up when I was younger. He was never supportive of me and it always felt like I had to battle just to get him to acknowledge me. I was never a bad behaved kid but I did have undiagnosed ADHD and abandonment anxiety from a young age so maybe he just didn't know how to handle me. He was completely different with my younger brother, and was extremely affectionate and kind to him. It really hurt for a long time.

When I was 19 I finally moved out and I have barely spoke to him since. Now I'm 23 and marrying the love of my life who he hasn't ever spoken to. I don't believe he deserves a place at my wedding and definitely doesn't deserve to walk me down the aisle and I told my mother this.

"AITA if I angrily confronted my friend about his bad breath?. So I think I fucked up, and I need to know if I was an asshole. I am pretty sure I am because I lost my temper, but...an outside perspective would help.

I run a gaming group (tabletop games like D&D, for context) that meets twice a month. One player has absolutely atrocious breath. Like other than that his hygiene is good and he's a really stand up guy. I've taken him aside twice in private to mention the breath issue very gently to him, offered him a mint, but he pointed out that no one else said anything to him, and he thought I was being rather rude. Anyways I noticed the other players started...not sitting as close to him as they used to, and I was pretty sure it was due to his gross breath. I'd tried to be gentle about this already, but when one of them scooted away when he moved his chair closer, he got mad and asked why we were all avoiding him at the table. It was so fucking uncomfortable and awkward, so I blurted, ""Dude, your breath is fucking *horrible*. I've tried telling you nicely and in private, but you keep not fixing it. Have a goddamn breath mint, and we'll all sit closer at the table. Don't want a breath mint? Then don't bitch when we don't want to sit near you sometimes.""

He got furious that I said this in front of everyone and left the group for that evening, saying that he'd never felt more humiliated in his life at a gaming group and that I didn't have to be so harsh. One of my players was grateful at my outburst (since him leaving meant they didn't have to smell his breath any more) but felt that I could have been way nicer about it & probably went overboard. One of my players thought my behavior was absolutely appalling and felt that I should have rode out the bad night, talked to everyone first, and then come up with a politer plan where we could all have had a gentle sit-down with him about the problem. One of my players 100% supported me and said that if he didn't want to get chewed out, maybe he should have listened when he got feedback before. We've all known each other a while, and I think my swearword-laden outburst may have torpedo'd my friendship with the bad-breath player, in all honesty. He said he isn't coming back to the game night. 

I kind of don't think he deserved any more polite approaches; I feel like he was an asshole to me for brushing me off when I was nice, so I feel justified in how I handled this even though I suspect it probably does make me the asshole. AITA?","NTA, you tried the soft approach and it didn't work.  He then asked what was going on and you told him the truth.

Could you have been softer?  Yes.  Were you being an asshole considering the circumstances?  No.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for yelling at a kid at the movies?.  Over the holidays my family went out to see the new Spiderman movie at the theater. We got there a little early, got all our snacks and got to watch some of those pre-movie commercials.

So far all good.

Right before the movie starts a dad comes in with his kid (probably late elementary school, 10 or so?) near the middle of the row we are in. Immediately the kid starts to have a screaming tantrum about how he doesn't want to sit next to strangers. He's kicking his seat and smacking food onto the floor. The dad tries to make him hush quietly but the kid won't stop screaming. Other people in the theater are turning around to look at him but no one is saying anything.

The kid doesn't stop even when the actual movie starts and the dad still hasn't taken him out of the theater. By this point I'm irritated enough to start a conflict so I duck through the row and loud whisper to the dad something along the lines of 'get your fucking brat kid out of here or I'll find someone else to kick you out' (ok so maybe yelling wasn't the right word to use). The dad looks mortified and doesn't say anything, just pulls his kid up and walks out of the theater.

In retrospect maybe I should have just gotten an usher but in the moment I was too irritated to be 100% rational. I think the dad was probably stressed out and just didn't know what to do with his sucky kid, so for that I kind of feel bad, like I should have handled the situation differently.

TL;DR Kid is loud and obnoxious at the movies, I confront the (probably exhausted dad) and tell him to get out.

&#x200B;",ESH. The dad should've taken his child out of the theater when he wouldn't stop yelling but you didn't need to talk to the poor guy like that. He probably had enough problems with his screaming child. You should've asked an usher to kick them out.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA For Not Saying Hello? Hear Me Out.. I used to always say hello to my step-dad whenever he came home from work as well as ask him how his day was.
We didn't have much in common so most our conversations went like this.

Step-dad walks in
Me: Hey (name)! How was your day?
Step-dad: Shit.
Me: Aha same here.

Eventually he started saying ""I don't know why you bother asking"" and I told him that I figured I should ask in case he had a good day.
He kept saying this so eventually I stopped talking whenever he came home and he complained to my mom saying ""She never talks to me anymore"" even though he got mad because I was talking to him. I've tried starting discussions with him as well as show him a few drawings I've made and he just says ""Not right now"" and puts his headphones in.

So, long story short: He complains to me when I talk and he complains to my mom when I don't. I don't know if I did anything wrong.

"AITA For not wanting to drive my sister everywhere all the time when I'm trying to sleep?. So for some backstory. My sister and I currently live together with my mom. I had my own apartment and everything was fine. My mom sold her house but didn't find a suitable home to purchase afterwards, so she literally begged me to get into a rental with her. I was going month to month with my landlord so it was simple. Now I pay rent at the rental home, same as my mom. Sister is there just going to school.

Little did I know that moving in was going to have strings attached. I work nights. 10 hour shifts. I come home around 11AM and just want to sleep. My sister gets out of school around 1:30PM. So I currently have to wake up, drive to pick her up, bring her back, and try to get back to sleep. 

I then go to work that night and feel like absolute piss. I'm writing this from my office, about to snooze.

Am I the asshole? I want to tell her no more rides unless it's absolutely necessary. She can wait for me to wake up at least.","Ohhhh wow, lol that changes everything! She’s a grown woman, my friend.

"WIBTA if I told my girlfriend to hold off on safety deposits for summer trips because I don't know if we'll still be together then?. Backstory, I'm 23, she's 22, both in graduate school, together for two years, and her family is much better off than mine- in light of that fact, she's talked about multiple trips/high-price activities (scuba lessons, vacations outside of the country, expensive purchases for my summer birthday) that she wants to do this summer, and has already made plans with her parents, who will be paying for them in part, to pay safety deposits for said activities within the next month.

Our current situation is very rocky- we each have had some problems we're been working through that have jeopardized our relationship, and we've recently had our fair share of big fights that have further strained our relationship. The past week we had a two-hour long argument over our current living situation (we live together), ending with her simply stating that if she had to go to her parents to get money for a better apartment, she would- on principle, I don't like to take money from anyone, much less my girlfriend's parents. The point being, the relationship is not strong, is in a very rough patch right now, and could be much better.

Our relationship is extremely strained right now, and right now it's difficult to see where it can go- at this point, it could go either way by the time we would even be putting her safety deposits to use. On the one hand, I don't want to feel like some asshole saying 'Don't make those safety deposits, I don't know if we'll still be together by then', but on the other hand, I don't want her to have paid for all of those activities (many of which are couples activities), and then us no longer being together and that money being completely wasted- not all of it being her money, but money wasted, still.

We've both had our share of trips and activities that we've split down the middle, payment wise, but her summer plans are 2x-3x the amount of our most expensive trip or activity.

"AITA for Trying to Help a Friend?. Hey everyone I created a fake name for posting this to keep all anon. Had a best friend of 12 years who moved in with me. They didn't have all the advantages that I did. I didn't grow up wealthy, but I came from a middle class household with two married parents.

Said friend, we'll call him Joe moved in and did very well eventually meeting a significant other who moved in. At first things went well but the SO left after a year. They got back together and moved back in 6 months later. In the meantime Joe started to get spotty in his attendance at work. Started to show a losing care for the world. Eventually Joe lost his job for walking off in the middle of his shift after receiving criticism from his superior. I had other roommates at the time and offered to help them with community or a trade school to better themselves. Joe didn't take advantage. 

After Joe left his job I helped Joe get several others including other friends to which he kept leaving shortly after starting. The total number was about 6-7 in about 6 months. Most of which were less than 1 week at a time. Joe was often sitting around playing video games passing time (to cope with his derpession) and that's when his SO left the second time. Joe at this point was 3 months behind on rent and focused on supporting his ""habits"" over making up on his responsibilities. I offered to help Joe make a payment plan everytime he started a job to get back on track. 

At this time his father passed away from cancer and things began to worsen over the next few months. Eventually Joe started to get aggressive with the roommates and ultimately ended with him to scream at the neighbor and blame us for not getting involved. It led to a conversation that caused Joe to leave shortly after. AITA? He has a history of depression but he ended up not taking advantage when we brought a psychiatrist to his aid. It's hard to let friends go without the benefit of the doubt but I was truly at my wits end. Could I have done anything different than send him on his way?"," NTA.

"AITA for not inviting a trans friend on holiday?. I should preface this story with two facts.

1) We're not really friends, she is more part of my friend group that I hang out with.

2) I'm Muslim and whilst not as strict as some I still consider myself a Muslim.

My parents have retired back to my mother's birth country and bought an old house that they've restored. It's a traditional North African house so has things like a hammam (sauna) and is located in the centre of the old city so it's a hot tourist destination. The country in question is VERY Muslim and as such is homophobic and transphobic. My parents have been restoring the houses for nearly a decade now and modernising it and to celebrate they asked if I wanted to invite some friends round and they could visit the country/town.

I immediately asked some of my friends and we've planned the trip for Spring 2020. Someone asked if I wanted to invite our MtF trans friend I said that it wouldn't be a good idea. I have always kept my opinions to myself and never discussed my thoughts with anyone, but she does not pass at all and very obviously has a man's body. My parents would very much be against having her there and I'm pretty sure she might be attacked if she were to come. She would also have to wear a headscarf when we visit some sites (already explained to female friends who are happy to do so) and it would be seen as very disrespectful as people would assume it's a man mocking the religion. 

She found out that I didn't invite her and accused me of being transphobic in our group chat. I tried explaining that for her own safety it would be best if she didn't come (and truthfully I just don't like her) and that my parents would not be happy with the situation. She's not hearing any of it though and is turning this into a huge issue now.

Only my best friend is aware I dislike her, the rest have no idea because I don't want to cause conflict in the group ironically. And I do not dislike her because she's trans.

AITA?","NTA. Putting aside all of the controversial aspects of this post (which, frankly, feels a little like baiting)...you two aren’t close friends. I wouldn’t invite someone who wasn’t a close friend on a trip out of the country.

"AITA For taking my brother off my insurance and my name off his car?. Recent lurker first time poster as well as on mobile yada yada

Some background all my life it’s just been my mom, brother and I as my dad is shit and so is most of his family as well as my moms family. I am 23F and my brother is 19M and is honestly spoiled. My mom with me was strict I couldn’t go out with friends until I was like 17 nor could I just take her car whenever etc. Like if I talked back etc I’d get my ass beat but my brother? He got to be out till late and take her car whenever when he was only 15/16. 

We grew up somewhat poor not gonna lie but you best believe he had an Xbox iPod etc where’s I was lucky if I could convince her to let me get something nice. I had to work for all my shit where’s he got to sit on his ass eat and play Xbox all day. Anyway me and my mom do not get along at all (surprise surprise), I moved to a city 45 mins away and rarely talk to her or my brother. Before I moved he got this shitty Toyota Corolla from our step dad and my mom basically guilt tripped me/forced me to put his car under my insurance as well as under my name cause if he got insurance on his own or put it under his name it’d be hella expensive because he’s young etc. 

He has been on it for a year now & it’s been hell, I have to constantly remind him to pay me the $45 for his part or I literally have to threaten taking him off to pay me. I’m honestly getting tired of it, and recently I’ve found out he’s smoking weed which is whatever I do 2 but he’s being dumb about it. For example he’s always snap chatting him smoking or like the bag of weed or recently HIM SMOKING AND DRIVING AROUND. Oh and of course my mom doesn’t care nor says anything to him, but it’s one thing if he did it at home etc but now he’s risking my rate going up as well as me getting in trouble because the car is under my name!!!

After finding this out I told him that after this next month he is off my insurance I don’t care how much he whines or begs because I’ve had enough, I also told him he better have money ready to register the car in his name as I am taking my name off and cancelling the plates. Of course this did not go over well, he blew up my phone with calls and texts. Calling me a bitch, stuck up, that I must hate him, he doesn’t need me he’s grown, all the way to fake crying and begging me to please keep it in my name and the insurance because he doesn’t have money. But yet he’s got money for weed, going out to eat, going out with friends etc!?!? Yeah right. 

Now my mom is also blowing up my phone pleading on my brothers behalf/ guilt tripping me again. At this point I’m ready to just put him back on so I don’t have to deal with my phone being blown up.

"AITA for having my dad pay for my college, but then ghosting him for the rest of my life?. I'm in nursing school right now, and my dad is putting me through it. I am very gracious for this, and I know that this makes me more privileged than others. Although, I don't think this excuses what he has done (and is still doing) to my family.

I'm going to attempt to make a long story short. I'm originally from Spain (Mom = Spanish, Dad = Filipino). My dad is in the Navy so that's how he got himself to Spain where he met my mother. I grew up in Spain for 10 years, and then we got stationed in America. Ever since my dad got the chance to put the whole Atlantic Ocean between my mom and her family he has been treating her like complete, utter, absolute shit. 

I think my dad has some sort of Bipolar Disorder or PTSD, but at this point I don't care because I wish he would drop dead tbh. For 11 years he has been treating my mom, 4 siblings, and I like garbage. He justifies it all because he pays for everything, and that sense of control/power over us has made him do some pretty ballsy stuff. My mom deals with it because she wants to wait until my youngest sister gets her college paid for by him, and then she wants to go back to Spain (I am going to make this happen for her). 

For some more context, my mom is a pretty independant woman. Regardless of his verbal and sometimes physical abuse, she managed to get a job out here and she managed to learn english. Although, because of this, the abuse just gets worse. My dad always falsely accuses her of cheating and being a whore. This usually occurs when my mom goes to work, my dad really believes that she actually prostitutes herself. He will go around the house yelling that she's a whore, loud enough for my baby sisters to hear. I have tried to tell him to grow up and settle things the mature way, keep the arguing contained, my sisters don't have to hear this bs. He just takes this offensively and threatens to kick me out (this was back when I was in High School). Now that I really can get legaly kicked out, my mom told me to stay on his good side. My mom is depressed, and tired if this. 

I am a couple months away from graduation. I am grateful that I get my school paid for, I am lucky. But I want to cut ties with this asshole after I'm done. I always imagine myself taking care of my mother when she gets older, but I will gladly pay for the cheapest, shitiest nursing home for my father.

"AITA for not promising to pay the family phone bill when I graduate?. I (26F) just got off the phone with my mother and she acted like I was being really awful, so I’m looking for some second opinions.

Some background: my parents are well off. My mother is an exec and has been making close to half a million dollars a year. I was lucky enough to graduate from college with no debt in part because they were able to pay the remainder after a generous scholarship + my graduating early. Then I worked for a few years, off of their payroll, but they’ve always been generous with gifts. For example, they’ve still invited me and my brother (22M) on family vacations and they helped me with a down payment on my first apartment.

I'm in my second year at law school, and at the onset my mother generously offered to cover whatever I couldn’t. Well, it turns out law school was a good investment in this case—I’m at the top of my class, and landed a summer associateship next year at one of the top firms in the country. The pay from that summer will fully cover my last year’s tuition, and these kinds of internships often result in an offer at market rate after graduation.

Our family is close, and I’ve always told my mother that I would be happy to do for her + my dad in retirement what she did for me + my brother if I could afford it. But she’s also planned very well for retirement, so there’s never been any expectation that they couldn’t cover their own bills.

Well, out of the blue today while we were on the phone my mom told me that she thinks I should cover the “family” cell account when I’ve graduated. The plan would include parents, my brother (graduating from a prestigious college with an engineering degree this year), and me. I expressed confusion because I figured me + bro would be splitting off after graduation. She kept pushing and making excuses about how it would be “cheaper” to all be together (but it definitely wouldn’t be cheaper for me to cover a $400 plan). I wouldn’t fold. I reiterated to her that I would be trying to restore my savings account and budgeting once I started working since I will have depleted my savings completely and basically earned negative income for three years. Then she started pulling out all of the things she’s paid for in the past and asking when I would pay her back for those, if I wouldn’t “even” cover their phone bill. 

It’s not that I wouldn’t try to cover them if they were in actual financial danger (I told her that), but I don’t want her or anyone else to be planning to spend a salary that I’m not even making yet literally over a year in advance. 

But she sounded so legitimately hurt, like I was just throwing her and my father to the wolves and being ungrateful for what they’ve done for me. I know my life has been MONUMENTALLY easier because of their help. But I’ve been taught to make good financial choices, and it seems like a really dumb one to promise to spend money that I don’t have on someone who makes more than 99% of the country. 

AITA? Should I have just agreed to help?

EDIT: Trying to stay under 3000 characters made this more confusing. First: I haven't lived in the family home since I was 21. I paid my own bills from 21-25. Second: Mother's original arrangement was to put me on family payroll while I'm in law school but deplete my savings + let me contribute as much as possible with summer jobs, then come back off the phone plan (and all of the ""shared"" family accounts) and pay for myself completely once I graduate.","NTA.

"AITA for saying I didn't get a ""real"" DUI?. Two years ago I was a freshman in college and still very new to drinking. I was invited to a Halloween party off campus and decided to go with my friend, who I'll call Amy. The plan was for me to drive to Amy's dorm and we would walk to the party from there, then Uber or walk back and sleep in her dorm for the night. The party was your typical college Halloween spectacle and I'll be honest, we drank way too much. When we decided to head back, and I got an Uber for us back to her dorm. On the way there, Amy got a text from another girl on her floor that the RA was on duty and stopping everyone who came in to make sure they were okay because there had been some instances of alcohol poisoning in dorm buildings. There's no rules about going back to your dorm if you're drunk, they just don't want anyone there who might be a danger to themselves or others. I told her we should just be upfront with the RA about having been drinking that night but also explain to her that we planned the night out and we were just going to sleep it off in her dorm. Amy didn't think that was a good idea, and told me that I couldn't go in with her.

I told her that I wasn't going to walk back to my dorm at 3am so I would just Uber back and get my car in the morning. Then she changed her mind about me sleeping there, and said that she woud go in, talk the the RA, and come back out for me once everything was cleared with her. I said that was fine and asked her to text me updates about the situation once she went inside. I waited outside on the steps while she went in and I got a text from her saying that the RA let her go to her room without an issue. I asked when she would be coming back for me and she said 20 minutes. I decided to wait in my car that was parked there since it was extremely hot and my costume was uncomfortable. I sat in the front seat, turned on the A/C (the key wasn't turned all the way so the car never actually started) and reclined the seat back because I wanted to get some rest. I fell asleep at some point because I woke up to campus police knocking on my window. Long story short, I got charged with DUI because I was in my car with the key in the ignition and it had been over an hour since Amy said she would come and let me in.

Here's where the main question comes in. Amy still brings up the night I got a DUI and has even mentioned it to other friends which has caused some issues because they immediately judge me for it. I told her I didn't get a ""real"" DUI because I never drove, and she told me ""that's not what your background check is gonna say"" which seriously hurt me. I kick myself every day for being so stupid and not just ordering an Uber, but I still feel like the arrest wasn't warranted. I feel like Amy looks down on me (and everyone who finds out about the DUI) and I don't think I should be lumped together with people who actually drink and drive.

"AITA for refusing to get to know my mom’s new boyfriend?. Background: I am 18 years old and still in high school. My parents divorced last year and I live full time with my mom. Later this year I will be packing my bags and moving out for college.

Anyways, when my parents got divorced last year I definitely took the hardest emotional hit of my parents and 1 brother. It was very hard for me to adjust to life without having my dad in my everyday life.

Yes I have met him and shook his hand and all, but I really have no interest in getting to know him and forming a relationship with him. Therefore pretty much anytime he is at our house, I go and hide out in my room, leave in my car, or whatever etc.

"AITA for yelling at my developmentally disabled classmate?. Throw away just cuz.
I’m (30) in a Special Fx makeup class alongside a fellow student we will call... Billy (20-something). I’m no doctor, but Billy clearly has developmental issues of some sort. The majority of class time he’s sweet and jolly, just generally confused and slower to grasp the material.
Things became tough when I was assigned as his model for a major project. Billy has trouble reading and writing, so he goes into these makeup applications without notes. Unfortunately, the processes we’re doing take 3-4 hours. They involve upwards of 30 steps, several techniques, chemicals, glues, and scissors all around the face. It’s not the kind of thing that should be done from memory after watching one demonstration.
Here I am sitting in Billy’s makeup chair, where he has no idea what he’s doing. Our teacher is hands off and too busy working with all the students to give Billy the 1 on 1 attention he needs. Throughout the process I try to help him the best I can (without my own notes!), but he’s generally frustrated, defensive and combative the whole time. We reached the peak of our interaction when Billy started straight up hurting me. He was NOT purposefully trying to hurt me. I’m just not confident he has the capacity to grasp the material and/or think on his feet. 
I gently but firmly communicated 3-4 times that he needed to change up whatever he was doing because it was painful. He responded the same way he had been the whole time, by arguing and ignoring me. At this point, I got out of the chair, told him to step away, and finished the removal process myself. The conversation then became heated and loud enough for the entire class to hear. Billy was mad I wouldn’t let him finish. He repeatedly interrupted me when I tried to explain why I needed him to stop. Couldn’t get a word out. I finally yelled, “YOU DON’T GET TO INTERRUPT ME WHILE I’M GIVING YOU FEEDBACK ABOUT HURTING ME!” Billy was devastated. He explained he wasn’t trying to hurt me, but he “didn’t know how to fix it” so he just kept going. We reached a place where he’s still defensive, but at least apologetic. I tell Billy I know he didn’t mean to hurt me, and that we can be friends, but he needs to listen better. I’m assigned to continue being his model for this major project. The teacher watched our blowout from afar and did nothing. 
I don’t believe Billy means to behave aggressively, but I’m also not sure my teacher or the school have any plans to give him special attention. I’m not sure how I could have handled the situation better, but I still feel terrible. People with disabilities have every right to chase their dreams and better themselves... but not while haphazardly using instruments and chemicals on my face! AITA?","NTA.

"AITA For not wanting to get a tattoo even though my girlfriend wants me to get one?. So I've been dating my girlfriend for three years now. And I love her I truly do, we're still young, (early 20's) and she would like me to get a tattoo.   
This is really important to her as multiple people in her family have a tattoo that symbolizes their love for a given person. She believes that it is a way to show the world that you're taken or that you're in love with someone, and that you're theirs. She also believes that a tattoo should not have you worry about what others think because a body is a shell and is temporary. Lastly and I think this is what makes it so hard for me to put down my foot is, she would like me to get a tattoo (of any size or design, anywhere on my body) in order to support her getting a tattoo. She isn't necessarily getting the tattoo for me, she wants to get one that represents our love, but also to cover her scars. She has had depression in the past and has cut herself, and she said that she wanted a tattoo that represented our love and her past. As she feels that it is important to her and our relationship to remember but to move on from her past but to also symbolize our love and how far we've come.   
Personally as my own morals I stay away from tattoos, I think they're cool and I don't mind people with tattoos, I think that they're awesome. But deep down inside I really do not want one. never wanted one either. I just don't want one and I love her a lot I just feel that I shouldn't have to have one to prove our love or to support her as I can do that in various different ways. And we argued over it, me saying that I do not want it because I can prove love and support in other ways. And she wants me to have for the reasons listed above.   

Important things to note:

She does not care what size, design, or place I get the tattoo.

She wants a tattoo to show her that I support her as well as show my commitment.

She's not controlling or anything this is just one thing she is very passionate about. So much in fact she would break up with me. 

I personally do not want a tattoo because I do not want one on my body.

I also do not want one because I feel that I can support and love her in various different ways.


So Am I The Asshole for not wanting to get a tattoo for her?

Tl;dr my girlfriend wants me to get a tattoo as it means a lot more to her than it means to me. And I do not want one because I just do not want one nor do I feel you should have to have a tattoo to prove your love for someone.

Edit 1: just added some extra info.","NTA, if you don't want a tattoo that should be the end of the discussion. She'd probably be (rightfully) pissed if you pressured her to get a nose job (or other permanent body modification) she didn't want. It goes both ways.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA For ruining a student film project because they took my idea. Hi, this is a first post for me so sorry if i fuck anything up. 

I'm currently in grade 11 (16 years old) and go to a public school that has a highly regarded theatre and film program. During the summer the film program did a summer camp of what was essentially a shortened version of the fall afterschool student film program and I participated. 

How it works is basically all the people who want to write and direct during the first couple of days do pitches for projects and then afterwards theres voting/ the director getting a crew together. During the summer program I gave a pitch for a comedy film of a guy who gets denied heaven because the secretary is a petty bitch, its one scene, one room, basically very simple. 
The film doesn't get picked but i'm not too pissed because i can always pitch again during the fall, plus I'll get more time to make it. 

The fall rolls around and i miss the first couple of days of the fall program due to doing a Shakespeare camp that went into the first coupke of weeks of school; doesn't really matter i can always pitch for the last day. My first day off of Shakespeare rolls around and i show up, this was a day where we figure out cameras not a pitch day. However, after it ends I'm walking home with a buddy and i mention the idea (that ive told them before) and tell them I'm serious about making it this time and that is when they inform me a boy in the grade 10 year (who was also in the summet program) has already pitched that idea almost word for word and there is rumblings of it probably being picked and getting a crew

This pissed me off, it pissed me off even more when I tell the film teacher (whom i told the idea to in late may) she said that even if I'm right (and she knows i was), she can't do much since it already has a crew and i need to get used to it ""cause that happens a lot."" 

I start getting basically and dated anythings that relates to my idea being originally bought up in late april, aswell as hand written accounts from parents and friends saying how much ive talked about this idea and start roaming the hallways telling people about how this kid has stolen my idea (btw this is what I did last week) and start posting receipts about it on social media.
Because if this all the junior kids who were working on this started getting harrased by other students online for stealing my idea and they decided to disband.

However a lot of people have come up and talked to me about how this was jealous and petty behavior and how I'm probably just trying too stop new kids from joining the film program so it remains a clique thing and how I'm denying a kid from making something great.
Now I'm very worried and confused so that's why im turning to you guys at reddit for help.

(EDIT: oop I should've mentioned in original post but i did have a partial script finished during the summer program which i made the first pitch, by the fall i had a partial second draft done. I haven't seen the kids first draft yet so I can't say if he copied any joke ideas)","NTA

Plagiarism is a thing and if, as you describe it, this kid pitched YOUR idea ""almost word for word"" then I'm glad you made a big deal of it. It's NOT okay. If this kid gets away with this, then this is teaching EVERYONE a bad lesson. He could not get away with this in the adult professional world. Everyone needs to understand this.

Just because some people are upset because you've dared to speak up for yourself doesn't mean you are wrong. Who cares if it ""happens a lot""? (As the teacher admitted.) It sucks. It stinks. I'm glad you stood up to it.

Edit: This quote especially infuriates me:

>However a lot of people have come up and talked to me about how this was jealous and petty behavior and how I'm probably just trying too stop new kids from joining the film program so it remains a clique thing and how I'm denying a kid from making something great.

""Denying a kid from making something great""? It's NOT his to make. It's not a coincidence that he pitched the idea word for word. I'd feel different if he came along with a similar idea by chance (because a lot of similar ideas are floating out there) and just happened to get to it before you did. But if it's word for word a copy of YOUR idea (and he got it from hearing your pitch) then he has no right and he's being a no-talent by stealing. There's nothing ""great"" about stealing someone's idea so blatantly. These people are trying to enable his plagiarism. That would never be tolerated in the real world.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for sharing food that was given to me as a birthday gift?. It was my birthday today and my friends threw me a surprise party, which was really sweet of them. They all gave me gifts and one of them gave me a big box of chocolates. The thing is, I'm on a super strict no processed sugar diet right now because I've been training for a series of bike races so I want to be in top condition. All of them knew this beforehand and they even went so far as to not getting me a cake, but instead cooking me other really healthy foods (again, really sweet of them). After opening the box of chocolates, I knew I couldn't indulge too much so I just had a small piece and then said ""hey guys, you can have some too! These are fantastic!"" and basically didn't eat a single other piece and left the rest of the chocolates for my friends to eat. 

Near the end of the party, the person who bought me the chocolates said they were hurt that I didn't eat that many chocolates and that I gave away her present. She said that she had bought them for me and not for the rest of my friends. I told her I really appreciated the gift and then also reminded her of the diet and how much the bike races meant for me (since biking was what had basically saved me from my anxiety and other bad unhealthy habits). I further explained that I had even broken my diet for the first time in 4 months to have a piece. I also said that since it was my gift, I felt I should be able to share it with others if I want. She didn't see it that way and left feeling both sad and mad.

"AITA in the laundry room?. Earlier today I was doing laundry in the laundry room in my apartment building. There are four washers and four dryers. However, two of the dryers were broken. 

When I arrived, three of the washers were already in use, mid-cycle. Probably 5-10 minutes ahead of me. I loaded up the other washer and went about my way.

The problem was that the laundry room was closing soon. Knowing this, I made sure that I was down there the second my laundry was done, and moved it to one of the dryers, and used it until the laundry room was closed.

The issue is that this meant that the people who started their laundry ahead of me were unable to dry all of their clothes, because there was only 1 dryer for 3 washers and there wasn't time to do more than one load before the room closed.

"AITA For giving up on a close friend?. So it sounds dumb and corny but hear me out—

&#x200B;

So this is gonna involve 2 other people, let's call them Chris and Brandon.

&#x200B;

I met this Chris my freshman year of high-school. He already knew Brandon, who was a very close friend of mine, and we hit it off immediately. He was the only person who stuck by me after the shit hit the fan for me that year, and he stayed since. We were basically brothers by the time junior year hits, and I get kicked out of school (apparently it's not okay to bring weed to school but whatever) and we both still stick by each other. We shared everything with each other and did everything together. Hell, we even lost our v's to the same lady (a story for another time).

When Chris got his license, we went on trips together all the time even if Brandon wouldn't go. Chris and I could just talk for hours and hours without stopping. We could do virtually anything anywhere and still have a good time.

We've been arrested together (nothing major, just dumb teen stuff) and have really experienced a lot of life together generally.

&#x200B;

Around his senior year (I got my GED so I was out already) he started getting more into psychedelics. We smoked weed a lot before then, but never wanted to experiment with psychs. He tried acid, and mushrooms fairly frequently but never to an extent that would concern me. Brandon and I did acid with him just once, as well as mushrooms and mushroom tea on multiple occasions. Finally, me and Brandon decided we experienced what we wanted to, so we were good and done with psychs for a long while. Chris didn't feel the same.

He continued to fry as much as he possibly could. His eyes turned into black holes, and he looked like he had goddamn tuberculosis 24/7. I expressed my worry to him on many occasions, as well as Brandon. We did our best to get him to calm down, but whenever we approached him about it, he'd get extremely defensive.

&#x200B;

Finally, he had enough of us and ghosted us for a year. We were extremely fed up with him, and had no problem with him doing this, but continued to worry about him. We'd see him around sometimes, and be relieved he's at least still alive.

&#x200B;

A bit later on he contacted us again (I should add the three of us were in a band) to see about jamming. We were all for it, and he seemed like he matured a bit and kinda got his head in the right place. We set a date, and he came on over.

&#x200B;

We jammed for a couple minutes and he continued asking if we wanted to drop acid with him. We declined over and over again, and he got fed up and left.

&#x200B;

Blah blah blah he ghosted us again, then he was back.

After he contacted us the last time, he announced he's having a son with someone he had a one-night-stand with. I hoped this would urge him to become more mature and get his shit together, but of course not. He became super into painkillers and pills in general. A couple of weeks ago, he swallowed a handful of Valium and downed an entire bottle of Smirnoff. He was in the hospital for two days and almost died. He claimed he was ""just tryna get fucked up"". **He has a goddamn son.** 

A couple days ago Brandon and I were kicking it as we do every Monday to catch the new episode of Arrow. He messaged us, asking what we were up to. I told him, and he got pissed off and ghosted us again. We decided we had enough. No use worrying about him, we already grieved him long ago.

"AITA for being more concerned about my health than my hygiene, and that my dad took so long to get the meds I needed?. Last night I had to go to the hospital for extreme pain in my right side, which made me vomit several times and yell/cry in pain. After two blood draws, a urine sample, an IV full of fluid, some antibiotics and a CT scan, it turns out I have a UTI in my right kidney on top of a 4 millimeter kidney stone. I was able to go home but was instructed to take prescription antibiotics 3x a day as well as drink plenty of water, and a strainer for the kidney stone if I pass it. I went to sleep around 2 am or so.

I am 18 (F) w/ autism and I cannot drive to get this prescription myself as I have no driver’s license, nor do I have an ID.

Wake up, 8 am. I lay in bed for a while on my phone. Dad gets up around 10 am and I ask when he will go pick up my antibiotics. He says “soon.” I take a nap around this time and wake up at around 1:00 PM.

I walk out into the living room. He’s cuddling my mom, watching TV. I ask him (in a admittedly annoyed/pissed off tone) when he’s going to get my antibiotics. My mom then proceeds to yell at me about how my dad isn’t going to run around for me like some minion, that I’ll probably just end up taking the meds 2x today since I just “sleep all the time”, and that I need a shower since I haven’t showered in a few days (I know that is bad, I’m working on taking showers more often.)

"AITA for swearing angrily at a guy right to his face after his dog ran out of his yard and attacked my wife walking our dog?. So it happened this morning, and I feel pretty guilty about loosing my sh*t at the guy, I’m usually calm in most situations and have been attacked by two dogs myself a few years ago and didn’t go off at the owners, while at a dog park with my GSD, who is pretty placid. 

We were walking along the street like we do every morning , my wife and I walk to the bus stop for me to go to work. 

As were were waking two boxer dogs ran out from a yard (side gate apparently) and ran towards us, one back paddled and the other body slammed our GSD and my wife, she had the lead of our dog. I moved in to stop the dog, but it started lunging and biting my dog things escalated pretty quickly. 

I kicked the dog off my wife a few times and it kept coming back (our GSD didn’t retaliate which was good/lucky) few moments later of snarling, lunging and biting  the guy ran up and got his dog as it circled for another pass. 

I walked up to his face and said “are you fu*king kidding me, letting your dog off the lead like that, fu*k sakes” he said “they got out the gate.” My wife said “sorry (for me) it’s the shock”.  That I reacted like that.

"WIBTA for not accommodating one staff member over the rest of my staff?. Long story short, every year I take my staff (about ten people) out to this very nice Italian restaurant that everyone in my office absolutely loves. Its a highlight of our December as an office and everyone always looks forward to it. We have been doing it there consistently for about 7-10 years I would say. People have been asking when the lunch party will be in anticipation of it.

I just made the reservation on Monday to have lunch there in a couple weeks. I also just hired a new staff member about a month ago. I sent out the email this morning letting everyone now the date and time I booked the lunch. I received in reply from most my staff that they are excited and looking forward to it. The new staff member, however, also just emailed asking if there were any Plant-based food options there. I am not really sure if they do, but sent her the menu and said if we need to choose another place that accommodates that, we can. Then she just told me that not only does she only eat plant-based food, but also cannot eat in a place that serves pork at all (first time I am made aware she has any food restrictions at all). Maybe I am being very ignorant, but I am not sure thee are too many places in my area that serves zero pork. Now I don't want to be rude to this staff member and make her feel left out, especially because she is new, which is why I have no problem finding an alternative that serves plant-based food, but I am feeling conflicted about finding a place that serves primarily plant based options and no pork. Everyone else in my office eats the standard american diet with little restrictions (Think high fat and high carb content lol). I already know with some of my more porkster (pun intended) employees will be upset about this and probably bitch. But I don't want to leave this one staff member out, but also feel bad prioritizing her food restrictions over everyone else's preferences. I am going to see if I can find a place with plant based food options and no pork served there, but if I can't find one that most people would be okay with, WIBTA if I kept the reservation at the current place (I know for a fact it serves pork so this would not work for the new staff member). I can see a couple of my employees not wanting to go or refusing to go to a plant-based no pork restaurant because they would not like anything there. So do I prioritize the new member of my staff over the others or essentially prioritize the older staff members over the new one?

&#x200B;

Edit: To clear up some confusion, she in general is a nice lady and is seeming to be doing well in her position. She did not demand anything, and even said if it ends up being at a place that cooks pork, then she wouldn't come. The difficulty with that, is I dont want to alienate her or make her feel bad especially because she is new and is will likely do good work for us, which is really hard to come by.  If she did not come, she would be the only one in the office for like 2/2.5 hours while everyone is having fun at lunch. I would offer her to go home for that time period but she lives like 45 min to an hour away with snow conditions so that wouldn't make sense for her. Hence my current dilemma.

Edit#2: A lot of people are asking similar questions so I figured an update would be easier. Anyways, I spoke with her again and broke everything down. I tried to flesh out the pork thing but, without her being mean or rude, she essentially just left it as a religious thing and would not go into more detail, and I did not want to press more. So I told her it was important to me she felt included and a part of the team. I told her to find me some alternatives by the end of the week so I can at least explore those, and see about getting a plate brought to the restaurant. May explore a gift card idea if that does not work.

Thank you to those who actually have compassion and understanding that not everyone is the same and some people have religious/allergy restrictions. Also, a lot of you need to work on your reading comprehension. A lot of the comments make it seem like the first two sentences were read and that's it.

Edit#3: Apparently this still needs to be clarified. She has the issue with pork because of her religion. Its not ""I don't like pork, thus no one can have it either."" Its more like ""my religion does not allow pork to be cross contaminated with other foods items, so if pork is cooked in the kitchen I cannot eat there.""

"AITA for telling my Bosses that a colleague saw another colleague stealing food from work?. So last year I volunteered at an elementary school in my town for a few months. I had a little group of other volunteers that I worked together with. We used to help out in the Kitchen, organised and played with the Children usually.

after a few months, we got a new volunteer in our group. Let's just call her Jane, to make this easier (Not her real name). So Jane seemed pretty nice, and she was a good help in her first few weeks. After a while my Bosses noticed, that food had gone missing, since Jane began working with us. This incident began repeating and it was always the same.

Food vanished, we got suspected, we said we didn't take it, our bosses didn't believe us and the their trust kept shrinking.

But then one morning a colleague of mine saw jane at the fridge, taking and eating some of the food, that we usually prepare for the Kids to eat for lunch. She told the other volunteers, including me, but didn't want to tell our bosses because she was scared of getting in a conflict.

As most of you already expected by the title, that was what I ended up doing for her. And no, I didn't go to My Bosses and said ""Jane stole the food, I saw it."", since I was unable to prove it. I said ""a colleague, that want's to remain anonymous gave me a tip that he/she saw Jane taking some of the food from the fridge.

So it might be understandable, that I was pretty annoyed by her and the way she treated us as her colleagues.

Now it is important to know, that if you do volunteer work in Germany under specific circumstances, you get a Paper, which you can show when applying for job and add to your CV.

I wanted them to maybe seriously talk to her or give her a proper punishment, once they could prove her guiltiness. But now it's very likely, that she will get kicked out or even worse.

"AITA for not wanting to go to my brother's destination wedding?. My brother and his girlfriend have been engaged for the last 5 years, with no talks of ever actually getting married during that time (before their engagement, they had been dating for less than 10 months when he got her pregnant, and he gave her a ring two weeks before the baby was born because of pressure from our parents, and her parents). They have never referred to each other as fiance/fiancee. These two are frivolous with whatever little money they have, but they spend as if they're rich, and then complain when they have no money. They go on vacation every year with their kid to Dominican Republic, they each bought new cars recently (my brother asked me to co-sign because he couldn't get a loan on his own, and I refused), they bought a town house 2 years ago and have a mortgage that they can't afford, they are constantly buying whatever the newest must-have sneakers are in matching pairs (like air jordans), etc....

"AITA for planning on withholding my brother's video game?. Here's some backstory: 

A couple months back I bought an XBOX 360 controller since our other ones are kind of crappy. I bought it for $30. The controller worked fine, however, I instructed my brothers that under no circumstances are they to use this without my permission (because they are known to leave things around/break them).

Lo and behold, I find one using the controller without my consent. Because I wasn't particularly pissy that day, I told him he could continue to use it ***in the event he puts it back unharmed.*** He doesn't put it back, but instead puts it in a precarious spot where it can fall. I tell him to move it, but he refuses.

Later on, he ends up dropping and breaking the controller (he technically broke the mechanism that connects the right trigger to the circuit, which renders RT unusable. Therefore, the whole thing is useless because RT is so universaly used). I inform him of this, and tell him he can get me a new controller or reimburse me for my purchase. While normally I wouldn't care, this particular controller was the only one that worked with the computer, so I cannot play games that require a controller now (emulators).

----

Fast forward to now: my brother announces that he is planning to buy a new hunting game (with what funds, I don't know, since he doesn't have a job and has been known to take money). I tell him that he must get me a new controller before proceeding with the purchase. He at first dodges it, claiming the controller isn't mine, then that he didn't brake it (even though I have a witness), followed by his flat-out refusal to purchase it. 

Now I am planning to take his new game and withhold it from him until he reimburses me for the controller he broke. I have given him multiple warnings, and he had ignored all of them. Does that make me an asshole? 

P.S. I have more than enough money to purchase a new controller. This is more about his refusal to repay me and his ignorance than it is my care for a new controller.

**TL;DR** - My brother owes me money for something of mine he broke. He is planning to buy something, and I plan to take it from him until he brings me my money or a replacement.
","I don't think you're the asshole, but just arbitrarily taking something of his kind of crosses a line. You're not a bank, you don't get to repossess because you perceive a debt to you. Although you're right that rightfully he does owe you money.

It just seems like if you decide to take something of his because he owes you something else, rather than getting what you want, you're probably going to start an escalating war of ""if he's going to do that then I'm going to do this"".   

As it stands, your brother is obviously the asshole. He has no respect for other people's things and he's apparently a liar.  Someone should make him pay, but if you make him pay, you're just going to start a cycle of vengeance.   If this were the adult world and the grievance were not petty you would take him to court and sue him and most likely somebody would make him pay.    But that option doesn't exist here. Certainly you could complain to your parents but that would make you the bitch if not the asshole. Although it would be kind of funny if your parents would do a mock court room scene where you can both plead your case and they decide if the plaintiff gets $30 to buy a new controller.",0,0,0,0,1
"WIBTA If I tell my best friend to forget about his girlfriend?. So I moved halfway across the country about 4 months ago with who is now my wife. When we lived in the midwest, we were both very close to my friend Steve. Steve is one of my best friends and he was even a groomsman in my wedding. If it helps, Steve is 24 and a very accomplished engineer.  


Backstory: Steve had a female friend named Marcy (23) that he's known for 8 years. They both came to a point 1.5 years ago where Marcy proclaimed her love to him. They started a relationship together that was great for 3-4 months. Steve and Marcy live in different states 8 hours away from each other. My wife and I met her about 3 months into the relationship and we saw some red flags right off the bat. She is an awful drunk. Whenever she drinks, she finds seemingly random reasons to get angry with Steve. She often walks away from him in a fit of rage, goes and sits outside of a bar/person's house, and cries until someone tries to console her.   


Steve has also broken up with Marcy 3 times now. One time included her actively cutting herself in front him. He actually called an ambulance twice in one night because of her doing this. Marcy's religion also disallows her from dating Steve as Steve is white, and Marcy is middle eastern.  


Fast forward to my recent wedding. He was a groomsman, so he understandably was less available than she wanted him to be. This put a strain on some stuff as people felt like they needed to ""entertain"" her. My brother's SO reluctantly invited her to her house to get ready and she made awful comments about me the whole time. She wasn't happy Steve was off taking pictures for the wedding when she was left on her own.  


The area where the wedding was is an area that Steve and Marcy have never been to before. Since Steve was an accomplished engineer, he had interest in seeing this area as there is a company with opportunity for him that he would be interested in. My parents are supervisors for this company and have told him on numerous occasions that if he applied to the company, he would be given a job due to his credentials and experience. So he expressed interest and his girlfriend lost it. She was sobbing in the driveway of where the wedding reception was. Steve spent the majority of the night trying to calm her down while also trying to have a good time at the reception. She resorted to drinking heavily to deal with this, as did Steve. Since they were fighting, my family tried to help them out and just get them both to a point where they could just enjoy their time there so that way my wife and I didn't have to deal with it at our wedding. Everyone in my family that met him and her kept saying he's so nice, and she's awful for/to him.   


He is planning on applying to the company, but he keeps saying, ""I'll have to see where Marcy can finish school around there and if she'd be interested in any schools near there.""

"AITA for getting upset with my wife in public because she let my kids get close to an alligator?. My wife and I have been together for fifteen years, and we have a good relationship. Camping, primarily in the southeast, has always been a big part of us, and bringing our children into camping and the outdoors has been the best.

But I had a big wtf moment with my wife. We took the kids to a swamp where you can get in a boat and see alligators. There are also just some wild alligators around the property just like chilling. When leaving the little museum, there was a 5-foot alligator outside. My wife told the kids to come with her to see it. She took the kids over to it about 15 ft away. I grew up with the notion that you respect wildlife and you stay the fuck away from things that can be dangerous. My wife and I have always shaken our heads in disbelief at people who get out to take pictures of the bears in the smokies.

I started freaking out because I felt like my kids were in danger. I asked her to bring them back, and she shrugged it off and said they were fine. Then I told her to bring them away from it. Then some people at the swamp that were walking around started telling me that the gator won’t attack them and they grew up around them just fine. I started getting angry telling her to bring the damn kids away from the alligator.

Eventually she did, but I was super pissed for the rest of the day. I don’t know if it’s pride, but she still maintains I overreacted and even everyone there thought I was. It still makes me mad as I felt like my kids were needlessly in danger and makes me even madder that she didn’t at least come back for my sake.

I can definitely understand why you wanted to express your concerns as good sized alligators like the one you described can be dangerous. After reading your post I did some research to see what a safe observation range would be and I found a CBS article suggesting that you should be at least 40ft away from a gator as they are capable of lunging themselves as far as around 20ft when striking. That being said I have heard that American Alligators are a lot more mild tempered than most other crocodilians and are less likely to attack unless provoked so if you ever see one laying around you wouldn’t necessarily have to book it to a safe position right away. All said I do agree that your family should have given it more space as attack do happen but I wouldn’t raise my voice bc of it as not only would that make a scene but if could as disturb the gator and cause it to behave more defensively.

"AITA for asking my housemates not always be in the common space?. After my housemate told me about this thread [“ATIA for always spending time in the common space in a house with room mates?”!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/76149k/aita_for_always_spending_time_in_the_common_space/) I thought I’d give my perspective and see what the response was. 

My two roommates and I talked with our housemate couple about how we would prefer it if they were not constantly in the common space. One or both of them is typically in the (quite small) common area, and some weeks they will both be out of the house for maybe five hours total. We understand they work from home and want to relax in the common area, but nearly 24/7 is beyond our idea of normal. It's important to note that our walls are also paper thin so you can hear almost anything between the three bedrooms. My girlfriend and I are in one room and the couple is in the middle one. You can easily hear conversations between the middle bedroom and the other two, and the bedrooms also open to the common space so noise easily passes between those areas as well. 

I think part of the misunderstanding lies in this sentence, “They assured us that it wasn't because we were doing anything particularly annoying in the common space, just that we were there so often.” What we had tried to convey was that, hypothetically, if they were in the common space 24/7 and not doing anything annoying we would still not find that ideal. We do stay in our rooms if we want to be alone, but would occasionally like to be able to cook, eat at the table, or just leave our rooms without having to engage with someone. It would also be nice to be able to be in our rooms without someone being able to hear us at all times. 

However, this hypothetical is not the reality. The couple is there often and they fight with each other, argue, or generally create unpleasantness fairly frequently (mostly the wife).  Sometimes we hear this between the rooms when, for instance, she calls him stupid or useless and makes him cry. Other times it’s in the common area , where it’s usually about something more trivial but also fairly uncomfortable. This situation came to a head because they were arguing in the common space and I asked the wife if she could stop arguing/not be so loud. She became quite angry over this and let me have it. One thing led to another and we all got together to talk about how it would be better for us if they could get out more and also not do this stuff in the house.

I feel that it’s reasonable to expect someone to reflect on this behavior and whether it would bother someone. It’s obvious we have some different preferences - for instance, when I realized they were clipping their nails on the living room/kitchen table and cleaning them off with our dish sponge they agreed to refrain but were somewhat perplexed as to why I found it gross. I wouldn’t say this makes them assholes, but is a similar case where I’d wager these preferences are outside the norm and therefore it's a good idea to reflect on if it would bother someone. 

I probably wrote too much but tried to add details I thought were important and to clarify my understanding of the situation. Are we (22-26) young punks making unjustified or immature demands of them (29M and 33F)?  Does it seem reasonable to request some free time in the common space and that most people would agree with this? Am I the asshole?",I think that they are kind of assholes. Fighting in their room is fine because they can’t really control how thin the walls are but fighting in the common area sucks for everyone involved. You guys shouldn’t have to be part of that. Also I think that them being home and around each other so much might be part of the problem. But that’s neither here nor there. ,0,0,0,0,1

My dad and I were pulling into a handicapped parking stall on Saturday (dad has polyneuropathy) in a busy Safeway parking lot. We were about halfway into the stall when the older couple in the stall exactly opposite of us started pulling into the stall (instead of backing out) we were trying to park in. My dad and I were confused, wondering WTF this guy was doing, so dad backed up. Old guy pulled through our stall and then we pulled back in.

"WIBTA for interfering in professor's lecture when he starts telling offensive jokes?. UPD: This is in Russia, not in the USA. Laws, their interpretation, and morality here are a bit different, otherwise such situation probably wouldn't occur in the first place. Therefore, please keep in mind that legal issues you notice might be not applicable.

\*\*\*

One of our college professors, among others, likes to joke when lecturing. Unfortunately, some of his jokes are quite disrespectful (i.e. ""Ultrasound is emitted by women who get their whims denied"") - and, unlike other joke types, these also don't bring anything useful to the lecture. I've tried telling him about it several times but he dismissed my concerns with indifferent ""Uh-huh, sure, of course it's not funny"" and, clearly, it did no impact.

I can't skip his course or just be absent because, while not really important, it's still mandatory and he requires us to show notes of his lectures for a grade.  
I don't think bringing this up to faculty leaders will result in any effect because telling such jokes isn't a crime or something, so why would they bother.  
I can, technically, suck it up with ""ah, this guy's just a prick"" - but while I want to have a good grade like any student, I would still also like it very much if professors didn't belittle others, including myself, in the process of teaching, no matter how petty their insults are.

So, I want to get more vocal, maybe even mirror the joke as last resort, in trying to signal him the message or at least get it off my chest (nevermind the *quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi*) when he says something like that again.

Brief back story, was together with my ex for 7 years, condo, dogs, the whole 9 yards. Seemingly out of the blue the ex decided she needed space to find herself. While crushed I understood that we had not been very happy together. 

I told her I would move out into my friends while I shopped around for an apartment. Most of our belongings are mine, TV bed, furniture, cookware, etc.  I told her I would be back to collect them once I had a new place.  Another reason I decided to leave is that we were informally renting the home from her sister.

While staying at my friends I was able to confirm my suspicions that she had been unfaithful. (I can go into detail on the investigation but would rather not relieve that). I also found that she had linked her Venmo account to our joint savings several weeks back and had been purchasing about $180/week of Cocaine form our drug dealer. Total about $600.

Between the stealing and the infidelity I was livid. So I waited until she was at work and with the help of my friend went back and moved all of my things out.

She was blowing up my phone and I have been called every name in the book. I do feel bad essentially leaving her with an empty home but my reasoning is two fold.

I always believed in honesty and communication in a relationship so I told him frankly that I have zero desire to volunteer. 

I told him that I wouldn't mind donating money to a charity that I like but I do not have the financial means to do so. He suggested volunteering but again I told him I don't have a desire to do so. It quickly devolved into a debate whether money or ground work was more important. I'm of the opinion that both are necessary and equally important, which he found ironic given my unwillingness to volunteer. I tried to remain civil but he was obviously agitated by this revelation.

"AITA for wanting to break up with my fiance because of his violent and destructive son?. I met my fiance 2 years ago and our love is like a fairy tale, everything seemed so perfect. I met his son when he was 5 years old, he's 7 now. His son, who I will call Josh, was very open and warm to me in the beginning. My fiance was never the best at being a dad to him, but when I came in the picture we changed that. I made sure we had meals together when I was around and we went on trips to the zoo and museum frequently. I would make sure they had ""Josh and Dad"" days, and I would often take him out by myself to arcades or the pool. Everything was going well, but I always noticed defiance in Josh. He fights everything. He lies about everything. His mom says he's 100x worse at her house, and I know there is some tension in their home so I expected that.

Josh is very destructive, more than the average 7 year old I believe. I invited my fiance to come live with me after about a year of dating. I have two extra rooms so I figured we could fix one up for Josh. Josh comes over every weekend, and every weekend piece of my furniture is either broken completely or destroyed in some way (colored on, buttons ripped off, holes poked or cut in things). When confronted about these things he will lie and lie even if we caught him in the act. Josh will steal from his friends, from his school, and from us. Josh stole $100 from my purse last week when his dad confronted him he said ""Well, if I can't have it, you can't either!"" And ripped the bill in half.

Josh is violent, I have had to put all his play guns/swords too high for him to reach because when he has them he shoots people in the face or beats them with his swords. We had my grandparents over for dinner one time and he managed to get his guns and shoot them in the face during dinner. He is often screaming that he wants to kill things. My dog is currently staying at my mother's because when Josh comes over he will lock the dog in the bathroom or outside for hours on end. Josh would chase my dog with big sticks and everytime he walked in the door my (usually very friendly) dog would run away or pee. 

My fiance and I recently found out I was pregnant. Josh acted out tremendously when he was told. I ended up losing the baby 3 months in and Josh was so happy about this... Often telling me ""I'm glad the baby died. I don't want any siblings."" Or ""It's good that your body can't make babies right. I hate babies."" This was basically the breaking point for me. We have tried tough love, open arms, therapy, all of it. Nothing seems to change or get through to this boy. I understand he's 7 and coming from a broken home is always damaging. But, at the end of the day he's not biologically mine and I have been feeling more and more disconnected and really feel no love for him at this point. Not only is it unfair for me, but it's unfair for my fiance AND his son. It's exhausting and fills me with anxiety whenever my husband leaves to pick him up. I feel like I hold my breath all weekend. 

I would never make ANYONE choose between their child and their SO. And even if I did, I would be disappointed if someone chose their SO over their kid. I think I need to leave, I don't think I have the emotional capacity to stay and deal with it. I want nice things again, I want my dog, I want to have kids someday. AITA?","NTA.

It sounds like the kid has ODD or something along those lines.  Regardless of why he is the way he is, it's clear that it's going to take constant, proactive effort to help him grow into a functional member of society (not to mention keep him out of jail).  I get that you love your fiance, and probably the kid too, but you're under no obligation to remain in their lives if it's too much for you to handle. ",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for leaving my son on a bench outside. My oldest son (19) brought his girlfriend to our town to meet us and we were meeting at a local restaurant. My younger son (16) is going through his teenager phase and was grumpy while we were waiting for our table. He told me that he was embarrassed to be seen with me because of my outfit and he went to sit on a bench a few feet away. 

When our table got called, I called my son's name several times, and he didn't look up. He was only 6 feet away or so so I thought he was ignoring me, so we just went inside and I figured he'd come in when he felt like it. He came into the restaurant about 15 minutes later and he was angry that we didn't tell him we were going in. When I explained that I thought he was ignoring me, he told me I should've come right up to him and pointed out that I wouldn't leave my daughter outside. However, my daughter is 4 and that's obviously different since my son is 16 and has some common sense and a cell phone. He sulked for the rest of the meal.

I feel a little bad for leaving him outside only because of the argument and sulking it caused since my other son told me that it was awkward for his girlfriend. On the other hand, I don't feel like I did anything terribly wrong. Am I the asshole for creating a situation where there didn't need to necessarily be one?","NTA.

"AITA for making my boyfriend’s friend pay for something that costs me nothing extra?. I’ve been planning to take a fun trip with my boyfriend for a few months. It’s to a location that is highly touristy, but has a lot of sentimental value to me because my family took the trip when I was a kid.

I wanted to do the whole experience and stay at the iconic luxury hotel there as kind of a treat. It’s only a long weekend, but will cost a couple thousand dollars. My boyfriend’s also happy to go to this place, but since it’s really something I’ve really been pushing (and he’d be fine with a less expensive hotel), I offered to pay the cost of the hotel (we’ll split the other costs).

I happened to mention it to my sister as I was getting ready to book, and she indicated that she would really like to come. As it turns out, my boyfriend’s sister is also really dying to go. But neither can afford the hotel I picked out. The room I was going to get can technically fit 4, so I said they could just stay with us and I’d still cover the whole thing.

Well, due to some bad luck (an injury for one and a shitty work situation for the other) neither one is now able to make it. My boyfriend has asked if his friend (and his friend’s new girlfriend) can join us instead.

Here’s the thing: I don’t like this particular friend. He drinks a ton, does drugs, and is someone I wouldn’t 100% trust not to mess up a hotel room.

So I told him that his friend could come, but if he wants to stay in the room, he and his girlfriend will have to split the cost. My boyfriend told me his friend can’t afford that and asked why I’d charge him when I wasn’t paying anything extra for the room and had already been willing to let our respective sisters stay for free. I told him I was willing to do that for family, but his friend either has to pay or get his own room elsewhere. My boyfriend is pissed and thinks I’m being a bit of an asshole, since it will literally cost me nothing more than what I’m already paying to allow his friend to stay with us. AITA?",NTA.

"AITA for trying to avoid being with a friend.. For context I'm 16. Like most classes, throughout the world, during high school, ours is divided in smaller groups. Since last year this ""friend"", I will call him Max (not real name), he has been manipulative and annoying. 

As I mentioned my class was divided in groups, and ours was the smallest, it consisted of me, Max, and two other friends, I'll call them Omar and Andrew (again not real names). Max was physically abusive for the five years that I hanged out with him, mostly with me, punching and kicking me. I never really gave it much thought since I barely got hurt, and just tolerated it and took it as a joke. Fast forward to February of last year. I started dating a girl, and he got increasingly jealous, started to insult me and my girlfriend, and became closer ""friends"" with Andrew. Although he wasn't as physically abusive with Andrew he did insult him a lot. 

A few months later, during art class, Max got annoyed with Andrew and decided to hit him across the face. As I've heard they had a bit of an argument for a couple of days prior to that. I tried not support either party, but ended up helping Max out a bit because I knew him for longer than Andrew. Until the end of the last school year things got worse and the group started splitting up. 

When this school year started we were now in different classes, and it was just me, Andrew and Donald (yet again not real name, also he already knew Max and Andrew but not me) hanging out and Max came along most of the time. By now neither me nor Andrew can tolerate Max, and so we started to avoid Max. Max noticed something weird and Donald told him that me and Andrew were avoiding him. Max got mad and confronted Andrew, accusing him of being to blame for all of this. 

Andrew is a way better friend than Max, being supportive and never insulted me (except for jokes that I play along with).

I I've know Max for years and feel a bit bad in cutting relations with him, because I know that he is abusive because of a lot of problems he has with parents etc..

"AITA for not wanting to do unpaid work?. So, I'm a student piano teacher working on getting my full teaching certificate. I work out of my piano teacher's studio, and only have a few students of my own. My boss/teacher is pretty nice, but she's pretty technologically lacking, so she asks me to do a lot of ""tech"" stuff like formatting recital brochures and the like. It's not paid work, with her excuse being she doesn't get paid for it either and when I open my own studio I won't be charging for this either. I still do it anyways since she's given me a lot of chances in other areas and I feel like I owe her.

Now for the issue: a competition is coming up and we had to sign up all the students by filling out pretty specific forms online. I did this for her last year and it's not a fun thing to do, especially for no pay. I noticed this year's deadline was coming up and I mentioned it to her, asking her whether she still wanted me to fill out the forms for her this year. She said she'd like me to, but she didn't ask because she got the impression that I didn't want to do it. I replied that of course I didn't want to do it, it isn't fun, but it's part of the job so I'll still do it for you.

Apparently this was the wrong response as she got pissy and said I should be happy to be doing this for her. We had a short argument and now weeks later, she's done it all herself and didn't ask me.

"AITAH for causing a school wide anger over an event?. Hear me out, my school has had a male beauty pageant for the last 20 years. It’s the last senior fundraiser of the year, and about 12 senior guys will go out for it and it’s a super fun, hilarious event. I’m a female, and at the beginning of this school year I decided I was going to be the next “Mr.(school name)” I thought it would be funny, I’m the class clown, I’m a varsity athlete, and I’m pretty well liked, I thought it would be ok. 

I was very wrong. Instead of keeping the pageant name “Mr.(school name)” they renamed it to “Next Top Wolf” (our mascot) in order to be more gender inclusive. This already pissed people off. Then to make matters worse, I was the only female who signed up and performed. There were 7 people total, that’s way lower than previous years. Only 30 people showed up to the event, that’s extremely low considering we are a 4A high school with 2400 kids. During the formal wear portion, nobody clapped for me. I got a few boos. Only the guys on stage and my few female friends in the audience cheered me on. During the voting portion at the end, my male competitors gave me all their voting tickets, this pushed me ahead, and they let me win the whole event! I was pretty happy, the guys were happy, and ASB was happy because their first year of including girls and a girl won. The people who weren’t happy though, was the student body. Protests over social media, calling me a man, making transphobic comments (not towards me just in general about including women in the event) 
Before I signed up, I thought the upset would’ve been funny and minimal, but, I was wrong, and now I ruined the sales for ASB from this event. Should I feel bad? Should I have just sat back and not signed up?","I’d probably say NTA. It wasn’t your fault how the school made changes and for the lack of sign ups, but I maybe would have tried to host or something instead of entering the pageant.

"AITA For not taking down social media posts?. So recently, a friend and I had a falling out that ended pretty badly. A couple weeks later she contacts me and asks me to take down any posts on my instagram that include her. At first, I just untagged her from the photos so she would not have to be associated with me. I didn't want to delete them because they are group photos that include several of my friends. She asked again a couple days later, so I archived the post.

She then texted again asking me to remove other posts that relate to her. To clarify, I took down the post where she was in the first picture (the one you see when looking at my feed), but she is in a couple of posts that have multiple pictures (in the ones that come after the main one). These are not seen from simply viewing my page. I don't understand the problem because these posts contain other people too and no one is going to see them unless they want to go back to posts from 2-3 years ago and swipe through all the pictures. (Again, she is untagged already so she should have no link to the photos unless she is stalking my insta)

Moreover, she asked me to take down a picture of myself, just because it was taken by her in her home. (she is not in the photo) This seemed very unreasonable to me. I grew irritated and removed her as a follower to prevent her from seeing my feed. But then, she texted a mutual friend that I am very close to and asked her to talk to me about removing the pictures. Am I the asshole for keeping them up?

"WIBTA if i refuse to pay the late fee on a shared bill?. I’m (23f) student, i have two jobs in hospitality and study full time. I’m currently sharing with two friends who are a couple. One of them Taylor (not real name) 22f works full time office job is in charge of the bills and rent. Now we’ve talked before about her having that responsibility, and I’ve offered before to put some of the bills in my name. (we did end up transferring one account to me, so to get a student concession, starting next month). Each month she messages the group chat sometimes with a screenshot of the portion of the bill with the amount due, and sometimes she just states the total amount, and we transfer to the rent account ( a bank account in her name, that i dont have access to) for her to pay. 

I always transfer usually within around 3 days of her messaging, very often on the same day. I'm not 100% sure on this but typically you have around 2-3 weeks after receiving the bill to settle the account. This month (I cant find the original message about how much and when electricity was due) according to my bank statement, I transferred my portion around 3 weeks ago. The bill was due last wednesday. This morning, (monday) i get a message from her saying something along the lines of “im so sorry, i didn’t get paid in time to pay the electricity bill so its now $125 more. Can you each transfer me another $43, sorry”

Obviously generally I have no intention of skipping out without paying my share, except that I did pay my share. This isn’t even the first time this has happened. Early on in our living together, she without consulting us, applied for an extension to the internet bill and we each had to pay a bit more. It wasn’t much that time maybe $7, but i was annoyed because had she asked me, i would have lent the money to pay on time. This time, its considerably more money, and again, had she talked to me last week I could have helped her out.

"AITA for offering my neighbor a dessert her kid cannot eat?. I got a bottle of rum left from New Year party and I'm not a drinker, so I decided to make a dessert called envinado that is kind of like a cake but it's drenched in a syrope made of sugar, rum and fruits.

I decided to give some to my neighbors. One of my neighbors is a young woman around my age (I'm also a girl) and she has a 4 years old kid. So she opened the door with her kid and as soon as he saw the envinado the kid started crying about wanting cake. I explained to the mom that it was not cake, it was envinado and it had a lot of rum so her kid couldnt eat it.

She got mad at me and rudely told me that I should have brought something that her kid couldn't eat because now she'll have to deal with a screaming kid all afternoon.

When that just happened I was convinced I did nothing wrong so I posted a rant here on Reddit on another sub (that was later delete because I was told that it didn't fit the sub). But before it was deleted I had like 18 comments and like 15 of those were telling me it was my fault. That I shouldn't have brought something that her kid couldn't eat and that dealing with screaming kids was the worse.

So now I'm wondering was I the asshole here?

Edit 1: English is hard and I said his when I meant to say her.

Edit 2: I don't think you are understanding how much alcohol there is in the envinado. Going by my grandma's recipe. You bake the cake. You made a syrope with a little water, tons of sugar and fruits. Then you mix the syrope with the bottle of rum. And you drench the cake in the syrope+rum mix. It doesn't have a tiny bit of rum. It's dripping rum+syrope.

Edit 3: Just to clarify, I didn't try to give her the whole envinado. I shared it with several of my neighbors. I didn't showed with a full envinado to her house. It was more like a huge slice. I didn't make the envinado with the intention of giving it to her. I made envinado with the intention of using that bottle of rum for something tasty and then I decided to share it with my neighbors.

"AITA for “ruining” my best friend’s bachelorette party by “talking politics”/ calling the groom’s sister a racist?. I was at my best friend’s bachelorette last weekend. And according to her sister/MOH, I’ve ruined everything. I feel like shit about this whole situation, fwiw. Bride = B, groom’s sister = GS

Background: I was born in and am a citizen of a controversial country and where I live now. Said country has issues and the current government is shit. But there is also a lot of misinformation out there. I’m not here for a debate, so please don’t. I went back to do my required military service but was never in a position near combat. B and I have been friends since we were kids. 

She was cold most of the weekend but I figured it was because we had never met. The last night we were all fairly drunk and in a cab. A girl asked how you say something in my native language, and I did. GS rolled her eyes. I asked her “what?” She answers that it sounds a lot like her guy’s language, but “your people steal everything from them”. I say that’s because they’re the same language family. She rolls her eyes. 

We get back and start setting up a game of scrabble. She pulls the MOH into a side room and yells at her about inviting me.

We start the game. Rude comments the whole time. Finally, she makes a “joke” that’s just super offensive for historical reasons and I say “You know that’s not ok, right?” She gets really mad with me and I explain the history.

She answers that maybe we should stop doing bad things and we won’t be accused of stuff. I say that if a country does awful shit that doesn’t mean you get to bring back 500 year old genocidal propaganda. I add that I don’t want to talk politics.

GS says we are the new (group that committed genocide against us). GS also implies that everyone from Country deserves it happening again. I get mad and say that that is not ok, and she should be ashamed. And that there are ways to criticize Country without being a racist, and calling for genocide makes her more of a (genocidal group) than I’ll ever be. She says she can’t be racist because I’m white (I’m mixed), and that I probably committed war crimes. I say I was nowhere near anything like a combat role. She says was “supporting the genocide” and that we need to get out of (other group who also lives there)’s land. I tell her my father’s family had been there for centuries, and she gets pissed, calling me a liar. Then she starts angry crying. 

 Apparently she cried all night and Bride and MIH had to comfort her. I’m a bad person for sleeping through it. I’m also a bad person for refusing to apologize, because making her cry and calling her racist was too far, as was “talking politics”. They’ve also said everyone knows how she is and I should’ve known better than to engage.

"AITA for wanting to see a movie with my boyfriend that my best friend wants to watch with me?. Confusing title, I know, but I'm gonna try to keep it somewhat vague, because they both use Reddit. Okay, so there's this super awesome movie franchise(I'll call it ABC) that I have been a fan of since I was a little boy. My best friend and my boyfriend are also equally in love with it, both long time fans. I met my best friend about 6 years ago and since then, we've watched these movies in theaters right when they come out. It's just one of those things we do together. We have other movie series, TV series, and video games that are ""our things,"" so this isn't the only thing we do together.

About 7 months ago, I met my boyfriend. He showed me all of his collections of different things regarding ABC, so I know he loves it as much as I do. Recently, he took me to the movies to see a movie connected to it(but not as connected as the rest) and there was a preview of an upcoming movie(also connected) and he said he wants to take me to see it. I said okay, because I want to see it with him, too.

Now, here's the problem. Movie 1 I watched with my boyfriend because my best friend had already watched it with his other friends(because they're all huge fans, too). Movie 2 is the preview we saw and Movie 3 is another upcoming movie, all tied into ABC. I'm betting most of you know which one I'm talking about. Movie 3 is the biggest, probably most important of the story, so I figured I could save that to watch with my best friend, and watch Movie 2 with my boyfriend.

I told my best friend that my boyfriend wants to take me to see Movie 2 and he got mad at me. He said that these movies are *our thing* and he wants to see them with me. I asked ""what about Movie 3?"" He got even more mad, saying ""especially not that one."" So, basically, I can't watch either of these movies with my boyfriend because my best friend wants to see them with me.

After this conversation, he was still mad and saying shit under his breath, I couldn't hear it. Then he followed with ""do whatever you want, you don't fucking care, so I don't care either."" Now he's pissed and won't talk to me.

Also, do they get mad at you frequently over similar situations?

"AITA for not responding during a rough time?. Some backstory: During my drug use, I started getting addicted. With that, I started getting awful benzo-esque withdrawals (panic attacks, fast heart rate, insomnia, nightmares, etc.) I needed support from my friends. I have a lot of them, and when I ended up sobering up I needed support from them badly. 

I was never very close with my family, so other relationships, whether it be an SO or some guys I smoke with, are what I rely on for support. Lately, I've grown *incredibly* close to some people cause of the support they've given me during withdrawal. Staying over/with me during panic attacks (even if it got late), asking what they can do to help or what not, giving me rides to places- I'm eternally grateful to some of these people and wouldn't trade them for anything. Now, I'm basically out of it (it would've been short, but was drawn out by a series of relapses) and I've realized something. 

In the midst of getting closer to all my friends, I started losing one of my closer ones. This friend of mine has been going through some rough stuff too, so I tried to give him attention, but he messaged me or called me every day during withdrawal to complain about something different. Whether it was something he could've avoided if he just listened to my advice, or something from his past, or anything. He was always complaining, always negative, always bitching to me.

Now, to the actual situation: I could not bare to deal with that during withdrawal. I had given him my full support before, way more than he had given me, but during withdrawal I couldn't do that. For years I had given (let's call him Nero for now) Nero my full support, thick and thin, through rough times and easy times, but for once, I couldn't do it. 

None of my other friends had a problem with me suddenly being kinda needy. I just needy positivity, and at some points, a hand to hold. And during night time, I had no one to help me cope. It was me, my panic attacks, and hopefully white noise, a documentary or something to keep me sane. But Nero gave me none of this. He offered his full support, but when it came to receiving his support, he eventually made it about himself and his poetry or becoming a poet (which wasn't all that good, but I never had the heart to tell him that.)

Eventually it got to the point where I couldn't go 10 hours without sending him a message without him getting upset, or even worse, telling me he felt like hurting himself. It was definitely not what I needed, but at the same time, I didn't want to desert him all together, because he was going through things. I knew if I told him anything straight up, he'd threaten to hurt, or even worse, kill himself. 

Basically, I ended up in a limbo; talking to everyone but him to keep my spirits decent but in the process ignoring a closer friend. I felt like he was weighing me down and stressing me out more, and the more stress I had, the more panic and relapse I was susceptible to. I feel really guilty. They say addiction can tear your relationships apart, but I've grown so close to everyone but him. I'm not sure if I'm just being a dick or if I realized he isn't as good as I cracked him up to be. Tell me, Reddit, am I the asshole?

Also, please spare me the ""drugs are bad"" lesson. The drugs themselves have taught me that well enough by now.

EDIT: Fixed a grammar error ","It's funny to me that you call him Nero, because before you mentioned his name, your story reminded me of a phrase ""setting yourself on fire to keep others warm"".

You're not the asshole. It may seem cold, but sometimes our biggest priority must be ourselves. Your story reminds me of a personal one, I had a friend who did not help himself at all; he used to just sit at home all day on comic book forums arguing over which Batman was better, or how this or that director ruined movies. There was no signs of him improving or even trying to improve himself, but I used to spend time with him because he had few friends. At the time, I was dealing with a lot of depression, which he didn't help; you need positive people Eventually I got tired of it, we drifted apart, and that was it. Was he worse off? Possibly, but I made the right decision. I looked after myself and now I'm doing well.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for staying out late at my company's Christmas party?. So, today was my[f] company's Christmas party. My SO knew that a good six weeks beforehand. 

The location is a good hour away with public transit. Party starts at 7PM. It's not a huge party, approx 40 people. 

It starts with the usual business speech which alone takes a good half hour, followed by a performance of one of our new members. All newbies have to perform something, it's some kind of tradition. First one has three parts and takes about a half hour. 

First course arrives at around 9PM and still 5 new people to go. Nice. We eat, talk, the usual stuff. The next performances were short, second course arrives at 10.   

Now our bosses get some presents, more talking and a few people go for a smoke. At 11PM, the last course gets served. After everybody ate up (it's close to 11.30) everybody gets to unwrap his/her secret santas little present. People get called to the front, unwrap it, show it and say thanks. Takes some time with approx 40 people. 

It's after midnight when everyone was through. Sucks for public transit because now I can't get home easily.  One of my coworkers (we're both students but never at the same time in the office, met him today) offers to drop me off at home because that's close to his way. He lives in another city, but I live close to the highway and it was only two minutes of detour.

We say goodbye to everyone at 00.45 and head off. With the car, it's a ~10 minute drive, while it would have taken me HOURS to get home with public transportation. He drops me off a 200m walk from where I live. 

So, I'm home at 1AM. My SO fell asleep on the couch and I go to bed silently, but he woke up anyway. Angry because it's late. Calling me names and claims that I cheated on him because I'm late and a guy took me home, or that I banged someone at the party. Refuses to listen and refuses to sleep in bed. 

And now I'm here and asking myself if I'm the asshole for staying out late? He said I could have been home at 10 if I really wanted, but I don't think that leaving the party that early (remember 1h with public transportation) was an option and it wouldn't leave me in a good light.

I never stay out that long, at least didn't have in the last years. Am I the asshole?","NTA

"AITA for calling bf’s friends out on BS behavior?. My bf and I have been together for about four years, and I inherited a semi large group of of his long time friends when we began dating. I have a lot of positive things to say about most of them but they grew up in a vastly different culture than I did (I grew up in a lovely mountainous blue state with lots of things to do and they are from a very boring, and drug laden, southern, red state.)
I am a female and the group just so happens to have a lot more men than women, so it can be tough to build the girl friendships I like to have. 

A few months ago, one of the groups couples (we’ll call them Cathy and Seth) ended up breaking up after about 6 years together. It turned out Cathy cheated on Seth with two separate male members of the group (we’ll call them Cain and Dylan).  Dylan happened to be one of Cathy and Seth’s roommates at the time, which made things even worse. 

S was very understandably devastated, as was my BF, watching S endure all this pain. Watching 2 thirty year old men cry over feelings isn’t something you see everyday. S ended up sleeping on our couch for about two weeks as we were the closest available friends to him. 

D then proceeds to essentially mock S on every social media platform, as well as to other friends in the group and make S so uncomfortable that he felt that he could no longer even sleep in his own house. 

As the weeks go on, and S moves away to a life changing job training program and Cathy moves back to red hillbilly state. D continues to mock S and begins to make several inappropriate and misogynistic posts as well.

At this point, I messaged D and told him I couldn’t take his shit posting anymore and I was unfriending him on social media. No one else in the friend group would even really condemn his actions and were happy to pretend like nothing even happened and acted like we just magically lost two integral friends for no reason.

D did not respond to the message but every time we’re going to the same event, he stirs the pot by pre-talking shit to mutual friends before I show up (please keep in mind how ridiculous this entire situation is, especially because we all range in age 25-34). 

My boyfriend tries to stay neutral, verbally but acts very standoffish to D and Cain. I’m not angry with him, he’s just incredibly non-confrontational. In private he’s expressed support for my actions and opinions.

Side note: Cain and I also don’t get along because of his violent alcoholism and my unwillingness to enable his destructive behavior (we’re talking 4 DUIs and actually being HIT by a car and shattering a leg, needing surgery, all while drunk). He’s sober now, but seems very uninterested in creating a relationship with me (that I tried to create post sober and pre cheating scandal) and is happy to just try and ignore me and spurn my attempts at conversation.

I no longer maintain any sort of relationship with Cathy.

So, AIMTA for not staying quiet and becoming somewhat confrontational when I see people act like this?

"AITA for not going to see my friend's puppy even though she invited me to?. So this happened some time ago but my friend is still bitter about it and I want to know if I really am the asshole.

Mind you we were kids (about 13) when this happened and she still calls me out on this. My friend, (Let's call her Gracie) got a new dog. She has and older dog already. Gracie likes to make up things about others when she's mad at them. To me she always has pulled this one card over and over again. ""You're only my friend because of my dog"". I know it's not true and I think it's extremely childish. She said this because we happened to become friends at the same time as she got her first dog.

Well Gracie saying this to me really started to piss me off. Then she got a puppy and she was so excited. I was happy for her. She wanted everyone to come and see the new pup. She obviously asked me to come too. I declined, because I remembered what she always said about me just wanting to be with her dog. She showed me pictures and all and the puppy was really cute. But every time she asked me to come I made up an excuse. I'd hang out with her outside and we hung out at my house, but I didn't come to see her puppy until some time had passed.

The dog is now an adult and still adorable, so I don't think I missed out. Me and Gracie are still best friends. Sometimes she casually tells her other friends how I didn't care about her dog when he was a puppy, I didn't have time for him etc. She blames me and makes me seem really bad. I never told her that I just wanted to show her that I was her friend for her and not her dog. 

Honestly I don't regret it, but Gracie thinks I should. So, Reddit, AITA for not going to see the puppy?

"AITA for not getting something off the printer for my coworker?. **Backstory:** I work as a program assistant for a small non-profit program. It's treated like an assistant manager position and my boss treats me as an equal, especially after I covered her maternity leave last year. 

We had a new hire start this past January and I've had a couple issues with her in the past where she thinks she can micromanage me. She is pretty domineering yet she has no clout in this agency. But as always, everyone always panders to the domineering one.

The issue is, that I have trouble being assertive. It's a weakness on my part and I'm working on it on therapy. I recognize my coworkers have taken advantage of me since I worked here, bu I'm trying to move past it.

Today, this particular coworker, without asking anyone decided to set up shop in the annex building's conference room (We're less than a block from the main building). Her boss called my boss looking for her because she's not supposed to be doing this. She has been told no several times before, yet she still does it.

My boss is in the conference room telling the co-worker to pack up to listen to the co-worker whining because she didn't want to go to the main building to work. (Her rationale is that her office mate has clients, which is understandable but her boss has offered her other solutions. She refuses to listen to them).

When I walked in the conference room, my co-worker demanded me to get her papers off the printer. I told her ""no, it's not my job,"" where she proceeded to yell at me because I said no, telling me I don't want to mess with her. She also threw in ""I'm not being disrespectful, but next time I will be.""

I was fighting tears at this point, as aforementioned, assertiveness is not my strong point. But I managed to get out ""Okay, you don't have to yell at me for this."" And I walked to the bathroom to calm down.

When I calmed down and went to the bathroom, there's my boss being a pushover to this woman, looking for the papers on the printer, which my coworker never printed. It made me feel like the asshole slightly because my boss makes me look ""mean"" for asserting myself.

I don't feel like walking to the printer back and forth, especially when I have a physical disability that everyone here vaguely knows about. I've been in a flare the last few days. But  I don't feel like I should need to defend it in a situation that's not relevant to my job description.

"AITA For turning off the laundry machines in my apartment building when tenants are using it past usable hours?. I'm new (30yo male) to living in a reasonable/nice/average apartment building filled with young people. Moved to new city because of job. I live in the apartment next to the laundry room on the first floor. 

*The rules of the laundry room goes: laundry hours between 7am to 11pm. 

The noise keeps me up at night, doors slamming, people moving, laundry machines active. The landlord strongly suggests that I should call the police on other tenants (if I see them not respecting the rules). Which is apparently okay with the city and police. The landlord has put up signs, emails, directly contacted people through email and by talking to tenants directly. 

Recently I've begun turning off the machines if they're in use past 11pm. Last night I turned off some dryers at 11:35pm and the other tenants picked up their damp clothes at roughly 12:15am.

Its a dick move I feel however I know everyone knows the rules because it's been made obvious and clear. Do I want to call the cops? Not really but obviously it's the appropriate thing to do. I'm thinking I'm fighting fire with fire. The international students across the hall from me continue to use it past 11pm even though my landlord and I mentioned it to them in person. I'm trying to get my beauty sleep by the time someone starts using the machines next door to me.

TLDR: People aren't obeying the laundry room rules. Since I live right next to it and I go to bed early during the week I've started turning off the machines in use past 11pm and screwing people over with their laundry.

You seem to be in an impossible situation.  If I was you I would try to put more pressure on the Landlord, they are the one who is responsible for this not you.  Maybe they can automatically cut power to the machines at 11 or something.

"AITA for being upset over the way my parents treated my ex?. So recently, my long time SO and I broke up. When we started dating she was my boyfriend, but she came out to me as trans. I really wanted to give it a try because I loved her- but we found we weren’t sexually compatible anymore, so instead of dragging the relationship out and resenting each other we decided to mutually split so we could maintain our friendship. It has been so much better now- and it almost feels like I gained a sister rather then lost a partner.

Here is the problem. We had been living with my parents and paying rent. I had been on disability and could barely afford to live, and then my family needed help financially so we paid a good amount of rent and everyone was fine with the arrangement. They called my SO their family and loved her.

When we broke up, we obviously planned on her finding a new place to stay. Sharing a room was a little tight for us anyway and we though more personal space now that we weren’t dating was good.

We didn’t even get a chance to tell my parents that.

Less than 24 hours after we broke up my parents said she had 2 weeks to get out. I was shocked because they had never been hostile to her before- and they couldn’t even wait a few days to tell us she needed to move out. My ex is really hurt by this- her family was not supportive of her coming out and my family had become her adoptive family. She feels like she lost yet another family.

I tried to talk to them about this and they just said ‘this is hard for us too’ and wouldn’t talk to me at all. Luckily we have a friend who happened to have a spare room for a good price offer my ex a room so we are moving her out in time, but my feelings are really hurt.

I didn’t expect her to keep living with us- and it’s their house so I respect their rules- but we paid rent and having them spring this on us less than 24 hours after we broke up really has caused a rift between us. 

So, AITA for being really upset with them? I’m honestly having a hard time imaging how I’ll forgive them.

EDIT 2: my parents have also said they do not want me to leave because they need the money I pay for rent. ","NTA.

"AITA for holding Starbucks?. Wife and I headed to our favorite local coffee shop this morning but stopped by Starbucks first to grab an iced tea that the local shop doesn’t have.

We walked in to the coffee shop (after getting Starbucks) and the guy who I’ve seen dozens of times says hello and asks what I’m getting. I begin to order myself a breakfast sandwich and muffin when he cuts me off mid sentence and says “that’s a pretty nasty look don’t you think?”.

I’m confused and he says it again pointing at the Starbucks tea I’m holding. He then asks my wife and I to leave and won’t let me proceed with ordering. He claims we should have known no outside food was allowed in, and says we’re not welcome.

"AITA for enlisting in the army for benefits and nothing more?. Backstory: I grew up in a financially poor family. I was an aweful student and barely graduated high school. The only way I would've been able to go to college directly after high school would have been some low tier community college paid for by grants and student loans. I decided against this because I knew I wasn't ready for college and  would've failed. I also feared loans. I didn't want to be poor AND in debt. So I decided to enlist in the army to earn some solid benefits that would set me up for an opportunity at a successful life. I was only in the army for a few years.

"AITA for asking my husband to sleep on the couch?. On Sunday I injured my back. Only today was I finally able to bend down over the sink to brush my teeth. Everything is uncomfortable, but sleeping is the worst. It’s very hard to find a comfortable position and I’ve been waking up multiple times a night to move around/get comfortable.

My husband is very difficult to sleep with. He’s a big guy, and he likes to sleep in the middle of the bed. He snores, flails, and gets very hot at night. On an average night I wake up 2-5 times and ask him to roll over/give me blankets/move positions so he stops snoring. 

This week, between my back pain, my inability to get comfortable on my 1/3 of the mattress, and his normal night time behavior I have been sleeping 3 hours total at most. I’m grumpy when I don’t sleep (obviously not his fault) I work a lot at a high energy job (with kids) and coupled with my back pain I was really struggling. 

I asked my husband for the first time (in the entirety of our 9 year relationship) if he would mind sleeping on the couch so that I could get some sleep.

"AITA for not wanting to spend that much time with my mom?. So here's the thing, my parents got divorced when I was like 7 or 8 years old. My mom was crazy and my dad decided to leave, my big brother (10 at the time) and me (8 at the time) stayed with my mom, she did alot of weird stuff, from hitting us to faking her own death so we would listen to her, if we didn't listen she'd die. You'd imagine how traumatizing that could be for a kid, right? Anyways, 2 years went by with stuff like that, until one day one fight escalated and she kicked out of her house without even calling my dad.  


My dad picked us up and we've lived with him ever since. I'm now 25 years old, my relationship with my mom has always been only seeing her during birthdays and ocassionally on my grandma's. She has had a rich boyfriend for a while now, so she, for some reason, thought that giving my brother and I free stuff would make things better.  
Now, I've been working my a\*\* off, working and studying at the same time, since I was 17 to graduate college, it's been a slow process but It's been paying off. I've asked her to help me with my tuition but she refuses everytime (she could, she buys expensive stuff each week and my tuition ain't that expensive, I got a good scholarship), but she keeps getting me and my brother clothes and stuff we don't really need because she likes to, for another reason I don't understand, brag about me and my brother with her female friends, so she uses her boyfriend's money to buy us clothes, but she won't even chip in for my college studies.  


On the other hand, my dad has always been very supportive, he has had issues financially, but he's always tried to help, and for that I'm forever grateful, I wish I could be as half as a good dad he has been to me and my brother.  


Now, her rich boyfriend has been diagnosed with cancer, doctors gave him less than a year, so yeah, you'd imagine. My mom was very dependant on that guy both emotionally and finantially.

"AITA for “destroying” a gift?. Ok. This happened several years ago and I hadn’t thought about it until recently when a friend told me a girl was mad at me over it. 

4 years ago a friend hosted a Christmas party at his house and we all brought gifts. We were going to exchange them. It was one of those white elephant gifts thing were we all tried to get a better present. It was also the first time I ever had alcohol (I was 21). 

I’m not a drinker but a girl that was dating one of my friends seemed to find it funny to try and pressure me into drinking. She had spent most of the night trying to get me to drink and at one point I said fuck it and began drinking. I don’t remember how much I drank, but it was quite a bit. 

Back to the story. The present I ended up with was a jar filled with chocolate powder of different shades. Each one stacked upon another to form layers of different color. Now, I don’t remember this part at all, but apparently while we were goofing off I shook it until the Layers were no longer visible and made a joke about it. I really don’t remember any of this. I remember most of that night, not that part at all. 

I thought whoever had gotten it had bought it. It turns out they hadn’t. The girl that had made it was actually my friends sister-in-law who had apparently spent a long time making the present because it was special. She was apparently really hurt by what i had done and held a grudge against me all these years. I didn’t know she made it or that she was angry. We had talked a few times since and I thought we were on ok terms. 

My friend had moved away for a while and recently moved back. First thing he did was host a party but before I could go he texted me saying the girl was still mad at me, informed me of why she was mad and told me that to keep the peace I should apologize to her at the party. 

I thought it was ridiculous to be mad at something that happened such a long time ago, but wanting to keep the peace I apologized to her at the party. I told her it was my first time drinking, but that was no excuse for me acting like a jerk. I said I was sorry for wrecking something she worked so hard on and I mean it, I didn’t want to make her feel bad. She said she accepted the apology but we didn’t talk at all for the rest of the night. That’s ok, I don’t mind and I didn’t try to push it. Her sister was looking at us and apparently the girls all knew about the “chocolate incident” even though I had learned about it only a few days previously.

I've been wanting to move out for quite a while as I'm 20 and still live with my parents and siblings which is just uncomfortable. The job market is far better down closer to where my GF lives and it's a more calm and quiet part of the state,  which I much prefer.  

Unfortunately, my Mother thinks that I just want to move out to ""escape"" my family, and my Friends are the type to throw the whole ""don't dog the boys"" bullshit.

"AITA for yelling at multiple coworkers to to stop lying to the customer and stop screwing up a customer’s account?. In the one year I have worked at my call center job this is the number one reason why it is so stressful. It’s rarely the customers that are the issue. It’s the sales people and coworkers that either lie to customers to get a sale, fail to disconnect service when requested or completely screwed up the customers account so when I take their call I have to spend an hour trying to fix the problem and it’s hurting my performance metrics and I have to be on a performance review. 

One time a customer called about why her bill jumped up $100. When I reviewed the account I found that the she called about her missing local channels and the representative gave her a $10 one month promotion on the account, BUT in doing so, she replaced a new customer promotional offer for 2 years with it. I had to spend 1 hour with management, the support department and explain the situation and they could not put the promo back on the account. I explained this to the customer and he was understandably upset. 

Another time, a representative from my center cancelled 3 wireless lines on the account for a customer when she gave no one permission to do it. Because the cell phone account is combined with her TV and internet, the only way to restore the lines is to seperate the cell phone account from the rest of her services which could take 3-5 days. That was a one hour call trying to find a solution that doesn’t leave the customer without a phone for no fault of her own. 


Oh and here’s another one. 

There was a promotion for free internet for life if your service is in Chicago or LA. Some idiot told a customer who was in Atlanta that she qualifies for free internet if she signs up for an expensive cell phone plan. The customer started cellphone service only to find that she was not eligible for the free internet. Guess who had to tell her this. And guess who got royally screwed over. She was way outside the return policy so she’s stuck paying for her phones month for the rest of her 2 years. This was one of those times where I had to send them a PM as to what article they used to determine that the customer was eligible for the offer. 


For these situations, I do not have the means to report them and I was recently told that agents are not allowed to send emails to other agents. The only thing I can do is “handle the call”

I had to either PM them or vocally let them know that they screwed up the customers account. I got a sit down with my manager who told me that someone reported me for harassment? I don’t understand how this is harassment when I want people to do their jobs. I was told to just handle the call and move on, even though handling the call results in bad surveys and disconnect metrics which I shouldn’t have to put up with.

"AITA for treating my stepfamily like extended family at my wedding?. My parents got divorced awhile ago, and both got remarried when I was an adult. Both my stepparents have their own adult children. I like everyone and never had a problem getting along with them, but I never thought of my step relatives as being on the same level as my parents or siblings since I didn't grow up with them. I think of them as extended family, and that's how I treated them at my wedding.

I didn't think I was doing anything bad, but I found out that my stepdad and his kids are upset that they weren't included in the wedding like immediately family. I didn't include my stepdad or stepmom's names on the invitation or ask them to walk down the aisle with me and my parents. I wasn't trying to be deliberately exclusionary, they're just not my parents, so I didn't include them in those traditions. I also didn't ask any of my step siblings to be in the bridal party or have any role in the ceremony because we aren't that close and I don't feel like I have a sibling relationship with any of them. 

I did include my stepfamily in photos, but not all of them. We took photos with different combos of people, including some with just my parents and just siblings. I included my stepfamily in photos that included extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) but not the parent and sibling photos. It never occurred to me to have my stepfamily in immediate family photos and I wouldn't have been comfortable including them in all the photos.

As far as I know, it's only my stepdad and his kids that are upset, not my stepmom and her kids. I don't really understand why they are upset at not being included at such a high level, since we aren't that close. I would think it was weird if one of my step siblings asked me to be a bridesmaid, or if my mom walked one of them down the aisle. AITA?","NTA! Your wedding- your decision!

I have been on Instagram for several years now. For the first few years I did pretty standard ""Insta-girl"" stuff but last year I got a very quick ""pay for promotion"" gig with a bikini/swimwear company and it totally took off.  I am from a southern state and have a very ""country"" look so it wasn't too long after that that I was contacted by several firearm accessory and hunting companies and these were real paid work. If things continue as they have for the last few months, I will make enough from IG to more than pay for college.

"AITA for “parenting” my niece. This happened last year but it always bothered me. 

My niece is 13 and goes to a fairly rough school in the Deep South. She came home from school saying she almost got in a fight (very common at her middle school) bc some girl “stepped to her” and she called this girl a d*ke. Luckily a teacher deescelated it but no one got in trouble bc they didn’t hear the various slurs thrown around. (Other girl saying racist/anti gay stuff too). 

I sat her down and explained to her that d*ke is a slur and she should delete it from her vocabulary, that if she keeps talking like this not only is it super hurtful but she will get her ass kicked one day soon and various other ways to control her temper and deal with middle school disrespect. 

My brother is the worst kind of redneck. He told me off for trying to parent her and said that n word had it coming to her for trying to fight my niece. He sees no issue with racial slurs and anti gay slurs. He uses them frequently to the point I’m honestly not sure my niece knew it was as bad as it is, bc it’s so frequently used at their house.

"AITA For asking for exact payment from friends?. My friends and I recently went out to dinner at a restaurant that’s quite expensive for college kids, but we decided to splurge for end of the year.

When the check comes, the waiter says the 8 of us will need to be on one bill. There’s some silence at the table, so I offer to put the charge on my card.

I’m already a bit thrown off because a few people in the party ordered appetizers that the rest of us didn’t eat, yet when calculating the they split the app evenly. (It was only a $2 difference for me so I didn’t want to make a fuss). Also, I asked everyone $1 for tax when it was actually $1 and some change to keep things simple.

But when everyone sent me their payments later, I was about $15 short. One person owed me at least $5 more and she gave it to me then but I was still left about $7 short. I went home and did the math and it ended up being that a few people were just $2 or $1 short, but it all adds up. As a college student, I could get a whole other meal for $7.

I jotted down the math and sent a pic to my friends explaining how everyone’s bill chalked up and who still owed. But honestly, they seemed a bit perturbed that I was making an ordeal out of just a few dollars.

AITA for asking for exact change? I thought I was doing a favor by putting it on my card (and honestly in the past, when someone has paid for me I always overpay them a little back if anything!)

EDIT: lots of people asking why he couldn’t split the bill. One of the guys in our group knew the restaurant owner, so we were offered a discount but the server could only apply that to one bill. Either we could all get the discount one bill, or it would only go toward one person.

"AITA for allowing people who text and walk to bump into me?. I’ll keep this as simple as possible. I live and work in NYC.

"AITA for ignoring/not having any contact with my father's family?. This might take a few paragraphs to get through, but here goes:

&#x200B;

My mother and father were not together when I was a child and I had no memories of my father from when I was small. There weren't any pictures of him and, as far as I was aware, he never asked to take us for a weekend or anything of that sort. There was one occasion, a foggy memory, where he apparently tried to buy me some candy when he ran into my mother with my (older) brother and I, but I can't speak to it. There's also a more vivid memory of going to a doctor's office, my brother being furious the whole time and us sitting across from some guy. Turns out that entire day was testing paternity. Child support and the like was apparently contentious.

&#x200B;

Let's fast forward to early adolescence. Apparently a plot is concocted to utilize my father's brother and my brother's love of Madden to get him to see his father. If my uncle beat him in a game then he'd have to see his father, if my brother won then he didn't have to. My brother demolished him. He was pretty good in Madden, so I think he really beat him here, but who knows. Regardless, my brother meets our father and I don't. They start a relationship which is pretty good til this day. I remember not wanting to go because I was too afraid to meet a stranger.

&#x200B;

About ten or twelve years after that I'm working as a garage attendant in my local neighborhood and someone pulls up to get out and it's my father. I'm twenty-five and this is the first conversation we've ever had. I start to see him around the way and he gives me his phone number, tells me about family events and says there's an open invitation. At one point his wife (not my mother) stops me in a supermarket because we look so much alike and invites me over for dinner. I say maybe, I never go. Quick note: I get stopped all the the time by people who mistake me for my father because everyone has been in the same neighborhood for fifty years. He has a son with his wife and in that regard I am the purest sense of asshole because I never gave the kid the time of day. I think it was some combination of envy, jealousy and anger that made me act the way I did. He's about ten years my junior.

&#x200B;

This all came to a head this past July when my older brother and his wife had a baby shower. It was mostly my father's side of the family. I got there early, so when everyone walks in they turn their heads, see me and stare like deer in headlights. I spent most of the early part getting up and walking over to introduce myself to fight the awkwardness. I think they were afraid of how I was going to respond to them, but because it was my brother's day I was cordial to everyone. I smiled and I even stomached a picture with my father and siblings (there are actually four of us, we have a sister who's oldest). Uncles, aunts, cousins--I met them all and my grandmother on his side. This was particularly trying because I had lost the light of my life, my maternal grandmother, the previous year.

We had an argument about it and he's not being understanding at all even though I apologised for waking him up. He said he will be sleeping on the couch from now on which is even worse as I'll wake up alone but I do understand he needs sleep.

"AITA for refusing to end my friendship with my internet friend?. I’m in my first relationship surprisingly, mostly because I have social anxiety and I’m very very shy and self loathing, so when my boyfriend asked me out I was elated.

Basically, we’ve been dating for a little more than a week since our mutual friend got us together, and he’s really sweet and nice though a bit hard to relate to since he’s popular and pretty confident. I know that my boyfriend has been attracted to me since 9th grade (we’re seniors now) though, so it’s exciting. 

The problem is that, since I’m shy,  I’ve only ever really had internet friends besides my two decent friends at school. One of my Reddit friends I got along with really well, and I added him on Snapchat and Twitter, which I only use to lurk since again, I don’t really have friends and my school friends and I only really hang out at school and text sometimes. I’ve been talking to him a lot since then, and we share a lot of memes and stuff, it’s fun.

My boyfriend added me on Snapchat and saw that I had a 267 day streak with my internet friend, and freaked out since my internet friend is the only one actively on Snapchat besides my last snapchats from about 20 weeks ago. My boyfriend asked me who it was and I explained that I met my internet friend a while ago. He asked if I’ve ever flirted with him (and I have) so I said yes, and admitted that we’ve mutually sent nudes back and forth a lot. My boyfriend got SUPER mad, even though I haven’t flirted with my internet friend at all since we’ve been together? I even told him that I have a boyfriend now and internet friend was all for it since he knows how I struggle to even just get friends. 

I don’t want to drop my friend just because I’m in a relationship now, and when I don’t flirt with him he really understands me still, we have really fun conversations about our similar hobbies and he gets me a lot since he has social anxiety as well. I also know a lot about his life now, his friends, his family, his pets, and crushes and stuff so I’ll feel a bit heartbroken if I end our friendship, especially since I don’t know if my relationship will last.

"WIBTA if I asked my Mom to stop critiqueing what I've cooked?. Hello, 
I'm 20 and live at home as a student. I like to cook so I make my own meals. My family works weird hours, so when we are all home, I will sometimes cook dinner for us all- and other days, I will just make for me. You can look at my page and see i cook decent (not to self promo but just to show tou im not making slop).We all have different preferences and schedules, and for awhile, I tried to accommodate that, but it became too much.

So, I will make myself breakfast. At night, I'll make myself dinner. I'll usually just make myself what I like and I'll save the leftovers, first asking my mom if she'd like (she gets home after i eat) or I will text my dad and tell him where the leftovers are if there are any because he gets home very late, and likes to eat when he gets home. He is not critical and I am aware of his likes and dislikes.
I have a gauge of what he will and won't eat, so if I make myself, a chicken with lemon, I know he hates citrus and will just text him before bed so he knows to grab something before he gets home or he'll ask like ""oh is there any x left? i can make a sandwich when i get back.""

I do a lot of the shopping so I typically know more of what's in the fridge. And yes, I pay for a lot of groceries.

My mom is very picky and harsh. A lot of times, she will ask me if I'm making myself dinner, to make her something but to her liking, in a rude way. I buy myself chicken thighs to eat. I also buy breasts sometimes, however on a day where i had 8 hrs of hw, its just me and im making something spicy  ill make myself some thighs and she always has a rude comment. I'll say ""I made some chicken, theres an extra. Ik you don't like dark meat but if you want you can try."" She will go on a rant about how fatty chicken thighs are and ask why i didn't make her a seperate one- in the past I've done this, she'll come home and have eaten and will be full and it's wasteful.

Tonight I made myself eggs in purgatory and when she got home and saw the leftovers, she decided to try them. I told her she should heat them because a cold poached egg won't taste right. She decided to eat cold eggs and cold sauce and then went on about how DISGUSTING it was. I didn't make it for her. I made it for me and threw an extra egg in. She decided to insult me, but continued to eat going, ""ugh, never make this."" It was extremely weird and then she heated up poptarts to ""wash the taste out.""

She does this often, she'll eat cold leftovers without heating and call them gross or go mad if I make myself something she doesn't want or eat dinner before her. When we eat dinner together, she sits on her phone, or puts on tv shows i hate, or complain about the food.She is a good cook but doesnt cook often for herself and then yells about what I make.  Honestly, it's unpleasant. Would I be an asshole to ask her to stop critiqueing me? I like eating in peace and hate being told that what I make is terrible when nobody else has ever said that?","NTA, You cooked extra for her, if she doesn't like it then tough tiddies, she can make their own food without being so awful about it.

"AITA for sleeping after a long plane journey instead of showering?. I (26m) tried out AirBnB for the first time on a recent trip to NY. I was staying in my host’s (24F) bedroom while she bunked with her roommate. I arrived after an 8 hour flight at what would be around 3am my time, but 10pm in NY. Met my host who showed me around quickly, pointing out the bathroom and the bedroom. I told her I was exhausted, so I just wanted to go to bed. I fell asleep almost immediately, and then awoke at about 4am NY time and I discovered a handwritten note had been slid under my door. The note reads as follows: 
“Hi, this might be your first time doing Airbnb so you should understand a few standard etiquettes. Airbnb is hosting so it is very different from a hotel or motel. You need to keep the room clean and free of odor because you are staying in someone else’s room. After your flight, you had a strong odor yet you didn’t take a shower before going to bed. As the owner of the room, the bed and the sheets, I am extremely displeased with this fact. You didn’t respect the cleanliness of my room.
Please keep this in mind during your stay. I might have to report to Airbnb if you fail to keep up with the personal hygiene and lower the quality of my room.
Best”

I’m a ‘shower in the morning’ person. I never really shower before bed. I also think that if you’re worried about people’s funk… don’t rent your room out to others. I mean, I get it, nobody wants a smelly room, but I assume she changes the sheets when someone stays. Anyway, I’ve not been able to stop thinking about the handwritten note since I got it so I thought I’d share it with the internet.

EDIT: here’s the note: https://imgur.com/6QHMCI1","Eww NTA, assuming you didn’t reek of something awful. This is a huge no go for AirBnb. You’d be well within your rights to say something to the company about the host making you feel uncomfortable.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA: for wanting to limit my interaction with my sister. First things first i love my sister and i wish our relationship never went in this direction but it did.
About 5 years ago i started dating my now husband. I had a 2 year old prior to our relationship so when we started dating we automatically became a family because he also has a child from a prior relationship. Im very motherly and nurturing in nature and work with children and have kids ect so of course my husband got the standard 1950s care from me and i enjoy pampering him as him me. i cook and take care of the babies but he does alot of modern age things he cleans and does laundry because im allergic to dust and he knows cleaning makes me ill. He woke up with our son at night so i can sleep throughout the night. So he did alot for me!

He does his thing she does his they dont do stuff for each other she doesnt 'submit' to him he doesnt 'overpower' her. She feels that how every relationship should be. Unforently at a family event she screamed at me after my fiance left about me continuing a abusive cycle and misogyny because i told my fiance to leave the kids with me so they can play.

"AITA for not switching seats on the plane with an elderly lady?. This literally just happened like I'm sitting on the plane and on Reddit as to not deal with reality.

I booked my flight home months ago and purposely picked an aisle seat up front so I can stretch and get off the plane early.

So my row has three seats. I get on and there's someone in the window seat. Then this older couple in their 60s (maybe 70s) gets on and the husband is in the middle seat. He then asks me ""would you mind switching with my wife so she can sit with me?"" My first thought is sure no problem, but when I ask him where her seat is, it's all the way in the back like more than 10 rows and in a middle seat. I politely say ""I'm sorry but I would rather stay here as I paid for this seat and I like being up front."" 

Then this chick behind in the row over goes ""oh come on, just switch with them.. you're alone and they're older than you"". I felt so awkward and again said no, I'd rather not. She then huffed and puffed at me and this older couple is still standing by me awkwardly, waiting for me to cave, finally this high and mighty chick decides that she's better than me and says ""I'll switch with the woman and you have my seat since you really need a front seat"".

Whatever, I switched with her because it was still aisle seat and only one row back. But now I feel like an asshole and people are looking at me like I'm a bitch.

AITA?? This couple isn't handicapped in any way, just older... Even then, they should have booked their seats together, right? Urgh.","NTA.

"AITA for refusing to allow my daughters around their grandfather after major brain trauma?. I feel like I’m trapped in between a rock and a hard place and I feel like such a jerk and I don’t know what to do. 

In August, FFIL was in a major motorcycle accident and suffered severe brain trauma. He’s been in the ICU from the beginning of August to the middle of October when he was transferred to a rehab hospital. He will never be able to be left alone again, will need round the clock care, and my JustNoMIL refuses to acknowledge that things will be any different. 

She is insisting that when he comes home (because she refuses to have him to go to a residential facility), that the whole family needs to be there to welcome him home. This includes our three daughters, ages 7, 4, and 4. 

I am VEHEMENTLY opposed to this. We had dealt with temper issues and short fuses before the accident, let alone after this injury. Since the injury, he has become mean to hospital staff and JNMIL, short tempered and explosively angry. 

I am refusing to allow the girls around him until both FH and I have a chance to assess what he is ACTUALLY like now. Because we’re in a situation where the relationship with ILs is extremely exhausting and toxic (see previous posts in r/JustNoMIL for backstory if you want to go down that rabbit hole), I’m now the villain in this story. How could I keep him from his grandchildren? SIL isn’t keeping her kids from him. How could I be so cruel? 

I’m trying to protect my children from a situation that could change their perception of their grandfather for life, as well as leave lasting trauma for them.

"AITA for not being bothered that my mum is dying. I know the title makes me sound like a horrible daughter but I’ll try and explain it as best I could without rambling. Also apologies for format, I’m on my phone.

Long story short my mum wasn’t great to me growing up. My sister died of meningitis when I was about 5 and my parents marriage fell apart, my mum turned to alcohol to cope, she used to get drunk and tell me if I’d died instead of my sister then my dad never would have left and they’d be a happy family etc, she then met this horrible abusive man online who later became my step father for about 10 years - childhood sucked, he threw me out at 17 with my mum not giving a crap. Literally as soon as I left home, he decided to have an affair with a woman at work and also threw my mum out (an unemployed alcoholic with no friends and nowhere to go). She turned to me for help and I wasn’t going to leave her so took her to her parents and left her with them to sort herself out and got on with my life.

In the years that followed we met up once or twice and I tried to keep some sort of relationship with her despite everything and the metric shit ton of mental issues I now have as a result of my upbringing but never really got anything in return. She was never one to call me to ask how I was, not even a happy birthday message. She never made an effort with anyone else in the family either - just kept herself to herself with whatever man she was with at the time.

Fast forward 5 years and I get a message from my Nan about 2 months ago to let me know my mums in hospital, nothing to worry about, but that she was going to visit tomorrow and did I want to come with. I said yes and we went the next day, and turns out my mum had lied as to not break the news over the phone, and she’d actually been diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer. I didn’t really feel anything at the time, put it down to the shock and being numb. I’ve visited her in hospital 3 or 4 times where my Nan has forced me to go with her, she’s completely bald, completely emaciated and I just feel nothing when I look at her.

In her words she had seen how many get at the end and didnt want that to be our final memories of her.

"AITA for being pissed that my friends are secretly taping me and sending the videos to each other?. I live with these two girls, Charlie and Veronica. I've been friends with Veronica for about two years, I met Charlie this year. I'm not at home that often, but every time I am, I try to sit down with them, chill out, usually Veronica and I smoke weed, ect. Well I can get a little goofy whether I'm intoxicated or not, but I feel like every time I let my guard down they start taping me, but only recently did I learn they do this. 

Veronica knows I hate having pictures taken of me because I hate my body, ect. Charlie tends to tape lots of people. (Also when I say tape, they do it on their iphones, sometimes through snapchat, ect.) Well anyway I have told them to stop but they keep doing it. It's really embarrassing. I have never had friends who do this. I feel like when I'm with my friends, I should be able to let loose, have fun, and not worry about how people are going to judge me. Veronica says she doesn't send them to anyone but Charlie and Charlie to Veronica - but Veronica has a whole slew of these tapes in her phone. 

So today, while we were having dinner, they started talking about them, and I bitched them out a bit. Now I am really fuming. i told them if they keep doing this shit, I can't be friends with them (although I didn't say this definitively or very seriously - the context was more light-hearted, but I was trying to make a point.) 

I am not sure if I can trust Veronica with the tapes. Once, she audiotaped one of our old roommates having sex for the second time, and it was really horrific, and she had everyone listen to it. So I feel like it's dangerous to have shit like this, even if they're just tapes of me saying stupid, silly things. Charlie hasn't really done any of this, but her boyfriend complains all the time about her taping him too.

So am I overreacting? Is this a normal thing for friends to do? I know it sounds light hearted but I'm always paranoid they're going to do it again. It's really upsetting me.

"AITA For Not Wanting to Give My Mother Half of My First Month* of Salary?. I'm a third year, borderlining senior year university student. I started my first job with REAL earning just a couple of weeks back (to distinguish from part-time jobs with salary just enough for me eating and spending on regular stuffs). 

Now that I have my first quarter of salary (I get paid by quarters, not month; that's why there's an asterisk), I want to spend it on something I've been wanting for a long time: a new laptop. As soon as I got paid, that's the first thing I thought of. I've been using this beat up Acer laptop since first year, and now it is extremely slow; the battery requires constant plugging in order to run properly, etc. So I wanted to wait until September (when I get my next quarter of salary) to spend the entirety of this quarter salary plus some of my savings to buy a laptop that I really want. 

It is currently summer, and I'm working 3 jobs simulteneously to save up for the laptop. Though tired as shit (I work everyday of the week from 7AM to 6PM), I've been giddy with excitement whenever I think of September and how I will be able to purchase my first laptop on my own. 

However, my mother talked to me about my jobs and earnings. Usually I don't talk to her about stuff like this that much, but since it's a new job and all, she wanted to know. I knew exactly what would come after when she asked how much did I got paid from that place. And surprise surprise, she asked me to give her more than 50% of my quarter salary. 

Note that I am still living with my family. They still pay for my meals and my bills, just not my allowance. This is why I don't know if I'm the asshole or not.

"AITA for intentionally excluding friends with social anxiety from events because I was sick of constantly having to follow-up?. So I am basically the social organizer for a large group of friends (mostly from university although we're all working now) because no one else can be bothered. This group has gotten REALLY big over the years (like 30-40 ppl from only 10) which means it can be a pain in the ass getting people to come to places.

Recently in the past year people have been really into boating events. We'd rent a big boat for a day and pay for food/drinks to be delivered and hang on the water with friends for a whole day. Its a blast but an absolute pain in the ass to plan. I've asked for help but no one volunteers, but everyone is always requesting these events to be planned, so I'm the one putting down deposits and getting everyone to pay me their fair share.

So this one big issue has cropped up. There are about 2-3 ppl in the group with clear social anxiety or some other anxiety that they claim makes them hard to commit to things. HOWEVER, they are always the first to volunteer and say they want to come to something, only for them to cancel last minute or make me chase them for money for WEEKS or even ask for refunds when they don't want to go anymore. I've probably lost over $300 paying for their spot for things only for them to disappear last minute. I've tried instituting deadlines for payments but they are the biggest complainers and will post on our group page about it, causing people to ask me to give them leniency because they suffer from mental illnesses but still want to participate.

Well lately I've just been texting people one on one and sometimes I seriously cannot be bothered to contact those 2-3 people because of the hell they've put me through. But now they've seen a couple of pics on social media and are crying out about injustice and how people like me exacerbate their social anxiety for excluding them. It's 50-50 with other people in the group.

So I’m 22F. I’m in my third year of college right now. I had a fucked up life my entire life, and I was raised by my grandparents until I was 15 and my grandmother died so I had to live with my dad. My biological mother is absuive and I haven’t seen her in 8 years now.

Anyhow, I love my father but I can’t just live at home anymore. We live in a 2 bedroom apartment when it’s me, my stepmom, my two step sisters (23 and 18), my 3 year old niece and two dogs. There’s a huge ant infestation on top of that. I’ve woken up with ants all over myself, and I can’t put a drink down for two seconds without somehow just a bunch of ants appearing right there from another damn dimension it seems like. I sleep in the livingroom with my little sister who up until now we had to share a tiny ass bed.

My step mom is mentally absuive, and a narcissist. She calls me worthless, useless, and screamed at me after I was put on anti depressants. I have severe depression and apart of it is because of her. I’ve cried so many times, and I can’t even get that much into it bc of the limit. My little sister is very disrespectful to me. I can’t even say hi without her giving me attitude. My stepmom also ignores everything I say and I’ve had to hide my phone as she will go through messages and even listen in on phone calls with family members.

I WAS supposed to get an apartment back in June, it was the proudest moment of my life... until I got laid off by my job a day before I was supposed to move in.

Anyhow, I’m here now, and I’ve tried so much to explain all this to my dad. All he does is yell at me and tell me I’ve been through worse, and how my step mom isn’t mentally abusive, how I should be grateful for what I have.

Please note that he is an ""entrepreneur"" for now 2 years and as such I don't really know how much he makes if at all with his business.

&#x200B;

My mother offered to give him a significant amount of money to help him pay rent even though she isn't earning nearly as much as I think he does.

Part of the reasons why I'm thinking that is because he always wears expensive clothes and also bought a Iphone 10/Hublot watch earlier this year and a MacbookPro the year before and went overseas on vacation with his girlfriend just to name a few.

After hearing my mothers offer which my brother promptly accepted I told him something along the lines of ""You're 23 now X. I think you should get your priorities straight if you can buy a fancy watch but not afford rent"". He told me to mind my business and started calling me names. My mother tried to de escalate the whole thing but I decided to just leave the restaurant and put more than enough money on the table to cover my meal as I wasn't gonna take any of it in this place because I know the owner.

"AITA for taking a job where my sister's boyfriend works?. Hey guys - thanks in advance for any opinions/advice you can offer me.

I recently became unemployed. I had to quit my job to go into rehab to achieve sobriety. This is a fact I'm not proud of, but is pertinent to the story. During this period I exhausted my funds on bills and groceries (not alcohol, somehow, for once.)

I work in restaurant management. At the previous restaurant I worked at, I quit to go to rehab. Here, I worked with a gentleman who recently left to be the GM at a new restaurant the has just opened in town. At the time, my sister's boyfriend, with whom I have a friendly and good relationship with, was looking for a job. Seeing as I had the networking in place to help him get this job, I hooked him up with the new GM and he landed the job. This happened while I was still in MGMT at the job I met the GM in question at.


Fast forward back to me quitting my job to seek sobriety (which, I'm thrilled to say, I've been working hard at and have been successful so far.) After expending my funds completely, I knew I needed a job immediately. Thus, I applied to serve at multiple restaurants around town. One of which was the restaurant I got my sister's BF a job at. I called her BF to see if he was cool with this, left a voicemail message, and received no response whatsoever. 

The furthest this convo got was him telling my sister he figured she ""would just call me back instead of him."" Queue: me telling my sister I was in desperate need of a job and planning on applying to this new restaurant her current BF was working at. Having worked alongside and known this GM for years, I knew I was a shoo-in. I interviewed yesterday and was offered a job on the spot. With $11 in my banking account, I, naturally, accepted the position.

This morning I received a call from my sister - furious at me for going to work where her boyfriend works. ""You don't mix family and business"" she stated over and over. This isn't necessarily a thought I disagree with - but I felt attacked in so much that I tried to reach out to him directly, and also directly notified her of my intentions (to no resistance.) She is convinced it might put her in an awkward position if we were to butt heads at work. However, from my standpoint, I am a very amenable co-worker, I've always had a good relationship with her BF, and they didn't show any resistance to this idea until after I accepted the job. I'd see things a bit differently if this were another industry, but, especially given its the service industry, I feel like I did my due diligence. This holds even more true given my (self-inflicted) financial situation.

"AITA for not letting my husband go out with coworkers for the next few weeks. My husband goes out for happy hour with his coworkers every Wednesday. He usually gets a little buzzed and usually I don't mind. However, I am now nearing my due date and have asked that he come straight home after work for the next 3 weeks just in case the baby comes early. Its also getting harder and harder for me to get things done on my own, so having him home in the evening when the older kids are also home would be really helpful to me.

My husband insists that since our first 2 came right on time, it's not a big deal for him to go out to happy hour to unwind.

"AITA for wanting an exterminator to come to our place when my boyfriend doesn’t think it’s necessary?. Also, WIBTA if I went ahead and arranged for an exterminator to come even if my bf doesn’t think it’s necessary?

Ok so we just moved into our rented place a few months ago and today for the first time, I opened the kettle to make some tea and a small cockroach came crawling out and it freaked me out. 

I kind of have a phobia so I called my dad right away. He use to be a superintendent for apartment buildings and he says that if you see even just one that means you have them and you have to call an exterminator to take care of the problem.

He said that it’s the landlords responsibility but that my dad was also willing to call the exterminator that he knows to do it and do it fast and he’d pay for it because my dad is helpful and kind like that. 

I spoke to my bf at work and he doesn’t think that’s necessary. He thinks because our place is kind of messy right now that if we clean it, it’ll be ok and that we only need to be concerned if “we see a sea” of them. 

My dad says that it doesn’t work like that and cleaning won’t get rid of them. He says if you see even just one you have them and that this is the best time to get rid of them before it becomes an actual infestation and I agree with it but my bf is being passive and an asshole about it and I pretty much told him that if he doesn’t want to call the landlord (he doesn’t) to deal with it and if it wants to live with them then that’s fine but I live here too and I don’t want to. 

So I said that if he didn’t want to call the landlord I’d just accept my dad’s offer.

"AITA for not letting go of a flash drive?. About a year ago I lent my flash drive with a Windows 10 installation to a buddy of mine so he could install Windows into his new computer. I was over there when we finished it and I plugged the flash drive into the computer to start the install, but my friend told me that it was gonna take forever and it was awkward just sitting around so he could take me home and he'd just give me the flash drive back later, I thought that was fine.

"AITA for not letting my sister's friend have the TV?. This happened a few months ago but I can't sleep tonight and it popped into my head. I love this sub but have never posted in it and I'm curious what an unbiased third-party thinks.

I currently live with my mother, sister and girlfriend. My sister has a friend named Jill. Jill comes from a wealthy-ish family. She never wanted for anything and she doesn't have many bills or responsibilities and it makes her a little bit entitled. (I promise this is pertinent.) 

A few months ago, Jill came over on a Sunday night to watch Game of Thrones. Our family has always been struggling lower-class but my mother has always been a huge TV person so we have subscriptions to most premium channels, including HBO. Jill had made a plan to come over and use our HBO to watch GoT, something she'd done before. My girlfriend and I were downstairs watching American Idol when Jill arrived and my sister informed us that Jill would be taking over the downstairs TV. (In our home, only the living room TV has cable hookup. The other TVs use Chrome Cast or Firestick for streaming.)

I said no. American Idol is a live show with voting and we wanted to watch it live. My girlfriend and I pay rent and that means we can watch TV if we want. My sister begins to get annoyed. I offer that Jill is more than welcome to watch GoT when Idol was over (since she knew she'd be running late, my sister DVRed the show.) Jill said she had to get up early and didn't want to wait til 11 and ""stay up that late."" (It was probably 10:20 by this time.) I told her I wasn't changing it and they both stormed upstairs.

5 minute later my sister texts me and says ""If she can't watch it down there, one of you needs to give her your laptop to watch it up here."" I was baffled because that isn't usually my sister's style. I ask her why Jill can't use HER laptop and my sister said it was because she was using her laptop to stream Walking Dead.

Now, my laptop is extremely old and cannot handle streaming. My girlfriend's laptop would have been fine but she barely knows Jill so it seemed really weird for her to just hand over her laptop for an hour while an acquaintance-at-best watches Game of Thrones.

I'm frustrated because Jill has her own laptop at home, and the capabilities to get her OWN HBO subscription, but she and my sister want ME to leave the room in the middle of something I'm watching to cater to her.

I tell my sister it's not going to happen and the two end up huffing and storming out to go to Jill's and watch it there.

And I want to know, AITA? Was I overreacting? Should I have just let her watch the show and gotten over it, be the bigger person? (I am the older sister, after all.) It just rubbed me the wrong way. At no point did anyone ASK for anything. Everything was demanded and EXPECTED. This was back in April or May but it still makes me wonder.

"AITA For saying no to New Years?. Obligatory apologies for formatting as I am on mobile. 

Facts: my husband has a bad habit of making what should be joint decisions between us on his own. At first I accepted this begrudgingly because I hadn’t finished school and he was the main bread winner. Now that I’m working full time I still do not make as much as him but I still contribute to household expenses.

 Our dinning room furniture, my car, vacations, etc.

He told me the plans last night. And when I was less than enthusiastic about traipsing through grave sites and eating in a tavern, he said I wasn’t being supportive.

"AITA for insisting my 17 year old sister pays the vet bill?. I'll try to keep it short. I (20f) live at home and go to college, I own a dog and pay for 100% of the expenses and take care of him. My sister and dad enjoy having a dog around as long as they're don't have to be responsible. 

My sister (17f) has a bad habit of leaving food around, specifically in places the dog can reach. I've talked with her (and my dad) about this often, explaining how sick it could make the dog. Every time she promises to be more careful, but it still happens. 

There have been several times that my dog eats the food she leaves lying around, and a few times it's made him sick (vomiting). I've explained again and cleaned it up the first two times, after that I made her clean it up. 

But now she left chocolate lying around (I think it was on the couch, I'm not 100% sure). My dog got very sick and we had to rush him to the vet, he's okay now. 

I told my sister that I wanted her to pay the bill, because this keeps happening and it's irresponsible. That she could either use the money she saved for her vacation or work for it and walk the dog when I'm at school until the 'debt' is paid. 

My dad things we should pay 50/50, because it's my dog and therefore my responsibility. I guess I could live with that too. My sister doesn't want to pay or do anything because 'it's not her dog and accidents happen.' I'd feel bad taking most of her vacation money, but this has been happening too often. 

AITA?

Edit: Monday though friday I'm at school, I hire a dog walker for once in the afternoon. He's alone the rest of the time, unless my family wants to play with him. He's okay being alone for a bit.

Edit: I'm moving out in 2ish months, so I'm moving my dog to a safer place. And I do have pet insurance, but that just means I pay part of the bill instead of the whole thing, it's still quite a lot.

Edit: Both my dad and sister had a say in whether or not I'd get a dog right now, they both agreed it was fine for those few months at home as long as they didn't have to pay for anything or walk him.

INFO: Yes, I'm training my dog. But he's still a puppy and the couch is his spot, he's used to getting some treats there. He doesn't try to get food from the kitchen or living room table, just the couch (and on occasion he has snatched something from the coffee table). I'm not sure how to teach him that he can eat dog treats but not human treats if they're in the same place, but I'm trying. Teaching him not to eat something off the street ever was much easier.

Our relationship is longer than either of his siblings' relationships, although not by much. We aren't married or engaged, not because we aren't committed, but because we  are young (almost done with grad school age) and people just don't get engaged that young in our circles (though we've discussed it). My boyfriend's mother even thinks that we are the best couple and the other two will actually end up divorced/etc, which she has told us.

"AITA for pretending to be ignorant about my in-laws’ traditional gender role expectations when we stay with them?. My husband and I have been happily married for about three years. We both live in the U.S. I (30f) am American born and raised, while my husband (32m) is originally from an Asian country. He immigrated to the US for graduate school, and he now has permanent residence here. We intend to live in the US for the foreseeable future.

Because all of my husband’s family is still back in his home country, we try to go visit them once every year or two. I love to travel so it’s mostly a fun and eye-opening experience for me, and I enjoy learning about other cultures, etc. When we go, we stay with his parents, as is customary in their culture (and because they live in a major metropolis where paying for a hotel for two weeks would be prohibitively expensive). 

The problem is that his parents abide by VERY traditional gender roles - as do most people of their generation in this country. Both his dad and mom had full-time jobs, but his mom was responsible for ALL the cooking (making three meals from scratch every day for the entire household), cleaning, and laundry (which also has to be done everyday). Even when his dad retired and his mom was still working, she did 100% of the housework and he did essentially none.

That certainly is their choice and I would never comment on that or look down on their way of life. The issue is that back in the US, my husband and I share all the housework duties pretty much 50/50. We both have the same graduate degree, and we both even have the same kind of job at the same exact institution, and we each make pretty much the same salary. This equal sharing of housework is important to us, since we both are very professionally ambitious and want to prioritize our careers.

When we are staying with his family in his home country, his parents constantly make comments and jokes and ask questions about my doing the cooking, cleaning, etc. Even though we’ve explained that we share the responsibilities back home, they can’t seem to fathom this. So I feel VERY pressured to do the cooking, cleaning at their house for them. In their society, when two people get married, the couple moves in with the husband’s family, and the new wife takes charge of all the household duties so that the mother-in-law can “retire” from them.

Because his parents’ English is really rough (my husband often has to translate between us), I generally play the ignorant American and pretend not to understand that they seem to want me to do some of the cooking and cleaning when we’re at their house. That’s not to say I don’t help - I always help clear the dishes after dinner and I do my own laundry in their house. I basically do slightly more than my husband does - enough to be a polite guest but definitely not enough to fulfill the expected role of the typical daughter-in-law.

So AITA for pretending not to understand that my in-laws expect me to conform to their traditional idea of a daughter-in-law which would mean doing the housework when we stay with them?",NTA.

"AITA for ratting on a “friend” for scamming Target?. I have a “friend” who is a serial scammer and shoplifter, always wanting to get one on the store or the person.  She steals wine glasses and nice knives from restaurants, sheets and towels from hotels, pens from the bank, asks the bag boy to bring things to her car but doesn’t tip them, eats a protein bar at the grocery store and hides the empty wrapper, buys clothes from REI just for a trip and later takes it back for a refund... and lately, buys something expensive, returns it with something else in the box, so she gets to keep it, for free.  

It’s not like she needs the money or the things, “friend” is an ER surgeon and makes more than 10 of us on here combined. 

The last shenanigan was this one— she’s staying at our place for the week and the air mattress she’s sleeping on gets a hole in it.  It’s a fancy Aerobed.  She has the idea, to go buy a new Serta air bed at Target, use it, put the old broken one in the box, and return it for a refund.

I am a roomate here, the house and Aerobed belong to my guy friend, “Bob”. 

Bob likes his Aerobed, thinks he can patch it, and doesn’t want to lose it, but is too much of a wuss to stand up for himself.  He stays quiet.  He complained to me in private.  Maybe he also wanted a new bed for free.  * Here is where I don’t know if I’m the AH or not.

When she tells us about the planned scheme, I joke that this is how Target goes out of business.  The end of retail.  That I’m not bailing her out of shoplifter jail. 

She doesn’t care.

New air bed is purchased, for like $200, used for the week, and the broken one put in the box.  At the end of the week, off goes the old bed in the new box, to Target, returned for a full refund.  Target gets screwed over by the scam queen.  Bob gets to keep new bed.  

Not entirely sure why, but I’m pissed.

We have a stolen air bed in the house now, and I’m embarrassed to have this person as a friend.  ”Bob” tells me he felt bullied because the new bed is not as high quality.  But he didn’t stand up for himself, so why do I care, right?  

I care because this kind of stuff happens over and over again.  My friend is “proud” of her scam.  I know she’s going to keep on doing stuff like this.  At a macro level, stealing from stores makes goods more expensive, as they have to hike up prices to make up for losses.  It’s just wrong.

I called Target and told on her.

Manager thanked me, said employees were supposed to verify the contents of products when it was a high-value return.

"WIBTA if I took thousands of dollars from my ex and never talked to him again?. Okay a little background here.....

Three years ago, I (24F) studied abroad in Europe. On one of the first days there, I met a local guy (25M) and we started dating. Let’s call him Eric. Eric and I dated all semester and it was awesome. We continued the relationship when I returned to America for another year and a half. Honestly, long distance wasn’t too bad and we were really great together. We visited each other a lot and I spent thousands of dollars in airfare and lodging, not to mention the money I spent he visited me too. I had plans to go to grad school in his country and and had even put down a multiple thousand dollar deposit. 

A month before graduation, I feel into a spell of depression and really wasn’t myself. During this time, Eric was extremely unsupportive and told me that “depression isn’t real.” He eventually broke up with me because he didn’t want to deal with it. It was the hardest thing I ever had to go through and I ended up staying in America. I got a job and built a really good life for myself. 

About 6 months after the breakup, I received my first message from him since he decided to end things. 

And he had news............he won the fucking lottery (multiple millions of dollars.) I told him I wasn’t sure why he was telling me and pretty much told him to fuck off. It definitely sucked hearing he had such good fortune and it didn’t have anything to do with me. Oh and the kicker is that he didn’t have to pay any taxes on the winnings bc of his country’s laws. 

It’s been a year since he won the lottery, and he had started to reach out to me again. I lost my cool and told him to leave me alone. When he asked why I pretty told him that I wasted so much time and money on our relationship and he decided to dump me. Being on any sort of terms wasn’t really an option in my eyes. He had fucked up majorly and smashed my heart, and offset my future.  Oh and he’s still in love with me. *eye roll*

His response to this was to offer me $5,000 , with “no strings attached.” I initially and immediately told him that I couldn’t take money from him and that there would definitely be strings. He insisted there weren’t and has urged me to take it. 

I’ve talked to my friends and family about all of this, and they’re honestly split. Some think I should take it without a second thought but others (cough cough my dad) think he was so horrible to me at the end of the relationship that I should just ghost him forever. I live comfortably and don’t NEED thousands of dollars. I’m doing fine. But it would definitely help with my student loans.

"AITA for wanting my dad to wear a band shirt?. Okay so this is an alt account but i hope someone finds this and helps me out. 

Alright, so me and my dad have lived together since i was a smol child since my parents are divorced, i really love him a lot and he’s been there for me since day one. he married my stepmom and i had a family at about age 7 and i’ve lived with them since with my biological mom mostly out of the picture.

Well, when my dad married my mom, she already had a daughter, and were roughly 5 years apart (i’m 14f and she just turned 10f). I wasn’t used to it at first, but eventually i did.  

When i was about 10, my parents decided to sign me and my sister up for my local softball league. At first, it was a TON of fun and i loved it and being able to be competitive. My dad lived to coach my teams and since he was so busy with work it was our time to bond and just have a good time. He took me to all of my games and tournaments and i lived it for a time, because since he was so busy and i didn’t see him much i cherished it that much more.

But then around 7th grade (i was like 12), i started to dislike it and felt like my dad was pushing me waaaay too hard. i was on two teams at the time and only had one day off a week while also playing tournaments on sundays (my days off were wednesdays and that was when i started up music lessons).

Around this time i was getting introduced to band and i was starting to see other options to keep myself busy and i was having tons more fun with the people i was meeting. 

About a year later i decided to quit softball, because i was getting tired of it and it just wasn’t fun anymore. When i told my dad, i could tell he was devastated. When he was growing up, he played baseball and i know he just wanted me to have that experience but it just wasnt my thing.

At the same time i was starting to take off in band. I was getting solos and everyone voted me band and orchestra student of the year. I was even recognized by the band directors of my future high school. Everything was going right. Mind you, this was last year (8th grade year)

While my sister is still doing softball, he wears the shirts for her team and some of my old teams occasionally. Spirit wear forms came by and i got a zip up hoodie. I wanted at least one of my parents to get one too, but they wouldn’t 


I know that they support me in what i do, and they even came to my first parade on saturday. i get that. I just want my dad to get a t-shirt to make myself happy because i see him wearing my or my sisters softball shirts.

I told him how i was feeling and i was called insensitive and that they won’t come to support me anymore if i don’t recognize how much they support me. i understand they do, i just wanted them to get a band shirt since they get softball shorts every season.

AITA?","NTA

I am very sorry your parents reacted this way. You sound like you are putting in a lot of effort to do the things you enjoy. It’s good you reached out to your parents. Don’t write them off entirely, your dad probably though of raising a softball playing kid for decades and to have one get there and then stop may put him in a spot where he’s acting in emotional instead of rational ways. They may still not understand how much wearing the clothes means to you. Maybe the way to think about it is less they don’t support you but they aren’t supporting you in exactly the way you want.  Maybe they don’t know exactly what you expect out of them. I bet if you clear this up things will get better. Good luck",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for wanting to get rid of my friend?. Me and my friend are both 25. I live with my girlfriend and he still lives at home with his parents. He's never had a job. He's socially awkward. We both have mental health problems but his is more severe, imo. I managed to get a job after getting through the death of a relative and agoraphobia and he hasn't bothered. He is pretty much at the point of no return.

A few years ago, he had some phantom pain in his neck. The doctors would not prescribe him any medications so he bought them online. It's not exactly legal if you catch my drift.

He would always get Xanax or really strong painkillers and he became addicted. He would get them sent to his house. He later banked up so much Xanax that he would just sell them on for profit because he had more than he knew what to do with.

His mother is an alcoholic and she's got years of painkiller abuse under her belt. She found out that he was buying drugs online and intercepting the mail before he woke up. She didn't really care - free drugs for her. She would take all of the Xanax in the package and zone out for 2-3 days.

Eventually he found out that she got to the drugs in the mail before him but even when he did, he would leave them on his desk in his room and she would sneak in and take them.

He got frustrated with his living situation and he t so he decided to code a dark net market for profit and thought he would become the digital Pablo Escobar. I was like okay, whatever. You do you.

Before he launched his market, something terrible happened. He was in the middle of trying to get off of Xanax and Tramadol so he ended up taking methadone to help him. His Mum snuck into his room while he went shopping with his Dad and took a whole TWO BOTTLES of methadone. She died.

He texted me super casually and said ""My Mum is dead. She took my Methadone.""

Didn't know what to say, thought he was joking.

""No, honestly. She's dead. She took all of my Methadone.""

I went to the funeral a few weeks later and I cried violently. I wasn't even close to his Mum but I thought I would show up and pay my respects.

He didn't cry. He didn't show a shred of emotion and it made me feel really uncomfortable. This was around the time when I thought if I should stop talking to him or not.

A week later, he messaged me and said that everyone in the family blames him for his Mum's death. The police have taken his phone and computer while they look for a cause of death and if he said something to deliberately get her killed.

Not much happened afterwards. I've been really busy with life stuff when earlier today, he messages me and he's like ""I'm starting up the market again.""

I said it's not a good idea at all. The Police are on him like a hawk and I don't think he has grieved properly.

""Okay, I'll just focus on myself from now on. I can see you don't really care.""

___

From that point on, I don't really want to speak to him. He pretty much single handedly killed his own Mum. I thought the weight of the guilt on his shoulders must be enormous but it feels like it doesn't seem the matter and he is immune to it.

I'm the only real friend he has and I don't want to really turn my back on him but it's just been a clusterfuck for him lately and he manages to draw out negativity from all angles.

** TL;DR: Friend who's a recovering drug addict, kills his Mum through lack of common sense, turns cold hearted and I'm having a hard time turning my back on him. AITA?"" **

"AITA? Girlfriend hates my best friend and I don't want to take sides.. I’ve been with my girlfriend for two and a half years. We are having problems, and most of those problems are beyond our control (not having enough time with each other due to the overwhelming complexities of life, and the stress that comes with that). My best friend I have known since high school, about 15+ years. Our friendship is the type where we don’t get too deep with each other, but we have had tender moments in the past where we’ve shared personal things with each other and he’s always had my back and I’ve had his.

&#x200B;

I meet my girlfriend and our relationship develops far from where I’m from. We were long distance for a while but not so long distance to where we can’t see each other on weekends. We don’t really develop our relationship in the area I am originally from because my roommate was a little crazy and didn’t want overnight guests, but the rent is cheap and I don’t want to move out right away. So I spend more of my time about an hour away in my girlfriends area (about an hour drive away). It takes a while for me to introduce her to my friends. 

&#x200B;

I eventually move to my girlfriend’s area but I’m also feeling unhappy because I’m not really seeing my own friends as often anymore due to the distance, wanting to balance the time with my girlfriend, and also not really knowing how to make new friends in the area. One day I get the chance to introduce her to different friends of mine at first. I’ve known one girl and her husband for about 12 years (I met this girl at one of my first jobs) and they all get along with my girlfriend. My girlfriend really likes them. It wasn’t until yesterday that I introduce her to my best friend from high school because both of them are busy people, since he was in school (college), my girlfriend was in school (college), and my friend had the time and offered to come out and make the drive to hang out for the afternoon. 

&#x200B;

I know it sucks that it has taken this long to introduce her to my friends, but I didn’t really want to overwhelm my grad school girlfriend because of how much time she has to invest into her course load. I realize that maybe I should have made more effort in introducing them sooner. Either way, my friend comes out and everything is going fine at first. Then we go to a nearby place for some drinks and chat. At one point I had to go home and grab something (I forgot to bring something with me), but it was close by and would only take 15 minutes. Girlfriend and my friend seem to be having a good time and my girlfriend says it’s okay to go home really quick, she's enjoying her time, so I leave and come back.

&#x200B;

When I get back everything seems to be okay. I thought it was cool that they were bonding. Girlfriend orders some food, and my friend orders another beer. We hang out for another hour or two and my friend is talking about our past, how we met each other, all the things we would used to do together, etc. We finish our drinks/food and decide to go back to our place to wrap things up as my friend was planning on leaving in another hour and a half to see some other friends. When we get back we talk about his dad a little bit (his dad is not having the greatest time) and my girlfriend excuses herself. 

&#x200B;

About a half hour later my friend decides he needs to go, which is fine because the weather was starting to get a little bad, and it was starting to get dark. He has a long trip home and I understand. Me and my girlfriend say goodbye to him and he goes on his way.

&#x200B;

So immediately after he left, she goes on and on about how she was so glad it was finally over. I was confused about all of this because she had mentioned earlier in the day that she liked him. They seemed to be getting along too. Then she goes into a long rant about how narcissistic and self-absorbed he is, and that she thought I should reevaluate my friendship with him because of it. She is completely angry at this point, and she’s getting even more upset at my reaction to all of this. I literally couldn’t believe she was that upset.

&#x200B;

She told me she couldn’t stand how much he was talking about himself and his career, and she was offended that he asked nothing about her. I do understand why she would be upset about that, but I still stand my ground and say that she can’t make complete assumptions about his character after only knowing him for about four hours. She says she doesn’t think he’s all that great of a person, and I reiterate that he has been there for me in some of my darkest times. At this point she’s yelling, rolling her eyes, and telling me I’m invalidating her feelings in the matter. I’m really just trying to defend my friendship.

&#x200B;

She once again yells about how she was offended that he asked nothing about herself when she was asking him questions. She feels as if the reciprocation is not there and once again questions why I would be friends with someone like that. We are going in circles at this point and I’m once again telling her that she’s getting the wrong impression, that he’s not a bad person, that I thought four hours was not enough time for her to come to that conclusion, and she’s getting angrier at me. At this point I decide to leave, because I’m in complete shock, uncomfortable with how sudden and strong the anger is, and basically acts like a total asshole as I’m leaving. That I’m taking his side and all of that. 

&#x200B;

A little bit of a background: my girlfriend doesn’t really have friends. I’ve met people she used to be friends with at her previous work, and while there were a couple of them I didn’t necessarily like all that much (I was not really all that compatible with them), I still thought they were okay people. She has since devalued those friendships and says she doesn’t really like them. I met another group of friends she had from a longer time ago and I actually liked them, but she said she doesn’t really like spending a lot of time with them because they are draining. So she avoids those friendships too and only sees them when 'she has the energy for it.' For the past year the only people she spends time with is me and people she has an acquaintanceship with in her grad program. She will hang out with new people, find something not to like, complain about them, and then she decides she doesn’t like them. I’m not really sure if she likes anyone, and I’m starting to think she doesn’t really like me either.

&#x200B;

She’s suffering from anxiety and depression, and is overwhelmed with her program. I wonder if this is in response to stress related to that, and I’m trying to be empathetic towards her but having a hard time due to the shock of her response. A part of me feels like I’m the asshole because I didn’t take her side against my friend, maybe I could have handled it differently instead of leaving, but I like my friend and feel as if she’s misunderstanding him. I don’t think she’s wrong in not liking him, she doesn’t have to like everyone I’m friends with, I just think she’s wrong in demanding I completely reevaluate the friendship in an instant. She seems to hate me now for taking his side.

&#x200B;

I have not told my friend what has happened yet. He texted me a while ago saying he had a good time and enjoyed meeting my girlfriend (that he thought she was cool.) I just don’t have the heart to tell him that he drove an hour out of the way to meet someone that hates him.

"WIBTA if I get a tattoo immediately after a coworker was told that she cannot get one?. (I know this is pretty similar to the post someone made about dyeing their hair at work, reading those responses is what made me think to ask here.)

I work in a combination workshop/storefront where some of us interact with clients and some of us don’t. There’s a dress code for the front-facing employees but the workshop employees, of which I’m one, can basically wear whatever we want as long as it’s safe around the machinery.

I’ve been planning to get my first tattoo for a while now and the appointment is scheduled for this weekend. It’s going to be on my arm so it’s going to be visible at work the majority of the time. It’s definitely not a problem, several of the other workshop employees have tattoos as well.

That said, this girl that works at the front counter asked my boss on Tuesday for permission to get a tattoo on her wrist. Our boss told her that while she’s allowed to get the tattoo, it has to be covered up by her sleeve or a bandage or something while she’s working. The girl has been pretty annoyed about this answer and has been bitching to anyone that will listen for the last few days.

I’m thinking about postponing my tattoo appointment for a while because I don’t want to rub it in her face and start drama by getting a tattoo immediately after she was told she can’t get one. Also I haven’t mentioned to anyone at work that I was about to get a tattoo, so I’m concerned it’ll look like it’s just coming out of nowhere and I’m intentionally trying to get a rise out of her.

"AITA for feeling dejected and wanting to ghost an ex?. Throwaway, if the creative username didn't give it away. Pretty sure she uses Reddit. I've got a feeling this is mostly a validation post, but I needed to get it out somehow with a first time post.

I (30M) have been friends with an ex for a good couple of months now. We dated at the start of the year, after meeting through a dating app and finding we had way more in common than we expected. We hit it off, and things were great for about 3-4 months.

She started getting a bit more bitter and critical as time went on, and it's then I discovered she'd only just come out of a longterm (several years) relationship a couple of months prior, when the guy she was with left her for another woman. Eventually, out of the blue, we met up one day and 'we need to talk'. She feels she's being overly brutal and mean, and that it's coming from her bitterness towards her ex and just wants to be friends, but is open to 'seeing how things work in a couple of months if something happens organically', which I take to mean 'I'm not interested'.

We don't talk for a while, but recently been getting closer, hanging out a lot, and I feel like I'm getting mixed signals. She'll want to meet up and share a room with me (even though my snoring really bugged her), instead of sleeping downstairs, but at the same time it feels awkward and distant, and I can't help the fact that I still feel a lot for her.

Our job duties require us to share some of the computers/workstations - not ideal, but necessary given the specialized software/hardware we use. I occasionally share a workspace with a coworker we'll call Dave. Dave is a nice enough guy. Dave, however, has some serious personal hygiene issues. He smokes like a chimney (and smells like it) and constantly has a ""smoker's cough"" and sneezes 2-3x per hour.

"AITA for hanging up keep out signs on my door?. (Throwaway just to be safe)

A little bit of backstory: My mom is a pretty explosive woman. If something riles her up she eventually starts screaming and crying, sometimes she throws things around, never at me though. I never really started rebelling when I hit my teen years until recently (I'm now 16). Though the only real ""rebelling"" I do/did was skipping school a few times and we already had a talk about that.

My mom almost never respects the few boundaries I set and so a few weeks ago I decided to hang out some ""Keep Out"" signs. My mom mostly ignored them and only responded with ""Well, I'm not *in* your room, am I?"" when I asked her to respect my signs the first time.

The second time I reminded her of the signs was last Sunday, when she came into my room and started chatting with me, even though I was *really* not in the mood for that. So when she said that I ""look really enthusiastic about your dad's presents"" (irony, obv.) I responded with a cold ""Well, I still have the signs up, don't I?""

At that she completely freaked out. She called me a ""stupid cow"" (German 1st grade insult, found that kinda funny) and then stormed out of my room, whining that she ""can't do this anymore"". Now to be fair, she probably had a stressed day from my close family being over for the 1st Advent Sunday.

After that, I didn't hear her anymore, so I assumed she had calmed down again. Nope. She then kicked my door, told me she did that because she ""wanted to see how that felt"" and tore my three signs down and threw them in my room.

What's sad about this, is that I spent a good 20 minutes on all of them combined, 10 of which were put into tracing a rose from my phone screen.

My dilemma is that some of these dogs are genuinely very nice, However there are also some that are plain mean/aggressive. In the past year I've even had two of them run up to me unleashed and bark at me which scared me shitless.

My dog was attacked unprovoked by one of these staffordshire terrier/pitt bull mixes last year. There are a lot of small dogs that live in the apartment complex and I don't want them having to deal with what I went through. However, I feel like if I report that there are dogs that violate the breed restriction then they'll crack down on the people with the nice dogs.

Would I be the asshole?
",Restricted doesn't mean banned. Just find out certain dogs and owners and report them. But to take down many would be an asshole move.,0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for looking up a girl I used to like on Facebook?. Thats basically the entire story. My GF went through my search history on Facebook and wasn't too happy about the fact that 5 weeks ago I looked up a girl I used to like on Facebook. I'll try to keep this entirely fact based without me putting a spin on it. But this girl I had a thing for but never acted on it because she had a BF. Ive never kissed her or gone out on a date or anything. That was about a year and a half ago. Fast forward to now and I'm a year and a quarter into my relationship with my current girlfriend. She is talking about how she deserves better and yada yada yada. 

This isn't really the first time this has happened either. I like to know where people, who were important in my past, are at now. She asks me exactly who every single girl I have on social media is and what our relationship was etc. I have to be interrogated on my entire social media follow page. I have never once had a lock on my phone, unlike her. I've given her my passwords to most of my social medias.

So back to the current situation. Yeah, she's upset because I looked up a girl I liked before I started dating my current girl. I didn't message her, I didn't like her photos, and I didn't even add her as a friend. So AITA?",NTA- your girlfriend sounds really controlling and YOU seem like you deserve better,0,0,0,0,1

"AITA for excluding my daughter's father from doctors appointments?. My daughter has some kind of special needs. She has ADHD as diagnosed by her pediatrician and she has something else going on, likely a learning disability of some sort. We've been referred to a specialist clinic with a long waitlist. We finally got an appointment this October after someone cancelled, but I expected to wait until next spring. This appointment is to see if she will get further assessment for learning disabilities. It is critical to give the dr a clear picture. 

My daughters father doesn't think there's anything wrong with her. We're separated and have been for a while, we have a court order in place allowing me to make final decisions about medical, religious, education, etc. I've been concerned about my daughter for years. We've been on a long journey of ""she'll grow out of it"" and ""it's borderline"" and now she's in school and struggling. She needs some help and she needs a diagnosis to know what kind of help she needs. 

Her father thinks she just needs extra parenting and things will be fine. The last time we were at an appointment with a pediatrician together, he downplayed her symptoms and acted like she never does these things in his presence, which is nonsense. Her teachers, daycare, and other adults than me have all noticed and are concerned.

"AITA for not eating at my grandparents house after they commented on my weight gain?. I am 21F. I have struggled with weight problems my whole life. I am currently 5’10 and 135 pounds (this is the heaviest I have ever been). Just last year, I suffered from anorexia, and weighed 108 pounds at my lowest. I am recovering and gaininng weight. I feel incredibly fat and chubby, especially as I tend to store weight in my face and my legs. 

Yesterday, I was at my grandparent’s house with my family for dinner. Early on, my grandpa (who I had not seen for a few weeks) told me that I had “put on some weight”. He didn’t say it maliciously, but  I was really sad and was in a bad mood after that. He was right. I HAD put on weight.

My grandma had made this delicious elaborate dinner but I didn’t feel like eating any of it, although I was hungry. I basically ate some vegetables but didn’t touch any of the meat. My grandma kept insisting me to eat, but I couldn’t. Eventually I left the table.

Soon after, my mom found me and started yelling at me, calling me immature and sensitive and spoiled. She said I had hurt my grandparents feelings by not eating the food they had made so painstakingly. I said “maybe Grandpa shouldn’t have mentioned my weight.” She got even angrier and said I was being obtuse, that he meant it as a compliment and that he was just making an observation. She said that he knows about my previous struggles with weight, but in his mind he thought that mentioning I gained was a compliment to mean that I was getting healthier.

I apologized to my grandparents after, but I still didn’t eat. My grandma seemed quite sad and it definitely put a damper on the party. I felt like I had inadvertently drawn attention to myself. AITA?","NTA.  I'm so sorry you're treated this way.  5'10 and 135 sounds healthy to me, not at all overweight.

"AITA for cutting off a friend after he refused to apologize?. I had a friend, let's call him C. Now C and I have been friends for 4 years now. He lives in another city so we mostly played games together. However, there was a time where we were kind of trying to date, but that didn't work out so I broke it off. That was three years ago and all of that is now forgotten. 

He has always been difficult. He's had a rough childhood, he's stubborn and won't listen to anyone but himself. In those years, there were many fights that did not end because he just kept going and going even after I told him to stop discussing it(basically he does not understand what boundaries are). We have different views on almost everything, he also dismissed my anxiety when I opened up to him about 2 years ago, basically said all I have to do is work out and eat healthily and it will all go away. Now I have let those things slide because somehow we always found a way back and he was also my only friend who plays games so I needed him for that(or maybe that's an excuse and we were just in a toxic friendship).

Now a couple of weeks ago, we were playing and he called my BF a sissy (that's the best translation to English I could do from my native language). Since there have been a couple of times where he was also trying to disrespect my BF, but actually didn't go through with it, I reacted. Closed the game. He then wrote to me and asked what's wrong. I explained to him that I will not tolerate him disrespecting my BF and that I want him to apologize. He answered that ""I account being silent as admitting I fucked up"". What he meant by that is after calling my BF a sissy he instantly got quiet. I told him that it's not good enough and I expect him to admit he fucked up with words and apologize. He didn't.

Now fast forward a week and every time he contacts me, I tell him ""not good enough"". Nothing else, just that sentence. He finally understands that I'm not kidding and I will not talk to him unless he apologizes. He proceeds to tell that ""he feels like he didn't hurt anyone, so no need to apologize"". He also tells me ""it was clear that I was trying to make a joke and when you felt offended I stopped."" 

Like I wrote before, he has tried making ""jokes"" like that before but I always shut him down before. So he should know that I will not tolerate that. So basically we went back and forth by me telling him ""not good enough"" and explaining that I want him to apologize for dissing my BF and him telling me ""Too bad, that's all you get and it's more than necessary"". Since I have let his actions slide before I've had enough and put my foot down. Told him that if he does not apologize, I will not consider him my friend any longer. Then comes this sentence:

&#x200B;

""Not sure I want to. You felt disrespected by a thing that was not meant to hurt also I clarified it was not meant to hurt and now I have to apologize? Wow. And you talked about friendship or something.""

&#x200B;

Now the part where he says ""and you talked about friendship or something"" refers to a conversation we had a month ago when we were both feeling low, talking about it and trying to help one another. He opened up to me that he feels like he has no friends and I told him I consider him my friend. At this point, I'm starting to get tired because this is nothing new to us and those fight never end so I tell him that I made myself clear and will no longer continue with this discussion. He then tells me that ""I hope your boyfriend can tolerate you"" and that he was hoping our friendship will end with some big drama, not a little mistake.

&#x200B;

So, AITA for cutting him off?

&#x200B;

TLDR: A friend called my boyfriend a sissy(as an insult), refused to apologize because ""it was clear he was trying to make a joke"" and I cut him off after that.

imo, people! - if someone says you did something the other person doesnt like, or it bother/annoys/hurts the other person, even though you dont thinknit was wrong, just apologize and dont do it again. its hard to be always in the other person's shoes, but we have to try our best in order for relationships to be healthy",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for accepting a gift and then being creeped out after?. Hi guys, LTL and FTP, throwaway because I'd rather not have my identity on here in case this guy catches it. I'm female, this will be important.

So I recently went overseas for work, where I met this guy while checking in to my hotel. He's local to the area and after I complimented him on his shirt, because I genuinely thought it was a nice shirt, we chatted for a bit, like where I'm from and what I'm doing there, and he said he could tell me where I could buy shirts like his. I'm all for getting some wearable souvenirs so I accepted his offer, and he said he was in a rush and asked for my phone number to send me a message on the location and name of the place. He asked for a picture before he left, and since I'm a bit of a rare sight in his neck of the woods (an African in Russia) I agreed and he left.

Fast forward two days later, I get a call from him saying that he'll be delivering three shirts to my hotel and asked where I was staying. I thanked him again but it really wasn't necessary, he said they'd already been made according to the estimated proportions from the photo we took. So I told him where I was staying and the shirts were delivered. 

Since then, he's been texting me asking if we can meet up (he first texted me this at 10pm, asking if we could meet up later, I was creeped out already so I ignored it and replied the next morning saying that I slept early), when he can see me again, when I'll bring him around my home country in Africa. On my flight home he texted me to tell me to send a photo of myself in the plane and that he'd love to see me again.

"AITA for feeling relief after my gf’s miscarriage?. Me and my gf have been together for two years. The relationship have had its ups and downs and I am not sure I want to be with her in the long run.

She was supposedly on the pill, though now I suspect that maybe she was not. However I cannot prove it, though I found suspect that she told me after the miscarriage “I was so happy... we were finally moving in together. Now there’s nothing left to plan”. She seemed mostly sad about us not moving in together (though also for not having a baby). 

She desperately wants me to move in with her and I still don’t want to. Of course I would have to move in with her if she was still pregnant.

So this is what happened. Last week she told me she was late. We waited 3 more days and she took a pee test. Positive. I told her she should also have a blood text next day which was also positive. I told her I would stick with her because she was talking about a baby since one year ago and I knew she would never have an abortion, so I didn’t even considered it a real option and assumed that a baby was welcome if already on its way. But I was very scared, not properly excited about it and I was afraid that I would be unhappy because I have a feeling we won’t stay together on the long run and I don’t want kids with her. But I felt I had no other option since she really wanted the pregnancy. I would take responsibility and do the best I could.

The next day, she miscarried. She was devastated. I was not exactly devastated, though I felt sad. Sad about the situation, not exactly for the fact that she was not pregnant anymore. Sad because she was going through the entire morbid physical process. Sad because... I realized I actually WANTED that to happen. I never mentioned abortion to her and I really was going to stick to her, even against my own wishes because I didn’t want her to get pregnant in the first place. And finally... I felt relief. Of course I am still shocked, and still a bit sad (though I really didn’t want this pregnancy to evolve), but mostly relieved. Of course I am supporting her in all ways I can, took some days off work to be there for her because it is also my responsibility that she’s going through this. But I do not regret that she miscarried... though it makes me sad.

AITA for feeling relief? AITA for not feeling the need to mourn? Is it ridiculous that I feel sad about feeling relief?

"AITA for “disowning” my half siblings?. My biological dad decided to start another family since him and my mother have not been together since before I was born. I get along with him but for the most part we’re distant due to a troubled history in my childhood. As far as I’m concerned my step dad is really who is my dad since he stepped up when my bio dad did not. My stepdad held me first, quit drinking and quit using drugs when I was born. On the other hand my bio dad abandoned me even before I was born and didn’t acknowledge me until I was 8.

Years pass by and like most young people in my situation I got curious about who he was and at this time the custody battles had ended. I was now on 70/30 visitation with my mom receiving the majority. Gradually me and my bio dad became akin to friends more than father/son since he would get me in the summer months. Things went on like that until I was in my mid teens when I started staying with my mom more. This is when he met his current wife and they had 2 children.

Recently he had asked me to come visit for their birthdays and a few holidays but I declined. When faced with this his response was to say “They are your brother and sister, it’s really sad you would turn back on family like this.” To which I responded “Honestly we may be family by shared parent but I really don’t see them as my brother and sister.” This seem to really hit a nerve and after that he stopped talking to me.

"AITA for not paying rent?. Some context, I'm at my bf's a lot, to the point where I cook, clean, buy groceries, etc for them. I don't mind, because I always considered it my form of payment for staying over so much. Their mother is out of town for a few years due to work so I kind of took over as ""lady of the house"". I've also spoken to their mom and asked if she needed help with any of the bills, that I would be happy to take one of them off her plate (she got a pay cut recently) and she rejected me, saying that I've been doing enough.

In comes bf's brother, I'll be frank, I don't like him one bit. I think he's lazy, entitled, selfish, and incompetent. Not once, has he offered to pay for groceries, but he has no problem eating the ones I've bought. Not once has he helped me with any chores, despite being the one to complain about how dirty the house is. He honestly cannot do the simplest thing without asking how to do it (prolonged dealing with a claim on an accident because he couldn't bother to flip through the packet and sign the highlighted parts). He also asks me for rent because I'm over so much, even after bf has told him that I've spoken with their mom about that. He always says that he has school work to avoid helping around the house but we hear him playing games in his room (he's a yeller). And once, I worked in the morning, deep-cleaned the house, and was feeling hungry for not eating all day, I asked bf to pick me up something since he was out picking up his brother anyway. On the way back bf told brother that they were picking something up for me and brother asked ""Why?"" In the ""why the frick should we spend OUR money on HER"" way. My bf answered, ""You know, she does a lot for us, we can at least do this much and show our appreciation."" To which brother said ""*I* DO appreciate her"" I kind of just rolled my eyes when my bf told me this. 

One day, I'm chilling out because it's one of my rare days off of work and I thought I deserved it, so did my bf as he didn't really bug me and just let me relax. I call up a friend and ask her if she wanted to come over for dinner (I asked my bf beforehand and he said it was fine since it was only one friend). So she comes over and picks me up so I can buy some groceries.

"AITA for calling Christianity a cult?. I (25f) grew up in a very very strict religious household. Quite literally our family was part of a cult by definition. 

I got out very early on, it was obviously wrong to me. Recently my mother got out and she also refers to the religion as a cult. 

Onto the dilemma, I live in and work in Texas for a very large company. We have quite a few religious people and it's a common topic to come up at company outings. People asking what religion people have and talking about it.

I do not want to make anyone mad, so when asked these questions I just say ""I am not religious and would rather avoid discussing it as I grew up in a cult that harmed me in many ways."" So I do not name the religion or any details.

This does not happen often, as I generally do not talk to anyone, even at these outings. However recently one of my coworkers seemed interested in the response and asked me what sort of things we're bad and what was harmful in the cult.

I mentioned that they taught that women were not people but property, and should be less than men. As well as things like gay people should be killed (I am bisexual) and in their religion were even destroyed with fire and brimstone. And that anything bad was all just gods plan. So growing up around that, I had many issues. I was told constantly I would go to hell for simply finding other women attractive. I would be told I wasn't allowed to be smarter than the boys or be the leader in any situation. And probably the most harmful to me was that my parents refused to get me help with my autism and ADHD because it was gods plan. 

He seems to have figured out that I was talking about Christianity I guess?. Since this he has seemed upset at me and told me that I was not in a cult. But I was? 

AITA for calling it as such? Did I do something else wrong here?

Edit: I do not appreciate the few of you that are trying to invalidate my experienced due to my lack of knowledge on the subject of Christianity. Religion is something I have actively avoided since I left this chapter of my life. Social interaction are another thing I actively avoid due to my lack of understanding of what is acceptable.

"AITA for not going to see my dad on his anniversary?. A bit of background. My dad and his wife have been together for 18 years (ish) they married 9 or 10 years ago just after my nans birthday. They split up 2 years ago and got back together this year. I have never particularly liked this woman and as the years have gone on, I have liked her less and less for various reasons. My dad is fully aware of this, but I have always tried to be polite and respectful.

So, my nans birthday fell on a Tuesday this year and I was working so I decided to go and see her on the Thursday which happened to be my dad's anniversary. I took presents to my nans house for her birthday along with my daughter who had also brought gifts.

We weren't able to stay long as it's a 2 & a half hour drive each way. So I stayed for maybe 2 hours then left to go home.

I did the same thing this weekend as my nan has been poorly with gastroenteritis. It is important to note that I had left my daughter with a friend for the day as I didn't want her to get what my nan had, so I couldn't spend longer than 2 hours there. My nan is the main carer for my 90 year old grandad who has dementia so I decided I would go and help her out a bit around the house to take the edge off. Halfway there I got a text from my dad to say that my nans sister had died so I phoned him to check he was ok, and told him I was on my way to nans. He didn't say anything about it, the call was pleasant enough so I didn't think about it.

Anyway, I get to my nans and my step mum is there, she leaves almost as soon as I arrive and I ask her if dad is home, she told me he was and I asked her to say hello to him for me. She seemed a little annoyed that I wasn't going over to see him myself and I told her that I didn't have long as I had to get back to my daughter.

My nan shook her head and when my step mum had left, she told me I was going to be in trouble because I hadn't gone over there on his anniversary (I assumed he'd be working as well as me not having time) and I wasn't going there again today.

My argument is that my dad knew I was going to my nans at the weekend, he could have come over. And as for not visiting on their anniversary, I don't think I should have to? I went to see my nan for her birthday, I didn't check to see if he was working or not but I have never celebrated anyone elses anniversary other than my own. Unless of course its a very big one and there's a party!

Also worth mentioning, my dad forgot about my first wedding anniversary this year - I also must add that this is NOT the reason I didn't visit him. I didn't really care that he'd forgotten as it isn't out of character for him to forget these things.

"AITA for not wanting to talk about Hong Kong with my native Chinese friend?. For background, I was born in China, but was adopted as an infant by a white family. I have little knowledge of Chinese culture or language and never really ""felt"" Chinese.

Not long after, my friend texted me a fairly long rant about how they don't like how US media is portraying the situation, saying, ""the way US writes the issue just makes me so fucking mad"" and how the US ""just thinks it's China doing bad well no it's not!!!!"".

I replied, ""...I considered blocking u from seeing my story because you're my friend and I don't want to argue about this with u! We are primed to hold different opinions from the start and I don't wanna fight about it"".

At the time, I meant ""I value our friendship more than a political argument that is bound to end up as an actual fight"" and ""I'm not going to try to convince you to turn against your home country, but I would rather you not try to convince me to take China's side"".  

However, upon re-reading, I can see how what I said can easily be misconstrued as ""I refuse to change my opinion and I don't want to hear your point of view"". And I realize that me admitting I wanted to block them from seeing my #FreeHongKong post didn't help.

We agreed to drop the topic, but they were unusually cold to me afterwards and now we haven't texted/interacted on social media for a longer than usual time.

I feel like I sounded like the typical close-minded American who immediately thinks China=communist baddies, but I also believe China really is the bad guy in this situation.

"AITA for not accepting money from my parents?. I go to uni in the UK and I’m in my second year. I barely get student finance because my parents earn a fair amount of money but I can barely afford to pay rent. I managed to pay for last year and half of this year with savings from part-time jobs but at this point I’m penniless. The only reason I can afford to stay in uni is because my godmother gives me some money every month for tutoring her grandson. 

My parents don’ financially support me in the slightest. I understand why to a point, I’ve got three other siblings and they have been travelling abroad a lot over the past few years to visit my grandad who has dementia. However, they have no problem going out for dinner up to four times a week and recently gave my brother £4000 out of £6000 for a school trip to China.

Most of my friends have lectures maybe three days a week but I’m in every day and spend my weekends reading and doing weekly assignments so I don’t have time for a job. There have been times where I’ve had such little money I’ve almost resorted to drug dealing. My parents have only given me money once and that was £20 for a phone bill because they were worried when I wasn’t answering their texts because I couldn’t afford to pay the bill myself. Just recently, I had to beg them to help me pay my rent because it cost more than the finance I received for the semester. They said no and I had to borrow from a friend.

Last week was my birthday. I spent it by myself, in my room, literally eating baked beans for the third day in a row and it was miserable. The next day I got a card from them with a cheque for £1000.

I was absolutely floored. At first I was relieved but then I just got angry because all this time they’ve said they can’t afford to help me with rent, food, school books, all stuff that I’ve really needed and haven’t been able to pay for without bankrupting myself. I still haven’t cashed it, I need the money but I’m so angry I think about ripping it up every time I look at it. My dad phoned me two days ago and asked if it had gone through and I told him basically what I’ve just said above and asked how they were able to give me this now when they couldn’t help at all when I genuinely needed it. He told me I was being stupid, if I needed the money that badly I would take it and didn’t understand that wasn’t the point. He also accused me saying I’d have more money if I didn’t spent it all on going out which is completely false because I don’t go out at all and haven’t done since the first week of first year. I hung up on him and refused to answer when he tried to phone me back.

I’ve spoken to a couple of people about this already and I’m getting mixed opinions. The most common one is that they get why I’m upset but also I should take the money. Even if I do cash the cheque, most of it will go towards paying my friend back and I’ll be back at square one.","NTA... but you're an idiot if you don't cash that.

"AITA for not going to my nephew's kindergarten graduation and getting angry?. Sorry for the length.

This involves me (20F) and my older sister (28F), and also my brother (16M). I live a few states away, but she has two young kids and hasn't seen me or our younger brother in a while, so she invited me and him to come and stay with her for a few months. I've been here about a month so far. She's the type of person to want someone around and doing everything with her 24/7. I am the opposite, but I've tried participating in all the things they do even though it's all wildly different from what I enjoy.

A few days ago I started feeling sick. It started with a sore throat and has moved to my sinuses. I've been taking some medicines to help with the symptoms. Last night was a terrible night. The pressure went away, but I had to keep getting up and getting tissue to blow it out, but it just kept on. On top of it, I have asthma that was irritated by me being sick already, so last night I used my inhaler more than once which tends to make me shake and gives me energy. It was around 6 AM before I finally got to bed.

This morning was my nephew's graduation from kindergarten at 9AM and we had to leave by 8:40. My sister tried waking me up a few times but I didn't get up. My brother woke up and asked me if I was OK, and I explained to him that I wasn't feeling up to going and asked him if he could let our sister know when she was out of the bathroom getting ready. I went back to sleep.

My brother told me later that he started explaining it to her, but she walked away from him and went outside. 5 minutes later he heard her come back in and go to the room I'm in. She wakes me up and angrily says, ""Seriously? You're not going to the graduation?"". I realize I probably could have handled this better, but in the moment I was just so tired and I assumed she had already had the explanation as to why I wasn't going to go. So I got up angrily and said something like, ""Fine. I've gotten like two hours of sleep, I'm sick and having trouble breathing. Give me a minute and I'll get ready."" I was short and mean, and then I stomped off and went into the bathroom.

A minute later she knocks on the door and says, ""Now our brother is out back crying his eyes out, just go back to bed."" I exit the bathroom and she goes into her room and slams the door before I can even see her. I said something like, ""I don't know how that's my fault, but whatever."" and went back to bed. Later on, my brother explained to me that he had cried because he was angry with my sister for not listening to him earlier and then coming and waking me up to make me feel guilty. 

I feel sort of like an asshole for the way I reacted, but at the same time I feel like I never said anything hurtful to her and I don't normally ever react that way, but I was tired and sick and I already felt guilty about missing his day. He doesn't seem to be upset by it, though. Before I sit down and talk to her, I'd like an objective opinion on who is the asshole here.",It's... A graduation for kindergarten.

"AITA for ignoring neighbor kids that show up at my door on Christmas day unannounced?. Title is a bit broad. My family has a household of 7 kids next door to us. Since they moved in about five years ago, the two middle kids have taken a liking to me (female, 20 btw). I'm okay with it. Before I went to college, I used to take them on adventures and walks around the neighborhood and the older one would talk to me about boys. I enjoy hanging out with them... *when I'm not busy*. And when they ask first.

I don't exactly remember when it started, but they ring my doorbell unannounced all the time now. Except they also like my dad, since he's great with kiddos, so they do it all year round, not just when I'm home from college. They will come over at random times in the afternoon, at least once a week, just to talk for a few minutes or dig around our stuff. 

Often times, they let themselves into our entryway before my dad can say we're busy. He lets them play with our dog and leave. He also tells them that my mom doesn't like guests unannounced, and that usually I'm gone or we're busy. So they know, it's not like no one ever told them.

A lot of the time we're asleep (active family, take a lot of naps). My dad has told them many times ""OP can't come talk because she's asleep but I'll let her know you stopped by"". So they *know* that most of the time I'm asleep or busy. I don't understand why they keep coming over.

My biggest problem with this is that it's unannounced. The oldest one (12) texts me occasionally. Last week, she said, ""I want to see you before you go back to college!"" I replied, ""yeah!"" and she didn't respond. No kids at my door or text from then until today. So I figured they were busy with holiday stuff and she would at least text before heading over.

Instead they show up at my door on Christmas day, when my whole family is asleep including my sick mom who didn't sleep last night. Also, it's Christmas. Even if we were awake, who just shows up at someone's house unannounced on Christmas? 

They left (after waking my mom and loud dog up), only to come back just now as I'm typing this (again unannounced, an hour later). 

I'm kind of feeling asshole-ish because it's Christmas and we should be caring and kind to our neighbors, and the season is about spending time with the ones you love. I love the holiday season and seeing people happy.

But then I remember it's Christmas day and I had kids at my door at a random hour, unannounced, while the whole house is asleep. 

My dad thinks I'm TA for not being ""kind to the kids"" on Christmas, which I understand. But I'm not so sure because IMO, it's rude. But I'm kind of confused and I'd like an outside opinion if I'm being an asshole on Christmas.

So, AITA?

(Also, for reference, the second time they showed up I was awake, so I hung out with them outside and they showed me their Christmas presents. I may be an asshole (that's why I'm posting), but I'm not a complete dick to little kids.)","These are children, whose parent is lazy or ignorant. I have had similar situations, unfortunately. You have to become the ""parent"" of this situation, by beginning to put some rules in place. It won't help for this Christmas, but you can make it a better situation by next year.

"AITA for refusing to change my shirt?. This is going to sound petty bc it absolutely is.

For the longest time, my sister has been embarrassed by my and my brothers outfit choices if she doesnt like them, and refuses to go out in public with us unless we change or hide it, and if we dont, ahe gets very pissy with us and it ruins the night.

Recently i bought this tank top - black and white cheeta print with Spongebob and Patrick on it. I normally do not wear tank tops at all since I'm very self conscious about the way i look, but i bought it because I thought it was cool. When i did, my sister expressed that she thought it was ugly but nothing more. A few days after buying it, we're heading out for the night and I was confident for a change and put it on. Immediately, my sister complains about it. How its ugly and she refuses to go out with me because it embarrasses her.

I see her side. She doesnt want people to look at her and judge her, and she said this shirt is basically rolling her anxieties into one thing. But I also see my side. I was trying to be comfortable in the hot weather, thought I looked good, and felt I had a right to wear it since I think its lowkey total BS I have to bend over backwards to make her happy.

The conversation made me cry, and I ended up taking it off after overthinking and making myself believe I was ugly. Its been a few weeks, and Ive only worn it like 2 other times, either only wearing it in the house or covering it up with a jacket. But I truly dont think I have to be doing this.

"AITA for staying silent after feeling insulted by a guest in my house?. I called a ""friend"" in the morning to plan a small gathering with our own daughters. She would pick us up at my daughter's school then buy something to go and eat it at my place.

This friend knows where I live and she even knows one of my neighbors, an old lady who dislikes me profoundly and with whom I've had several problems about parking distribution and littering the street with her lawn cuts. Fortunately, this neighbor recently put her house for rent and we have new neighbors with whom I'm respectful and try to avoid any problem similar to those that I had with the house owner.

And here's the problem: we got to my house after buying food and I asked my friend to park her car in a different place than where she intended. I asked her twice, very politely and mentioning the problems I had in the past with the bitch neighbor I mentioned earlier, to park her car in front of my house so I could avoid any possible situation with the tenants. Well, she said she would ask another neighbor (one that had nothing to do with the parking space). I asked her for a third time to not do it and park in front of my house. She minimized my request and parked not only in the tenants' parking space, but also invading the space of a third neighbor.

I kept silent while she walked to my house and before entering my home I asked her politely to move her car. She said she had asked the third neighbor about using that parking space and the neighbor said that he'd call me if they were using the space or needed her to move the car. I asked her if she was not moving her car and she said: NO. That was my fifth attempt and I was about to explode, so I decided to do the opposite, I kept completely silent.

We sat down and ate but I kept the conversation to an absolute minimum. Only thanked and asked for food and that was it. She noticed my glacial silence and tried to speak only with the kids but when she tried to share an anecdote and she asked me something, I said nothing. Apparently she understood and hurried up their meal, put their plates in the sink and left saying a brief goodbye.

After they left, I apologized to my daughter because she wanted to play with this friend's daughter, but I explained her that this is not the first time she has dissed me and my house rules. She answered that she also dislikes some of her attitudes toward her friend and her. I asked her to try to keep things separate and don't let my own struggles contaminate her relations and friendships.

Now, I'm at my home, wondering if this issue of someone disrespecting my house rules is too much and I was the asshole in this situation.

"WIBTA if I asked to stay home this Christmas.. On mobile, throwaway, yada yada 

Since my grandma on my mom's side passed we've gone to my grandma's house on my dad's side every year. The thing is, I can't stand this woman. 

I've always felt like the least favorite grandchild on this side of the family. I'm a completely different person from my family (in the sense of interests) except for my aunt. I always feel excluded and like they completely forget about me 99% of the time. With most of my family it's not too noticable, but not with my grandma. 

Some examples of events that make me feel this way in the last 3 years include: 

-her allowing my cousin who is 2 months younger than me to sit at the adult table but tell me I had to sit at the kids table because ""they need a good role model"" 

-giving me a $10 Walmart gift card every birthday since I turned 5 but actually going out and buying my other cousins gifts. 

-When we do gift exchanges she'll group me with the younger kids but let 2 of my younger cousins go into a higher age group, I never end up with an age appropriate gift. (I'm 16F btw and during said exchange I got a slinky and was yelled at for being ungrateful) 

-the Christmas gifts, oh God, the gifts. Every year I'll give her a detailed list of what I want (all the grandkids do this) but she won't get me a single thing off it. In most cases I'd be grateful I got something but ALL of these gifts feel like she put 0 effort in or just plain forgot to get me something and ran to the drug store and grabbed the first thing she saw. Some of the gifts include: 
         -an eyeshadow palette (I'm not aloud to wear makeup, she knows this) 
         - a car tree
         - a jacket that was 3 sizes too small 
         - a pre-school activity book (I was 14) 
         - a pocket Bible (I asked for scary movies and she told me I needed something more ""age appropriate"") 
         -and worst of all, I asked for Funko Pop figures and she bought me a hoodie that was probably an XXXL that was white (I HATE the color white and she knows this) that said ""bride boss"" in big pink letters. 

She always uses the excuse that she doesn't know what anything on my list is. Every year I tell her to ask my aunt or me to clarify. I'm sick of the embarrassment of unwrapping something awful while the rest of my family gets highly expensive and nice gifts, the year I got the hoodie mentioned above she got my 10 y/o cousin an PS4.

"AITA For not wanting a relationship with my sister?. First off this is my first post on reddit so please go easy. 

My sister is a piece of work. She’s been to jail, did/does drugs (don’t really know at this point), continues to stay with a horrible guy and doesn’t do what it takes to care for her children. My biggest problem is that she’s a mom but doesn’t act like one. She got pregnant at a young age so didn’t finish high school. She blames our mom for everything wrong in her life. I’ve had enough of seeing our mom cry over an ungrateful person and I know my mom cares but there’s only so much she can do. My mom has done everything she could for my sister, sending money, buying clothes for her girls, buying all the Christmas presents and even giving her my old vehicle (without my permission, it was exploding coolant everywhere and I had gotten a new one but still it was mine.)

"AITA (are we the assholes) for distancing ourselves from a friend who lied about abuse and other things?. TL;DR. Would my friends and I be the assholes after cutting out an extremely emotionally needy person who has been proven to lie about some things?


A couple months ago one of my close friends started talking constantly about depression and harming himself. For months we stayed up until 2 am talking to him, walking through his problems. We tried our hardest to get him help but he would never listen. 

He then started talking about abuse, his parents emotionally and physically beating him, and how he felt so low. My friends and I believed he was depressed, but never believed the abuse part. We have been friends since 2nd grade, and his parents have never been abusivo in our presence. Even over discord calls when he would hide his phone because it’s late, they would always tell him how much they love him, we would see them at restaurants in public.

Then a month ago, we learned he had been manipulating three girls at our school into basically giving him stuff for free because of the “abuse”. They called CPS and CPS investigates his house. To this day, his only evidence of abuse is a patched hole in his wall. He says his dad threw a lamp at the wall, but the lamp supposedly thrown has a large base and the hole was small. He constantly changes his story also, at one point saying his dad pinched the hole.

We were still planning on hanging out with him, as we thought the depression just clouded his mind. Then, one of our friends girlfriends started receiving weird texts from him, very frequently. Telling her how good her art is, how amazing she is, how lucky our friend is to be dating her. Then he starts ranting to her also. 
Our friend told him to stop texting his girlfriend, and he told him to shut up and called him an asshole. That’s when we decided to stop hanging out with him, but it gets worse.

He decided to try and get CPS to take him and his sisters to a foster home, bombarding them with calls. He tried to tell us that foster homes are amazing, and that’s why he was doing it. We didn’t care, if he wanted to do that to himself sure, but his sisters didn’t want to go. One of his sisters is autistic too, which is even worse. He refused, and kept calling them. They never had enough evidence to take them.

One of my friends recently hung out with him and watched the punisher, and he texted him later saying “When we were watching the punisher some of the scenes.. idk how to describe it.. it.. reminded me of some things” We don’t know if he means he cut himself or he’s been thinking of doing something to our school, but the school never listened whenever we brought stuff to them.

So basically I’m asking, would my friends and I be the assholes if we cut him out after months of trying to help him? I just feel so drained, as this is the only thing he talks about when we are with him.

Long story short, things ended on not such a good note but we wanted to keep things civil.  Most of everything was either hers or mine but there were a few things we bought together that we let each other have if we wanted it to make things easier. After she moved out I told her I would keep a few things since where she was moving was such a tiny place. I asked her if she wanted it the TV and she said “If you still have it by the time i move again i can take it off your hands.” I agreed. 

One month after we broke up she is already with someone else. One month. Along with my disdain toward her I was already fed up with holding on to her shit. In my head I thought “I’m not a storage unit why should I keep it for your convenience?” so one day i packed up a lot of it and hauled to her house. She was not very pleased but at the time I could of cared less. We didn’t speak for months.

"AITA for yelling at someone for breaking something I got on Christmas despite the fact that they’re putting it together for me?. So my stepdad and I were putting together a TV cabinet. I was trying to go step by step, while he just wanted to do it in a way that “makes sense”. When he tipped it over to put something on that should have been there 3 steps ago, he broke the hinge on both doors. This isn’t a normal hinge, and I’ve never seen anything like it in stores. 

I said “hey you broke this” expecting a simple “sorry” but instead he said “no I didn’t” so I said “yes you did, can I just get an apology” so then he said “fuck off, you’re being so dramatic” and it went back and forth for a while of me asking him to admit what he did, and him cursing at me. 

Now, despite being an adult, my parents still don’t allow me to curse in front of them no matter the reason. No matter if it’s at them, at me, at nothing, if I’m quoting something, if I’m singing a song, if I read something that sounds like a curse word, etc. I’m just not allowed and it doesn’t matter to them the context. But I was getting real tired of him cursing at me, telling me to fuck off, calling me names, etc. so I finally said “how about you stop fucking cursing at me.

A little background: my uncle (35) is the second oldest of three siblings. My dad (47) being the oldest. My dad came to America in his twenties and much later brought my uncle because my uncle wanted to come live here. We come from a communist country so yeah. 

My uncle has had at least 3 wives and has cheated on all of them. Every single one, including the one who gave birth to his son.  Fast forward to 2016 ish. He’s married but he’s coming to America. His new wife (33) wasn’t given a visa yet so she couldn’t come at the same time. It took her about a year to get the visa to come. Within that year where my uncle was alone he began a series of affairs that honestly I wish I was kidding. All while He would send emails to his wife saying that he missed her etc. 

Everyone in the family knew this. Every single person and said nothing because as my mom says “it’s not our business”. To be honest I almost sent my aunt an email spilling everything to her but I was stopped from doing so by my mom and my own fear. 

When my aunt came to America, he apparently stopped. He started being faithful and coming home on time etc. Until about two weeks ago. He keeps asking for my grandad to cover for him and tell my aunt he’s working late and has been spotted with multiple girls. My aunt is literally one of the sweetest ppl I know and she basically loves my uncle with her whole heart. She left her entire country and everything she knows to be with him in America. It would break her heart but still. She deserves better

"AITA for refusing to fire our maid (at my wife's request). **

I guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. So before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. Honestly thought my marriage was perfect I never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.

--- 

My wife and I have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. My wife is a stay at home mom while I work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. 

We live in Hong Kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. Our maid is a 34 year old Filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. She lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. 

The problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. She hasn't given any specific reason other than ""I don't want a maid anymore."" I honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but I don't want to fire her because:

- She has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point

- She relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it

- We still have an infant/young children that require constant attention

- I work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. My wife doesn't cook nor clean so I am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone

The woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and I don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.

I'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. Jealousy does not seem to be the case here.

On Sunday morning, we started walking to our car and he proposed we should take our daughter to the park. I agreed  that  it doesn't really matter to me where we spend time together. However, he spent the entire time on the phone. First he kept texting  his mom. Then, he spent a little part of time on reddit while I ran around after the baby. Then, he called his uncle! He has not called this particular uncle in months. They had a long conversation lasting more than 30 mins. All this time, he just walked around the outer perimeter of the park.

"AITA for not letting my neighbour into our apartment block because she forgot her key?. I moved into gated apartments 6 weeks ago and we all have our own access key to get in. The doors require a little magnetic button that you press against the door, and it’ll open but we are told to close the doors after us each time. 

There are cameras that record people going through and there are polite bolted signs at every entrance and exit reminding people to use their own access key and not to shunt through after someone in front of you, as well as people going through MUST shut the door after entry or exit.  When I moved here and was given the walk through I was told failure to comply would result in eviction. 

I was walking into the apartments when I noticed a not immediate neighbour behind me. She had no keys in her hands, and had a LOT of Sephora/Nike/etc bags. She was huffing behind me in a way to suggest she was trying to catch up to me. I ALWAYS shut the door behind me, regardless of if there’s someone behind me or not. That’s the rules, and I’m not trying to get kicked out the apartments. so I did that this time and shut the door, and right as I reached the elevator I heard the most loud smashing behind me.

Of course I jerked around to see what was making the noise and it was woman ‘knocking’ on the door. She gestured to me to open it, and I shook my head no and said sorry and pointed to the sign where it clearly said the rules.

"AITA for not giving a homeless person their money?. Im on mobile so sorry if the text isn’t easy to read. 

I work at a convenience store in a area where there are frequent homeless people hanging out outside or passing by the store all the time. If they aren’t causing trouble I don’t ever ask them to leave. 

Well this one guy asked a woman for money because he was hungry. She came in the store and bought a 10$ gift card and asked me to hold it for him. She said she was going to send him in to buy some food with it, but if he tried to buy alcohol or cigarettes she wanted me to basically refuse the sale. She didn’t stick around, she just left after that. 

The guy came in and told me a woman said she left some money for him and he’d like to purchase some cigarettes. I didn’t know what to do! I didn’t feel right that he lied to her, but at the same time it’s not like she was going to come back for the money. I told him “Yeah she loaded this gift card with 10$ but told me she wants you to use it to buy some food or drinks.” 

He got upset with me, mumbled some stuff under his breath and proceeded to purchase the pack of cigarettes with a 20$ bill he already had and he then left. 

I feel like I did the wrong thing because at the end of the day that money isn’t going to be used and it just going to get credited to the store. But I see this happen so many times where homeless people ask for money and refuse food because what they really want is alcohol and cigs. 

Should I just have let him buy the cigarettes as the money wouldn’t be returned to the customer? 

I want to add I feel like I am not in a position to hold anyone accountable as I’m just a store clerk cashier and I felt like I was overstepping my authority or maybe I’m just thinking about it too much.

"AITA For Not Changing My Cat Name For My Offended Neighbor?. I saw a similar post here a while ago and I feel like sharing mine too, though I think it's not that much of a deal.


I have recently moved in to an apartment with my boyfriend and my 2 year old black cat, Lucifer. Despite naming him Lucifer we also call him Lucy and Lulu. Some of the friendly neighbors visited our place with gifts as a welcome gesture and it did not take long for us to know that one of their 7 year old daugher's name is Lucy. 


The mother(who did not visit our place before and probably heard from the other neighbors) had been knocking our door asking us to change the name of our cat because

1. They are christians, and linking my cat name ""Lucifer"", which we also nickname ""Lucy"" to their daughter ""Lucy"" is offensive.

2. The cat is black, the little girl is black too, thus racist.


I declined her request as my cat was named even before we moved in, so it was just a coincidence that their names were similar. Whats more, my cat is a strictly indoor cat and nobody would probably hear me calling him ""Lucy"" or ""Lucifer"" outside our apartment, in fact nobody would have known that we owned a cat.


The neighbor is getting rather upset over this and even my boyfriend said that changing Lucifer's name is not a big deal, we could even lie to her that we have already changed his name. I said no, why should I change my cat's name or lie about him changing name when it is really none of her business? I don't want to give in to her over such silly reasons. AITA?

"AITA for cutting a sleepover short over a doll?. A little bit of backstory and throwaway account to avoid the coworker seeing this.

I was raised alongside my best friend as our mothers grew up together. I trusted this man with my life and he always came through for me. He was the godfather of my three children and I'm the godmother of his two .Three years ago, he passed away in a car accident but before he did he left my daughter (then 11, now 14) an American girl doll that looked like her. She doesn't like dolls, hates them actually and was planning on giving it to her cousin but when she found out her godfather died, she kept it. It sits in it's box on a shelf in her room and anyone who comes into her room gets told not to touch multiple times. Even her brothers won't touch it when they're trying to piss her off because she will break down.

Now that the backstory is out of the way, here's the situation. 

My coworker (Myra) wanted a weekend to herself and asked if her daughter( 13, Stacy) could have a sleep over with my daughter, Grace(14), I agreed. My sons had to go to their grandmother's house along with our dog before Stacy could come over and Grace wasn't really wanting a sleepover but was convinced into doing it by one of her friends. Stacy got told the rules of Grace's room which included not touching her doll. Everything was hunky dory until Saturday night when Grace found Stacy playing with her doll after she went to the bathroom. An argument ensued that ended with Stacy throwing the doll on ground and storming out. 

Luckily, the floor was carpet and the doll was okay but Grace was bawling her eyes out. I called Myra and told her I'd be taking home Stacy early because of what happened and when I was dropping her off, Myra was pissed but said nothing about it. I thought she was upset her weekend was ruined but understood. 

Well when I came into work on Tuesday( I had Monday off), apparently Myra had told everyone in the office that I had kicked her daughter out for playing with a toy my daughter said she could play with. I was able to explain my side of the story but people still think we (Me and Grace) overreacted by kicking her out. Am I the Asshole here or just overreacting. 

Edit- A word

"AITA for wanting a little more space? Am I asking for too much space?. I grew up in a culture where it’s pretty normal to show physical affection to your family. Spending time with family means lots hugs and kisses and a lot of pressuring your kids to give hugs to people that they don’t really want to. Family members are often very close to each other.

While I have no problem with physical contact, I do believe that bodily autonomy, consent, and boundaries are very important. I’ve been dealing with a lot of mental health issues since childhood and sometimes I just can’t deal with being touched or spoken to for periods of time. It freaks me out and it feels uncomfortable and I can’t figure out why. I’m pretty vocal when my mother does something that makes me uncomfortable, but she often guilt trips me by saying that I don’t ever give her attention or just continues to do whatever it was I asked her to stop doing. The only time she listens is when I have full-blown panic attacks, which I am grateful for because it makes them worse. 

Sometimes she will try to hug me or give me a kiss on the cheek. Not a big deal, but sometimes I really just need everyone to stand like 2 feet away from me and let me do what I’m doing. 

She often enters my room without knocking, sometimes the bathroom if I’m in the shower and  she needs to tell me something. I know she’s the person who changed my diapers and taught me how to dress myself, but I’m 24 and I just don’t like anyone barging in while I am naked. I understand if she needs to tell me something she has to come to my room or closer to the shower so that I can hear her, but can’t it wait? On the other hand, I know that I spend an awful lot of time in my room lately and if I really need to be alone for days on end that can probably make someone feel unloved.

I do love my mom and I try to tell her as often as I can, but she takes it as an insult if I want a little bit of space from people. In her mind she’s not “people,” she’s “mom.” But when I say people, I really do mean everybody within 10 feet of me. That said, I feel really guilty that I can’t make her feel as appreciated as I should.","NTA

We are student workers, our bosses trusted us to go to this conference, and the student (call her L) that arranged the trip (bed and board, etc.) was specifically commissioned to go so she could make a presentation on what she learned. The conference could potentially open up new opportunities for the student-workers, and those who went were offered an entire week’s pay. 

Two coworkers and I drove 1 hour and 30 minutes from our school to meet the four coworkers (including L) at the conference. After the keynote and the introduction to the conference, L told us that our AirBnB was cancelled.

"Aita for being upset my boyfriend didn’t defend me?. Backstory: My mother is a massive Star Wars geek. I’m talking owning the original collectible toys from when episodes 4-6 came in theatres. For her 45th birthday, I decided to have some fun and bought her a bunch of gag gifts as fandom merch. They were dumb useless stuff but she had a great laugh over them. I also bought my dad a gift voucher for something on his bucket list for his birthday, a barista class, just for fun. 

The other night, my boyfriend and his mum were poking fun at my choices for gifts when his mum essentially joked that I’m well intentioned but I don’t really think when it comes to buying stuff. When my boyfriend told me about this I got upset because he just laughed along and let her hold this wrong impression of me that I’m a spoilt rich girl who doesn’t know how to manage money.

My boyfriend doesn’t think it’s a big deal and he doesn’t get why I’m upset he didn’t defend me and correct her. I don’t even mean in a serious way, just give her the full picture. 

I told him because I don’t want her having a negative impression of me; she generally likes me, or I’d like to think that she does. It’s not the joke that bothered me, because the gifts were supposed to be funny, But it seems like she just thinks I’m a little frivolous and careless when it comes finances.

"AITA for telling my GF I've stopped caring about her insecurities?. I already feel like a bit of an asshole but I'm not sure what else to do so I wanted reddits opinion.

A little backstory, my GF (28) and myself (34m) have been together for nearly 10 years now. Our relationship has been pretty solid up till the last few years where this problem started and has grown to being a nearly daily occurrence which is driving me mad. We met when I was just finishing university and she was just starting, we hit it off instantly and got serious pretty fast. It was a little weird as she was just starting full time studying and I was entering the workforce but we were really happy together. Fast forward to now and we own a home together and were talking about marriage/children until recently.

When we first met I was at my heaviest (300lb+) as full time studying and bad eating habits had caught up with me, she has pretty much stayed consistent with her weight since we met. A few years ago I decided I wanted to get back into the shape I used to be in, since then I've been pretty consistent with eating/working out and have dropped about 140lbs. this is something we've been doing together and she seemed pretty happy that we were both eating healthy. When I first started losing weight she used to occasionally joke about I would fine someone better looking than her but this has now grown to be part of most conversations we have.

At first I would just joke back that after being with her for so long it would be too much effort to find someone else to put up with me but as it became more constant I stopped doing that. I tried to reassure her how I wasn't interested in anyone else, how I loved her and that she was beautiful but it doesn't seem to make any difference. She will just bluntly state in both private and a public setting how she looks ugly compared to me and that everyone must wonder why I'm still with her and she wouldn't be surprised if I was cheating on her.

At this point I wasn't comfortable anymore with her openly saying that I was the type of person to cheat on her so we sat down and had a serious conversation about what I could do to change how she feels and if there was anything that I was doing to cause this. She said that it was nothing that I had done and this is just how she feels, I suggested that she could go talk to a therapist to work through her issues or we could go together to work on this but she declined that as well.

Last week was was my final straw when I got home from work late and the first thing she said to me was ""Oh so you'd rather spend time with your attractive coworker than come home to my ugly ass"" and I just snapped and replied ""I honestly don't care about how you feel anymore, this has been going on for over a year and you refuse to tell me what I can do any differently or help you work on this.

"AITA for giving flak to a relative who makes a big deal out of getting up early every day and then has to nap later in the day?. I never liked getting up early (that's any time before 7).  If I have to, I nap if I can.  I have a big extended family that often spends time together.   A few of them are like me: avoid early rising.  Others rise early and nap in afternoons.  No issue there.

But my brother in law has a big thing about getting up early.  He's regularly commenting about *Rise and Shine.*   He harasses his  kids about it, they reported to me. They say he gets annoyed at people sleeping in.  He even needles them for on weekends, when they have no school.  But he needs his daily nap!

On a recent extended family camping trip, he started needling me, teasing,  for getting up later than 7.  He did it to me 3 or 4 days in a row.  (I was initially unaware he napped.)   Then I caught him napping and made a big deal of it, in front of his kids.  I loudly proclaimed that anyone who does not have to get up early for a responsibility and just gets up at a normal time for themselves should be able to remain up all day.

"WIBTA if I told a woman that her boyfriend is having an affair with my mom?. My mom got together with a man while he was on a break with his long-time girlfriend. He and his girlfriend got back together, and he told my mom he'd prefer not to be involved with her now that he's back with his girlfriend. But my mom pulled the terminal cancer card and told him she needs his friendship and support in her life.

Well, long story short, they slept together, then promised never to do it again. But they fantasize together about secretly getting married without ever telling his girlfriend, and they sext often.

"AITA for slamming my front door in the morning to wake my neighbours up?. So backstory, I live in a house that's been converted into 2 apartments. I currently live in the top apartment, I have my own access to the property so I don't have to bother anyone when I'm coming home from work late or getting up early.

I moved into this place a few months back and at the start things were great, I talked with my neighbours and they seemed like nice people. However a week after moving in the partying began, I'm talking a party every 2-3 days. At first I just let them do it because I didn't want them to think bad of me early on and I thought maybe it's because it's summer and it'll stop after a week, it didn't.

A few weeks after that I changed roles at my job and that meant I had to start work at 6am. So every morning I would get up and go to work as I normally would. It only took a few days for them to come knock on my door and imo with an attitude tell me to stop slamming my door in the morning because it was waking them up. At first I was sympathetic and even though they didn't ask me nicely I agreed to be a bit quieter closing the door but I also explained that their partying until 5am was keeping me up and if they could keep the noise down, they agreed.

Apparently they didn't give a shit and still continued to party. Now I want to make clear I don't give a shit if you party, everyone does but no need to be playing loud music until no hours and keep your neighbours up. So I confronted them again and explained I have work early and I would really appreciate it if they could keep it down, again they didn't.

I said fuck it I'm going to purposely slam my door every fucking morning until they stop. Not surprisingly it only took 2 days of me slamming my door for them to get angry and once again come to my door acting like I was in the wrong. The argument got heated this time but I made my point very clear to them ""keep the music down or at least after 12am or I'll keep doing it"" and then I slammed my door in their face.

Since then we've been in a long going feud with eachother and honestly it's kind of died down a bit now. We still hate eachother and we both still think the other is wrong.

"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend when she sent one of our private conversations commenting and lightly criticizing my best friend to my best friend?. So, it all started two weeks ago. 

I had recently got a girlfriend then -let's call her Erika- and we were talking on WhatsApp. Her parents don't allow her to go out with me, thinking I would do harm to her; so she proposed another plan, which was to go out with my best friend (lets call him Boris) and a friend of his (let's call her Idaho) which is also one of Erika's best friends. Together, it seemed like a friendly gathering to her parents; and we were talking about it. So I made some comments criticizing my best friend, Boris, saying he is not actually that good friends with Idaho. It wasn't actually bad criticism or gossip, I just made some comments about it and she was the one that started the conversation. 

Fast forward to this morning. 

Boris comes up to me, saying hi. He sits down next to me as usual, and we are in school. He asks what I think about people who talk behind other people's backs. I say of course, I don't like people who do that if the comments are degrading. He asks me why I talked behind his back. I say to him that I did not do anything with his name, then he shows me a screenshot that doesn't really explain anything; it just mentions his name. I say to him that I would explain the whole conversation to him, and he just storms out of the classroom. I would later figure out that Erika sent out convo to Idaho, and Idaho sent our convo to Boris. 

Fast forward to the breaktime. 

I went to Boris and talked to him about this subject. He seemed calm to me at first, but when I finished he got suddenly angry. He said that all things come to trust, and he said to me that he couldn't trust me anymore either; after me saying I don't trust Erika anymore. He said that maybe slowly the trust between us will replenish, but he said that it is not guaranteed, and he was still infuriated. 

Fast forward literally two minutes. 

I messaged my girlfriend that I don't trust her anymore, and I ask her why she did that. She couldn't explain anything, so I just said that we were over. By the way; we have been dating for 4 weeks, but we have been flirting for the past 5 months. I was one of her best friends, and I was her best male friend (also her boyfriend but whatever). I just thought she loved me, but now I cannot trust her after leaking our private conversation. 

Fast forwarding to now. 

I just learned from her sister that she has been crying while laying on her bed for the past 2 hours, and she has constantly been looking at my pictures. If she actually loved me that much, would she leak our conversation? Also, she was slightly ill during the happenings of the event, and I just learned that she has been getting sicker.

My family is close with her family, and as far as they’re aware, the furthest we’ve gone is first base. This is important later. 

After she told me, I was completely broken. I felt like a shell of a person for days, and just generally not like myself. One of those days, I came home frustrated and my mom asked what was wrong. Because of how close our families are, I absolutely cannot tell her what happened. I told her that me and my girlfriend are just having a rough time, and the conversation ended with her telling me that it’s not as important as my homework, and how I’ve gotten a few bad grades the past few days, and how she should take away my computer. When the conversations was over, I walked out and she said aggressively “take a nap while your at it. You could use one”

So yesterday, I called up my best friends mom and I told her not everything is okay, and I asked if she could pick me up for an hour or so. She agreed, and I explained everything to her. Because I know that if I ask her not to tell my mom something, then she understands. She really helped me get some perspective about everything.

"AITA for making my sister clean dog poop from my clothes. Hey there, throwaway account because of identifiable shitty information. Sorry for grammatical/typing errors--this just happened and I'm just trying to get it down. Hopefully this clears up some behavioral patterns on both of our parts, as issues like these have pervaded our relationship since we were kids.

I'm visiting my sister to see her new apartment in a different state. She has a new dog (8 months, house trained) which I have been walking while she works on grad school stuff.

The dog has been experiencing diarrhea since I came (don't worry, vet appt is tomorrow). We took him for a walk to get everything out of his system, gated off the carpeted living room I've been staying in and left to go out for the evening.

When we came back, we find the dog had wriggled his way past the gate and left...a big soggy mess on my clothing with a bit on the carpet. My sister got upset and told me I had set up the gate wrong. I had only followed her instructions, and she had seen the gate before we left the apartment. I jumped to clean the carpet and put the soiled clothes in a bag.

Meanwhile she, incredibly frustrated and still venting that I had put the gate up wrong, began doing dishes for some reason. When I asked her if she could get most of the dog poop off my clothes, she became incredibly angry.

She told me that I should just throw my clothes out if I don't want to deal with it. Obviously the dog doesn't know how much my clothes cost, but the shit bag held about $200 worth of clothing I had purchased with my own money (broke college student, yadda yadda). She then proceeded to grab the bag and throw all my clothes into a larger garbage bag; the one filled with dirty dog shit wipes.

I told her that the clothes are expensive for me and she began yelling I shouldn't have left them out, and that I was a horrible house guest, a ""bitch"", ""just like my mother"" (for not agreeing that I'm asking too much), and intolerable to live with. She fixated on how messy I've been while here because my shoes aren't in the closet, and continued to blame me for her dog's accident. For context, I had left some clothing outside of and right next to my luggage in a little alcove in the living room wall.

I understand it was a stressful situation, but I expected she’d at least deal with her dog's poop by getting the large bits off my clothes. I even said I'd wash it all tomorrow, I just didn't want to deal with the, uh, scraping.

She finally did go outside and remove the shit from my clothes. Then she washed them with detergent in the bathtub. I had to stop her from using bleach, which she claimed she doesn't know stains. For reference, she bleaches her hair.

We have had a rough history of family mental illness, and a toxic family dynamic growing up. She's always had anger and control issues, but I wasn't always the easiest to get along with. I had hoped we could all act like adults now that we are adults.

Edit 2: Changed the position of the above edit from the bottom of the post to the top

I (16M) was dating a girl (16F) for a long while (about a year and a half) when she started to get into BTS, and it took over her life. She only talked about BTS anymore, she only posted and followed people on twitter that also liked BTS, it was all she would listen to, she spent all of her money on their merch, and stopped talking to all of her friends that weren't into BTS aside from me.

She would try to force me to get into BTS all the time, claiming that ""anyone who comes in contact with these boys falls in love"". Whenever she would, I would try to tell her about the toxicity of the k-pop industry and fandom, but she wouldn't listen, claiming that the artists were just dedicated and some fans just loved them a little bit too much. (For context, one of the artists broke a leg and still went on to concert, and she claimed it was dedication and he wasn't forced to do it. She also claimed that the fans that tracked the band to an airport and threw themselves on them was ""a bit much, but it wasn't that bad"")

After I while I just got fed up with it, and broke up with her. She wasn't the person I fell in love with, she had completely changed. Rather than the deep discussions about life and the universe and politics, she just wanted to talk about whatever Yoongi or Jaehyun did that day.

"AITA for not wanting to pay for my housemate?. DISCLAIMER I’m aware this is petty - I’d just like to know, on principle, who is correct.

I live with several housemates and the layout of our house means the front door opens into one housemate’s bedroom. Instead, we use the backdoor, which is accessed by a gate that gives access to the gardens of several other properties. This gate has always been unlocked the whole time we’ve lived in this house.

Recently a new neighbour moved in and got a lock put on this gate, and gave each house a copy of the key. Obviously we need extra copies - the landlord is willing to pay for the one they need (personally I think they should be liable for all keys but thats not the point here). At this point only one housemate was around, and she now seems to think this key is her own personal key.

She went home for summer and took this key with her, leaving the rest of us with no way to access the main (back) door, therefore my housemate with the room at the front of the house has to put up with us using her room for access. She has her privacy invaded while the rest of us avoid leaving the house too often/at weird times.

Today she told us she is coming back and has got keys cut for the rest of us (at a price that seems quite expensive, we definitely could have got keys atleast half as cheap). Looking at the numbers, we realised she expects us to pay for the whole amount.

I am surprised as I thought we were (sort of) friends that she would be so blatantly rude/presumptuous. However its not the first time shes  been a bad housemate: creating excess mess etc.

AITA for expecting her to pay a share for the keys? Yes she got them cut, but months late and for a bad price - any of us would have been willing to go if we had the original copy.

Also she sounds like a huge asshole about the entire situation. Who on Earth takes the only key home for the summer? But what confuses me is why you all put up with it. You should have insisted that she mail the key home immediately at her expense, since she messed up by taking it and preventing everyone from getting copies and inconveniencing all of her housemates.

When I got there, I saw a woman nearby who wasn't reacting at all but was looking at him. I asked him again if he was okay, and asked 'is that your mummy?' He nodded again, so I smiled at her and 'sorry, I saw your son crying from my balcony and just wanted to see if he was okay'. She gave me the dirtiest look in the world and said nothing. The kid is still crying, and I sort of backed away awkwardly.


I'm back up in my flat now and she has been yelling at him (I don't know what she's saying as she's not speaking English) and has also yanked his school bag off him and thrown it in a bin. As I write this, she is also dumping a bunch of toys in the bin. The kid keeps looking up at me helplessly and she is giving me the evil eye. 


I don't know what to do as I obviously have no idea about their situation, or why she's doing this, so I have done nothing. AITA for just watching? Should I do anything, and if so, what??

"AITA for being ""too sensitive"" and complaining to security to enforce the ""no touching"" rule at a haunted house attraction?. Not bothering with a throwaway because whatever. Sorry for no formatting!

I'm a scare actor at a haunted house maze/attraction in my town. ""Security"" is all volunteers and not really a security guard/bouncer type of deal. 

There are very clear (and simple) rules for both ""victims"" (the maze goers) and the actors. They are posted both on giant red signs before the entrance to the attractions, and explained by security staff before anyone enters. Basic things like no cameras/filming, no touching the actors/the actors can't touch you, no running/pushing, no food or drink, no smoking, etc. Pretty easy to follow and a lot of common sense, right?

I've been working this job since the beginning of October and haven't had ANY incidents, until last night.

The first person was an older gentleman (elderly) there with his what I assume wife. I know he likely meant no harm by it, but while walking by he smiled and said ""Awful cold out isn't it sweetheart?"", touched my shoulder, and rubbed my back a bit before leaning in for a quick half cuddle. Again I'm sure he meant no harm, but I was really creeped out.

The second incident was a young adult male who had his eyes closed and his hands out (think of the zombie walk) with his friend steering him from behind. He turned the corner, and proceeded to grab my breast with his hand out. This was an accident which I would have let go, however after I said ""You accidentally grabbed my breast."" He chuckled and said ""Damn, GET SOME!"" and continued off with his friend.

The third time was a young child about 8 or so with their parents that ran up to me and began roaring at me (trying to scare me I guess) and pulling at my costume/trying to playfight with me and saying ""No touching no touching! Can't touch me I killed you!"".

During break I went to a member of security and I told them about what happened to me, mostly with the two males. Another one of the female workers made a remark about the same elderly gentleman I had first mentioned doing something similar to her. The security just shrugged and said that ""It was too late and they can't do anything about it now since they're long gone"" and ""I should have said something the second it happened"".

I went to find a second member of security and told them what happened, and they said ""It's just part of the job, try not to be too sensitive about it"". I asked this security member (male, if it matters) to take me to the owner/manager and they said that not only do they not know where he is, but that it's pointless yet again since the people are long gone. I told him that while that may be true of not being able to track down the offending visitors, that I'd like them to reiterate and to strongly make sure people are aware of NO TOUCHING before entering the maze. I was incredibly uncomfortable and I wanted to leave.

Was I being too sensitive? AITA for talking to multiple security members about this?","NTA. Accidents happen sure, but the first guy was intentionally creepy, the second guy refused to be apologetic. And the third brat needed to be watched by his guardian.

"AITA for not working un-compensated overtime to complete a project?. I recently joined my company's Systems Engineering team. My company doesn't pay overtime and my manager doesn't want to give out TIL. The arrangement for if you work out of hours (weekend server maintenance for example) is:

* You can come in a bit later or leave earlier if you had to work more than your regular hours.
* This time isn't 1:1.
* I am discouraged to leave earlier because I am the only engineer based outside of the US time zone and I need to have an overlap with them.
* You must email the team if you plan to come in later or leave earlier but you shouldn't specify why this is (which feels dodgy to me) 

The problem with this is that my job responsibilities make it difficult to come in a little bit later. Given my role I am of course expecting to have to work late from time to time however the work life balance is so far off, last week I worked an extra 25 hours due to a multitude of issues, project deadlines etc. the burnout was real and because of the frequency that I was having to work late it was causing me issues in my personal life and impacting mental health. At the end of that 65-hour week I was sitting at my desk feeling miserable and un-motivated and underlying feeling was that by working so many un-compensated hours that my time value was decreasing.

Anyway, fast forward to the issue this week. I am making a conscious effort to leave work on time so I can go home and relax and spend time with my girlfriend, work on my side-business and study. However there is project this week that came back to me after a few issues came-up and because it's a related to a specialist platform that my team isn't trained on only I can really resolve the issues, instinctively I thought about working late to plough through it which is my traditional approach but I know that I won't get any sort of appreciation or acknowledgement for that and I'll end up just making myself miserable and because of my core proactive responsibilities I only really have 1 hour or 2 that I can work on this per day and this is the kind of project where I need to be able to lock myself in a room and give it my un-interrupted attention - I am keeping my team posted on this but I feel like they are expecting me to work late on this. 

I can't shake this feeling that I am being unfair for not putting in the extra effort, so please keep me in check, am I being an asshole for not giving up my personal time to get this project completed?","NTA - I never work uncompensated, I don’t care what the project is.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for being annoyed with my roommate. This is my second year living with two other students at my school. For the last year, we've mostly got on well.

She comes in at 11pm and talks on speaker phone, without concern for whoever might be trying to sleep. Also, Kara's parents have picked her up multiple times at 4 am from our house, at which time they did not try to keep their voices down or shut doors/cupboards quietly.

"AITA for not taking my dog into my room for one night?. So my family has two dogs, and one of them is mine in every sense of the word while the other is a family dog. Both of them sleep indoors, my dog with me and the family dog with my brother.

Many times I’ve had to have both in my room (enough that I’d estimate around 30-ish times, not that often, but enough that it’s noticeable it’s never happens the other way around). Normally it’s because my brother was at a party late or felt “sick” or simply didn’t want to have the dog that night. I don’t mind having them so I always agreed to taking both of the dogs. 

Last night my family and I had a party with a large number of my friends and families workmates coming around too, and my brother ended up crashing pretty early-ish for a party night (around 11). I was still out enjoying the party and hanging out with everyone I knew. 
At around 12 we decided to let the dogs inside for the night, and because I wasn’t finished partying I decided that since my brother was already asleep and in his room he could take them both. 

My mum went off on a rant about me and my dog, saying stuff like “this is your child and you’re just ditching her to party” and “he’s sleeping why should he have to have them both tonight”. I quickly pointed out that I’d done it for him several times before and that I’d rather this then having my dog locked into my room by herself (she has abandonment issues and likes to be with someone else at all times, especially the family dog who is older than her and acts like a big sister of sorts) 

She then refused to talk to me saying she couldn’t believe what i was doing and that I needed to be responsible for my pet. Every time she saw me again that night she gave me dismissive remarks about my dog and harsh looks. It kinda ruined the fun for me so I ended up retreating to my room anyway and bringing my dog back with me when I did.

The way my mother acted all night and her comments made me think I was acting like an asshole when I’d originally thought it was a sound decision and now I’m second guessing myself.

"WIBTA if I ask my cat-loving friend to stop sending me snapchats of them?. So, for context: this is a friend whom I've known for nearly a decade. We both love cats and each have a few of our own. A couple years ago I moved away from our hometown to a different state well across the country. Being in a long distance friendship where we went months without seeing each other, she would often snapchat me pictures of her cats as a conversation opener and a way to keep in touch, and I would reciprocate as well. This past summer, she ended up moving about an hour away from me for work and (unrelated) personal reasons. We now get to see each other (and each other's cats) a few times a month depending on our schedules. It's been awesome having her and her furry companions close at hand... however, the snaps of her cats have only increased in frequency to the point where I get anywhere from five to fifteen a day, every day. Often they are not really ""unique"" pictures (her cat laying on the bed or sitting on the couch in the same pose, day after day) and usually don't have any captions. (Or if they do, the captions are merely commenting on the cuteness of her cats.) I understand her sentiments, Reddit! I love cats passionately and she has objectively adorable cats. But it's annoying to get flooded with so many snaps... especially when I've stopped responding to them in any capacity but they haven't slowed down. I've gotten to the point where I'm sick of seeing them period. WIBTA if I asked her to stop sending the snaps altogether?","NTA

"AITA for whistleblowing on a company for underpaying staff?. I used to work at a small restaurant and bar. I was the Bar Manager. The payroll was done by the GM and sent to the owner to process. The assistant manager left due to conflicts with the GM and the hiring process was still happening. The GM was on holiday when payroll was due so she showed me how to fill everything out. It was a basic Excel sheet with formulas for hours x pay rate. I checked staff hours on the rota with their actual worked hours from the clocking in and out system. 
When a staff member clocked in or out on the till a receipt was printed. This was accessible via the software in the office. I checked through all FOH hours, all fine. I start to fill out the kitchen hours and saw that one of their totals to be paid was less than it should have been. He was in the same pay bracket as myself and worked similar hours, yet his pay was £200 less than mine. I checked I hadn’t made any mistakes as I didn’t want him to be underpaid for my mistake. Turns out, each Wednesday for the whole month he wasn’t being paid. The formula for the Wednesday box on his name had been deleted. I checked previous payrolls and it was the same. Their was no password protection on formula boxes so this issue could have easily been prevented. 

After noticing this, I fixed the formula and password protected it all, with the company password that was pretty much the same for everything. I sent it over to the owner with a note in the email about his pay being missing for however many months and if she could look into it. 

I went back to the bar and one of the girls asked if her hours were right as she thought she was being underpaid. I went back and checked her hours. If she had clocked in at 10:45am but didn’t actually begin her shift until 11am, she wouldn’t be paid until the official start time, which is fair as most staff get in early to have a smoke. I ignored those extra times already and had filled in the right clocking out times. She should have been getting about £350 for that month. She works the same amount of hours give or take each month but the last two months had only been getting £250. I checked over the past months payrolls and the GM had been lazy and just filling in rota times instead of clocking out times. She’d been getting underpaid a fair amount each month. I took some screenshots of the software that showed her clocking out times and sent them to her so she could  email the owner to query it. 

I get pulled into the office the next day by the owner asking why she’s getting emails from her staff with images of ‘her’ software that was confidential. I understand that part, but the staff can keep their clocking in and out sheets from the till for their own records, so it wasn’t like it was private information.

"AITA for telling my SO that she shouldn't broadcast our arguments to friends.. When me (34M) and my partner (36F) have an argument, she has the habit of sharing every detail, word-for-word, with her mother, friends, and sometimes my friends.

Probably the worst example was about a year ago, when we had a really big argument, the kind that ended with me packing my bags in the morning (we had broken up for a few months, she found out I'd slept with another woman before we got back together by snooping on my phone while I slept, and completely lost her shit).

It wasn’t just that she told her friends and family, but she sent my best friend (whom she never got along with) a message describing the argument and saying I was a toxic person who didn’t deserve friends.

She also made sure that my colleagues and boss found out, by approaching people from my company she barely knew, and even told all the details to my boss's wife. I probably don’t need to tell anyone that when we’re angry, people have a tendency of portraying themselves in the best possible light, and the opposing party in the least generous way.

We eventually managed to work through things and forgive each other, but I’m still dealing with the fact that all of her friends think I'm an asshole,  because all they ever hear about me is negative stuff, and never the positives. My own friends just think she is unhinged.

I’ve asked her not to report every intimate detail of our relationship, especially the negative parts, to so many people, especially my friends. She says she is an open person, and that she can’t ”lie” to people, so she always has to say what’s on her mind, and it's her way of coping.

A little about him - he is an ok landlord for the most part but shitty at resolving problems. He responds to texts and calls right away but when he agrees on a time to come meet any of us living at the apartment, he is ALWAYS without fail at least 3 hours late. Everyone is used to this so we don’t really make it a big deal. One of the many times this happened was when I was meeting him to get my keys to move in. He was 3 hours late so I was left waiting outside in the rain. Another personal problem I had with him was when he allowed me to move to a better room for a $20 price difference (paid biweekly). I went on vacation right before we agreed I would move in and when I came back he gave my bed away to someone else even though I already paid the price difference.

So for the five extra days I would be staying, I calculated that I would pay at the rate of the old room since he gave my room away and never refunded me the difference. I also expressed to him that I think I should only pay for four days instead of five since the day I moved in was one day into the biweekly period and so technically he owes me a day of rent. I wouldn’t be so calculating but he charged my old roommate to stay one night so I thought it would only make sense to give myself the free day.

Being the  rebellious teenager she is, she went anyway (I'm not surprised or angry,  I did the same at her age) but then called me at around 2 AM saying  that she was feeling uncomfortable because her friends were pressuring  her to drink and do drugs and she really didn't want to, so she asked if  I would be able to pick her up.   


I work as a security guard,  and the way the job works is we have 5 people rotating in 5 different  spots. It's a very high security company we work for and it's instant  dismissal for leaving a post unguarded. I called my supervisor and asked  if he would be able to get a replacement in ASAP for me, but because we  were already a guard down and it was 2 AM, there was no one available.

I  called my daughter back and asked if she was drunk, she said no. I  asked her if there was anyone else at the party who was sober, she said  yes. I told her to go up to them and say ""My friends are pressuring me  to drink, but I really don't want to, is it cool if I hang with you  guys?"" and to just stay with them until my shift finished in 3 hours  when I would be able to pick her up. She said she would.

When I  finally picked her up, she refused to talk to me at all until we got  home where all she said was ""I can't believe you wouldn't pick me up  when I asked you too.""

"AITA for not paying for the extra meal I accidentally ordered at a wedding?. My sixteen year old son and I went to a wedding. When we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

At the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. The waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

I later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal.

"AITA? I pulled out of my BFF wedding.. A few years ago, my boyfriend (now husband) and I rented a house from my Best Friends fiance. The house was not the greatest. The carpet was pieces of old carpet glued together. The closets were not functioning, the doors and windows needed to be covered with plastic in the winter because it was so cold in there, the fridge leaked, etc. Since we were friends, we had a lease but didnt pay a security deposit. Most of his stuff was stored in the basement, where he could access it anytime he wanted. We lived there for about 2 years. During this time, her fiance was the WORST landlord EVER! he would show up randomly, unannounced. We didnt mind much being that he was our friend and he had his stuff there. Throughout this time, my friendship with my Bff became a little rocky. She was drinking ALOT. Always arguing with me when we would go out. Became OBSESSED with the fact she was getting married (bridezilla) and she just wasnt the person I once knew. 
Anyway, my husband and I decided we didnt want to rent anymore and began looking for a house to buy. We found our dream home and began the settlement process. We bought our house in February and they were getting married that July. When we told them that we were buying a house and moving, they seemed upset (mainly because they were going to be loosing thier rent money) not at all happy for us. 
We were to settle on our house at the end of Feb. But as house buying goes, sometimes it gets delayed. Rent to him is due the 1st of the month. I asked him if we could stay for a week until we got all our stuff out, but he wanted the full rent money. We couldnt afford it being that we just bought a house! 
We moved the last week of February. My BFF's fiance helped us move, and that weekend he confessed to me that he didnt want to marry her. He told me he was having second thoughts because of her drinking and she had become abusive towards him. 
After we moved all our stuff out, My BFF called me and demanded we pay her 200.00 for a cleaning fee. We werent even done moving yet! Apparently, they were angry we didnt vaccum. I went back to the house and got into an argument with her fiance. I told him he needed to tell her what he told me and he seemed to be deflecting his feelings onto me. My BFF came in the door (drunk) and swung at me. This was the start to a whole storm. 
After that, we didnt speak for 2 months. I finally got together with her at a party and people told me how much crap she was talking about both me and my husband. So, I decided to pull out of her wedding. How could I stand next to her at her wedding, as he MOH and make a friendly speech? For one, her fiance told me he didnt want to marry her, for 2, I knew we would fight again and I didnt want to ruin her wedding. It's been 4 years since we have spoken. And I miss her. I want to rekindle the friendship and have reached out to no avail. AITA in this situation? Should I just let it go?","NTA.

"WIBTA if I let my son play hookie during school punishment?. My 10 year old son had 2 incidents at school right before winter break, which caused him to lose the opportunity to go on the big field trip that takes place right after they get back. He's heartbroken to not go, and I'm considering taking him out for a fun day the first day his class will be gone.

My son has had a rough go at 5th grade. 

Granted, I'm biased of course, but he's a great kid. He's thoughtful, sweet, smart, funny, and just all around amazing. He has always been ""different"" which I've always embraced, encouraged and allowed. The past few years, that has meant him preferring wearing some girls clothes, leading up top to him wearing exclusively girl's/ women's clothes this year. 

It hasn't been an issue at school until this year. He's been bullied pretty bad, but kept the extent of it quiet until the past few weeks. 

Which leads us to the incidents that lost him the privilege of going on the trip. 

The first one, his lunch was stolen. They all put their lunches in a bin that gets taken to the cafeteria. Lunchtime comes, his is nowhere to be found. At recess afterwards, he was still upset and walked off into the parking lot, then brought back by the office staff. 

Next offense happened on pajama day a few days later. Two kids (one that had called his very close best friend a terrible name earlier) pulled his robe off and were hurting him while trying to pull his top off while saying snotty things about his girl's clothing and sexuality. He punched one of them and got away from them. 

I know that walking off the playground isn't acceptable, and punching someone isn't acceptable. I understand why the school deemed both of these incidents as reasons why he shouldn't go on the big 5th grade trip. 

But I also very much empathize with him on why he behaved why he did on each occurrence. 

I know it will be hard for him to watch the rest of his class show up with their bags packed, then stay behind with the few other kids that aren't going while everyone else leaves for a 3 day skiing adventure in the mountains. 

Would it be awful if I took him out for a fun day that first day? 

Thank you in advance for your judgements.

*Edit* His school has been great with supporting him being him, and the bullying issue. I met with his teacher and half a dozen staff the day before the punching incident where we discussed the bullying and how to support him with his differences and quirks. The principal in a previous meeting was very supportive and he was adamant that bullying for sexual preference/ gender identity wasn't tolerated.","NTA. You sound like the sweetest mom and it seems that you really love your son. All moms should aspire to be like you. I think it’s totally reasonable to take him out for fun on not only the first day, but all three days even. (If it would be possible and fun for everyone of course.) 

I don’t think he will learn anything the days everyone else is gone, he’s being punished for defending himself, and there’s a possibility he will be staying behind with the bullies. The best reason to take him out for fun though, in my opinion, is that it will show and reinforce to him that you are on his side. You will support him and make his life better when he needs you, and he won’t be afraid to defend himself. 

I hope you have a fun time with him! :)",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for not letting my mom to call me ""honey."". I'm 31 (m) and I grew up without my mom. My dad raised me since forever. She was never a part of my life since I was a kid due to her marrying someone else and never bother to check on me until I'm 29. She suddenly wanted to get involved with my life because she's getting older and she has one kid, but he's gay so he won't have biological grandchildren. She keeps calling me with words like ""Oh Andrew honey, you grew up so handsome!"" and ""oh baby look at you now"" and I can't stand it. I acted natural but the more she's trying to get involved the more I feel annoyance. What if her son is not gay, will she ever check up on me? And my dad died so his inheritance goes to me, and the timing feels way too convinient for me. It might just be a feeling rather than truth but I really don't like it. I never feel anything towards her and still look at her as a stranger. I just couldn't emotionally investing myself towards her, so I asked her (politely) to stop calling me honey in general. It irks me.

She was heartbroken, and few of my relatives suddenly messages me saying that I'm trying to sabotage her attempt to make things right, which adds to my anger more. She tried to reach our for me after almost THREE decades of my entire life. They said that I have to be more open and welcoming.

"AITA for not wanting to bring my boyfriend to the studio when I record my first EP?. My boyfriend is into music production and composing and while we've done a lot of projects together in the past before we dated we haven't really worked on a lot of music together since we've been in a relationship. 

Lately he's been mocking me for my songs and just poking fun at me for taking forever to release music and just kinda making jokes about my lyrics. I think in his head he see's it as lighthearted fun but I've made it clear to him that it offends me. 

Recently I got an opportunity to record my first EP at a really nice studio thanks to one of my student's friends and now he's begging me to go cause he wants to see the studio. I just don't want him there cause I feel insecure with his past judgement and I don't want to have any negative energy while I'm recording songs that are very personal to me. 

He's also trying to guilt me and bring up all the things he's helped me with musically. While I appreciate his help in the past, that has nothing to do with what I am going to be recording. 

Am I the asshole for not inviting him?

Edit: Thank you for all the replies. I read through all of them and I truly appreciate your advice. I'm going to stand my ground and let him know I'm going myself to record and if he wants to come when I'm finished he can that way I can be focused during the session and he can get a glance of the studio around the last hour","Not only would I not let him come to the studio, I’d break up with him for treating me like that.",0,0,0,0,1
"AITA for telling elementary schoolers they can’t wait for the bus on my porch?. Today I noticed about 4-5 screaming kids on my porch whilst I was trying to take a nap on the couch. I know that they’re always being dropped off and picked up on the corner of my property. There’s like 12 different kids who get off at this stop alone and they’re between the ages of like 6-11

So anyways, it’s kind of rainy and they’re on my porch, which I already find irritating as many of their parents wait in their cars until the bus is there anyways so they should already be told to stay away from my property but I digress...

The real problem is that I have a nest of house finches on my porch that I have been very careful not to disturb. The parents have already lost one baby and I don’t want these little birdies to get hurt or abandoned as they’re very sensitive and about to leave nest

So today I told the kids about the birds and kicked them off of my porch and out onto the sidewalk. I almost went up to the parents outside as well, but ultimately just gave a stern look",NTA.

"AITA for starting an argument. I'm on mobile so sorry for bad formatting.

For context, I (16) am in a Discord server for a video game I like to play. It has ~75 active members. There's a person (30), however, who I often get into arguments with. I'll call her K.

It began when K joined the server. I was joking around, saying ""Haha America is fat"" (I live in America). She responded with ""That's not nice."" I know it's a really minuscule thing, and I can't really remember exactly what happened since it was a few months ago, but I think this is when the tension started.

Over time, K got more and more on my nerves (and I imagine this is how she felt towards me). I wasn't the only one fed up with her, though. There's a channel that's linked to the in-game chat, so you can talk to people in the game while on Discord and vice versa. When you use an emote, it shows up as that emote's name/file name rather than the actual emote when in-game. No big deal. Someone used an emote, and K responded with ""Can you not use emotes? Holy shit it's annoying."" Another person said ""Well so are you, but we don't say anything."" This understandably set K off, and she started calling the other person the ""c"" word, and when I jumped in she called me a b----.

A month or so ago, I apologized to her in dm's by saying this:
""Hi, I apologize for the unwarranted message but I wanted to say sorry for how I've acted towards you. From this point on I'd like to be on good terms if that's alright with you :)""

She never responded. I'm worried I said something wrong. I feel like I made her hate me more.

Today, someone was having an issue in-game, and when people explained what went wrong, K says, ""It's been known to happen since forever."" I shouldn't have responded to her, but I replied with ""well clearly they didnt know, no reason to be condescending :p""

I wish I hadn't.

She started calling me a brat, the c word, etc. 
This is exactly how the conversation went:

K: No one is being condescending. Do you not read the rules? Don't be a ___ every time someone says something to you that you don't like. I was informing him that it was a common problem.

me: it looked rather condescending

K: If you can't reply to people without being a brat, don't reply to people at all.

me: ditto to you friend ^^

She blocked me after that. There's a rule that if an argument is started, you DM the person you're talking to in order to avoid drama so by no means was she being aggressive. 

I feel bad because I feel like I always initiate an argument with her. The common variable in all the issues is me not being able to keep my mouth shut when I think she's being rude to me or someone else. 

I know she crossed the line when she started swearing and using personal attacks. However, I question if my own actions were in the right, as I would interject her with passive-aggressive retorts if I thought she said something mean even if I had nothing to do with the conversation and it wasn't necessary.

"WIBTA if I took my mini-fridge from my roommate who doesn't shower?. I go to school that guarantees housing. However, my current roommate's inability to compromise and empathize has driven me out of my dorm that I am paying for, and instead, live with my very-understanding bf whose apartment is an hour away from school. However, the commute is nothing compared to having to live in the dorm and I've even come to enjoy it, so having to move out 6 months prematurely is not even my primary concern.

The first red flag was on move-in day when I asked about her shower schedule and she shrugged and said, ""Oh, you know, whenever I remember to."" I didn't think much of it but as this year has progressed, I have never once seen her go into the bathroom and hear water running, come out with wet hair, or wash her bed sheets. The BO is more noticeable when she's in the room so I try to go there when she's not.

She also has a habit of bringing food into the room and letting it sit for months (there's a bowl of squash that has been sitting there since winter). I bought our mini-fridge at her request and I hardly ever use it. She lets food go bad in there and when I ask her to eat it faster, she tells me she'll ""eat it at whatever pace I want."" The pinnacle of this was me throwing out her spoiled food in December as she had already left for winter break and her yelling at me over text about it.

Another side-note: she keeps an empty bottle of parmesan cheese in her bed. She tucks the thing in like it's her child and one time, I saw it on the ground and said, ""You dropped something"" and she scrambled out of bed to grab it and tucked it back in.

For anyone who thinks I should go to my RA, I don't because my RA is the most antisocial guy I've ever met. He's nice but his entire vibe tells me he wants to interact with other people as little as possible and I'd also like to interact with my roommate as little as possible which would not happen if he had us talk things out.

This morning, after a bad night's sleep, I went back to my room to see if I could nap but she was there. The godawful smell hit me like a freight train. I couldn't be in the room without feeling like I was going to vomit. I asked a friend to come over and he agreed with me, saying ""It's not even something words can describe."" Later, I texted her asking her to shower and she told me, verbatim, to ""fuck right off"".

Even though I can't stand her, I've tried keeping things civil and she basically has had a single room this whole year. But I feel like it's gone too far. My bf suggested we take the mini-fridge back to his place as we could actually use it, but she seems mentally unstable frankly, and I'm worried she would go off at me and that it's too extreme.

A bit of background info: I'm (16M) currently on vacation in Crete with my mom's side of the family. My 3 older sisters from a different mother joined us on the trip and one of them (we'll call her Alex(26F)) is a vegan.

We just came back from eating dinner in the hotel and Alex didn't find anything to eat. Since she's an adult, she sat with us but when we finished she went back to her room in a tired happy mood.

"AITA for not wanting to live with my roommate anymore?. Pete and I are really good friends. We had been living together for 11 months. It was a very fun year but things started deteriorating towards the end. 


We were both in a bit of a funk but Pete was really bringing me down. He would smoke my weed on a daily basis, leave a mess, let dishes get mouldy, rarely do chores, etc. 


Our lease was up in about a month and I had decided I didn't want to live with him anymore. I broke the news to him and told him to let me know what he wanted to do. Our apartment was an incredible place at a great price so I offered to move out and leave the place to him (I had some other friends I could stay with) and even help him find someone to take over my place. Or if he wanted to move out that would also be fine. I left it up to him. 


Pete took the news very poorly. He saw it as a personal attack and a betrayal of our friendship. It was a tough situation because it really was about our dynamic and not about the place itself. He claimed that a month wasn't nearly enough time to figure things out and that I was absolutely fucking him over (he was never very financially secure). 


It was sloppy but we both ended up moving out and he had to move into his brothers extra room. Unfortunately the apartment was out of our hands.

"AITA for refusing to taste my wife’s food because I saw her leave the bathroom without washing her hands during cooking?. Having regrets and feeling like I should’ve tasted that damn cake. 

Anyways this past weekend my wife was baking a kind of vegan loafcake for herself. She does meal prep on weekends and the food is solely for her so I don’t have any input and I don’t really pay attention to what she makes. 

Well I was in the dining room working when she was cooking in the kitchen (open layout so I see everything). She had something on the stove then announced to me she had to go poo. During her poo, the thing on the stove started burning so I yelled to her that something smells like burning and should I turn it off. She screams no and runs out (without flushing or washing her hands) to check on her food. 

I noticed she didn’t wash her hands but didn’t say anything because 1) it was her food and 2) I just genuinely forgot between the burning pot and everything else. I only remembered at the end, when she finished baking her cake and wanted me to try a slice. 

I told her no thanks at first, but she kept insisting and asking why I’m being so difficult until I confessed it was because I saw she didn’t wash her hands and she used those same hands to chop fruit, taste batter, and arrange toppings.

Well... I’ve never seen her so mad at me. She called me a man child and told me that I’m being a baby over nothing, and that I should be grateful she made food for me to try in the first place instead of whining over germs. I kinda stuck to my argument and told her I’m not tasting anything. 

But now she’s been giving me the silent treatment and I’m kinda regretting being stubborn over this. Maybe I should’ve tasted the poo cake. AITA for doing what I did?","NTA - one of the most basic parts of food safety is washing your hands. The bacteria from fecal matter can spread far and wide.
