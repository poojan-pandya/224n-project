a873uo,NAH. She just needs to learn to give you the space you need. She’ll get there. You are definitely not in the wrong on this one.
a8783a,"NAH. I'm agnostic too, but I would stand if other people were standing. It doesn't cost me anything and I think it's the respectful thing to do in this context. 

If you don't agree with my view on the matter or you think otherwise, I still don't think that makes you an asshole."
a87gxk,"YTA. Look Chandler...you and Monica both suck. Stop stringing poor Joey along. JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!! Seriously though, y’all just need to tell him the truth, and takes what comes with it. Hope you can all stay Friends when it’s said and done."
a87wgs,"NTA. Your kids, your rules. If she thinks that she can do whatever she wants because it's her house, then the only logical response you can take is to make sure they're never at her house. You might enjoy it over at r/JUSTNOMIL"
a8836j,"NTA.  You don't owe anyone a date.  You should want to go on a date and if your gut is saying you don't, you shouldn't.    

On the other hand, you can't expect this guy to wait around for you to be ready to date him.  So if he is someone you are genuinely interested in, and not ready to lose forever, you should take the initiative, brave up, and ask him out.   

But that really doesn't sound like the case here.  ""Nice and no red flags"" is pretty much the lowest bar you can set for a possible date."
a884id,"NTA. Cheating is a *massive* dick move and you're a more generous person than me for wanting to move past it at all. Snooping would *normally* be an asshole behaviour, but I think it's kinda justified here. Although, IMO, if you're feeling the urge to snoop it would suggest to me that you don't trust her (understandable) but personally that would make me seriously rethink the relationship anyway.

But regardless of the ethics of snooping, she cheated on you, then lied about the extent of her relationship with the guy. Definitely grounds for a breakup. Some *might* validly consider you a bit of an asshole, but she is absolutely the primary asshole here."
a88l8w,"NTA 

it's caregiver fatigue, and it's very real. Your exhaustion is no less real than it would be if your husband did have cancer. 

Take some time off. Make sure you're caring for yourself. Maybe do some therapy on your own to help you develop coping skills. 

If you really can't deal with it,  it's sad, but it is what it is. You're not an asshole,  you're just exhausted.

a890mj,"NTA, not even a little bit. He's being incredibly selfish and doesn't seem to be even acknowledging that you're trying to help him. Even with an introverted personality like his, all he'd have to do would be to say ""I appreciate you trying so hard for me, I'll try to be good for you too."" He doesn't need to abuse substances to grieve, and isolating oneself emotionally is just bad news for a relationship full stop no matter what the reason is. He doesn't sound mature enough for a relationship at all tbh. He's supposed to be helping you help him, coming to you with feelings he can't handle on his own, instead of burying those feelings in drink and green."

a89siz,NTA.  The minute he pulled the “I’m a tenant” thing all brotherly obligations ceased.  
a8aa10,"INFO, what were the circumstances? "
a8af0g,NTA. It's rude for her to treat you like a chauffeur when you're doing her a favor.
a8ajkm,NTA. That’s fucking weird behavior 
a8aohb,YTA. Freezing is an extremely common fear response.
a8au0l,I’m really not sure how you could be seen as an asshole here for supporting yourself and your disabled fiancé. How that “ruined Christmas” is beyond me. 
a8b3g7,"NTA. You have a case of ""bad roommate syndrome."" Try to avoid him until you no longer have to live with him because 1. he's not going to change 2. your life will only be made miserable if you continue to have conflicts with him. It might feel like you're ""losing"" or ""giving in"" to his behavior, but ultimately it'll make your quality of life so much better."
a8b80v,YTA and you know it. 
a8b8ky,"NTA, but it sure sounds like the rest of his family are. "
a8bb6x,Holy shit you are so self righteous 
a8bf1f,"NTA. You don't owe her an in-person interaction. I think, if anything, texting her will make it clear to her that you two no longer have a relationship. Just don't screw her over on anything roommate-related, like don't leave things a mess or damage anything or anything like that."
a8bfgm,"NTA

You tried to help and shes apparently doesn't listen. She sounds dangerous too, you are doing the right thing. Sure, she is family, but after a while you need to snap out of it and realize they can't be helped."
a8bp6a,"NTA.  If you feel that they're not good friends, don't be their friend."
a8byxi,"NAH, but I agree with your parents. That being said, your brother agreed. If your parents don’t want to do it, just have brother Venmo you"
a8c2c3,"NTA, separating siblings is pretty typical with pet adoption.  You could still take your cat and visit your parents, but cats are pretty solitary so he'll be just fine."
a8c7gl,"NTA. 

Your immediate response to lie to avoid drama is a relationship red flag. It's one thing if you know she doesn't trust you (this is bad to begin with) and it's another if you don't trust her to learn to trust you (which makes things worse).

If you know she will hold something that is 100% not your fault against you, your relationship is doomed without some serious soul-searching changes."
a8cg6t,"YTA.  Racism isn't cool, but neither is stealing from your roommate."
a8cjl6,"Definitely NTA. It's your house, not hers.

And her analogy about having intelligent people in the house leads me to believe that she herself, is not as intelligent as she things. Because that's the dumbest analogy for this situation I've ever heard."
a8ckx9,"Chat with the person behind you. Just turn around and ask if they are OK with it.

The airlines are the asshole here."

a8cmt6,This is a gross overreaction to the minor inconvenience his offense caused you.  You're the asshole.  YTA
a8cpc7,"NTA.

The n-word only refers to a single word. The word ""negro"" is antiquated and un-PC, but it definitely isn't THE n-word.

Also, just some historical context for anyone too young to remember: 

""Negro"" was the preferred nomenclature for a *long* time; it wasn't a slur. So if a movie character uses that word, it's meant to demonstrate that the character is older and out of touch, but not necessarily hateful."
a8cvvc,"NTA - it's your house too. I agree you should have phrased that better but he should be understanding that you were upset, tired, and caught off guard. He's the asshole for not valuing your needs when you brought them up. "
a8cxol,"YTA. You agreed to do something with no strings attached, no payback plan; pulling that out now would be an asshole move. However, it does give you grounds to insist on payment in the future (if this kind of thing happens again), and to leverage her to take better care of her cat. 


On another point, was she seriously just going to let her cat die a slow death from diabetes??? She’s an asshole too. "
a8czbz,"YTA - but that’s fine as long as you are okay being unemployed. 

Yes, you put in your vacation request timely, but the onus is on you to make sure it’s approved. You are the one who needed the time off. "
a8d33k,"NTA

You reacted like anyone would when they feel disrespected. Explain to her exactly how these jokes make you feel. I used to be the asshole that draws attention to everyone else's mistakes etc. until a friend sat me down and told me exactly how I was coming off. I honestly didn't notice it at the time but changed my behaviour as well as I could. Maybe she is the same way. 
If after this talk nothing changes she just plain doesn't respect you and should get her ass dropped."
a8dcar,"NTA.

It sounds like the kid has ODD or something along those lines.  Regardless of why he is the way he is, it's clear that it's going to take constant, proactive effort to help him grow into a functional member of society (not to mention keep him out of jail).  I get that you love your fiance, and probably the kid too, but you're under no obligation to remain in their lives if it's too much for you to handle. "
a8dex3,"YTA 100%. sooo much. they're kids, they're excited and curious , how could you ruin an entire Christmas for them? this will make them hate Christmas and probably you too."
a8dj34,NTA - It's YOUR food. Offer it to who you want. Your boyfriend's friends sound like entitled assholes.
a8dlk5,"YTA. Why would their trip have to revolve around entertaining you the entire time, just because you volunteered to come along? You're an adult, you should be able to entertain yourself for an hour without spending money"
a8dyth,"NTA 

It is really REALLY hard to get me to agree with not tipping, but bringing the kids menu is an insanely insulting thing to do to someone. Making fun of someone you don’t know’s physical appearance is a really rude thing to do. It crossed the line from bad service to something else. "
a8dzt3,"YTA for texting them all your feelings, and all the things you heard 2nd hand when you were talking about him behind his back.  
 
He sounds like he's never been a good friend  and you're well rid of him.   
 
Next time you discover that someone is a shithead, mentally wash your hands of them and walk away.  Don't stir up drama by trying to force them to care."
a8e3sc,NTA. Also your boyfriend sounds like the kind of person who will continually do shitty things to test your loyalty/love/honesty. Be careful. 
a8e7pv,YTA. EHS.  Did your parents not teach you all to share nicely?  Compromise? Was there no other food available?  Would you and your brother let your sister go hungry?  FFS. You knew she didn't want the whole thing.
a8egym,YWBTA. You have no right to wrest control of this situation. This is not your information to give
a8ehs9,Holy Mother of Jerry Springer... 
a8eyps,YTA. Open marriages work when everyone is aware and abides by the rules. She was stressed with a sick child and called because she needed help. Your partner should understand if you bail quickly to help care for your kid. 
a8f04a,"NTA at all--this seems like a pretty big boundary violation by J, and I honestly would probably have left that counseling session immediately upon discovering it was ""for me."" I say that in quotes because it was actually for J...J may have wanted to help, but wound up guilt-tripping you about their panic attacks. I would definitely end that friendship in your position. Hope all goes well!

ETA: Maybe not end the friendship entirely, but definitely take a step back and think about its effect on your life overall...is their boundary-violating a regular occurrence? Are they generally supportive in a way you need? I may have been too harsh in my initial assessment."
a8f269,"YTA. Seriously. Your sister gave you money months ago and now you are being a little bitch about paying her back? You are a serious jackass.

I love how when it's you getting money from her it's a few months ago, but when it's her getting her money back she's ""pretending"", and it's ""ten months of silence"".

Unbelievable. You're a giant asshole."
a8f7fl,"YTA. 

That would be pretty petty of you. "
a8f8rx,"YTA. *You’re using her* for her money. 

If you’re unhappy, you should leave and let her find someone who is happy."
a8fdw2,YTA and that post was barely coherent.
a8fn2x,"NTA.

But the ""right"" way to fix a problem like this is to tell the person the correct time, give them 15 minutes past that, then just start eating without them.  It's amazing how someone who's perpetually late can suddenly start being on time for things when others stop letting them get away with it."
a8fuih,"NTA

Oof, your brother is being a dick. His excuse that you needed ""to determine if everything was legit before driving"" is utter BS, since he KNEW that the registration and insurance were expired. He just neglected to tell you. "
a8fvkr,"YTA

Dogs are notoriously stoic about pain. They typically won't openly express that discomfort the way humans do. But your dog has demonstrated that she's really sick. Throwing up a lot, being lethargic, and refusing to eat are all signs that a serious health issue could arise. You need to take your dog to the hospital. 

**If you cannot afford decent healthcare for your dog, you cannot afford a dog.**

Unless your family will not be able to make ends meet without the $300, you absolutely need to take that dog to the hospital! And to avoid having to make this sort of decision in the future, you should invest in pet insurance (which is as little as 10 bucks a month) or at least save up some cash for emergencies."
a8fytx,"NTA. Full disclosure, I only read up to 'autism'... but her language has nothing to do whatsoever with autism. Block"
a8g27n,"Clearly NTA in this context. Clearly just looking for validation.

Why do you waste our time? This is a rant, not an actual AITA post.

&#x200B;"
a8g4ma,Calling your wife a jerk and leaving the house because she isn’t doing exactly what you want her to do is childish. You are NTA.
a8g4oy,NTA. It’s something you are feeling and you should be able to voice it. I also don’t understand why you see them 3 times in the span of a week. Me and my boyfriend have our own Christmas ( just me and him) on the 23 then my mother’s on 24 then his mother on the 25. Not comparing or anything just letting you know it’s unusual you see your in laws so much in that short span.  If you feel like it’s not fair I would recommend voicing it. It may feel weird since it’s already been a thing that you have agreed to in the past but people change and so does the way you feel about things. If you don’t voice it you may end up having ill feelings toward them and act passive aggressive and get into an even deeper issue with your spouse or his family. Good luck.
a8g7y6,"ESH. He doesn’t get to tell you what to do, but imo watching porn and making it are different and that should be recognized."
a8gj1h,"You're kind of an asshole here. You shouldn't promise something and then bail with no explanation. At the very least, you could've explained the situation to her. Don't make promises you won't keep. "
a8guj0,"47F here. I've had tons of male friends and also am prior military. This is less of a 'guy' issue and more of a 'no class' issue. My sons are in their twenties and neither they nor their friends do that, either. These guys sound like a bunch of pigs. NTA."
a8gwvo,"I'm going to take my downvoted for this but...

YTA for only talking to women because you want to fuck them.  This has nothing to do with getting with another woman or whatever.  There's a good chance this woman just wanted to be friends and there's nothing wrong with that.  But refusing to talk to or be friendly with women who aren't interested in fucking you shows you really only value women for sex."
a8h0mc,"YTA, not for disputing her politics but for not saying thank you about dinner"
a8hbip,definitely NTA. You asked for more information when you couldn’t recall everything-you were actively trying to be more involved in the story and she reacted in a totally uncalled for manner. 
a8hgdw,NTA. Tell your boss who signed you up without our permission if he brings it up.
a8hm9z,"NTA. Wow this is an awkward situation. But ultimately, you shouldn’t enter into a marriage if you don’t want to. You have a long list of good reasons not to marry him. To add another, you could maybe face criminal charges if the wrong person finds out it was a green card marriage. Yes, the situation sucks but you’re not the asshole for refusing to do something you’re uncomfortable with. "
a8ho5t,"NTA

If she could send a group text to scold all of you, she could have sent a reminder text the week before. Or, as you said, the day of. This is just passive-aggressive nonsense.

Just as a tip though, I keep all the family stuff on Google calendar. It makes it easier to keep track of these things."
a8hr2j,"NTA, but he's not going to get you a Christmas gift.  

Expecting gifts for Christmas and your birthday is not at all unreasonable.  I wish that the very first time he skipped Christmas or your birthday you had made a real issue of it and made it clear you expected gifts on those two days.  

But at this point you've let this slide for so long that he is unlikely to change.

My concern would be- what example does it set for your kid if mom's birthday is ignored?  If mom has no presents on Christmas? 

Forget reminders, you need to talk to him about how you will function as a family."
a8hrtu,"Hooters. For Thanksgiving. My only hope is that this is a troll post.

If it helps, all of us endure some level of shit for family. Yours just seems particularly acute."
a8hup0,"ESH. Not wanting a relationship with someone who smokes weed is your decision to make, but trying to make your current partner stop doing it is not your place; if it’s that much of a dealbreaker for you, end the relationship, don’t try to control someone else’s life. Equally, it’s up to your girlfriend if she wants to smoke, but definitely a dick move to tell you she would stop and then do it without letting you know first. My opinion? You guys are probably better off seeing other people."
a8hvec,"NTA - but, you should let it go now. You can’t force someone to want to be there with you & he is in a relationship so would likely be getting pressure from his girlfriend to cool it. 

My gut feeling is that he’s not a nice person & just likes your attention so I would cut him off completely so you can be open to new friendships & relationships that are genuinely there for you and visa versa. Don’t let him hold you back stuck on the past. You deserved better. "
a8i04s,"NTA

Laura sounds like a real piece of work! She's the one who left her laptop out on the floor. You were doing her a favor by moving it. Besides, there's no guarantee that you actually broke it. It's possible her very old dell already had a janky HDMI port, and she used this opportunity to try and get someone else to fix it. You had no obligation to pay, especially after she treated you so poorly."
a8i0td,"NTA. You aren't obligated to date someone, for any reason. You aren't physically attracted to the guy, that's that."

a8i77s,[deleted]
a8i951,"ESH

They're the assholes for saying it was ""in God's plans"" at your brother's funeral, especially since they know you're not religious. But you're no better. You knew how shitty it feels to have someone say it's God's plan to you, and threw that back in their face during their daughter's funeral for the sake of petty revenge."
a8ifmq,"NTA I'm convinced that older people often just need something to be upset about in order to stay regular. Good on you for being so generous when you can, you can't please everyone all the time."
a8ilo5,"NTA, but I thought you were gonna be. "
a8j2tc,"NTA it’s your life, and only you should choose whether you stay or go, personally I think that you’re doing it right by slowly breaking the relationship slowly."
a8j474,"YTA. You shouldn’t have asked her to move in when you only knew her for a few weeks. It seems like you wanted to save or protect her but now that she’s saved, you’re not interested anymore. 

If you tell her to move out, does she know anyone else in your area that she can stay in? Does she have the funds for an apartment on her own?"
a8j4ia,NTA. Everyone let's people out of their life every once in a while man. Frankly if she didnt try to message you back after you dipped it's probably mutual. It's best to move on from here and have a happy life 
a8jeoe,"NTA. I think a little ""hey you good man?"" would have been nice but honestly, if he has the wherewithal to go actually puke in a garbage can instead of on the floor or on his bed, he's good enough to take care of himself.

On the other hand, if he isn't responsive or if he is too fucked up to puke in a trashcan on his own, you need to help. Sympathy aside, you have a duty in those situations to help save a life. Personal feelings aside, it's the right thing to do, and if you're ever in that situation and don't help, you're an asshole."
a8jl4r,"I mean he should probably just be able to enjoy making whatever he wants. That’s what YouTube is meant to be for, at least. Some criticism isn’t bad but saying that no one is enjoying his content isn’t really constructive"

a8kx6s,"NAH, but you're going to take a whole lotta tax hit by not rolling over your 401k

"
a8kz3i,"Pretty clear NTA. You're an adult and can make your own decisions. If your family doesn't understand needing some alone time, that's on them imo."
a8l4cf,"Well I think your over reacting a bit.

1. Your obviously friendly with the guy, I mean you did look after his dog and offer to do it again.
2. You've said you live in a nice neighborhood so forgetting to lock your doors isnt an issue.
3. He left a gift for you, so clearly wasnt opening your car for a malicious reason, more likely so he knew you would get the gift and not somebody else by mistake. 

I'd suggest that you politely inform him not to open your car again. In the future I'd recommend locking your damn doors and then this wont ever be a problem anyway, nice neighborhood or not, you should always lock your doors."
a8ladz,"NTA. I can't stand watching people eat in general, but if they have horrible manners, then it's even worse. Just keep eating alone, I say."

a8liu8,"NTA

But....


Right now is a very stressful time for both of you.  You are looking to be moving on with your life and you mother is about to be an empty nester.

Try to reiterate your conflicting schedules and keep your head down for now, but do not purposefully burn any bridges.  In other words try to maintain the status quo without big blow ups or confrontations.  

Trust has been violated, yet at the same time parental burden is heavy.  She probably does not fully understand the issues you face in your closeted lifestyle.  She also was not looking for causing hardship when she found out your secrets.  Mothers snooping into messages and through your sock drawer is just something that happens.  She did cross a line when bringing it up to others, but in her ignorance was that her way of trying to ask for support in a confusing time for her as well?  

Your mother cares for you.  There are many in her situation that might have thrown you out when they found out.  In fact there are many who do.  There is tension now, but this will most likely not always be the case."
a8lqby,NAH. Just brother-sister stuff. Relax. Either do it or don't. It literally does not matter.
a8ltc7,"""She blames my.....""

a8merl,"NTA. Your cousin sounds like a horrible person and parent. You were trying to do a nice thing for her son and she responded in the most petty, vindictive way possible. 

Please do stay in touch with them, if only for this little boy’s sake. It sounds sketchy that she seems to come down really hard on him for childish mistakes and if the situation gets worse as he gets older, you need to be there for him and possibly his older siblings too. 

And now you know that any presents from you need to come from you directly. Your aunt and your cousin can’t be trusted here.

She wasn't a good catch anyway.  She wanted a relationship for the good times only, and not the bad.  She wanted you to expend your emotional energy and support on her, but she wasn't willing to do the same to you in your time of need.

a8otui,NTA in the least. It’s on your bf to tell his friends to cancel their plans so he can keep his plans with you. This is a no brainer. And what a bunch of rude assholes his friends are for being late. I have no respect for people who can’t respect my time.

a8pnbr,"NAH

You didn't say anything wrong, they were just defensive and are maybe a little overly sensitive. 

You could have been ""nicer"" about it, I guess, but friends should welcome honesty and it's not like you were just insulting them, you were giving them an honest compliment. If they need people around them to sugar-coat everything or can't accept others opinions, that is unfortunately their problem."
a8pozc,"YTA if you think making an ultimatum will get you anywhere. Expressing concern, hurt and frustration are all valid feelings and should be brought up to one or both of your parents. But making them choose, that’s just childish. "
a8pygu,"NTA. I'm going to buck the trend here and say you're not the asshole. Normally I'd say it's the thought that counts and to be grateful etc., however, in this case, you have specifically told him well before the purchasing of the gift that you don't want jewellery as a gift. The fact that he did anyway tells me that he either isn't listening to you, or that he does listen and is going to do what he wants anyway. "
a8pyze,"YTA why can’t you friend have a new friend? I know gamers that met up irl and ended up best friends. Two separate occasions, completely different people"

You're hugely projecting about B and her family and you're making huge leaps about who they are just due to their (perceived) class. B met SS in prision...  do you think she doesn't know who she is marrying?

a8sojm,"NAH

It's very likely sexual.

Have you tried addressing him directly about it? Let him know in as neutral a way as possible that you won't be wearing cat ears for him and that you think it's inappropriate for him to keep asking you.

Explain to your boyfriend and their mother what the cat ears thing references so they understand why you react that way, and one of them can possibly address him about it more directly as well.

Playing along and not directly addressing it won't help the situation. Deciding to just not be around the brother is not a solution, as that is your boyfriend's family, and if you see a future with him, you have to at least try to find a real solution that doesn't involve cutting off someone he likely cares about."
a8ss5g,"NTA

I read “destination wedding” and was admittedly ready to side with the people not going...but you offered to pay for him? And then he won’t come because he can’t put down the pipe for less than a week?

That’s terrible. Keep your day how you want it. Replace “weed” with “alcohol” and see how weird this sounds. Anyone who can’t stop using a substance for that long has a significant problem.

Zul’gurub mount? Really? Honestly I gotta agree with you OP, that was fucked. Okay, rolling the mount out of spite, I get completely. Still dickish, but I get it. But after y’all left you really should have just given it to him. You won, and he ate crow. Granted it probably taught him a lesson to not be a dick, because I know all too well how it feels to get chewed out like that. But still, pretty messed up ESPECIALLY since you soulbound it right in front of him out of pure spite.

He leaves cereal bowls with all crusty milk and cereal down the side of the bed. Same with glasses of milk. He picks his toenails in bed and flicks them to the floor which is gross. Same with bogies.

a8ve7o,"YTA. You’re not thinking of your son first at all. You specifically mention how you mix up people’s gifts and tell your kid different things came from different people because you don’t like that they don’t prewrap and label them. I’m pretty sure they assumed you’d know who they came from with the return label. And if they weren’t the ones who shipped it and instead ordered it, how did you expect them to wrap it? Your family took the time to pick something out for your child and you’re being petty. 

As for your ex, again you’re being petty and the only person it’s going to hurt is your son. But you’re more focused on being upset at your ex. You may not agree with him not sending a birthday present as well, but it’s apparently something he’d already discussed with you/your child because he was planning on a bigger gift for Christmas. He’s perfectly within his rights to be excited and tell his kid what he got him.

Don’t try to mess up your kid’s Christmas to spite your ex. It just makes you look petty. "

Getting the kids to stop damaging the seats on the bus potentially saves everyone the expensive of paying for fixing the damaged seats, or having the rental company on the hook for getting the seats fixed/replaced earlier than usual.

a8wxbt,"NTA, not at all. You are learning stuff about how you function best and it's important to listen to that internal reminder! It's understandable that your mom isn't really getting that, and I don't think she's intending to be the asshole either. I'd maybe sit her down at a time when you're both relaxed and happy, and just lay out how stressful the semester is and what you need between stressful semester and full/chaotic home (although it sounds like you might have already done this). 

This is a totally fair boundary to set, and if she gets upset, I'd suggest kindly saying ""I'm here now, and I'm able to be fully present because I took a little time for myself, so let's enjoy it!"" And moving to a different topic. Hopefully she'll come to understand, but if she doesn't it is still not your fault."

Also, make sure to keep an eye on Fluffy - using the bathroom outside of the litterbox, subdued appetite, and excessive vocalization are all signs that something isnt right with your kitty. Sometimes this is caused by big changes like switching environments or, in case it happens, missing a caregiver they were attached to.
Fluffy seems to be settling in, but be alert for these signs in case they come up.

They likely weren't intending to disrespect you or ""spit in your face"" as you said they had to scrape money together to buy it, they didn't just buy one on a whim to fuck with you.

Some people don't understand or aren't familiar with the severity of some phobias and thus don't really have the capacity to take it as seriously as you would like. Maybe they just thought you really really don't *like* jewelry and thought ""But OP will like ours, because it's from us and we love them and have such great taste etc.""

You're not an asshole for telling them to take it back, if you did so kindly and respectfully. 

I have a fear of clusters of holes or circles, or deep small standalone holes sometimes. Seeing them or imagining touching them makes me want to rip my own face skin off my scalp. People laugh at me about it a lot.

My younger and older sister live in the same house with her. They've tried to help her too but she says I'm the only one she can talk to. I'm her support system, and yeah, I would definitely say I'm not emotionally put together enough to be anyone's support system, that's why I'm not in a relationship. If we're talking about how much effort I've put into trying to resolve this on my own, I would say I've done my best. I try to talk to her as much as possible about her problems but I feel like nothing I say really reaches her or creates practical change in the way she thinks. Which creates stress for me. Her mindset and attitude is constant downward spiral and getting to a point where as an every day person I feel helpless, so I feel like she needs to see a professional. If I sound like I feel guilty, I definitely do. I feel like every time I tell her to get help I'm shoving a family problem off on someone else. And if she does, God forbid, commit suicide, I would feel like it's my fault for not doing enough. 

I don't really think it's about what she deserves, I love my mom, I think she deserves the world. But I also think that I am at the limit of what I can support her through emotionally if that makes sense.  Does this answer your question? "
a909la,NTA. why would she get a gift if she purposely never gets anyone but her child one?
a90egv,"NTA. Its perfectly reasonable to want your money back especially if your friend kept saying he was going to pay you back. He was stringing you along. But just for future reference, never lend money (especially to friends or family) and expect to be paid back.

Your friend sounds exhausting. I can see why you don't want to spend time with her anymore. But have you ever actually asked her to complain less?

It's pretty rude to ghost a friend when you've given her no opportunities to change her behavior and have provided every indication that you don't mind the behavior.

Ask your friend to be more positive/complain less. If she doesn't change at all, then consider ending the friendship."

I was actually in a similar situation where I paid for a gift for someone, and they didn't get what I paid for and never told me until it was too late to fix. I was annoyed and felt like they didn't value my money. I would have been happy to make sure they got what I paid for if I had known what happened in time.

Your brother is struggling and I understand the impulse to give him hope, but lying will only eventually destroy your relationship with him.

What a retarded situation? I don't know what else to say, it sounds like Poe and most others in the Discord are really immature and as such, just disassociate yourself from it. No need to join back into the Discord just so you can berate him about ""creepy"" behaviour (I don't get this part, either. Are you using creepy as in he's trying to steal your art so he can ejaculate on it and send it to you in the mail, or do you just mean he seems a bit like a shady thief?) which hasn't actually really been proven yet anyway. 

I mean, you're not necessarily an asshole for your actions, but if you just left the Discord again and didn't join back everything would be the same. It's not like real life where you'd need to talk to the person/people about what happened, and apologise if you were the asshole - just leave and don't look back.

But let your brothers know if you’re going to tell your stepfather, and make sure you have some safety plan for your sister if needed. Also consider if you’re doing this because it’s the right thing to do, or because you (seemingly quite rightfully) are mad at your mom.

Not for being ready to move on from this relationship,  but for how you are handling it.

She is going to have emotional fallout you can't control. You can't be held hostage emotionally and you don't have an obligation to be in a relationship or friendship with someone you no longer like.

However,  you should do what you can to mitigate the damage.  If she had an older trusted parent or friend go to them and explain it to them. Let them know that you are making them aware of the situation so they can provide the emotional care she needs in a situation you regret.   Then be candid with her about your decision to cut ties."

I like having some bites with lots of curry and some bites without any at all. My husband understood where I was coming from and although he disagreed about how to eat curry, he was fine with me having my own plate to eat as a liked.

Whether or not they get a divorce is up to them, not you. And if they are both unhappy in the relationship (which we don't actually know...they might just be stressed), then divorce is probably the best option and might lead to a more peaceful home life. 

If you can, calmly explain your worries to your parents and how you see things. If you can't do it calmly, maybe write it down? It's worth having a conversation about. Maybe they don't realize how bad it's gotten? Sometimes fighting becomes normal for people and they don't realize how bad it is. "

Just poor communication. There is obviously a gap of expectations here. It's entirely possible that the realities of having you with them, both financially and on an interpersonal level were not something they understood when the arrangement was made. Obviously your understanding of the situation is not what ended up being the reality. 

I would sit down with them for a candid talk. I would ask them how the experience of you living there is going and has gone. What concerns do they have about financial matters.  Do they wish to continue? Be candid about your needs and feelings without being accusatory. Test the water to see if some compromises are possible. If they are not, set an expectation that you will search for a new situation (like finding someone who needs a room mate.)  Make sure to speak to your gratitude,  your needs, but acknowledge their needs and the fact that if in trying to help you they bit off more than they expected,  you are willing to make reasonable changes to the arrangement.

It's time to grow up. You're focusing on making excuses and lying to family about a difference in personal values and religious beliefs. An adult gets to make their own decisions about these things and can be candid about it. They have a right to not approve, but not a right to make you or him participate in uncomfortable situations to appease them. By doing this how you did, you set up this situation. 

You should have a conversation with your parents about your life choice and set boundaries firmly.

a96thg,"NAH  


I don't think your father is wrong to leave his possessions to his current wife. That said, your concerns are valid. I would make him aware of the possibility of creating a will that has only a ""life interest"" for his assets.  Life interests can be created in a number of different circumstances.  Often a Will is used to create a Testamentary Trust by giving a life  interest in an asset to a spouse (the “life tenant”) and the capital  residue left over to the children (the “residuary beneficiaries”) once  the life tenant dies.   


In such a situation his wife may still consume all of his assets.   This is likely if she outlives him for some time or if he doesn't have a great deal of assets. However, in the event that there are assets left over the residue would go to his children after her death.  She would be able to dispose of her own assets ( her half or things she had before the marriage etc) to her children as she wished."

This may be an unpopular opinion, but as someone with mental illness, I'd say that you should put your own self-care first.

That was a horrible thing to do and it is eating you up because you did a wrong thing. At this point, telling him what you did doesn't fix the situation. He still made a decision based on your lie.

I was in your situation with my current husband. He was with a girl who didn't treat him well. I was their friend.  I ended up with a huge crush on him.  He often came to me for advice as a friend.  I spent about a year carefully giving him advice to stay in his relationship and work on better communication skills.  I was the one friend who never said an unkind word about his ex because I wanted him to make his own mind up.   I did that because I believe that it isn't ethical to try to break up a couple to get a new relationship going. I think that a relationship founded on such an act probably won't end well. When they broke up naturally I waited a time... asked him out ... and we have had a happy 10 year relationship.

That said, in my opinion this is your burden to bear now. Telling him is going to fill him with indecision about his prior break up and distrust and pain about your betrayal. If it really was an incident, not a greater indication of your character and suitability as a partner ... him not knowing will spare him pain.  You can be the one to carry it because you did it. I don't believe you are necessarily a crap person or have a bad relationship because you committed one massive ethical crime.

If it \*was\* a greater indication of your character as a partner ... you will blow this relationship up in other ways soon enough, so it won't matter that you did this too."

Also, her friends don't just dislike you for no reason. She must be discussing aspects of your relationship to them. So the way they feel may be a result of what she shares with them. Friends are less forgiving then SOs, but they shouldn't  be meddling into others' marriages. So yeah everyone sucks here....

Looks like both of you need to work on trust and communicating better. Hope everything works out OP!

a9psfi,"First of all NTA

Second of all, you can't inherit debt

Third of all, you really needed to get that off your chest

Fourth of all, consider a support sub on Reddit. I like r/momforaminute and r/offmychest, they are the most positive support subs I've been to. 

Edit: fifth of all, I had alot of fun numbering my points (can you tell)"
a9q6e6,"Nah NTA. Feels like your sister did that out of spite. Pretty lame. She deserved to get a little shade from you. Just a slight reminder she’s not queen of the universe and other people live in the house, too. Let it go and don’t turn it into a thing, but rest assured, you acted appropriately."
a9q7f8,This is indicative of worse problems between the two of you if you wont spring 20 bucks for a wall mount and she is so upset by it. 
a9qbke,"YTA for sure. The first rule of those kinds of pranks is you *always* follow up with the real gift. I’m not surprised your sister was so hurt by your actions. I’m sure she was angry, crushed, and humiliated. 

You sound like a bitter person who resents his little sister. "
a9qd7m,"If she was loud that's one thing, but she's not being loud. There's no rule against it as well so, YTA."
a9qecb,NTA but.. I would assume that a guy was negging me if they said that.

No you shouldn't, not over something like this. She doesn't get to dictate what (common and perfectly harmless) words you can and can't use.

a9qhe6,"NTA except maybe to yourself =(

>My role in the friend group is the backbone, the person who keeps you grounded and listen to everybody's problems. I've never been the one to truly talk about my depression openly

>I drag my ass out of it and tell my self to stop being a bitch. The world doesn't owe you anything and it could be a lot worse.

Friendship is a two-way street, you deserve the same support you give your friends. And it doesn't sound like they refuse to give it, but like you refuse to open up about needing it. 

Even ""the strong one"" needs someone to lean on from time to time, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it and it doesn't make you a bitch or a pussy or any of those mean things you say to yourself. Being vulnerable is fucking HARD, it takes guts, especially if you're the type who tends to keep things to yourself. 

I get what you're saying about not wanting to drown in self pity, and it's good to keep things in perspective and know it could be worse - but just because it could be worse, or because someone else has it worse, that doesn't negate your right to feel sad/upset/whatever the fuck you want about your own situation. 

"
a9qk47,"INFO

A lot depends on your intent. 

If you’re trying to punish her or make her feel bad, and that’s why you’ve changed your behaviour, then YTA.

a9r51j,"NTA.  Just because someone asks for forgiveness doesn't mean that they are owed it.  However, you also say that you want to forgive her, and holding onto unwanted anger can be draining.  It might be best to talk to a therapist about this issue."
a9r5p9,"This is really marginal since no one is getting hurt or ripped off, but I feel that yes, YTA.  You're misrepresenting yourself to obtain a gain.  Also, if your little ruse ever come to light then you're fueling that ""There are no real women on the internet"" myth, something I've had to deal with myself because of guys like you."
a9r9kx,"I would say you’re NTA. It’s kind of a predicament but I think if you feel like you’re forcing yourself to hang out with someone, its not very genuine as you said and probably not enjoyable. If you just approach the situation with as much kindness as you can considering they have autism, I think its ok. Maybe you can figure out a time where it is a group situation once if you’d like. "
a9rfsn,You sound like the asshole to me 
a9rkuy,"NTA for not allowing people to stay in a rat infested cabin with a broken refrigerator.  Tents would be more comfortable than that, and you're saving others from a ruined weekend.  Your uncle can foot the bill to hire repairmen if he wants the cabin to be available for that month."

a9rx91,"ESH, I suspect. 

It was not okay of him to corner you like that. It wouldn’t have been okay if he did it to a man, either. That’s not how you handle work disputes. You were right to report him.

However, if what you said to him in the meeting is how ‘everyone’ talks at a hedge fund - you being worried about them hearing what you said makes me think otherwise. 

Of course they have to investigate, but you might want to brush up your resume.

Perhaps you could have handled it better, but I would hope that any third party watching would empathise with your outburst, especially if they are a parent themselves"
a9snvz,"YTA. *That* is the reason why you ended the relationship? Because she wanted to eat alone and not share your relationship with your coworkers? You wouldn't be an asshole for breaking up if you aren't compatible for one reason or another. But your stated reason is so petty, you've crossed the YTA line."
a9sqsw,NAH.  She has to worry about what's best for herself and her son before she can worry about you.  If you don't want to move to Arizona then don't.

a9t0y9,NTA. It sounds like your boyfriend needs to learn to set boundaries with his family. 
a9t2bl,"NTA.

OP, it sounds like you’ve had a terrible year. But that’s why we get married - not just so we have someone to share the good times, but so we have someone to comfort us during the bad times. It sounds like he’s forgetting the “for worse” part of the deal."
a9t39a,"NAH

It's nice she cares and what a wonderful person for helping out so much but she does need to start being a bit more respectful towards both of you. You don't have to talk to anyone that often (4 phone calls a week does get a bit much) so maybe you could agree to schedule two phone calls a week that you both know and can expect. 

It's a hard situation and I get it - my grandma isn't nearly this bad but she pulls these power plays where she is super nasty towards me or my bro to other members of the family and then the next minute offers help with school and with him has helped him over and over throughout his extremely troubled life. 

Honestly it's kind of an old person thing and an old country thing to just constantly rag on your young descendents. These people see it as being constructive (idk how or why!) because they think they are ""inspiring"" you to be better somehow. Since she has clearly showed lots of love and care and support I would say maybe cut her some slack but still set boundaries because she is also still being negative. You don't have to think she's the best person ever but go a little easier on her and make *some* time for her. Everyone is struggling here to be a good family member in their own way I think."
a9tbe8,"NTA - tailgating is a serious offence and if you don't feel safe due to someone being dangerously close, then you need to slow down yourself - so you can, in an emergency, slow down at a slower rate and minimise the chance of an accident. 

If someone wants to overtake, they should go into the outer lane, you don't need to move or get someone to undertake you (it's, illegal in most countries, dangerous and unexpected for other road users, thus making a potentially dangerous situation)

You behaved absolutely correctly and the moron beeping his horn need to get some karma payback! "

Except for the assaulter obviously.

Maybe it caused a scene but hopefully it helped the case! I agree with your decision - the misinterpretation had a TOTALLY different meaning. Good on you."
a9u0bs,NTA. I’d just reply back “Based on advice from <obnoxious family member> we will be staying home for Xmas.” Then enjoy a quiet period at home with your beautiful newborn. Mother and newborn would appreciate the rest. 
a9u0ys,NTA - You asked to have a conversation about it. She only had the conversation when she was caught and did so after lying. She also continued to lie until she finally came out with it. 
a9u2zi,"YTA

If you do not want to visit, just don't visit. She wasn't kind to you and you don't owe her any of your time if she is undeserving. It seems a bit cruel to mess with what's left of her memory just so you don't have to visit anymore. For the record, I think it's fine to pay someone to spend time with her. I work in a facility like this and people pay for someone to be there when they can't. The person usually enjoys having some company but the lying part is what puts it over the top."
a9uaii,NTA.  You dodged a bullet. And I am saying this as a female. 
a9uckd,"NTA. I find it very odd that he seems to be distancing you from his daughter. While he and his ex-wife should definitely be making decisions together for the daughter, you are supposed to be part of his life now. If he isn't even communicating these things to you, yet expecting blind support, I would say that's a major red flag in my eyes. As you said, you and he are supposed to be a team. What's happening is that he and his ex-wife are a team and you're just somebody on the sidelines."
a9udb6,"NTA - For thinking it, nah, that's okay. You might not want to tell him that directly, maybe with a counselor. Speaking of, perhaps you might need to look for one for yourself or the marriage. 

&#x200B;

That sounds emotionally taxing. "
a9uhm4,"NTA,  your mom is free to be friends with whoever,  but talking about you to an ex on a regular basis is not cool, and sending you a pic of the new bf is beyond not cool, wading into the waters of crazy.  

Stop telling your mom whats going on in your life, apologize for skipping the holidays, but keep whatever stuff you dont want the ex knowing to yourself, your mom obviously has no idea how hurtful she's being. "
a9ujbw,Nta. He’s using this to get people to buy his stuff. He’s still keeping 80%. Not saying he doesn’t actually care but. Bidness is bidness
a9unbs,Update: I tried to talk to him again to clear the air and he yelled at me more. He said that I am straining our relationship and claimed that he did not say anything rude to me. I bought the ticket. 
a9uqah,"NTA for being upset, YTA for telling him he's disrespecting your mom. 

It is EXTREMELY hard to go from being someone in a marriage to alone. It's scary, and lonely.   
He should not force his relationship on you, but he has to be allowed to move on. "

a9uxuw,"So, you:

1. Knew your partner was traumatised by a cheating SO, and
2. Promised (can’t stress that word enough) to not cheat, and
3. Broke that very promise,
4. Cheated on him, and
5. Didn’t come clean, and
6. Cheated again, with 2 other people,
7. Attracted an STD while you were at it, and
8. When he tried to work through it, you continued to talk to who you cheated with, and 
9. Blame him for what he said and did when he found out you’re cheating, while you solely created the situation you’re in, and
10. After he decides you have no place in his life while he works through this trauma, you continue to talk to his mother behind his back, and
11. When he is ready to respond and get the things off his chest he needs to, you are nowhere to be seen to face your fuck-up like an adult. 

I hope I never go through what your ex has gone through.

a9uzm2,"NTA

you can still be friends with her but dont throw it in his face - at least give him 3-6 months to get over it.  Just dont talk about her to him. He doesn't need to know.

a9v2yk,"NAH. Your mum is worried about you, it's what they do. And you haven't said anything else about her being controlling or abusive, so I don't think she's an asshole. At the same time, you enjoy the job and like your co-workers so it makes sense that you'd want to stay. Talk to your mother, preferably when you can show her that the job isn't impacting your studies, and reassure her that you'll stay safe. She'll probably still worry, but that's what good parents do."
a9vae1,"NTA. If your elderly cat is now deaf, blind, and “howling”, you can bet the animal is leading a fairly miserable existence. I think putting it down would be the humane option. "
a9vdwy,"While I’d usually agree with you about my shitting on bio parents... I don’t here. 

First, The stepdad isn’t trying to poison the relationship with the father. The father did that when he excluded his own daughter from a trip to Disney land. 

Second, the daughter needs to know that this kind of behavior isn’t okay. If no one stood up for her/told her that the dad’s actions are wrong, she would accept it as normal. And that’s NOT normal. Allowing her to think that being excluded by her father is normal sets her up for major boundary issues in the future. No one told me the shit my extended family said to me was wrong to “keep the peace” and I ended up letting people walk all over me as a teenager because I thought that was acceptable behavior. 

Third, it is his business. If he’s been dating the GF for 4 years and she’s 7, hrs been involved in the daughter’s life since she was three. Given he himself took her to Disney, it obvious he plays a parental role in this girl’s life. Parental figures need to stand up for their children, even if they’re step-kids. 

OP doesn’t seem to be using the kid as a weapon in the divorce. He seems to genuinely care about this child and is upset that her father is treating her like shit. I don’t love how he handled the situation, it was kind of immature, but his heart was in the right place and he is NTA. The bio dad is. A trip to Disney as a 7 year old isn’t petty. That’s a big deal and she was excluded from that, which I’m sure would make her feel excluded from the family. "

a9vkj4,"NTA. You said her husband won't even acknowledge that you exist and she told her family not to acknowledge you. Where were all these concerned family members then? Then to use your grandfather as emotional blackmail like that is absolutely unacceptable. Fuck her, fuck him and fuck the rest of your family for picking and choosing when they want to be concerned about family."
a9vsto,"NTA.  She is being emotionally abusive.  It's beyond reasonable what you have been doing, and it sounds like she is trying to isolate you from other people and hobbies to have you fully focused on her.

As soon as you called her on it and she expected consequences, she changed her tune to draw you back in.  The sudden nature of the change and lack of respect for your desire for space implies that she will continue to erode your autonomy if you go back.

Protect yourself and break it off."

a9vyo9,"INFO Your boyfriend brings home 4000$ a month, keeps 3000$ and all that money can’t pay his share of monthly costs and debts? So you’re collectively spending over 6000$ a month on living expenses but are not married or have kids? I would say first and foremost that you are living outside of your means, when planning a financial future with a S/O it’s important to take into account each other’s debts and plans to solve them, why are your living costs so high if he has a lot of debt while you don’t mention any on your end?

You don’t share a bank account and don’t help him with his debts (which you are in no way obligated to do) therefore you don’t have a say over what he does with his money. His take home budget is not 4000$ despite what you know he makes, it’s 3000$ for him, you need to plan for that.

It’s important for him to provide for his mother, you mentioned her travelling to Asia every year, I’m assuming he is from an Asian family, where it can happen to be the norm to care for parents once you have a career and have the means to do it.

Some people like having relationships where the give/take of personal favors is much higher and some people prefer less, the important thing is that your friends respect your boundaries and don't *expect* you to give significantly more effort than they do.

Now for some unsolicited advice for how to deal wirh these requests. When people say they'll be visiting your area, simply say you'd love to see them while they're there. If they directly ask you to host, tell them that you're not able to host at your place.

You two are doing the thing I had to go to therapy in order to stop doing.

&#x200B;

Stop. Comparing. Each. Others. Hardships. To. See. Who's. Shit. Stinks. More.

&#x200B;

Are you two a couple? Or fuckin' room-mates?

Are you in this together, or are you not?

&#x200B;

You need to understand that her going to school is not just for her. If you two are serious, this is for both of you. This is for your futures. Not just hers, both of you. Always always remember that.

If you continue to do this it will literally take over everything. You'll be using it in arguments to get your way. It leads down a bad path. Once I broke myself of this, me and my wife's relationship improved ten-fold.

&#x200B;

I signed up for this, I said ""I Do"". And if that means my wife needs to take a few weeks off of working so she can spend time at home and mentally recharge (we also have a 3 year old) then so be it, because I know when I need a break my wife will support me.

&#x200B;

You guys aren't assholes, you're just experiencing relationship anxiety. It'll be okay. You just need to stop comparing her to you. Because she's not you. And you're not her.

&#x200B;

Love her for what she is, not what she could be.

&#x200B;

And if what she is isn't good enough, there's no amount of screaming or talking you can do to change that. She has to change herself. But personally, this is completely normal, and you two will hopefully come out unscathed, and stronger. Let her take some time off.

a9yngz,"Well.... ESH.

He needs to get a job. Even if it’s one he doesn’t love. Why’s he so worried that a job will make him sick? He may need to work fast food for a bit, or carer or cleaner.

And you need to learn to drive. You have proof he is looking through the email so why keep asking him about that?

Have you offered help with his resume? Asked coworkers where they suggest he apply?"
a9yyxm,"NTA for being upset I suppose but step back for a second and consider the fact that you are a grown man with a wife and kid and you have an entire room in your home dedicated to your collectibles. Sounds like your wife is pretty tolerant/accepting of your hobby, you could try to be a bit tolerant/accepting of her family needing a place to stay and not get so worked up over this."
a9zifu,"Woman here. From my perspective my vote was NAH. Sure it hurts, but I feel as long as he's honest about the situation (rather than ghosting) it's okay. Sure she'll be hurt, but consider his feelings too. He needs to start the process of getting over his feelings, and that will be much harder while keeping her in his life.
I really doubt he doesn't care, as you say. I think the issue is that he cares too much. "

a9zs6z,YTA. Not because you won’t share your baby’s name. But rather because in general you seem selfish and ungrateful to your sister.

aa02cj,"YTA I hate people who think they can impose rules on a game. Especially in an arcade. If the game allows it, it is legal. If you are mad you got stomped by a kid, or mad that he won't play by your rules that is a maturity issue."
aa04ya,"No, you're NTA. But I would say choosing to blatantly ignore him and his gifts could have been more harmful than helpful.

 Yeah, it's easier to not even interact with him but that's really not feasible when he is a relative you will have to see or engage with some frequency. While I agree that pushing for him to get help, if you truly believe he's mentally ill, is a good thing for the sake of his mental health and family cohesion I think you will need to learn to interact with him in a non-inflammatory manner. Simply put, be the bigger person."
aa05iy,NTA. What you did wasn’t wrong since it was before the relationship. His reaction is understandable but he shouldn’t really cut you out if his life.
aa06bc,"NTA.  She has positioned herself as a friend rather than a romantic partner, so there's nothing wrong with making that a reality. "
aa07lj,"NTA, you two need to be separated."
aa088e,"ESH.

Your sister in law is undoubtedly a massive asshole. However, you were not completely defenseless here. You have a baby who is only 3 months old and you could have...

a) left the party

b) if SIL insisted on taking the baby, you could have physically refused her. I would have DEFINITELY raised a fuss. Your daughter cannot stand up for herself. You need to champion for her and keep her safe. Get a backbone. 

c) ""She's too small to get the flu."" This is where you let SIL know that shit won't fly. 

In the future, I hope you don't let your family push you around. You have the right to be annoyed and angry but you also could have done more to prevent this from happening. People won't always listen to your requests and when that happens, it's time to put your foot down. "
aa0x1y,"NTA, quiet hours tend to mean you shouldn't (not can't) be playing loud music, watching a loud movie or screaming. You were just doing normal things at what I assume was a reasonable noise level.

aa1qpw,"NTA.

aa2f3i,"YTA 

You're at fault for laughing at someone else's grief/misfortune/loss. You say you couldn't control it - okay, let's say that's true.

What you should've done was *apologize*  and explain you were laughing at the situation, not at him, his feelings, or his loss. 

But you didn't. You didn't take responsibility for yourself."
aa2z07,"NTA it was an off hand comment, not even a lecture. You stated that water is better for you than anything else she is drinking which is objectively true. You know you're NTA, there was no personal attack at all in what you said. "
aa32hw,"NTA

You shouldn’t feel like an asshole for saying no to something that’s not even your responsibility. You have your own life and your own things, which should come first. It sounds like she’s taking advantage of you since you agreed to do it a few times. If she gets upset at you saying no, then she’s the asshole. It’s her child, her responsibility. "
aa32qb,"NTA. It should be common sense to be careful when putting heavy books on top of anything that is not a heavy book. And just to be safe, was there really no other place he could have put the books? Like, why risk it? Default place for heavy books if there's no shelf is the floor, never on top of something that's not meant to carry other things. I agree with you that lack of respect isn't just when you purposefully damage something but also when you recklessly do so because you don't think at all. Any time you touch someone else's belongings directly or indirectly, you need to at least think a little."
aa34kx,"NAH honestly. You're justified in feeling the way you do, but I get the feeling your sister is just mad at herself. I don't think she is meaning to blame you. More blame herself for not being there. Not that it would have changed anything. But it's some we do as humans. We question our choices. I don't think a confrontation would be a good idea as it would just drive a bigger wedge between you.
Also, I'm really sorry for your loss. It sounds like you did everything you could."
aa36et,"NTA.  

When you drive a company owned vehicle, you should expect to get reported when driving like an asshole, so you were in the right.  

As an aside, this reminds me of my old Army buddy, who was the greatest IRL troll I've ever known.  He not only enjoyed fucking with people, he was a goddamn Mozart of trolling.  

He drove a new white truck as his personal vehicle, so since work trucks are usually white, he got a custom bumper sticker -- one of those ""report my driving"" ones with his own cell phone number on it.  As we were driving down the road, if he cut someone off he'd get a call from an angry driver.  

""Oh yes sir.  We've had problems with this guy for a while now.  This is the final straw.  We let him slide for a while now because he has 4 kids and his wife has cancer, but this is it.  I don't care if it's right before Christmas, he's getting fired today.  I'm sure he will figure out how to pay for his wife's chemo somehow.""   "
aa3lp1,"NTA, they can't get offended in place of your mom. They didn't pay either, they can't act like they have some moral high ground."

aa4wht,"NAH - I think your boyfriend has a mature outlook and wants nothing to do with it, which is right and a good characteristic. He should not want anything to do with him, but he’s acting as the bigger person and showing him how good you will be with him. He’s smart.

aa6u98,"YTA. It must be incredibly hurtful for your aunt to watch her son be excluded, *by family,* over things he can't really control. Even if *he* doesn't express it *you're hurting her*. She isn't asking you to rearrange your life. She's simply asking you to bond with your autistic cousin as you do with your other cousins. If it's for one week you guys should definitely hang out with him and find activities that accommodate his interests and disabilities. You made plans that you knew would preclude him from participating in, even though you knew he would be there. That was rude"

aa7kjw,YTA - it’s way worse of a feeling to realize that you’ve been pitied and lied to for months than it is to know your feelings aren’t reciprocated. 
aa7upi,"NTA. There is no fucking reason why your parents should be saying that to you. You obviously love your fiance and you as your fiance you don't have to keep things from him.

Your mom is definitely an asshole for doing this. Especially since she didn't really apologize and basically tried to guilt you."
aa82yt,"NTA if you’re genuinely concerned about her health but it seems pointless. You’re not a doctor. Maybe she has a brain injury or maybe she has a mood/personality disorder.

aa865q,"ESH, and hear me out. I don't think you were an *asshole* per se, but I think you were being a little insensitive, and slightly overlooking the purpose of the thread. I also think that the attacking got to you a little too personally, and you were possibly more defensive in your (rational) sentiment than you could have been. 

As a woman who would be considered progressive, I think generalizations in any direction are ridiculous. Even if they're meant to be hyperbolic, or even jokes, I think they're unproductive, and don't do anything for the modern feminist movement. What does shitting on all men accomplish? 

But, I also see where they're coming from when they accuse you of ""hijacking"" the thread. It's not a political debate, and it's just not the time or the place to debate semantics. By choosing **that** thread to voice your opinion on the ""all men"" generalization, you come across as defensive, and it does paint the picture that you're more concerned about how men appear in this situation, than how the victim feels. 

Now, I don't think that's what you meant, nor was that how you felt. I just think you felt too defensive, and made the problem about you, and politics, when it was meant to be a rant for those women. It wasn't right of them to make generalizations in the name of anger, but it wasn't right of you to ""hijack"", so to speak."

It's understandable that you may be disappointed they didn't like your idea but it unfair to be angry at them.  The person that didn't like the game that much anyway is essentially saying that starting over would diminish their enjoyment of the game to the point that they wouldn't want to play.

aa8oql,YTA.  You took their fun tradition and made it all about you because you disliked their jokes.  Sure it may have been immature but then you should’ve said something to your husband later in private.  Not made a scene on the hike.  You ruined the mood and that wasn’t cool.  You didn’t have to like their jokes but you could have respected their time together instead of blowing up and then stomping off like a child.  Talk about awkward.

They came to visit you, you should be planning things enjoyable for everyone. At the very least once your sister was upset and things were already stressful you should have gone home with them. If showing your dad this bar was important, you and him could have come back the next day when there were things for your mom and sister to do. Sounds like you found it inconvenient that your sister was 17 so you just wanted her to go away so you could party like you wanted to, rather than appreciating their visit."
aa98r9,"Nta

I feel terribly unqualified to give you any advice. I just wanted to tell you that trying for 10 years doing all that you are doing for your family makes you a great guy. But not wanting to do it forever and needing to move on does not make you a bad guy either.

Considering the lasting effects this situation may have on all of you, especially your child, I think working through this with a family therapist would be a good idea. Your wife may need to apply for disability in order to live without your support. That can be a long process. Perhaps those 2 things would be a good place to start. 

You’re not an asshole. The situation is an asshole."
aahey9,NTA its not unreasonable to want to be the only person your partner is intimate with. 
aahkj8,"NTA even in the slightest. Just because he's a child doesn't mean he has any sort of priority on using the restroom. 

edit: Even if it wasn't an emergency for you and you just kinda had to pee, you have every right to go in and not let him cut"
aahmnv,"If I'm reading this correctly, I'm going with ESH.

What is with the need to call each other that much?  Is this long distance?  8 months and you're making appointments.

She overreacted to you, instead of telling the truth, which is ,""hey, I'm going to catch up on some sleep instead of calling. .""

 You overreacted by trying to cancel a date with her as a way of trying solve her reason for being upset.  Not a smart way to go about it.

This all sounds very dramatic anyway, and you need sometime apart.  Not on the phone."
aahurs,"If you're blinding people YTA, fix your lights

After Edit: NAH "
aahvsc,"YTA. I understand this is your friend and you do have a right to hang out with him, I won't deny that.

But I think it is really shitty to make jokes about her when you know that it will get back to her and his parents. It almost sounds like you know you're undermining the relationship and brushing it off because the parents like you better."
aai3s2,"NAH, I suppose? But you might want to think about this:

Um... OP, are you sure it was Nazi imagery, and not Buddhist imagery?

The swastika (I believe *swastik* or *svastika* in Sanskrit) is a common symbol, and it's prevalent in Chinese and Japanese Buddhism as well. The Nazi symbol took a religious symbol of intellect and strength, the clockwise swastika, and rotated it 45 degrees. I have reason to believe that the symbols on the rug that you observed weren't secret Nazi identifiers.

Edit: added judgement"
aaijwe,"NTA if your physically sick, you shouldn’t be out spreading the virus you should be home in bed. It would be extra taxing on you with the language barrier, and could make you feel worse for the rest of the trip "
aailul,"NTA, you don’t owe them free skilled labor"
aajf6c,NTA. You gave her plenty of options. She was being weird about not speaking up. You’re fine.
aajm28,Nta
aajmzg,"NTA, not everyone likes kids and it's not your baby so they shouldn't force you to help out....but please don't talk about the baby so negatively when they're born. The baby didn't ask to be here, don't make them feel unwelcome and unloved in their own home. The baby obviously won't understand immediately, but in 2 or so years they will. If you don't think you can do that then it's probably best that you don't live there."
aajr1o,"I’m gonna play devils advocate and say 50/50 but this is a more relationship-centric problem. Some people may call your boyfriend an asshole but i don’t think that’s fair - having a negative reaction to a long term ex is completely normal and extremely common. 

Everyone likes to pretend that they’d be cool about it and frankly, a lot of people THINK they will be. But when the time actually comes it becomes a different story entirely. 

You guys need to talk it out. But honestly, I would not be surprised if your current BF asked you to cut off contact. And while that’s still your decision entirely and you have no obligation to listen, it’s pretty hard finding a significant other who is 100% okay with you keeping a close friendly relationship with a long term ex. "
aak2km,"NTA - good riddance by the sound of it, and that whole ‘blood is thicker than water’ nonsense is a crock of shit - I have some extended family members and if they were on fire I wouldn’t waste my piss on them"
aak4mu,"YTA. I don’t really like getting hugged by people I barely know either, but it sounds like this woman was just trying to be friendly and the way you went about declining the hug was rude and cold. There are way more polite ways of declining a normal social interaction. She probably felt like an outsider amongst her husband’s friends to begin with and you just reinforced to her that she should feel insecure."
aakb8e,"Yeah YTA you did zero to encourage any kind of inclusion. You just snapped at someone for not immediately involving your kid, a stranger. Who knows why she wasnt immediately invited to play?  You do your kid a massive disservice if your immediate assumption is that every thing in her life that is not ideal is because of her disability. Accusing someone you don't know of being afraid of her is a great way to instill in her the idea that she should expect other people to be afraid of her because of her condition. Why not step outside and encourage your kid to make an effort to involve herself?

I would have been upset and left if I had been the other parent too."
aakco6,"NTA. Clearly. Assuming everything you've written is true, you should have cut her out of your life long ago. Sounds like she's doing a good job of alienating a lot of people. Try to keep in contact with your brother, as hard as that might be. He'll probably need your help in a few years."
aalib7,YTA. Patients don’t make money off your organs. Any perverse disincentives don’t benefit the people who are dying every minute because of the many problems w the organ donation system materially and philosophically. You have no excuse and no amount of bad faith opining can make it the right choice to let someone else die when you could save them at no cost whatsoever to yourself. Grow up. 
aalrfr,"NTA, it is a fine request. If the waitress felt uncomfortable I would have requested to speak with a manager. Not to get the waitress in trouble, but to ask the manager if the request could be met."
aalude,YTA for letting a 12 year old walk all over you. He's a fucking brat so you reward him by taking him out to eat and buying him a video game? Sounds like you're part of the problem. 
aam3wd,"NTA. You decided that you were the proverbial fifth wheel in that group, that they didn’t appreciate your efforts, so you decided to stop trying. There’s nothing wrong about that. "
aam47k,NTA. They neglected the relationship. You are under no obligation to work to restore it. 
aam6js,"NTA, your reaction to the situation is not indicative of “this guy needs therapy” and CPS would have laughed in ML face.

1. You are tired.
2. Your wife is tired and just gave birth.
3. Your in laws seem to be hurting more then helping your first newborn experience (they should not be staying with you...helping is bringing meals and gtfo). 

Focus on your wife. Whatever level of exhaustion/stress your experiencing just know that she is at the same level + in pain + is going through some pretty extreme hormonal changes. Your wife needs you. Next time you go out get her something. Take photos with you her and the kid. Have alone time with just the 3 of you. BOND.

Your ML is the asshole here. She had a simple task, nearly burnt your apartment down, and threatens you? Bitch you started a fire in the middle of the night you are number one candidate for person who should be nowhere near this situation. "
aamf0r,[deleted]
aamjg3,[deleted]
aamn8r,"NAH. Assuming you are an adult, stay or leave, it's up to you. But, your father probably *really* looked forward to seeing you and spend time with you. Leaving early very well may hurt him. Just so you know. I know it would hurt me if I were in his position."
aamnjv,"NTA: your mom already told you and your sister you can have them. And, your brother hasn’t known this woman for very long, if things don’t work out, your family heirloom is gone! Your bro should not be making your mom feel guilty. If he wants to propose so badly and is so in love, then the cost ring itself should not matter, he should by what he can afford for now. He can always get her a bigger/more expensive ring later. "
aamqph,ESH its a crap situation. You could have some empathy and your sister could grow up a little. Your mom should send the money back.

aamyco,"NTA

Explain to her that you love her, you don't want to enable her, and that you want to be part of the solution, not the problem

Good luck, try to say no every time"
aan0g7,NTA. But you should probably expect for some family members to boycott your bday party as a result.
aanajl,"NTA. In fact, you should probably tell him before his employers find out"
aanbzi,"NTA You should have done some due diligence and said $30 first. All this said and given the context, it’s not your fault for not doing that. I don’t think it’s a real asshole move on you. A good friend should understand though (idk your finances,) but it’s maybe a little cheap at this level. The trip isn’t more fun having your friend. I’d pay $15 to see a friend especially one that lived far away."
aanejq,"I think the idea is he needs pants long enough to cover his tracking ankle monitor, not that he's not wearing any pants at all"
aanma8,"NAH.

Elope - trust me (experience) - it’ll be the best thing you’ve done. I also was in a situation of multiple countries as you are in.

That said, have a party later to celebrate the union when it is financially and scheduling available. People like the reception better anyways and since it would be a party vice a wedding, you’ll save some $$$."
aanmd9,"YTA - people who work in the movie theatre aren't there to clean the place, they do it because they have to due to people like you. "
aanrah,"NAH. Sometimes life presents you with tough decisions. I’m sure you would love to go if you could, but at the end of the day, you do have yourself to look after.

That said, it is a REALLY tough decision. I missed my brothers graduation for a similar reason, but a wedding seems a little more important. I just don’t know what to tell you."
aanthn,"NTA 

Driving an unreliable vehicle three hours away would not be wise. You could both end up stranded, and you could wind up paying a good penny for emergency towing/repairs. 

She made the irresponsible choice to strand herself without a ride back and is hoping you’ll risk your vehicle to make up for her bad decision. 
"
aantmx,YTA but not for the reason you think. You shoved your fingers down his throat. That's a complete different feeling from a blowjob.  Now he has an inaccurate representation and his throat probably hurts
aanu7r,"NTA. You can want him out, but ultimately it's not your house, so you can't decide that. Hope all you want though, maybe try expressing this to your parents."
aap7f3,[deleted]
aap8vj,"NTA. He's unreliable and your relationship isn't very stable to begin with.

You didn't explicitly say anything about it, but never stay with someone ""for the kids"". The most it does is give your kids bad relationship role models. And that's if you're lucky."
aaphio,"NTA. She doesn't sound like much of a friend, tbh."
aapn1o,"NAH, from what I can glean, you have a baby, you're both tired, you're both probably frustrated with normal stuff that couples get frustrated with, totally run of the mill. I'd suggest trying to be positive when you want to bitch. Think of it as cognitive behavioral therapy. 

You think, ""FUCK I'm tired of waking up to soothe the baby,"" but as soon as you think that try, ""I'm so grateful I have a family and this is what it takes!"" If you think, ""My wife is being passive aggressive and it's annoying the shit out of me!"" Tell yourself, ""She's just as tired as I am, gotta let it go!"" 

Unless she's like overtly being abusive... that's a different story, but it sounds like you're both just agitated and need some perspective. Try to be more positive when everything in you wants to complain or be frustrated.

It may sound stupid but if you try to combat the negative thoughts with positive ones they take up less space in your brain. Works for me. 😊

Edit: OMG please don't even for one second pay attention to the asshole who said she might be cheating. He's clearly a moron and projecting his own issues."

aaql28,"i’m gonna say NAH, but it does seem like you made a much bigger scene out of the situation by storming out. "

If I were the property manager I'd certainly want to know if a renter's shitty behavior was going to keep my other tenants from renewing their leases.

aas5yq,"NAH.

You shouldn't have blown up like that, but I get it, all of that emotion pent-up sometimes comes out like that. It sounds like your mom was just trying to look out for her friend, and be kind, but you consider her annoying. And you had some time off, and wanted to spend it with your mom, that's totally fine. 

You could also try to plan events ahead of time if stuff like this happens more than once. It probably would have helped to talk about it as well, instead of storming out. Just a calm, polite, talking session where you tell her that you want to spend more time with her."
aasbl5,NAH - it's your paycheck that you earned - not obligated to pick it up so you can be pressured to spend it participating in an activity you'd rather avoid. You're all good
aascah,"YTA. 
I can understand your grief and anger, but wishing death on a relatively large group of people for commiting OWI's is extreme. Just imagine if we had a judicial system that immediately sentenced those offenders to death. 

I'll be honest, I was in a pretty bad place several years ago and was charged with an OWI after a failed vehicular suicide attempt. I could have died then; I was trying to die. But I'm glad I didn't.

On the other side of the coin, this year I lost a friend to a drunken driver. He had stopped to help somebody with a flat tire and was struck on the side of the road. Does it make me furious? Yes. Am I glad he's being convicted? Yes. Do I wish him dead? No.

People grow; they learn and change, they dig themselves out of the ruts of addictions and terrible life situations. Not always - but you have to have the grace to give them that chance to be a better person. These people didn't wake up in the morning bound and determined to take a life. Most of the time, they're lost, sad, confused characters struggling to get through the day. Young, inexperienced children on the cusp of adulthood that didn't know what they were risking. They're not innocent, but they don't deserve death. 

Let it go. "

&#x200B;

I'm gonna mention something which might not make sense. Firstly, the basic human right is to be valued and have things explained to you *however* this does not mean that this person will give you an explanation. This is a real harsh reality but it's true.

The fact that her reasoning changes each time just shows you how deceptive she's being.

Personally I don't see the excuse of drinking/doing drugs making you cheat, my theory is you would have had to have that feeling to do so, so the drink/drugs gave you confidence to carry it out.

You seem like a decent person and you deserve to find someone who values that, she obviously does not. It's gonna be a new year soon so fuck these people and work on your self development.

It is controlling and also you can’t be there to babysit her through life and protect her from every perceived threat because you aren’t sure she can handle it.

You've got lots of empathy, great quality to have

He's a huge prick and he deserves to know that he is. The boyfriend has a right to know. See if you can convince them to confess because relationships especially ones with a god damn mortgage deserve way more respect than your friend and the girlfriend are giving it

As for you and your friend, I don't know how long you've been friends for or how close you are, but I'd talk to him to let him know why he's a prick if he doesn't get it and if he doesn't help get the word out to the boyfriend then idk if I'd wanna be friends with someone like that

aazp1w,"NTA. I'd be careful about just telling everyone. Someone who has child porn is unhinged. But I would find a way for that to get out, maybe a call or two. Not because of revenge but because people need to know he had child porn. That's predatory behavior."
aazy5e,"NAH.  You're not a selfish bitch and your husband has a serious concern. Find a counselor ASAP.  If your husband won't go, go alone. This is really too complex and important a conflict for you to let the internet resolve it. Sending you a hug in a heartbreaking situation.  "

ab1v93,"NTA. I hate the argument of ""Well if you don't like -blank-, why do you follow it?"". It's a stupidly lazy statement, and it implies that nobody outside the bubble of those who agree are allowed to criticise what people post. 

You follow what you want to follow on social media. The fact they're calling you a hypocrite for voicing your opinion on something you disagree just because you follow them is extremely close-minded. 

Social media, like it or not, is all about voicing opinions. People need to realize that in posting something, you're inviting the good and the bad, and need to know how to handle them both."

She shouldn't have put herself in this situation and she certainly shouldn't take her frustration at the situation out on you. She shouldn't expect you to be her therapist while ignoring your suggestions on ways to make it easier.

On the other hand it sounds a lot like you're not really doing anything to help beyond saying she should stop, which she's made clear is not an option she wants. I mean you seem to have carefully avoided saying you aren't helping at all, not even to provide immediate comfort and reassurance. People who are having panic attacks don't need to hear life advice, they need to hear reassurance and calm. That's not a lot to ask.

You want my advice, sit her down and have a proper conversation about how this makes you feel and what the two of you can do to make it better for both of you. You need to be more comforting in the moment when she's panicking and she needs to take your advice on board and consider how her relentless pursuit of her goals affects her mental health and the lives of the people around her. Maybe you could help ease her burden in some way, even something small at home so she's got less on her plate.

ab2c9q,"Sure, it's childish of him to use this birthday party to act out. But why would you completely cut ties with him over a wedding?

It's her responsibility to get help for her anxiety issues from trained professionals (if they are so bad that it's affecting her daily functioning, which it sounds like it is); going untreated and pushing the blame for her actions on other people is unfair to literally everyone in the situation, and her friends are doing her no favors by enabling her."

ab3ins,NTA Anyone who threatens suicide you should be careful around that’s very manipulative and toxic behavior. It’s a sticky situation but I think you have a right to decline going to a funeral of a person you’ve never met especially if could cause family drama or questions. The fact that he immediately turned on you and said you were a bad friend is also something you would be cautious of in the future. 
ab3osr,"NTA / SHP - based on the post, it seems reasonable that you wouldn't want to keep rooming with an ex, especially if you've been paying for her.

How long have you two been broken up? It’s his job and his life and I think if you try and get him fired it would seriously backfire on you (he may get aggressive) and/or you will feel regret and guilt for flushing a career which may be good for him down the drain.

The fact that you’re willing to throw away 15 years of friendship because you’re butthurt you weren’t invited to be in the wedding party is petty and is an asshole move. **Her wedding isn’t about you**, and just because she was in your wedding doesn’t mean she’s obligated to put you in hers, nor does it mean she doesn’t value your friendship. Going nuclear over it only shows that a) you’re BSC/narcissistic and b) she was right to not ask you to be there. 

You’re not obligated to go to anyone’s wedding you don’t want to, but throwing a hissy fit  and throwing away a long friendship because you didn’t get what you thought you were entitled to is an asshole move. "

If you let her make good decisions and bad and discuss the consequences of them while making it obvious that you trust and respect her ...    you end up with a pretty thoughtful human being.

abdyk8,"YTA.

You're making a conscious choice to cut off the friendship based on a person's 'lack of value' to you, and their general outlook on life at a particular moment in time.

You made friends initially because you must have enjoyed their companionship in the past. I don't think it was necessary to 'be honest' with them at all and would be a hurtful experience for them to have a friend come up one day and say that they are ""not useful"".

It's okay to step away for you to take a moment, step back from the friendship for a bit if its having a negative impact on your state of mind. It's also okay if friendships drift away over time. What's not okay is the method in which you architected the end of your friendship with them, and hence YTA."

There is no way you are asshole for saying No to sex. That's totally cool.

If you wanted to chill then you could have told him and it is very clear from your post that the guy was surprised to know this. 

YTA for misleading him, taking him away from his frienda on a New Year party to your home where you wanted to watch YouTube?"

abiar4,NTA and you're completely correct to be concern that he's going to cheat on you during the trip.

abieoq,NTA he obviously doesn't care about his wife or her family enough considering you make it clear that they adore him.

4 days before we moved cross country our gate was mysteriously left open and Sammy went missing never to be seen again.

I don’t (as a meat eater) necessarily *agree* with your choice, but it’s definitely *your* choice - not hers.  You’ve obviously ensured your daughter is getting a healthy and balanced diet and that’s all that matters. 


But I think bringing it up with her would be counterproductive. You’d just be validating that she’s achieved the desired effect of imposing her beliefs and upsetting you. 

I’m guessing your daughter will now be triple-checking anything she’s given there and that will be far more powerful

abmuh1,"YTA. Not because you chose not to be friends with her for her love of K-pop, but because you sound incredibly judgemental and preachy. I suspect I'd block you too.

>When I was 15 or 16 he knew my actual age then and asked to see my boobs. He was about 19-20 years old then. Flash forward to now, my boyfriend keeps throwing this in my face when I question an action of his.

>This woman from my area messaged him a selfie with a very very low cut top on and began telling him about her breasts and informed him that she's recently had a surgery on them. This woman was a complete stranger and out of the blue sends him a questionable picture and starts telling him about her boobs. I tell him that I don't like this conversation and that I think he should stop talking to her and he says goodnight. The next day I find out he added her on Snapchat. 

if your boyfriend is exchanging nudes or receiving nudes from another woman, most people would consider that cheating. the fact that you had a creepy internet friend when you were 15 has no bearing on this situation whatsoever. Why are you still with a guy that treats you like this?

EDIT: oh wait you still talk with the creepy internet friend? hmm. I may need to change my judgement. Has your BF always disliked the fact that you're still in contact?

abnedo,"ESH. I'm assuming you didn't tell her that you were coming over, which isn't very polite. On top of that, you suck for accusing her of cheating immediately. I don't think you're a bad person and it's admirable that you were so concerned, but I don't think you went about it in the best way. She's also being immature about this. She probably feels like her space was compromised, but if she cared about this relationship she should've heard you out and found forgiveness. "

abnezc,"NTA, you have no obligation to your friend’s family and it’s okay to cut people off who take advantage of your generosity (financial or emotional).

abnjco,"NTA

They're breaking the rules and it's negatively impacting your comfort. "
abnjv3,"YTA for not specifying what you want. No one can read minds, and playing games isn’t cute and doesn’t benefit your relationship in any way.

Let this be a learning tool and next time, ask for what you want."
abntto,"YTA. Relationships are work. It isn’t always easy to be faithful or committed, but in a long term relationship. You have to put in the work to keep the relationship strong. 

You say you never thought you’d be tempted to cheat, that you’d always want your fiancé the most, but that’s not reality. It’s normal to find people besides your fiancé attractive, and to get crushes, but if you can’t squelch a crush for the health of your relationship, you’re never going to be able to commit to something like a marriage. 

When you started to get a crush on your coworker, you *should have* created distance from him, and you *should have* made an effort to strengthen your connection to your fiancé. 

Instead of being honest with your fiancé - that you had a work crush, that you were feeling detached from your relationship, that you were getting cold feet - you told him not to worry about your work friend, and that your relationship was fine... right until you left him. *Thats* asshole behavior. 

You don’t get a cookie for “not cheating” when you *did* cheat emotionally (putting your desire for closeness with your coworker over your fiancé), and then left your fiancé for the other man. "

abqj9d,"NTA. Every state has different laws about this. You should check what laws apply to your state, county, and city. But even in judge Judy, paying three months after moving out is sufficient. They broke the lease terms first, engaged in illegal activities that could have negatively affected your future, and created a hostile environment to live in. Additionally, they are blocking every attempt to find a replacement, and are profiting off of it at this point. Do not feel bad for even one second for hiring a lawyer.

Raising kids is a lot. I dont think anyone who hasnt done it can even begin to understand (i dont understand). Right now you want her to do work that currently requiers two people (a cleaner and a nanny) at the same time, and then do all the chores on top of that.

Edit: lots of comments from people sharing their stories. Some people say it was easy to be the home parent, some say it was exhausting. Some people keep a naturally clean house and some kids could destroy a house with one runny nose. The only cohesive thought is that it was rewarding. To get to raise your kids directly the way you want. 

OP you have take your own journey with your wife. Dont compete and compare your experience to others. Give each step an honest try and see what works.

Also NAH.  i know at first blush it almost always seems to the working parent they will be doing more work. At 80hrs a week it very well could be, but Idk if that will always be true. In 4 months you might be back down in hours. In a few years when the kids are older she could go back to the work force. It will be your journey so make a team plan with your wife, without judgements. "
abv7nz,"YTA. Your mother and sister's unreasonable judgment of her (everything they complain about is ridiculous and bitchy, not just the gift-giving) and the failure of the rest of you to stop them in their tracks when they start that nonsense is the issue here. You think the girlfriend is unaware of all this. Either someone has told her, or she can pick up on the condescension. It would give me anxiety. So of course she can go out with friends or go to her job without being anxious- people aren't actively judging for being a smoker or having sex with people she is in exclusive relationships with FFS. Being around your family is a whole other, stressful thing. She shows up to holidays DESPITE her anxiety because she knows how important this is. Not to get presents. But at holiday gatherings she can lean on her BF most of the time for support. As a best man, he will not have much time for her, leaving her to associate with people she doesn't know at all and people who actively have contempt for her. Her decision it totally understandable."
abv830,"NTA. Wtf, he needed his delusions checked"
abvcws,"YTA. While I can appreciate that you were being disturbed there were so many better ways you could have gone about this. You had so many more options than this family did.

You could have moved table. Hell, you could have moved restaurant if you really wanted to. Quite easily. Do you have any idea the amount of planning and drama that goes into trying to have any kind of outing with a special needs child? 

Take your annoyance at that situation and imagine living it, day in day out relentlessly with NO BREAK EVER. These parents don’t have the option to move away from their kid. Ever. They don’t have the option to walk away. They sometimes can’t fucking deal with it because it never ends. 

Your title is misleading. You didn’t just request to be seated away from them, you were a massive fucking jerk to them and probably resulted in ruining some rare special occasion and having one or both of these parents crying into their pillow hating their fucking life because they can’t just have one night out without an incident.

People with special needs kids do not get to go out often, purely because people like you can’t accommodate them because they are so wrapped up in their own privilege. Try learning some compassion. 

Edit 1: Thank you for the silver and gold!

Edit 2: I won’t be responding to anyone else as, unlike OP, I actually didn’t ask anyone if they think I’m an asshole. "
abve1t,"NTA.

You invited one person over with permission, and she took advantage of that and invited two more. They show up, are rowdy and disrespectful of the host's property, and then get mad at you for telling them they have to leave?

Re-evaluate who your friends are, and explain why you did what you did to Jess. If she doesn't understand it's inappropriate to invite guests to a party you weren't originally invited to, then she's got some growing up to do."
abvilk,"NTA

They asked you for a favour, and you declined. Doesn't make them assholes for trying, and it doesn't make you an asshole for saying no.

The only asshole here is your friend."
abvrih,"NTA. Its *your* wedding; you're allowed to invite whoever you damn well please. It doesnt matter what your aunt does or tries to do - ask whoever the fuck you want to be a bridesmaid. If she convinces them not to be a bridesmaid or even not to attend, that's on them and isn't something you can worry about or control. 

Also, just enjoy the process. He proposed yesterday and you're already worrying about what your aunt might do months from now. You're giving her too much brain space and power. You got engaged and you're (presumably) in Aruba with a man you love, have fun and stop sweating the hypothetical small stuff. Get tipsy on a beach and show strangers your ring or something :)

Also, congratulations! That might be the best way to start a new year ever. "
abvyz8,NTA.  This person has no respect for your plans and was waiting to see if they had a better offer.  You don’t do that kind of waiting game unless you are seeing how other plans pan out.... 
abw2or,"NTA, at all. He seems to need some serious talk, and it doesn't have to come from you, but maybe confronting him and trying to make him understand your point of view might do good for YOU. You might be in the need to get some stuff out of your chest. Now, it doesn't mean you need to mommy up on him. If you don't feel comfortable/up to talking to him, you don't need to. And you don't need to get along with him either, but you do need to work your anger out, because it seems to be taking a toll on you. Doesn't mean you need to forgive him and doesn't mean you need to sit him up and have a serious conversation (which could actually be a good idea), you just need to vent to someone - maybe a therapist of some sort, which you might already have due to the mental illnesses you previously talked about... but all in all, NTA. He needs parenting."
abw7hz,"NTA for being upset, as long as you're quietly upset about it and don't take it out on her. "
abwfzl,NTA they need to get their shit together. You’ve done enough by visiting twice and making multiple calls. Literally all you could do
abwldo,"NAH

He’s right. Wanting to masturbate is completely different from wanting to have sex. I have a relatively low sex drive but often I just wanna bang one out. You guys have different sex drives, neither of you are wrong here, just don’t push him to do something he doesn’t want to "
abws76,"NTA.  While you knew you were going to kiss him at midnight and maybe could have chosen a lipstick that would last through it, he's being a complete child about it.  He shouldn't have tried to ditch you over it.  It sounds like he wasn't having a good time and the entire night just felt like a bust for him, but he's still not reacting well.  Given the underlying intimacy issues, lipstick seems like a flimsy excuse to him though it's valid to you and other lipstick enthusiasts."
abx5he,"NYWBTA. You make your bridal party up of the important people in your life. Little tip, pick people you think will continue to be big parts in your life, not people who have been but are already slipping away"
abx6xs,NTA she sounds like a bitch but just don’t get involved or talk to your roommate about it because it could start problems between you and your friend. She’s not worth ending a friendship over 
abx86n,"I'ma going to say NTA, especially when he treats your mom in the same manner as he does you. Which is not acceptable"
abxf0u,"NTA. He's painting you as the bad guy, he can hardly complain when you then feel unwelcome because of it. "
abxtr3,"NTA. You saved him hundreds of dollars, it takes some real nerve to complain about getting hooked up for $75 split between him and his girlfriend when he would be paying $400 without you hooking him up."
abxwkv,"ESH

You made a request (it was a pretty big one too), but that doesn't make you the asshole. What crosses you over is the fact that you didn't let it go.

As for your ""SO"", she may have felt hurt or insulted by your request, but her actions following the request unquestionably make her an asshole."
abxxt9,"NTA. Are you kidding me? Your boyfriend is the asshole here. Well obviously she is the biggest asshole but he should not allow this to happen. I can’t believe you have put up with this for 3 years. And you have a child?! Sorry but on what planet is any of this acceptable. Ok so he many not reciprocate the touchy feely stuff but that he lets himself be dragged away from you is ridiculous. Oh my god this post infuriated me! I hope everything can be sorted out OP, if I were you I’d have snapped a long time ago. "
abyddz,NTA. Putting pictures of your kid online actually isn't fair to *them.* They should get to decide for themselves when they're a bit older how much of their lives they would like to exist online (aka forever.)
abyjfv,"YTA for not letting the server know about the error then having the audacity to be salty that you paid less than you would have initially.  You're busy complaining over €1,67.  Think about that.  You're whining about €1,67."
abym6i,"NAH. You need what you need out of a relationship. At the same time, you can't really know what someone else is going through and they might not be the asshole for retreating if things are going badly for them (I know I've been in that situation, where the mere thought of going out and being social is overwhelming), certainly I don't think its something they owe anyone an apology for. As hard as it might be, try to understand that what they're going through and how they react isn't about you, nor is it a reflection on you. I would just take the friendship/relationship as it comes, with no grand expectations. I certainly wouldn't confront them or demand an explanation/apology for their time away. That'll be the quickest way to drive them away from you permanently."
abyn9r,"NTA for suggesting this. Or, you could just suggest that your wife pay a set amount that comes from her “fun money” as a way to not complicate things. 

All this being said, I don’t really think she should feel obligated to pay her parents back. This might be something they wanted to do for their child. Many parents want to pay for their kids’ education, and would probably not welcome repayment of this as it was supposed to be a gift. "
abypf4,NTA. You’re doing your best to be an accommodating partner despite your own needs. I think he needs to look at himself on this one. 
abyryw,"NTA. Being a couple doesn't mean you have to (or should) do everything together. If he can't let loose and be unfiltered when she's there, then it's probably for the best that she isn't there at these things. It's once every six months, surely she can entertain herself. Alternatively, she could make an effort to join in without having it cater specifically to her. "
abys6k,"YTA

It’s ok to be annoyed about what it’s like being with him  because he’s upset all the time but the answer should be helping him find a solution, not condemning him to a life of misery because you like his paycheck. You wrote a whole paragraph about how miserable he is and literally wrote nothing about feeling bad for him. "
abywh2,"ESH. She’s clearly worse bc that’s super rude, but you should’ve just said how what she did made you feel and left out the command to apologize. That set it up where even if she did, it wouldn’t feel genuine to you and she would just be listening to you like a child. You want her to apologize bc she’s sorry. "
abyygl,"Oh man, YTA

So like, you totally know this is being used to hurt your ex, like a real stab directly into her insecurities. Or, rather, her insecurities' back. And, eyes completely open to the situation, you did it anyways because getting your dick wet is more important than someone else's emotional health. Because you KNOW this will hurt her, and you just don't care. Even if you were doing this to a random person, it'd still be a pretty asshole move.

(Your ex's friend sounds like a cunt, too. Hope you bagged it, because I bet she's the type to tell you she's on the pill even though she ""forgot to take it that day."""
abyywd,"ESH - Grow up. She shouldn’t have hidden your cigs (I smoke and understand how shitty it feels to need a cigarette and not have access to one), but there was no reason to stoop to her level. Honestly, I don’t even think the hiding her phone makes YTA, but engaging in the petty name calling afterwards. If your smoking habit makes you mean to your pregnant girlfriend, it might be time to rethink feeding that habit. "
abyzzm,"YTA, many times over. 

1) it's your fault for not clarifying things, and for thinking that you could get the service for free just because you thought ""she would enjoy having extra company over the holidays"" like you were the ones doing *her* the favor, lol. 

2) your husband is ""debt riddled"" on his way to a very lucrative career. the poverty card don't work on this one. the two of you sound like you need some perspective. 

3) this was the best part: saying you'd throw her $70, ie what you *think* she should be paid [for 5 days of sitting, lol], if she had only ~~begged you a bit more nicely~~ asked to be compensated in a different way. 

enjoy your trip towards upper-middle middle class snottiness, you sound like you're well on the path. "
abzfug,NTA. I’m assuming she asked you to move in with her since she’s the only one on the lease? Then you’re under no obligation to remain there and help her pay the rent and utilities on her place since she broke up with you. 
abzgdw,"YTA. Full stop

Also, if all that's keeping him from going back with his ex is talking to her or seeing her then what you have with him isn't real"
abzpzk,"NTA.

You need instruction turning insults around.

You're not ""used to"" a hard bed, you like it compared to the toddler beds they sleep in.

Or...if you are not ""quick"" try something like ""that's nice dear"".

As for toilet paper...""you ladies are so full of shit, I'm surprised you don't have a standing ordér on this stuff"".

No matter what....screw them."
abzqwn,"YTA, for not offering to them also if you know they smoke and everyone is cool with smoking. 

They might not have tried from a vape and would like to. Massive bonding session you're missing out on.

Edit: OP is underage, so they absolutely should consult if they are ok with it at the very least. If they are smokers this conversation should be a much easier one, again, you may be surprised at the bonding session you could have and they will advise you how to use safely also. "
ac05af,"YTA- it’s YOUR responsibility to protect against this as well. If you don’t want a baby wear a condom, even if she’s on birth control. Neither are 100% effective. You felt tricked because she’s old enough to know the risks? That it’s “not your fault she didn’t handle contraception properly” So are you. Stop blaming other people for your inability to protect yourself. Congrats on the baby- adoption is a great option if neither of you want to keep it. 

EDIT- id like to add that you’re the asshole for putting all the responsibility on her, and saying it’s not your fault she got pregnant. Not an asshole for not wanting to raise a kid. "
ac0eda,"YTA, not ok to share other peoples personal information without permission. Maybe I didnt want people to know."
ac0gq9,"NTA - it’s hard to get in between friends like that. Not only that, you encouraged Miranda to come clean with Dane. It’s pretty brave to call your friends on their shit. 

Dane is very upset and hurting right now, and it’s likely he’s lashing out. I’d give him a bit to cool off and approach him in a week or so.

“Listen buddy, I found out; and I talked to her and told her she had to come clean. I have always been on your side. I’m sorry you’re hurt.”

As for Miranda... you wanna be friends with someone like that? Something to think about. "
ac0hem,"NTA

In my opinion, you will not be the asshole. I think the only scenario where you would be the asshole is if you very aggressively cut her off. If she is already having issues with people ganging up on her, I think the most ethical way to do this is to go back to your happy life out of state and avoid contact. Limited contact and then slowly remove yourself. You don't owe her anything, I think, and she kind of sounds like a bad friend...."
ac0n9u,NTA if he didn't mention interest before. He's definitely being a dick by altering the deal after the fact. Give him his $10 back but he isn't entitled to more than that. 
ac0nbm,"NTA - if you're an adult, you can move where you like.

I wouldn't expect much help from those who are telling you that though, so I'd make sure you're secure on finances first. You don't want to be trapped with nothing and no support.

Good luck :)"
ac0q63,"You realize Michael probably hit it, right?"
ac0qhi,NTA. Your gf is a child. 
ac0ru8,"NTA however I would suggest being more firm in the future. When I may have a possible work commitment and I'm making plans, I treat it as a solid ""I will be working"" until I know otherwise. This keeps from making others mad when plans change. I get your boyfriend was overreacting about all of this but I feel he would have gotten over it easier if you stayed from the very begining ""I'll probably be working, find some other means"""
ac10um,NTA. You treated the situation correctly; You shouldn't beat yourself up for finding out he had Autism later.
ac1153,"NTA!!! I would be so mad if I were you. She accepted care of your cat, then pawned it off to a “child” without even telling you. Then lied by omission. I would be LIVID. 

Shame on your mom. Definitely would never leave poor Menow with her again. "
ac11tm,YTA - of course you're the asshole. Leave this man alone. He loves his son and nothing you described is out of the ordinary for affectionate families. 
ac17sb,NTA. I usually tip $2 for a take out order. It depends on the restaurant. I worked in a few through college. It's an inconvenience to leave the floor and your tables to organize and cash out an order but I never expected a tip. It was always nice if someone tipped but I don't know any waiters that get upset when they leave nothing. 
ac1ire,"I relate so hard to this. My parents pull this shit all the time. 

Did you handle this situation correctly? No, you were sassy and escalated things when you shouldn’t have. However, your parents are in the wrong too. I’m not going to say ESH, because I’m more on your side here honestly. But, be more careful with how you talk to them from now on. 

Maybe do a little self reflection as well. Can you be a downer sometimes? Are you a downer around your parents and not your friends because you put on a different face for them? Do your parents just bring out the worst in you? Maybe put yourself in their shoes and think about why they might say that. See if there’s any truth to it. But ultimately, if you are happy with yourself, that’s all that matters. "

ac2qam,[removed]
ac2rsv,"NTA some people like to play the victim and it’s not your job (or anyone’s) to validate them especially when they seem insincere. 

And I know it must be annoying seeing your sister bend over backwards for him, but that’s emotional labor she’s choosing to undergo and she has to choose to stop on her own. Because if you belittle his pity parties when she sees them as real issues that he’s going through, you will look like the asshole to her. "

ac36yv,"YTA.  And an idiot.  Seriously, saying shit like this will not only make any woman you are with instantly dislike you, it can get you *banned* from a gym.  Your friend was being a gem by cluing you in. 

There's so many levels of wrong with what you said, I'll break it down a bit.  

1) You don't know these women, so your first thought is to insult not just them, but their entire gender, implying that your gender is superior.  Do you normally introduce yourself to strange men by insulting them?  Probably not.  Because you respect them.  You insulted these women because you *don't* respect them.  And it's pretty clear that you don't because you have zero respect for their behavior.

2) You have no obligation to help them out, but it's a real dick move to make fun of someone for wanting help.

3) These women and your friend were enjoying each other's company.  You were not invited into the conversation.  But you try to shift their attention to you, not by doing anything helpful or interesting, by acting like a dork.  That's embarrassing and annoying for everyone, including the random people working out around you.

Your friend is correct, you don't know how to talk to people."
ac3jm8,Nope I don't agree. (Woman here who has been pregnant 3 times). This woman has way too many clothes. When your SO feels impacted by you clothes it's time to take stock and re-evaluate what is important. He has already given her more than her fair share of storage space for her clothes.
ac3mfd,"WAS A CASHIER. 

YES YOURE AN ASSHOLE AND WE ALL HATE YOU. "
ac3nta,"NAH really. I mean, if he just wants sex when he's ill, then that's pretty common. Power of bones. But if he's constantly berating you for it like it's owed to him, 
its an asshole move"
ac3rcc,NTA.  I think it would help if you saw a therapist about this and talk to the people over at r/legaladvice.   She did a number on you.
ac3u3k,NTA.  Tell her you can't make it and wish her a happy birthday (because you don't want to be like her in that regard).

ac4kx7,"NAH
You acted with the information given.
He said what he probably thought was the truth. 
His emotions surprised him. Being mad at you is a bit silly since he told you to go for it.

It's OK he feels weird about it.
It's OK if you feel weirded out by his reaction.

The trick now is to maybe apologise not so much for what you did, but for how he feels and your actions bringing that on. Explain how important his friendship is and that you value him.

And hope you can get past the bump."
ac4l0g,"ESH: not just you but your sister. At least now you're realizing that it was wrong and you need to apologize, but your sister still isn't acknowledging how shitty that was. One thing is two teenage siblings sitting on each other and joking like that, another is two adults doing it to a 13 year old girl. 

Also, she's not being a 'drama queen', she's being an insecure 13 year old. People are sensitive at that age, and being made fun of for a blackhead is much more dramatic than it is as an adult. 

Do your part: apologize to her and tell her you've realized that was wrong. "

ac4zea,"NTA! OMFG. \*I\* was ready to murder him and then you told us about the post-breakup two weeks. After Christmas I'd be ready to kill your SO as well as his friend! This is so incredibly over the line of OK I don't know how you can stand it. His behaviour is obnoxious and completely inexcusable - from what you've described he's dirty, rude, inconsiderate, demanding, and boorish... and he's there for (often) \*2 nights a week\* for the last \*2 years\*. Is your husband INSANE to allow this? Just the days that you've described here is \*220 nights\* in the last two years. **That is 30% of your LIVES over the last two years.**

&#x200B;

If you were ok with it it would be incredibly weird, but fine.... but you're not. You're not happy, and your husband is prioritising the company this demanding, gross, creeper over his wife's happiness.

NTA. You guys do you. Thanks for the laugh.

EDIT: For real, I just can’t get this out of my head. I’ve been thinking about it all day. So your wife won’t fuck you, so you just stand up and start fuckin’ whackin’ it? Like, do you stare her in the eyes? Do you put on like a sad face? Just stone cold? I need more details on this. OP don’t do this to me man this is comedy gold. You need to talk to that person and get more information. Is it a sad wank? And angry wank? Like what even man... I can’t let this one down. Why? How? I need to know more. Commence Operation Angry Wanker.

Work events come and go but you’re talking about not seeing someone you regard as one of your closest friends for AT LEAST 3 years (maybe more). Feel like the gravity of that is not really sinking in with you.

ac6560,"NTA. It's affecting your sleep. I'd be specific about what the problem is, so they can know exactly what it is that's causing the problem.

I'm not sure it's you, but in case it is, I wanted to see if it would be possible to avoid this sound late at night.* or something like that. "
ac67ur,"ESH, I think. 

Your mom knows she’s obese. I get you’re probably coming from a place of concern, but she knows, and being told what she already knows doesn’t help her. She sucks (as do you) for contributing to a screaming match, and so does your dad. He also sucks for throwing things at you.

MASSIVE RED FLAGS.   She is **just jealous**, and this won't stop.  If she can't distinguish between a dog and herself, how will she deal with a female coworker?  An old friend?

She HIT your Dog?  [SHE HIT YOUR DOG?](https://media1.tenor.com/images/9002e9f65548c7bc48898da136f6b6b3/tenor.gif)  Are you kidding me?  Not just once, where you may have informed her you don't do that, but twice?  TWICE?  
  
She is literally committing physical violence against something you love, after being told to stop, out of her jealousy.  
  
She is an utterly rancid, festering disease-ridden asshole and you ABSOLUTELY owe it to Moose to defend him against this witch.  If you don't, you are subjecting him to violence - and he will not defend himself from her, out of devotion to you.

You don't have the right to have work performed and bill the landlord for it. They have their own employees and their own system for this and you'll be, best case, shit out of luck with your bill. Worst case, sued for damages to the unit and evicted.

Not displeasure with the rest of the attendees, your other friends who had a party canceled on them, but to basically ""teach your friend a lesson"".  Kinda flighty and unreliable behavior.  \*\*If any of your friends turned down other plans because of your party, then you were an asshole to them.\*\*    
    
Your friend was honest with you about why they wanted to invite the roommate.   Things may have soured with you but this person is still friendly.  So they are open and honest with you about why they want the roommate to attend, and your reaction is to throw a fit like a toddler.  \*\*""IF YOU DON""T CHOOSE TIME WITH ME OVER YOUR ROOMMATE,  THEN NO ONE WILL PARTY!!!""\*\*.  How immature.

I get your reasoning. It makes sense, but it doesn't take into account how that fact would impact your GF's feelings. You're only considering your own feelings. 

Would making Uncle leave please your GF at all? Will she feel like she's disrespecting her mother? Will it feel like kicking out a father figure? At the end of the day, it sounds like you are asking her to handle the emotional labor of something that would only please you, that she doesn't even think should be done.

After Uncle is gone, other things will stress you out. That's just life. Will you stick your GF with the emotional labor then, too?"

 Geez man, you're being thick. Maybe that's why she got upset at the thought of never being taken out for dinner again.

It seems that now, she's gotten her hopes of you moving in way up, and you've just revealed that you're not planning on it, so her hopes have crashed. I still think she overreacted, but I can understand where she is coming from. The best solution is to talk to her about, say you're sorry for not expressing your concern earlier, but try to lay out exactly why you're not ready to move out yet. Try to frame it as ""It's not that I don't want to live in your place, it's more that I'm not ready to leave this place"" so she takes it more gently."

People thank you for lots of reasons. Maybe their dad served, or their brother. Or their husband. Maybe they never got the chance to square accounts with someone. Speaking to you is their chance for them to try to relieve some of their hurt, to convey some of their respect and appreciation.

You say ""You're welcome"". Shake their hand. Look into their eyes. It's something that has to be done, because there are friends of ours who can't get those messages of thanks, of pride, of regret, of loss. 

You accept their thanks for the ones who can't, and for their own peace of mind."
acldt8,"NTA, you picked him out of mugshot because he’s a career criminal not a changed man. Don’t cave into that utopian bullshit. "

She probably got her hopes up that a shitty and uncomfortable weekend was going to be less shitty, and now she's by herself.

I would also make sure you keep up communication during the event so she knows you're still thinking of her. "

acml4b,"NTA, my entire reasoning for this is b/c when you help someone move they (ideally) give you pizza and beer as compensation for your time. Even though they are paying you in pizza and beer they are still paying less than if they were to hire a professional. You offered your time as long as you got compensation, then you offered to lend your car for a fraction of the cost it would have cost them to rent one. They just didn't want to pay you."
acmnb6,"NTA.... I would say your response could have been put a different way though.  Being honest is hard, I know!  But...I think going into the details of making children's clothes, and how disposable you believe them to be, might have been too far.   I also sew, and I get your point 100%. I wouldn't have agreed to make the dress either, but I think I'd have told her you don't have the time and let it be at that. If she kept pushing just let her know you don't enjoy making children's clothes (they are harder!).  Both are true without passing judgement in any way. Just my thoughts. "

>Basically I just need to know if I’m the asshole for sending food I don’t like but was technically prepared right back and expecting not to be charged for said dish. 

To put it another way you want to try dishes for free. That's what reviews are for. This is a waste of food. If you're allergic to an ingredient that's a whole other thing but nah, they made it the way they always make it, and you just didn't like it. 

It's like if you booked a hotel, took a plane to another country, and then asked for refunds when you realized you actually hate travelling but were ""catfished"" by all the brochures. You're making restaurants pay for your inability to order stuff you like.

You're paying to have a food item prepared for you. Whether you enjoy it or not isn't the promise.

That said, it's just good business for them to take it back because restaurants that aren't surviving off tourists survive off repeat business and they're basically willing to pay you to have you find something you wanna keep trying. (Or convince other people to do that.)"
acr9lp,"Yes, you did. You’re his father.

Others might disagree and maybe I'm a little selfish as well, but it doesn't matter. You married a single man but you're now having to share him with 2 other women. Family or not, you didn't sign up to be a third wife.

Talk to your husband! Have a serious discussion about his relationship with his family and how you feel. I'm not sure if you want your own kids, but you both need to discuss and start planning. 

Not saying abandon his family in any way shape or form. But there has to be some boundaries, unless you want to continue with the sisterwives type relationship. 

"
acrreu,"I'd say NAH, but only because you don't 'throw a hissy fit'. Otherwise, you'd be close to being the asshole.

It's normal to feel a need for intimacy. And not getting it makes you feel unwanted, which sucks. Nobody wants to feel that way.

However, she has past traumas. You know this. And you don't get to decide how and when she heals from it. I know that you feel unwanted but that's not why she rejects you. It's because of her needs. And those needs are at least just as important as yours.

The key is communication. My only worry is that if you tell her that you need intimacy and that long stretches without it make you feel unwanted and frustrated, she'll feel like the bad guy when she isn't. And she'll put herself into a situation she's uncomfortable with just to appease you. I get the feeling that, because you use words like 'intimacy', that it's not just about having sex, but wanting her to want you. Not wanting her to just put out to keep you happy even if it causes her stress or discomfort. Behind the frustration, you seem to care about her happiness.

There's the possibility that you just can't be together any more. You need something that she's not able to give you and it's beginning to cause resentment. That's a very bad sign and it might be healthier if you instead looked for someone who could give you what you need, as well as letting her find someone more accomodating for her need to deal with her trauma on her own time."

I don't think you're wrong for not wanting to sit down on old dog drool. But your girlfriend probably doesn't understand what the big deal is she is so used to it. She lives there so she is desensitized to the smell.

actxro,"> He asked you what you wanted him to do to be nice, and when that question is posed between adults the answer should always be “whatever makes you happy.”

Honestly, have you ever had a conversation like that where someone said ""whatever makes you happy"" and it sounded genuine? We both knew there was no way to make everyone happy, so I told him how I felt about the whole thing and that it was ultimately his choice. He seemed very understanding. There was no argument there, just a friendly conversation. The problems only started when his girlfriend got angry and gave him an ultimatum.

> You talk about what a hard year you have had, have you thought about how his year has been and how scary it would be to be on your own after years of marriage?

Yes, I have. I was there, I spent months trying to comfort him and help wherever I could. I was genuinely happy when he found someone new. That's not the point. It's not like I expect him to break up with his girlfriend and stay at home 24/7, I just don't want to be treated like his personal cleaner/dogsitter. He says he doesn't have time to help with the household, which is of course true because he works full time and fucks off every Friday at noon and doesn't come back until Sunday evening. Again, I don't want him to stay at home all the time, I just wish he'd maybe do some stuff around the house on Friday afternoons once in a while and drive to his gf on Saturday morning or something like that, instead of expecting me to make time between work and university. This has been going on for months and I'm desperate for a break."
acu2dy,"NTA

I don't think that the friend's gender reveal has anything to do with this though.  

It's bad on its own that your ""best friend"" told you for four months she was going, and has no explanation for why she changed her mind.  

This woman either doesn't see you as a good friend, or she's just a very selfish and inconsiderate person.  Most likely both.

>She changed her mind two days before saying she couldn’t miss her dads birthday, which was the very next day. I said ok, didn’t mind, didn’t put another thought into it because I understood this could happen as she does not like to travel.

This isn't a normal reaction to what your friend did.  Are you just very used to her walking all over you?  

>had their airfare covered so it was at no cost to them.

So she knowingly wasted the money you spent on her airfare? 

>she only had to pay for the $30 dress she bought and was planning on returning anyway, as well as the $80 hotel she was splitting (so $40 from her pocket) with another friend.

So she's either cheap or struggling financially and you're wealthy enough to buy plane tickets for 15 people?

This is the sort of thing that you try to learn from as you pick up the pieces.  

EDIT: Just reread the title.  You say ""Assert your worth and axieties to my ex"".  If you don't drop this relationship and confront her to set her straight then yes, you are an extreme asshole.  She doesn't want to be around her.  Respect that even if you don't understand it.  Attempting to force respect will have the opposite effect.

The car seat is in her car. Which means it's at work with her. 

I get that she should have thought ahead and taken it out before going to work so that you'd have it if you needed it, but this isn't the time to berate her about it. 

She's exhausted, she's trying to get home, and there's nothing she can do about it at this point to fix her mistake. Complaining to her is not helpful.

When she realized what happened she offered to call her mom instead. She didn't insist you drive with the baby on your lap. She wasn't being unreasonable. And her waiting to text you back doesn't really matter because she did end up texting you back. There's no info to say she was giving the silent treatment or being spiteful.

TL;DR have the conversation about the car seat once she's home, not when she's stranded and already frustrated and can't do anything about it."

acwfxw,NTA it’s important to do things individually in a relationship and have your own interests but it would have been polite to tell you if it conflicted with plans you already made together or at least apologise if she genuinely forgot. Also your interests/needs are just as important as hers even if she considers them inferior. I feel like an honest discussion about each others needs (where you both agree not to get angry) might help here. Also you could sync your phone calendars to avoid accidentally double booking yourselves. We do ours as we both have iPhones but I think there’s apps for it if you have different phone brands.

You're not an asshole for not taking care of her, but it sounds like you weren't particularly worried about her either. This isn't about brownie points or looking good in her eyes-- it's about your girlfriend feeling lonely and wanting to be cared for.

To me, it seems that you're not asking if you're an asshole for prioritizing your own needs, but for not living up to expectations that you feel are unfair and selfish. So in short? Yeah, you're an inconsiderate asshole.

That said, I feel that your girlfriend overreacted as well. Not to the point of this being ESH, but enough to make me pause and think she could have considered your situation as well. I'd suggest talking this over with her once she feels better."

She destroyed trust and probably did awful things to damage your relationship.

You can’t be on the fence. You need to choose to trust her going forward, or leave. Choosing the middle route and telling/expressing mistrust will either be the death blow to the relationship, or will make her recovery harder.

Don’t get me wrong, you’re in the right. But recovery is a tightrope walk. Indirectly telling her you mistrust her, and monitoring her is going to wreck her. She may relapse, she may not.

You have to choose if you want to aid in her recovery, make it harder, or check out"
ad3672,"Ugh...I'm gonna go with NTA because you were doing what you thought was right and what our culture has been INSISTING is right for years now.  I see how you thought it was sketchy that he got you to help move her partially against her will so that he could have sex with her in a blackout state.  But if she doesn't feel she was raped, you can't decide that for her.  Some couples actually do make an assumption of ongoing consent.  Just because it's gray doesn't mean it's not their right.  You can't live K's life for her and with no proof of anything you can't do things like tell other girls about T.  But I can't call you the bad guy for talking about consent in general with him or anyone else, or for being vigilant.  Just don't make outright accusations so hastily again."

But this is an actual crime, and from what you're saying, she's also levying actual threats at you.  Whether she can or will back them up is irrelevant.

ad7fwi,"NTA- feral cats can cause alot of issues for wildlife and people. They can cause mass extinction of birds, rabbits, squirrels and other native wildlife causing ecological disruption. These cats aren't healthy either, they spread lice, rabies, worms and other parasites. It's very common for feral cats to fight each other so most of them have issues with infection and don't heal or suffer other kinds of painful death. It's inhumane to encourage unhealthy large populations of cats just because some people like to see them around. 

If people want to have cats they can do it on their own property, keep them healthy and happy just like you are expected to with your dog. 

All of that said, I think it's incredibly tragic how some of these large cat populations are handled. They don't deserve to be put down because of one cat lady's ignorance. Maybe try to get in touch with a feral cat sanctuary to see if they can capture them live, neuter, and give vaccines to these cats and let them live out the rest of there lives in a designated area where they aren't harming other wildlife.

ad7yqo,"NTA - geez this sounds like the epitome of the high maintenance friend nightmare. You absolutely need to take care of you before you can help anyone else, and you’re absolutely right that you’re not her doctor, husband, doula, paid help..etc. You’ve made no commitments to her over and above being her friend, and there is no requirement for you to do anything for her. Anything you do is done thanks to your goodwill, and I can completely understand how this is now wearing pretty thin!
If this specific example was one of only a handful of times she’d been like this, I’d be inclined to consider whether there’s something deeper going on (is she terrified because she thinks her husband is going to leave her and she’ll be alone, for example?) but it sounds like this is just how she is, and you’re right that you just need to have a pretty frank conversation about it. I’d suggest writing down what you want to say and setting some boundaries and sticking to them. That way, if she asks something that’s just completely unreasonable, you can refer back to them as the reason, which might make it easier to say no every now and again.
This is all assuming this is a friendship you want to keep up. I’m a bit of a cynic, but it sounds like this is a pretty one sided and exhausting friendship. At some point, maybe you need to ask yourself whether it’s one worth keeping?"
ad8099,"ESH - Probably going to get hate for this but you did use his credit card without him realising.

That being said, you didn't realise and it was an honest mistake. You didn't mean any harm. Assuming you can afford it, if it were me I would pay him back and apologise, it's just $50 which isn't a huge amount. Not worth the arguments it might cause"

It’s fine to feel insecure, but treating him like a liar and an emotional cheater is unfair to him.

It’d be one thing if she was just one of his friends he didn’t associate with you, but he clearly really wants you to meet her because it’s important to him to at least try to consolidate the most important woman in his life, with a close friend who he doesn’t want to lose.

Honestly, I’ve been in your boy’s shoes, and it’s agony, knowing the person whose opinion you value more than anything, is putting a wedge between you and a close friend.

It all depends on how you go about it. If you speak to the director of the complex and come at them guns blazing, they're going to be less likely to help you. Just tell them calmly, and rationally that it's frustrating to you as a tenant to not receive packages on time. Example:

You: ""Yes, hello, can you tell me the complex's policies and guidelines for entering in packages? Because sometimes I pay for express shipping so that I can have my items that same day and will see that they've been delivered, but will often have to wait much longer to receive them. Sometimes as long as the next day after I paid for same day shipping. Am I missing something in your guidelines for packages?""

Usually when you come at them with non threatening questions, they'll be more than happy to accommodate you and no feathers will be ruffled. ONLY mention those one or two workers as a last resort if the manager asks if there's anyone in particular who doesnt get packages out quickly enough. "

With all the trauma of constant doctor visits/worrying/extreme anxiety, she probably needs therapy and the medicine(legit stuff not homeopathic mess) to truly get better on all levels. But mentally she's not ready for it yet and that's a point she has to reach on her own.

add52r,NAH. This is a really silly thing to lie to her about. Just be honest and explain the situation to her. Your girlfriend is reasonable to care about whether you got home safe.
add9ki,"NTA at all. Be safe, and protect yourself.

addpo0,"NTA. It doesn't sound to me like there's much else you could have done, and you weren't even asking that much of them. You've told them several times to respect your need for sleep, and they seem like they don't care all that much.   


You deserve better roommates."

ade7jk,"NTA

That's not the kind of conversation you have with someone DURING sex. She could have made the suggestion in a discussion with you at any time and it would have turned out better. 

It's okay to have kinks but it was definitely weird she had someone specific in mind... doesn't mean she is cheating but she seems to have a threesome or cuckold situation in mind and the fact that she already picked someone out is a bit hurtful because it means she's been thinking about doing this with him specifically not JUST as a way to expand your sex life.

Also telling you your feelings are ridiculous is just hurtful and dismissive."
adef82,"YTA. Because he cheated on you, you want to get him and his otherwise innocent family deported? That's like level 100 asshole."
adeja2,"NTA.  I thought I would feel differently from reading the title, but here we are.  If he is being hostile to you then he is trying to drive you off.  She's going to have to make a choice sooner or later, might as well be now."

You sleep when you need to. If you really need to change your sleep schedule you can use melatonin to help. However your sleep schedule isn't the problem, your boyfriend is."
adf81i,"NAH, because I think you were doing your best in the situation as you understood it, but I think you misunderstood the situation.

I don't like to armchair diagnose people, and obviously I only know your second-hand account of the situation so I can't say he's mentally ill for sure, but your friend really, really, really seems to be having some kind of psychotic episode. He says that there's a girl inside his head talking to him that he's not allowed to tell anyone about, that god is literally speaking to him, and he's suddenly developed nonsensical, grandiose, and out of character religious delusions (delusions in the literal, psychiatric sense, not in the ""all religion is delusion ha ha"" sense). Like... this is textbook onset of diseases like schizophrenia. Pot smoking in adolescence is also correlated with development of psychotic disorders btw, possibly due to people attempting to self-medicate early symptoms. 

This is all to say that you treated this like a discussion of religious differences, and got angry when he wasn't being rational. I really don't think that's the situation. I think you were having a discussion with a person experiencing hallucinations and delusions about their hallucinations and delusions, which is very obviously not going to work. If he could rationally consider his delusions, they wouldn't be delusions.

If I'm right, the best thing to do is to 1) realize he is not currently capable of thinking rationally about this 2) accept that what he's experiencing is real to him even if it is only in his head and 3) try to gently encourage him, or have your family encourage him, to seek help. Number 3 will be extremely difficult if not impossible because he believes his delusions and hallucinations are true experiences (which is the hallmark of psychosis), so definitely don't feel like you're in any way responsible for making him seek help. You can't make him do anything. Just if he mentions being bothered by any of this, such as the voices in his head, maybe gently encourage him to see if a doctor could help with this.

I mean, I could be completely wrong about all this. It just really screams psychotic break to me."
adfbh6,"YTA this reads as ""waaaah I'm rich and haven't ever faced consequences, waaaah"""

Your friend needs to learn some common decency. Also your GF needs to understand the gravity of the situation. That guy may be your friend, but when someone is doing something very shitty, you have every right to call him out for it."
adfeqi,"As teasing goes, that's pretty mild.

I'm going with NTA.  Obviously she thinks she should be able to dish it out and never take it, but that's not how life works.  I'm glad you stop being friends with her. She was really disrespectful."
adfidq,"YTA, imo; he's not a dog or a child. Just remind him that you're serious & repeat the question. If it's that bad, consider having a better conversational partner. "
adfkho,"NTA in the slightest. You were honest and didn't lead her on. She's young, that's why she took it so hard. "
adfs7k,NTA. Of course not. It must be frustrating to watch. But be prepared for drama. Your daughter is her meal ticket and don't think your gf doesn't know  it
adfvmu,NTA. Your roommate/friend seems really insensitive given the fact that you had to deal with such a stressful and emotional experience and wouldn’t shut up about an issue obviously not as pressing. Honestly I’m sorry for you that’s so rude
adfxda,"ESH. You can do whatever you want with whoever you want but you and the friend clearly made him uncomfortable and from his perspective trust and boundaires were violated. Dave clearly has/had feelings for you and he obviously confided that in his friend. He also point blank asked you not to, which was shitty of him and 100% not his place. His friend is the real piece of shit in this situation though. In order of sucking it goes 1. Dave's friend. 2. Dave. 3. You. 

I think you're the least asshole in this situation but still a bit of one. "

That's simply not right. Talk to her about it.

My guess is she thinks she's being fair. Now, you want her to visit your kids more often. Does she know how you feel? Have you told her? Don't expect people to read your mind.

"
adgpuf,"NTA. Don't let him use you. Make clear what the agreement is, verbal or written down on your own discretion. Bad months happen, but they aren't the norm, they're the exception. Stop letting him get away with this, especially when it's clear he could be doing (a lot) more."
adgsgs,"NTA.

Looking after your friends if they've had too much to drink is extremely important; anything can happen to someone that drunk. If you're not willing to end your own enjoyment to help out, then you don't really deserve friends. 

You say you asked in a calm tone, but to be honest, if I was in your position I'd be furious. She only had to apologise and could have moved on. 

My guess is that the breakdown of her engagement has made her a bit self-destructive. She's probably feeling resentment towards those in stable relationships and is acting out. So basically, be careful! She'll snap back to normal eventually, but expect some vitriol in the short term.

adm44j,"NTA. Run like the plague. Getting a lease with your best friend is already a risky situation, I know from prior experience. Adding all this other stuff, I wouldn’t even consider it to be perfectly honest.

If you do decide not to live with her, approach the conversation as delicately as possible. It’s not your responsibility to be on her lease, but you don’t want to be brash about it."
admo4z,"NTA but this is more of a /r/relationship_advice issue.

Personally I think you aren't going to win well here. If you don't go, you will make your family upset. Always happens. 

Might I suggest you to try and take control over the whole event? I used to be the ""sit around and browse my phone"" person as a kid and even a college student, because I felt that family events were just a drag. But now, I've actually inserted myself as a primary planner for family events. Not really doing all kinds of activity-based planning, but actively creating new conversation points, cooking, etc. 

It's not easy, but it does a lot to help your self-confidence in family situations. "

The way you said you responded to him was harsh. If you wanted a good emotional friendship or whatever from this guy, you should have treated him better. 

You’re playing him and I understand why he is upset. 

"
adok6b,"NTA/NAH. You both clearly need to work on your communication skills. 


She said she *likes* it but she is never/very very rare willing to do it? I doubt it. Something is bothering her, it could be her lying that she likes it because she thinks she *has* to like it. Maybe there is some other problem (smell, hair, your behaviour when she is down there - too passive, too agressive, not expressive or vocal enough, etc). Maybe she thinks she is doing something wrong while doing it. 


Talk to her about it and don't demand and don't pressure her, you won't get blowjob that way nor will you get to the bottom of this problem."
adol5l,"NTA. When people are toxic, they're toxic. It's okay to not want to see people when you should stay focused on yourself. "
adomm2,"YTA. If you feel trapped you should set up play dates with other moms.  Join a gym that has a daycare service so you can have some time without her. I am sure him hearing of how your sister has two nannies also really rubbed him the wrong way since that's obviously not financially feasible for you. You said you have student loans which means you have a college education. Why not use that to get a part time job that would pay for a nanny while you're at work and maybe an extra hour or two after so you can have time to yourself?

adoqvk,"YTA- When something happens in a relationship that hurts trust, it takes a long time to fix it.

You should have been told when it happened. It is a dick move for everyone to keep that a secret.

adpu09,"NTA with a dash of ESH - She is definitely in the wrong for many things and it is completely fine for you to drop her as a friend, but IMO ghosting is not the right way to go about this. 

You should set up something in public (so no violence/yelling would occur) and explain to her how her behavior is affecting you and that if she won’t change you don’t want to continue to be friends with her. If she refuses or starts and argument get up and leave.

Also r/relationships is a good place to ask if you want to try and work this out with her.

I only suggest a personal confrontation because you don’t want her to be showing up at your house unannounced or worst case crashing your wedding, which could happen if you ghost her. 

Edit: More detail"
adpx4t,"YTA for not telling your wife right away

But, at this point, are you wanting to tell her for you, or for her? I think how you answer that will determine your next steps."
adpz43,"NAH - These things can be tricky.  I would have expected the same, but you didn't talk about it beforehand.  Pay the bill, and next time he wants your help or you want his, talk about money beforehand or just decline.  Its just money, its not losing a friendship over."
adq2sh,"NTA - there’s no denying this girl needs help, but with your particular challenges you may not be the one to help her. You need to be in a healthy place too. You pointed her to where she can get help and hopefully get to a place like where you’re at - recovering. "
adq84x,"NTA, your mother sounds VERY manipulative and it was wrong of her to blackmail your sister like that. However, unless your mom had proof that you had told your sister about it, your sister probably should have lied and said she didn’t know. 

But you sound pretty young. I wouldn’t be angry with your sister. She didn’t do it on purpose, your mom manipulated her. Your mother is in the wrong here. 

If you’re having problems, look into talking to a professional. Perhaps your school (if you have one?) has a counselor/resources you could use. At the very least, talk to a trusted friend. It’s not good to keep things bottled up inside. 

Hope all is well :)"

The others don't have to be involved at all, in fact, it sounds like it would be best if they weren't, but the brilliant thing about adulting is that you can have multiple separate or intermingled friend groups to do different things with.

>Boyfriend, passport deadline is coming up.  **I'm not reminding you again**, and if you don't get it taken care of I'm going without you.

The reason this makes a difference to me is that you've gotten him used to being reminded, and pulling out from that support role without telling him explicitly that's what you're doing is unnecessarily unkind."

As a roommate, he shouldn’t care. But as a friend, he has the right to be angry. He was willing to bend for you and feels like his flexibility led to him missing out.

Reaffirm that it was your mistake, invite him over often to show you like to have him around, and things should go back to normal. 

Not an asshole, as it wasn’t intentional. But a little reaffirming of the importance of your friendship will likely go a long way."

If the child was not in school yet, I would totally understand her position.

It sounds like she's gotten used to leaning on you for finances. My main opinion is that it's not fair that she doesn't want to work while you've been the sole supporter for years.

If you didn’t go bc you were afraid you wouldn’t be able to hold your tongue, thus making her stress higher, NTA. If this is the case, tell her - it might help. 

If your reason was not going was you didn’t want to be around them bc you don’t like them, YTA for not being a support system for your SO. In her eyes, you were another person she can’t count on, emotionally speaking.

Her parents are definitely assholes and the mom absolutely traded one addiction for another. 

Maybe you can compromise: you’ll make an appearance at family events if she puts her foot down and demands that they give at least a week’s notice if they want her to do any favors for them (ie. dog-duty). Be sure to include a limit on that family time bc I’m sure you don’t want to spend more than necessary in their company. 

No matter what, sincerely apologize to your SO for not being there to support her, even if you felt it was the right thing to do. Let her know you love and support her and that you both will work on how to deal w her parents’ behavior. 

Best of luck, OP. "
adyzyc,"NTA

Mostly. You get a lot of leeway here bc she not only cheated, but with a close family member. So I’m sure it wasn’t just your household that got shaken up by her disgusting behavior. But that leeway isn’t endless. Keep that in mind as you proceed. 


You need to keep it civil for your child’s sake. It sucks as a kid when your parents either don’t get along or openly war w one another. That stuff tears kids up inside. And kids pick up on it, even if you think you’re hiding it from them.

 So yeah, don’t provoke - and writing “obviously don’t care” was a way to poke at her. You could have said, “Remember our talks? You’re crossing the boundary again.” With her history, I can certainly sympathize. 

Might be time for a reminder: that you want to be civil for your child, but her actions took away any chance of friendship. That if it wasn’t for your child, you would be happy to never see or speak to her again. Blunt, but not rude. No name-calling.  Keep your child in the forefront of your mind to remind you *why* you must be civil. Feel free to think all the shitty things you want, though.

ae21b5,"ESH This sounds like a very dysfunctional family, and coming from a dysfunctional family I think I can provide some clarity.

For one, your parents are letting electronics raise their kids. A 5 year old shouldn't be using a computer for hours and she shouldn't need it to sleep. You yourself are going through computer withdrawals which is probably what escalated the situation. You already have your own computer, you should've just waited for it to be repaired.

Your parents paid for both of those computers, they get to decide what is done with them, not you. When your mother asked for it, you should've given it, even if it was ""unfair"".

This shouldve never escalated to violence. If your mother touched you first, she is way out of line and unstable. I mean, really? 

Then she drops a nuke and says you're basically dead to her. I wonder if theres more to this story? If not then wow, she has major emotional problems. 

I feel sorry for everyone involved, but you're all shit here. I would try to maybe apologize for your part, and see if shes willing to open up to you about why she acted like that and said those things? But wait until shes calm. "

ae2owo,"ESH. I generally agree with your point. While I don’t believe devices like that are recording everything, I do believe they record more than most people think. There are plenty of documented cases of this, and considering your reasons are valid, it wasn’t ok for your SO to treat your concern like a joke. That being said, there was zero need for you to insult her mother. "

Not that I'm unsympathetic, cause dude, I *get*. Single parenting is fucking *hard* and uniquely relentless. 

But your son isn't a pet. He's not a dog you can just rehome when you find out the breed is incompatible with your lifestyle. He's your son, and I'm sorry none of the other parents in your life told you this, but the moment your son entered this world your needs and wants plummeted to a far second to his. Because you are *it* to him. You are the center of his world. He hasn't ""started to form an attachment to you""--he loves you. Wildly and unconditionally. You are his rock, his world, his center. Removing that is cataclysmic to him, no matter how nice his new family is. And you want to remove him for...you time? Nope, that is not even slightly starting to begin to be a good reason for that kind of damage to another person. 

(Side point: read up on adoption statistics for kids his age. I know that babies are a hot commodity, but I'm fairly sure demand plummets as the kid get even a bit older than that). 

You need to make ""you time"" happen, though. As in, at least once a month you are hiring a babysitter for the evening/day, and you are treating yourself/doing something fun FOR YOU. Get screened for PPD (yep! it hits dads too! Little known fact, and it may be impeding with your ability to bond), and if it's possible, squeeze some time to find someone to talk to about how overwhelmed you are. Can you do baby playdates with some of the regulars you see at parks/classes/daycare? Just...find some way to buy more time for you in your week, something to look forward to.

If I a man get scolded for walking into the wrong room why not women as well? "
aeara1,NTA. Just because you have a non-exclusive relationship with someone doesn't mean that you aren't entitled to have his attention *on you* when he's with you. I think that's a perfectly reasonable request.
aeau54,NAH.  You like who you like and shouldn’t have to apologize for it.  
aeaw4t,"NTA. This is silly. “American” is the commonly-accepted demonym for people from the U.S. across many languages. Also, just because they could technically call themselves American as well (using a broader definition) doesn’t make you NOT an American, so they shouldn’t have any problem with you using the term. "
aeayce,"ESH: you're the asshole here because the statement telling her to control her emotions better. Not because it's the wrong thing to say, but because that's not what you're annoyed at her about. You're already annoyed with her about her repeatedly reminding you, and telling you that you'll be late without her. That has nothing to do with her emotional state.  

She's the asshole for taking her stress out on you.  There's no point in that, and the transference of emotional energy to you from her I'm sure it's something you'd like to do without.

When you see her on Sunday, I honestly hope you can separate those two topics from each other. I think you'll find that getting her to stop the behavior you find grating (e.g. Her being the reminder for not being late) will be much easier accomplished if you can separate the conversation away from her agrivated  mental state"
aeb1r4,"NTA - while she is with you in the mall, you have a responsibility to protect her. At least a ""can you not do that while you're with me?"" would be appropriate.

Worst case scenario, she doesn't ask you to take her to the mall anymore... Or she starts thinking that you're interested in her."
aeb1ve,NTA .  Your sister needs to go. I would so hate for my kids to pick up on this behavior being a possibility. 
aeb2lh,"Nah, if she doesn’t know anything about cats how do you expect her to make the right choice? Not every paint shop is the same and the price difference alone shouldn’t be the only thing taken into consideration. She more then likely assumes you know more then her about cars and would prefer the more experienced person make the call. That makes perfect sense to me. I’ve work in a Body Shop and trust me, you don’t want her handling this. They’ll swindle her. They won’t do that with you. 

And just because she accidentally scratched the back of the car doesn’t make her a bad driver and you have no right to be this pissed over a car. It was an accident. Move past it dude. My husband hit a pole while we were driving. I laughed at him and moved on. Shit happens. You sound really condescending. You may think you hid it well but in my experience you just thought you did. She knows. "
aeb3cr,NTA - there’s nothing a kid can do that would call for that kind of punishment. That’s child abuse. 
aeb549,NTA. Suicide threats are a common form of abuse and manipulation. You're not wrong (much less an asshole) for refusing to cave.
aeb74m,"NTA, if you offer to help and she doesn’t take the offer, that’s on her. You can’t be expected to follow her around all the time and make sure she doesn’t do anything that might injure her. She is an adult."
aeb7zk,"ESH.

You for ""testing"" her on your friend, when you obviously had feelings for her.

Her for stringing your friend along with no intention of following through, when she knew she obviously had feelings for you.

Him for talking behind your back. But hey, maybe he figured out the truth.

You can say you didn't *intend* to hurt him, but you obviously didn't think if you *would*. "
aeb8fw,NTA. At all. I hope you have an emergency get away plan in case he starts drinking again. 
aebawl,"Divorce is an exciting time full of new experiences.

So is parachuting.

While parachuting, worry about your own parachute. You have more the enough on your plate as is."
aebfa1,"NTA this is less of a message to you and more to the people with a YTA. If it weren't for the faith healing and major switching I would say dont do it, but I would rather a possible argument now, than a possible death later due to a) homelessness (no job due to theology major) or B) disease because he took em to a faith healer for cancer rather than a real doctor."
aebhai,"NTA. You're making use of a hole in the rules, but it's not illegal or wrong in my opinion. The restaurant has that deal with Grubhub because they probably think of it as a loss leader - hoping people will use it and buy more stuff. Maybe gets them new customers, etc. You're taking advantage of it, but that's what it's there for. The restaurant will probably figure it out (soon!) and add a required minimum or something.

Unless it explicitly says ""new customers only"" or something, I think you're ok.  Maybe sometime when you're feeling flush, go over there and pay for a meal or two.

&#x200B;"
aebj8k,"If I understand things well, she's not here on these days, so I don't see why she should wash dishes that she didn't even use in the first place.
So I'd go with a very mild YTA."
aebjyg,"NTA, you offered multiple times to come home and she never said yes."
aeblhw,NTA. But you're not quite understanding what he's asking. A spotter isn't expected to be able to lift all the weight. A spotter is there to help the lifter through the last 1-2 reps when they are lifting about 80-90% of the weight and you need to help bring up that other 10%.

aebxjt,"YTA

She's dedicated her whole life to this thing, and when she vents you're like ""LOL, just consider quitting! I don't have dreams or ambitions, why should you?""

Good for her for breaking up with you. I hope she achieves everything she's set out to do with her life.

edit: Just noticed she hasn't broken up with you. Either I'd reconsider your words, and contritely apologize for not being supportive, or I'd reexamine your living situation and figure out what the next step is."
aec7mx,"Nta.  ""Rarely violent"" is still way too often.  Having to call the cops on someone is a big clue that you're in a bad relationship."
aec7ss,NTA. This is a case of majority rules. If it was the other way around where only 2-3 people wanted the blinds open then I would say you were an asshole. The workers refusing to adjust their monitors so the majority can be happy are just being selfish. Also to close all the blinds completely is just overkill. 
aec8dd,"YTA. Been an atheist with christian parents for 12 years since I turned my back on religion and they are fully aware. When they tell me they pray for me, I thank them. There's no reason to make your mother feel bad about something good she believes she is doing for you, that cannot possibly harm you, except if you're an asshole or want to hurt her for some reason. Apologize. We get that your logic is airtight but just apologize"
aeccl2,"NTA: Don't go out of your way to ""ignore"" them, but there is nothing wrong with waiting for them to reach out. Most of the time people are just busy and have other things on their mind. However if you are legit the only one making effort in the friendship, then it's not a friendship. Be careful who you do this to; you don't want to lose a true friend because you both lose touch."
aecerl,"YTA.

You had already committed to the trip with your girlfriend. To back out now because you’d rather go and party with your mates is 100% asshole behaviour. It sounds like you’re making up a load of excuses as to why the trip with your girlfriend wouldn’t be a good idea, but it basically boils down to you’d rather go with your friends. 

Maybe you need to evaluate whether you really want a girlfriend right now. You don’t sound like you’re really interested in saving the relationship. That’s totally fine if that’s how you feel, it’s your life and you have to do what makes you happy, but put her out of her misery and end it already if that’s the case. 

If that’s not the case and you want to stay with her, then you need to deal with the FOMO and put the effort in. There will be plenty of other opportunities to go out with mates"
aecksd,"NTA for selling the ticket and getting what you really want, but 100% the asshole for being ungrateful and whiny that your stepdad got a more expensive gift than you, get the fuck outta here with that garbage."
aecm8v,"NTA. Not to be a dick, but retail isn't like you're a CEO making big decisions and an equally big paycheck. Put in what you're getting out of it and that's it. You owe the company (and your friend) nothing more. "
aecr1l,NTA. I think youre just trying to create distance  so you can have space to heal and there is nothing wrong with that. (aside from when you slipped up and made out)
aecuah,NTA. There is practically no reason on earth to take a loan out for rent. Tell her to grow up and get a roommate like the rest of the world.
aed0qd,"NTA. You have to look after yourself. Your mother has clearly made her choice in life and that is to prioritise a man that abuses you over your health and wellbeing. Leave, cut him out of your life, and set boundaries with your mother that if she wants to remain in contact with you she is not to involve him."
aed3e9,"NTA she was using you, she would get you to pay for her gas/outings and not once paid you back despite having a job (probably similar pay to yours since same workplace) "
aed5r2,"NTA why do people ask this. If someone is using something you own, you have full control over if they get to use it or not"
aed8nw,"YTA. I don't think it's a generally accepted rule that passengers deserve to listen to whale noises instead of talk radio or someone talking on the phone or whatever. Certainly, you can ask for that and if they don't accommodate you can dock them stars if that's your thing. But the people that are going to get use of your rating aren't going to know why and will assume something about the person's driving skills"
aedf09,NTA. There are no rules in parking lots. They are the Wild West of our modern world 
aedhl1,"NTA. This isn't about the mountain, it's about the communication and respect in your relationship.

You: ""I'm really concerned about you doing this, can you wait a bit until I'm more comfortable?""

Him: ""You can't forbid me from stuff, I'm going to do it anyways.""

What would be nice to see is him saying, ""I understand how you feel, if it's this important to you I can wait. This is something I would like to do together."""
aedlg7,"NTA, but treat this as lesson learned. Never borrow or lend to friends and family."
aedr4r,NTA. She's your ex and has zero say on what you do or who you see. If this other girl has been there for you then it's absolutely appropriate for you to give her a get well gift. 
aedy21,"ESH - While you are clearly self-aware of your own shortcomings, you have continued to be complacent in them as well. 

Now, that doesn't excuse your father for being a massive friggin' jerk and destroying your property. But it also sounds like you lean pretty heavily on the more comfortable life that he affords you as well. 

You should do the best you can to change yourself to be a more productive person, and also probably just get away from him if he is so emotionally and physically destructive. 

That isn't healthy for anyone involved."
aee3ej,"Nta, I went through something similar and I know for me it wasn’t about the money it’s was about the lack of recognition for the things I’d done and the fact that people who couldn’t have given less of a shit were being rewarded. It’s hurtful."
aee49h,"NTA, ask him how he would've felt had he walked in on you naked. "
aee52p,NTA I would rather sit next to a smelly pot head or drunk on the bus than have them out on the road driving. Thanks for not driving while impaired. 
aeefa9,"Troll. There is no conspiracy of women united against you. You're just an asshole teenager. It is that simple. And your lack of understanding of even the most basic principles of feminism, combined with your edgelord level of douchery leads me to believe that you half subscribe to the nonsense you've written here and you're half hoping that your little fictional tale is just to garner a reaction out of people. YTA either way, and you know it because you're trying to be. Go to an incel forum with this shit and bask in your mindless, misinformed, self aggrandizing echo chamber."

aeg0zt,NTA Don’t go. If he wanted to go so badly he should’ve paid for the bed himself. You had a cheap alternative and he turned that down. Don’t go. He shouldn’t be putting all this on you. 
aeg5te,"YTA for trying to justify yourself in that context, not necessarily for posting the meme. Also asshole is probably too much. Just ignorant/insensitive"
aeg8e8,"NTA.

It sounds like your brother didn't want you there and your presence would have caused more harm than help. I'd suggest telling your parents about how your brother didn't want to see you but your family doesn't sound great either (for cutting off your cousin just because he's gay)."
aeg8lt,"NTA.

Your husband has consistent lied, omitted, and been cagey about his relationship with this woman. If he can't see why that makes it a sore spot for you, then he's not very considerate. The fact that they slept together when she was in a relationship also shows that she doesn't have a problem with infidelity. 

At any rate, I would say that as his wife, YOUR needs come first not hers. And, if he's worried about hurting her feelings by breaking off the friendship, then you really need to sit down and have a serious think about where this is going."
aegdqw,ESH. He shouldn't threaten over an Xbox controller but you shouldn't sell some after agreeing.
aegmv8,"NTA

Don't dish it if you can't take it. He was talking shit and you called him out for being an asshole.

Good one :)"
aegnsx,"NTA. It is unfair to you to expect you to hide your relationship and feelings for 3 years, let alone another 6. If she can't put you, and your relationship, as a priority for nine years, then you will always be second best to her and that relationship is doomed (or at the very least it's going to suck for you). I think you need to have a chat with her and be honest about what you want and need from a relationship."
aegw44,[deleted]
aegxbx,"NTA.

Your wife needs a psychiatrist, maybe even to be committed to a mental health facility... She's gone into full blown psychosis and letting her walk around with this delusion is only making it harder on herself. You need to take some initiative here and see what you can do to get her the help she needs."
aeh0no,"NTA. He doesn't seem to be aware of your feelings. And if he is aware, he's being a dick regardless of them. Have a serious talk with him about it since this appears to be a big issue. "
aeh3z4,NAH - I can understand only wanting a small party but they also just wanted to make you feel better

aehvp0,"As another gay guy I’m gonna say something that is gonna sound wrong to anyone else but you’ll know is true: a big part of our culture has, for a very long time, revolved around using alcohol on ourselves to be cool with doing what makes us feel weird or nervous or “wrong,” and we need to take some ownership of that. No question, yes, he should have been able to read your discomfort, or at least your inebriation, and recognize that you weren’t prepared for sex; but since so many of our consensual sexual acts have involved alcohol it can be hard to tell the difference sometimes. That said, good on you for choosing not to perpetuate that problem, and hopefully more of us get wiser and more comfortable in our own skin so we stop using alcohol to fuel our physical relationships.

I think you’re right that telling him that he sexually assaulted you will fuck him up. So I think you need to decide if that’s something you need to do in order to continue being friends with him. If you do, then ghost him permanently and don’t look back. If you don’t, then bury it as a product of the terrible mistakes that you both made, tell him you want to be friends but nothing more (because it sounds like he might be trying to hint at starting something up with you again) and just be his friend."
aehz3o,"NTA. She was hired to perform tasks that she failed to perform. It sounds like your family thought that because you had some success they could dump their useless offspring onto you and she could live off your successes. You did the right thing, not only by giving her a wake-up call and not rewarding her awful behaviour, but by giving a chance to someone who actually wanted to do the work."
aehzuq,I would say YTA if you said that to your kids. They didn't choose to be here. You should talk to your wife. Don't start by calling her selfish. You don't know how she feels about things. You need to sit down together and talk about it.

aejjxw,"YTA. Not for being rude but for being wrong. It’s much easier for children to learn two languages at once. I’m a nanny, and the nannys who speak languages other than English make so much more money, because everyone wants their babies and children to be around multiple languages at the same time. Her suggestion is a very common way of doing that but probably wouldn’t be my choice. I would probably work on both languages in all places. She’s probably interested in giving your kiddo a leg up in the world since being bilingual is huge professionally these days."

Kids don't have fully developed brains. Delaying gratification and impulsive control is much harder for them. Sometimes like a VR gaming system is an intense form of gratification that will create obsessive cravings. 

Honestly, it is probably best to either not allow him to use it at all or to set a simple to understand usage rule.  For example if the rule is ""you can play for 1 hour each day between these hours"" then you set a timer. You make it clear that in any day if he asks to use it more, he loses that day's hour of play time.  This allows clear easy to understand parameters and takes away the rewards for begging. "
aekrxk,"NTA. The ""character is adult in these photos"" is a bullshit loophole so people can feel better about making/watching porn starring children. I'm actually kind of shocked it's been mostly glossed-over in the comments here. 

Personally, I would be disgusted at the idea of my partner consuming any kind of porn that involves children, even fantasies. It would creep me out if the man I was with fantasized about children in sexual situations. 

If you're unwilling to leave him over this, I would at least seek out sex therapy as a couple, and probably for him on his own, as well. He does sound like someone with a porn addiction, at the very least, and if he's truly spending as much as you say on his fetishes and fantasies, then he's just going to keep escalating his indulgence until it affects you both financially. That's what addiction does. 

Sorry you have to deal with this. Situation is messy because you went through his stuff, but if that's his biggest issue with the conversation, I think you'll have your answer as to whether or not he's ready to change. Good luck."

An engagement ring is a conditional gift. If the wedding is called off it should always be returned if the person who purchased it wants it back. The value of the ring or the offenses of the partners don't matter.

I believe a quiceanera is a mexican girls 15th birthday, right? You could have danced with her, while also sending a signal that you're just friends. You could have not embarrassed her on her birthday, and while she put herself in that situation, I think she was just expecting you to say yes like most guys would if someone asked them to dance on a birthday.

 I've been in a similar situation at prom. A girl i didn't like asked me to dance in front of her friends. If i would've rejected her not only would she be hurt that I apparently can't even stand touching her, but now her friends would think shes a fool and that im an asshole. People would gossip about how the girl is sad and desperate.

So, I said sure. We danced. The world didn't end. She didn't end up pregnant with my child. We just had a good time, her friend took a picture, and we remained friends. Theres a way to do this without being really weird and hurting a girls feelings, though I would argue that in your case it was much worse because of the girls age and it being her birthday.

mental health is not an excuse to be toxic in your relationships in life so no you are not an asshole for expressing your feelings, yours are valid to. your not any less valuable because your mentally or emotionally stable.

af33bh,"You know it's a complicated issue when you find yourself agreeing with a NTA, NAH, and YTA judgment."
af36u5,"NTA, not at all. It's time for you to pull back from this relationship and not be there for her as much. It seems like the only thing she understands "
af38fs,NTA people coming over unannounced gets old fast. 
af3cwh,"NTA, everyone has different communication styles. Since you and your girlfriend don’t have the same style though you should really discuss this difference and how to overcome it. Continuing to let resentment fester on both sides is not going to end well. "
af3dba,"NTA. You didn't do anything wrong. Some FB users load up on ""friends"" and some don't. Personally, I don't do any FB friends unless I've either done business with you or have talked to you face-to-face or written Emails back and forth. But I don't have a problem with those out there who have 1,480 friends. I only have 54 and that's fine with me. Live and let live."
af3ex6,"NAH, I get your point, but if it's one night, surely people can stop their non-kid-friendly hobbies and habits? Hell, bust out some board games and have fun, that age can be pretty hilarious. "
af3mz6,NTA you have every right to not want to engage with your mom after she decided to stay with her husband despite what he did to you . I'm really sorry OP. That's fucking awful. 
af3oq1,NTA. You sound like you like your family despite the volume. You need a way to take breaks when you're visiting. Could you go for a drive in the country or something when it gets to be too much?
af3p0d,"YTA. If the attitude you display in that post is anything like you act in real life I'm not surprised that people don't want much to do with you. Yes, you have an antisocial personality disorder, but an explanation is not an excuse and it's certainly not a reason for other people to have to put up with a bad attitude or bad behaviour. Even in your post, you're focused on your success and how your siblings are less successful. Most people couldn't give a fuck about that shit. You even refer to people asking about your New Years as ""fuck heads"" even though by your own admission they didn't know you weren't there. "

af3siy,"NTA. Handicap bathrooms stalls aren’t the same as parking spaces, where you’re not allowed to use them if you’re able bodied. If it’s the only stall available, use it. It’s unrealistic and unfair to think you should have to pee your pants or worse if an open stall is available. "
af3tnh,YTA. You invaded her privacy. 
af3yfm,"NTA, but what did he say when you asked if he was happy?
Sexual frustration and unfullfillment is a seriously grating issue for your own wellbeing. It seems like you've done every single step correct up until now. Tried communicating til you're blue in the face, suggested counseling, etc. 

That's why I wonder what your husband says. If he is not happy, then you have something to work with. You can figure out the hows and whys together and hopefully with the help of a therapist. If he says he is perfectly content with how things have been, you'll have to ask yourself if it's worth it for you to continue to be in a relationship that you arent (and likely never will be) sexually gratified in. 

Also, not to pry, but what are your ages? Libido slumps with a lot of males around middle age, and there may be underlying medical/psychological issues that havent been addressed. (You mentioned ED)"
af403c," NTA for asking because she’s free to say no, she’s also free to be weirded out "
af42ay,"NTA. Even if he’s the world’s greatest dad when he’s not high, leaving him alone with a child that young while under the influence is not the right thing to do."
af4j22,"NTA.

This is a tricky one. You’re married; and your reasons are valid. I’m a woman married to a man, and I can’t imagine my husband not being weirded out by this honestly. Also, while struggling with fertility my sister volunteered without being asked to be our surrogate and it felt really.... not okay.... with both of us. (Ultimately, we took the adoption route and 3 1/2 years later just welcomed our 4 year old son into our family). 

I get your wife wanting to help her friend. But she has to respect her marriage too. "
af4jpu,"I'm pretty sure OP means ""grandmother"" 
Idk, that's what I call mine and that seems to make more sense here"
af4kz0,"YTA!! Are you kidding me? Either let her help, and let her stick around for an hour before the event starts, or if it’s REALLY going to be that much of an issue, contact her beforehand and ask her to please not show up until X time and not a minute before. Or just kindly, but firmly tell her to stay out of the kitchen. 

For the love of God, do not leave an elderly woman stranded in the cold because you can’t be bothered by somebody’s grandma for an hour on a holiday. "
af4qxn,"I can see where she's coming from then. But I think this is the line you have to draw when in a LDR. You can't take take your gf to the movies yourself but you're taking another girl. Even if you both are in relationships. It's just one of those circumstances.

That is just my opinion. I don't know your relationships dynamic but I'd cancel on the coworker out of respect for my partner."
af50dh,"NTA. You need to be more open and honest with him about how you feel but it seems like he’s kinda exploiting the situation so he doesn’t have to do much work around the house and he can spend more time gaming while you have to do chores and stuff. 

Relationships should be 50/50 effort and he’s not valuing your time or you as an individual if he’s making you do most of the work and he’s not spending any quality time with you "
af51mb,"We’ve had occasions, celebrations and milestones in our relationship that he didn’t find a need to take photos. He did however snap and uploaded photos of parties he recently attended over the holidays."
af5a28,"NTA

If you live together then you decide where to live, together "
af5ndn,"The honest, simple answer? ESH. But that’s not the main issue here. The main issue here is that you’re dating a man who is sexually coercive and manipulative, and you need a wake up call. Your relationship is toxic and unsustainable. I would normally say that both of you are terrible at communication and not ready to be in a relationship, but in this case it’s seriously not worth it. Leave. You can do so much better. Take some time after this to teach yourself that you deserve basic respect at least."
af5o9b,"NTA.  They removed items from a bag, but left the bag and some things still in the bag?   I've never seen a cleaner do that.  It seems like cover for them stealing the money.

You shouldn't leave money laying out like that though.

>It's not the first time they've thrown out things that I need, 

Talk to your mom about this.  She needs to set limits with them. Maybe one option for you is that they don't go in your room. You make sure all your stuff is in your room before the cleaners come, and you're responsible for cleaning your own room.  Maybe your mom can give you the difference in the cleaning fee each biweekly visit until it adds up to $200."
af5pvj,"NTA its very uncommon for people who used to date especially for a long time to be able to ""just talk"" they obviously still have feelings for each other."
af5ur5,"NTA, as this comes from a well earned resentment, even if it might seem petty out of context. Remember you only need them in your life as much as you want them there, and if too much contact is making you unhappy, you can limit it more."
af5xje,You told your friend you were done with his shit and he got upset? That's really weird. Also if your friend is a literal snake that's like the only sound he can make.
af5xsz,"ESH. It is manipulative. You absolutely shouldn't fake a medical incident to test people, not least of all because if they found out they'd be way less likely to take an actual incident seriously. That said, based on what you've described your friends sound terrible for not even putting in a little bit of effort to help you with your medical condition. "

af6byi,"NTA.  If she is accepting kisses and being groped, whatever she says, she is not wanting a serious or monogamous relationship, very few partners would accept this and she knows it, and you have to wonder what she “just plays along” with when you *aren’t* there.  "

Americans have a saying. “Make your bed and have to sleep in it”. It means that your situation is the result of your own actions and now you have to accept the consequences. C has constantly had sub-par work, misses deadlines, doesn’t integrate with the team, and so on.

C has made his bed. Now he has to sleep in it.

You have no responsibility towards him. Once he’s fired, you can keep an eye out for job opportunities that he would be qualified for, but you shouldn’t discuss the situation until he’s fired."

af78el,"NTA- but you need to step up in your own head and *not give him the power*  to ""make you feel like a child.""     
No one can make you feel any way unless you are complicit within yourself.

af7e5m,"Look at this from another perspective,

Why don’t you go with her if you want to spend more time with her? She’s only 20 it’s not like it’s abnormal to want to spend time with your family at that age.

af9p3r,"NTA- Frequent concert goer here; I'm the guy that wears earplugs and says excuse me. Nobody will ever, ever, ever be the asshole for dancing at a concert. 

Sometimes it's not as easy as ""booking a standing section rather than a seating section"" - standing sections are almost always closer to the stage and are almost always the highest value tickets. Tickets to Elton John ten years ago were nearly $200 for nosebleeds - I'd shudder to think what floor seats would cost today, but those tickets are almost always thousands of dollars.  Even if one *has* the money for floor seats, there's rarely a guarantee you'll get them. I personally waited in the online ticket queue for a prime show for two hours before tickets were due to go on sale, and the best seats available to me were still in the second balcony level, on the side, halfway up. I was ready to spend big boy bread for this event; the problem is I never got the opportunity to spend big boy bread for floor tickets. 

OP should NOT be shamed for enjoying an all-time legend in concert! Were you drunk and spilling beer on this lady? Were you hollering out every obscenity in the book? Were you physically encroaching on the space of others - that is, did you leave the seating and standing area assigned to your ticket? If you answer no to all three of these questions, proceed as you may and have a **GREAT** time.

EDITED to include: It doesn't matter if it's an indoor or outdoor concert. It's a concert. Concerts are held outside in the summertime and inside in the winter time. If Elton John performed the exact same set the exact same way outside, what exactly would it be that would make it appropriate to dance at the outside set but not at the inside set? It's preposterous. 

Also going to include that as a performing musician, *the one thing we DO want is to see people dance.* You're not watching a sonata, you are at a rock and roll concert. "
af9tr1,"NTA, as long as you did actually ask her and not just rock up home and yell at her for not realising you expected her to make dinner."
af9u0b,"Definitely NTA. Unless you're leaving out some major information, it seems she had every opportunity to go with you. Why would you have waited until 8:30 to leave otherwise? Your mom sounds like she doesn't deal well with plans changing, but that's no reason for her to be passive aggressive and blame you for it. "
af9yyu,"YTA. I know you mean well, but you don’t know why she’s depressed. It’s not neccesaily jealousy, and if there is a bit of that in there, it’s not all that. Also, you might not know how she thinks of the people you deleted. They might mean a lot to her. It might be the only way she keeps in touch with them. "
af9z2i,"IMO, NTA for asking why she apologized or rejecting it. From what I've read, you sound like a person who thinks someone shouldn't apologize for doing what they want to, which is fine. It's also okay to reject an apology. You're hurt, you need time to heal, and she isn't helping you. You don't even need to accept the apology ever, if you don't want to. Just don't let it become who you are.

&#x200B;

As for her, she's not being great for stringing you along while dating someone else either. Seems like she still doesn't know what she wants, doesn't mean its okay to dot that. Ending a relationship abruptly is also an asshole thing to do. Sounds like she just had a wake-up call that this isn't what she wanted and felt she needed to get out immediately and she's apologizing to you because it wasn't fair to you how she did it.

&#x200B;

You'll be fine eventually, OP. You're entitled to your feelings and honestly you seem to be dealing with this in a non--asshole way. Good luck."

afaiu4,"NTA 

She lied to you for almost a year and when you confronted her about it she tried to convince you to return to your unhealthy ways (by the way, awesome job on losing 110 pounds). 

She doesn't seem to care about her health nor about yours, and I honestly believe that any relationship with her would be an unhealthy one (double entendre was accidental, but not unwanted)."
afat4z,"ESH kind of. I don't think anyone is an asshole as much as you both are just lying to yourselves. First by saying you're not dating but you talk all the time, make an effort to visit and meet each other's parents. That's dating in my book. You can call it what you want but that's what it is. Also, you say you're fine with polyamory while in the same breath say how crushed you were when you find out she's dating someone else. So again, maybe you say you're fine with it but you're pretty clearly not in every case.

I think you are the type of guy who can get women (not holding that against you because you seem at least kind of modest about it, and it's true, some guys just have that thing women are very attracted to) and you want it both ways. You want to be this lady's man for lack of a better word but also be a one woman guy if it's the right woman. 

Frankly, if the lady's man thing was actually fulfilling you you wouldn't be so broken up over this girl. In my experience, that lifestyle has a shelf life and your heart and mind are ready to start living a different way. I would listen. Problem is, it's going to have to be a different girl. There is too much history and being with someone from your past makes it hard to move forward. I don't think you're a genuine asshole, I just think you're in a bit of denial. Best of luck."
afaw9k,"NTA.
You are not in the wrong at all. That money was meant for you and he basically stole it. 
In my opinion you have every right for wanting him to pay it back. He also seems like an ass in general, using the ""you're not my favorite anymore"". That's mental abuse at its finest and I really think you should leave if you can."
afawyx,"Feelings don’t make you an asshole, actions do. So right now you are NTA at all.

I think what she is doing is kinda shitty but you both are still young. 18-22 is an awkward time to be in a committed relationship because sudden changes between being complete in love to wanting to date around can happen quickly and they don’t always have a reason. "
afazjq,"NTA if they can’t keep their child under control at an event other people paid for, they shouldn’t have brought the child. Many theaters now offer options for kids and families with disabilities, if that even was what was going on here, although to me it just sounds like some crappy parenting. "
afb1lp,"NTA. Maybe clear it up with him that you feel bad and explain where you're coming from. Just say that you appreciate the offer, but you genuinely enjoy walking home. Seems like he was coming from a good place, but if it made you uncomfortable at least you made your point clear."

Newborn babies, people in scooters, kids have all seem to piss you off, but they're all people who are in their right to be at Disneyland too.

afb85z,"NTA.

You're trying to help her with something she told you she wanted, if she's not willing to put in the effort that's her issue and she shouldn't take it out on you.

Maybe try talking to her? Ask her if there is something she would like to take up instead of running with you? I was in a similar position to your girlfriend, and my reasoning was I was too embarrassed to work out with my SO because my fitness level is significantly lower.

Hope you two get this resolved!!"
afbaln,"NTA - My first question: are you positive she actually IS pregnant and are you positive it would be yours? If you were using protection perfectly the possibility of that happening is so slim.

It would be one thing if she asked to move in with you and raise the baby. But demanding you come home and give up being a lawyer? No. 

I’d demand a paternity test before offering to pay for a single thing related to that child if you did in fact use protection every time perfectly. "

afbkjn,"NTA at all. You were a victim of a horrific thing, and I'm terribly sorry you went through that. You owe the person who victimized you absolutely nothing, regardless of their familial relation to you (which makes what they did all the worse). And furthermore, his memory or lack thereof of the events has no bearing on the fact that they happened and they were traumatic for you.

afbn5r,"NTA if you made it clear that you didn’t like the situation he should have talked to you about it.

afc07f,"NTA. You tried to coordinate this and it's a difficult situation, especially since it's not like you have some authority here beyond the fact that your teacher ask you to get everyone to make rooms. Personally, I think the best way to go about this would be to just have a sheet and go to everyone and ask them to sign their name in groups of four for who they want to room with. 

If no one told you until the last moment that they were uncomfortable, and they agreed with it, then I don't see the issue. You could switch yourself and B and ask her if she'd mind so it doesn't seem like there's any conflict with the original rooms.

In the end, I'd be concerned about whether B would have a bad time being in a room with people that don't want her there (and explicitly told you about it as their reaction to finding out she'd be in the room). "

afcjju,"NTA but the way you carry yourself makes it hard for others to connect with you.

  


1. Don't pressure yourself to find a perfect response in a conversation. Easier said from an internet stranger than done, but it's okay to let the conversation flow and stuff and jist listen. If you wanna say something, try, but otherwise sounds like it's okay to let others talk.

  


2. There's two ways to think about the phrase ""people don't care"". You can choose to interpret it as everyone is either disinterested in/disliking you. OR give yourself some slack! Everyone makes mistakes. Heckydecky I sound confident IRL but no way am I 100% perfect or have foresight or living unawkwardly. A lot of times people are their own worst critics and worry about how they're like or act instead of judging others.

Also sometimes labels get in the way. It's okay to notice certain situations are uncomfortable, but to group all these interactions as failures is injustice to you and your life! Try to think of the little achievements you've done so far. From this post alone, this internet stranger is proud of your efforts to reach out (to the program and in this post)! It's a very brave thing and every little step to improvement is improvement. I hope you can pride in your own actions and feel more comfortable opening up to the group.

  


On a side note tho, it might seem like everyone is cohesively socializing and talking to each other and I'm sure it's just the more noticeable side of the grouo. You're on your own journey, no need for comparisons, and will be able to socialize too! Maybe go and ask if you can join a convo, and listen. Who knows?"
afcoyz,"NTA - I think you are indeed ""well within your rights"" to take a holiday that you are paying for in a any way you like. It sounds like you've been more than reasonable in agreeing to meet them for part of your holiday, and they should respect that. Let them know that there are parts of your trip that you can't/won't change, but you'll happily meet them here on this day...etc. Perhaps even do some research to find and suggest places that they can stay (and you can perhaps sneakily find some places not too near to where you'll be!)"
afcp84,NAH... it sounds like a tough situation. She need to seek help to better manage her mental health issues. You need to learn how to handle speaking to her about her mental health issues. Telling her that her symptoms are made up or that’s she’s being dramatic will make her think that you don’t believe or trust her. Her constantly unloading her fears and anxiety on you is going to drive you insane.
afcpui,"NTA because you kept a promise and also had no obligation to tell him, especially if he wasn't interested in S.

afcr1a,"NTA, obviously.

Why the hell did your mom let them move in in the first place?

You can look into getting a chain lock for the laundry room - it would keep it just open enough for the cat to get in and out but make it so the baby can't get in. Also, where is your brother in all this? The baby is just as much his responsibility as his girlfriend's. This whole situation is fucked."

I didn't need to read your post to say that, but I did read it. Would they check with your personal life and make sure it was a good time before firing you? You far exceeded common courtesy by offering two months to begin with. Also, any company suffering from high turnover that can't manage without a single staff member is horribly run and you should have left sooner. "
afczas,"NAH. She's asexual. You're not. You have both discussed your needs, you've tried an open relationship. It's not working for either of you. You may love each other, but this relationship is going to turn toxic to you both if you can't find a way for you both to be happy. You've both tried. You can end the relationship knowing you both tried everything you were comfortable doing. It will hurt, but it will hurt more to stay together. "
afd75f,"ESH. You were an asshole (as were your friends) for picking on Jimmy -- *yes, you were* -- it doesn't matter that you were drunk. Jimmy was an ass for reacting the way he did. But, his reaction does not excuse your asshole reaction after his freak-out.

> i know it sounds rude but if you're drunk and within reach of hash browns who wouldn't grab one??

Lots and lots and lots of people."

Also, she’s gaslighting you. "
afe025,"NTA, you are NEVER the asshole for being upset that someone is expressing racism around you, even if that person is your father. These people saying you're the asshole are nuts. "

afe8ut,"YTA for wanting to leave your kids behind. NTA if you follow through with your commitment to support them.  

Seriously though, what did you expect? Your wife married a man. You seem to be lamenting their lack of support, but did you expect your wife to become homosexual? Aren’t people born homosexual? "
afegqw,"NTA He's prioritising his career over your career, your home, friends, family, and comfort in a country I assume you enjoy living in. "
afer4g,"NAH. You should've asked, he should've have reacted nicer. Just seems really minor."
afezyc,"YTA. 
Why would that person take you seriously after behaving so childishly/rude? If your ex has NPD then why talk so lightly about it and in such a way as you did? Then on top of that you probably did this exchange in front of your kid. 

You both need to grow up and show respect 
for each other even if it hurts you inside for your kid’s sake! What he/she sees you both doing is what a normal relationship look like in his/her eyes and will treat others in this way. "
aff07z,NTA. FYI Do not delete your submission once a discussion has begun
aff34i,"NTA. Except for the wording. “Not letting” someone not work is not the right way to put it. She makes choices about what she wants to do (not work); you make choices about how you want to respond (not date her, not support her financially, or do those things). To phrase it like you did makes it seem like you believe you’re a grownup and she’s a child. "
aff41d,"ESH. Pretty straight forward. You should have made an effort to call out both of your issues and work on them, if you actually cared about maintaining the relationship. She could have been less sucky by the sound of it."
aff7iz,Nta but I would honestly wait till you’re engaged to have that conversation. No point in starting a fight for nothing right now. 
affd4z,NTA but kinda surprised you still want to date with the tone. Good luck. 
affdkz,"NTA verging on SHP. As written you're clearly not the asshole. If your an adult, get your shit together, move out and cut all contact with your mother. If you're not an adult, record your mother's abuse and report it to CPS. It's up to you whether or not you give your dad and brother another chance, but if you did then set boundaries and be prepared to cut them out as well."
affemq,"NTA. That guy is clearly just a manipulative fuck and you should do your best to help your friend move on and get rid of him.

Keep in mind though, if they break up don’t go straight to just shit talking him to try and be supportive. That can often drive the person back to them.

Just be supportive and help them whenever you can. Make sure that you get them to do stuff so they don’t go into some kind of depressed state and end up longing for that person back.

(On a side note, if you record when the person makes the sexual comments about your underage friend you can send those to the FBI and they may start an investigation into him. Just remember the more you have the better. Your friend will probably be upset with you if you do though.)"
affhmm,"**YTA**  


I've flown quite a bit in the past and while I understand jet lag, I just don't really think it's that big of a deal as long as you take proper precautions ahead of time and prepare yourself. You are also blaming jet lag on a flight a day later, I'm calling bullshit on that and saying you are using that as an excuse, even if you won't admit to it here.   


You also mentioned that you hadn't eaten all day. Jet Lag is a psychological sleep disorder based on changing time zones. So what was preventing you from eating before, during or after your flight?  


You even admitted that you have a "" sedentary lifestyle"" and have ruined dates in the past because of it. All I am reading is you are lazy and refuse to get up off your ass.   


Your friends aren't wrong, your health and well being is important, but you weren't going to die from jet lag and you basically admitted the whole thing was your fault, so why are you even coming on here and asking if you were an asshole or not?  


I would have kicked you out too and if what you claim is true and you have a habit of ruining dates, I'd be looking for someone new. "
affir0,"NTA. 

This is completely on her, especially since you didn’t even know until after. Her choice to cheat, her choice to stay and share intimate details about her relationship. It sucks that she put you in this spot, but you shouldn’t just treat her like garbage and change who you are because of her mistake. I wouldn’t keep in contact with her even if she broke up with her boyfriend though. Can’t be trusted. A lot of people in long distance relationships have flings and want a booty call when they’re feeling low. They suck, and they are using you in every sense of the word. She’s a piece of shit, you aren’t an asshole. "
affiwd,"NTA. Your mother is. A big one to be honest. She enabled her behaviour at every point here. If she wants to know why you two can't get along, it's because of the decisions she's made (like you getting in trouble whether she did her chores or not, especially when you were doing her a favour by babysitting). She's your mum's problem now, wash your hands off the lot of them and go enjoy your life."
affk4h,"NTA. You didn't get him fired, he got himself fired by fucking up. You made a complaint based on bad service. Whether he was fucked up or just incompetent is pretty irrelevant. He's being paid to perform a task, if he can't perform it then he doesn't get paid."
affvlh,"NTA. Your mom has only herself to blame for this situation.

~~How does your GF feel about this?~~"
afg01b,"NTA. Speaking as someone with autism, I much prefer bluntness to someone beating around the bush and being indirect with their communication. Also, autism is no excuse for not pulling his weight in the project. If the autism were truly a problem, he should have brought it up with the professor. "

afgaj3,"NTA, she should pay more attention to her child's responsibilities and understand your priorities. You were mostly in the right, except about losing your cool."
afh1wm,"NTA. Girl...I dont want this to hurt... but that is some shady shit. Considering the past you already know what hes doing. I would get a babysitter and go there now and catch him and fuck him up. I could be wrong, I hope I am but damn I wouldn't let that fly. Dont waste your youth on someone who would treat you like that. Good luck."
afh38n,NTA. Three apologies for what? You didn't do anything. She *must* be joking. I'm a pretty empathetic person and I have no idea what you did that *made her* throw up. If she's throwing up that's on her and you need to make sure her parents know. 
afh5r3,"ESH

Your lifestyles are not meshing.

Congratulations on your recovery, but he is not in the same boat. You’re both on different cruises.

Your issue is trying to fine him to change who/what he is.

His issue is ignoring your needs.

One of you needs to make a decision.

Either you’re both agreeing on how to handle nights out.

Or one of you needs to make the decision to move on"
afh8zn,"INFO

Falling out with her roommates? What did that entail?

Falling outs can range, wildly "
afhfpv,"YTA. Not on purpose, but seriously dude you need to guard your passport with your life when you're travelling. More importantly, are you sure it wasn't stolen? From memory, passports are really fantastic for ID theft. I think you know you need to make it up to your GF, maybe surprise her with something once everyone has managed to get past this."
afhio1,NTA.  What would you apologize for?  At no point in this did you do anything wrong.  Why would this guy get more say than the rest of the band who actually bother to show up?
afhm4d,"NAH. What happens in your brain stays in your brain.  We all have less than savory fantasies, and if this one makes you a better piano player all the better.   Unfortunately, when she actually dies -- it will be *nothing* like you've been fantasizing. Nothing you are doing now will inure you."
afht61,"NTA. She was joking around already and you obviously said that in a joking matter, she must’ve not seen it that way I guess."
afhuwz,"NTA (but you definitely shouldn't have taken him back)

Come on, you know you're not the asshole. He said he wanted you to die and is abusive. I know it's terrifying but you have to break up with him before you DO end up dead. 

Definitely call the cops on him if he tries anything too. "
afhwj6,"NTA, just be careful in your approach. Don't make demands, just let her know that there are times when you would rather not have him in your apartment"
afhxp6,NTA. Would she really mind you cancelling? She basically gets four sessions' worth of fees without needing to work for it lol. So I don't think it's a problem. If you're really worried about hurting her feelings say you're gonna be really busy at work/school etc for the next few weeks.
afi3f3,NTA and your family is petty as hell lol 
afi3vm,"YTA. Not a smart prank to make considering it actively involves staff members, and Ani could’ve easily mistaken it for a genuine email. Also not smart to assume Ani would never get it, as in this professional context she’s probably often searching staff members names in her email, making sure she hasn’t missed any correspondence, etc. 

From the way you’ve described it it seems like Ani’s reaction was out of proportion from what you expected. But from her perspective, she was already stressed about her lack of correspondence from staff members, now she’s extra distressed at a confusing and potentially malicious email she’s received with no context, and she simply reported it to the appropriate channels. 

It’s unfortunate that it became a much bigger issue than you intended, but it was ultimately a dumb thing to do, and it caused a lot of unnecessary extra stress for your friend."
afiapq,"NTA. If she needed a loaf of bread then she should have come before closing time, simple as that."
afidhq,"NTA, the suicide attempt (and how you glossed over it), speaks volumes. Get out of that situation, go with your old man"
afiekt,"NAH It doesn’t even sound like she was faking but more that she wasn’t sure what an orgasm was supposed to feel like and thought she’d had them until she had a real one.

This isn’t super unusual from girls who don’t masturbate that are just starting out with their sex lives. 

I can also understand you being hurt that your memory of the period isn’t what you thought but honestly it doesn’t matter, she wasn’t sure how to get to orgasm herself and neither were you, it happens, you’re young. "
afif0e,"NTA. Is this a SHP? because all of this is obvious. Your birthday should be about you and you only. Hell, a regular date should be about you and you only. "
afiffe,"I don't understand, hadn't he called 911 already? What were you going to do there? Help the police?

Idk, maybe I'm just a bit old-fashioned, but I would be absolutely pissed off if my girlfriend had this kind of relationship with her ex, and apparently your BF thinks the same but just never told you until now.

YTA."
afijrs,"NTA. You’re not a babysitter. Yes you should be supportive and there for your boyfriend but within reason. You wouldn’t blow off an important work meeting or other event to sit at home and look after him. This is an important family event for you, it’s your brother’s birthday and your last chance for almost a year to see your other brother and to all spend time as a family. Go! Your boyfriend will surely be fine alone for a few hours, or can spend time with his own family or friends if he wants some company. You cannot be the only person he relies on for support and you cannot be expected to drop all your other commitments to be there for him. It’s doesn’t sound like he’s asking you to do that either so I guess he is also NTA and there are NAH."
afjlca,"NTA: while I feel calling her out in the server was a bit overkill, I personally extremely dislike plagiarism. If you feel comfortable enough taking credit for someone else's work, you should be prepared to be called out. Not to mention tricking your friends is a dick thing to do"
afjnm2,"NTA. You are not responsible for his mental health, regardless of what he does. You did your part, you tried to get him to get help, he ignored you and continued to be manipulative and push your boundaries. "
afjqd7,You need new friends.
afk3x9,NTA. Behavior like this is why she wasn't invited. 
afk72e,"NTA. Can you really consider someone a friend if they don't know the most basic/normal things about your personal life (like the existence of a long-term SO)? It's shady and weird, and there must be a reason that he didn't tell you and acted so awkwardly when you went up to his table. It's definitely a red flag and not normal between ""friends"". "
afk7qh,NAH but you need to grow the hell up. You can sit at home alone after school as much as you want but it's your last year. Sit with somebody and get those social skills so that when you have a job you don't whine about how Greg from accounting sits next to you in the coffee break. 
afkfug,"NTA but your attitude absolutely stinks.

I don't see why she stays with you, not because you won't give her the money for the dog, I probably wouldn't either. But it sounds to me that instead of letting her down gently, and supporting her without being her walking piggybank, you tell her to ""go fuck herself"". Get some respect. "
afkixn,"NAH. But she is right on a couple of things: your weight is YOUR responsibility. And even if she buys a ton of food, you DON'T have to eat it. 

Now, I understand that it's hard to focus on eating healthy portions when there's a ton of junk food in the house and massive meals being made. 

Arguing isn't going to help anything, and you're probably not going to change her mind. Focus on YOUR health. Do what you can to get healthier. 

I've recently lost a bunch of weight and I found it really easy to do by combining keto and intermittent fasting. That's allowed me to eat a big meal and still lose weight. You might take a look at some of the communities on here like /r/keto (especially /r/ketoxx if you're a woman) and /r/omad. Good luck!"
afkn3m,"NTA. You might have had some money set aside, but if it would have meant not making your mortgage/bills for the month then it wasn't really *extra* money. Your mom is likely clouded by her grief for her father. It's not fair of her to take that out on you, though. "
afknna,Get a new boyfriend who doesn’t act like a spoiled brat. 
afkva9,"YTA and kind of dramatic. Christ, that read like middle school lol"
afkvco,SHP
afkyrf,"NTA- I don't know anything about Chinese culture but just NTA, a grown woman should have been up for discussion and compromise, especially at a child's birthday party "
afl15b,"NTA.  You and your girlfriend have been together far longer than your parents.  Your parents are ones who are making it weird.  If anything, your friends probably think it's weird that your parents got married and are trying to break the two of you up after six years."
afl5g8,"NTA he can use his laptop for work. If he wanted to check facebook or his email thats different, but I wouldn't let anybody download something on my laptop, especually not software that allows sharing of enviornments."
afl6aa,YTA if you don't discuss the bills before hiring and charging her.  Talk to her about needing a cleaning service to help out because of how messy it is.  You can't clean up after her too.
afl6m8,"If you all split rent evenly, I don’t believe you have a right to veto something. I think you should talk to your roomates and ask for advance notice for these types of things, so you can remove yourself from the home for a few hours. Because mainly, you are the problem. You are the one that gets sick from the scent. (I understand though because the same thing happens to me.) I would definitely call out them not properly cleaning up after, but that applies to any activities that take place in the apartment. (Dinner=dishes. Spill pop=mop, etc)"
aflml5,"NTA I think, I would say everyone sucks because of you only wanting her for sex that one time, but like, you've apologised profusely and she pretty much put your life in danger to make up for it along with all that other shit she expected of you, so I'd say you've more than made up for that. I think she is using you btw. I also think you are far more invested in this relationship than she is

It's not really fair for her to ask so much of you but blow you off when you ask to meet up, you gave her plenty of opportunities to tell you she wasn't going to be able to make it or wasn't feeling up to it and she still left you hanging. Honestly let her go. I don't think this relationship is good for either of you tbh"
aflo5p,"NTA — she’s outstayed her welcome. Sometimes even good friends can’t live together. Living together makes relationships weird, so even if she didn’t try to humiliate you, you wouldn’t be an asshole for asking her to move out. You never said it would be permanent. 

Good luck! "
aflub1,NAH. Obviously you have every right to keep the wind chime up. Moving it to the other side of the porch sounds like a good compromise. I would definitely say talk to them before you take any firmer of a stance and would recommend the same to them. Talk it out and try to reach a common ground
aflujj,"YTA ghosting is a really terrible thing to do to somebody. If it's ever happened to you, you would know. Unless your friend has always acted like this from the beginning of your friendship, YTA"
afm3dg,"NTA you are right a 5 year old should be sleeping in her own room. I'm mean this also has to affect y'all being intimate, that can't be healthy for a relationship. "
afm6hr,NTA. Ask yourself if you really want to spend the future with someone who can't be honest about something as little as a wedding +1. 
afm9tb,"NTA. You're unsure how to deal with it and that's okay, but avoiding your problems rarely makes them go away.

I think you should speak privately to one of her friends or to her directly if you can and explain kindly that you don't want to upset anyone but you're just not interested. "
afmf4k,"NTA at all, he needed to be called out. If he didn't want to be called out in public then he shouldn't have acted like a dick in public"
afmgw9,"Ops mom is being a bitchy asshole because op did their chores, and more *for the wrong reasons*

Instead of doing it in honor/praise/fear of bitch mom. "
afmjx7,"Sounds to me that your mom is TA.

 Your poor father has been paying through the nose, alimony, child support plus additional costs when you are under his care. He should absolutely not have to foot the bill for everything and your mom needs to step up.

I feel you should be advocating for your father in this, however I dont think this makes you an asshole if you want to stay out of the dispute.

Being 18 years old do you not have a job? Can you not assume some of the financial burden for your own existence?

If you are suffering from Suicidal thoughts and depression you should talk to someone."
afmobf,"NTA- she shouldn’t be pointing the blame if she’s spending money wastefully. Although it would definitely help your family if you get a job, if you are trying she can’t blame you for shit. Hope ur okay bro, stay strong."
afn6je,"Nah, NTA. I can understand not wanting to get sick. I think it’s a little rude to not even try and take care of your sick gf of over a year. He could at least stop by and hand you supplies at the door instead of just saying you should probably get it"
afnasu,NTA. Abusive family isn't family at all.
afnavt,"NTA. He can risk his own life for selling and growing weed, but you have no obligation to. I wouldn’t either. And it doesn’t make you the asshole if you break up with him over it either. You have expectations for your life, and presumably they don’t include visiting your partner in prison. That makes sense. If it makes you uncomfortable and you’ve expressed that, the only appropriate reaction from him is, “okay cool, no big deal. We won’t do that then.” "
afneal,NTA protect your cat. He should be kicked out not enabled. 
afnwiy,"YTA, read the room idiot. It was new friends. They probably think you're the biggest douchebag on the planet with zero social skills. "
afnyrc,"Then honestly? My ruling is NAH.

You’re not an asshole for wanting someone to be romantic, but neither is she because you two are young are love is weird and maybe she’s just not sure and doesn’t want to hurt you. It’s hard to say without knowing her side as well. 

You’ve both got a lot of life ahead of you, and I’m not saying you can’t have already found the one for you, but I’m saying you need to really consider whether this is right. Yes, you broke up for a week and you didn’t feel complete. It’ll likely take more than a week to feel “normal” after a break up. And it doesn’t seem that you feel complete and fulfilled right now either. 

I only know this snapshot that you’ve posted of your story, but I just think it’s something to consider. "
afo3pn,"NTA. Friends shouldn’t be therapists. There’s a reason why therapists go through years of school and get paid hundreds of dollars an hour.

You can’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm. If helping her was affecting your own mental health, you have every right to stop helping her. Especially if she’s not taking your advice. Friendship is a two-way street and she’s going to have a very hard time in life if she doesn’t learn that because she will absolutely push away every friend she has."
afo5nz,"NTA you offered to try making her recipe later, which is a beyond reasonable compromise that your mother irrationally rejected. "
afo6c1,"NTA - God, I've been there. Actually ended up studying medicine but that's cause I enjoyed the hands on experience as an EMT. Compromised by taking a non science major. Here's my two cents OP, you must live your own life. It's not your parent's. It's not any other member of your family. It's yours. You're still young and have a lot of time to choose what you want to do. But never go into a field because someone else wants you to do it. Make it your own choice. I understand how controlling parents can be but at the end of the day, this your life. Live it the way you want to. Best of luck."
afoaor,"NTA, this guy belongs in r/niceguys it sounds like, and it is entirely reasonable to try to get people away from him when he has a history of harassing women. "
afoaz1,"YTA

How DARE you even consider this?? It is your responsibility as a pet owner to develop a strong bladder that allows you to not pee for HOURS in emergency situations like this.

What else, you MOVE your dog when he takes up all the space in your bed instead of doing the right thing and lie at the very edge almost falling off as long as you don't disturb him??"
afog3v,"NTA and that lady has no life. I almost feel like this is a shitpost because that is such a strange reaction. You should have just told her you liked her mug so much that its your home mug.

But on another note Christmas fucking sucked this year for me. I got so many useless fucking gifts layng around the house. An oreo eating kit (basically some plastic tongs and a mug) turned out to be my favorite gift. I bought someone a fucking crossbow."
afoi56,"YTA - getting annoyed at your GF for how she is tracking her calorie intake is bordering on controlling behaviour. You should be supporting her towards her goals instead of scolding her. 

Talk to her about why exactly she wants to lose weight (looking slimmer, general health benefits, being stronger?) and then help motivate her to take action to get there rather than getting irrationally angry. 

It’s worth reminding her that muscle weighs more than fat so if she is going to the gym and getting stronger this could be why she isn’t seeing the change she is expecting. That doesn’t mean she isn’t making positive progress. 

"
afoihe,[deleted]
afoiot,"YTA or this is a SHP. Are ya serious?  

NVM, I've read your other posts, you're just an idiot. "
afojro,"NAH. How about compromising by only being there for 3-5 of those days, since you are paying for yourself? A 40th anniversary is kinda a big deal and it'd probably break your parents' hearts if you didn't celebrate with them at least a little bit."
afoqug,Unless you’re offering to help her with the manual labor YTA. You don’t even know what she was doing in the garden? Assuming it was something that needed to be done what solution are you offering besides making your mom feel bad about how it’s affecting her health? Did you offer to do it? Have you asked if her doctor has perhaps recommended physical activity as a way to manage her health? I think asking questions and offering support will get you further than just making her feel bad about her health. That’s not very helpful. 
afora3,"NTA

/r/choosingbeggars

Jesus Christ. I would tell her off and never speak to her again. What a rude, selfish, entitled person. You do not owe her a career, and she needs to pull her bootstraps up and get hired because she's *qualified*, not because she intimidated someone into doing all the work for her.

At this point you do *not* even owe her a reference and I would personally not give one to her as you would be vouching for someone who would end up being equally difficult in the workplace as she is being to you now which would make you look bad. I would never want to work with this person.

"
aforvk,"NAH, it's better that it get used by someone that'll enjoy it than just sit there and collect dust and dog bite marks. Plus, you'd likely feel similarly guilty for keeping it and not using it. "
afoti5,Nta - sounds like she’s a nosy ass who should have stayed out of your relationship 
afovc2,"NTA, but I have an idea. Interact cordially with your mother one last time in front of your grandparents so that they can have some peace of mind before they go.

afpd1z,"You should ask about this at /r/legaladvice.

I'm just going to ask though:
If she's been living there, she has a legal right to get in. So, if she gets in, turns on the water in the bathroom, plugs the bathtub, and walks out, do you have flood insurance? Because something similar happened to a guy across the street from me.

Really pissing someone off, telling them it's over, and then leaving all your stuff unprotected is.....

Anyway, have a nice vacation."
afpgdx,I would leave her but thats on you. You gave her an option and she didnt choose you even though she said she fid.
afphkx,"NTA this girlfriend sounds like she sucks. 
Please leave this housing situation after the lease is up living with a couple means it will always be two against one. 
Can’t believe she ever made you guys return the first cat that’s just horrible. If no one is allergic and the landlord allows it what is the argument against the cat even? "
afpkdv,NTA. Also dont tell her anything that was supposed to be a secret.
afpldk,"NTA. You were genuinely concerned about whether you two were meeting up or not, and he disappeared weirdly in the middle of confirming plans. Very strange time to change his mind. I think you dodged a bullet with this one. "
afpy8o,"YTA. ""I began to freak out a bit and warned him that I might say something uncalled for?"" If you have that kind of self control, just don't say anything uncalled for, you know? You probably shouldn't be friends with this guy. Clearly neither of you is handling it well. "
afq42x,you need a reality check that not every man is the exact same cigar smoking beer drinking construction worker etc man. It’s up to them. You offering advice is  not extremely polite but not assholeish but the way you did it yeah YTA
afq4yv,Sounds like she calls it cheating. NAH but maybe clue her in sooner. I assume you at least committed to some ERP which she has taken issue with.
afq79i,"NTA.  He might be your father, but he sure ain't your dad. 

There's a saying that applies to your situation: you're not obligated to set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.  If your father wanted your help, he should have been a good parent. "
afqbar,"NTA

It’s your money, you do what you want. Explain to him that you don’t believe the farm thing would be worth it as you don’t usually do much on the weekend, but you’ve always wanted to see Wicked."
afqcuw,"NAH

you thought your friend's mom told your mom the details, and they hadn't. your mom is upset because she wants you to be able to go to things you want to attend, but she made prior plans. she's feeling guilty (and therefore annoyed) because she feels like she should drive you but she didn't know anything was happening. she was pushing for details because she was wondering if she'd be able to drive you before her scheduled plans. source: am mom"
afqezb,"NTA

I think you have the right to be hurt by these inconsiderate things your friend consistently does to you culminating in a secret marriage (?!?).

But you have to tell your friend how you feel. Some people are super oblivious and don't understand how they affect others and it will honestly help you to have some closure whether they apologize or not."
afqluc,"ESH. They’re an asshole for making fun of you but you’re an asshole for retaliating, what the insults are about are pretty irrelevant. "
afqmre,NTA? Maybe you (And I know this may sound harsh but it's not intended to be mean) aren't ready for a relationship. If you find it so unbearable to spend time with him and he seems to be getting tired and less compassionate then it seems that the relationship is dying and maybe not meant to be. While you aren't the asshole you certainly aren't playing your part in the relationship with you avoiding him and all. I'd wait until you get the professional help to get better before pursuing a relationship with someone.
afqnf1,"NTA. You are never the asshole just because you don't want to have sexual relations. Your reasons are immaterial. ""No"" is a complete sentence and that alone should be sufficient justification. That being said.... you ***do*** have very good reasons for not wanting sex."
afqr6s,NTA. Also... Hell with the cat. Call CPS for the children. 
afqs6h,"NTA

Ok, so. You’re not the asshole here, but you can’t really do anything about it with your wife. You can ask that if she doesn’t like what you’re making, she waits until after you’re done, but that’s pretty much it. With your son, however? If you ask me, from now on ALL food that requires a tool to prepare that isn’t easily cleaned is gluten free! (Bread maker, toaster, etc). Eating gluten when you’re celiac can LITERALLY cause cancer later in life. Cross contamination is huge-your wife doesn’t seem to get this. Can you try cooking yours & your sons meal gf, & only have two meals made a day? "
afqw94,"NTA. If you're not happy in this relationship, it's better to end it than to stick it out and suffer. She is an adult and needs to be able to care for herself or get professional care."
afqxk0,"ESH 

This whole situation is immature. Wtf reason was there for a fight between you and jamal? The fact that you showed up is absurd. What did you have to prove? And what did he? The fact that he wanted to fight to what prove his masculinity or that he's mad that you told someone to stop a behavior that was making him self harm?

And btw your ex gf is not a ""nice and thoughtful"" person if she was cheating with her best friend's boyfriend. There's no fucking excuse for that. She sucks most of all."
afrb1e,NTA. Your MIL is one of those mothers who typically end up being the reason for their child’s unhappiness. Your husband is pretty lucky you had the guns to stick around through her nonsense. The upside here is no one lives forever.
afrgro,"NTA


If you can't distinguish between someone using it toward another person derogatively or commenting that the word was used, you have no business judging decency."
afrp3n,"YTA - but only because you seem to be taking this route for things to be easier for you with little consideration of your mom, and none of your sister having to live with this secret. "
afrsu0,"YTA for giving two shits if she's legit depressed not, and two times the asshole for catfishing her to try and trap her. Someone else attention whoring doesn't affect you or cheapen your personal struggle with depression at all. Maybe she sucks and is lying, impossible to say based on what you wrote here, but you suck so hard for getting into it like this. Honestly what did you even gain?"
afru7c,NTA. Mental illness isn’t an excuse for toxic behaviour. That girl is toxic. 
afrym6,"NTA your reaction is justified. But you need to consider if you are going to be staying with your bf. Sounds to me like a cover up for his true feelings. Possibly gaslighting you or just making you think you're the one at fault to steer you away from finding out his intentions. Idk. My opinion, you should stay away from him. 
"
afs2v5,NTA. If there were “plenty of available seats” she could go find another one. 
afsboy,"NTA, that’s disgusting and your husband knows it."
afscsy,NTA- it sounds like a bit of a miscommunication. But your wife is probably scared. I’d tell her you’re sorry about misunderstanding her and that you’re getting there as fast as you can! 
afsi1y,"advice from a kid of very religious parents who finally moved out last year: yelling doesn’t help, having a conversation at the right time with facts/reasons you don’t want to participate in their activities is a much better way to go. If that doesn’t work, try to see church as an experience to learn something about religion, even though you don’t follow it. If you pretend it’s a learning experience it’s easier to get through. "
afsj16,">Jim and Bob were poking her breasts and ass and she felt a little uncomfortable

First red flag.

>I had, more or less, come to the conclusion that Jim didn't like me very much, I talked to Ann about this and she kinda confirmed this.

Second red flag.

>after I went to get my coat, they had talked about me (he had basically said that I seemed a bit insensitive)

Third red flag.

>after the argument over alcohol he had encouraged her to break up with me

Fourth red flag.

Fuck that guy. I say stand your ground here. NTA."
afsks5,"NTA, and please don't for a second think that you are the A. Having a parent that treats you in that manner is not fair on you and must be so difficult to deal with. You deserve support, respect, and love. If you can, try and find someone to speak to in your local area (through NHS). But most of all, look after yourself OP and good luck with the job!"
afslk9,"No, you would not, she has a right to know"
afsn8r,"NTA but you are acting like one. I know how it feels op, just tell her and one of two things will happen.

She will distance herself from you and give you the space you need allowing you to move on.

Or

She may have feelings for you too and everyone wins "
afsoi5,"NTA. Your parents are enabling his shitty behaviour and they have absolutely no right to expect you to do the same. By trying to force a relationship despite his harmful behaviour, they are prioritising their feelings and your brother over you. If he isn't going to sort himself out, you should absolutely distance yourself from his toxic attitude and behaviour."
afsov0,"NTA fucked up of them to literally spring the idea of sex onto you. Would you have said yes if they’d brought it up in the living room, while still clothed? If the answer is probably not then you’ve been seriously manipulated. They sound like major assholes."
afswer,"NTA, you're looking out for her. Make it clear that its not your friendship that youre stopping , just the unhealthy eating."
afswhw,"NAH, its not unreasonable to ask to pay some of it, considering that you both use it. Your boyfriend made a bit of a mistake, but everyone does that.

Just remember not to act entitled to his money, it was still ultimately your choice to allow him to use the car. If he says no, then thats that. If he says yes, remember that he may begin feeling entitled for more of the cars responsibilities, meaning he may begin viewing it as part of his own."
afsx6p,"Are you joking?! If my gf was having “snuggle” parties and cuddling other guys behind my back, she’d be gone in a second. YTA, YTA, YTA, YTA. Absolutely mind blown by how people this is acceptable, he should run a mile. "
afsy54,NTA. Driving whilst high is incredibly irresponsible. You're not being hypocritical unless you drive when high.
afsy7a,"YTA, not because you left the game and he lost because it doesn’t matter what so ever, but because there is absolutely no reason to act harshly towards a friend because of kills in Minecraft. You let it matter so much in your life that you let your emotions get out of hand, so stop doing that."
aft0qt,YTA. He pays rent. It a dick move to simply say because my GF does this yours should too. Then on top of that they did listen to you with her being there only 3 days a week. But you still feel the need to tell them she can only be there on the days you approve of? It sounds to me you can’t handle a roommate. Have you even tried being friendly towards her? It would make things less awkward for you and your roommate. 
aft5yp,"NTA, LDR are hard and it's sad but relationships have to either be made of stone or they'll fall apart if it is no longer convenient. Speaking daily could help but it doesn't sound like he's going to indicate time just for you without the game.

Hate to say it but this could be the beginning of the end.

Easy test, dont call him for a couple days and see if he calls you. As in, force him to call your mobile if he even does call. That way you'll get a result, either you'll have his full attention on a call or you know he's not going to put in the effort for you."
aft69x,"NTA, you stood up for your friends and sought out the truth when he was acting crazy. He could've easily made more threats twordes you, so you're not the asshole for bailing, it was what's best for your safety and sanity. "
aftgrf,"Wow, couldn't be fucked reading all that. 

If he's a good friend he should understand. 

NAH"
aftj6f,SHP? Where can you get married at 17?
aftxjl,"ESH. 

YTA for saying ugly people should be nicer. Someone ugly saying something rude is equally as rude as someone attractive saying something rude. Probably shouldn’t let it slide just because an attractive person is saying it. Everyone should do their best to be a good person.

Your friend is rude for hinging on to this one point and essentially ignoring that a fat tomato tried to sexually assault you several times. I’m sorry you had to go through that. That guy sucks. If he was handsome though, he should still suck.

Nothing wrong with having preferences for what you’re attracted to. There is something wrong with giving people a moral upper-hand by suggesting that ugly people should be nicer."
aftxmq,"NTA. The friend zone does not exist and you don’t owe him shit. You were friends, and it’s not your job to babysit him through his crush. 

It was up to him to ask you out if he felt this way, and he waited a long time to tell you how he felt. If he can’t handle that, he should have left you alone.

Edit: I also find it weird and creepy that he moved in with you, knowing he felt that way and you had no idea."
aftygc,"NTA. It is your house, and they should be respectful to you. I understand your bf social needs. You should be able to decide freely and without problems if you want to play or not. But definitely the friends should not do these kind of jokes. Personally, I think your bf (or last resort you) should tell the friends to keep these kind of comments to themselves when they do them. You don't like them, and if they continue there won't be any more Sunday game nights. Is about respect "
afucrw,"YTA. He was using words and you made it physical. You also don't know if you annoyed him as much as he annoyed you, but when you annoyed him he didn't hit you."
afurnp,NTA. They are your things after all.
afuvgh,"NTA. Pets should never be kept outdoors, especially in Winter. I had Guinea Pigs indoors and as long as they’re cleaned every 3 days or so, they don’t smell. Also, you could make sure you use things to make the room smell cleaner. "
afuxl9,"NTA having a job where you’re responsible for chasing up your own pay is the worst, if you have the luxury of choice in your clients then you’ve absolutely earned the right to fire an inconsiderate one. Stress off your shoulders, more power to you :) "
afvbja,"NTA. Do not, under any circumstances give up any of your time with your son. It's important for you two to bond, you're entitled to have that time with him, and (disclaimer, I am not a lawyer) I believe she can try and fuck you over later on because she will have more custody."
afvj8t,"NTA 8am is annoying, but reasonable, esp. Given that he is a landlord, unfortunately I think it comes with the job
Unless you lock yourself out regularly, in that case , get yo shit together "
afvqlc,"NAH. 

They have a right to date, and you have a right to be hurt and want to distance yourself from the situation.  "
afw0tq,"NTA she needs help but if she doesn't want it no forcing it.  Sucks, and it's really gonna suck when she dies and you/family have to clean it."
afw3gt,NTA and you know it.
afwhtk,"YTA. the main purpose of having a ""fuck buddy"" is to, well, fuck without any commitment or attachment. If this is what you guys are, well then I dont really see why the guy should have any obligation to stick with you and only you. It seems like you got attached to this guy."
afwqma,"YTA. If you were a wheelchair user, or had a pram, you'd have a right to be more annoyed. But you could obviously get past them, and you could have seen they were upset and decided that your getting to voice your anger was less important than whatever they were going through."
afww8h,NTA. They were stealing time and taking breaks in non break areas. Don’t guilt yourself over it cause you did the right thing and certainly don’t make yourself believe your job is any less difficult than their job just cause their job is more physical.
afxf0y,NTA. End this relationship. It’s not healthy for you. This is not acceptable behavior. 
afxjol,NTA in my opinion. I believe Hulu offers more screens if you pay a little more (so does Netflix) so I would explain to your roommate/friend (face to face) about your feelings and offer to expand the monthly rate for three screens if he chips in for his sister's portion. 
afxnr7,"YTA. Jebus, ***yes***... you were an asshole to make light of suicide. Even if it was a meme -- *though I've never heard of it* -- there are lots of memes that are not appropriate for conversation

Did you really expect that anyone would say you were not the asshole here?"
afxoa5,"I don't think it's too late to discuss it with them. There's a good chance they don't even know their dog behaves this way when they're gone. If they do, NTA. If they don't, NAH until further action."
afy72i,"ESH. You have no right to decide what he does with his money, unless he owes YOU money. 

On the other hand, he’s an asshole too for not taking responsibility and repaying a debt. "
afyaqs,"NTA

> He said “in the real world” people will be making comments about my body all the time and I need to learn how to deal with it and not expect him to coddle me

So his point is ""how dare you expect your lover to treat you differently than random strangers?"" 

While it's best if you're understanding of genuine slipups (I could see it being difficult to remember sometimes), it sounds to me like he's simply unwilling to meet you halfway here. Is that the precedent you want?"
afydsy,"YTA. Just because she lived a comfortable (or even entitled) lifestyle before the disaster, doesn't mean she can't be upset too. She, just like everyone else, lost her home and her reaction seems completely normal. Your reaction was deliberate, completely uncalled for, and inappropriate."
afypm0,"NTA

clip away. Maybe pull up some supporting stuff online showing your BF that you're not harming the cat in anyway. Might even be helpful to watch a video or two with him to ensure you know the best way to do it without harming the cat for that matter.

but if you declaw the cats, you're a giant asshole. So don't do that."
afyssi,"She just literally told you she doesn’t want to date you, which translates to, look for someone else. NTA just TI."
afyujt,YTA. Don't bring up someone's weight uninvited. Common courtesy.
afyxt5,"NTA, the store should have their stuff labeled right.


Now if you changed the labels you'd be having an issue. "
afyxy7,"Yeah kinda YTA. You can expect him to respect your stuff but it's a ""shared"" desk. He has to work there too. If hes making messes intentionally to bother you thats one thing but calling him out because he is not as organized as you is a dick move. If you can't handle your stuff being moved a bit, you need to not work in a shared space. "
afyze5,"YTA. Yes, you would be the asshole for “testing” your boyfriend. Be a grown up and have a conversation with him. Tell him immediately that this person contacted you. Tell him how it made you feel and why it made you feel that way. You’ll know much more from how he responds to a mature conversation than you will from your experiment. "
afz00q,"YTA if you keep being ""friends"" with her. It seems like your relationship has run its course, and talking bad about her behind her back makes you look bad too, even if the people listening agree. 

Start distancing yourself from her."
afz91n,YTA. Stop stringing her along you selfish prick. Stop seeing her 
afzbg3,NTA Your SO needs to stop being so sensitive.
afzcwx,"ESH. He was being an ass for wasting your time. You were just being salty until you used the words ""fuck off"" in your exchange, at which point you surpassed the asshole threshold."
afzj45,"NTA, but I really don't recommend it. It would be like trying to show my Southern Baptist family the movie Zeitgeist; it would go over like a lead balloon. Most likely, they'll end up bombarding your inbox with ""we're praying for you""-type messages.

Cult members rarely have wake-up calls, even when presented with hard core facts. They won't believe it because they can't, they're so deep into it. You'll likely be branded as a pagan/liar, and some may even go after you if they don't shun you outright. "
afzjw7,"NTA.  I was tempted to ESH this one.  I was ready to point the finger and say, do you pay rent? do you pay for your food? etc.  But I realized, they are the parents. They chose to have kids and they chose to do this:

""she went on a rant on how god is gonna punish me for pressuring her ...""

AND...

""her and my stepdad got matching tattoo worth about $50-$100 each""

These are not the actions of someone who plans to pay their debt. Parents don't get a free pass.  NTA for you!"
afzk6g,"NTA. The show exploit emotions for ratings so they are the assholes. The stories are insanely cringy as well and seem rehearsed. Almost like the producers will ask them about their sob story first. Reddit forums though, some subs are designed for support so i don't know what else you would expect there. "
afzqw1,"NTA. But a lot of what you said doesn't make sense. I don't understand how you don't speak the same language as your parents? I'm assuming they spoke Korean at home when you were growing up? And it's wildly inappropriate for a school to have called an minor sibling to help with a younger sibling, rather than calling they parents, regardless of the language barrier. Your parents should not be relying on their children for all their translating needs. I don't think it's unreasonable for you to all your older siblings to help, especially since you're still recovering from a concussion. Calmly explain to your father that you can't help, especially when he is yelling at you. He's an adult and has obviously been living in the US for 20-ish years. He needs to be handling this kind of thing himself."
afzy6j,"You're not the asshole, but you're definitely making it harder than it has to be.

Make a choice and stick to it: You either eat with your roommates and share a bill, or you don't at all. Don't give them this wishy-washy ""wellllllllll if things work around MY schedule MAYBE I'll go to the market and contribute"" BS.

No one wants to interpret your schedule or life plans, they have enough going on. Either be on your own food-wise completely, and never touch the communal stuff, or be a part of the group. If month-to-month you're making a headache for everyone by not being definitive about your plans, then yes YTA."
ag0fa0,NTA. It's been almost a decade. The sheer presumptuousness of contacting you out of the blue and just assuming you'd want to have them over as a guest is staggering. Honestly I'd be suspicious that they were just after a place to stay rather than genuinely wanting to rekindle a friendship.
ag0ph2,"NTA. It's okay that you aren't blinded by love. Some babies just aren't adorable, and that's okay. They are still worthwhile human beings. They might be more smart or funny or affectionate or curious instead. You're an asshole if you tell the nephew or his parents you think he's an ugly kid, but otherwise, just give the kid some time to grow into his face. And if he ends up an ugly man, that's okay too. You can love him even if he's ugly."
ag0wak,[deleted]
ag0xmn,"ESH. She assumed, without asking, that you made a meal without considering her gluten intolerance, when she knows that you take particular care of everyone’s dietary restrictions/ preferences in the house (and have for many years). You, however, seriously overreacted. Now you’re both acting immature by refusing to talk out the incident. "
ag0zmo,"NTA - fuck that guy. Your SO is upset because she's lost her grandfather, give her time.

Edit: although, what could be better than a black person going to a racist's funeral? At least you'll know he's been buried."
ag148o,[deleted]
ag19z3,Nta you are 100% correct. He has no rights to your body and you have no obligation to be giving him any kind of sexual favours if you don’t want to. And if this is his way of getting one from you he sounds like a terrible person. 
ag1c7s,"NTA for wanting to. Pressure like that can bring out the worst in anyone, but it's not a reason to heap abuse on a friend doing a big favor. It's time to have a heart-to-heart. Just tell her you understand she's under tremendous pressure, but you need her to be respectful towards you and not use you to take out her frustrations. If she can't have a reasonable conversation about things without blowing up, then it's time to pack it up and head home. Give her the chance to make amends, and if she does let it go...we all suck sometimes."
ag1clb,"You need to end this relationship.  Now.  If he is this controlling now, he will only get worse.   He is putting you down, belittling you, and disrespecting you.  If this is an isolated incident, look him dead in the eyes and say, ""Do not ever do anything like that again.""  However, if there have been similar belittling episodes, pack your bags one more time and get out."
ag1eqm,"NTA

Really the only way to get things fixed in an apartment complex is to antagonize the front office staff.  If you don't yell and make a scene in front of prospective renters your stuff will not get fixed.

The coating in our tub was peeling off.  I asked nicely for a few weeks for them to send someone out to fix it.  Of course the people scheduled never showed up.  Then I went back and tried to schedule again.

The guy showed up a week or so later at 6:00 pm (6 hours late) while I was making dinner.  We were told we had to leave and take our cats for 4 hours.  That obviously wasn't possible (at no point prior were we told that the cats had to go and the front office even said we could stay there while they worked) so we sent him away and I called called again the next morning when the office opened.

They said there would be a $30 charge to reschedule and I lost it.  They put a manager on, waived the fee, and told me someone would be out the next day before noon.

As per the usual, they weren't there on time (it was after 1:00 at this point).  My wife went up to the front office to complain.  She made a huge scene in front of people who were considering signing lease so they offered us money off rent and got the contractors out at 2:30.

"
ag1fzw,"NTA - I don't know why she's being so awful to you. I recommend talking to her about your feelings and how she made you upset. Depending on how she responds, I'd do a lot of thinking on if this marriage is worth it."
ag1ige,ESH. You're both acting incredibly immature and are gonna keep stalling at this place in your relationship until you BOTH grow up. 
ag1knx,"NTA

She cheated and went so far as to let you take her on vacation and she was shooting some guy tit shots while you paid for her room and board. 

You need to get checked for STDs.  She may have given you any number of nasty dick infections.  "
ag1vg2,"YTA

Yes, you would be the asshole for leading someone on for six months. "
ag21xn,"ESH, you both had an agreement, and she violated it, but I think you over reacted to the situation. A FWB situation will rarely ever remain a secret."
ag273y,Not the asshole but you shouldn’t let that kill your friendship. Just act like it never happened. 
ag295l,"Eh, I'm going to say NTA since you didn't actually do anything, and you are just feeling kind of upset. I had a similar situation as the youngest sibling when my much older siblings started having kids, and suddenly everything was about the grandkids. That's part of growing up and it sucks, but I think the important thing is you recognize these feelings of annoyance and jealousy and find a way to move on. And it sounds like you have, so NTA.  "
ag2ced,"If this isn't a shit post, I'd say NTA just uneducated on pregnant bodies. You aren't going to hurt the baby even if your hung like John Holmes. "
ag2drx,"YTA. Did i misinterpret or did you use suicide as an excuse to get away from this girl instesd of not being a coward and honestly communicating your feelings.

God of course someone thats into you will be even more worried and caring if your suicidal. What a shitty way of trying to distance from someone. Worse than ghosting. Really pathetic in my opinion if i understood it correctly."
ag2eok,NTA because you voiced your concerns over people you care about but all you can do now is leave it be. It's Jack's choice.
ag2ex8,"So you're asking if you're an asshole for habitually stiffing people on tips just because you ""don't think much of it,"" and also assuming ""foreign"" people are going to spit in your food at a higher rate than native English speakers? 

Uh, yeah, this seems like a pretty clear YTA.

clarification edit: OP is talking about not tipping when they physically go to the restaurant to grab food and take it home. No drivers or servers are being stiffed in this scenario. My bad!

The thing about being afraid that people who aren't speaking English are talking about you  is still questionable."
ag2h25,"NTA. He won't succeed in court, in fact he is most likely to still have to pay child support (even without any visitation rights). Keep standing your ground, help your sister to follow suit. Try to keep a record of what abusive/toxic behavior he shows and give that to your lawyer. Try to summarize everything you've experienced with him in notes so you don't forget anything in the hearing. I hope that everything goes well. "
ag2lml,"NAH. I mean this in a supportive way, but you might need to seek some help dealing with these issues. You're not an asshole here, because you feel what you feel, but you will only find yourself in this situation again and possibly lose another romantic partner if you don't find a way to work through your issues."
ag2ppx,"NTA It seems that the kid might have personal problems and they are causing this behavior. Bad parenting maybe. I would say to punch him next time, but that would not be wise."

ag36pv,"NAH. 


She's not an asshole for being upset because it must be an incredibly shitty experience.

If I was laid up in bed I would definitely expect my husband to spend some time with me, but not 12 hours a day of doing nothing. It's unrealistic. "
ag375x,"I mean, NTA I guess, but why are you still with this person if she cheated on you + still expresses a desire to keep in touch with the person she cheated with?

Break it off, OP."
ag38dz,"YTA. She shared something personal -- *as one does with one's romantic partner* -- and you called her ""disgusting"". See that line behind you? That was the YTA line you just crossed.

Apologize."
ag3jm7,"NTA, that's extremely annoying of her. You should try talking to her though, before it gets to you."
ag3pqx,"YTA Now correct me if I’m wrong but it isn’t like his name is tattooed on her back. It’s just a flower. Pretty simple nothing to be worried about.

ag4os8,"NTA I’d they’re thinking it is ok for having you sleep on the couch.  That being said, you’d probably be responsible for a bit more of the lodging, ie if they have a 7 bedroom, the others couples would split the cost of the room, while you would be responsible for your room.  No different than if you all got your own hotel rooms.  The other costs should be split equally.  That’s just my opinion, "

NAH."
ag4us0,"NAH 

That’s quite a mental image.  A ton of people planning their wild Vegas trip - ensuring a proper mass is involved.  "
ag4wen,"You’re definitely NTA, but you need to establish expectations in the relationship. If you feel uncomfortable with him commenting flirty things to other women, tell him. That’s a perfectly good boundary to set. I wouldn’t worry about the mix-up considering the “yes”. If he makes a big deal out of it, it’s because he wants to. Not because you did something wrong. "
ag4wuj,I honestly wonder how people like you get through life. YTA.

Just because you work there doesn't mean he has to right to talk to you like that. I just don't get how people don't understand this."
ag50b0,"NTA

I'm a teacher. I'd never get mad about something like that. You have to choose your battles as a teacher and he chose unwisely. 

Unless you did this as a way to intentionally disrupt class you're NTA for sure."
ag565c,"NAH, I used to be a person of colour living in an extremely white area of a city. I understand how it feels to feel like an alien where you live, especially where the culture may be different to yours and you may find it hard to integrate into theirs. But if you think its racist, good on you for pointing it out. "
ag5asf,"NTA, you’re allowed to date who you want. If you don’t see a future with her, why waste your (and her) time? "
ag5c7m,"NTA, but your boyfriends needs to take control here. She's stalking him, after all. Maybe she'll listen, maybe she won't, but if it comes from you, she almost definitely won't listen. "
ag5nkn,"Idk.  I kind of get why OP might feel a bit jealous.  The actions that he took will determine whether or not he is the asshole, but just as a premise, concerts are definitely bonding experiences.  You are listening to music that you enjoy being played live, and if you go with someone, you are going with them usually under the premise that you both are fans of the artist.  When that artist is playing / performing and you are vibing to it, and someone is doing that with your girlfriend and it’s not you, I think it is human nature to at least feel jealousy.

Now that being said, if you trust someone, then I think that you should rest easy in that trust and that they wouldn’t do something to jeopardize the relationship.  The fact that she’s known this dude for only 4 months is a little weird, but hopefully 8 years of trust would supersede that.

I’ll just say this.  I would never tell my girlfriend not to do this, but I would never have to.  She would, on her own, feel weird going to a concert with someone of the opposite sex she’s only known for 4 months.  Would she go to a concert without me?  Absolutely.  With a girl friend, or a mixed group of people?  Definitely.  But would should go one on one in this situation?  I don’t think she would.  I think she would feel uncomfortable doing something like that because, in my opinion, the implications of doing it are fairly obvious.  Again, I’d never stop her, and I think a lot of reddit will give you the standard “if you don’t trust them then YTA” answer as if everything happens in a vacuum.  But the implications of going to a concert with a person of the opposite gender that you’ve only known for 4 months are definitely enough to at least cause OP to feel a little jealous.

Again, how you acted on that feeling will determine whether or not YTA.  But it doesn’t sound like you’ve done anything yet.  Correct me if I’m wrong, but it sounds like you had a feeling, and you are introspective and analytical enough to question where the feeling came from, whether it’s valid, and if you are in the wrong for feeling it.

My official answer:  if you trust your gf now, then continue to trust her.  That being said, the premise of what she did, at face value, is something that is reasonable enough to have a feeling over.  It doesn’t mean anything on its own.  Do not build a mountain out of a molehill.  If this new friend of hers is someone she genuinely bonds with over things that she doesn’t bond with anyone else with, then you shouldn’t deprive her of that over jealousy.  No one person is ever 100% enough for anyone, and that’s ok.  "
ag5rl8,"NTA , I feel they should have told you that before...if they weren't planning to support you, you could start saving long ago. 

I'm sorry Op. You will have to do an extra effort, but you can do it. "
ag5ydx,"NTA. It's your professional reputation on the line and they have no business trying to guilt and pressure you into doing something. Worst case scenario and your cousin has a total freakout, or says something inadvertently racist, they will suffer zero consequences, so it's very easy for them to sit on the sidelines and tell you what they think you have to do. You need to look after yourself first and foremost when it comes to matters like this, because if the shit hits the fan it could affect the rest of your professional career."
ag638u,NTA- He’s pretending to read people’s books so they actually read his and provide him with legitimate feedback. He’s likely trying to game the algorithms on Wattpad to get traction for his book. 
ag647z,"Idk,
From the description your NTA.
But that's not to say that this entire scenario wasn't kinda annoying to read. "
ag6ewo,"NTA. A relationship that constantly wears you down isn't healthy, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. The last few lines, in which you said she has been fangirling about the new person she had...made clear that all she wanted was someone who would *constantly* reassure her with soft words. The moment you stopped, she no longer appreciated what you did for her.

You tried your best. Everyone has a breaking point."
ag6h2x,NTA.  The person you talked to is paid to make it hard for you to cancel.  You have to be firm or they walk over you.
ag6ugu,"Oh most definitely NTA. She strung you along just to lead you on for this long? You were gonna crack sooner or later, and you could've done so much worse to her. Not everything works out. Don't worry about it too much."
ag6up2,"NTA, you seem to have PTSD from your past and seeing your step brother basically fully resembling your ""dad"" who sexually harassed you is something that can trigger this bad. You're not the asshole for being human."
ag6ww8,"NTA, but I would explore *why* you find him so hard to deal with.

Absolutely not saying you need to renew a relationship with him in any way, but it sounds like there is deep, deep anger and resentment there and it might be good to get some help sorting through it.  The opposite of love isn't hate, it's apathy. But your post reads like you haven't reached that point yet and you still have very hard feelings. Apologies if i'm overstepping. 

Your parents enabled his behaviour? What did your mother have to say when she told you what he said?

ag77yk,"YTA,  soon you'll be 18. An adult.  It will be up to you whether or not you continue to live with your father and your new sister.

ag7mm0,"You betrayed her trust, do you really have to ask?"
ag7si6,"NTA.

I mean, you weren’t being a good friend to him, but he was being a massive jerk. I don’t think telling her the truth makes you an asshole. Cheating is a shit move. He clearly didn’t care until he was caught."
ag84ed,"YTA. She is not obligated to forgive him. You may believe he has paid his dues to society, but that's only an opinion on the matter."
ag851q,"NAH. He might compartmentalize your sacrifice as towards the success of your relationship, as it helps him perform better at his job which he uses to help support your life together. Then in his brain your request was for leisure, when he felt he was deserving of some leisure time, too. This was all probably subconscious. 

You just need to be honest and have a conversation. Maybe compromise a little bit on how often you give each other rides and set up some rules for what the expectations you have of each other are. This is a pretty minor issue, you just need to talk about it calmly. Don't be mean or accusatory and it should be pretty simple. "
ag85tk,"SHP. But if not, as long as you didn't do anything to hurt him NTA. You can't control other people's mental health and if they want you as a friend they need to not be assholes"
ag8iqs,"NAH.  You wanted to do your thing, your fiance wanted to do another thing, it happens.  Personally if I had the choice between a 20 minute work out and 20 minutes before my SO passes out, it wouldn't even be a choice. "

Committing illegal vandalism is never a good way to solve your problem.   Find a way to leave the situation.  Document what is happening and pursue legal options.  (Several things he is doing \*are\* illegal if they can be proven.)

ag8u3a,"ESH. If you can get into **3 hours** of arguing over such a small matter, then I think eating left-overs is the least issue in your relationship. "
ag8xan,"NTA!  Anyone who chooses to care for a child has to put that child's best interests first. Doesn't matter if your sperm/egg helped create her or not.  This ""father"" is not a parent, he is a playdate. You get to do all the work she he can be her friend. It's going to lead to some very confusing teenage years and her feelings about men are going to be  so skewed that she'll need therapy.

Your husband is also in the wrong.  I can't condone fraud and nor should you be forced to.  He is actively involving you in breaking the law. 

I wish I had an easy answer for you but I don't.   Perhaps draft a parenting plan (loads online) and if the father won't commit to it then cut him off until he will. Or restrict his access to in your home?  Or tell him if he doesn't take parenting classes and see a therapist about his messed up life and relationship with his daughter that he can't see her anymore?

I hope it gets better for you, but mostly for her, poor girl. "
ag94i4,NTA at all you have done your best for him
ag97gq,"NTA your boyfriend is a dick. You need to talk to him about it and say that it is not okay, that you need your sleep. If he refuses to be more considerate, then kick him to the curb and find someone better. "

ag9m3r,"NAH. I get where you are at. The first on is funny, the second one perhaps poorly judged. The waiter, trying to lighten the mood on a busy shift, ok that's understandable. Not moving on and giving you the stink eye, that's a bit shitty."
ag9pca,NTA. This women is using the fuck out of you and you’re just taking it. Move out as soon as you can. 
ag9qh3,"NTA, but this isn't going to go anywhere good.

If your two friends only see your guy friend as an object to fight over, instead of a human being with his own interests and feelings, then your best friendship is going to be pretty rocky for the forseeable future.  And it's only going to get worse if he's enjoying the attention enough to be snuggling with them both.  

It might be best to distance yourself until he picks one or finds another GF."
ag9vy2,"NTA, if you already have approved time off and your coworker (sister) has told the boss she'd work that day, your job here is done. "
aga5ae,"So... wait... what?

Your ex ""found"" a pen and gave it to your girlfriend to give to you and tell you it's from your ex. But somehow it's actually a gift from your girlfriend's best friend, and you know this, your girlfriend knows this, and her best friend knows this.

So your ex stole the pen from your girlfriend's best friend? Or your ex did find the pen and your girlfriend and her best friend are lying? None of this makes any sense."
agab17,"NTA.

In this situation, it's not even about whether you're being an asshole or not. You're not really given much of a choice here. If you can't move out on your flatmates schedule, and you can't afford to stay longer, that's not your fault. He's the one that made these plans on his own without you. He can't expect you to bend over backwards for him. Do what you need to do to."
agabx5,"NTA you're completely justified imo. Anti vaxxers put any immunocomprimised people at risk, not just themselves. And to extend it to their kids makes me sick. I'm so glad I don't know anyone who thinks this way, but I know they're out there. Hopefully you taking this step might make them think a bit more. Well done op for being the strong one and taking a stand. "
agahhk,"YTA because of this: 

>I was annoyed about this and told her that she should have told me this in the first place.

She was molested. Many, many people who were molested are not comfortable taking about the details of what they went through. It can take a very long time to build up the kind of trust and comfort needed to share that with someone."

agao4z,I'd dump her for just for pulling that stunt... that'd not funny at all.
agaqtw,"NTA. Your mother should not have shared the login with her BF, and he definitely should not have shared it onward. Change your information. I'd do the same."
agas2r,"YTA. I'm getting a real *stalker-y* vibe here. Despite her telling you that you needed to back off the texting -- *code for STOPPING ALTOGETHER* -- you continued to text her. Then you continued the heavy press. She told you that you were coming on too strong and you still continued. Dude, time to back off, stop all contact, and move on.

*EDIT: grammar*"
agb9en,"40% of your grade resting on finding sponsors during your break, with no other option (since it's full)... That's really fucked up.

agba3m,"YTA. I dont know how old you are, but you sound very young. You'd be baiting him. Thats very immature. Talking goes a long way. "
agbcjn,"Definitely a tough spot you were in, but YTA. All that stuff she said is on police body cam and probably in the report, and that's all tied to his name. That could really come back to haunt him. This is why you record after an accident. Plus dude you need to get away from her, she sounds like bad people, and what if she gets pissed at you and accuses you of rape or something. "
agbemp,"If they're actually getting 15 bucks an hour, no.  But are they actually getting 15 bucks an hour, or are they getting 3 bucks an hour with the understanding that their employer will make up the difference if it's not made up in tips?  Because in the latter situation the servers that don't make up the difference in tips generally get fired."
agbglu,"NTA-you’re letting her borrow your car for free until she can buy her own. Owning two cars isn’t an asshole thing, unless you were just going to hoard them. IMO, maybe buy the second one and offer to sell it to her once she has the money, but don’t gift the car and assume payback. Loaning large value items is a recipe for disaster in most cases. "
agbi7m,"NTA. Bipolar sufferer here. 

Don't ever let yourself become unwell for someone else. Do what you have to for you. 

As for being mean to you - whilst I'm hardly perfect or the model of perfect wellness with my own condition, bipolar is not an excuse for her behaviour. "
agbknx,"NAH, people are cute.

agcged,"nta. and frankly your boyfriend needs to step up and step in. this is his mother. if you feel you can, it’d be nice if you could hang out with her while she’s bedridden. but you shouldn’t be feeling all this pressure, and you definitely shouldn’t be feeling it alone."
agci61,"NTA. Ignoring the furry stuff, this is both sexual harassment and hugely inappropriate. You should ask your supervisor to tell her to cut it out.

Like, a reasonable person would not show porn (illustrated or otherwise) to a coworker. Clearly she doesn't understand boundaries."
agckb4,"ESH. Everyone thinks they’re doing the best for the kids, but no one’s actually talking to each other, with the result that everyone’s working at cross purposes. 

While I agree with the scientific approach recommended by the doctor, by just ignoring the impact of the mother, the kids continue to be hurt as well as learning antiscientific drivel. I think the father should talk to his lawyer and get the custody agreement modified so that the mother is barred from antiscientific nonsense that is clearly hurting the child. "
agcmji,"YTA but not for not being attracted to her. The problem is you’ve stayed in a relationship for six months when you know you’re not compatible. She’s noticed there’s a problem, and rather than be honest, you write it off to just being tired. If your sex drives are so mismatched and you’re not attracted to her sexually, why is she your girlfriend? You care for her, but you can care for her in a platonic way, which seems to be what you want. Be honest and cut the poor girl loose. 

To clarify: asshole for misleading, not for lack of boners. "
agcs5p,"NTA

she’s not your responsibility to take care of or to help just because you had the same parent. 


Just because it might “be good for her mental state” doesn’t mean it’s your responsibility to provide that. You have your own life to live and if you feel this way about her, she’s never earned anything from you. 

I mean you don’t owe every person with mental problems your time right? Why would you owe any to your estranged sister?"
agcve7,"NTA at all! If you don’t want to be in that relationship, you’re in no way obligated to. You could break up with him for something way less and you still would be valid... it’s your choice. Also, he sounds really immature for treating you that way before and after you broke up. I don’t think he’s worth you time. "
agd3xg,YTA because you should have grown a pair and politely said no thank you. 
agd4jt,"NTA. Not at all. If anything, more kudos to you for wanting to further your education while being a single parent. I hope the best for you."
agd5m5,"YWBTA If you made a huge deal out of it and sent a passive aggressive text to everyone. Just start telling people NO when they ask. Use the excuse you're too busy if you want. Just say No.

agdj3p,"NTA. I totally agree that it’s not an appropriate way to memorialise a friend given the circumstances of his passing and your ‘friends’ were incredibly disrespectful when you raised concerns. They are the assholes, not you."

Your parents sound like they have problems. You absolutely should be contributing to the household chores, but that doesn't mean you should have to do all the cleaning. You don't have kids purely to have someone to clean the house, wtf is wrong with them?"
agdkvu,NTA. Your girlfriend must remember that your life does not revolve around her. She's being very introspective here; you have other obligations essential to your own self improvement that you must fulfill. She must understand this.
agdmb3,"So basically, you hung out with her because you wished you could do her and then when that desire goes away you dump her? What a great friend. If she never had a personality in your opinion why were you being a fake friend to her all that time?"

Having a woman you barely know, and who has a 'Rocky relationship with him is not a woman you want alone with your daughter. 

He's not in the wrong necessarily for asking, but is definitely an asshole for putting you in that position. Your daughter should never have to be alone with someone you're not comfortable with. "
agdw4q,"NTA - he intentionally withheld the fact he was underage. Between that and kissing and telling, this guy is shaping up to be a real douche. "
agdyel,"Like you wrote, she was looking forward to seeing it TOGETHER. Since there's not a lot you two can actually do together because of the time difference, sometimes stupid little things like watching a show together for the first time really really means a lot. This sounds like my husband and me. We watch shows together and if I know he's watched it already it is not as interesting. I think it's a lot with witnessing the reaction he has to certain scenes. Just don't do it again or don't tell her if you must watch it without her, although that would be YTA situation. "
age1i5,"NAH. You didn't laugh out loud. You had a brief mental picture, which was highly inaccurate, but you didn't react openly. Next time though... be a bit more cognizant of the context and watch your reactions. A smile was highly inappropriate considering the subject matter.

BTW... ""survival sex"" is the unfortunate act that some people feel they have to have with an abuser (or person in power of them) in order to survive a situation. For example, a female prisoner who is forced to have ""survival sex"" with a prison guard. ""Survival sex"" is also commonly known as ***rape***."
age3ky,"NTA

She’s trying to play it both ways- you’re not exclusive but you were together and you broke up but she still wants to talk. What does she want? The world may never know. 

You are never under an obligation to have a friendship with an ex. "
age8pg,"I didn't say I was an atheist directly, I just asked my aunt if I could skip the handholding and praying part. I didn't just say ""oh I'm an atheist I don't want to do this"""
agehjv,"YTA.  Although asshole is a little strong of a word here. Asking questions is one thing, but making jokes... That's distracting and unnecessary. The focus should be on the teacher, not you. If you need clarification, definitely ask during class. For those other questions you admit are a bit tangential or off topic, I would wait until after class or during office hours. And save the jokes for a more appropriate forum. "
ageqsw,"Everyone sucks here

You’re right but it wasn’t wise to say in front of the persons friend."

This is CLEARLY a scam. Being from the wrong email address is clearly a scam. Lol at fronting my boss $1500 even if it was real. The company is not responsible for stupid purchases that employees make. "
agf817,"NTA

You’re under no obligation, nor is it beneficial for you to blindly agree with everything the girl says. If she’s wrong and unwilling to admit it, you can choose to humor her or choose to make her face the fact that she’s wrong, or being childish or unreasonable or whatever. The choices you make now are going to have long term consequences. If you let her walk all over you now, its going to be really hard to change gears down the road, if there ends up being a future. Unless you want to be a “yes, dear” husband, you’d better start now...."
agf9f4,"NTA, did an evil beetle crawl up her butt? "
agfb3l,"Definitely NTA.

agfb6l,"YTA, dude, she is making some effort, near as I can tell. As a fellow picky person, I recommend just taking the remaining element of ""surprise"" out of the equation and just tell each other exactly what you want so that they get it with no deviations.

That, or have a little bit of fun with this gift game; you each pick a random store you aren't familiar with that's nearby, and the other person has to try to get a gift for you from that store. It makes for a fun adventure. "

agfnsp,"I’m going to say NAH. Her wanting her parents to be comfortable when they come to visit is completely understandable but at the same time you shouldn’t have to sacrifice your comfort In your own home. I wouldn’t want to give my bed up to anyone in my own home. 

Maybe you guys could go a little further with the compromise and invest in a pull sofa so they have a bed when they arrive instead of an air mattress. "

And hoping her surgery goes poorly enough that she can’t travel and misses out on a great trip is super manipulative and controlling and just plain mean. 

Reflect on yourself and do better in the future. "
aggb5w,"NTA - He is manipulating you - coincidently left something open on your computer, tried to argue about his privacy and then doesn’t want to finish the conversation- he is probably just as aware of the costs it’ll take for him to move home, he knows he can’t afford it, he can’t afford to be the bad guy.

agh26c,"NAH if all you said was he sometimes smelled. If you straight up said ""dont hire him because he smells"" that was an asshole move. You could have asked your boss to talk to him about his hygiene first. But like I said,  if all you said was he sometimes smells, NAH. You didnt actually ask him to not hire him. You brought up a concern you had about him that if your boss wanted to, he could easily have fixed without not hiring him. 


Your boss also isnt an asshole because he was just listening to his staffs concerns and did what he felt best. And the guy isnt an asshole because some people didnt really get a hygiene talk growing up."

aghxpc,"NTA. That kid isn’t and was never meant to be your responsibility. Reading your other replies I feel like you aren’t treating the child wrong despite your interioralised annoyance. 
However i encourage you to borrow someone else’s 5 or 6 year old child for a while. (Ask them first. Dont just take a random child, it is frowned upon). You’ll quickly see that most 6 year olds suck and behave somewhat similarly to your cousin. Autism or not, toddlers are shitty human beings. "
aghzb3,"NTA...but I wouldn’t recommend it. Like others have said, the suicide thing is a concern, even if it isn’t your responsibility. At this point, it sounds like he has expressed suicidal thoughts to you via text. I would recommend sending those to someone who can help (family, friend, hotline, police). If he’s serious then he needs the help, if he’s using that as a manipulation tactic he needs to learn that’s not okay - and that there are consequences.

Honestly, I would also let that person know that you found out because he was trying to cheat with you, and be open about that information. After he’s been helped I would then consider ensuring the gf knows how you found out and why you felt compelled to act. "
agi0zg,"NTA. Long as you just report the facts and dont interject your feelings into it, they can hardly get angry. If you do good things through bad means, it dirties your good thing. Thats a shame, but its no ones fault but your own if your good things are dirty"
agi2wf,"NTA.

Fuck him in the ass, and ask him how it feels. Your asshole, your rules."
agiaxh,"YTA for cheating on your wife. The guy being uber-hot is not an excuse to cheat. If something is not working, you need to communicate. You need to tell your wife what you did, and talk together about next steps (regardless of the outcome). Stop lying. If you and your wife decide to try and make it work, consider polyamory. Stop cheating. Talk to her."
agiiku,"NTA - some people are naturally clumsy, but she just sounds careless. It’s your stuff. She should take care or go somewhere else. "
agin4t,"NTA

That behavior is a little funky, but if I were you, I would try to bring it up in the most non-confrontational way possible. Casually asking why he was out that late should be perfectly fine. "
agiop1,"ESH . She's cheating and you're enabling it. 

The way this works is that she gets caught, you two get together, and then she cheats on you. "
agiw8d,"NTA but you shouldn’t have texted her anything. That wasn’t your smartest choice here but I don’t think it.
 makes you an asshole. She had it coming. "
agiy2z,"NAH, as you said, if it was such a big deal your mother would have told you weeks ago before your schedules came out. 

I definitely would **not** call in sick for either job, but if you can get someone to cover, even a portion of the shift, I'd try to go. "
agj0t3,[deleted]
agj2z7,[deleted]
agj4fc,"NTA. She made it clear that your friendship with her meant nothing if she didn’t have her way, unfortunately it took some time to show. The situation arose because of something your boyfriend did, it wasn’t even something you did, and she still treated you like that. 

Definitely NTA "
agjasr,"YTA if you knowingly went into it with the perspective of wanting someone to help you through a hard time and led her on in any way. That’s selfish as fuck, IMO. If this is that case, it’s using people. You’re not an asshole for breaking it off. You can break something off for any reason, and there’s no point staying if you just aren’t feeling it. "
agjb31,"ESH, her for talking you into installing that app, and potentially cheating and you for taking it to the next level with your trust issue and stalking behavior. 

I'd suggest that this is not the right relationship for either of you."
agjh60,"NTA don't know how many times I've gotten pissed off at my family for eating things I've brought without asking, even though 99 percent of the time I would say yes. Its rude doesn't matter weither its family or not. "
agjxkq,"ESH, just stop hitting each other and your problem will be easily solved. Also, r/BoneAppleTea for that great spelling of AWOL. Which technically is a lie, because he never went Absent Without Leave."
agk3f9,"NTA for not wanting to be around them, he's NTA for wanting to keep the peace. You should have confronted them though and you shouldn't have censored what you told your dad. In the future I wouldn't hide from the problem, I'd be down there with them and call them on their bullshit when they start getting out of line."
agk8qu,"NTA, watch out for the shadiness, I remember this issue about hospitals (or medical facilities) that only get the majority of their income from insurance money, they might try to prolong the problem so that money could be spent more. Since she needs the treatment, there's gotta to be another hospital or a doctor you really trust that could take care of her."
agke34,"I'm gunna go with ESH. First and foremost you posted to her wall knowing damn well it was in anger and trying to put her on blast, don't weazel out of the truth it makes you look bad. I also think you overreacted about the goodbye thing and sorta even made it about yourself. You, her, the roommate, everyone knew she was 'leaving'. However, she is absolutely being attention seeking and then doing the psycho thing where you make people who aren't involved think you are the victim in the situation. 

Just move on, people like that are trouble."

agkk9x,"NTA.

But, as a female who was into martial arts as a teen ... I’ve got to say it’s unlikely to help in an actual assault.

What you learn in a formal martial arts class isn’t what you’d learn in a good self-defense class for women.   

Learning to punch correctly might be enough for your average guy to defend themselves against another average guy.   But 95% of females are going to be so severely outmassed and outreached that skill and training won’t make up for it.   We have to fight dirty - ball-kicking, eye gouging etc.   Formal martial arts train you NOT to do those things.

Back in the day, I was pretty serious about training.  I could win medals competing.  But it was against females, in my weight division, who were also following the artificial rules of the tournament.    My male friends could pin me using just a fraction of their strength.

So if you want to do it as a sport, go ahead.   But ALSO take them to self-defence classes that are specifically designed for girls.   It’s a different skill set."
agknu6,"YTA- not for the stuff that happened when you were a kid, that’s on your parents or caretakers, but for slapping your gf so hard you left a bruise. That was abuse, plain and simple. Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is wrong, unnecessary, and horrible. I say this with all sincerity, please seek out a trained psychiatrist or psychologist who specializes in IPV and Batterer Intervention. Most existing Batterer Intervention Programs (BIP) are not designed for female batterers, unfortunately, but some do exist and I would encourage you to look for one. Look hard and immediately b/c right now, you are not only the asshole, you are a dangerous asshole who committed (depending on where you live) a felony."
agkplg,How did he react and how did it end up?
agkxyi,"NAH

You agreed to the ""quiet hours"" and if you agree to something you should follow up. As long as neither of you built the thin walls neither of you is wrong. It would be really easy tho to buy some noise cancelling headphones as example so i dont understand why both of you have to be petty about it."
agleoa,"YTA,
your godfather was probably a close friend of your parents. If it's not for him, go for them.
Lame excuse. Everyone gets sad when they see a coffin. This makes you even more an asshole. "
aglggu,"Hah, you really don’t know? YTA. Grow up and clean up after yourself. Do your *fair* share of the work and don’t treat your SO like a maid. "
agljxq,"NTA - you have shitty in laws and naive/weak minded partner.

Edit: grammar"
aglnsi,"YTA for sure. It sounds like you don’t believe people actually get raped. Also sounds like you’re assuming other people think the way you do (especially about the rapist’s dad’s decision making). I don’t see any credible reason for you to think she is lying. She may be lying, but you’re an asshole for assuming she is without a good reason other than the fact that it’s too hard for you to imagine rapists exist. "
aglogu,">She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child. 

Suggested reply to each and every one of those cocksuckers: ""Lead by example: even though the baby isn't yours, let her live with you.  Show, don't tell.""

NTA."
aglwix,"
First, you cant expect the world to accommodate you. 
Second, if you think a death stare is helping you cope, then do that. I dont really think its productive and a psychologist can probably suggest to you better coping mechanisms. "
agm8ml,"YTA. 

Don’t try to justify not breaking up with her now as you doing a favour to her as it would ruin her. 

Cheating is cheating regardless of the distance of the relationship. 

Be man enough to be honest with her."
agm9i0,"NTA.

If, I repeat, *if* she had not exhibited behavior like this before, in a previous relationship, you might have been an asshole; perhaps she needed counseling and was seriously depressed. But clearly your SO's behavior is manipulative to the exclusion of all other possibilities. She wants to control you. Stay. Out.

Edit: wc"
agme1n,"NTA.

Wow the server just automatically put the cocktail on your bill?? 

I find that so bizarre and inappropriate. I’m sure the restaurant could have easily covered one drink here. "
agme3z,"Nta for disliking smoking, but a bit of a dick to do that obviously just cause someone smokes in a public area. Ya it smells bad, But obnoxiously making noises is just as annoying."
agmh5s,NTA. They are your possessions. You could ask your siblings to tell your parents that they aren't interested though. To smooth things.
agmrc9,"NTA. It's your body and you decide what to do with it. 

HOWEVER, the fact that something is right doesn't mean it's consequence free. It may be petty from your boyfriend to be upset at it and even lose attraction/feelings from you, but then again it would be his choice and right to do it. "
agmtlj,"ESH, but at least he has the excuse of being fucking NINE. "
agmtp8,NTA. easy for him to blame you for destroying their marriage - he’s just mad he got caught. 
agmuz4,"NAH but please continue to encourage her to go to the doctor.  This will only continue and get worse if she doesn’t seek help and begin treatment for her depression.   

Also - those therapy apps are fucking horrible and shouldn’t be allowed.  Never had a good experience.  Tried em all.  "
agmwz1,"YTA

You can't just pretend that organized crime has no impact on anyone except for other criminals. They may not deserve death, but they're not benign."
agn7ri,"NTA - If someone just took my car without permission they would no longer be able to be in possession of my keys, for any reason. On top of that, I would have my keys on me at all times because of that. And they should never just hand out keys to cars to ANYBODY, with exceptions being permission, emergency, and things of those natures.

I would ask for someone you trust to go and retrieve the keys for you, because I wouldn’t want my neighbors to be able to use my car whenever, because not only do they now have access to anything stored in the car, they now also have access to take it for drives at night if no one’s paying attention/doesn’t care. I’m sorry for you and this scenario you’ve been put in. 

And also I’m sorry for you and your fiancée’s loss, I wish you guys and everyone involved my deepest condolences. "
agn9ub,"NTA, absolutely. 

Share your passwords if you want to, but demanding it from your partner AND saying you wouldn't reciprocate makes him a super asshole."
agne61,"NAH

Simple solutions: you divide the towels. You get 4, he gets 4. He does his laundry, you do yours. No reasonable person changes his towels out every day. "
agnm5f,"YTA. You are the old sibling, and your sister wanted food. With being only one minute away was not exactly a hardship to turn around and allow her to get food. You should be more mature."
agnpat,NTA Dogs are a lot of work and require a lot of time. You can’t even leave a puppy home alone for 8 hours a day unless you want pee and poop all over. It would be irresponsible for you guys to get a dog at this time.
agnpu2,I don't think this is the right subreddit for this. You probably need legal advice. 
agnwp5,NTA. He’s stopping you from living at this point and getting mad at you for it. Sounds like it’s time for a discussion about what each of you need to do in the home to keep the family functioning and what space you need to do it. 
ago3w7,NTA. Tell them you’re gay and they will stop calling. They don’t want gay blood. 
ago51u,"NTA, especially because he redirects his anger towards you. He needs to learn some coping mechanisms that he can do on his own."
ago8hu,"NTA, you're not obligated to hold the door anyway it's just polite, and you were being followed and trying to get away and holding the door would have slowed that down."
agodo0,"Yes, you are an asshole and petty! What do you  Appreciate your man and his sweet gestures or just tell him not to get you flowers.

What do you ever buy him? Do you ever buy him flowers or things he likes? "
agogoh,"NTA

Going against the grain with NTA

This man has to do keto to control his epilepsy. They told him they would make special diet accommodations and then didn't, screwing him over. 

So the fucking banned him from going to the events? **A single parent cant go to school events with their daughter anymore because he picked cheese off a dish?** And all you people think this is fair? Insanity. 

The punishment is completely disproportionate to the offense. Its just ziti. He didn't piss in the punch bowl people. "

agop31,"NTA - this is never a fun convo.   


You will be seen as the asshole no matter what, even though you're completely correct.  


Good luck."
agosf7,"Im confused, this sounds so made up.

1. Why didnt you confront him at the table?
2. Why didnt the dealer say anything? If its a casino then there are strict rules on table manners"
agoubs,"NTA - Give her an ultimatum and follow through. I'm not talking about the internet. Give her a set date to be working ANY job, or be a full time student by or kick her out. "
agp0d4,"NTA, why do you even still talk with your family? I would’ve moved away from them the first chance I got and never looked back. They sound like awful people"
agp6pn,"Nah dude, NTA. You agreed to one time, not the entirety of the day. There is a reason Uber exists and it's for situations like this. Tell your roommate it's time to take care of him/herself like an adult."
agp8hq,"NTA. You could see if your dad would like to headphones that allow him to listen to the TV at whatever volume he wants, but it won't disrupt the rest of you wanting the volume at a normal level. I believe SONY sells them, I'd start there"
agp939,ESH. This is stupid high school drama
agpfn0,"I get coldsorea. My wife doesn't.

When I have one I don't kiss her because why would I want her to get the infection...

Your fella is a bit of a dick.

Nta "
agpplg,"YTA big time. You spending money and a couple dates with a person doesn't require them to sleep with you. If you can't have the balls to be open and honest with this person, don't date anyone. "
agpq11,"Sorry, it was a life size statue of a gorilla sold at a specialty shop "
agpr0i,NTA - You are allowed to set boundaries for your health. She needs real psychiatric help. Maybe talk to her parents?
agpvd0,"This is a tough one. I'm gonna say that you're NTA, but don't be surprised if your brother doesn't respect you if you tell. Even if you have his best interest at heart. "
agq1dz,"NTA - Listen I know you had your hands full with your own life but for her to just suddenly disappear out of nowhere and then to nonchalantly reappear with an ""I'm fine"" pretty much without even going into detail about what happened, given what you both allegedly meant to each other, is just odd. Doesn't sound like you were that important to her and I think you weren't rash in your decision to ghost her."
agq9eh,"NTA

You made a dumb joke that wasn't offensive. Maybe not something you should say to someone you don't know, but they overreacted. "
agqbcb,"Ehs. He’s an asshole for saying he reaching out to you the last time, it was over at that point. However, you’ve been way more of an asshole. He says he likes you and you don’t say that you don’t like him but that he CANT like you. You invalidated his feelings so of course he needs time away. You got way tooooo clingy. His lack of a response was a response, you don’t keep messaging. It’s needy, weird, and too attached especially after what happened. You missed an obvious social signal. You keep telling him you’re anxious from being ignored, don’t like to be ignored, etc. When you’re ghosted(which sucks i know) you don’t harass and stalk, you move on. Tbh i think the reason you let him back in the last time, is for the same reason you keep going overboard on messaging. You’re needy and clingy, i won’t say desperate, but definitely took this way too far. "
agqcqx,"NTA for standing up for yourself, 

But YTA for how you did it. You should have spoken with him in private about your feelings towards his behavior. You treated him the way he was treating you, that’s not the answer. "
agqisd,[deleted]
agqitv,"NTA. 

Man, I'm a gal and I was all prepared to hem you to the wall with being an AH. But. You seem like a decent dude.  You didnt rush the actual night out, you were upfront about wanting to go back to your place, but why she couldn't stay the night. Nothing but honesty. Unpopular opinion here....but just because two people dont stay under the same roof after sex doesnt mean one party is shit. It just means people have shit to do. "
agqn6g,"NTA. If you can't pay rent, don't buy booze"
agqqkg,YTA in the context provided he made it a point to apologize and throughout the conversation was passive and not argumentative. Imagine how embarrassing it must have been and to still apologize to people individually. Your not wrong forinforming the mods but in this context YTA.
agqvos,"NTA If you write something in a diary that nobody is ever supposed to see you shouldnt have to apologize for anything written in there.

On the other hand reading someones diary and even more so confronting the writer about something in it is a massive cunt move. I would tell your mom that she should respect your privacy a bit more and that out of courtesy/respect you are going to treat this situation as if it never happened.

I would never apologize for what i write in a private diary. At most I would apologize to her that she was able to find it."
agr10n,"NTA *but* it is something you two should further discuss. 

I completely understand you not wanting them to be alone with her parents *especially* if that “murder-suicide threat” is true. 

It’s hard to admit that your parents are really that toxic and having children around them may not be the best idea. It’s going to be hard for her to realize how bad it is, but how important it is she protect them from them. 

It’s hard to be in both of your shoes, so just keep talking about your concerns with her. 

Good luck!"
agr1hz,"NTA.

Companies like that will fire you without notice, but expect you to give two week?  Nope. Do you."
agr1lo,"NTA

She was taking advantage of your kindness and she needed to be told. Good for you for sticking up for yourself."
agr36x,ESH! Hes a dumbass not responsible enough to own a dog and you're holding some weird vendetta against a dog for no reason.
agraup,"Nta, your parents sound abusive. Just remember when you move, bring all your important documents and change your mailing address."
agrcxa,NTA. He seems abusive and controlling 
agrs3x,"NTA, but no matter how you explain or justify it, you won't convince MIL.  If she wants to complain, listen and then just keep repeating, ""I'm sorry you feel that way.  We're looking forward to spending Friday with you.""  Further engagement will only make it worse.  Be polite, draw the boundary and stick to it."
agrsnh,[deleted]
agrtym,"YTA. Your girlfriend lost someone she cared deeply about and she wants to feel close to him.

You're going to have to make your peace with that."
ags80e,"NTA, why can’t your either your mother or your father stay home to take care of the dog. They don’t both need to be there with your sister to see the school.

It is ridiculous to have someone fly home to watch the dog. Especially when there are closer options. 

"
ags895,"Yes, 100% YTA. It’s okay if you don’t want kids but it’s shitty to lie to her in such a fucked up way. She’s likely sad, disappointed, worried something is wrong with her, etc and you could prevent it by communicating openly. "
agsaxm,"NTA, your husband needs to figure out his work/life balance pretty quickly or eventually all he's going to have is his work by the way your post sounds. "
agsmte,"YTA. He's being really inconsiderate of the feelings of everyone else involved, even if he was never 'official' with any of them, yet seems to be the only one not getting hurt. Hopefully he grows up and learns some empathy.

&#x200B;

Also, can you edit it so they have names rather than Female A, Female B, etc? This is already a complicated story and you're making it even more difficult to follow."
agstqo,"NAH at all. If you had told them, it would have just put them in the awkward situation of trying to make a hiring decision not based on the fact that you'd be taking leave so soon, while also keeping in mind that if they reject you they'd be vulnerable to a lawsuit. As things stand, though, you know they hired you because you're competent, not out of fear of a lawsuit, and if they'd rejected you, you'd know it was because you weren't a good fit, not because of the pregnancy. That's how it should be. It'll suck a tad bit to have you out but they'll get over it. You're still early and I'm not sure when people generally share pregnancy news so like, when you look suspiciously big maybe don't leave them hanging at that point?"
agsuk3,"Yeah man, fulfill your promises to your wife"
agsut8,NTA. Clearly inappropriate behavior and she’s kind of gaslighting you by trying to turn it in to a ‘You’ problem by saying ‘Why can’t you just be okay with it?’ Sounds like she’s your ex for a good reason. 
agsynh,Nta. Your mom doesn’t need to know what’s in the chat and she should not use you I find out
agt0h4,"YTA. If you know that he is bad with money, and you have no intention to pay it back *IN A TIMELY FASHION*, then yes, you would be an asshole here. Just because you plan to support him in the future does not excuse taking advantage of him in the present."
agt1rm,"ESH, her significantly more than you. She said that your dad told you to do it, and you took her word for it without speaking to him? And then you went through with it knowing what an absolutely idiotic idea it was? She's awful. Absolutely cut ties with her. But dude, you got to think this stuff through better. And next time, no matter how loud and obnoxious she gets you need to stand up to her. "
agt6qs,"NTA - I think you are certainly in the right, she is crossing the boundary but it's your bf that needs to sort it out. 
Going by my own previous experience, I would say that if he doesn't want to cut contact because ""she's nice"" etc etc..  then he has feelings for her and she may be round as a backup. 
You've done the right thing and would have done the same my self. Im (30m). 
If he doesn't respect that and wants to keep in touch with her I'd call it quits as he obviously values her friendship more than your relationship. 
Stay strong!"
agtnla," NTA but if it really bugs your inner nice guy side, tell them you take the spot as you’ve lived there the longest but you’ll contribute an extra $15/month towards the electric bill or something to that effect.  "
agtp21,"NTA at all. If you'd been dating six days, I could see a case for it being weird. But six months? That's a sweet gesture when you haven't seen each other much in a few days, and the fact that he reacted that strangely and showed no gratitude is a big red flag in my book. Even if he didn't feel comfortable for whatever reason, he could express gratitude for the kind INTENTION and ask that you not do it again. Saying it feels like stalking when you've been dating six months is just weird on his part. "
agtpyg,"NTA your dads an ass, Sorry"
agtqsd,"NTA, she's not respecting the boundaries your wife set in place. If you guys end up getting a restraining order, that's entirely her own fault. "
agtrbk,"NTA because he did agree to pay you but growing up in a family of five, we often stayed in rooms that only allowed four. The hotels knew but they didn’t care. I’m not saying to break the rules but lighten up a little. "
agtsmu,"NTA, your feelings are perfectly understandable."
agu2bc,"NTA. It's your stuff. You can do what you want with it. It's even worse that your roommate can't maintain it at the level you'd like and offers you nothing in return. Roommate relationships should be symbiotic, not parasitic. "
agu79i,[deleted]
agumty,"NAH. You are free to ask, and he is free to decline. The job application process can be grueling, and some people are more sensitive than others in regards to what information they wish to share about their experience. "
aguq27,NTA. He *is* a motherfucker. And you're a good person for standing up to it.
aguwr1,NTA because he's selling stuff out of the house and that could fuck you up as well. I'd probably talk to your dad first though since you don't want that to affect your relationship with him.
aguzr6,"NAH - I understand you wanting to include your extended family.  That being said, many times when you have that many kids at the wedding, there are a lot of distractions, especially kids under 6 or so. I can understand not wanting really young children.  Did she say why she doesn't want kids at the wedding?  (cost, distraction, noise, etc).  Some people allow kids at the ceremony but not the reception, or vice versa.  Is that an option?

Another possibility that I have seen would be to hire a babysitter or babysitters for the event where the kids can be kept entertained in another room, but still be at the reception.   On the babysitting website I used to use to find jobs, I used to see many people post that they needed a babysitter or two for a wedding to help with children coming in from out of town.

"
agv2ky,NTA he doesn't get to dismiss a woman talking about something a LOT of women agree on because he thinks a small group might be an exception. 
agv2oh,"yeah YTA, people can definitely pay attention to 2 things at once albeit you're spreading your attention out. Is it extremely crucial that she pays 100% possible attention to your readings?

Side note: yeah just let her knit while watching the TV"
agv4mt,NTA - you are completely right - what he did was not cool!  You could have fallen or hurt yourself - not to mention that you just don't go around touching people that you aren't friends with!
agv9zm,NTA - He seems far too unstable to have the toddler right now. You are probably making the best call for her safety. 
agvj7j,"ESH. She shouldn’t have forgotten your birthday, but you being passive aggressive about it is childish. Either point it out to her so you both can move on, or decide it’s not a battle worth fighting and get over it"
agvmpc,"NTA. Hell, you wouldn't have been an asshole if you hadn't floated it to your groomsmen first, considering a bachelor party is... You know, for you.

agw5te,"NAH, it sucks but situations like this just happen :) "
agwi4e,"NTA for quitting whenever you want. I've always found that to be a silly thing- your employer would not give you two weeks before firing you, so why should give two shits about leaving them stranded?"
agwjlm,"NTA. You shouldn't be forced to do something like this if you don't want to for someone that doesn't respect you. I'm actually shocked you haven't gone no-contact with her, and after years of abuse, I'd be hesitant to buy into her sudden nice act. I'd also find a way to get more comfortable with confrontation, otherwise, you'll be a sitting duck for the next abusive piece of shit that sets their eyes on you."
agwlpu,"Nta. He's responsible for raising his children, and that remark about you being jobless shows his true colours. Fair play to you for standing up to this guy who is clearly teaching his kids this or at least not educating them properly."
agwv95,"NTA,  if it was a secret they should have specifically told you not to mention it to anyone. But really, eventually people will find out, so no, NTA "
agx1fr,"NTA. Do not lend him money. I am automatically suspicious of anyone who tries to borrow money when they hear you have it, but the fact that he's constantly taking loans from friends and family sends up the mother of all red flags. Does your friend gamble?"
agxgnd,"NTA. This drives me absolutely nuts, I just can’t help but find it incredibly fucking rude. It would never even cross my mind to do this to someone else so I can’t fathom how others can do it, never mind to then say you’re an asshole for not liking it! "
agxr9m,"ESH.

sounds like you guys are young. Middle school, high school? Please don't say college.

If youre in college you kids seriously have a lot of growing up to do."
agxujy,"Nope. I think the whole ‘don’t date your friends exes’ is stupid. I dated a guy for a year, introduced him to my best friend at the beginning of our relationship, and a few years after we broke up they got married and had a kid together. Given, they’re divorced now because he cheated on her, but it didn’t bother me that they were together at the time."

agxvit,ESH. Honestly you guys sound dysfunctional as fuck. Obviously the son coming to stay indefinitely is a problem but I think this goes way beyond that.... Why isnt he doing anything to help his son go back home? Have you talked to him more about how this bothers you? I feel like there is some kind of communication problems between everybody in this 
agy6iv,From this id say NTA but you two seem to have some underlying issues 
agy794,"YTA. You broke up with her. She is more than free to go out and date whoever she wants whenever she wants. If you don't like it, move out."
agyg34,NAH. They were her friends first so of course they are going her way after the break up.  Life lesson learned.
agyl79,"NAH because it’s technically your body and you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. That being said...it seems like he does a lot of stuff for you. I don’t think one time would be the end of the world, especially since he’s not being coercive. "
agynog,"NTA. The real asshole here is the ""dd"". He shouldn't have got drunk and since he did, he should've taken everyone home in the morning."
agyovr,"NAH.  He asked for it.  And there is no good reason to lie.  If he wants to be a writer he needs to take good/bad/stupid basically all criticism to become a better writer.

~~INFO~~. Has he asked you to critique it?"
agyqso,"You're not wrong, you're just an asshole. You know the word ""hoe"" has a connotation which you choose to ignore, so YTA"
agyxhq,"NAH. But cmon dude put yourself in her shoes, she is always on social media and subscribes to that sort of stuff, then to her maybe it looks bad that you don't want to show her off. Just put the damn picture up it hurts nobody."
agyxjf,"NAH. It is understandable that your current boyfriend has concerns, but these are insecurities that he needs to overcome. There's no valid reason for you to not be friendly with your ex, you should be proud of having a healthy relationship with him."
agz2ft,"NTA

AA has meetings all the time, often multiple in a day in some cities. Working through the steps takes a long time for someone who is earnestly trying to make the change.

I would ask her questions about the big book and about her sponser and judge her truth telling on her replies to this. If she does not know what either are, she is not doing AA. You can also ask her to see her chips. 

Also,
Al-anon is an excellent support system for people who have addicts in their life. They have online meetings and a pretty active subreddit here. "
agz331,"YTA if you don't at least make the Atlanta (or somewhere comparable with a thriving theatre/movie/TV scene) concession.  I completely understand your feelings on New York, but dragging your wife to a place where she'll struggle to find meaningful, sustainable work, build a social network of her own, and likely suffer intense culture shock is just reversing the problem.  If you truly don't feel you can be happy anywhere but where you grew up, then it's time to have a serious conversation with her about whether your life goals are compatible enough to make this marriage function - and if the answer is no, then start figuring out an amicable separation."
agzci6,"Maybe I might get hate but Im gonna say NTA. Obviously you have feelings about your mom doing something like this. Youre entitled to those feelings. You seem to like your dad well enough, and her cheating on him affects you along with him. Plus, sounds like shes using your dads beliefs to get away with it since she knows he wont leave him, essentially having her cake and eating it to (since she knows shell always have her husband but can fool around as much as she wants). Sorry your mom is an asshole OP"
agzfvr,"YTA.  You didn't have to ""throw away the opportunity to travel""; you just had to be willing to sink in a little more money for separate accommodations and adjust your plans so you could go sightseeing as a single woman.  As it is, you deprived *him* of the opportunity to decide whether he wanted this trip to be a fond farewell, and you don't get to dictate how he feels about his memories of how things did go down in light of your subsequent revelation.  Acknowledge that you caused him pain that could've been avoided, and be more forthcoming when you've concluded things definitely aren't going to work out with future partners, even if that's going to involve some inconvenience or disappointment on your end."
agzh0x,"NTA. Firstly, you should have quit and run as soon as the director spouted off with their homophobic bullshit. 

Second, the company clearly has a history of screwing over the employees, as you have mentioned. If the company decided that they could pay someone less to do your job, you would be let go, with NO NOTICE, let alone a month of notice that they ask you to give them. 

The bottom line here is that ANY notice you give them puts you in a precarious situation. You could put in your notice tomorrow and they could say ""Oh cool, don't come back to work after today dawg."" Would you miss that month of pay? PROBABLY DAWG. Nahmsayin?"
agzt85,NAH - She's voicing health concerns. You're doing something you enjoy.
agzwca,NTA.  You have very valid concerns and it’s also not fair his friends are being little children about this.  
ah00nx,"YTA for continuing to push her to talk about it right when *you* wanted to know about it instead of asking her if she's ready to talk about it later on.  She told you that you always lecture her and then you lectured her.  If you want someone to feel safe talking to you, you're going about it all wrong.  I also think you're a jerk for publicly sharing a private conversation assuming she doesn't know you're posting texts."
ah01yi,"Seems like you're looking for validation, but NTA.  If this dude is actually so important, his manager should get off his ass to make reservations instead of waltzing in."
ah04cz,"ESH. She was acting like an asshole, but you way overreacted. Shouting and throwing things is never a good look. Call it a wash and move on.  "
ah0a9o,A year is not too soon. Your mum and dad's marriage was probably over long before they got divorced. You walked into THEIR room and found lube. That's on you not them. What kind of under garments a woman wears does not say anything about their personality. You seriously need to grow up cause ya acting like an asshole in this situation.
ah0agx,"NAH. It's okay to ask. It's okay to question why she was still following him. It would not have been okay to demand that she do so... which you did not do, since you simply asked her and she complied."
ah0fxt,"NTA. You apologized and she doubled down. Move on, you don't need the stress of that friendship. "
ah0req,"NTA.  It's above your pay grade to take care of someone with depression.  You can reach out and let him know that you love spending time with him but it's hard to maintain the friendship when he cancels last minute.  Is he in treatment?  If you're in the US, you can send him a link to [Psychology Today's psychiatrist search function.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/psychiatrists?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkIb-q7n13wIVkojICh1YPgYqEAAYASADEgK1E_D_BwE)  You don't need a one sided friendship.  Depression can explain things, but it's not an excuse."
ah0rqt,"NAH.  She's proud of you.  Ask her to dress up as a schoolgirl and see you during ""office hours."""
ah0wae,"YTA if you go to see her or her baby without getting these shots.  Do not lie to her if you refuse to be immunized.  You can't control whether you pass anything onto the child if you go to visit, so your only option is to stay home.  Your requirements are yours to make, but she's completely reasonable to require all visitors to be immunized.  Why don't you want to get the flu or whooping cough shots?"
ah0ytf,Kinda ESH. Maybe just leave the neighbours a note or try and communicate your concerns first. You could end up forcing these dogs to be taken away from a happy and healthy home
ah0zgc,"YTA.  You'd drive a 14 year old to the hospital but not his mother?  What kind of person are you?  I hope you're not proud of yourself for this.  Having a blue finger very well may be an emergency.  You don't sound qualified to make that diagnosis, especially without imaging or the education for it.  While his mother was rude, you needed to swallow your pride and help the kid."
ah0zo4,NTA. Your Dad doesnt sound like a good person just to start off- but you have a right to know about the well-being of your family members and be updated on such issues. Im not sure if its big enough to really get mad over; but you definitely arent the ahole for wanting accurate information about your grandparents regardless if you have little contact with them or not. 
ah11z3,"NAH - If you sit down and talk to her calmly and phrase it like you are uncomfortable around him because of his attitude and give examples, then she should understand. Though you do not have a right to demand she cut off all contact you can ask that she respect that you do not wish to be around him and that he not be invited to your place. "
ah1cj3,"NTA. 

(1) Being a drunk mess doesn't excuse bad behavior. 

(2) It's not your fault they decided to travel when they are broke. "
ah1dmg,"NTA - I don't see you committing any actual faults here. I'm not sure how you became a stalker? I'm pretty sure the original girl ghosted you due to lack of sex. 

&#x200B;

INFO - Who the hell is Girl 1?!  I thought girl 1 was the original Tinder date, but by the end, I'm thinking girl 1 is the last girl you made out with. Use fake names, it's so much easier on the brain."
ah1ics,"*IF* you're pretty sure she's lying, then NTA, but if you believe her story about the injury, then YTA. It's not reasonable to expect someone to ignore an injury and limp through an event in serious pain. Shit happens, and sometimes people have to miss someone's big day. And re: eating the cost, you paid the same amount for the plate whether she was there or not, so unless you think she accepted the invitation without ever taking it seriously, that's not a valid complaint.

(FWIW, I don't find her story hugely credible either. Long-winded excuses like that are almost always BS.)"
ah1jbz,NTA - your step dad should be a functioning adult 
ah1jvr,"NTA. Your boyfriend sounds like he’s incredibly unsupportive of your relationship with your son, and whether that’s maliciously intended or not it’s still bad behavior. Honestly? Get rid of him"
ah1kwt,"NTA. 

Sounds like your girl is a sugar baby. Sorry man. "
ah1ml4,"INFO

Why was the couch given to them?

If they received it as a favor from your parents (i.e. he couldn't afford one) then I think it's kind of an asshole move to turn around and sell/replace it in short order. 

If they asked for it and then sold I also think YTA in that situation. Parents could have sold it themselves and pocketed the money.

If they received it for any other reason then I think it's fine to turn around and sell it."
ah1o8h,"NTA by any stretch! He confirmed he’d pay you back, now he’s conveniently going back on his word when the time has come. What a mooch. "
ah21dc,"NAH, it’s just polite. Similar to thanking a bus driver, sure they’re just doing what they’re being payed to do but it’s just common courtesy to thank them."
ah22qp,"NTA.

They key here is this: **your roommates**. You would, 100% be an utter an complete asshole to invite your bros unknown friends to crash in shared space with no notice. They should look for a hostel or something. You wisely realized it was not your place to have randos over. Good call. "
ah28bb,NTA. Mom needs to learn how to text.  
ah29uo,"NTA. You're not an asshole for a seemingly harmless comment. But in general talking about someone behind their back (especially negatively) is pretty high on the assholery scale. In addition, your friend that informed him about your comment is pretty much an asshole for doing that and creating drama."
ah2c67,NTA.  The point of breaking up is not having to be around the fucker.
ah2csg,"NTA. If it was a gift, I’d have just taken them but not since they wanted money. They bought you something you didn’t ask for, and in fact said you already had. They can easily return them so you’re not an asshole. "
ah2djw,"YTA. If you can't take care of your pet, you should give your pet up. Up until now, you are still taking care of your pet cause you found another home, but now Turnip got the eviction notice. Either figure it out, or foster the kitty to someone who can."
ah2m1f,[deleted]
ah2skf,[deleted]
ah2ykh,"NTA, you don't owe her grief. Even if she and been a better person towards you, you deal with your emotions, or lack thereof, your own way. A reason to visit her now would be you help someone you love deal with their emotions, and stand by their side."
ah2yzk,"NTA- you’re not responsible for another adult’s bad choices. Drinking is fine, but assuming someone else is going to pay for it is bad form.
"
ah36iu,"ESH- you clearly saw your dad railroading you into visiting yet you let the assumption stand.  Then your mom gave you and out and you let it pass; finally, you stood up for yourself (kind of) and now you feel bad.  Seriously, be clear in your communications and strong with your boundaries. "
ah39zr,"INFO Are they getting up at that time because they need to get to work, college, or whatever?

If so, YTA - it’s awkward for you, but what else are they supposed to do?

If not, probably ESH - if they’re paying fair rent, you have no more right to impose your schedule on them than they do on you. You both need to try and be more considerate and understanding. "
ah3aia,"I don't think you're an asshole, but I do think you're in the wrong here. She's doing what's best for her career and her life. You aren't really being supportive. Also, you're 30, get a job. Even if it's not something you want to do, your parents are way past the point where they should have to support you. "
ah3g86,"NTA

Sounds like you’re caught in a shit situation, one much like what I used to be in. The good news is you don’t have to live with him forever. He might get over himself, he may not. You never have to like him, per se. I don’t think I would. Grit it out if you can."
ah3gje,NTA. You paid her back and obviously had cash-on-hand so an attempt was made. Her assuming that you were supposed to pay isn’t a great attitude though. 
ah3hdd,"YTA. You’re busy on social media ignoring your mom while she drives you around. Perhaps she is annoyed by your social media use. Either way, you’re being petty."
ah3mhj,"NTA - What if she was OD'ing and you assumed she was nodding, what would the family say then? Be thankful you got out of that toxic relationship - sorry to say but they all sound like a bunch of degenerates."
ah3oo8,"NTA, he set you up dude. He knew it was burnt but didn’t want to pay for a replacement. Some “friend”."
ah3p0t,"Everyone Sucks Here

First off your dad should be aware that you’re at least job hunting and he should appreciate you taking time off to help and not get mad for frivolous things

But, I feel like you’ve got a sense of entitlement I.e. if I help someone I should get paid which is fair but, he is your father, he raised you, he’s keeping a roof over your head etc (I say this because you said you live with your parents) and finally, he didn’t make you get out of town to get your meds AND make you work so at least it’s not overbearing or cruel.

But that’s just my opinion. Hope it all works out!"
ah3pnb,"YTA. When my boyfriend has a zit that's throbbing, it makes him feel better if the ingrown hair that usually caused it is plucked out. He always gets me to do it for him. Do I hate it? Absolutely. It's the most disgusting thing on the face of the planet, as far as I'm concerned. But I do it because I know it makes him feel better and alleviates his physical pain. Why wouldn't you want to help your girlfriend? Her problem is even way more serious than my boyfriend's. It's a sacrifice for the one you love."
ah3va8,"NTA- you wanted boundaries and you told him, he talked to other people about you that he doesn't even know and proceeds to ask them out for you is weird as fuck and he's using a third party to manipulate you. He might be manipulative consciously  but it's probably still best to steer clear"
ah3xu6,"NAH. I would guess that she's just trying to bond with you and compliment you on having a cute bf and doesn't realize how creepy she's coming off. I'd try talking it out with her before cutting her off completely, but you can also just keep giving her the fade. You don't have to have a good reason to not be feeling a friendship anymore."
ah3ysw,"Nah.

She obviously holds her virginity high and like a very special gift. So ter her, she was giving you the greatest gift she has to offer. Her virginity. To her, that's pretty damn important and a huge thing.

You aren't a female, so the value of virginity isn't as high with you as her. You expected gifts, and that's what she's offering.

I hope that explains a bit? "
ah3zhn,"I think you humiliated yourself twice.

Nta"
ah416o,[removed]
ah43fi,"NAH. What you’re feeling is probably exceedingly normal. You’re not actively trying to break them up or being a jerk to the girlfriend or your brother. I’m sorry you feel replaced, but no one can replace a brother. "
ah44up,"YTA, you aren't ""entitled"" to a parking permit if the dr. twice said you aren't. You may feel like you are, and I'm sorry you're in pain, I've been there before. There were much better ways to get your way without threatening a malpractice suit. 

Throwing the malpractice word around was a total douche move, and screams of entitlement, and being bipolar (whether you've actually been diagnosed with it or not) is no excuse. My wife is bipolar and has schizoaffective disorder and I don't here her going off on people just because she didn't get her way. 

I hope this was the hill you were willing to die on, because you just **screwed** your relationship with your dr."
ah462f,"NTA...unlike everyone else here, I would also be annoyed. It may be different if he was sharing things that were actually funny, but “I’m single I can do whatever the fuck I want” is not really that funny, it's just a statement?? He is also the one that brought up deactivating in the first place, but now he's upset about it? Seems a little unfair to you "
ah4bgc,"NTA, your husband is being discourteous to you and your roommates and he needs to clean up after himself. You are his wife, not his maid. "
ah4d6l,"Not the asshole.

Your ""friend"" is just using you the get free games. He done you a service by removing himself from your life."
ah4gwy,"NTA, when people keep animals in that condition alive it is selfish. "
ah4t6j,[removed]
ah530v,"NTA

He’s got to grow up and learn eventually. Maybe this is a *wake* *up* call."
ah55i6,"NTA, that's a boundary breaker in many relationships. "
ah59ea,"YTA. It’s an extra 15 seconds of your life. Plus come on, you get to watch her walk away! Should be a good view. "
ah5bdg,YTA for not putting a tldr for this wall of text.
ah5e8o,... SHP? I feel like I've seen this movie several times before.
ah5edc,"YTA. As they are famliy dogs, these dogs are your dogs too, right? Then you were aware when you left your belongings out, that your dogs could possibly get into your room as the latch that closes the door was broken? You should have been aware that the dogs could damage your stuff."
ah5hn4,"NTA, however these things happen and though it seems like a big deal now, in the grand scheme of your life it really isn't. 

Congratulations on your achievements. "
ah5l1c,"ESH

The dude should of taken off his hat for you to enjoy the show but you didn't have to knock his hat off on purpose"
ah5p8s,"NTA

It's voluntary, right, how can you be an ass for saying no? If they really needed you, it wouldn't be voluntary. 

Although, keep in mind that because you keep turning them away - it doesn't make you an asshole but it's not entirely repercussion free. 

As a few examples: They may not play nice if you ever need something in return from them and if they ever have to throw people on the chopping block to be laid off, your name may be higher on that list than it normally would be.

Up to you if that's worth dealing with vs a bit of overtime work."
ah5pkc,"Yep.  You are the asshole.  

He is your BF not your husband.  Stay out of his finances and business/ money matters.  

He probably does not want to deal with a rookie agent.  No one does.  

"
ah5qa0,"Nta.

She agreed to pay like last time. Cold hard cash.

If it was to be in the form of a keg she should've asked beforehand. Being paid in material shit is like a straight trade. And that wasn't stated. "
ah5zin,"Why did I think you meant a literal theme party of fortnite🤣 Anyway, NTA. You had a good reason to kick him out since he was being toxic to you guys."
ah60lq,"NTA

It's not their roof, it's the managements and your roof. Neither of you want the dumb asses on it. End of story.

They sound fucking entitled af. "
ah626g,"NTA - you pay for it. Doesn't matter how much it costs, it's more than what they pay for it. If they don't like it, they can not fucking park in reserved spaces.

Tow the mufuckers."
ah62rm,I would have gone no contact after date one. Move on . 
ah6afc,"NAH 

People who are going to kill themselves don’t leave others a “save the date”.

Humans don’t have a natural reflex to “open car doors” when they pass out. 

That was sadly my first thought. 

If you’ve done this sort of thing before. Which I suspect you have, they likely simply didn’t believe you. 

I think you wanted them to come and save you.

And It’s the wrong kind of attention you’re after, setting up lose/lose scenarios don’t help anyone especially yourself. 

So please, make an appointment with a counsellor. Talk things through. These actions are only damaging your relationships with your friends which I can tell you love very much. "
ah6afp,NTA and dispute it. Say that a man assaulted your wife and you threatened him if he assaulted her again. Do they support men assaulting women? If so you will go to news agencies about them.
ah6cf4,"NTA

It's not her placard to use so she's committing fraud. She should go through the application process like everyone else who has one did. 

However, I'd expect them to figure out that it was you who reported her as there's only a few people that really know who the placard belongs to. 

Up to you if you feel that possible outcome is worth reporting her or not."
ah6feo,"YTA for not telling him. He's an adult, he can handle not going. Don't lie because you're too worried you'll hurt someone's feelings. It pretty much always makes things worse."
ah6sep,"NTA.  Does he thank you for doing your parenting duties daily?  He's a parent, not a babysitter.  While it's nice to share appreciation with your partner and coparent, you shouldn't have to thank him for taking care of his own child."
ah73bc,"ESH

What on earth are you doing? 

He’s given you an ultimatum that it’s your job or him: the guy who lied about having sex, is mean and cruel, has broken up with you 12 times, is revolted at the thought of sex with you and now wants you to lose your job.   

This isn’t a hard choice.  Pick the job.

The reason I say everyone sucks is that you’ve got to take some ownership of the fact you keep going back to this guy.   That doesn’t make you an asshole, but it’s incredibly dumb."
ah744j,"YTA you cheated on this poor girl you kissed this other girl  for a few minutes with tongue the thing you should’ve done was pushed her off you she shouldn’t have even been able to kiss you but you allowed it to happen and went with it 
And you deserve to be dumped you mildly realised that you fucked up surely but you do not get the right to put this other girl in a position where you’ve just cheated on her and won’t tell her that’s fucked.  You are the major asshole"
ah748v,"NTA. You have very good reasons to not attend, even if/when you are asked. Just be adult. Say no. Tell her that you have too much work to do."
ah74gy,"YTA . It's snowing. He got you food , go to sleep and give the poor fella a break . 
 "
ah781k,"NTA pretty standard for all roommates to split utility bills regardless of ""usage"", if it was significantly more expensive that's one thing, but it isn't. 

Also, what internet provider do u use? For mine it's just a flat rate regardless of usage. You pay extra for faster service not for more usage? Maybe consider switching providers."
ah781w,"NTA for wanting to tell your friend. But you WBTA if you don't confront her about it and push her to tell him. If that doesn't work, telling him yourself is not an asshole move."
ah79co,"YTA.

Dogs aren't as relaxed on their own as cats. Leaving them alone to their own devices for so long is so damaging to their mental health, let alone what potential shenanigans they might get into.

Either pay for a dog sitter or pay to board them. "
ah7a5m,"YTA, I’m struggling with reasoning other than it’s something (IMO) very childish. It’s a movie you can pop it in again, clearly he likes it otherwise he wouldn’t have watched it. Also OP you’re missing out on a lot of damn good cinema, step out of your comfort zone a little, you’d be surprised at the gems out there in the movie world. Lastly...holy fuck what a random selection of movies you listed."
ah7afu,"Nah.

He has his preference, you have yours.

I neglect to shave during the winter, and shave for spring n summer only. That was the compromise for my relationship. And quite frankly, he says he doesn't care, as long as he's still able to get some. Lol "
ah7btf,"Nta.

He knew 2 weeks ago he was behind on payment by months. 

Hes probably doing it cause he wouldn't be able to go on the trip, and in turn force you to have to stay there, and throw something waaaay cheaper at home. "
ah7hh7,"NTA. I think it’s awesome that you watch your little sis, and hopefully your parents appreciate your contribution. (As you mentioned, daycare for newborns ain’t cheap!) I’m honestly surprised that after being gone all day, that they don’t look forward to that bonding routine with her at night. Hopefully you can just speak with them reasonably, and let them know that while you appreciate helping out and spending your days with her, you need some time at night to unwind and relax as well. "
ah7hju,"ESH.  

You were a complete asshole.  At college age, threatening to shame your parents publicly over a plane ticket is pretty horrendous.  

They shouldn’t make promises they don’t plan on keeping or they should write things down if they don’t remember well but putting them on blast (or threatening to) is no way to resolve a family dispute.  "
ah7jge,"Probs not the right sub, but yeah leave her alone dude"
ah7o1g,"NTA. Your friend should’ve trusted you and respect how you feel about it. I think they are too insensitive, and immature. So I think you did the right thing. You didn’t like them saying it so you spoke up, and your “best friend” didn’t have your back. Definitely NTA. "
ah7uf9,"NTA

People are so grumpy sometimes."
ah7wzn,"NTA 

You don't have to talk to anyone you don't want to, blood or not. It's cool and all that she's trying to change for the better, but she still spent probably decades abusing your mother and I dont think I could just look past that, either. 

I wouldn't wish any ill will towards her, I just wouldn't want to associate with someone like that."
ah8bn5,"ESH

throwing out electronics, especially ones with personal shitnon it, is an asshole move. Phone could have easily been dead since being covered in snow isn't really healthy for a phone.. "
ah8kfx,"YTA - it doesn't seem like you had a meaningful conversation about your struggles with the addiction. Just that you said multiple times, that you'd stop, but didn't. And the fact that you tried to hide it from him was probably making it worst. At a certain point, it's not about the smoking but about everything around it, the fights, the hiding, the lies... And please, fix your relationship. But leave reddit out of it. Showing him what strangers think about your relationship, that you put out there without him knowing, may make it worse. I hope you two make up and that you can overcome your addiction! "
ah8ks5,Fuck no. Don't apologise. You don't fuck around with people's phobias.
ah8nm0,NTA. He’s the asshole for making everyone else wait for him. Seems pretty straightforward to me. 
ah8obj,"NTA. She doesn't have a ""right"" to have sex with you, and it's gross that she's angry at you for not being willing to have sex with her while you're half asleep. It's your body, your sleep schedule, and you shouldn't feel bad for not wanting to/being able to have sex.
"
ah9d8j,"NTA, but I am wondering....there are always matress sales this time of year - why not just buy another bed for a guest bed? It wold probably be like a couple hundred (at most) and would save you a lot of problems here.

That being said, you should really address it with your wife as to why she isn't going ""Oh its your parent WHO HAS CANCER, they can have the bed. what else can we do for them?""

Like..major major red flag.

ah9t1x,For clarification: this is a validation post.
aha327,NTA. She asked your advice and you gave it. Unfortunate that it didn't pan out but she won't be asking for advice any time soon.
aha3tl,"NTA, she's the asshole. She raped you. You didn't consent and don't remember anything. I am so sorry that happened to you. If I was your friend and my fling did this to you, I would want to know that way I can cut someone as toxic as that out of both our lives."
aha7a0,"YTA if you think you can know enough about someone to judge them from afar, period.   

You just never know what goes into their life and the challenges they face.   

IMO you're simply envious and don't know how to handle it.   
You *handle*  it by not worrying about other people's business and getting busy improving your own."
aha8lj,"YTA. A very minor asshole though, you probably could have been more discrete about it haha."
ahaxmz,Clearly NTA. They cant complain about you disturbing their sleep once when theyve disturbed yours for a year.
ahbbw4,"NTA She's taking advantage of your kindness, but know that if you ask her to move out, the relationship will likely be over. "
ahbd1g,"NTA, as long as you stick with ""I'm not interested"" or ""please don't contact me again.""  In fact, it's arguably better to be clear so she doesn't waste her time on trying to get a response from you.  Once you've said it, though, you should go ahead and block so you don't get drawn into an argument."
ahbnjq,"NTA.

Although I don't fully understand the cultural problem and therefore don't think my opinion should be a deciding factor on that particular facet of the issue, you're an adult and have every right to travel without their permission."

ahbt25,NTA. You got one hell of a nosey cousin. What's the point in relaying the info to your mom only to go ahead and lecture her any way. To be honest what she did is worse than what your sister did.
ahc0nd,YTA for flirting with a married woman and endangering you and your brothers business relationship
ahc3v4,"YTA. You meant well by introducing him to another group but that just gives the new kid the vibe that he's ""their problem now"", if you get what I mean.

I think it'd be much more helpful if you'd tell him that people find it rude that he's on his phone, or whatever else he's doing that annoys him. Of course he's going to be boring, he's trying to find his feet in a completely new situation where everyone already likes and knows each other. Take him in and i'm sure he'll get out of his shell a little. At the very least give him the chance to do so."
ahc4uh,"YTA. It sounds like you blew them off for new years. You had plans with them, you changed your plans, and then when they texted you day of you changed your mind. You could have at least had the courtesy to let them know you were changing your plans. "

ahcnuh,"NTA, she wants you to get your license revoked cuz she can't get an Uber ?"
ahcoan,"NTA  -  **You do not owe anyone your affection.**

“R” needs to learn this and treat you with respect if he wants to retain you as a friend.  However, I hope that your group really gets the lesson, too, lest his immature behavior causes a fissure in the bunch.  

I’m sure he will act out upon your boyfriend arriving, and when you face any turbulence, remember the mantra above.

... and if you can work it, boot “R” from the group because his misogynistic behavior is disgusting."
ahcr4d,"NTA.  Kids need to learn how to lose.  When our youngest (much younger than his siblings) was little, we all let him win at board games and cards all the time.  I never thought about the negative impact.  When he was about 5-6, my close friend's son (12) wanted to start babysitting to earn money.  I brought out all the games and favorite movies so they wouldn't be bored.  Our child lost at a game for the first time EVER.  He had a complete meltdown.  My friend explained what happened later, as her son had called her instead of us and he hadn't said anything about it when we got home.  We changed how we played from then on.  I don't think it hurts to let someone win SOMETIMES, but definitely not all the time!"

ahdmqr,"NTA

> we have not had the best relationship in the past

just cut your losses here and move on. His comment on cute was definitely sufficient for you to make your comment. If it was a straight friend who made the comment about another straight friend, you would have likely also made the same comment, except with ""he's single"".

ahdmrx,NTA. Real men change their socks everyday. Your bf is a nasty ass. 
ahdmyq,"NAH

> So none of us really know the reason. 

So you know your father is capable of doing despicable things, but you've never seen him do them to your sister, so you assume she freaked out for no reason?

Perhaps she's just crazy, maybe there is something you don't know. We can't call her an asshole based on that.  
If you have forgiven your father to the point you're ready to cut ties with your sister, it's your choice to make. Hence, NAH.

ahdpq4,"ESH, leaning YTA - Him for trying to manipulate you, but you're the one who started a relationship because you didn't want to lose him as a friend. You knew that you weren't into him and that's not fair to do to him.  You did have a choice and you decided to make the one that was no doubt going to end up causing more issues. "
ahdvju,"YTA - sounds like you've massively overreacted to her comments and immediately jumped to the worst possible conclusions. Perhaps there is more context that you're leaving out, but that's how it appears to me just from what you've said here.

Neither of her messages give off any red flags for me. She doesn't say or imply that she wants to control you and your spending habits, but instead that she's sensibly thinking forward to your future together. Perhaps you could argue that she could have expressed it better, but you went from 1 (""don't buy any more furniture because I don't want there to be a chance that it goes to waste when we move in together"") to 100 (""don't tell me what to do, you can't control me!"") real quick."
ahe60m,"NTA 

Seriously, if the other two lunches were paid for and this lunch was advertised as a team building lunch, it would only be right to assume that the host of the lunch would be your boss (through the company).

ahe72z,"NTA, druggies are a waste of time. There is nothing you can say or do to help or control them really, they need to decide that for themselves before any progress can be made.

ahealn,NTA for bringing it up when she's frustrated. But WBTA if you brought it up other times. Let her figure the rest out on her own. You've already mentioned it so she's aware. 
ahec17,"NTA, your roomate is a Karen

Edit: Came to add more since I was in a rush. She sounds like she's nitpicking to get something out of it. She won't be happy with anything until you give her full control. And even then, it wont be enough

ahefb3,"NTA. Common procedure to do so at a restaurant. In fact, a good server would have brought you back singles to begin with. "
ahehoh,"You know, that’s a very fair point. Thank you. It is better to be up front than side stepping it. "
ahel01,"NTA. I was in a similar situation with my great grandmother. You could do everything you can and they completely forget about all the help you’ve been the ONE TIME you couldn’t. 

The shitty part too is you don’t wanna highlight what you have done because then they think you’re only helping to get something in return or brownie points for the will, etc...

All that being said, idk what your relationship with your grandma is but either way dealing with that on a daily basis is not easy. Maybe sit down and have a heartfelt talk if you can."
ahergg,"Nta.


I have a daughter who is also 16.

When her grades started to fall, I had a calm conversation with her about why this was happening. Turns out she has social anxiety and has panic attacks. So she couldn't do some major projects that involved standing in front of the class.


So I took her to the doctor, got the proper meds while working with her teachers to find out different ways she could present.

With proper support she's back up into good grades and is actually getting better with her anxiety and attacks.

Your mom is not parenting proper. You can't expect your child to do great things without the tools to achieve.

Is there any way your dad can take you in to get your meds adjusted? "

ahf8py,"NTA.  If he wants to become a misanthropic pain in the ass, you aren't obligated to sit there and endure it.    I'm not sure how your other friend thinks you need to get to know someone you've hung out with since middle school *better,* so I think you can ignore their take on it."
ahfcky,"NTA - Your Karen needs to back up. It's your body, you're good to go. "
ahfi3q,"NTA - That “not having anyone to cook with :-/“ remark is kinda creepy.  You wouldn’t be the asshole for informing your boss, but I understand the fear of blowback.  It’s only gonna get worse from here on out if you don’t put your foot down.

“Hey, Boss. I’d like to put this on your radar real quick: I was minding my own business at lunch at my desk, and John eavesdropped on my phone conversation from the bathroom. I know the bathroom is right next to my desk, but he’s been interrogating me over it via text during and well after work. **I find it very distracting.**”"
ahfkyg,NTA. My company's policy is not to disclose you've received the promotion until all applicants have been notified that they were not selected. That also helps cut down on the rumor mill.
ahflc6,"YTA even though I understand. Just because they're going to date doesn't mean you won't get to see them separated, come on."
ahflo8,"NTA, having a problem with this is completely justified. Not using that language as a convenience for them rather than out of respect for you is shitty."
ahfmj6,"YTA, kind of, but it's a little complicated.  


First of all, you'd actually be in your rights to uninvite your sis (or at least uninvite her babydaddy) for the express reason that she's attached at the hip to a homophobe and it's a gay wedding. But that's not the reason you gave. The reason you gave is that she... got pregnant... and it so happens her due date is near your wedding. That's childish nonsense."
ahfsdx,"ESH

I’ve been in the position of your friend, where I was basically seeking attention and depressed (luckily I’ve moved on from that immaturity and got real help). I say ESH because I’m sure your friend wasn’t aware that she was being heavy, but at the same time people can always limit what they say. That’s how I started getting better instead of unloading on everyone. It isn’t fair to others around them. Concerning you, sometimes people can be oversensitive (especially if they’re how your friend is) so you should also watch how you say things. One of my friends once snapped at her suicidal friend, and they tried to slit their wrists because they were so hurt. So I wouldn’t want you, OP, to have to feel like you were responsible for anything, even though you were only meaning to give her a wake- up call"
ahfyar,"ESH. Is there really no middle ground between cutting off your friend entirely and being so close that your girlfriend is jealous? Also, if you were ""exclusive fwb"" that means you were functionally dating. She's your ex. Of course your girlfriend is going to wonder what's going on and feel a little uncomfortable.

But it is also extreme of your girlfriend to ask you to cut people out and to not trust you like that."
ahg8d6,"ESH

Just because shes technically family doenst mean you have to tolerate abuse. I wouldnt let her into my house or even talk to her again until she apologised. Or your brother for that matter for enabling her."
ahgge7,"NAH. You were open and honest and that's never wrong. It's natural for your girlfriend to be upset, you'll just have to give her time to come to terms with it"
ahghry,"NAH, since your dad never said what method he wanted by rejecting all options until his death, it'd be impossible to actually do what he wants. Might as well go with cremation.

ahgit8,NTA for not buying a gift. The dinner and card were definitely enough to count as a gift. It was a bit of an asshole move to mention those old gifts though. 
ahgv9u,"YTA for this ginormous wall of unreadable fragmented text.

ahh1wy,"NTA. Just wanted to address your edit

>Edit: As much as I hate it, I'm going to switch in the vegetarian meals for meat based. I'll make my own separate dish. It's best to avoid an argument or future conflicts 

This is a bad idea. What you'll be telling them is that they don't have to respect you and that they can bully you into submission. This is a bad precedent to set, especially if you think this relationship will last."
ahh4q8,NTA. He has a medical issue that is dramatically decreasing your quality of life and isn’t trying to fix it. 
ahh57a,"ESH - She should have called you first. Maybe you would have been okay with spending some time with him if you had some warning instead of being ambushed.

Also, I dunno, I have little ones and if my husband has free time (he works a lot) he tries to spend time with them even if he’s tired. It wasn’t fair that she tried to drop him, but it’s really important at this age for him to spend time with his dad too. "
ahh7bh,"NTA in reality, but personally I feel like YTA. Your brother is going to find it else where and now you are going to have two people just pissed off with you. You rather have some rando salngin to your brother that could be laced or someone you trust."
ahh7cf,[deleted]
ahhak5,"NAH... you haven’t said that this is a regular thing, she could just be feeling a little lonely or down because she is out of work making her a bit more needy than usual. Girls do tend to be a little more clingy and needy than guys but we’re not so bad. "
ahhtj0,"NAH. They're not obligated to invite you and you're not entitled access to someone else's house. You can make an honest mistake and it's good you apologized, but an apology is not currency you exchange for forgiveness. People are allowed to be mad or distrust you even after you've apologized. It's less about being an asshole, but people just needing different things. Be sad but don't be mad about it."
ahhuhm,"YTA for stringing him along. Sure, he’s free to pursue other women, but some people can’t fall in love with two people at the same time, and if he’s caught up on you, he may not be able to develop feelings for someone else. "

ahio30,Go on over to r/childfree you aren't alone nor are you an asshole 
ahiqz3,"YTA. I was homeless as a teenager. Libraries were some of the only safe spaces where we could also be treated as people. That's so rare. 

 As a minority  I've also heard ""well I didn't mean all Hispanics"" or ""oh, not the ones like you"" to recognize it as a dog whistle for someone's prejudice. If homelessness bothers you consider what you are doing to make it better rather than trying to push these people out of view. "

ahiv3s,NTA You are not obligated to take the shift.  You have reasons
ahix9y,NTA  She sounds possessive and scary as hell.  If someone makes you afraid to answer/look at your phone then they aren’t someone you should be spending your time with.  Also I advise against contacting her again.  You don’t need that anxiety in your life.
ahj1ik,"NTA I believe that if you are severely disabled or ill and will never get better that you should have the option for assisted suicide. While I agree that being thrown out of a plane or into a volcano would be badass, I would opt for a more humane way like lethal injection "

Bdsm is built on trust and respect. Getting blackout drunk is not trust nor is it respect.

He can either 


a) keep it as his fantasy, 

B) you can role play by literally laying there.

If he starts forcing the idea, he needs therapy. "
ahjdx8,NTA - You explained to your boyfriend how this makes you uncomfortable yet he let him in. I would ask your Bf if he knew he wanted to buy stuff off you. If he did then your bf is the asshole. If not then it's just a miscommunication. This guy needs to be told to respect boundaries or he isn't welcome. 
ahjhfg,YTA. You seem to be relying on someone else’s failure to make you a success. You should be able to make your self successful without relying on someone else. Work harder to get the client in the first place instead of waiting for one to be given to you. 
ahjjk7,"YTA

Ever heard of revenge porn? Because you likely just shared some. But even if that wasn't the case it's really a dick move to pass that around the workplace and shame her for it.

Also I'm calling bullshit on the 'just randomly in conversation' bit unless you and your friends regularly discuss your fapping habits."
ahjp2v,"NTA, the other commenter said you're partially an asshole for ruining the other restaurant-goers' dinners, but IMO it was worth ruining one night for strangers to get that off your chest.

And it kinda feels good to do it in public and be all dramatic... Not that I'm suggesting that for future confrontations, but in this situation I think it was warranted.

Absolutely do not, under any circumstances, apologize to your shitty family members."
ahjse6,ESH - He sucks for cheating. You suck for eyeballing her while they were together. Yikes. 
ahjvv5,NTA move out. There’s so many red flags in how your bf ignores your wishes and desires. Let him live with his dad and gtfo.
ahjwzf,"NTA, super weird and clingy of your friend to make a request like that after meeting the girl *once* and her not even liking him. "
ahk8ay,"YTA. Don’t wish death (or in this case a faster death) on somebody just because you don’t like them. You should not need to be told that. Nobody’s saying you have to take a newfound liking to the guy, or even mourn his passing. Just try to be better than you’re being. "
ahkcej,"ESH. Your group of friends sound like pricks but you should've told your best friend how you felt before this even happened (and established whether you were actually friends with the group or not).

ahku65,"YTA. Of course her setting a limit is a little irrational but you were annoying the crap out of her. She didnt want to deal with your spam. She tried to do something so that you could still talk to her but wouldn't be able to bloat her inbox, and you couldn't do it for a single day. You are being completely inconsiderate. She said she couldn't text you. You didnt listen. She said text her less. You didn't listen.

 Stop texting her. Let her text you when she wants to. You dont need to try to initiate a conversation eight times a day. Go at her pace for once or she is never going to feel like ""catching up"" and you're going to lose the friendship "
ahkz5m,"NTA: You’re not in the wrong, he was being shady and you caught him. He did admit it was to check out old ex’s which isn’t cool. Maybe he is flirting. I wouldn’t take those kind of promises to heart. You have every right to be upset."
ahl05u,"NTA, your family is toxic. I know the expression is blood is thicker than water but good quality maple syrup is thicker than blood so F* your family and go have pancakes. (yes, I am Canadian)

ahnzsn,"YTA. Your girlfriend has turned this into a legitimate way to make money, and you're being condescending and dismissive by calling it a ""hobby"" and you're clearly distrustful of her. Attractive women are going to be hit on no matter what the situation; if you're going to date her, being insecure and trying to control her just to avoid the actions of others isn't fair to her, unless she's given you a reason to doubt her ability to remain faithful to you (which it doesn't sound like she has, and even then, being controlling isn't the right way to address it).

Edit for additional advice: If you keep acting in a way that says: ""I'm afraid I'm not good enough and someone else that's better will come along for my girlfriend,"" you'll eventually convince her that that's the truth."
aho0zu,NTA.  Getting blocked for trying to help your family doing the sensible thing.  This shouldn't as common as it is.

You can even turn it into a teaching moment if you take them to volunteer in the morning and then to a nice lunch and movie or whatever they want to do :) "

It would be different if it were a romance novel or something to fulfill an emotional need that relates to your orientation, but this is fantasy. In all likelihood you will end up enjoying the story and seeing marginalized characters as just humans who like different things. 

I haven’t read the series myself yet but I have heard it’s really good. I really dislike wanton rape in fiction but I still blasted through Game of Thrones and got mad there wasn’t more.

ahrvva,"ESH he has no right to threaten you or do anything thats just silly. But he didnt try to ""take advantage of you while you were sleeping"". Your employee asked you how much for the table and you told her the price. He didnt do anything. And if you were the consumer in the situation you would be upset as well if you were told one price and then when you go to pay for it they suddenly say its 700 more. Surely you can see why he might have been upset. But eh. You live you learn."
ahs02i,"NTA you didnt cut contact with them, and gave them multiple opportunities, it can seem a bit too strict but in the end its your daughter, and they have eroded away your trust in themin the aspect of leaving her alone with them, and you didnt go to the extreme of bot letting them see her or anything, you just dont want her unsupervised with them. In the end they just have to regain your trust, but thats their responsibility, yours is to protect your daughter. "

ahs8r1,"YTA. All she did is ask for one night to herself. Pregnancy is extremely taxing and you already have a toddler, of course she wants a night alone before the baby comes. Listening to the toddler around the house while you're trying to ""relax"" is not relaxing. A hot bath in a hotel room alone is. What's one night and like $100 to the woman putting her body and mind through having your child. You seem really selfish. "

ahsyoo,"NAH, as long as you are open to hearing his side of things. Wanting to be there so he doesn’t miss important family milestones is a valid reason, and so is wanting to help your family out of a tough situation. Somewhere between lies the solution - hopefully something closer to home. Sending lots of luck your way, this sort of thing is never easy. "

ahthpi,"NTA. She's in a shitty situation with the shutdown, but as soon as it came into play she should have cut costs right back. There's absolutely no reason to be spending on non-essential items during this period. For her to do so and then expect that you'll cover her share is unacceptable and disrespectful. The fact that the reason you're living with her in the first place was to help her cover bills makes this whole arrangement stink of her taking advantage of you."

To be honest going into this read from the title had me leading to a ""you are"".

However, I don't understand why he would ask to show you and then blow up off of a simple point you were making.

I'm jumping to conclusions, but it sounds like there is something else going on here with him. Don't know what it could be, but he's on edge.

Shit, if he wants to do the trip alone for 3 weeks tell him to just suck it up and do it. You don't want to hear him complain when you talk to him while he's ""venturing"" alone "

ahud8t,nta. It is an issue of morality and if it is something you don't agree with you should be able to feel uncomfortable by it. 
ahues1,nta. seems like she was trying to hide stuff from you and if it was a big enough issue to break up over then that's your decision and no one else's. if the trust wasn't there on either end it was just going to happen eventually.

ahultx,Ok so without getting into any judgement... Why are you getting married to her if you cant even hang with friends/family without making her upset about it?
ahv0xm,[deleted]
ahvaiu,YTA for expecting validation for a small gesture.  You're too caught up in wanting your validation instead of recognizing that people are too busy grieving to care about you.  Leave your ex and her family alone.
ahvd9n,"YTA. People change, plain and simple. Especially at the point in life you two are at. Especially when big, stressful things happen. You basically told her that she handled dealing with whatever she was dealing with wrong because she didn’t talk to you. You made her problems about you. You two were close but she doesn’t owe you an explanation of everything going on in her life unless she wants to tell you, regardless of what she’s decided to tell you in the past. "

She's a damn adult.  She can make her own decisions.  

I am a bit confused about the timeline though.  You said your ""wife"" knew about the job interview but you guys didn't have much of a future because you weren't together?  So you guys weren't married?"

1-

What's wrong with saying ""I'm sorry. I see that my comment bothered you. Since I understand this, I won't make similar comments in the future"" ?

If you still want to discuss your point of view with your sister, wait for a suitable moment when the two of you can have a private and friendly conversation about it.

2-

Your sister could have handled the situation in a better way. She should have had a private and friendly conversation with you to solve the issue.

3-

The boyfriend should have stayed out of it at least until you and your sister had the chance to solve the issue among yourselves.

4-

Your other sister brought a questionable argument and then started crying when you disagreed with her.

5-

You believe that talking about disagreements is about ""winning"" instead of solving issues and improving relationships.

6-

You refused to talk to your parents when they disagreed with you.

7-

Your sister started yelling and demanding that you start talking to her when you refused to talk to her.

Drama and more drama.

----------------------------------------

Suggestions:

Learn to apologize.

Forget about ""winning"".  Focus on improving relationships and being happier.

Stop giving people the ""silent treatment"". If you need time to calm down, let them know. If you would like to reschedule the conversation, ask them to do so."
ahwp3l,"NTA because apologies are never obligatory to be accepted.

in this case it sounds like the apology was given because he was caught rather than feeling sorry.

My mother always said that you should never apologize unless you feel bad for what you did AND you don't intend on perpetrating something like that again.

If neither of those criteria are met then the apology is not real and should not be given. And if the apology is given it should not be accepted by the person affected.

In any situation, you aren't obligated to accept an apology for an invasion of privacy.


On the other hand.... Practical jokes can be funny at times.... But you need the proper kind of relationship for that. 

Still, NTA"
ahwrol,"NTA. Your feelings are your feelings. And from what youve described, it makes sense youd be hurt. Youve been told at various points in your life to expect this help. And now theyre going back on that. Who knows why they did, Im not going to speculate on that. But if I promised you a puppy for years and then when it came time to deliver the puppy I gave you a stuffed dog instead, youd be hurt, right?


That being said, try to not let it get to you. It was smart of you to not be relying on them for this downpayment. Youre doing well on your own, and even though it IS unfair, you ARE doing well. A house is a big accomplishment! Congratulations. "
ahwwfg,"YTA but don't worry, the choice you made at 13 when you can't be blamed for not making a mature and sensible choice, will probably affect the rest of your life 

You screwed yourself and your mum here and I bet she had much more concern about your education than her good life 

You live and learn OP, at 13 you get an asshole pass from me 



"
ahwwwm,"NTA

You went out of your way to help them by even coming in at all. Imo they're very rude and unprofessional. What if you had a medical issue you didn't want to disclose..?

This wouldn't happen at either of my jobs. If it did I'd call them out or ignore them, depending on details. "
ahwy98,"YTA. Holy fuck man, what is wrong with you?

Thinking you like a girl is fine, we can't control that. But I mean:

""Don't get me wrong, Engineering is great and everything, but compared to medicine, I really can't see a relationship working between the two of them. She does not think the same though, constantly talking about how much she loves him, they even moved in together and plan a future together. As stupid as it might sound, but *I think I know better than her and know that she would be happier with me in the end*, both of us working in the same field, on a similar intellectual level.""

""I know best for her"" is what you're saying- you're being controlling and you haven't even started a relationship with this girl (thank God).

Jealously can suck, sure, and not being with someone you care about can suck too. But I mean, just because YOU think two people aren't good for each other, that don't mean jack shit. My girlfriend is a linguist and I suck at languages and am into arms control. Yet we're two peas in a pod, and if someone at the school she teaches at tried to get her to break up with me because he liked languages, she'd be royally pissed at him and probably not talk to him again.

And that's what you'd be doing. You're going to destroy your friendship with this girl completely, because as you say, she talks about him all the time, loves him, lives with him, and wants a future with him.

Respect that. If you actually care about her, you'll respect that, because she's made it clear where she stands.

God, holy shit, I'm getting almost irrationally angry the more I type this. What a fucking asshole you are. There should be a YTFA option, because it'd fit you to a motherfucking T.

""…but I know it's the best for both of us.""

Seriously man? Go fuck yourself."

ahxmwd,"NTA - and to be honest, I wonder why you seem to be bearing the brunt of all this change.

Does he know how exhausted you are? There isn't a communication gap here? If he knows, then he needs to adapt. The fact his expectations haven't changed now the kid is around, and you are exhausted but he isn't, suggests that you've made all the necessary changes but he hasn't.

Something's really off here though - your last paragraph suggests that you've said no but that he just doesn't get why.

Are you guys really communicating here? He shouldn't need you to spell everything out for him, but are you being explicit about your needs?

FWIW he sounds tone deaf and unhelpful with the baby."
ahxokw,"ESH. She sucks for playing both of you.  You suck for letting her after you found out. You dont suck for being tricked.  If you really like this girl and want a chance then wait until she is ready and dating you is enough.

ahxtsd,[deleted]
ahxwv1,"YTA. I can not agree more with your friend especially when she said something about your “intense desperation.” She offered you good advice even after she clearly stated she didn’t want to be involved and then you kept looping her back into this conversation that she didn’t want to have. You said her advice wasn’t the support you wanted, but you didn’t want support you wanted validation. And here you are on this sub seeking more validation! You need to stop trying to contact the friend you had a falling out with and just drop it cause it sounds like that ship has sunk. The friend you are messaging deserves an apology and then you need to give them space and to not contact them at inappropriate hours just so you can air your personal bullshit. They mentioned in the text you do this often and it makes them feel under appreciated. I think you also need to go speak with a counsellor about your obsessive behaviour. "
ahxy4z,"NTA

It's definitely her responsibility as the boy's mother to teach him proper hygiene. It's something the kid has to learn to do anyway. If he doesn't want to be made fun of, he'll learn eventually. 

But. It seems like this relationship is pretty permanent. That means you could potentially be the boy's stepfather. If that's the case you should take more than zero responsibility for him."
ahxzgi,"NTA. Judging by your post history, you can do better and this guy isn’t worth the stress. "
ahy02f,YTA to me cigarette smoke is similar to noise issues. If it's affecting other people's enjoyment of their apartment then you are doing something wrong. 
ahy17n,NTA. She is just saying you are a creep to take the heat off herself for cheating. 
ahy4wl,"Depression and insomnia are conditions that he cant really control. Its hard for us outsiders to understand because we cant quite grasp it because its ""invisible"". If it is any help, imagine he lost an arm and you are getting upset that he cant carry two grocery bags like other can. Doesn't make sense and you know that because you can see he only has 1 arm.i hope my analogy is somewhat understandble. 

NAH "
ahy8bm,NTA. I'm not sure how you could think you were the asshole here. You gave your friend multiple attempts and methods to help you find him. He refused. You went home. I would've done the same.
ahyid9,"YTA. You committed a crime. You have no proof that she did anything wrong. You are not a police officer. You had *NO BUSINESS* to do what you did.

BTW... rabbits can squeeze through the tiniest of openings to get basically anywhere if they so choose."
ahynn8,"NTA but your daughter is confused. Take her to therapy, counseling or a support group for families of drug addicts. Reaching out to other families sharing the same experiences can really help you and your daughter."
ahyqdt,"NTA.  Ask a question at the end of your comments to him, so they ""require a response.""  Something like, ""Does that make sense?"" or, ""You understand?"" "
ahz1kn,"YTA. But, I might consider the same thing. I'd only do it out of spite (hence me being an asshole) because I would realize that that money is gone and that I would never see it, and that his GF/fiancee would take his side. 

If you don't want to be an asshole, don't contact her. It wouldn't do any good anyway."
ahz6fg,"NTA.

Even if it was a trained animal, you don't know this animal. Plus, what if your child turns out allergic to pet dander?  

That puppy is without a doubt going to bite or scratch someone, because that's what puppies do, and will get all the blame despite the stupid owner being to fault. "
ahz7t0,Yeah... I'm gonna go with probably some missing pieces to this story dude
ahztf9,"NTA. Your brother is in a tough spot, but he is a grown man who needs to get his priorities in order.

It’s not your responsibility to provide him housing or to deal with his lack of cleanliness and financial discipline. "
ahzvph,Just drop it. 
ahzys5,"ESH .  Doing a little math here (5 months pregnant, you started sleeping with her when she just got pregnant,  and estranged from her husband for 2 months)...  You helped a pregnant woman cheat on her husband.  I think you are all assholes and the only one I feel sorry for is this child."
ai01z7,"NTA. Sounds like Sam and Jennifer are the assholes. They led Joyce on and pushed both of you towards something, at least, you weren’t ready for. "
ai05y1,"NTA, they sound abusive and I'm sorry you have to deal with that"
ai07jd,"NTA, sounds like she's trying to take advantage of you and your dad honestly.

I never recommend doing the weird ""you pay X bill and I'll pay Y bill and we'll split Z bill and maybe it'll even out in the end"" junk though. You're right on your final conclusion - just split everything 50/50. In fact, a mature independent adult would want to *minimize* the amount a parent is subsidizing their lifestyle, not take advantage of them."
ai08lw,NTA. if you can afford it leave. He's your brother not you son. You have to live your life sometime. And seems you didn't have much of a childhood anyway. 
ai0a6q,"I'm not talking about a full blown conversation, or even stuff that doesn't even have to do with the movie. It just very small comments ""Oh that was pretty fun"" or like ""wow can't believe that happen"". Pretty sure when you are in a small gathering with your friends, someone has atleast made comments here or there in the movie. Yea i can understand to not talk during a movie, but if someone has already seen the movie, you would feel like maybe they put it on to maybe atleast talk to you dont you think? "
ai0ld4,"NTA.  Taking creep shots of his ex is a gross thing to do in the first place, let alone blaming that it was ""hard to let go"".  Red flag."

Good luck"
ai19en,"NAH- a couple things I see going on here

1. Have you considered that she is trying to bring you out of your shell? If she is, then talk to her about other ways you can be active.
2. You don't enjoy skiing and that's perfectly fine. Kinda sucks that she is just ignoring you :/
3. My advice- try to find other ways you can be more active and with your family and less introverted. It will boost your self confidence and health."
ai1a34,"No a holes here

You're just annoyed at an annoying situation .I hope things work out ,I know how hard it is to work  with people with autism. Ive worked with some (in a halfway house sort of way) and it can be very challenging. I also have 2 sibs with autism.try finding out what your coworkers obsession is (a lot if autistics have something they obsess about ),  try relating work to there obsession."
ai1fiw,"YTA.

I just don't get why it's a big deal that he has an ex that lives nearby. People have to live somewhere. Do you suspect him of having an ongoing relationship with her? If not, I don't get the anger.

As for the potential stalking, talk to your BF about it. He probably doesn't even know. If you think the white car is her, ask him what type of car she has."
ai1i0m,"NTA for being weirded out and concerned for your fiances safety. Guy sounds like a sleazeball. However, YTA for saying she can't go. That's controlling behavior and she's a grown woman, you don't have the right to tell her what she can and cannot do. Don't blame you for being nervous but there was a much better way to approach this. "
ai1pzo,"NTA for being annoyed at him, especially because he tried to hide it. You told him many times to be more careful with this set and he should have been. It's probably not worth being angry for a really long time, because they are just things even if you like them a lot, but your initial reaction is totally justified."
ai20t8,NTA.  It's not appropriate for him to be sharing information with friends about your sex life without your consent.  
ai21ey,"NTA, you're friends are out of their minds. Go buy an xbox and tell them they each owe you $100."
ai24vj,"NTA. It's sounds like you were kind and didn't scold the child, and people need to learn to control (or at least watch) their kids when in stores. "
ai2588,"YTA.

If you don't agree with her choice you should leave her. You giving her an ultimatum in my opinion is a terrible thing to do. 

Can you imagine how well this would play out if you forced her to keep a baby she did not want?"
ai25rp,"YTA. Your ex had tried talking to you about your relationship issues and you won't talk. So she ran it past her support system which is 100% normal and valid. She wasn't shit-talking, she said she feels like you are uninterested. Because you act uninterested. 

You sound like a real treat. This is a blessing in disguise for your ex."
ai27g6,"ESH.  You never mentioned to your GF that you made these plans with your co-worker until that day...obviously it seems like you are hiding something - because if your GF knew you were going with a co-worker prior to messaging you that she was coming down, maybe she wouldn't have tried to come, booked an earlier train to join you - etc.  

Granted, her behavior also sucks, you both need to learn how to communicate more clearly!"
ai2c5h,"YTA. Not because you rejected an advance, but because of your attitude and this...

> that now that I have the ability to reject people,

Yup. Asshole."
ai2la2,"YTA. You knew before hand that he wouldn’t be okay with it and intentionally made the decision without talking to him first because you knew what he would say. 

I understand that this is family but that doesn’t mean you get to make unilateral decisions that affect both of you. "
ai2m5h,"NAH, but it's not hard to describe a fade to a stylist.  You can ask your girlfriend to help you find photos to show the stylist.  "
ai2qyu,"I would not call you an ass hole, but I would say that he’s not interested and you should probably stop trying to pursue an intimate relationship with him. Sorry :/ "
ai2siv,"NTA, but also, do you really like this guy enough to mother him this way?  I don't mean to be a downer, but I wish someone had asked me that when I was mothering the shit out of one of my exes, who would literally buy new underwear every week so he didn't have to do laundry, and then never came up with his half of the rent."
ai2sng,"NTA, but I think you should tell his pregnant wife.  It's horrible, but she deserves to know what's been going on so she can decide how she wants to handle it.  It'll hurt her even more if she ever finds out you knew and said nothing."
ai2xw4,"Definitely NTA. If you want people to be there for you, show them that they mean something in your life *before* you want something from them. If you don't want to go, the best way to do it is to respectfully turn it down without getting too confrontational."
ai3456,"NAH. I think your parents just need to have more solid communication. You're not an asshole for standing up for your mother, but your dad's also not an asshole for being upset. I think it's all just been blown a bit out of proportion."
ai39dr,"NAH. Yeah living with roommates often sucks, even if they're good ones, were u all living in one room or was it like a dorm with a common kitchen and bathroom?"
ai3drn,"Sometimes YTA but usually NTA: just cause you’re refusing to ever watch anything with her. I honestly feel like this is a communication problem since you both have very different viewing styles. She probably doesn’t understand why you won’t, and you’ll have to explain to her in a way that both of you respect one another.

Relationships are about understanding one another, and about occasionally compromising. Maybe ask her to limit her questions to the end of the episode and make a mental list to ask you later. If she’s doing it in the cinema obnoxiously, then she’s the asshole. At home, set up some guidelines but don’t flat out refuse to watch stuff with her since that takes out a big chunk of spending time together from my experience."
ai3frp,"YTA. You felt hurt that she ""excluded"" you (though I disagree), but when she invited you, you passive-aggressively said ""it doesn't work like that."" How exactly *does* it work, then? Stop being so milquetoast and tell her what you want."
ai3ky8,"NTA, but watch what you say.  Stay professional.  You're not speaking to your boss because she's disabled, you're letting your boss know that you can't take on the responsibility of caring for this employee.  You are taking on the brunt of the work because Robin refuses to do it, and you need assistance from your boss with how to handle the situation."
ai3t9t,"NAH, but pressuring him clearly isn't what's going to help improve his mood or rekindle his past passion. Plus, he might have simply lost interest, as people often do with their hobbies. "
ai43lb,"Oh for pity's sake,  let the kid have some goodies from Grandma.  Is this really the hill you want to die on?"
ai4el9,"YTA. They're both in the same friend group as you are, and they just broke up three weeks ago, which is very recent. Making a move on her would be incredibly disrespectful to GB.
"
ai4k7p,"YTA

She didn't have to ask you because you don't live there and she didn't ask you to pay for it. "
ai4lye,"YTA.

Judge other’s choices in silence unless asked for your opinion. Life will teach them one way or another, and your comments will only build resentment towards you.

ai4mqb,"NAH. She’s whistling to get their attention, it’s a sound they know and recognize. But, I definitely understand why it annoys you

ai4pe2,"NTA. She sounds like she has issues. I hope this isn’t a SHP, but it kind of seems like one..."
ai4piq,"this is barely readable

hopefully your final is not in writing"
ai4pmc,"NTA - Your dad sounds very dramatic and self indulgent. 

He is the one who said he would watch the game elsewhere. You just agreed. Silly. "
ai4xkj,"NTA. It's your choice if you want kids.

But that might end up being a deal breaker. Thats just reality with that kind of thing. There isnt really a solution to you two wanting different end games for your lives"
ai4y5k,"NTA, if she gets into an accident, you guys are on the hook.  And it is worse on an expired license, as your insurance may not cover it. "
ai57hb,"NTA but you could easily avoid any trouble by just saying she wasn't your type, not bringing up race even if pressured."
ai5d91,NTA.  But you friend seems to be. She blocked you because you put your work before her party? Wow. You’re an adult who put work before partying all weekend. No problem there. It’s not like this party was down the street. We’re talking about different states. Your friend owes you an apology for being a childish ass. 
ai5k40,"NTA, but the husbands are. Like you've said you need to make a living and what goes on in your clients life isn't your problem. The only thing you need to worry about is your safety and getting your money. Just don't be too surprise if you get slapped by angry wives every now and then."
ai5nar,"NTA for ghosting a predator who stole money from you.  Stay safe, OP.  You don't owe him a fart."
ai5ogh,"NTA. If the restaurant put it on the menu, how could it possibly be “disrespectful” to order it? "
ai5vkk,"ESH. 

Everyone should of signed papers at the start of living there. 

She sucks for using her anxiety as an excuse to life and buying a cat even though knowing someone’s allergic 

"
ai60ge,"NTA - You have a valid point for hating him. But I don’t think you’ll be able to make your mom understand, sadly. You should talk to your dad about this, too (if you are comfortable and on good terms with him). But you know, if your mom is going to be like that, maybe she might have to lose her daughters to understand as cruel as it is."
ai69m5,"ESH. He’s the asshole for being inconsiderate like you said, but you’re alsp at fault for not communicating at all. According to the story you didn’t even tell him its time to leave! Also, you said you haven’t talked to it for a month afterwards and you’re still mad. That honestly seems unhealthy, you need to talk things out."
ai69nw,NTA. They had to learn some time that being annoying little shits would catch up with them.
ai69qt,"NTA, they need to control their fucking kid"
ai6ec0,"NTA; first of all she has way to many kids (doesn't necessarily make her an asshole, but still). Second of all, kids aint supposed to be running around in a commemorative event for a dead loved one, especially if knocking stuff over. Her statement that you aren't allowed to confront her children is inherently wrong, as a flawed parent can use this excuse if said excuse is accepted by the public, and have full freedom to shittily raise their children."
ai6n9s,Haha dude you know YTA why even come to Reddit
ai6y9h,"YTA. And it's all for one reason: Tact. You had none of it. She wants to learn cooking and it's going to take time and effort. Gordon Ramsey didn't get to where he is now without a few bad dishes along the way.

You didn't want her feelings hurt if your family doesn't eat her cooking, fine. Let her down easy and encourage her. Tell her that she can do better and she should bring her A game to impress the family. What you did was inconsiderate and her reaction was hardly unjustified"
ai708e,"Nta. Women who cry rape and it's fake make it so much harder for women who've actually been raped and try to get their rapist prosecuted.

You did the right thing by calling her out. If you have proof he couldn't possibly have raped her you owed it to him to bring it out.

Were the police involved? She can't just make public accusations about that. You might want to ask r/legal advice for help on that. "
ai7h0u,"NTA. You talked about the issues with her and you gave her plenty of opportunities for her to pull her weight around your place. It's unfortunate she's going through a tough time, but you and your other roommate shouldn't have to suffer through it out of guilt."
ai7qdd,"Because men aren’t mind readers. It’s easy to misinterpret a few subtle signals. What is ‘clearly’ to you, may not have been to him. "
ai7ryt,"ESH- It seems that you had good intentions until later on. Your ex-best friend is an asshole because they handled it poorly. You are an asshole as well (I really don't mean that as an insult it's just the sub reddit) because you acted a bit too controlling. You tried giving advice, but you took it a bit too far."
ai7sxj,NTA you can lead a horse to water but you can't force it to drink : If he had the resources to quite and chose not to. That's not anyones fault. And Sympathy is given to those who deserves. it not everyone deserves it and you are the only one who can determine who gets your sympathy  
ai7tmt,[deleted]
ai7ty0,"Man, this one's hard, but maybe ESH. Everyone had stuff to do to prep for school starting, and I assume you're all old enough to manage yourselves and be responsible for your own luggage and finances and finding your own way around. Depending on how close you were with these friends (you say ""close"" but are talking, sibling close, trust-them-with-your-life close?), I'd say they were more shit, but maybe you could have also been more understanding of the fact that they were also in a foreign country and needed time.

B was definitely an asshole if she said she'd help you and then turned around and said she meant something completely different. "
ai85co,"NAH.

I don't think home assistants are automatically set to record their surroundings at all times, but it's fine if you don't want it in your shared rooms, since you also have a say in it.

But this whole matter is just a matter of preference, and i wouldn't say anyone is the asshole (unless your roomies are dissing you and being mean because of this preference then you're NTA and they're TA)

Take care and i hope it gets resolved❤️"
ai86hm,NTA as long as you enjoy it in your head don't act like one.
ai88ja,"NTA. Though it isn't effective to describe their behaviour and relationship as ""weird"" when talking to him (even though it sounds fucking nuts). It's likely to make him clam up and get defensive. It's enough to say that it makes you uncomfortable. If he doesn't respect you enough to listen and try to work to meet your needs, it isn't worth it for you to stay. You can do better. "
ai8cqb,"Wait so both your bf AND the owner of the house grabbed you by the throat and the owner of the house, your friend, threw you on, what (I’m on mobile can’t see) ice?

GET AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. FORGET WHETHER OR NOT YOUR AN ASSHOLE. THEY LAID HANDS ON YOU"
ai8de9,"NTA - If someone is an asshole, tell them

ai8mce,"NTA, the guy went ahead, I dunno how you were supposed to know that that was his family he left behind.  The dude was unnecessarily confrontational and also touched you without permission.  Guy's a jerk.  You weren't rude and I don't think you should wait when someone is clearly going to take a long time to get off, just because they're in the row in front.  If they're pretty much ready to go then yeah, let 'em go.  If they're not, they can go when they're ready."
ai8rmp,"Did you mention trying to get her a job there to her first? If not, yta."
ai8rnu,"NTA, having depression and anxiety aren't symptoms that randomly encourage cheating. 

She's cheating, plain and simple, because she's a cheater and is making up excuses as to why.

I would document everything e.g. text messages, emails, etc and consult a divorce attorney asap to make sure that your daughter is protected. "
ai8tdx,"You’re NTA, but you are being a bit sanctimonious (seemingly) all of a sudden. If this guy’s behavior really offends you to this extent, I am not sure why you remain fiends. Him doing this to girlfriend is not really much different than him doing this to his wife in many respects. "

aiabdo,"NTA,  but talk to your sister so she knows she can lean on you in times like this. You obviously had nobody to lean on, and that sucks, don't allow the same thing to happen to your sister. It sounds like your parents are unreasonable,  your sister probably knows that."

aiaprd,"I disagree with everyone posting here. NTA.

From my perspective we have precious little time in this world and if someone is going to treat me that way that aren't getting any of my time. I wouldn't bring my children around someone like that either. I'm sorry there's just no way what he did was unintentional. You keep sticking up for yourself. "
aiarhn,"YTA

Let them handle their grief however they need to. If you need support from them co-attendance of a funeral isn't the only way to receive or give support.   Don't pressure people to handle a death how you think they should based either on your own perspective or societal ettiqute. 

I am sorry for your loss. I lost my best friend from childhood at age 16 in a car accident so I particularly feel for you."
aiav0g,"YTA. FFS you are like a dog with 2 bones. 

You don't want to be with her because she has been with him. 

You don't want him to be with her. You want to be their friends. 

You think your best friend is using her yet you are the one sleeping with her after breaking it off. Looks like you are the user.

You think she is using him to get over you, so tell him and let him work it out. "
aiawtz,"No A-holes here. I get that you’re trying to help her and I think that’s great. It could be that she feels self conscious at the gym or hates that she’s unfit compared to what she used to do and that’s ruined her enjoyment. I’ve been there. You’re in a no win situation unfortunately as if you didn’t encourage her then you’re not being supportive, if you do she feels like you want her to lose weight. Hopefully she will be able to see this in time and will start coming with you and enjoying it!"
aib46w,"NTA, but do you really want an adult child as your roommate?  The guy can't manage to make tea.  If he can't do that, how is he supposed to be able to wipe down a counter or ever scrub a toilet?  You don't need to put yourself in a position to be his new mom because you think he needs to fly free."
aib5ly,"YTA This quote says it all:

> I think all these factors (her family, my family, me (I'd like to think I'm a pretty considerate person but who knows if I added to her stress)) kinda burnt her out and she needed time.

You knew that your friend was having a hard time, and rather than offering support and help, you ditched her. You're a shit friend. "
aiba2q,NTA - You paid for the seats. They should have moved in the first place. 
aibasp,"NTA. And I don’t think you understand how a birthday party works. They put it on for you, you’re the guest and they server you food and drinks.  

And regarding the kids and the mess... your house, your rules. They can learn to respect your authority. And by “they”, I’m including the adults.  

BTW, happy birthday 👍😁"
aibiat,"NTA. Maybe if your boss wants to go against your agreed schedule, they should run it by you first. Communication does fucking wonders. "
aiblyv,"NTA, but not really sure why you even considered giving her another chance when a bad end result was bound to happen."
aic12w,"NTA.  It's unethical, but your family's stability is more important.  Just make sure to give them proper notice."
aic301,"NTA.  She needs to be able to make friends over her own life, not using information about yours.  Parents definitely talk about their kids, but your scores are your business."
aicbvp,YTA. Eat your leftover fish cold or at home; don't make everyone else put up with the smell.
aicet9,"NTA on the condition that you don’t complain if it’s delayed getting to you..

EDIT: 
And that they have accepted your order"
aicez1,"ESH. You have to remember she's still a *child*. She's learnt this behaviour from somewhere, more than likely your mother. Hating her isn't going to fix anything. You're 21. She's 12. If you can, try to steer her away from this behaviour, because it is going to be extremely damaging to everyone involved if this behaviour continues."
aicm5p,"NTA. In this case, it's best to stay impartial since there's no winning, and if you were to voice your support either way, they could claim favoritism and it would just blow up in your face worse. They're the assholes for both their behavior towards each other and for putting you in the middle of this."
aicty6,"ESH

She's an a-hole for cheating on you, obviously. But if you agreed to paying rent for both of you, you can't just take that back now and create a ""debt"" that was never there. You should have made a different kind of agreement from the beginning."
aicuk2,"YTA. 

It's a gift from her to you. She gets to choose. You get to choose what you give to other people. You sound spoiled."
aicv2u,"YTA. You need to get yourself some real help. She has told you repeatedly she doesn’t want you, love you or appreciate your advances yet you keep forcing it on her. You went so far as to tell her you would kill yourself for her. That is an awful thing to do to someone else to try and force their hand. Leave her alone and get some help."
aiczu8,"NTA. Not sure if he was doing anything to be concerned about but you certainly have the right to end things. It sounds like you were really expecting him to screw up all along, though, and took the first chance to ditch. Trust your gut and don’t head down a road with someone you truly don’t trust. "
aid0tg,"YTA

Not for having these issues, but honestly if you can’t cope with these things, living with a roommate isn’t for you. (Glitter? Really?? Unless she dumped a container of glitter all over the floor, I doubt this was this much of an issue) Unless she was cooking an absolutely absurd amount of bacon, there is no way it could be all over all of these surfaces. (Oven, coffee pot.) you need to learn to Co-exist, or reconsider having a roommate at all.

EDIT: or, find a roommate that fits these habits. I can’t imagine having a roommate who isn’t satisfied after cleaning a pan twice. (And in most apartments, there just isn’t room for two sets of things like basic cookware.)"
aidaqu,"ESH.

Holding a parking spot by standing in it is a dick move. Especially in the kind of busy, downtown environment that you’re talking about. So that couple are assholes.

You’re also an asshole because 1) you should *NEVER* use your vehicle as a tool to get someone to move out of your way. That’s totally reckless and dangerous. If someone is blocking you, then just keep driving. It’s sucks, but oh well. Betting than killing someone. 2) Just because someone else is acting like an asshole and screaming at you doesn’t automatically mean that you have to start yelling back. Be the bigger person next time and just smile, nod, and move on. "
aidb58,"It sounds to me like your only good relationship is your current boyfriend, and that re-joining with your old circle or even just the one guy in it would be an incredibly bad place. YTA- because he's trying to look out for you, and you're calling him ""toxic"" for trying to have your best interests in mind."
aidrtj,"NTA.

Your neighbor is kind of a weirdo, and you should just disregard him completely."
aidv5z,"NTA. This is coming from someone who is a huge dog lover, and not fond of children. 

Your childs safety is your number 1 priority. You have the right to say no about anything you deem unsafe. Now, a shelter for the dog will almost certainly end with euthanasia. Perhaps finding a home more suitable to the dogs issues is the best idea. But its your ex so im assuming you arent living together and you just dont want the dog brought to your house which shouldn't be a big deal. Is this ex the father of the newborn?
"
aidwjc,"Validation seeking.  

I mean what, exactly, is the thing you could be an asshole for?  You got the girl gifts and she shit on you for it.  "
aiebk5,"ESH for sleeping with coworkers and then blabbering about it. So unprofessional. Don’t sleep with coworkers. If you do, for the love of God, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. These kinds of situations almost always go sour and can ruin your career. 

You’ve learned a valuable lesson here, OP. "
aiefng,"YTA for saving it and lying about it.

And you are still lying now , you kept it for a reason you are just denying it. "
aiejrm,"NTA. Both morally and legally, you're in the right."
aiewh8,YTA - not because of wanting to distance yourself from people who are frustrating (which is understandable) but because you make no mention of telling folks how you feel so they have a chance to make it right before you ghost them. 
aieyrm,"NTA 

This is exhausting. Demanding someone time two weekends in a row is pretty outrageous "
aif4gt,NTA. He can't depend on you for such simple everyday things.
aif5qg,"YTA, if you have no rational argument then you're refusing to not allow her to do it out of spite.

Let her change her name."
aif69u,[deleted]
aif74a,"YTA, can't decide if this is a shitpost, but I guarantee that a 6 year old knows quite well what, and how, you're saying things to him.

You sound like a monster. "
aifccm,"NTA. Personally, I think putting tampons in the kitchen trash is disgusting. They belong in the bathroom trash. It sounds like you're being responsible with wrapping things up. Could you maybe take over trash duty for the bathroom?"
aifr3w,"NTA, block him and move on. Stop reaching out, he's not your responsibility. Enjoy being with someone who treats you right. "
aifrnf,"NTA. I can think of no reason why she would buy a SECOND piñata and cake unless she wanted to show you up with a ""better"" piñata and cake. This is shitty. 

Does she do shit like this on a regular basis? If so, I highly recommend you visit /r/justnomil. They will have good advice for you. 

In the meantime, I'd serve the cake YOU bought and the piñata YOU bought. "
aift52,Nta. You took your car to be repaired. They didnt repair it. That bullshit about keeping it cheap is just an excuse. Any reputable shop will talk to you about your options. I would definitely ask for money back.
aig2dc,YTA. You attacked someone without real cause. If you were that worried you should have called the police or asked for help in the shop. 
aig5jz,NTA.  Your sister sounds very troubled.  Your dad defending her ridiculous behavior isn’t helping her. 
aigabg,"NTA, people always use the ""it's a joke"" thing so when they do something wrong they don't have to take responsibility. That's why I have a no joking rule for people who do that "
aigay6,"In Massachusetts, if you report this person to the police with video (dash cam or a passenger recorded) they get a ticket so I'd say you're ok"
aigdqj,"NTA. He clearly needs to learn to trust you. I'm a conservative myself but this is unnecessary and controlling, there's no reason for you to not hang around with whatever gender you like, especially since you stated you'd never acted unfaithful before."
aigkdk,NTA. He's not respecting something completely valid and not adhering to something so simple. He needs to grow up.
aigo6d,"NTA

Bro, u are getting treated like shit, Did you tell him you are leaving? Probably for the better you leave. Also I think it is the right decision even if it makes you look like an asshole."
aigqn5,"NTA But that bit about your feelings being your fault is...interesting. Did you point out all the highly visible chores that needed doing & did he continue to not do them?

&#x200B;"
aiguiu,"This. Part of being in a relationship at 15 is generally having no privacy. I wasn’t even allowed to have my boyfriend in my room at 15 (or 16 or even 17 if I remember correctly), much less with the door closed. 

It sucks that her brother is wild like that, but you just gotta deal. "
aigvaq,"NTA if you keep the cat primarily in your room. Also the litter box should be in a place that the roomie doesn’t have to smell it or anything. Also if the cat is trying to jump or lay on your roommate then you should get the cat away from him. Also, if he says no, then respect the decision because he isn’t the asshole if he doesn’t want the cat.  

I’d consider having it be an outside cat during the day and at night let it inside and sleep with you. "
aih81f,"NTA

>trying to steal her joy

That sounded veeeeery narcissistic."
aiha6o,"NTA. Your boyfriend is though. He likes the comfort, reliability and convenience of a bigger, newer car but isn’t interested in taking any responsibility for it? Pffft."
aihe1h,NTA. She tried to emotionally manipulate you and you backed away when it threatened to affect your mental health. That's a sensible course of action.
aiheco,"NAH. You're human for feeling the way you do. However, if she could fall out of love because shes around another guy (especially one shes known a long time) then you shouldnt be together. "
aihes0,"NTA. That’s a huge ask and the timing feels suspicious to me. You don’t have to loan your car to anyone you don’t want to for any reason you don’t want to, even if that person is paying for it as a gift, especially since you’re willing to take over the payments. "
aihh09,"NTA, good grief. What a ridiculous thing for her to get angry about! Totally unfair. "
aihln6,"NTA, but it also did come out poorly worded. ""I'm not mad if"" does come off like you already assumed she did it. I think maybe a slightly more subtle approach would be better.  

I am concerned why she's pulling out $1000 cash of a credit card. There would only be a few reasons to do that."
aihnvc,[deleted]
aihu8i,"NAH

Me time is important in relationships and establishing these things early on is important. But with that said, its easy to get carried away and leave the other feeling like they're an after thought or just get part of you when you make yourself available. In other words, find that medium where you dont sacrifice the relationship to your activities and you dont sacrifice yourself to the relationship."
aihwy0,"NTA. 

>dont worry, the guy I got drunk with and took into my room is out of my life

>refers to him as a friend

Run from this thot."
aii54o,"YTA just because of your reaction. 

It’s very obvious that the dude hid the fact he lost the iPad from you for a good reason. Your reaction is insane and he saw it coming. I would have hid it from you, too!

People lose things. It happens. Does it suck? Yea, of course it does. I can understand how you would feel a little disappointed that he lost it, but come on. Cut the guy some slack. He’s human. 

I lost a *diamond necklace* that my boyfriend got me for Christmas last year. I wore it every day and only took it off a handful of times. The last time, I lost it. I didn’t tell my bf for almost a month because I wanted to take the time to look *everywhere* for it before I truly considered it “lost”. I cried many tears over it and eventually told him. You know what he said? “It’s just a necklace!”. He didn’t want me to be upset about it. He didn’t see it as a waste of money. Shit happens. 

$500 is a lot of money. I get it. But an iPad is just a material item. Do you put material items over the people that you (supposedly) love?"
aii7k0,"NAH - you aren’t an asshole for having sound sensitivities, but kids do make happy noises at that age (I’m guessing 2-3 years old?) and there isn’t a ton that can be done about it. "
aii8at,"YTA. It’s not as though he hunted down the dog to kill and eat it. He was experiencing a different culture, and eating dog is a part of that culture. We eat beef as if it is not a big deal but in other cultures it is thought of as repulsive. You wanted to marry this guy but now you are acting as though he will kill and eat your pet when your not looking are you serious?? "
aii9zw,"NAH - you are both going through difficult times, hang in their and keep trying to do your best.  I'm sure she does understand, but is just going through a lot and frustrated."
aiifsw,"NTA

Assuming the other roommates are all following the program, he’s the odd man out. He needs to get with the program or pack up and move on."
aiijso,"Tbh I see both perspectives here but I’d say in this scenario you’re NTA. When you dad said he’d take you guys on vacation, it’s kind of shitty to make you drop a couple hundred more dollars than you’d originally intended because he had a bruised ego. I’d only say YTA  if you felt entitled to a vacation for no reason— but clearly there’s a reason here because he invited you to go. "
aiin0p,This is why relationships have 2 people
aiitoy,"YTA, I totally understand the fund issue but I would had done a joint gift for him and his fiance. "
aiiutg,"YTA I get that you don’t understand computers but it won’t just magically save your password. Your boyfriend tried to explain this to you and you didn’t trust him. 

How are you supposed to have a healthy, trusting relationship when you can’t even trust basic (not hard to understand) computer facts he’s giving you? 

It makes you seem suspicious and is just paving way for future issues. "
aiiw7p,[deleted]
aiizq8,"She snapped at him, and he snapped back. That seems fair to me. Maybe he should know what he shouldn't bring up, but it's not his responsibility to *know* that she wanted to vent without recieving advice back. As a woman, it's nobody's responsibility to read our minds, and some people are bad at reading cues too. He could've handled it better and been the bigger person, but he doesn't owe her an apology for anything but the words he chose to use. If you want to vent but are not in the mood for suggestions back from someone you *usually go to for help* then it's on you to specify that. The cursing wasn't necessary but he had a right to feel angry."
aij3cl,"NTA. The thing with cultural appropriation is that it's when some larger culture appropriates a smaller, less powerful culture's customs or clothing or the like *with the intent to gain profit from it*. If you are just wearing some other culture's clothing because you like it and you want to wear it, that's fine. This is called *cultural exchange*. "
aij4m2,"YTA any time you tear down someone else to make yourself seem better. 

[Relevant song!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3j5YYJ9eI8)"
aij69z,"I'm not going to tell someone whether or not they consented to something. She says she did. So I'm looking at this as an act that she is willing to participate in, and I'm questioning whether that's true, honestly. 

The way I see it there are two possibilities:
 
1. OP is fine with receiving oral but feels giving somehow makes her a slut. It doesn't!
2. OP is *not* fine with receiving. In which case that should stop entirely and she needs to be honest about that."
aija2y,"NTA, and giving her more money is only enabling her stupidity.  Never give her cash if you know she’s like that. Next time you want to help go to the landlord and pay her rent directly, she can’t be trusted to do it herself. "
aijar5,"YTA. 

I don't give a fuck if it's catering to jesus christ or Satan. People stick their asses out for you in reference and you just up and quit without giving a heads up. That's a fucking shit move to do. Nah man. Asshole. Now those people who stuck their heads out? Now their asses on the line. 

I hope this new job is worth it man. "

There are few things more irritating than a person who refuses to make a suggestion, and also refuses to acquiesce to the choices made by others. You were being a brat."
aik5sf,Guess what? Your parents can spend their money however they want. You have *nothing* to do with their finances. Your brother isn't an asshole for them spoiling him. Worry about yourself. It does suck that his lessons became 1000 dollars more expensive though. 
aik7zc,"NTA in the slightest, your mother clearly does not have your best interests at heart, and I’m sorry you have to deal with that.  Maybe you should pop over to [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/?st=JR7EMS20&sh=1d68e377) and see if anyone has any tips to help you get the education you deserve."
aiklj9,"NTA. He's making a big deal about nothing. People forget stuff and it's been 6 years, you are happily married, it's not like you have added to your 'total' since then so I don't know why he is upset."
aikpyv,I'm in a western country so I would say NTA without hesitation. But I don't know enough about your culture to give a more informed answer. Aren't you technically free to do as you wish?

ail49k,"Y’know what, I’d  just be super honest with her. Tell her you know she’s trying to fit in and that you know she’s unsure about her place in the group but that her try hard behaviour is pushing you all away. I’d do it in a more tactful and gentle manner though because I don’t think there’s any maliciousness there just a deep insecurity but that type of behaviour has a way of festering and becoming resentment if it’s not addressed. Perhaps give her the reassurance that she’s worth knowing and doesn’t need to be an exact copy of anyone else and some encouragement to develop her own thing and find out what interests her. If she continues with the same behaviour then I’d start thinking of exit plans because it gets tiring really quickly to deal with these people."
ailgdu,"NTA.

I can see your parents' wishes for your sister and you, but if they know you have allergies and the working conditions are harsh, they shouldn't pressure you, and you shouldn't have to be dependent of your parents' success.

They can't supply you forever.

Talk with em, and take care <3"
ailir3,"NTA

Good on you for respecting her relationship with her bf. "
ailj85,"NTA.

You should read their policies so you can hit them legally, so they can't use any loopholes like ""we usually don't give anything at all""

And if you are correct and they don't compensate you fully, you can take it to court and demand compensation.

&#x200B;

Best of luck, take care <3"
ailmq8,"NTA: But I feel the devil is in the details here.  I've seen a couple of ""pretty much what I said"" here.  You should go back and think of there is anything else you may have said that would lead to that reaction... "
aimbzp,"NTA

You didn’t date, you don’t owe her anything, there can be no reasonable expectation you’d automatically rule out seeing a friend of hers just because you guys almost were dating beforehand. I can sympathise with her feelings, but not her actions if she called you an asshole"
aimeci,NTA for not wanting to attend a work party on your day off. I would consider if there is a cost to you for not attending. Will your absence be noticed in a negative way? Will not attending brand you as “not a team player” in your work environment?
aimh29,"YTA (or SHP) for being the dickhead people can hear from ""miles away"" and being proud of it. No one is impressed."
aims55,"ESH

High school petty bullshit is all it is. Both of you don’t have that real world experience on handling personal problems. 5 years from now you’ll look back and think “god we were so stupid.”"
aimt0d,"NTA. Your friend sounds like he has some serious anger problems. It is a game, if the account belonged to you originally, it still belongs to you. As long as you made that very clear from the start. I let one of my close friends play WoW on my account when I wasn't using it. He was very angry and annoyed when I opted to kick him off my account completely, but at the end of the day he manned up and bought his own account so we could play together. I do not think it was needed to send the picture of your friends character to him, rubbing it in his face is not needed. "
aimu0s,"ESH, you put someone up on a pedestal and idealised someone who wasn't that interested in you and you clearly had an incredibly unhealthy obsession with her that you should have recognised a long time ago. Blindly following what other people say, do, like and dislike is incredibly creepy and far beyond the realms of normal behaviour and the fact that you consider that loyalty and you're upset that she didn't do the same for you is borderline insanity. 

However Wolfie was clearly keeping you on her hook for years, she enjoyed the attention that you lavished upon her and the fact that she distances herself from you when she was in a relationship is very telling of that. She's an asshole, but you enabled her to be an asshole for years, you even recognised it yourself, but that doesn't make you not an asshole, you let it happen and you're just as much to blame for the last 6 years of your life as she was."
aimwre,"NTA. As it seems, it wasn’t just this one thing that made you break up, but rather a combination of everything. A lot of times it’s that one thing to make us think about the entire relationship differently and realize some things that we didn’t see before. "
aimxyd,NTA - That is too many dogs for him to control unleashed. They should all be leashed at all times. Depending on local bylaws he could be violating them by having the dogs unleashed. 
ain08v,NTA. Women that do things like this are as disgusting as men who force themselves on women. True friends should listen if nothing else and be an open ear for you to vent. Get yourself some new friend my man and don’t speak to that girl again without someone else present; I wouldn’t trust her not to warp the conversation for her benefit later down the road. 
ainf1h,"ESH. 

NOT for dating, I'm gonna be very clear on that, but for rubbing it on his face. You guys do you (and each other), but the second you use your relationship with the intention of hurting him, that makes you assholes. 

And he is a full blown asshole, that's for sure. "
ainjl1,"NAH.  If you were both (say) 25 and acted this way I would say you were both assholes, but at 13 this is just being new to relationships.  She was selfish, you were silent about a lot of things when you should have spoken up.  Hopefully you know better now.  

If you are asking because you feel bad about how things ended back when you were 13, it wouldn't be crazy to reach out and talk a little.  But I would assume it's long in the past for her too."
ainl99,"NAH. Just a misunderstanding. If he didn’t want to see those specific photos, it’s not wrong for him to delete them. And you’re not wrong for stopping him from doing that. Just tell him you were joking but if it does bother him, you’ll ask others to stop with splatoon porn. (There’s a sentence I never thought I’d type)"
aint4a,"NTA, at all. The mom is being shitty in this situation, as monetary value is certainly not the only way to assign worth to something. You explained your rationale nicely and the kid should have been reprimanded for their response. "
aio0x8,"NTA.  I'd have said it was neither, but""

>He basically laughed at me...and then even got in a VC in discord and laughed and told our mutual friends ""haha my gf is so jealous""

That's not the kind of thing a good partner does, airing your couple's problems to your friends.  It's not like he wanted input deciding if what you were asking for was okay."
aio9as,"NTA that's a serious red flag, get the fuck out of there fast. You might love her but it's for your own good, she's toxic and isn't good for you"
aioc43,"NTA I don't see how that would be offensive or making light of his death, kinda seems like honoring him as a story teller"
aiofau,"YTA.

People have different social compasses, i am just like you, i wouldn't mind spending 100h with my girlfriend, but after like a day and a half, my girlfriend tells me she needs a half an hour to clear her head, just completely solidarity.

AND THAT'S FINE, just give it to her, why would you want to push it? That'll only make it worse for the both of you, but you especially.

Tldr; your girlfriend is her own person and might need some time off every once in a while, and she's allowed to  have some alone time, just calm down❤️"
aiogyb,"NTA for saying no, but friends do favors for each other so don't be surprised if she treats you like less of a friend for it. In fact, asking someone to do you a favor is a very effective way of strengthening a friendship.

You're not an asshole, but also probably won't be her friend in any real sense."
aioiwd,"NTA

It really varies by corporate culture.  It definitely sends a message to the employees about how the company feels about them.  

It doesn’t sound like you acted rude or were an asshole.  I think it’s part of analyzing your compensation to observe these things.  "
aioiyi,"NTA

I fully expected to think otherwise when I started the story.

Even if their mistreatment of your dog isn't as bad as you allege (which I don't doubt you, but I'm sure they would dispute it), if you tie a large dog to a breakable glass table, you don't get to blame the dog if the table ends up broken."
aioj32,Not in any way the asshole. It's not your obligation to talk somebody through their depression EVERY DAY ABOUT THE SAME SHIT. Unless you unless you enjoy playing therapist. I might know a little about this😑
aiootg,"NAH. This is a really complicated case. In one way, you shouldn't have to hide who you are if you're comfortable with it. But in another, you should also have a talk with your boyfriend about this so you don't spring this on his parents before he can tell them. 

It isn't just his call to hide your gender identity and it'll be best if you two can come clean about both your and his anxiety, concerns and insecurity."
aiovdh,"NTA - it’s not like you’re telling her she can’t come, which would be quite different. "
aiovr2,"NAH. If he is as good a friend as you believe, then he would understand why you would have to refuse. But, consider taking him up on his offer... at least for just you (as long as your wife approves). If he's willing to pay your way, it means he's a good friend and really wants you there."
aip3en,"YTA for the way you're handling this.

Why not go home, talk to your parents and make a PLAN for your life.  Apprentishhip, learning a hands-on skill, or getting a full time job may make a difference.  If you're just floating around with no direction and your parents have spent a lot of money on school and you didn't even bother to tell them that you were failing then they have every right to be pissed.  Get your shit together."

aipx4p,"NTA. You should've distanced yourself right after the break up and given yourself time to grieve/heal/ move on. If she asks why you ghosted her, just explain the situation and leave it at that. Hopefully she understands and gives you space."
aiq2zo,NTA especially as you have kept it to encourage him next time. Plus it was his idea! 
aiqdcw,"YTA

You signed up for too many classes and are stressed out, now you're taking it out on your roommate. If it's a house you own, and you can afford to live there alone, go ahead and push them out.

Asking for notice before anyone is brought over the the most egregiously bad part. That's completely unrealistic and a violation of their privacy. Headphones aren't unreasonable, nor are some of the others.

What really won me over to the you're an asshole side was:

>With that said, I am debating drafting a 'Spring 2019 House rules' sheet 

Go talk with them like a human."
aiqoti,"More info needed - if during the conversation with friend B, he said something like ""I don't know if we should tell A, can you keep it to yourself while I figure out what to do"" then you'd be the AH. If he didn't ask you to keep it to yourself then you're not."
aiqq33,"NTA, it was extremely presumptuous of your friend to associate you signing a card with you ponying up $30 for a gift to someone you're on the outs with. 

If anything, forward .50 for your portion of the card. "
aiqqzr,"YTA. Massive asshole. Bullying is bad. But its highschool, and some people dont get along. The response isn't to be a fucking sociopath. You took it from a 5 to a 10.

I hope you have classmates on reddit and this gets traced back to you so that you can enjoy your suspension."

airp2b,"ESH. Your cousin was an asshole for pushing you, not respecting your choices, and refusing to drop it. But you were totally an asshole for the breeder and wrecked vagina comments."
airqpk,"NTA. Red flag. You are a maid to your boyfriend AND his family. He ""forgets"" to ""help"" you with chores for the house where he also lives? That's not being a partner, that's acting like a guest. And guests, who don't help out around the house, are also subject to your rules, which is that you get to kick them out when you're tired of them. Men who say ""oh why didn't you TELL me that you needed me to HELP you with the chores?"" don't see chores as their job. They think the woman should do it and then feel like benefactors and pat themselves on the back for doing a tiny thing. Because they're selfish, immature, and entitled.

You're an adult, you're the host, you set the rules. If the guests are too much (and they seem to be) for whatever reason, you can, without needing justification, tell SO that you're done hosting them and they need to leave. Or they need to clean up their own mess because you'll ONLY clean your own plates and do your own laundry. Or they need to pay rent. 

Your ""love"" for this man isn't going to fix anything. Your BPD isn't the issue. The issue is that you have a bunch of toddlers in your hands and you're being run ragged. Don't try to save your relationship with a man-child; save yourself. If he's worth it, he'll grow up and step up. If not, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Trust me, you're really not missing out on much."

He should've been more considerate to someone trying to get some rest, but you should've asked him to keep it down in a much nicer way. "
aismr6,"NAH, you want a cool pic a friend took of you, but he wants to keep it because it's a piece of art he made. It's a film camera you said, so if he still has the film he can reprint another for you, or he could take it in somewhere to have it printed if he doesn't have access to a darkroom."

ait16s,The game cannot be completed or enjoyed. It has a different script in which you fail due to game piracy hurting sales.
ait9td,"YTA. It could be an honest mistake. It's your first birthday together. Guys remembering wedding anniversaries after so many years of marriage is so common that it's a trope. You can be disappointed but you can also choose to be an adult and understand that maybe she isn't out to get you, and ask her to remember or write it down next time. But you say she ""claims"" to have memory issues and go on to imply that she's probably lying. And you go on to say YOU remembered HER birthday, and therefore she owes it to remember your birthday. Scorekeeping and assuming that your SO is a liar is too immature a mindset for an adult relationship."
aitblg,YTA for telling him not to contact you and then trying to reach out to him. That's some drama queen bullshit. Make a clean break.
aitft5,"Nta. That's an uncomfortable work environment. Also if your manager is aware of this behavior and not correcting it, go to someone in HR. "
aitgqg,"YTA. 

Her job, her ducks, her rows. she owns any consequences. There is something to be said about not being able to drop work immediately, even if you work from home you can have meetings and things.

If you want/need things its up to you to communicate it."

Children are often free from responsibility, and are taken care of and have their needs seen to by others. Partners contribute to the household and share the load, and consider your needs and help to make sure they are also met.

You are definitely NTA here."
aiudm5,"NTA. Your gf is just feeling jealousy but she can’t just tell you to stop being friends with someone. You already told her it was just a friendship and nothing more and yet she still wanted you to break ties with her. She felt jealous, you told her it was nothing to worry about and that Jane even had a boyfriend and she still wanted you to break ties. I say talk it out with your GF and if she still doesn’t want you to be friends then I would still be friends with Jane. Again, this is what I would do and I’m not saying you have to because it’s your life and I can’t force you to do anything, and neither should your GF. "
aiudwq,"No A-Holes Here.  

I get you don’t want to spend two weeks with her and I get that she’s just *ok*. But you agreed to it and this girl is a big part of your friends life. My suggestion is to make the best of it. If you go into the trip with a negative assumption of the next two weeks, it’s going to suck. You’ll look for everything wrong in every situation and attribute it to this girl being here when she wasn’t supposed to be. 

Just go and have fun. You got your girl, your friends, and two weeks to not care about a thing in the world. Make the best of it. "
aiuh5h,"NTA it's your life, and it's not your job to support your girlfriend, who is not your wife and therefore not someone who you need to make these joint decisions with. Sometimes you need to do what's best for yourself. If she's not okay with that then she's not a great girlfriend."

aiulb8,NTA Why in the world should you have paid for her and HER FRIEND when you were the one who was invited?
aiuwx5,"NTA. They were verbally abusive to you, and they kicked you out with less notice than a stranger would have gotten. They aren't entitled to your forgiveness. They may have acknowledged what they did to you, they may have apologised, but it is always the choice of the injured party whether to forgive or not because they can never undo what they've done. I don't know if I'd be in contact with them in your position, I tend to hold grudges, but you certainly don't owe them your time."
aiuxzs,ESH. The dad should've taken his child out of the theater when he wouldn't stop yelling but you didn't need to talk to the poor guy like that. He probably had enough problems with his screaming child. You should've asked an usher to kick them out.

aiwrnh,"NTA, well, your parents aren't the assholes if that's the question. The money is your parents, so they get to decide what to do with it. If they feel that $2500 is too much, then it's too much. If your sister doesn't like it, then she gets a job and saves up the money herself. She isn't entitled to that. As for going overseas to volunteer, they aren't the assholes for that either. At 16 she will still be under their care and they have to make the best decisions they can for her. Not to mention once again, it's their money and they decide what gets done with it.

You aren't the asshole for staying out of it. This is not your fight.

Your sister is the asshole. She's 14 and having a tantrum about something that's two years away that she isn't entitled to. The car thing might be solvable if she gets a job and saves money, but your parents have the right to put their foot down on the volunteering thing."

aiydqe,"100% YWBTA.

It's a teachers job to show provocative or different from the norm opinions, if for nothing else to give you a truly rounded perspective.

A truly good teacher will show ""both sides"" and encourage critical thinking. They also won't tell you which side is right. Bottom line, just because a teacher is exposing you to a different ""side"" doesn't necessarily mean they themselves hold that position. You are shooting the messenger here, when your issue is against the message.

aiz8a5,"You know, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say YTA, because I'm having a hard time believing that we aren't getting a really skewed version of the story. 

A telling part here is you explaining that the people who didn't agree with you were ""hardcore feminists"".  Because you already made it a huge point that this woman purposely started stretching *directly in front of you* in an otherwise empty gym and then started hounding you for staring, the implication being that she was intending to start a scene. So a woman basically manufactures a confrontation out of nothing and the only people not on your side are ""hardcore feminists""? I think you're trying to paint a picture of the Purple Haired SJW Boogeyman here and reading between the lines here tells me you have a preconceived notion of such things. 

A wise man once told me ""never use all of your excuses at once"", so not only did you lie about being gay (and spouted off a really dumb stereotypical Hollywood Gay ""sassy"" comeback like Bender making fun of Leela's green top) you're *also* autistic and can't help but look at colorful things and *also* weren't wearing your glasses and couldn't see anyway and *also* you're actually engaged and have no desire to stare anyway and *also* had nowhere else to look because she parked right in front of you? Seems like you're working overtime to absolve yourself of getting busted. 

I think a far more likely scenario is that you got caught sneaking a peek, got called out, and panicked and made a really terrible excuse (either because of a genuinely panicked brain-fart or because you think being gay is a bulletproof defense against these boogeyman SJWs, I don't know, but I've got a hunch) and now you're making up even more excuses to strangers on the internet to assuage your bruised ego. 

Even if your version of events is 100% Y still TA for making such a dumb excuse and expecting that to get you off the hook. "

It doesn't sound like either of you is actively trying to hurt the other.  You just view things very differently and unintended actions scrub the scabs off old perceived hurts.

aj0p5u,"YTA. You're getting mad at your sister for wanting her own dog, admit your family can afford it, and only dislike the idea because of a completely hypothetical situation where the dogs don't like each other and because you ""can't care"" about the new dog.

The dog *isn't* for you. It's for your sister. You don't have to like it, and it's not going to actually create hardship. If the dogs don't like each other then you can worry about that bridge as you cross it, so to speak.

It sounds like your mom and sister have been aware of, and planning this, for a while now. Clearly they've taken things into consideration. If your mom (the adult here) thinks she can handle a dog she probably can. 

Give it a chance. Realistically you may not like the dog, but as long as its safe with the existing pets and humans who cares? Besides *you* might not like the new dog, but your dog might enjoy having another dog to play with, which isn't a bad thing like you describe. "

It sounds like she might be lonely. Does she engage in hobbies? Is she in school? She’s not handling her time healthily, and it seems like something that could potentially harm your relationship in the long run. She has to respect your time and boundaries as everyone should in a relationship, so no you’re NTA for saying you have responsibilities. 


Have you asked her if something is wrong? It’s not normal behavior, no disrespect. I hope she is okay. And I hope that your marriage is a great one.

aj1noh,"My opinion may be an unpopular one, but:  
**You're an asshole, and she's an asshole, too.**   
Considering what you're going through, it's *mostly* reasonable that you would be an asshole from time to time.

1. **Only you know what you're ready for and can handle****.** You can't assume everyone understands how you're handling your grief if you don't verbalize it.
   1. You know Sandy well enough to know she's a lot in a bar setting. 
      1. You could've said 'no' as soon as you knew where she wanted to go, or made another suggestion. You agreed to do her thing.
      2. Once you knew dinner was kaput, you could've rescheduled for another day.
2. You were aware she was planning to use your time out as her '*me'* time, as well as, try to show you a good time to maybe distract you from your pain. 
   1. She's the asshole for not asking you what you wanted to do considering she bore witness, firsthand, to what you were dealing with.
   2. **From the way you chose your words**, you sound as though you expected her to forget about herself and solely focus on you, which I'm guessing you didn't indicate to her. 
      1. **She's obviously not a mind-reader, nor does she seem very empathic.**
3. You chose to sit at the bar, and alienate yourself from everyone with exception to the bartender.
   1. You indicated you drove, which meant you could've left at any time.
   2. She's the asshole for trotting off and leaving you alone for lengthy periods.
   3. She's an asshole for being obnoxious and over-the-top when she dealt with you (bringing people over, telling the bartender you thought he was cute).
      1. I reiterate, **she's obviously not a mind-reader, nor does she seem very empathic**.
      2. That doesn't mean she's a bad person, or a bad friend. She's just a dumbass sometimes.
4. Her text to you doesn't sound like she's shifting blame on you, more that she's trying to understand that you're more sensitive at this time than you might not otherwise be.
   1. You exploded on her which made her right in her head.
      1. It reads like you berated her.
      2. You accused her of being selfish in your outbursts & novel-long texts. She might not have felt she was being selfish, which doesn't mean she has a ""twisted mind"". She just thinks differently.
   2. You compared her to everyone else. She's not them. She's not going to do what they did, and you were wrong for having an expectation you didn't communicate.
   3. She's the asshole because she shouldn't ignore you.
   4. She's, also, the asshole for thinking how she'd cope with something would work for you.
   5. She's just a jerk for not reading your **obvious** body language, noticing you were alienating yourself, and bringing attention you clearly didn't want to you.

I applaud that you didn't tell her the friendship should end, but should change with great suggestions. That was the best thing you could've done, especially since you know you don't like the drunk version of your friend in a social setting.

Grief is a fickle thing. A person in mourning doesn't know what to expect from themselves day-to-day. If that person doesn't know what to expect from their emotions, no one else should be expected to know either.

Assuming you don't, communicate your needs to your friend (s) better. She may meet your expectation, exceed your expectation, or let you down completely. At least you'll know you told them *exactly* what you needed from them.

I hope you find some relief soon. <3

As someone who was in a very similar situation to your bud, what ultimately helped me get out permanently was friends like you who knew how to keep things real and tell me that I needed to stop, that it wasn't healthy and that I was visibly collapsing. Please, though, if you can, try to be there for him. He's going through a special kind of torture and he clearly needs help. If you can't supply that help, then don't try to.

aj3sah,"NTA. This is a classic story in the JustNoFamily sub. Inlaws have no boundaries, you demand boundaries, husband acts like a poor helpless victim stuck in the middle so you feel guilted into giving up your boundaries for his sake. What's happening in reality is that he is taking the easy way out. He doesn't want to deal with growing up and changing with a family of his own; he wants to stay the boy at their beck and call, because to do otherwise is to upset the familiar and the comfortable, and he's afraid of the consequences from them. Consequences from you, not so much, because he knows that you'll let him get away with it. He's using your kindness to your advantage, and is actively making you sacrifice your own boundaries so he can be comfortable and be seen as the nice guy and you can take the blame. You're not the one driving him away from family - this is the classic mindset that guilts you into continuing to be a doormat so he can be comfortable; he's the one driving you away from him if he keeps this up.  I'd suggest going to some counseling if you are both serious about keeping this marriage healthy."

The only thing I can see being an issue is yeah, you probably should clear the whole sidewalk and not just a path. You’re not an asshole, but maybe a bit lazy.

While I get where you friend is coming from (video games, especially competitive ones, can be extremely frustrating and rage inducing), unless it is really detrimental to your relationship/communications with each other, bringing up something that people are always touchy about (such as their emotions at their worst) generally is a recipe for disaster. 

If this would've negatively impact of your relationship with each other had it not been addressed, there would've been better ways to approach it. You could have discussed this with him in a more one on one and calm manner, or you could've waited for him to calm down a little bit before bringing it up.  

To be completely honest, I think that your friend is more upset about you embarrassing him in front of your mutual friends. If you somehow manage to communicate with him, apologize profusely to him and admit to making poor decisions (even if you don't fully believe it) because right now he probably feels very betrayed and embarrassed because of you."

It makes no sense. Tell her how you feel and ask her to explain why she feels that way. Maybe if you make her walk through her logic, step by step, she will realize she's in the wrong. Good luck!"
aj9swk,"YTA. I think your parents trying to prevent you from using the scholarship money is a bad idea, but I totally see why they would do so; 80 hours of community service and a short essay is not an excuse for your grades to slip down to Ds. I'd be upset if I was your parents as well, so your comment about your mom's job is really out of line.

Get your grades up. Period. Your only excuse is gone now, so fix the problem. And obviously apologize to your mom."
aj9v5r,"NAH.

The sexual dynamic says it all. It just wouldn't be respectful to your girlfriend to keep close contact with your ex who became friends with benefits.

Maybe you don't have to completely ghost her, but obviously having late night chats and hanging out with her alone needs to stop.

But you're justified in your decision to ghost as well if you think that the contact with your ex will cause you grief. "
aj9vx9,"NTA- I mean, what are you supposed to do? I guess you could send him away, but what if $Jason was expecting him?

If $ doesn't want to be woken up then he should tell his buddy that."

aja1al,"YTA.

Periods are a bitch, she didn’t get it on purpose just to piss you off on days you had plans. If she’s got a heavy flow and hellspawn cramps each time of COURSE she doesn’t want to go out and sit in public with a giant ass pad on being uncomfortable bleeding out. And depending on her hormone levels when she does bleed, she might be swinging from left to right field because of the imbalance, she could control her emotions a bit better but you can’t just act like it’s her fault halfway. Shit happens and lots of girls don’t feel like being sexy or fun and fancy free when they’ve got tissue falling from their vagina.

Not every woman is your ex, her vagina isn’t the same, don’t hold her to some unrealistic expectation because she could really, genuinely be in tier 10 pain.

ajaclz,"NAH. Just two socially awkward, and presumably very warm people. No one here was being rude, silence alone isn't rude (she might not have noticed you and you said she was eating something also), and communicating the problem to get a resolution isn't rude.

ajacpn,"NTA. Your mother is an addict and your father is enabling her. She'll never solve the issue though until she recognises it and wants to change. As hard as it may be to accept, there isn't really anything you can do to stop her at this point, certainly not while your father is continuing to enable the behaviour. Definitely not the asshole for not lending her money, it'll get tossed down the drain with the rest of it, but don't be surprised if the emergencies and lies become more and more desperate. You may want to contact a gambling support organisation yourself. They often have resources for families of addicts."
ajav8y,"NTA, your original plans got ruined. You’re tight on money, they’re causing problems. Why go on the trip if before the trip even starts there is problems? I’d only expect you to experience more problems whilst on the trip. "
ajaz3n,"No. You would not be the a-hole. You can be great friends with someone and it still be a bad idea to live together. Secondly she went back and forth so long that you asked someone else and it got more complicated. Just dont lead her on that would be the a-hole move.
Why did you think it would be a good idea in the first place?"
ajb2e4,"NTA I've freaked people out with my own weird shit before. Never blamed them.

ajbc0z,[deleted]
ajbe1s,"NTA, you didn't force him to do anything. You persuaded him to ask her out when you had no other information than they were very close friends and he really liked her, suddenly getting the information that she isnt into him doesn't mean that you're now choosing for him.

I understand that they may think you could have saved him the embarrassment of rejection, but at the same time even as a friend it's not your responsibility to coddle him and keep him safe from emotion, you're not his Mother, and as callous as it sounds people need some rejection in their life every so often. If nothing else just so they know how to handle the next time.

Your inaction does not make you a bad friend, it makes you one who realises that this will benefit him in the long run, and I applaud you for being that friend amidst a plethora of ""Mom-Friends.""

ajbnam,"Nta. That sound like such a bunch of cunts

ajbo1q,"YTA.  It sounds like his problems are more psychological than physical; he needs some patience and less pressure. You could also try to put the condom on yourself, or at least help him so there's less fumbling/more intimacy. Beyond that, it's his body and his decision. Medications are not without risk, and he shouldn't be pressured. Imagine how you would feel if he was constantly asking you to take hormonal birth control, and realize you're doing the same thing to him."
ajbub6,"NTA  As an instructor myself, I would want to be made aware of these types of situations, although generally the teacher should be actively monitoring the class.  Although it certainly isn't something required of you, I always appreciate students informing me of things I would have otherwise missed. And it wasn't like cheating was doing herself any good, as she clearly won't understand the material. Hopefully she uses it as a lesson and a reason for actually studying in the future, because continuing to get away with cheating will just enforce bad habits. "
ajbvqt,"YTA. In the off chance that you aren't shit posting... you're one big annoyance of a kid. You spend a lot of time talking back. First of all, your dad was shitty because your ""filthy weebo"" self probably doesn't do much around the house and hides in your room like you said, yet you come out to get shitty about a glass being used by him? Have you considered helping out with the dishes or something? Also, it's a fucking glass. The fact that you stuck around and tried to force your dad to say sorry for *using a glass* is really weird, man. Then you antagonized him over his foot? You bitch at your mom for wanting you to go shopping? You're the classic spoiled brat. Following all this up with fighting your dad over the internet, something he pays for because you don't, makes you look even worse.

I don't know if you're like this to other people or just your parents, but you're going to face some moments of seriously harsh reality if you go around trying to treat people like this."
ajbvxo,YTA for even staying with him. Is this post a joke?

ajd6wc,"NTA, but your roommate doesn't sound like a huge asshole either. Just a little one. I think working in the same room all day plus living together is just way too much togetherness. Not many relationships can stand up to that. I'd try to leave on those terms to keep your professional life manageable. ""Hey it's not you and it's not me, it's just too much us."""
ajdrhv,"NTA
you're not obligated to spend time with him, he doesn't have to be mean to you to get your attention, calling you names and berating you is a good reason to avoid him, if that's the only way he can get attention, therapy may be a good option. you're definitely not the asshole"
ajdybt,"NTA - But you can't throw that in his face as a trump card in every argument--at least not forever.  Eventually you guys will have to let it go and never speak of it again.  You will of course know that he's capable of it and the both of you will work together to not let him be put in a situation where trust could be violated.  You can't get bit by a shark if you don't go in the water--but he has to avoid the water himself, you can't hold him back from it."
ajdzch,"NAH

I was ready to call you an asshole but it sounds like whatever is going on with that kid, they are disrupting your ability to learn, which isn’t good. 

That being said I wouldn’t label that kid an asshole because they may not (or may) know that what they are doing is a problem.   We would need to know what’s going on with the kid. "
aje0q1,"Everyone is telling you NTA but I'm gonna reiterate: splitting ""evenly"" only works fairly if you're earning evenly. You're not. If you're paying 3% of your income to for rent and she's paying 30% as an example, she's bogged down by the massive relative blow of this while you greatly benefit from the relatively lightness of the financial weight, and your ""even"" contribution is further hurting her chance of amassing wealth. This is exactly how poverty and wealth get passed through generations; they start out on different footings and the privileges of wealth expand while the penalties of poverty continue to keep them poor. 

Equality and justice are two different things. If you're starting out low, you get a booster seat up for a reason, so that you can get a fair shot at life. Everyone who starts out differently having to pay the same amount is not equality or fairness, which is why there are tax brackets for different income levels. A truly fair system would be an even RATIO, not an amount, e.g. you both pay 30% of your income to household stuff, as an example, so that it's hurting your bank account the exact same amount. Not a drop from your bucket against the huge ding on hers. 

Now that you know that this is not a fair ratio, choosing to split 50/50 is a deliberate refusal on your part to help alleviate the financial burden on your gf while it doesn't hurt you in any way to make it more fair by means of an even ratio split. If you want the pretense of ""fairness"" like a roommate, sure, split the bills evenly, but know that you're treating her like a roommate whose life you don't really care about. A romantic partner who loves you and cares about your life, financial anxiety included, who has the maturity and generosity of an adult, might say: ""honey, I make much more money than you, I'll pay the rent and you can just cover the occasional movie ticket and groceries."" Or ""Let's both pay 30% of our income into the joint pool to be fair."" My SO used to do 50/50 with their ex, moved onto me, and then started doing the even ratio thing instead of the flat rate thing because they realized that they had a financial advantage over me and 50/50 is not truly ""fair"". "
aje0tp,"NTA 

She was playing favorites with her children, and now that has extended into the in-laws. All grandchildren being born should have the same excitement and happiness from their grandparents, no matter if it’s the first, second, or tenth.

Your MIL is disrespecting you and your husband relationship by playing favorites, and it’s not fair to you. If I were you, I would realize this and limit my contact and much as possible. And your husband needs a talk with his mother on her behavior, because I can guarantee you this causes resentment in your husband as well. Whether he accepts it or not I don’t know, but he knows it exists. 

No child wants to be born in this world knowing they are second to their siblings/cousin or relative. Your MIL is establishing favoritism before they are even born. If she doesn’t change, don’t let this toxic person into your child’s life. "
aje42h,"NTA, if you want to keep a tentative relationship with the kids I would recommend sending them presents on Christmas or their birthdays include a card telling them how much you care for them and when they are older your phone number. Hopefully one day they'll want to reach out and get to know the cool relative that kept sending them gifts."

ajeu2w,"NTA - she didn’t even have the right to ask you to leave the room the first time. I would have stayed in my bed and showed off my eye mask and earplugs. If she wanted privacy, she could have gotten a hotel room for her and her boyfriend or fucked in her car like civilized people. "

ajfikj,"NAH- I get that you want to keep this private, but she has to be able to talk and vent to SOMEONE. As long as that friend isn't spreading the story around, or if she was telling every friend she could, that would be different.

ajfmjw,"ESH, don't argue with people on the internet and you shouldn't be cruel about their personal lives even if they are cruel first."
ajfnsc,"It sounds like the real issue here isn't you being able to complain about your job, it's your sister insisting that you find another job. 

You need to set clear boundaries: tell her that you do not want to discuss your job/career options with her, and tell her that's final. That you're not willing to have that conversation with her, and that if she insists, you'll be seeing less of her. 

You also need to be aware that your sister is not the right person to complain about your job to, precisely because she disagrees with your job of choice at the moment. It's probably best for everyone if you just avoid the topic altogether with her. "

ajg2ls,This sounds like something that anybody with common sense would have reported to the correct authorities a long time ago
ajgazv,"YTA. Not for not wanting to go, you're free to feel whatever. But for the way you approach your SO's family engagements in general. It sounds like your basic attitude is ""but I don't know them"" ""but what will I do there"" so it's all about you. How entertained you will be, how awkward you will be, how the party will cater to your feelings. Which is a fine attitude if you still want to have a single life. But if you're serious about marrying someone, you need to realize that the things that matter to them a lot need to matter to you a little bit, not because they entertain you but because they're important to your SO. Your company party will come again. Your SO's irreplaceable sister, and her potentially once-in-a-lifetime engagement party, is something that probably won't. And your SO wants to have someone she loves by her side to celebrate this with her family, as a part of that family. ""But I have this work thing"" is going to sound pretty pale in comparison to that, even if it's not as douchey as ""but what will I do there"", and yes, it WILL sound like you don't care that much about the family occasion that is important to her because you will put work first - not even work, but a work party over her family celebration."

ajiru4,"ESH. The boyfriend sucks because he's controlling/possessive/obsessive. The friend sucks because she's letting him control her life this way. You suck because you're getting into screaming matches about it and worrying about how it's affecting you instead. When somebody is in a relationship like this, you can't force them to see reality until they're ready. "
ajiz90,"YTA.  Kids are kids, but, unless there is a significant developmental delay, an 11 year old and a 14 year old should be able to behave reasonably well for a week. Will there be some squabbles? Sure. But that would be any kids. By coddling their bad behavior, instead of correcting it, you're raising them to be entitled, and honestly coming across that way yourself. As another solution, could the youngest sleep in the room with you, and the oldest sleep on the couch? If you can't suck it up and deal with it, then stay home. But I think you would really be missing out on the opportunity to have some fun with your family. "

ajl6km,"YAH. Calling her out is different than working to help her improve. If you talked to her in a constructive way that wasn’t meant to hurt her feelings, but instead help her see her choices through a different lens, that would be much better. And by that, I mean suggest a financial tracking app or find a budgeting class you could take together. Then you’re NTA. But if you “call her out” for being “spoiled” there is nothing constructive in that interaction and I doubt it would result in a positive reaction from her at all, let alone asking you for more advice. It’s more of a personal attack on her character than it is a critique of her outward behavior. "

Your husbands reaction is very common and when people overreact like this its usually because they are trying to not-see any problems. Either with themselves, their partner or your relationship in general. I'd say his reaction more than anything is an indicator it'd be good for the two of you.

ajnnw9,NTA. Maybe if he showed some genuine remorse or understanding it would be different. But to just brush it off is very callous IMO. Being bullied at such a young age can have lasting consequences. 
ajnrvj,"Nah, you're doing him a favour.  He's better off without you in his life."
ajnxh7,"YTA , you don't want to be married you just want half of his house . Why waste money on a wedding day you don't even want ?"
ajnz2h,"Normally it is an asshole move to break up with someone over a message but I'm gonna say NTA in this case because the guy has a temper and I would be worried about how he was going to react if he has self-harmed or broken things in the past. Also, now you're broken up, you don't owe him further explanation, so just stop talking to him. "
ajnzl1,"YTA. I get it’s a hazard, but a simple “oh shit babe you left this out please be careful!” Was all that needed to happen. 

Women are so delicate after having children, the last thing she needs is guilt. Baby brain is a legit thing."
ajo5z2,"NTA, your cousin faced no repercussions for what he did, and your family expects you to support him?

Your family seems to be the ones who are the assholes. While your cousin may have brain damage, they seem to pass by or ignore his past, which was the way he got there."
ajo7yu,"YTA.

>She always remembers my birthday and she sends me gifts but I'm not the type of person to make a big deal out of birthdays

She always remembers your birthday AND sends you gifts...and you didn't even bother to make any effort to remember her birthday? That's a dick move. "
ajoes7,"NTA If he wants to watch videos late at night he should wear headphones, you can buy cheap ones if he wants to sleep in them to not worry about breaking an expensive pair. 

Also he could sit facing the screen away from you as to not wake you or just sit in a different room while you are asleep"
ajoib2,"ESH - 21 messages is a lot, but I'm not entirely convinced that after 10 or so separate messages spanning days, you wouldn't be able to send 1 text or IM to say ""I'm on holiday"". "
ajoz39,"NTA - you only offered your advice on the situation. You only told him to do what he felt was right. He made every decision after. Sucks to have lost friends, but it happens. Sounds like he just needed a scapegoat. "
ajp72d,"NTA.  Ted Bundy was a really nice guy, too.  This guy was waaaaay too clingy, IMO, and is either not good at reading social cues, or was completely ignoring them.

Edit to add that a man in his 50’s that didn’t have bad intentions would understand that his behavior could be perceived as very creepy, and would abstain from pestering you.  I think you dodged a bullet."
ajpdql,"NAH- he's playing it safe. 5 months isn't that long honestly and if you guys don't work out it's a hard thing to explain to kids. He shouldn't be telling them you're someone you're not, that's definitely confusing for kids but in the long run if he decides to tell them you're dating it would be a smooth transition. He may have something in his divorce agreement that says he won't bring girlfriends around his kids for a specified period of time or without their mother's approval as well. I know if my husband and I divorced I'd have to know exactly who's around my kids."
ajpg2p,"NAH. If your girlfriend wants to willingly spread sickness, give that poor girl a kiss lol"
ajpg3p,NTA. She needs to seek a proper treatment path and work with a doctor/therapist. You buying her pot is enabling and it doesn't help in the long run.
ajpsq5,"NTA   You absolutely should do your studies first.    ""Taking a break"" can be fatal for many people. She is being pretty selfish and impatient.   If she really is going to end your relationship over this ...  I will say you dodged a bullet."
ajptl9,"I think you are the asshole a little bit here.

Your mother wanted you to go there to help HER. She needed and wanted your support and you didn't go. 

FWIW, I'm an atheist, and I have never been to an open casket funeral. HOWEVER, funerals are for the living, not the dead, and other people's prayers don't affect you. You should go, you don't have to walk up to the casket, and express sympathy for people's pain.

Compassion is something everyone should be able to express, and you chose not to when your mother expressly asked you for it. "
ajpvtp,NTA but I'd actually probably just leave it in a wet pile instead of putting in the dryer because sometimes some things need to be hung or laid flat to dry properly and you don't know the proper care for all the clothing in that load. Unless it was just towels or something.
ajq1ez,"NTA. You were not wrong that your boss is bad at communication. LOL. This has happened to me too... and I hated it.

As an aside, in many jurisdictions if you are scheduled to work -- *as you were because your boss didn't inform you beforehand not to come it* -- that an employer is required to give you a minimum of X hours of pay if they send you home? It varies based on the jurisdiction."
ajq4rt,ESH - Did you really need to bring up the dead dad? 
ajqakf,"NTA

Of course you're not an asshole, your sister expects you to go above and beyond for her. It sounds like you'd be willing to help her out if you could, but realistically can't. "
ajqc61,YTA for violating his privacy.
ajqd7p,NTA. You're inconveniencing no one.
ajqj8i,"NTA. It's your wedding, and it is not unreasonable to not invite a former romantic partner. If your friend can't understand that, he is being the asshole here."
ajql6y,"NTA.

You really aren't asking for much.

Alternatively, if he insists that he doesn't have time, remind him who in the house also works and pays the bills in conjunction to still doing house hold duties.

CONSIDER charging rent if chores are getting cut out. Of course don't do this if they're a minor"
ajqs9v,"NTA, I am honestly a little hesitant on this one, but I will explain why I think NTA. If you asked a price then the cab driver should have actually tried to really calculate it or at least stopped when he hit the agreed upon price mark. I have heard other users comment how cabs sometimes say one price then basically try to extort you for more by not letting you leave. It is illegal in most places I would think to hold someone against their will.

Something about this sounds sketching which is why I am going with NTA."
ajrvwt,"NTA, She sounds super dramatic and tiring. Also, if you show up a half hour late you don't deserve a good seat. Maybe let the instructor know the situation in case she tries to lodge a complaint or something with the school. "
ajrwhu,"Depends on how you say it.   
  
Middle of the lunchroom: ""Oh my god, can you please quit fucking smacking?"" YTA   
  
(Privately, where you're not shaming him in front of everyone.) ""Hey dude, I'm sorry to ask this, but when you chew, it's kinda loud.  Could you try to chew quieter, please?  I really enjoy how quiet this place can be.""  NTA"
ajrx09,"YTA. He has a job where he’s doing physical labor. If he’s tired then he could hurt someone. 

Unless he is missing important events, you should back off. "
ajs5zt,"YTA, but NOT for being upset about her reaction.  YTA for what followed.

If you forgave her and agreed to move on, then having a temper tantrum and refusing to go to dinner with her family is just childish.  Either admit that you haven't forgiven her and you're still mad or stop acting childish and go if you truly have forgiven her."
ajs66u,"NTA (IF IT WAS AGREED UPON)

We were supposed to you say, i think that means you had plans, and if you did, him leaving to get buzzed is a bad excuse and he's the asshole.

Tell him what he did was wrong when he comes back, don't let him repeat this sort of behaviour.

Take care❤️"
ajs97q,NTA. Addiction changes people. He's not the person you knew any more. 
ajs9eq,NTA you are under no obligation to move for them. Rude behavior should not be rewarded either so anyone who got upset at you for having a backbone and not putting up with it can shove it.
ajse5g,"NAH, but do try to talk to them. Say something along the lines of ""hey how's it going I hope you had fun at [event]"" focus on the positive"
ajsjcy,"From reading the title: YTA

After reading the body: YTA. The fuck dude."
ajsmsf,"YTA (but just a little tiny bit)

I understand your frustration, as a Turk in Denmark, you don't want to be looked upon as a unidentified identity, that'd make you feel less human.

BUT.

I do the exact same to people, i analyse their language and facial traits to guess their ethnicity, not to be mean or to create hate, mainly because i find things like that extremely fascinating, it seems as though one of these guys approached you in a kind and curious manner.

You could've reacted in many ways, but, you thought they were speaking ill of you, and you reacted as you did.

Nothing to do about it, we're all assholes sometimes, and we react in wrong ways, being an asshole is usually (and especially in your case) a temporary state of being.

Take care❤️"
ajspxz,[deleted]
ajsqir,[deleted]
ajswm4,"NTA in this specific situation, but if you generally know that you're a jealous person then you know that there's some assholery going on there.

Assuming that this is about this specific guy, and not controlling who she interacts with generally, I agree that this is super sketch and it sounds like she's enjoying the attention he gives her.  It's totally cool to be friends with guys but it is weird to wear a specific piece of jewellery from that person, and she has a severe case of mentionitis.  This usually suggests a crush and I think it's totally appropriate to discuss reasonable boundaries regarding this dude."
ajt0hw,"NTA - if she knows this bothers you, but is doing it anyway, that's not cool."
ajt0um,NTA - why would you want to travel with someone like that?  It sounds like a recipe for disaster; that friend sounds like the kind of person who will want to sit in the hotel room all day looking at memes and then complain endlessly if you want to go out and do stuff.
ajt4jh,"YTA, majorly. Instead of explaining your thoughts, you shouted at her to leave. That makes YTA so hard.

Oh and let me guess, you didn’t finish her?"
ajt4lx,"NTA - He wanted the bring your weight into the breakup, I'd say it's fair game to bring his in too"
ajt80c,"NTA. Sounds like she's been taking advantage of your good will for years, and you're probably better off having things ended. She was totally out of line to personally attack you like that."
ajtdxz,"NAH but if your friend has a history of ED I think you need to understand that how you see her is probably not how she sees herself.  It's OK to talk to her about how you feel about yourself, and how sometimes when she says certain things you can't help but feel a certain way.  But if this person is your friend I would encourage you to try and work on this with her, rather than just asking her to stop.  If she's not really your friend, which I wasn't clear on from your post, then you'd be fine to just back away from the relationship and any conversations that make you uncomfortable."
ajtdzx,NTA. It's your 26 year old brother that burden should fall on before it falls on you.
ajtg4b,"NTA.

Based on that dude's comment, ""repair"" ""fixed"" and that shit. 

You bought it in NON-working order. And you made it work.

As far as I fucking know, that's called repairing/fixing.

Maybe I'm missing something?"
ajth1w,YTA- it’s hard enough to decide to have an abortion without someone else trying to convince you to keep it
ajthyk,"NAH yet - maybe it's time to have a two-night extravaganza?  Or like you said, maybe your kids will be up for having something like board game night tonight, and movie night tomorrow?
"
ajtmym,"ESH.

They are TA because they weren't doing the work you assigned and they didn't communicate to you that it wasn't being done.  Like, WTF?  You're managing this project and they willfully didn't do their part and let the deadline approach without informing you?   

YTA, not for losing your cool in the first meeting (that was completely justified), but for yelling at them AGAIN after your boss talked to you."
ajtokf,"NTA- your boyfriend has a negative attitude about something that he has little choice but to do... That bad attitude is not only going to wear you out, but it's going to make the days *drrrraaaagggg* on and on for him if he doesn't try and find a way to fix it & fast. Like you said- ""home stretch"" - he needs to get out of that funk before it consumes his entire way of thinking... Good Luck! "
ajttqn,"YTA

You are almost always the asshole for screaming at retail/customer service people. Unless they deliberately and maliciously screwed you over...venting angry frustration on people who are held captive to you through their occupation is low."
ajtw6a,"NTA.

First, let me say that I smoke a lot of weed. I have a medical card. And what your husband is doing is NOT okay. Smoking in front of your kids? Are you fucking serious? What kind of dick is this guy? How stupid is he? Okay, end rant.

You're not an asshole. He gave you an ultimatum essentially trying to force you to smoke pot. That's fucked up. That's like trying to force someone to drink, or anything they don't wanna do.

I don't think that it's unreasonable to only spend $100 a MONTH on weed. You have two kids now. $400 a month is a lot of money. 

I'm not married, don't have kids, and that's about what I spend on pot every month. 

Your husband is being a prick. And I really thought this post was going to be way different. Lol"
ajtz56,NTA. Should've come to you first to ask permission instead of inviting herself.
aju52a,ESH. You should wear headphones or turn it down. Your neighbor needs to learn to be quieter too. 
aju61q,"NAH

I don't really think you're being an asshole, but maybe just take it as like a ""Hey, you're not the greatest but that can change."" To me, it seemed like he wasn't trying to be mean, just trying to tell you that there's room for improvement. No one is the best at kissing/intimacy. It's a learning experience constantly. Just try not to take it as personally, and I'm sure you'll move past it. "
ajudbb,"NAH. But let her be. You don't get to decide whom she should and should not date. Is age the only factor? If yes, you should definitely leave her alone. "
ajugfo,"NAH - she spent her last money to spend time with you, therefore she cares, and you've said it isn't her fault. There's also nothing wrong with being bummed about being limited, as long as you aren't projecting blame towards her. "
ajv32u,"NTA. Even though this dude is an asshole and possibly a scammer he's right, you should have thoroughly looked at the phone before you purchased it from some random person. "
ajvdyq,"NTA bringing him into your household would be a recipe for disaster. I would be willing to bet your family would end up kicking him out, based on your description. Dude you don’t want that guy anywhere near your Mom and your sister, for sure.

He’s 30, well and truly an adult. A poor upbringing is no excuse, he knows right from wrong. I have family members with terrible childhoods and they’ve worked hard to better themselves and are living “normal” lives now. This guy doesn’t seem to have even tried, just played the “pity” card all his life.

He’s the AH"
ajvsji,"YTA yeah. Opening up about sexual desires/kinks is so difficult - especially for women. It takes a lot of growth, unlearning and trust for a lot of women to be able to even think about expressing their wants/needs. By shutting her sext down and saying she needs therapy you are shaming her for her fantasies.

So while I don't think you did it to be an asshole on purpose, you should definitely apologise. "
ajw15z,"YTA, omg."
ajw43z,"NTA. While putting trash on somebody’s car is a dick move, it was meant to be an eye opener. Have a talk with them when everything cools down and explain that everybody needs to do their fair share of chores around the house."
ajw8yw,"NTA - no one cares, you take advantage of deals like this"
ajwcb8,"NAH, But you've got to be like Elsa and ""Let it go"", people grow in different directions, she's moving away emotionally , and you've got to respect that, make some new friends, give her some space , give her a chance to miss you"
ajweqw,"NTA for thinking it because let's be honest...everyone thinks stuff like this about everyone they know...but YWBTA if you tried to convince your cousin of your view, especially if your input or advice was not requested, and you know they've thought about it too. "
ajwf2l,"Nta-I’m sure your husband is right about her needing to fill a slot, but if that’s what she intended she was being slightly deceptive."
ajwghk,NTA. The fuck? You can’t even order what you want to eat for dinner without getting blown up on? I would honestly consider your position in this relationship because that’s bullshit and controlling. Are there any details you  possibly left out?
ajwgwl,NTA. Please go with her and talk to your pediatrician. They will scare the desire to hang out with the anti-vaxxers right out of your wife. Then you don't have to be the asshole!
ajwhcr,NTA. That's weird as fuck LMAO. Honestly idk what you should do here. That would be a red flag for me since it celarly shows shows she doesn't have respect for other people's privacy. Just because something is available to see doesn't mean you should look at it.
ajwhx3,"NTA. 

Friends?"
ajwina,"YTA. If she's gonna stay at her friend's house, what's the problem? To be honest, you sound kinda classist."
ajwnzj,[deleted]
ajwoyu,"YTA. Let me preface this by saying you are free to do whatever you want, it's your life. However, if you've let them think that you're on board and let them plan, organise and save to make this happen, only to pull out at the last minute, that would be an asshole move. Especially since you say that you pulling out would cause the entire trip to be cancelled. If you have objections you need to bring them up in a timely manner. Leaving it until it's too late for them to try and make other arrangements and salvage the holiday isn't a nice way to treat people who are supposed to be your friends. You also need to consider the effect that this may have on your friendships with these people. If they're hyped about it, only to have the whole thing cancelled a month out, there's a good chance they're going to resent you for it."
ajwr9b,"NTA. Firstly, why was an 8 year old at a 9.30pm showing? You don’t expect young kids at those shows. Secondly, his dad ought to be teaching him to be respectful of others. I hate it when people use the ‘well I bought this ticket’ excuse. Yes, so did I, and your kid is ruining it for me - perhaps you’ll give me a refund?! "
ajwtzc,"NTA but at the same time. I would advise you to forgive -  not for him but for yourself. Holding onto anger with no purpose is detrimental to your health.  While your situation is unique in that you have a deformity, what you describe (bullying) happens in some form every day and has been going on forever.  Rather than wallow in anger, channel your feelings into something productive (maybe work with  middle/high schoolers in an anti bullying program) "
ajwy26,"NTA. You told her your terms and she ignored them. That's annoying. If you feel bad about it later, unblock her and apologize? Since she didn't respect your request the first time, I doubt she'll be rational to have a conversation with after the incident. "
ajwyj5,"NAH. Just humor her and don't take any of this personally. She is old and probably a bit crazy. But she does sound like she cares about you. She won't be around forever and it might sound strange, but enjoy the crazy while you can."
ajwzy1,"Nta, how dare he come at you and use transphobic language. Your family, especially your sister should be absolutely enraged that he dared do that to you. She should dump him for being so transphobic tbh."
ajx4cs,"NAH. 

Your married friend knowingly hired a non-professional and paid accordingly, and your husband still did work on the day. Unless there was a contract dictating when he would have them ready there is no need to refund (though it sounds like your husband is offering it voluntarily).

Also unless you forgot to mention it, the married couple isn't pressing for a refund? Seems like an asshole free situation!"
