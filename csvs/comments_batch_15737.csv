ajx7gj,"YTA - first of all you’re in no position to diagnose psychosis, and this doesn’t sound anything like psychosis. 

Second, the fact you grieved in an odd way for your grandparent is unrelated to her grief, her reaction is a lot more normal than yours. 

But lastly and most importantly, let people grieve however the fuck they want, it has almost no effect on you, your reaction to distress should not be annoyance."
ajxbf8,"ESH

This is stupid teenage drama, you're all assholes and once you grow up, you'll realize how stupid this was. "
ajxccg,"NTA.  Also - did he grab her and force a makeout or read the moment wrong and went in for a peck? I don’t see how the peck scenario would be cause for expulsion or really “sexual assault”.,. 

Chasing someone naked and ejaculating on their clothes is definitely a bit more assaulty.  Don’t think that’s a word but you catch my drift.  "
ajxfsq,"NTA

But I don't blame your grandma/family for being confused and angry. They don't know what's going on. They see you as the hostile and distant one. They have no context to understand what's going on with you or why you're treating them like you are.

I would encourage you to start opening up and seeking help in some safe environment (support group, therapy, etc) and to possibly discuss the past with your family.  They won't be able to help you if ghey don't know what's wrong.

"
ajxgla,"NTA, I have a grandma and grandaunt that are just like your great grandma. Some people become wise when they are old, some become bitter, you got the bitter one on your hands....also if she is breaking your families bank she needs to be put into a home....that's what they are somewhat for."
ajxnx9,"NTA. 

You're letting this overly offended culture make you insecure when performing mundane actions.

You held a door open.. if that ruined anyone's day, they were already miserable and just looking for a reason..

"
ajxrku,"NTA, this was a stranger. You aren't obligated to donate to every GoFundMe link that comes your way. 

For your friend to block you for this shows you what kind of friend he is, and where his priorities are. "
ajxslr,Might be the frustration talking. But you should let him know how you feel especially when hes that old he should acknowledge how you feel.
ajxt22,"NTA

Also you shouldn’t want to get a refund. Why let the government earn interest on your money? If you are getting money back, your employer isn’t taking enough off annually. 

I have never heard of anyone being upset about having more income. 

Edited: I shouldn’t respond late at night. If you are getting money back- the employer is taking TOO much off of your pay. Not the other way around like I stated above. That didn’t even make sense. "
ajxt4t,"NTA anything over 45 min is unacceptable unless they call you explain a situation and ask you if you still want it. But 3 hours without calling and letting you know why? Don’t take it don’t eat it and don’t pay for it. I had a similar situation a few years ago, and then even got a call from the owner asking me to take the food and pay for it. I did not and i had ordered almost weekly from that store before. They lost a customer that day."

What he is doing is animal abuse and is illegal. He should not be allowed to own animals if he can't take care of them."
ajyxew,"NTA
This actually got me kinda mad
1. It’s your body and you can choose to deal with your period however the F you want
2. It clearly hasn’t affected him until you told him so it’s not his opinion to give
3. And if he’s actually mf making fun of you for being a feminist that’s ridiculous, we live in a day and age where you can be a woman who does whatever you want and there’s never anything wrong for being a feminist
4. Also if he really wants you to stop just make him buy all your pads/tampons, they’re expensive he clearly doesn’t understand that.

Edit:spelling

ajyxro,NAH it would be creepy if you were intentionally spying on her but you went out of your way to avoid her. Tbh you probably could have said hi and it still wouldn't have been creepy. You seem like a good person! Definitely not an asshole.

ajzbe1,"I’m sorry, you’re the asshole. In a regular relationship, communicating about how you two argue is really healthy. But I’ll be honest, if my partner was prone to punching walls every two weeks, I would be terrified and not at all open to negotiate. I’d be getting out of that situation quick smart. I’m glad you recognise that your behaviour is your responsibility, and I want to just note that even if you don’t hit your partner, this still counts as domestic abuse and you should consider getting some help to find new coping strategies.

ak065a,"YTA. You saw a free ride and decided it was too good to refuse. You knowingly used emotion to guilt-trip someone into doing something he didn't want to do. Be honest, the trip isn't for him... Its for you. Manipulating anyone into actions they wouldn't otherwise take is assholeish behavior. You are indeed the asshole here."
ak09mb,"SHP

First time using this ruling. Might just be a lack of relevant information, but it strikes me as odd that you had access to the equipment to properly euthanize a cat. 

Also, weird that you keep saying that you ""destroyed"" the cat."
ak0g92,"YTA. He is clearly excited about this game and wanted a good experience with it, you messed up the experience he wanted to be perfect. Apologise and do what you can."
ak0kve,You want control over your partner's thoughts?   Good luck with that.

ak0nc8,NTA-If the family can comfortably pay for the trip they shouldn’t be taking charity.
ak0u9j,"NTA, what is his problem? I've been a heavy drinker and I wasn't pissing everywhere even at my drunkest. The guy has an issue that he needs to deal with. "
ak0zkc,"Yikes, YTA.

The non-asshole way to do what you did would be to say ""Excuse me, I'd love to give some positive feedback to your manager if they are available,"" not dangle the idea that you were going to make a complaint in front of that poor minimum wage worker's face.

You were showboating. It was more of a stunt than a genuine compliment and I wouldn't be impressed either if I was your date.

Edit: I wonder if you are also the kind of guy who would pull the ""five singles on the table"" act..."
ak0zzb,NTA. If it was a fundraiser maybe. But things cost money. 
ak13fx,"NTA - Although their intentions were ""good"", its probably important to share anything that involves a close family member's health to other family members. Family is above anything else, and I'm pretty sure the school would understand if you had to take some time off."
ak1ls2,"NTA, she sounds like someone I'd steer clear of. You apologized, I'm not sure why, considering she was rude and hitting you before calling her a bitch and escalating even worse when you stuck up for yourself. "
ak1rvk,"NAH -- I do think you're borderline YTA. Mostly because your reaction was disproportionate to the action. He was kissing you passionately and doing things he enjoyed. THe appropriate response is to have an ADULT conversation right after and express your viewpoints.

&#x200B;

WHile you like aggressive sex, he may not.  Think about his viewpoints. He may like gentle sex and you stormed off based on your needs alone

&#x200B;

I have no idea why you're ignoring him now either. You're basically ignoring him for something relatively minor"
ak1rze,"YTA. At that point it was “months” before you and her decided to pursue the relationship, she was free to sleep with who she likes. I do understand though that it can be really upsetting to find out that she may have felt less strongly about you than you did about her, but you still have no real right to be angry at her because she hasn’t cheated or done anything wrong. 

YTA for lying to her in this situation. I think you lied to push her away - you didn’t want to think about her anymore so you lied to her that you’d slept with someone else so that she would leave you alone. You specifically say you did it out of ‘spite’ - you knew how much it would hurt YOU if SHE did that (point proven when she DID sleep with someone else) and you WANTED to hurt her to make it easier for you to push her away. Which was selfish and makes you an asshole. 

You owe her an apology, and I don’t think you have a real reason not to pursue the relationship because of this because she hasn’t cheated. Remember that just because she was able to sleep with someone else doesn’t necessarily mean that she got over you , it was a one night stand. Sometimes people have one night stands because they’re lonely and missing someone in particular. You wouldn’t be an asshole if you still wanted to break up with her though, it’s up to you. 

Sorry this is so long, hope it gives you some different perspectives!"
ak20f0,"NTA but this sort of thing should be figured out in advance. Not sure what the arrangements have been the numerous times you helped out, but it is reasonable to have others help you out in the same way on occasion. "
ak299v,"NTA. Sounds like she can't handle you becoming an adult and is infantilising you. Point out that when she asks everyone if you have already said hello or goodbye to because ""she never greets everyone"" she looks like a fool and an asshole."
ak2fft,"NTA- you are Youre sons mother and shouldn’t feel guilted into doing ANYTHING that isn’t a basic need for him.

MILs have a way of being like this. Idk why. Tell her to come over this this time and next time you will come to her house. 

My personal theory with MILs is they like to have things happen at their house so they have a bit more control over the situation. Kind of a their house their rules type deal. My MIL is a nice person but she has issues with letting go and forgetting that she is GRANDMA and NOT mom."
ak2ift,"NTA. It's absolutely understandable why you don't want her to move in, and honestly a smart move. Her financial situation and unwillingness to try to move forward could end up being a big strain on your relationship, especially if she moves in, and as you said, a separation would be difficult if she isn't financially independent. Also, moving in with some one isn't an easy thing to adjust to, even with financial stability. "
ak30q7,"YTA.

For future reference, being courteous and ignoring someone else's fashion faux pas is not being a pussy. "
ak30qz,"NAH, it's your body, you do what you want with it, but you gotta understand that your friend, she's worried for you because you barely eat.
Try to think in her point of view, how would you react if your friend intentionally starve herself to lose weight?"
ak33d7,"NTA

They lied to manipulate you and if they are pathological liars then it sounds like you have more issues than just that... 

Check our r/raisedbynarcissists btw :)"
ak33h1,NTA.  They were provided numerous options for space.  Unless other groups have requested and received specific separate meeting areas - he’s not got a leg to stand on.   He’s entitled to space.  Not the creation of new space specifically for his needs.  
ak3ia3,"NTA - you're no longer dating, he no longer has a say in your romantic life"
ak3n9z,"YTA. When someone’s tired, even a phone call for a few minutes feels like a chore because you just want to rest. He told you that and you still pushed. It was rude of him to hang up but be a little more considerate next time. "
ak3vgy,YTA in my opinion. You totaled your car in an accident that was your fault. You decided to get an older car of the same one you had even though the value of it couldn’t have been much. You should’ve seen some of the damage when you bought it. Your husband took several weeks off work to help you. He probably can’t take time off to pick up your car without putting his job at risk. Also you took Ubers and trains to get to chemo which is more serious I think. 
ak43ts,"YTA mainly. No clue if she cheated, in which case ESH but the way you handled this affects both her and a future kid who had no say in the matter.

(Did you ever tell her about the vasectomy? If not- that’s also shitty. You were together a year.)"
ak48wi,"NAH - If you aren’t mocking her there is nothing wrong with correcting her professionally when the pronunciation matters. 

Her resistance to help and proper preparation is ridiculous. She can’t just expect the whole world to accept her quirk when it could easily be overcome. And if that’s what she expects then she should expect to get laughed at periodically. "
ak4gu6,NTA - Don’t even need to read this. Never okay to open a credit card in someone else’s name.
ak4j0w,"YTA. Majorly. From what you've said (and correct me if I've misunderstood) is that you're basically using general hobbies to rope people into religion. They don't like it and are trying to tell you that, but you aren't listening. How WOULD you feel if someone did the same to you with atheist meetings/beliefs? "
ak4ot9,"YTA. 

You pretended to want to be friends so that you could go out with her. Then when she said she didn’t want to be more than friends, you told her to fuck off, that you don’t want to be her friend. Dick move.

Check out /r/niceguys

You certainly sound like one to me."
ak4ym5,"NTA

This guy refuses to stop making offensive jokes and now refuses to do his work, all because you reported him.

Fuck him, let the guy dig his hole."
ak50if,"NAH

Everyone is stressed probably by the weird money situation. Sounds like you need to have a talk with her but neither of you is really being an asshole on purpose. If you haven't spoken to her yet it's a bit unfair for you to feel resentful. Just communicate! If she doesn't listen then she's TA but give her a chance."
ak51ya,"NTA but some info needed here. Did you guys let them know you were headed out to get some fresh air and to get away from the loud music for a bit? I don't see it as being a huge deal, but it does feel a bit rude if you guys didn't mention you were heading out for a bit, considering the whole point of the outing was to celebrate with the birthday girl. I can feel your pain though. I can't stand the loud noise and crowds for long so I tend to wander off for a bit here and there, with a little assurance that I'll come back. Sometimes people take that as me not having fun or being interested in what's going on with them, but in reality I just get overwhelmed by that stuff easily. "
ak55p0,"NTA

I can definitely understand why you wanted to express your concerns as good sized alligators like the one you described can be dangerous. After reading your post I did some research to see what a safe observation range would be and I found a CBS article suggesting that you should be at least 40ft away from a gator as they are capable of lunging themselves as far as around 20ft when striking. That being said I have heard that American Alligators are a lot more mild tempered than most other crocodilians and are less likely to attack unless provoked so if you ever see one laying around you wouldn’t necessarily have to book it to a safe position right away. All said I do agree that your family should have given it more space as attack do happen but I wouldn’t raise my voice bc of it as not only would that make a scene but if could as disturb the gator and cause it to behave more defensively.

ak5bgz,"YTA - It's okay that you're not attracted to her, but just because you don't want to bone her doesn't mean she's not a person with feelings deserving of basic human decency. Come on, dude, get yourself together."
ak5e2b,"They see it as unfair to them because their father wouldn't support them in the same way which is very valid. It is unfair that he refuse to pay for his other childrens education but agree to finance your child because you see her as better. You obviously keep the stepkids separate from you kid which is bullshit and not okay in anyway. You should be able to care about them and their feelings just as much, and if not definitely do not voice it to them. You think of them as lesser than your daughter simply because she is your daughter and they biologically aren't yours. YTA for blatantly showing favoritism and disregarding them as drama seeking when they have a valid jealousy. You and your ex should pay instead of you and your husband if possible."
ak5mhb,"ESH what she said was rude and deeply inconsiderate if she knows about your aspirations, but you really need to learn to cool your temper. Losing your shit at her and calling her and her friends pigs makes isn't really a healthy way of coping with negative interactions. "
ak5pam,"YTA. That's fucked. You're gaslighting him. Pranks like that are funny on The Office, not in real life."
ak60tt,"YTA. She was right there, how could you NOT ask her opinion? You do understand that she has to look at them too, right? Regardless of how much/little she 'cares', it's at the very least simply common courtesy to ask your partner WHO IS STANDING RIGHT THERE if they like your selection."
ak61og,YTA for not signing a song to him if that was an option all along
ak64gk,"NTA

It's common courtesy to give someone the flight number and info when your relying on them for a ride.  This seems shady and juvenile."
ak64y2,"Of course not! In fact, your BF should have filled it before returning it. That's just common courtesy.

If you ask him to fill it up, pay close attention to how he responds. You will learn a lot about his character in his answer."
ak67no,"YTA - Holy shit my dude, you don't ""alleviate"" a situation by ganging up with the people who are being dicks about your GF's skin color, ESPECIALLY if you're white and your GF comes from a culture with such problems with colorism. My best friend growing up is Indian and her mother legit rubbed lemon juice on her face so she would be lighter, even though it burned her. If you don't understand why a brown person making fun of a white person in a system where whiteness is rewarded and brownness is seen as a disadvantage is not the same as a white person making fun a brown person I don't know what to tell you. On the bright side, now that you know it's not cool, you have the chance to talk to your girlfriend about it (listen, don't just talk or try to justify) and let your family know they need to level-up, too. Good luck!"
ak68iu,"NTA. Maybe chat to a few others who you know want to donate but don't particularly support the NRA and see if you can all contribute to a ornament for his grave or something. Failing this, see if there's a workers' union or something in your area that you can donate to to prevent negligence/accidents in the workplace and improve industrial standards in future"
ak69rb,"NTA its their job to tell you if they're out of something, not your job to get up and ask if its ready as long as you didn't throw a tantrum, nta."
ak6jkr,"YTA, all they did was offer to participate in the church activities which you had already refused to do yourself due to your injury. Plus, you mentioned that it only takes about 5 minutes to do. How big of a baby does a person have to be to get offended by this? Even if what they were participating in took 30 minutes, sure, it could have been awkward to be by yourself, but come on dude, the world doesn't just stop turning because your leg is hurt. They by no means ""abandoned"" you. "
ak6npt,"YTA

Any time you fuck, there's a risk of pregnancy. ""Financial abortion"" is not real. You say you were ""fairly strict"" with contraceptives, did you always use a condom?

edit: all that said, you can absolutely choose to stay out of the child's life, but you're still legally responsible for some amount of child support, most likely. You should call a lawyer."
ak6qli,"NTA

It's understandable that your feelings are hurt.  Your brother should have insisted that you be part of the day.  He just blamed it on his wife instead, which is a dick move."
ak6u1p,[deleted]
ak6uev,"YTA for doing that in a parking lot. The lesson the kid is learning is that it’s okay do to potentially irresponsible things around other cars/people. You may be the best driver in the world but the kid doesn’t know that, and it’s possible they’ll want to try the same thing when they can drive but end up crashing into a car or worse. 

The outcome was fine but something could have gone wrong and ruined someone’s day. It’s better to drive responsibility around kids, even if it’s tempting to show a cool trick. "
ak6zi2,"NTA. Many homeless people could have mental issues that cause them to escalate in any confrontation(didn't a woman get stabbed when she stopped to give a homeless man something recently). 

He started being aggressive and cussing y'all out first. As a homeless person he has been rejected in worse ways than a simple hand wave. Ignoring, but also making sure you are safe(which you were doing by grabbing your boyfriend), is what you should do at all times."
ak6zkl,"NTA

Not cool that your family is essentially complaining that your disability inconveniences them. "
ak7062,"NAH. I dont know how long your mom and this guy have been dating (at least a year and a half if he was around while you were pregnant). He seems very excited to have a 'grandchild' and, in that excitement, is becoming overbearing. Im sure he has the best of intentions in mind and does not mean to cause you the extra stress.

You, also, have every right to put your foot down on every last thing concerning your son. Hes definitely infringing on your space and not respecting your wishes. Its annoying, rude and probably tiresome!

Try one last time but see if your mom may be able to get through to him. No more money, no more extravagant gifts, no more help unless explicitly asked for, no more self-given titles regarding his relationship and the baby. You are the parent and you feel smothered by him, so some space to breathe would be best for all parties involved or you may just blow a fuse. "
ak7mgt,"You're not an asshole, but you are definitely short sighted. 

When layoffs come, who do you think goes first? The guy who's just ok at his job, or the guy who's good at his job, but nobody likes him?

ak7ngp,NAH. You both have valid viewpoints and valid reasons. You just have to figure out some sort of compromise together.
ak7scn,"NTA

By your telling, you were very polite, didnt make a scene, and asked if they would like feedback [personally I wouldn't offer feedback myself, but hey, that's me]. You even called ahead to see if they had options for you!

The boss is being overdramatic. Just because she wouldn't speak up about the food doesnt mean others can't.

Now if you were being obnoxious, loud, or rude while talking to the waitstaff, then yes, I'd call you an asshole."
ak7v2t,YTA for not seeing that this girl is using you to make the other guy jealous. 
ak7xaf,"""AITA for taking an animal for necessary veterinary care for which I'm paying the entire bill?""

ak8563,"ESH (well, you and the cat-callers; not the victims obviously). If you're trying to help ""girls,"" and ""girls"" are telling you that you're making it worse, then believe them and stop. Since you didn't, it sounds like you're not doing it for them, you're doing it to make yourself feel productive or tough or whatever. Also what makes you think cat-callers would be dissuaded by a guy booing at them? You're not hanging around long anyway, and like, what are you gonna do?"
ak85si,"NTA. Confused, ignorant of plain facts, and possibly desperate, but *not* an asshole. She isn't into you, dude. She's made it clear that she *does not* value you. Find someone who will. "
ak88z3,"NTA. First of all, for any kind of relationship, they are not obligated to anything. You don't have to be this guy's friend and I encourage you to speak up to the counselor. 

I'm sorry that you have been dealing with this alone and I think you do need to talk to someone about this before all this repressed frustration and negative emotions push you into doing something you don't want to. There are communities both online and on call to help you with this. I hope that you never feel the push to self-harm and right now the first step is to cut ties with CF. Then focus on yourself, you aren't being selfish or in the wrong,  you take care of your own mental health.

Remember one thing: You don't owe them or anyone a friendship. "
ak8bmz,"Cool.  I don’t know what you expect anyone to say.  There’s no congratulations waiting for you.  You called someone with brown skin “burnt”

You would have to have not just a racist upbringing, but a really fucked up, abusive upbringing to excuse this by any means.

The right thing to do wasn’t hedging your bets, or sitting on the fence.  You easily could have said “hey, I know this is something that we joke about and don’t take seriously, but when <person> is around, I don’t want to hear any of it.  It’s not ok.  She deserves your respect just like anyone else."
ak8cq4,"YTA

Only a little bit though. You aren't obligated to go but friends should support each other even if they have to walk in the cold for a bit. That's why you're a little bit of an asshole, just cause it was something he wanted you to go to and you're friends but you left him hanging"
ak8dia,"NAH

It's just a thing they do. Loads of places have tip jars for no reason. This is just the electronic version of that.

ak8e0a,"NAH - you can’t help someone if you’re not okay yourself and you’re allowed to put yourself first and have your limits. IMO, you should just tell your friend how talking about that makes you feel, so he won’t get angry or feel abandoned, instead of just drifting away from him. "

ak8n17,"YTA but only for how you reacted, not why. Your reasoning is okay but it's never okay to blow up on someone. You've never talked to him about his immaturity so how was he supposed to know it bothered you?"
ak8oif,"NAH, you made an honest mistake, but you did end up costing him a lot of money, so this one might not be worth fighting over. Just swallow the extra few minutes if it means keeping a good client you messed up with. "
ak8vrm,"NTA - Since you are the student and not the one forking out the money, the school was right to approach your parents. Since we cannot know the tone or manner in which this was brought up with them, we don't know how the school is going about this. I would say that unless your parents specifically mention being lower income or request payment assistance, the school will probably assume that you are able to pay it. I would suggest that you let your parents deal with this, but suggest that they talk to the school about their financial situation and see if there is an option for you as a lower income student. "
ak94d6,"Could be YTA it depends on your group of friends, but the social convention is you suggest shots the round is on you. "

She brought this shit on herself. And assaulted you. In my honest opinion, you should have pressed charges. And as long as your bf is on your side, you really don't have anything to worry about. She can fuck right off. "
ak9cda,"NTA. How long has she even known him? There is no reason for some guy she is just friends with to be in the wedding, or even be invited to. Especially if she admitted that there is sexual tension between them. Like, holy shit, that is begging for trouble. Are you trying to be a cuckold? Be strong; stand up for yourself.

There is no reason for you to feel bad about not wanting him there, and she will be an asshole if she can't recognize that."
ak9dmd,"NTA. from what i can see your grandparents promised you an essential thing, basically, and your father, for what seems like an inconsequential reason, decided to fuck you over. my parents supported me through college too, so i know how helpful that is and you should be grateful for that, but that’s it’s own thing, and shouldn’t be mixed with this. your dad was being selfish, and by adding this unnecessary stigma to you in your grandparents eyes, he’s hurt you.

avoiding your grandparents is another situation though. i wouldn’t outright write them off, and maybe exhibit caution in your interactions for a while, but still take some time to talk to them. unless they bring up the car, don’t mention it. if they do mention it, try to explain the minority of your actions, but don’t make excuses. 

i hope your surgery helps. sleep apnea is a son of a bitch. "
ak9grs,NTA. Get that money

ak9j5w,Esh-it seems like a lose lose situation. She is not taking others into consideration and you would be making a big deal out of nothing. 
ak9kze,NAH but honestly your friend probably already hears this constantly. I decided not to go to collage and the unsolicited advice I constantly get can be pretty frustrating.
ak9kzx,"NTA

No, so in that small way your husband is NTA. 2. Is it fair for your best friend (I.e. spouse) to be left hanging despite you knowing they are distress? No. 

Sounds like your husband is never available emotionally and only reacts to what you do and offers nothing.

Why are you married? Not trying to be rude. I know I could be married to someone overseas indefinitely when I was 25."

This is classic teenage girl stuff, especially first generation teenage girl stuff. These high school girls will evaporate in a few years, and they all hate each other anyway. Your father loves you and you've hurt him. Apologize, try to make it right and sleep safe in the knowledge that people who would judge your father for working hard to give you a better life are not people whose opinion matters much of anything."

akaa6f,"ESH, but I think this is far too complicated for a simple judgement. You don’t sound like a bad guy, but if you’re wife isn’t comfortable with your actions then you’re stepping over the line as she is the victim. Your FIL, BIL, and MIL are all assholes and should be in prison. But you’re not helping your wife or her sisters by fighting. You should’ve spoken to an attorney instead of CPS, and you should try and get them some help through a therapist. But you also don’t have to associate with any of them, and should have an honest conversation with your wife about what you did and why, and what she would like you to do going forward. "

Your sister made you listen to hate crime invoking music and you called her out for it.

Just because there is a history of hate crime makes it even worse and she is trying to use that as justification for it. Honestly I'd cut ties with your sister when possible I would prefer not being around someone who is openly okay with me being raped for my sexual preference, she's homophobic to say the least.

akbjvt,"Tentative vote: ESH

She checks in a lot and nags you for details of what you’re doing ... and then when she offers you details of what *she* is doing, you tell her you don’t want to know.

That’s not a double standard, that’s you guys having completely opposite ideas of “correct” behaviour.  She’s treating you like she wants to be treated.  And vice versa.   You two need to start treating the other person how *they* want to be treated.   

That means she shuts up about her details (because you don’t want to hear them).   And you need to volunteer more of your details to her (because she does want to hear them.)"

That's highly invasive, and frankly kind of creepy what they did. So an adult didn't call you back cuz they were busy. So tf what?? Your family can buzz off cuz you are apparently fine, and they're just freaking out over nothing. If my family pulled this crap they'd be cut off instantly. Suicide attempts a decade ago do not mean you get to blow up my spot now. That's ridiculous.

I can understand being close to family n all, but holy crap if my mom went on a crusade to ""check up on me"" to literally everyone I know (including your landlord?? Why does she have their number???

akd5ah,"NAH, Major miscommunication from both sides.

Your motives were genuine and your idea was backed by the others at your table (passing their ashhole filters). Looking at how she reacted it's possibly you misunderstood the context. 

Maybe she looked uncomfortable in the beginning, but the dude put her at ease by having a normal conversation with her. 

Maybe she looked uncomfortable because she likes the guy and you saw her getting nervous.

Maybe she looked uncomfortable because she wanted to be left alone by everyone.

By walking over, you put her in a socially awkward lose-lose situation. Even if she wanted to escape her convo with the dude, by agreeing to your invitation it would have been an unspoken rejection of the dude. 

The defensiveness of her reaction might mean that, while a conversation with that dude is not what she wanted, creating a possible conflict would feel a lot worse. This is the reason why I'm not viewing her as an ashhole either - simply a surprised, frightened cat lashing out emotionally.

When it settles down you could try to talk it out, but it's not that big a deal. You tried being a good person, don't let this get you down. Maybe try making the escape route more subtle in future rescue missions, allowing the other to save face no matter the decision. "

akdkg4,"NTA 

The nastiest of nasty comes out of people when there’s a large estate on the table. It happens time and time again. This is very common. 

Keep doing what you’re doing and don’t let *anyone* interfere with your legal right and responsibility to handle this. If you need to cut them off until it’s all over, do it. 

I have family members who openly said that they would tear the family apart and drag everyone down with them if they didn’t get my grandmother’s beach house after she died. People are crazy. I never talked to them again. "
akdsdc,"YTA, but not because you fucked your friend the next day.  You're the asshole because you broke up with your boyfriend via text message and not in person.  Being in a hurry to have sex with someone else is no excuse for not breaking up face-to-face.  That's what it amounts to, you were eager to have sex with your friend, so you couldn't wait to tell your boyfriend in person and sent him a text message instead.  Yes, for this, you're the asshole.

Also, you're 15.  Stop having sex on impulse before you get pregnant or catch an STD and ruin the rest of your life.  Hormones are crazy powerful, but don't let them wreck your life."

ake38w,"NTA obviously. I'm not surprised the kid's so entitled after hearing about its parent's attitude towards the whole thing. It's kinda pointless to try to reason with YC since she's just 8, and it's also clearly pointless to try to reason with the parents, so I think the best course of action would be to keep the cold shoulder treatment and ignore the kid until something changes."
ake3xr,YTA. I'm straight and have been to pride. Get over yourself. 
ake6gt,"NTA -- your friend's response was very passive aggressive and was an attempt to make you feel bad.

ake8sz,"Mate, you're definitely NTA for wanting to not be your wife's ""wallet with legs."" You need to find marriage counseling, but you also need to ask yourself what the actual state of your relationship is, and whether this can continue or not. To me, that double-standard sounds pretty toxic."

akf1so,"YTA.

Not for refusing to let him in (although it seems a bit harsh to refuse), but for making drama over a totally insignificant event and wanting to go to this guy's place of work to have it out with him. You sound aggressive asf about essentially nothing.

He said something about standing in the rain...so what? Doesn't sound like he was being rude or confrontational, poor guy was just wet and made a passing comment.

Edit: So despite the overwhelming response on here calling YTA, you still went to the guy's place of work and caused trouble! Why even ask people if you're just going to continue to be an asshole?

But PLEASE tell his fiancé that he was cheating. Do it anonymously, do whatever, but please tell her. Like you said before, you don’t think it’s right for him to trick her into something as serious as marriage, and she should know his previous actions. He also might have risked her sexual health, which puts her at risk for STD’s she might not know about for years. He’s deluded her into thinking he’s someone she can trust, which is not the case. 

I’m pretty sure that anyone (including myself) would want to know this information before committing to marriage. She will find out, but the later it is the more devastating it will be. Heartbreak now will save the thousands of dollars in wedding planning, mortgages, potential kids and divorce proceedings down the line. "
akh3rn,"NTA. Who cares if they did it unintentionally? They don't value your friendship and presence and frankly, you shouldn't waste time on people who can't be bothered to spend time with you.

Just a small smidge of advice, though. Don't unfriend people you want to cut off from your life. It creates unnecessary drama and often reeks of attention seeking behavior. Unfollow them on fb if you need to, but wasting your time unfriending people just to prove to them that you don't consider them to be your friend anymore is a bit childish. "
akh3rt,"NTA. It sounds as though you're private about your personal life, and that's okay. It doesn't sound like you're actively hiding the fact you have a girlfriend--you just don't want to post pictures of yourself out there for the world. Nothing wrong with that.

If she wants to half ass move in, she could at least offer to half ass help with utilities. If she won’t, you can discuss with your roommate about covering the gap.

The argument that family is more important than your boundaries is shit. You should share because of wanting to do something nice with/for someone, not because your blood is kinda similar to theirs.

However, the way you acted throughout this whole situation was very childish and immature.

For that reason, if it were me, I'd apologize (and wait for an apology back)."

akjw77,"This is a psychological shit show...

YTA - This happened to her when she was young and has most likely given her intimacy and psychological issues that she is working through.

I'm sorry your mother is making you uncomfortable, but you are absolutely well within your rights to draw a firm line right now. "
akl4f1,"NTA

Yielding the right away when it's clearly yours is the wrong thing to do. It doesn't make someone nice, it demonstrates that they don't know how to drive and they are creating unpredictable situations that make driving more dangerous.  It will also make it YOUR fault if there is an accident. 

For example, you have a stop sign and they don't, but they wave you on?  You pulling out into the intersection and getting hit (by them or someone else) is completely your fault. Never take the wave-in. Sit there until the idiot who doesn't know how to drive is gone. "
akl69q,SHP; validation post; obviously NTA.
akl8gz,"NTA, but as somebody who really values physical affection, I know it would be very hurtful to feel like my affection was being constantly rebuffed by my partner. It might be worth it to talk it out with him and see if there's some other activity to show your affection which you would both be comfortable with, even like holding hands or giving a massage or something else of that nature."
aklexq,"NTA. Your boyfriend is being inconsiderate in a lot of ways, especially if this is a regular thing. Is something maybe going on with him? I had some behavior like this in a relationship where I was having depressive mood swings which made doing things throughout the day difficult.

If that's not the problem, I would try and be a little more assertive about what you want. For example, when he asked if it's okay to go play Overwatch you really should have just said no and asked him to spend time with you instead if that's what you wanted. It's possible he's unintentionally being an asshole."

akm05h,"NAH -- Let me introduce you to the greatest thing for relationships since separate blankets: The Venting Advisory. Before you vent, you gotta put a little disclaimer at the top ""Venting Advisory. I don't want to debate or get advice or do anything but get this off my chest and possibly be told that everyone else in the history of the world is always wrong except for me. This has been your Venting Advisory""

As long as you keep the Advisory lighthearted and pick your battles (you can't blow someone's phone up every day just to vent if that's not what the other person's into) it works wonders. By saying what you're looking for at the very beginning, you're setting everyone up for success, so you can save the fights and the debates for things that you actually want to go to the mat about."
akm237,"NTA. If your mom agreed to it beforehand and you've already bought expensive tickets, she should definitely do it unless there's an emergency. Don't rely on her again like this, it's not worth it."

Kind of. 

Do you have separate invites for day and evening guests? Invite them to the evening reception of your wedding, just not the ceremony. It's not like it'll cost you anything extra if you're not providing them with a meal.

akmbuk,"NTA - her argument is bogus, she had the bed while you also had a bed. So there’s no issue, it was rightfully yours.

Being rude was wrong and you could have been more diplomatic but you’re in the right here. She was not only very selfish and completely illogical in demanding to keep the bed."
akmoop,"NAH - she just doesn't understand. It's not your fault or hers, hopefully you can explain it to her in a way that makes sense to her."
akms0o,You would be. Just tell her that you are uncomfortable with what she tells you about them. It is her life so she can talk to whomever she likes
akmwmt,"NTA. Your sister is the obvious asshole. BUT you definitely could have stood up for your gf in a more constructive way. Now your sister feels like she's in the right becuase of how you called her out - she's going to focus on how you yelled at her and called her a bitch rather than how she actually made your gf feel and how hurtful that is to both of you which is super unfortunate. I think you should talk with her about it and be like ""look, I'm sorry I lashed out, but can you see how what you did was super hurtful and not ok?""  


Side note though, your gf sounds super cute and you sound like a great guy and a great boyfriend and I'm glad you stood up for her even if the result wasn't great. I wish you both luck and I hope your gf feels better. "
akn3i0,"NTA. her problems aren't automatically your problems just because she is your sister. She being manipulative and unappreciative by dismissing the help available and nitpicking.

aknfpa,"NAH. Some people’s reactions to orgasms are different than others, and if she says she’s fine and she likes it and she doesn’t appear to be disliking the sex then I would believe her. But also I 100% understand where you’re concern comes from, if I was having sex with a girl and she started crying I would think 1 of 3 things. One, does is physically hurt and is she in bad pain? Two, is this giving her thoughts of previous sexual abuse? Three, am I somehow inadvertently abusing her? Your reaction is perfectly normal "
aknfvw,NAH She’s improved. Yay for both parties. 
aknlwd,"NTA - but you handled it badly. This happened in a workplace.

She spread stuff about you in a workplace environment. That’s immediately an issue for HR. Report it, call her out for lying in a meeting with her and HR, have it documented and ‘resolved’. She either has to admit she had proof or stop spreading lies. After that, at a professional level accept the apology and let it go.

At a personal level, you’re within your right to never speak to her again. But don’t give her an excuse to say that you’re not polite in an office setting."
aknwcu,[deleted]
aknzun,"YTA. You knew she was interested. If it was nothing more than a one or two night fling for you, you shouldn’t have done it. If you actually like this guy you should’ve talked with her first.

ako3ak,"YTA - in the case of the bridal fair. Completely your own fault for getting drunk the night before, making yourself ill, and agreeing to go. You also say you were working the evening of the bridal fair and going to the fair would impact on your time to sleep? If you were meant to be sleeping don't go to a fucking party and get wasted the night before then.

For the florist that's not on you. You already had work scheduled.

She might be expecting a lot from you, which you should talk to her about if you don't think it's normal, but I still think YTA for the bridal fair situation."
ako4xh,"YTA, I could only imagine how upset I’d feel if one of my “friends” got with my mum. I get the fact that you are both consenting adults and she’s hot but come on man, put yourself in his shoes how would you feel if this was your mother and he was laying the pipe on her? "
akobfg,"NTA You don't owe the guy anything more than the friendship you have consistently offered from day one. If he's playing the awful rom-com 'persistence gets the girl' fallacy out the that's his mistake, you have been clear about your feelings and boundaries from the sounds of it. I'm sure your dad and brother mean well and love you loads but *braces for hurricane of downdoots* they don't necessarily understand the gender politics of what they are telling you and how it might feel from your end?"
akocg6,"I'd say NTA. I don't think any group is supposed to stop harmless jokes just for Kitty's sake, unless those bring up difficult memories (which doesn't seem to be the case). She either isn't in the right group, or she needs to lighten up."

akojoi,"NTA. If your BF continued to call you a name after informing him that it was offensive, he is the asshole. 

BTW... I would have said he was an asshole after the very first instance that he called you ""Fatty""."
akoq0z,"NTA, that is so so so irresponsible on his part. You may end up on bed rest with your pregnancy and he just quit the only other income you have. I'd probably have a hard time seeing him for a while after that. It's one thing if he had a very very toxic work environment and it was causing him depression but this isn't the time to job jump over small things. "
akp0so,"NTA. The whole ""you are the only one and there is no one else and I'm hopeless unless it's you"" thing is manipulative.

And I get that leaving someone who has mental issues can be hard, but dating isn't about saving people. He sounds like he wants you to save him, or that you are his only hope. 

Don't give him hope of being with you after ""fixing"" himself either because then he'll do the bare minimum to seem ""fixed"" and then you get into a relationship with him and he's got what he wants and turns back into what he is now.

He needs help."

You're 23 and your back already hurts sometimes.  How will that be when you're 27?  40?  Can you do that forever?  Will you be able to afford a family someday?  It's worth looking into online classes at a minimum so you can move to a different profession if you ever decide this isn't for you.
akpu3o,NTA. Nice of you to offer an alternative.

akq005,"NTA. It sounds like an emotionally abusive cycle that you probably want to get out of. She has low self-esteem, and so takes it out on you, then feels bad about it, then takes *that* out on you too. She's unhappy and using you as a scapegoat. Not a healthy position to be in."
akq337,"NTA.

I was having a hard time deciding so I re-read the post a couple times. 

She's your friend, and she asked you to tell her if you knew something. Now, I think from your post, we can tell that she would have gotten back together with him at some point based on their track record. Who's to say he's not fucking other women every time they break up and then going back to her. 

If he didn't want her finding out, maybe he shouldn't have stuck his dick in someone 3 days later. Lol. And yes, it's not cheating. But it's also reason #1 why she should keep him out of her life. 

He can be mad all he wants. And maybe explain to your fiance how much it would suck for the girl to go back to him AGAIN after he was banging some other chick, even if they weren't dating. "

There’s no point discussing/debating with someone who holds such an irrational belief. For your sake and his, politely back out of further discussion with him. Change the subject, or pretend you don’t have time to chat right now."
akq9wg,"ESH. If you’re questioning whether or not you’re both unhappy, the answer is clear at this point. Boundaries are important and if you two cared about each other there would be stronger ones in place. 

If you’re a good dad, your wife can not legally take your daughter from you. I’m sure she would rather grow up in homes where she feels loved and nurtured rather than living with two people who don’t love each other.

If that’s the case, you should probably see a counselor and talk about both of your feelings. They can guide you in either direction hopefully keeping it amicable and with understanding from both sides. Without help this relationship is dysfunctional at best.

Also, it’s important to ask yourself if you’re just lusting after this person because it’s new and exciting. People grow and change - however; feelings can be fleeting. "

akr94r,"YTA. As a store manager in retail reading your conversation with your peer and then your DM is sort of infuriating. You’re forgetting that they are also giving up coverage to help you. Things come up and shit happens and sometimes things have to shift on the fly, especially in retail. 

The two things you said that really make me wonder about you are the comment about you giving a day off up and that you gave up your ASM willingly. I’m salary. I’ve sacrificed when needed and have worked 14–15 days straight sometimes. It happens in retail. Your attitude about your ASM doesn’t do them justice. Clearly they earned a store on their own merit and you didn’t “give them up”.

OP, I want to share a story with you because I was in your same exact spot when I was in middle school. There was a kid that bullied me so bad, I couldn't stand going to school, and I loved school up to that point. I would go entire days not saying a word because I was afraid of being bullied for even speaking. One day, somebody pushed the bully in the hallway and he turned around and knocked my books out of my hand, so I pushed him back and he punched me in the back of the head.

With all that being said, that bully is one of my best friends now, somebody that will stand up next to me at my wedding. John is just immature right now, but eventually he's going to realize what he's doing to you is wrong. I promise you that."

This is a classic example of the ""i am a self-centered bitch who can only see the world from ny own perspective and if i do or say something i dont think its wrong then it is not wrong even though it bothers the other person"" disease. actually a huge dealbreaker for me, in friendships and relationships. seems like your so-called ""friend"" cares more about his own pride over upsetting you

imo, people! - if someone says you did something the other person doesnt like, or it bother/annoys/hurts the other person, even though you dont thinknit was wrong, just apologize and dont do it again. its hard to be always in the other person's shoes, but we have to try our best in order for relationships to be healthy"

However I also understand that your mom get’s really upset about it. Above all she is your mom, and mothers just want to have their children close to them. You not wanting to live with her makes her feel like she has done something wrong and that really upsets her. Just have good conversation with your mom, explaining why you want to live with your dad. Also, if you are going to live with your dad, make sure to visit your moms house often, this will make her feel a lot better! "

This is obviously complicated and I completely agree with you not wanting to leave your keys with a total stranger or a total stranger's reception desk, but you told your friend she could stay at your place and then you changed your mind. Again, I totally understand the reason, but you did change your mind.

At the same time, though, Arya really should have made more of an effort to get the keys from you. It's disrespectful of her to expect you to leave keys with strangers. Regardless of whether you left the keys with her friend, her friend's mom, or a receptionist, those people are all strangers to you. Could you imagine handing your keys over to a stranger on the street and saying, ""Hey, my friend is coming by in a few minutes, but I have to run. Could you make sure she gets these?"" You just wouldn't do it.

I think it's understandable that she's upset, but I think you should be, too. She really should have showed you and your place more respect, especially when you were trying to do her a favor. It didn't work out and that sucks, but it was an all around crappy situation"

That being said... I agree 100% with your mother regarding the no smoking on the property (what kind of nurse smokes when a patient could smell it on them), or eating with your family.

You won't like it that much, but it will make her happy and it'll be a good gesture to her about how you feel for her. It's not about the pictures, not about you, it's about her. It's the type of gesture that will put you miles ahead of the competition in life.

You should be listening to your mother. What she is saying is correct. You could end up being taken away from her, and know that she's not yelling at you because she's angry, shes yelling at you because she's scared. She also has every right to go through your text to make sure that someone isn't encouraging you to hurt yourself. I had a period in my life where my mom would go through my phone to make sure I was staying out of trouble and not hurting myself. 

However, she is handling the situation very poorly, and in my opinion, not reacting in a good way. What she should be doing is sitting you down, and talking to you, because you are right. Her yelling at you has done nothing but make you feel like shit, which is how this situation came around anyway. Back to what I was saying, she should being sitting you down and talking, asking you why you are doing this, what can she do to help, what do you want/need to change, and how can we start. 

Between the both of you, you need to sit down, and have a talk. Whether you start it, or she starts it, you need to sit down and talk like human beings. It is going to be terrifying, Im not going to lie to you, and if you need to, have a friend (like Jazz) sit there with you, because this is something that needs to be talked about.

 I'm not trying to say your in the wrong by getting yelled at, but she's not in the wrong by being upset. However, both of you are in the wrong in your own ways. You need to sit down, and have a very important conversation. 

Edit: I'm probably gonna be down voted for this, but I don't care. I'm going based off my experience in OPs shoes. I'm also not saying my way is the only correct way, or even a correct way to do this, but it worked pretty damn well for me. "

If she is making this reception/party something more than what you would enjoy then obviously the party is NOT about you. 

She can get the fuck over it, or not. But it is your reception  and you get to do what you want. And you aren't an asshole for that.

I’ve been downvoted for saying this before, but I highly recommend not getting in the middle of another couple’s love lives. 

Sure, ethically it might be the right thing to do, but I have consistently seen it change the dynamics of multiple friendships. I nearly lost one of my best friends when my wife at the time caught his fiancé cheating on him in a sports bar.  You risk losing a friendship each time - especially when the other partner is persuasive and manipulative. 

If you feel like you *really* need to open a friend’s eyes, plan a way for him to see it himself. Take a selfie or record them in the background of something. That way, when your friend sees it, you can say, “Zomg!  I totally didn’t notice that in the background!”  It’s hard to do, but it’s best if they can just figure it out themselves.

I could be wildly wrong though so you should definitely ask."
al74ft,"NAH. It's nice that your friends want to hang out with you in person, but you're not obligated to go if you're not up for it.

Your friends will probably find other ways to get those needs met. "
al755q,"NTA: It’s been my experience that people who interrupt either 1) Grew up in large families where they feel interrupting is the only way to be heard. 2) Think what they have to say is way more important than what you have to say. Either way, it’s rude and disrespectful. Imagine how he’d feel if you blasted an air horn each time he attempted to speak? 

You were right to call him on it. Better he recognizes the bad habit now and corrects it than letting it continue for years to come. Being married to someone who invalidates your words with their own is not a formula for a happy union. "

Your concern for your mums wellbeing is admirable considering so many people would go straight down the nursing home route.

I do see where your husband is coming from though. Having your mother in the house might make him think he’d have to be on his ‘best behaviour’ at all times and give up a certain amount of privacy.

Let him know that you're unhappy with the way he's treating you both - but please don't issue any ultimatums or do anything to force his hand. This will be difficult for your boyfriend, whatever happens, and he needs to know that you're his ally."

albv2m,"Obviously not the asshole. 

I don’t see how your wife can agree with her when it’s very clear that she was at fault. Such backward logic. I’d be insisting that she pays, if not, depending on how much it will cost I’d take her to court. If that’s possible where you are. "
alc4bq,"Your mother is definitely NTA. She has a life of her own and if she can't babysit, she can't babysit, simple as that. It sounds like your sister is being an asshole here, but honestly, it's a pretty bad situation all round. She's probably only getting pissy about stuff because she's stressed."
alc9hb,NTA. I find it concerning that your fiancé is on her mothers side in this. She obviously didn’t have an issue with your condition when she met you and got engaged to you so now it’s a problem cause he mom is threatening to not come to the wedding? Major r/justnomil right there.

alcr4g,"What’s the acronym for you aren’t a good manager yet?

Hear me out. You don’t go back and write her up for dress code violations or drinking in the past. Address things as they come up each day. It’s not really fair to not address it when it happens and then later get her in trouble for it. Also, make sure if you’re addressing her dress code issues you are addressing other people’s violations too. Shit goes all sideways when “you didn’t make him do that, why do I have to?”


I get that you don’t want a no drug policy. Therefore, you don’t write her up for drug use, you write her up for being unable to work. You need to have clear standards that you are implementing fairly. If someone else is fine stoned and she isn’t, your “out” is that you are addressing the behaviors (being unable to work) vs the cause of those behaviors. That way if she points out other stoned employees, again you address that they are functioning and doing their job while she isn’t. Likewise if someone is sick or on prescription meds. Send them home just like you would someone who’s too drunk or high to work. 

If folks know where the line is it makes it easier for everyone. They know when they will have issues and they know you will treat them fairly.

Part time realtors are the WORST and being a family friend is an multiplier to the situation.  Doing real estate on the side reeks of financial difficulty and that drama will spill over to your purchase.  If you went with Ann you'd 1000% end up not being friends with both her and your sister in law at the end of the day.  Oh and your housing situation would be buggered as well because I guarantee part-time Annie screws the pooch a few times for her first few unfortunate clients (before she quits being an agent).

alejwj,"NTA but I would be concerned about this behavior on your husband’s part. It sounds like the beginning of an emotionally abusive relationship, he’s putting you down for having a good time and trying to connect with his family and making you feel bad for telling him how that made you feel. I think about how he’s treated you, has he made you feel bad for telling him that he’s hurt your feelings? Does he make an effort with your friends and family? Does he get upset when you spend time with your friends and family? If things aren’t sitting right I would sit down and talk and consider couples therapy. "

It's totally reasonable for you to want your SO to find some healing and peace. I think you are coming from a place of love and they sound like they really do need some help as they have only stopped drinking, not faced their real underlying problems.

Your SO is being difficult but it's understandable. It's very hard for people to face their problems especially when they have been so harmfully self medicating for so long (that alone is embarrassing plus the difficulty of bringing up the things that hurt so much they had to medicate in the first place).


It takes a while to find a good therapist! And there are so many styles of therapy! Sounds like they don't need AA as much as counseling for the things that drove them to drink in the first place. Remind them of that and maybe you can offer to go together (my parents did couples counseling when my bro and I were teenagers because my brother had sooooo many issues - they weren't having marital problems but wanted to seek help as a team - maybe your SO would like if you could try this? Not sure if it applies as it is their problem but as you are so supportive maybe even just offering will help encourage them). Good luck!"

You are obviously trying to take care of your granddad as best you can, and that's all you can really do. Spending too much money right now might mean not being able to help him later, so I think you're being rational.

Sure, it sucks and it's a difficult situation but distancing oneself from toxic people isn't a bad thing.

alp6bu,"NTA

Everyone is going too easy on your husband IMO. After he had time to settle down, he not only stubbornly defended his initial reactions, but then doubled down and put all of the blame on you.

Making accusations about what you did that were exaggerated and made up (5 hours without changing), cutting you off and just telling  you that you have no excuse, telling you that you personally disrespected him because you left a diaper on too long, and then trying to rewrite history about his own actions (I wasn't yelling at you) all seem like symptoms of a much larger problem. Especially since you indicated that you two are arguing all the time these days. Is this a normal reaction for him when anything doesn't go exactly his way?

The guy kicked or threw something, in front of his 2 year old daughter, because he had to change an extra dirty diaper. It's one thing to momentarily get frustrated about something, but the way this guy has chosen to react both in the short term and longer term are very concerning to me. If I had a friend who was treating his wife that way I'd be encouraging him to get some therapy, that kind of stuff just isn't acceptable."
alpe5r,"NTA, she may not have hit you but it seems like she was pretty abusive in other ways. Your reasoning and feelings seem valid to me. You should try to have a conversation with her and see if that goes anywhere constructive. "

He came over after you told him you didn't have the time, energy, or mental space to talk to him about his issues. Didn't even bother to offer you support.

Also you didn't need to talk to him like that.

Nobody can reasonable expect someone to put them as a higher priority then their S.O. there is just so much wrong here on her end.

als85l,"YTA? Lol. This one is tough for me.

I feel like you aren't an asshole for not wanting to hang out with him but you could have handled it better. You were clearly still worked up about the fact that he didn't want to hang out with you and you felt rejected by that which is why you turned the guy down the way you did, most likely.

So, you were petty because of the past rejections and you had your chance to ""get back at him.""

Son applies himself at public school, gets into college and then told to suck it up and take out loans? I assume you’ll say the same thing to daughter in a few years? Or by then will you decide you’d better pay for her college, too? 

It’s almost like you’re trying to conduct an experiment within your own family to see how it turns out when one kid gets everything (private school, college, no loan debt) and the other has a more typical experience (Public school, collage with loan debt). Spoiler alert: the kid who works for it will probably be more successful in the long run. Also, he’ll resent you at best, for making your favorite so clear. "

Btw, lots of older couples have the rule that if one person strays, their punishment is to live in silence with the guilt rather than torpedo their marriage and separate completely. Maybe your parents had this too.

Edit: Also, for future reference, it’s not difficult to gauge someone’s preference for knowing about infidelity. My aunt cheated on my uncle and my mom had casually asked him once if he’d want to know (she framed it as asking for advice for herself). He said no, absolutely not. I’d rather she take it to the grave. So he never found out.

I don't think being passive aggressive by ignoring his messages is the way to go, it's going to instigate him further. Talk it out.  "
alyiwk,"YTA. Based on what you've said, you let your insecurities lead you to treat someone in a shitty manner. That's a dick move. Ghosting may be appropriate in some situations, but not when emotional immaturity is your only excuse.

It's reasonable to want to know what the person you're talking to looks like. Having anonymous conversations can feel unnatural when you're trying to get to know someone, so he wasn't out of line when he asked you so soon after you started chatting. Of course, it's also reasonable to refuse such a request if, for whatever reason, it made you feel uncomfortable. Chatting with you for a bit certainly doesn't make him entitled to anything.

Now, if you had been clear in your refusal instead of giving such a noncommittal answer, and he then continued to pester you for pictures, cutting contact would have been the right call. Not respecting someone's borders is a pretty big red flag. But instead you caved on the next request, knowing full well it'd make you uncomfortable. That's on you, not him. 

Setting and enforcing limits with people doesn't make you an asshole. But assuming the worst and treating a stranger discourteously for not respecting limits that have not been clearly placed definitely does."

If you couldn’t deal with your significant other being there, permanently, then you should stay single.

That’s so rude that you do that to him and I completely understand him being hurt.

You can’t have relax time when he’s there. Yeah I bet that makes him feel so welcome.


Edit: I’ve been talking to other users here and I’ve come to a conclusion.

I think you both need to sit down and talk openly and honestly about how each other is feeling.
I think his hurt has an underlying emotion to it which may be fear? A fear that you need this time away from him. A fear that he may not be good enough for you etc. he may be worried and that would cause him anxiety as well which would get worse in the long run.

I’m worried he may be getting depressed each time he has to leave because he doesn’t fully understand WHY you need this time.

I do still believe it’s harsh but I think if you both have a deeper understanding of each other then it’s better going forward. 
I think that my thinking it’s rude is because he doesn’t have a full understanding of what is going on inside your head.  We don’t know what’s going on until it’s spelled out.

I have a biased opinion because when I need that time, I do go for a walk to clear my mind (I deal with anxiety issues) and I think my SO and I have a very open and clear understanding of each other’s needs and emotions. But that’s over 15 years."
am0n38,"NAH - Situations like this are incredibly complicated and you did what you thought was right for her. You delayed breaking up with her until you felt she was strong enough to deal with the break up by herself. I can't fault the logic and I think you did the right thing.

My advice would be to stay clear for a good length of time as you being around straight away will give her false hope and could nurture dependance. Although emotionally it might feel like the wrong thing to do I think you need to explain to her that you can't see her any more and you won't be replying to her messages. After a certain amount of time meet up with her for a coffee and you'll be able to judge whether a friendship is possible. It's always difficult to judge the length of time to leave it as it depends on the length of the relationship and the type of person she is, but don't rush it. If you value the friendship doing this right is important in the long run.

People say you can't be friends with exes but my ex is one of my best mates, we both have partners and hang out together regularly. Although this is dependant on a lot of factors and this isn't always possible.

If an employee comes to the office in a state that is obviously not fit for work, and then they collapse and end up hospitalised all because you heaped pressure on them to live up to your ridiculous standards, that's on you.

I’ve been through almost this same situation, actually... I told my SO that I would absolutely not raise our hypothetical future children in Islam (he’s Arabian and was raised Muslim).

It didn’t take long for him to realize he wasn’t even a believer anymore and we haven’t had any more issues (except damn does his family hate that our daughter isn’t being raised Muslim). 

It sounds like religion is important to your gf. And it’s important to you not to live a lie in a religion. I’m sorry, but it may end up being a dealbreaker for one or both of you. And that sucks, but it will eventually be okay, too. You both deserve to be happy and fulfilled in a relationship.

As far as I understand it now, they’re no longer in the group chat for others with DID and haven’t brought up the condition in a while.

What little else I understand comes from their Instagram profile, where they’ve mentioned having BPD, being on the autism spectrum (shortly being very into stim toys and regularly mentioning it but that has since died down), and chronic pain. 
I don’t ask much about their life, and people don’t often mention therapy in social media so your guess is as good as mine. My heart goes out to them for their struggles but yeah.

Relationships are build on trust. That foundation has been swept away. Some people can rebuild, others can't. Do what's best for you."
am3lck,"NTA.  

What you should do is talk to your friend, tell him in great detail what the relationship with her was like from your POV.  The point is NOT to get him to dump her (and make that clear).  Tell him you are concerned and you want him to understand what may happen with her.  Tell him you hope it doesn't and you hope him and her are happy together, but he should be careful.  
Then tell him in great detail exactly what things were like, what she said, what she did, and how it made you feel.  Be open about this, be a bit vulnerable.  Don't worry about being a man, if it made you feel like unloved sad shit with bad self-esteem then say so.  
Then finish up by saying you wish him and her the best and you want him to be happy and he can always talk to you anytime if he wants.  

The point of this- if she's doing the same shit to your friend, he probably feels much like you did at the start of your relationship- probably rationalizing her behavior and assuming it wasn't a large trend and that you should man up and not let her PMSing get you down or something like that.  
Problem is, that sort of thing wears you down over time, and it *hurts*.  
So for your friend to hear it from you will help him understand that 1. this is how the girl treats her SOs, and 2. it's not bad for him to feel shitty about it.  And it will also make him understand why you dumped her, which may validate his own desire to dump her possibly.  

Thing is, if you just come at him and say dump her she's shit, then it doesn't do any of that, it's just you trying to break them up.  So just be neutral and give him information, let him act on it when he's ready.  "

This is some petty, childish shit lol.

You knew what M was like, you had previously broken contact with her because you couldnt cope with her personality. Why the fuck would you think it acceptable to reinitiate friendship by ""testing"" her to see if she would be ok with you screwing around with the guy she likes? Who cares if she doesnt ""love"" him, she very well obviously liked him, you and T both knew that, and you intentionally messed with her emotions to see her reaction. Then you continued to test her when her friend bailed, effectively making her the third wheel because you two, who ""have feelings for each other"" BUT its purely sexual (I'm sure that will end well) couldnt keep to yourselves for a couple hours at HER house!

Dont get me wrong though, shes an asshole too. She agreed to go out with you both the following day, knowing very well she was upset about the idea of you two together. She seems to have made very little effort to control herself and her emotions while with you, likely becoming upset, bitter, angry as the day went on and then acting on impulse to try and drive a wedge between you and T. She could have just stayed home or went out with her other friends and had a much more enjoyable day.

 Its pretty obvious that you and T are not capable establishing a healthy relationship with M as none of you seem to know how to handle it appropriately. You, T, and M are all assholes."

You did like a zillion things wrong in that conversation.   Since you want a detailed list, I’m happy to oblige.

1) You whispered “citation needed”.   You *know* that was wrong.   I know that you know because you’re using the excuse that you choose to ignore 99.9% of the shit-talking.  Should have been 100%.  (This was a minor slip and understandable.  Totally forgivable.   But ... the fact you slipped up makes you the asshole *if* you can’t forgive your friend equally minor slips.)

2) Only John had a guild B tag.  You can’t blame her for the actions of the others.  You have no proof they are affiliated.

3) You call for proof that someone from Guild A whispered John.   But you already knew someone had, because it was you.   Then you admit it next sentence, so I don’t even know what you were trying to do.  It seems like you were just trying to gaslight her, which is asshole behaviour.

4) I think you just don’t understand what she’s trying to say when she said John hates you guys.   (Misunderstanding, rather than asshole behaviour.)   She’s just saying guild B didn’t turn him against you.   He already hated you.   The proof is that John left your guild.   He obviously had an issue or he wouldn’t have left.

5) It’s actually none of your business whether Guild B enforces their guild charter.  You don’t get to use that.

6) Kicking John.   Oh please.   Technically she didn’t say that you said to kick John.  She did imply it.   Same as you implied John should be kicked (you said you’d kick someone behaving that way in Guild A AND you quoted their charter, suggesting their own rules meant John should be kicked).   That’s gas-lighting again.

6) I can’t be sure you’re being hypocritical, because maybe Guild A’s values include gas-lighting and it being okay to respond to shit-calling if it was just a 1 in 1,000 (99.9%) slip up.   But I suspect you are.

7) “I don’t really care about the actions of Guild B”.   Really?   Could’ve fooled me.

8) No one except Paul has said anything to anyone in Guild B.   Paul ... and YOU right? Because you asked John for that citation and you’re certainly saying a lot right now.

9) You just repeated problems 3 & 4.   John obviously had an issue, that’s why he left.   You’re asking for proof of whispers that you KNOW you sent.   That is gaslighting.   It’s something abusers do to unbalance their victims.  You really, *really* need to stop doing it.

John sucks.   The people harassing Guild A suck.   You responding to John was a minor (and understandable) error.   But the way you just repeatedly lied and gaslit your friend means you are the asshole."

What you are requesting is, at its core, not unreasonable. You are in your late 40s and and will likely be working for another 10-15 years. You and your wife  aren’t the typical retired couple who can devote a lot of time to their family. This is reality, and it’s not wrong for you to want some time for yourself.

However, you are a huge fucking asshole for the way you handled this and the way you view your son. It’s so obvious that you resent your son for stealing your youth, and that you view him as a lifelong burden rather than a gift. You have a happy, successful, and loving son that wants you to be a part of his and his family’s life, do you know how lucky you are? You’re spitting in his face because you can’t get over the fact that he’s gonna have a better life than you. It’s your own fault you knocked up your high school sweetheart, not his. So stop taking it out on him. 

Fortunately, it sounds like you are a good dad otherwise and you did a great job raising your son. Why do you want to put all that hard work to waste pushing him away?

It isn't your place to comment or speak up for your mother, especially if your mom hasn't confided in you that she dislikes the arrangement.

Let's assume this is a problem for your mom and she can't keep up with the babysitting even after cutting it down to three days/week.

They are under no obligation to pay you early so that you can make your bills on time. That is your responsibility to budget that money so that you have it when it is needed. It would be nice of them if they decided to pay you early, but if there is an agreed upon time when you get paid, that is when you get paid. Many jobs do not give advances on paychecks. 

If you do not want to abide to the agreement, you are free to find better employment. Honestly I'm kind of surprised you haven't found a second job if you're only getting 4 hours a week with this family."
am67xr,"NAH, but please see a doctor about this. "
am6k5r,"NAH. Wanting to have sex in your relationship doesn't make you an asshole. This whole thing seems like bad commhnication, though. Why does sex make him anxious? What can you do to alleviate that? Is he willing to work through his anxieties? What is he currently doing to work past his anxieties, which are clearly impacting you and your relationship? When you do have sex, what's different that's helping him feel comfortable? If you haven't explored these questions, you haven't had a real discussion about this issue yet which could help you guys work on this."
am6kt9,"ESH. Your parents shouldn’t have made promises they couldn’t keep.  But you have no right to be angry. Disappointed, yes. But not angry.

They should just let him have it. 

You should call or write a letter or email explaining how important it is to him to still be involved despite his inability to play any more. Sometimes you just have to put the human touch on things (just don't get mad in your communication)."

am6wxu,"NTA. He's trying to make you responsible for his actions, and that's not fair. Wanting you to speak Italian more is fine, but it sounds like you're already accommodating that as much as you can. You're just not a native Italian speaker and he always knew that about you."

am6z82,"NTA - I had a very similar situation (roommate's gf would always be there) and my biggest regret was not talking to him about it now and letting it fester. If this truly bothers you, you have every right to be comfortable in your own home. And that includes having people there that you agreed to have there."
am72ao,"NTA because it's a small amount, but it's reeeeally annoying to be repaid in quarters.  You know that you use Venmo, you could have asked him if he has it too.

am73uw,"YTA. Friends dont lie to each other.

He didn't pay for it, so it's yours. There's nothing wrong with taking it back at all. He's a fucking asshole both for not paying you, even now with his better job AND spreading rumors about you even though you were nice to him when he was in a difficult place (I suppose he knows about you being homeless now?).

Think about it like this. If a white woman got along with your daughter, you would have never said that. You would've called her friendly, good with children, or fun to be around. Don't try to apologize. Just try to be more cognizant of this sort of casual racism down the line. Also deduct more points if you actually used the term 'person of color'."

am95nb,You wouldn’t be the asshole for having your fiancé deal with his daughter.  You didn’t ask and maybe I’ll be the AH for saying this but marrying a man twice your age when you’re not confident enough to tell a thirteen year old what’s what doesn’t seem like a good plan. There’s something very wrong with a 40 year old who goes after a teenager.  Good luck.

I hope one day the shoe is on the other foot so you understand what an asshole you were."
am9upn,"YTA, why on earth would you agree to be her maid of honor if you were going to drop the ball and only make half-assed attempts. There are bridesmaids dresses in every color all year round and just because it’s not a “traditional fall color” doesn’t mean you have to be judgmental. She shouldn’t have had to plan or inform you about a bridal shower, as MOH it’s literally one of your duties to throw the bridal shower.

And saying you couldn’t make her wedding because of a venue change is weak. There are cabs and Ubers if you need the car ride and literally can’t find anyone. As far as “I couldn’t miss class”, it’s literally your supposed best friend’s wedding. If you truly cared about her, you’d do what you had to to be there. It’s not her fault you fucked up in school and are on academic probation.

TBH, it just doesn’t sound like you were being supportive at all from the get go and should have declined being MOH so she could find someone who was actually happy for her to fill that roll. “I never thought she’d go through with it” is petty as hell, and I agree this one-sided friendship should end, but based on what you put here, it’s not one-sided in the way you think it is.

Your family is being nice to you because you’re family, YTA 100%."

Everyone deserves common human decency, and besides being clingy and needy, I don’t feel like A did anything to lose the right to be treated like a human. 

You weren’t obligated to continue the friendship, but to not be an asshole, you could’ve ended it in a way to give closure. "
ama7c8,"YTA - Asshole is a strong word here, but inconsiderate, surely.

I come from a religious background but I’ve never been a biased person. I understand where your friend is coming from by saying “If God wants me to move he’ll give me a way” but he is incorrect as to assume that it’s just going to be handed to him. In religion we are taught that we have to meet God half way with the work we put in. God isn’t just going to do everything for us. You’re totally right to say that if he wants something then he should work for it and get it, where religion comes in is in the situation where he was working for it but it just ended up not working out. Since he actually put the work towards it, but it didn’t work out, that would be an example of God stepping in and guiding him to the right path. But all in all if you want something you’re going to have to work for it, and for us religious folk, whether it works out or not is up to the big man up stairs. "

Sure, you overreacted and made a fool of yourself, but I don’t know that I would call you an asshole here. Maybe this is even a NAH situation. Just sounds messy and drunk.

And, if the driver was as bad as you said, I can’t blame you for your anxiety flaring up so badly. 

Maybe just apologize for the silent treatment you gave your boyfriend and move on?"
amb52n,"YTA. You know what your BF's reality is like, in terms of his romantic instincts or lack thereof, and you are willfully ignorong that because you want a fairytale whirlwind.

ambzuc,"NTA, you weren't rude and this wasnt something you could go do with your sister another night - whereas gaming with your bf is something you can easily reschedule.

If this was turned on it’s head how would you feel?  If your boyfriend was going on a trip away with their ex? Your relationship is still very young (a few months) so it’s a safe assumption to make that your boyfriend would feel uncomfortable with you going away with somebody that you dated previously.

YTA (again) for actively excluding your boyfriend from your activities.  Why don’t you want him to go?  Is he so socially inept that he can’t make friends with your friends?  Fair enough if he doesn’t show and interest but deliberately leaving him out *and* going on a trip with your ex (regardless of how many other friends are going) is a dick move and should appear to your current boyfriend as the massive red flag it is."

I don't think it's your *concern* that makes you an asshole - it's the way you expressed it.

See, think about it the other way around.  Let's say you have a decent job that you really need.  Someone at work is causing you trouble (admittedly, significant trouble), and your significant other (who is not present to see the interactions) is worried.

You tell them that you want them to stay out of it - *that you can handle this on your own.* Instead, they go over your head to your parents and demand that they force you to quit, or go over your head in yet another way to basically risk getting you in trouble at work.

You basically acted like she was a child who could not make her own decisions.  Yes, maybe there was a risk, and maybe she was not enjoying it.  But it wasn't your job to try and step in, especially when she told you not to. She's an adult, presumably, or at least adult enough to have a job, which means she gets to make her own decisions, even if the results are not great."

You are for not taking out the trash. I get that you were annoyed by the knocking but that was the point...you had ignored a responsibility *that you accepted* for almost a week. Trash in particular is a bad one, no one likes a smelly apartment and you were basically ignoring his repeated requests.

I want to be careful here, but you can't keep using ""depression"" as a shield against bad behavior. I'm not saying what you're experiencing is legitimate but sometimes you have to take care of your responsibilites or at least communicate with your roommate. Hiding in your room makes you seem evasive.

I gave it to both because this whole passive-aggressive note passing is not a good idea. Also him leaving the trash outside your door doesn't really help anyone. Each of your threatening to report the other is silly. Sit down and talk to each other, explain your feeling and apologize for going back on your word. "
amih70,"ESH. Telling on people talking shit is pointless. These types of workers end up burying themselves. It's best not to tell on others.

Let me tell you why. She is now probably going to assume you told on her and therefore she's going to talk to other people now other people will label you a narc. I mean this doesn't matter in an entry level job but in careers this is absolutely not a reputation you want.

The only reason to narc on someone in my opinion is if it's unlawful (timecard fraud) or seriously negatively affects other people (stealing, taking credit for major projects she didn't have a part in, etc. )

And you wanted to have a fun week with your kids, great. But that doesn't absolve you from your responsibilities as a parent and a husband and that includes cleaning up after yourself. 

Edit: one more thing, consider the example you're setting for your kids. You're showing them that they don't have to clean up after themselves because someone else will. "

amja4e,"NAH - From how you describe your relationship with your friend prior to your stay at the hospital, she probably didn't know the extent of what's going on with you. I'm sure you didn't want to burden her with what you're going through and she was probably overwhelmed when she suddenly heard about all the things you're struggling with.

You're not an asshole for wanting to have a normal friendship and you're not an asshole for finally wanting to tell her about what you're going through.

But I also don't think she's an asshole for cutting you off. She didn't do it in a very delicate way, but she might have felt like you were ""mean"" to her in the sense that she felt lied to about who you are. 

Not all friendships are strong enough to weather through mental illness. I have friends I'm close enough to who I can talk about mental health with. Other friends I know would feel burdened or overwhelmed. That's not the fault of either party."

~~Can you give some other examples? Because only this one does not seem like a big deal.~~ But I do understand that these kind of things can all add up and you might want to have a calm conversation with her about how you feel and how you want her to behave in those situations.

Not apologizing to your child just because you are the parent is quite a shitty behaviour though.

That being said, your husband is allowed to have his parents *STOP BY* the waiting room without being an asshole either, if they (and he) understand that under no circumstances will they be allowed in the delivery room and that he should be focused on you and not his parents... who should have left after a couple of minutes (per his assurance to you)."

Tinder isn’t a networking site, so if your boyfriend is using it that way, he should state it *clearly* in his profile.

And obviously it’s fair for you to be uncomfortable with him accepting dates from other girls. His bit about how it’s clearly platonic and if it’s not, well... hm I guess I’ll cross that bridge when I get there... is not respectful of you or your relationship. "

He got caught cheating and had a suicide attempt while you were there (and knowing you’d save him) thereby making you feel guilty and giving him victim status (plus the ability to say “it’s not the time” and get out of the conversation).

People who don't have feelings for your gf will do the exact same thing. Nothing has changed between you not knowing and now knowing. 

It's ok to be insecure, but YTA because you actively ""take it out on her"" by being ""cold and mean"" and ""man child sulk"". What do you hope to accomplish with this? Make her coddle your insecurity forever until...what? You understand her circumstances and yet put her between a rock and a hard place because you don't want to manage your own emotions. This is not a grown up partner behavior, it's child behavior to a mom. What did she do to deserve mistreatment? Trust you and be honest to you enough to let you know that some other guy has confessed feelings. This is going to teach her never to trust you to be adult about your own feelings, never to be honest about her social relationships with you, and that having a man child as a partner is exhausting because she WILL have more people in her life have feelings for her and she doesn't deserve to be punished by her bf for it. Choose carefully.

Remind her that you love her and think about her even when she doesn't expect it. It's hard on both of you but she's probably going out of her mind with bring responsible for them day and night with no breaks. 

Even if she has a job, she is still holding all the responsibility of them.

Just wait until the stars alined years later to spring a pre-teen on your parents? I truly don't understand. 

Then you are having a lot of issues and are stressed out because your kid was born premy, and needed to lean on your dad for support. He obviously flips out. Expresses his desire to raise his grandkid (which you gave him absolutely no chance to do) which is understandable. 

But then on the flip side, you are legitimately upset, not a complete asshole. And he is refusing to even see the kid because he can't get what he wants, or is taking it out on the kid, because he's pissed at you. 

Honestly you fucked up big time here in my opinion. But as a Dad I'd like to think I'd put my own shit aside and make sure my kid is ok. So ESH.

I apparently feel differently than the majority of comments here. We live in a strange time where misrepresentation is the new norm. But, it shouldn’t be okay on dating sites. I see nothing wrong with “hurting someone’s feelings” when they are so obviously making themselves look different than reality. It’s not fair to you as they’ve wasted your time. People need to know it’s because of misrepresentation. If you continue to baby people to avoid hurting their feelings over something that is clearly their fault, they will just continue to waste more people’s time. Fuck that! "

Unless there's something you're not sharing- and my understanding is just that the only wrong you did was talking with your friends about favoritism in the dance company? It sounds pretty odd for your friends to say ""You learned your lesson"" - what lesson is there to learn? That you shouldn't talk about things that upset you?

Office drama, school drama, political drama, whatever it is - justified or not - people are going to talk about things that upset them. In my current job, people talk badly about the boss sometimes, our processes and other stuff - and while someone could potentially ""go viral"" with something like that and try to get someone fired, no one has - not saying they should or shouldn't, just that this kind of thing happens a lot but in your case, you got ""shafted"" and how you were acting/what you did is not unusual.  Now in retrospect it obviously didn't benefit you to talk about this to your friends, but people also have a need to vent the emotional stress. It's also true that what you were pointing out is a legitimate injustice but in the game of ""telephone,"" the message got misconstrued. 

You may want to go to a therapist for this, because this sounds like it was really traumatic, and worse yet, everyone probably felt justified in how they acted too.

There is nothing wrong with moving on, no matter how long you knew your friends. It can be much easier to rebuild yourself and get a fresh start with new friends, where you can be confident in embracing the entirety of your personality. (For myself, I used to be really embarrassed about my sexuality/sexual desires and constantly paranoid about it, but after I graduated college and made new groups of friends, I realized that it hasn't caused me any stress in a long time because I simply embrace it with my new friends and I've become comfortable with it). Your old friends may be causing you to fall into old-feelings and old-versions of yourself which can be destructive to you. There is nothing wrong with moving on. The others probably didn't want to talk to you directly about what was going on because they feared confrontation, or worse, expected you to lie about it, or just didn't see the point because they already ""knew"" what was going on."

Your parents seem to have obvious boundary issues. Obviously you should have set some healthy boundaries, sooner, but in this case, they need to respect that it isn't *their* home, they don't get to act like it is, just because they like your dog.

I would honestly forbid any attempt at sneaking into *your* home, as it just reinforces that they get to act however they want and still get full access, whenever they want. Maybe even change your locks. This is not normal or healthy behavior and considering how they take issue with respecting your privacy (whether for work or otherwise), you probably shouldn't *want* them in your house when you aren't there."

amx9x0,"Some couples are compatible, and some aren't

Sometimes the incompatibility takes some time to reveal itself.

But once it does, I think a lot of people make the mistake of not acknowledging the incompatibility. 

I think it's worth acknowledging. 

You need someone who is understanding of your trauma. Your guy, you love each other and ostensibly he's trying, but maybe it's just not in his makeup to be able to. Maybe his own trauma poses an insurmountable obstacle to his being more understanding. 

But that's possibly not something he can change, or do any better than he is now.

Many times people don't like to acknowledge the answer for why they're incompatible with another person. Maybe you're thinking ""fuck it sucks that I'm not compatible with this person even though we love each other because of my trauma"". 

But it's not that simple. maybe each of you need someone who *didn't* experience trauma, who will understand you and take you as you are for each of your traumas in the way that you each need.

I don't see any other way for it to be possible to be vulnerable and open with another, in the way that a relationship requires, than to be with someone who is able to understand you the way you need to be understood. 

So no, I don't think you're the asshole. But I think you should start honestly assessing whether the two of you are compatible. "

I say this for good reason. You’re clearly worried about your mother, as is the rest of your family. Living obese is a sad way to live and is obviously directly causing her problems. Although, I do not think a “hard word” with her is the way to go about it. I’m sure she knows her weight and the repercussions of it. I’m sure she wants to one day see her grandkids and experience that joy with you. 
My mother is obese, and she is one of the most inspiring and loving people out there, she works her ass off as a nurse and is the main provider for our family, but she too suffers knee problems as well as back problems from a nasty fall that broke her back. I’ve talked to my mother, and lovingly told her that I want her around for a long time, and suggested we eat better. She cut out pop and dropped a few pounds, and she began losing even more from the healthy family meals we cook together. It’s the little changes and things in ones diet that really do the trick. Go along with her on this journey and make it a family thing — you don’t drink soda and you all eat the same healthy meals!

I have struggled with unhealthy family dynamics as well, I cut people off even though it was hard. I had to look out for my own well being, they certainly didn’t care about it.

NTA because it appears that your friend didn't take your considerations seriously. Infact, your friend should have seen their eagerness for you to drink more despite you saying no as a red flag.

INFO because I wonder if having them join a call was a way to get the air cleared in a non-party/non-drinking setting? Or was he being deliberately condescending about it? It could be possible that your friend is trying to stay in these guys' good graces.

an2oe9,"YTA. This is a simple “put yourself in their shoes” situation. 

It sounds like your friend struggles with a lot of anxiety in these situations and trusted you enough to be vulnerable with you about it. Instead you saw it as an opportunity to basically one-up/ flex on him for what? A girl? A testosterone-driven fix you needed to get?

Cute girls come and go, and I highly doubt she’s the love of your life. But you just showed someone you consider to be a friend that they will come second when the choice is between a random girl and them. You also just showed your friend that you have absolutely no concern for his struggles and he’ll most definitely think twice before confiding in you again about this type of thing. 

It’s upsetting because I can tell you’re young, and you don’t really grasp the situation outside of yourself or what you feel. You know you’re friend is upset and that’s upsetting, but you don’t get why or how that relates to you. I hope that as you age you’ll start to think about how others feel, or could feel, before you pull the trigger on petty things like this. "

It sounds like they’re hurt that you don’t see them as people to trust, but honestly I wouldn’t trust these girls either. If they don’t understand why you’re so reserved and just see you as one big lock that needs to be picked, they’ll never truly get who you are. These girls seem like they’re more into having everyone’s secrets than having genuine relationships, and when there’s someone in the group that doesn’t want to spill all of theirs, they are seen as a threat. You shared something personal and vulnerable with one of them and were shot down hard, now you don’t see them as these big open-armed people they are posing as, and I don’t blame you. 

The girl that showed you her arm is very obviously going through something that is making her fish for attention and comfort. I hope she gets what she needs, but what she needed in that situation is very different from what she wanted. What she needs is a professional to talk to and to sort out what she’s feeling and going through, what she wanted was to be chased by you and showered in love/pity. I don’t blame you for not wanting to play the part. 

If everyone there unanimously agrees that they give more than you do, I would put some thought into how you express your love and friendship to your peers. If you genuinely don’t care about these girls, that’s one thing. But if you do consider them your friends and they are calling you out on being flighty, I would acknowledge that and see if it’s something you want to work on in the future. If not, I get it. But it may be something you continue to run into in future relationships. When it’s all spelled out, I completely understand (and actually commend) your need for some fresh air and to clear your mind. But with no background, I’m sure it looked a lot like you up and leaving when a friend came to you with something difficult. 

All in all, I think you handled this in a very mature fashion, and I think you are living with a bunch of girls who haven’t really grown up. But, you also spilled a lot of background info out in this post. These girls don’t know the weight that self harm and suicide holds in your life, and the only way they would know is if you opened up. That is a choice for you to make.

an3chd,NTA. The assumption is when one tenant moves out the space will be cleaned and repaired prior to the new tenant moving in. Since this was not taken care of before you moved in you did the right thing submitting the ticket right away. It isn’t your fault that the room wasn’t up to par nor was it the landlord’s fault so neither of you should have the responsibility of doing the repairs or paying for them. The rental contract the previous tenant signed presumably had the expectations for the state of the room after moving out and if they didn’t live up to those expectations they don’t deserve the full deposit back.

You best friend that you live with asked you for a favor, to play at her wedding for free, because you're her friend and because she considers you a good musician, enough to have you perform to her family.

But it seems you're only against doing this because you were expecting to be in the wedding party but you're not. Nothing to do with the cost or effort of doing it, but because you're not getting what you want, so you're then not willing to give her want she wants out of spite.

anbplc,"ESH. Are you paying for rent and food? If not, you're coasting by on her generosity. You're not owed cooked meals just because she said she'd cook it for you. Yeah it would have been nice of her to share but taking food off her plate and running away is acting like a child, which I guess you are by the fact that you live as a dependent and act as if she needs to ""respect"" you by cooking for you AND not touching your food. "
anbuh5,"Torn between NAH and ESH. You definitely have a right to your privacy and a right to say no. However, if you guys are so open with seeing each other’s conversations, you refusing this one time is going to look suspicious to her. I think she’s a bit justified to be mad about that."
anbwoj,"NTA, you have established rules and told him not to do it. He chose to break the rules and did so more than three times. "
anc5i5,"NTA for sure. But I want to clarify one thing... Why is it you who must pay for their dinner!? If I invite my friend to go out somewhere it's not obligatory for me to pay for them. 

And I don't know what it worse - friend one who didn't even try to suggest another time and get mad because you invited another one OR friend two who complained about you haven't invited the first one?

For me it seems like toxic friendship according to info which you provided.

&#x200B;"
anc9ej,"NTA!!!!! You sound qualified, professional, mature, and experienced. He sounds like a greedy, lazy, chump who thought he could use you to make a quick buck. He deserves everything you can throw at him. You tried your hardest and have everything you had to help him succeed and he mooched off you, get his ass. "
ancdqo,"YTA. It was your choice to buy drinks, you cannot force someone to do something just because you did. You got salty and drank someone else's drink you orginally graciously bought... it is gross and a warning bell anyhow for those girls, you were too salty. If you were originally mates or you knew them, maybe it should work like that.. but they weren't."

anchq2,"NTA. She's your sister and she's underage. Sounds like they're both making bad decisions. And you aren't fucking up his life, he did that himself when he had sex with a child, and if he does get her pregnant it can be very dangerous to give birth when you haven't finished growing yet. Plus if he's into pot and shrooms at age 18, he's probably just going to end up in prison anyway, be glad you've got your sister out of that situation."

You're both dicks. 
"
and3w9,"NTA - I was a bit confused about how you got into this conversation, but putting that aside, your dad is the asshole. 

He would be an asshole even if your disorder directly related to the situation, for example, if he was ragging on you for getting distracted, you blamed it on your disorder, and he said something shitty about also getting distracted sometimes. That would be ignorant and mean, but at least it would make sense as coming from a place of feeling personally aggrieved by a particular circumstance.

But it sounds like he said those shitty things gratuitously, and with no real purpose or dog in the fight other than his desire to pick a fight with you as a theoretical matter. He showed himself to have zero empathy or desire to validate your difficulties, even though he is your dad. That's even worse, and he sucks."

I fully support your boyfriend in wanting to go on a holiday; I don’t think couples need to be together 24/7. But a month is a much longer time than a guy’s weekend. I think he should’ve atleast spoken to you before saying yes, even if he would’ve said yes no matter what you thought. A month is a pretty long time to go away from your partner.

Edited: With the info that it’s a trip with his father, I still think NTA. He should’ve told you beforehand but IMO you shouldn’t have a problem with him going for the holiday with his dad especially if he doesn’t do it often."

Girls give soft no’s because they’re worried it will seem rude or that the other person will get angry.

She finally gives you a hard no and you ... get angry.

andf72,"NAH you’re an adult and it’s your money. Keeping £500 for settling expenses is reasonable, but why be dishonest about it? Don’t you think your parents will realize that the amounts aren’t the same between what was in the old account and what went into theirs?"

andko5,"YTA. It's just two weeks, compared to four months. I really don't see how starting the trip off with your mom means that you won't be able to discover yourself once she's gone.

anduoh,"ESH.

You did have an important call and probably should have let them know it was a bad time for you, if you wouldn't be able to pay full attention to it, and you are interrupting it to put your kids to bed, that doesn't seem like a huge and very important concern.

While I do understand your sister's point of view (it certainly looks like you don't care about it, since you even hung up), her comment calling your wife lazy is out of line, even if she wasn't sick, she might be tired from something else, or with the other kid, or whatever."
andx0q,"ESH.  All your talk about having no input is BS - you had the ultimate input since you knew exactly what place they were going for when you gave the money.  So YTA for all that.

ane02k,"NTA. She was tricked by a website that tried to get her to donate money (which she fell for btw), and began believing in a lie. While the lie did improve her life, it's a lie none the less. All you did was reveal the truth. What she should take away from this is that she managed to improve her life *despite* the fake IQ test, not because of it. Everything she's done to this point won't change just because she learned she doesn't have an IQ of 140. All those achievements are still her own, brought about by her own hard work and dedication. That's what she should take away from this, and because of that, you're NTA"

She is not ""passionate about this kind of stuff."" She is someone who uses it as an excuse to be rude and condescending to others. She was just looking for confrontation."
aneikb,"YTA in this situation, though not a major one. Kinda low key jerk. You were dating your girlfriend while talking to a girl you had feelings for. Sure, you never cheated physically, but definitely emotionally. You led your girlfriend on, and let the relationship drag on unnecessarily. You wanted her time and energy. I’m sorry to hear about your mom, and hope everything is okay with her. "

aneyyh,"NAH. You have a lot on your plate. It's fine for her to ask for help, but it's ok for you and your husband to set boundaries and say no too. I think expecting her to set the boundaries is unrealistic. She really does need help. You're the one that has to tell her when you can't do something. If she doesn't handle a no gracefully, then she becomes an asshole, but you haven't given any indication that you've ever tried to say no."
anf8v4,NTA - You're an adult and your mom is disrespecting you by ignoring your multiple requests to be left alone in the morning. She may be having some sort of pre- empty nest crisis and is trying to prove to herself that you still need her but she's not doing it to help you.

I understand if they were badmouthing you(they weren't)...but you don't know these people. His gf you probably aren't close with, and his other two friends you admitted to not knowing at all. Why is it strange that they decided to speak to your friend privately rather then talk to you?

You have some weird hangups my man. I get this isn't high stakes at all, but being reserved about criticism (constructive criticism even) when dealing with someone you JUST MET should not be surprising.

anfr5i,NTA.  She told you her schedule but her schedule is never correct.  You don't need to entertain someone who can't make the time to message you back.
anfsou,"NTA 

You’re nice enough to host them both, and provide the weed. It’s your chill time with your mates. 

Their bickering is constantly killing the mood, so you’re well within your rights to tell them to leave it at the door. 

Just do it tactfully dude, because they’re both your mates, this needs a scalpel not a sledgehammer. 

It might even cause them to address their obvious conflict. "
anft91,"NTA

Didnt even need to read the story, just the title. Being loyal and being a bad person along with someone else are different things.

angkel,"NTA. You have made it clear the teacher takes copying VERY seriously. Had you been caught, you two would have been in serious shit. I've also got ten bucks that says your ""friend"" would have thrown you under the bus if it meant saving his own ass. I've got ANOTHER ten bucks that says your buddy would have made it a habit of asking/demanding your notes if you had let him copy off of you and he'd gotten away with it.

Letting someone copy your notes isn't helping, it's enabling. An AP class demands a certain rate of performance from the students, and it's clear your friend isn't up to snuff. He'll do well dropping that class and joining the regular one."

You need to be taken down a peg and it sounds like your family knows that, you just don't yet. "
angu90,"NTA. It's a pretty petty and small thing that he doesn't *have* to do, but does anyway. It's really not an imposition on him to stop, so the fact that he keeps doing it suggests to me he's doing it specifically to piss you off or put you on edge or get you upset prior to the argument and so that he can claim you're being emotional."

anh1tz,"NAH

You both sound like you have no idea how car purchasing is supposed to work, you aren't assholes just dumbasses.

You should get the title before you make any payments, if the car was missing parts or pieces you need that written up and included in a bill of sale which is only valid if it's notarized. 

You shouldn't be making any payments if you don't have the title, if you don't have the title you don't own the car. Period. Sounds like neither of you knew that though."

Ugh the level of entitlement is fucking insulting! He has no respect for others so you did the right thing kicking him out. You should also cut him out of your life, people like this never have a lot of positive things to offer you in life. "
anhdzk,"NTA. Surround yourself with good people. There were probably other red flags that your ""friend"" isn't "
anhqab,"I'm leaning towards ESH, you ask a guy to move into your place after only knowing him 5 or 6 months. How well can you know someone after only 5 or 6 months? Then you encourage him to get rid of his vehicle, and quit his job. Now he's essentially freeloading and guilting you into not kicking him out. Yeah I'm going with ESH. Get rid of this guy, he's freeloading and costing you money that could be spent on yourself, more importantly your kiddo, rent, groceries or whatever else, especially since you're unhappy. "

Yeah NTA, I'd say you're fine lol I've dealt with that shit before. If someone gets obsessed with you and gives you really bad vibes (as well as tries to separate you from your SO, which is abusive behaviour btw) you're not in the wrong in any capacity for cutting them off. Honestly you could've stopped talking to them *just* because your mental state didn't put you in a position to deal with their problems as well as yours and you still wouldn't really be the asshole."
ani0fm,"YTA in this case dude but it’s not a big deal at all. You know what your younger brother is going through, you should want all avenues of emotional support available to him. You’re 24 he is 16, time to grow up. Also is it possible that your dad is so supportive because somewhere along the line he realized that he made a mistake not being supportive of you? "
ani28c,"ESH, I guess.

Yeah, it's kind of shitty to make a point of inviting everyone in the family, including his twin sister, but specifically single him out.

But at the same time, he seems like an ass and might deserve it.

I might suggest inviting him, putting his assigned seat in the back, and allow the ushers to remove him if he gets too obnoxious. If you do it, do it as a favor to his sister and his mother, not so much as a favor for him."
ani5ff,"NAH.

>I don't get why he would want to propose in the middle of someone else's engagement - it's less exciting for them, causes more stress and planning for everyone, and is just a blatant attention grab. I feel like this is almost as bad as proposing at someone else's wedding.

You're ridiculous. You don't get to dictate when other people get engaged or married. It's incredibly pathetic that you have a fear of someone else getting engaged before you, as if that matters in any way. Are you also going to try to dictate when they can have children?"

anij2r,"NAH. You guys have broken up, so it's ok for you to start flirting with others. It's also ok for her to be someone upset about that because she's still upset about the break up.

anikwp,"I'm inclined to say NAH, however, she's your girlfriend and she went with you to a wings game. Be a good boyfriend and indulge her. Is this the hill you want to die on?  It'll save you headaches later. "
aninlq,"Wooooooooooah definitely NTA (based on your account), I try not to mean any offence when I say this but, both your mother and her ex are major assholes, your mother for not being remotely decent and standing up for her daughter and her ex for just being an all round cunt. You come across as though you’re very concerned about role in all of this, my advice is please try not to worry, none of this seems to be any of your fault.

Plus, I am glad you stood up for yourself when found sleeping with the dog, keep going. "
aniqul,NTA- that's a long ass wait. I understand why you left after 45 minutes of waiting and then being ignored

When I was dating and doing the online thing I'd always casually mention ""hey, I'm going to be walking funny when I see you. Don't worry, I'm not a 1970's blaxploitation pimp, I just have a limp."" just so they weren't surprised.

If the way you two communicate is by yelling at each other without resolving anything and then not speaking then you both suck. This reminds me of posts I normally see where the wife is trying to make the husband more accountable around the house. You should look into those posts to see how you two can compromise. 

I understand pointing out all the housework you have to do to keep up with your SO when faced with one or two things you've done. But clearly, your SO doesn't respond to that and is just going to end up with more fighting. You guys will just need to find another way to discuss these issues.  "

Having a kid is very stressful and chaotic. Their child isn't about you. Sure you're a godfather but getting upset he didn't text you as soon as his child was born is pretty selfish. And with the fact, the child may not be his the situation is even more chaotic. 

If being a godfather is important to you, you'd think you would extend the olive branch and try to be in the child's life. "

This woman is PREGNANT with YOUR child. She is tired and has all these crazy hormones going on. Go be there for your fiancé or leave her so she can find someone who will. She wants to be with her fiancé, she needs you now more than ever. Like seriously.

Your mother is an enabler and you should not allow your mother to speak to the mother of your child like that. Seriously. "
anm7j6,"NAH, but you should stop lying.

You should bring her to the doctor with you to help explain, because she clearly doesn't understand the extent of what you've been through. Then you should see a couple's therapist and talk about this as openly and honestly as possible, confirming that her womanhood has nothing to do with your ability to orgasm, and that you want her to enjoy herself as well. "
anmfij,NTA - celebrity death is nowhere NEAR comparable to a loved ones death. Maybe she hasn't experienced close loss before so that felt big to her? You seem to be adequately apologetic for your small lapse in judgement -- hers was a shot to the heart but she sounds very immature and probably doesn't recognize that.
anmgrs,"YTA not because of your concerns they are completely valid. You’re an asshole cause you brought it up during a MEETING where his peers and bosses were, probably completely embarrassing the poor dude. He didn’t choose to have these issues and you’re gonna (for lack of a better word) shame him infront of other people like that? There’s no reason you couldn’t have privately talked to your boss about it, or privately talked to John about it asking if he’s able to do this. You need to apologize to him and explain yourself in a better manner "

I think you have the right to be alone, but I also think you need to understand you're not the only person who felt that loss.  Your mother, aunt, and brother feel as much grief as you do.

You mom might have wanted you there more than you realize."

annnof,"NTA. If that’s what you’d wanted him to do for you if you were in a similar situation, then I would say you’re not the asshole. I don’t really think he’s the asshole either.

anqbeb,"NTA. However, you'd be unwise to let her try to fix it, because it was her lack of knowledge of hair color reactions on bleached hair that caused the mistake in the first place. You're dealing with someone who messed up because she didn't know the basics of dying bleached hair. 

Previously bleached hair will ""grab"" onto certain hues in the hair dye more than others. You have to adjust the color used by a lot. Red is the color this kind of porous hair will really grab and keep. 

The solution would be to bleach it all out, then try again, but making sure the color used would look a lot more brown than red. Meaning, the dye chosen wouldn't resemble what you are really trying to achieve. 

OR

Dye over it, but accept it will be a darker brown, not light brown.

OR 

Wait, because red hair color is infamous for washing out and fading in a few weeks. It still won't be light brown. 

I wouldn't trust the woman to do my hair again. I would demand someone else at the salon to fix it. Yes, you are entitled to your money back or for them to fix it, but this stylist isn't very knowledgeable about hair dying..."

I'm going through a similar issue, but the person has to have motivation themselves and can't blame others for their lack of it. That being said, maybe start cooking healthy meals for both of you, see how long that lasts, and repetition of ""Let's go to the Gym"" and following through with that.   


If someone isn't motivated and unwilling to do something or break their habits its on them and not you. Personally I would give it about a month and if they don't go with you to the gym for a month or try to eat healthier then you've done literally all you can. "

I also felt that I'd never make her take a name she wasn't comfortable using for the rest of her life. I told her that if she didn't mind, I'd like to use Hart. I felt it still had connection to my original name while also being a name I can share with my wife and future child. I feel it's the right way to start our life together both sacrificing a bit of our old life to make our own family and unit.

I don't share the same view as you but that's not to say that I don't feel a connection to my history and family because I do, but maybe I don't place the same value in changing and adapting a name.

If you can’t have a conversation with them at all without them making it about Kpop, it’s reasonable to feel a bit tired of that after a while. That being said, you should probably specifically ask them to change the topic instead of just vague hinting that you’re less interested in Kpop than before. "

You’re playing up the sexuality of kids if you won’t allow your son to stay at your house if your daughter has a friend sleepover. Additionally, you’re teaching your daughter all the wrong things. Just because your daughters friend came out as lesbian, should not change a thing. Chances are, this girl has known she was lesbian for a long time. That should not impact your daughter/ the way she spends time with her. You are doing your daughter an incredible disservice raising her this way. 

While maybe having a coming out party for a 12 year old is not something you agree with or would do, it should not change the way you let your daughter see one of her best friends. 

You say, why on earth would you celebrate a 12 year olds sexuality. Correct - so what do you think you’re highlighting when you don’t let your son stay at your house when girls are staying over or you don’t let your daughter sleep at her best friends house. You are putting way too much emphasis on the sexuality of children.  

Edit:
More and more kids are going to be comfortable coming out earlier because thankfully society is becoming a safer environment for them to discover themselves and do so. Parents are going to have teach their kids how to interact safely with all genders, regardless of the setting. The same boundaries you should teach your daughter regarding a boy, should be taught for a girl and vice versa. Gender should mean less and personal boundaries should mean more. "

She might outright say ""just put me in a comfy position in front of the TV with some water and food and I'll be good."" She might say get someone else. You can try to get your sister to help out, or alternatively you can call up the hospital and see if there is anyone they recommend to help your mom out for the duration of your trip.

You're only the asshole here if you go against what she says, or if you go on the trip outright without discussing arrangements with her."

Your parents are allowed to have opinions on the people in your life. They should support you, but they should also tell you when they feel you're making a bad decision. The fact that you hung up on them when they gave you their opinion was childish, and I'd expect a 26 year old to act more maturely.

>AITA for feeling like she “owed” me? (That’s not the right word, but like, feeling like she should have reciprocated?)

I think we understand what you're getting at - a healthy relationship of any kind is about give and take. One person can't universally demand support and never return it, because that's an unequal relationship. That can persist for a short time period, but not forever, because the person getting no support is eventually going to get burned out, just as you did. 

And that's not even mentioning how utterly shitty it was of her to say this:

>“K, you know I love you but I’ve got my own shit going on, and I haven’t got time to listen to your petty stuff.”

She sucks."

Even if it's not technically allowed, could you still do it anyway if there's no employee there to reprimand you?

Now, you were on drugs and weird shit happens on drugs, so you’re not the biggest asshole. Still a small asshole for flirting so much with him, while she’d been hurt by him. Again, she needs to move on, but you could try to understand why this is so important to her that she can’t let it go? Maybe it’ll help you see it from her side.

Trying to give her a curfew is probably the reason she isn't being respectful now, I'd be pretty pissed if my roommate tried to pull that on me. As far as the RA goes, not snitching is probably the best thing to do if you want to continue being friendly with her. Maybe approach it in a less confrontational or angry way? I'm not sure, my roommate and I worked through things pretty easily just by talking about it one night, and we were both calm. "
ao1mul,"NAH (except for the abuser)

I want to start of by saying I’m incredibly sorry that this situation is happening, and although the damage has been done, I hope your family is able to take steps forward and learn to heal once this is all done and over with.

I don’t think there are any assholes here other than the piece of shit that abused your sister. I think you are upset that the focus isn’t being put on your sister, rightfully so. This should be about her as she was the one abused here, and your mother should come to terms with that. 

At the same time, your mother just learned that a man she loved for almost a decade was sexually abusing her young daughter. That is incredibly devastating as is, and to have to see that man repeatedly in order for the trial to be carried out must be very difficult on both her and your little sister. 

Now, if she is voicing her distress in hopes of inhibiting the trial, she is an asshole. But it sounds to me like she is just venting, and I think anybody in her or your sisters shoes would need to do that. "

Yes, they have saved up more up to now, but if you're a couple going in and buying a house together, you should be doing things as a team and not just saying ""Oh, I hit my share, I don't need to do anything more."" especially if one has more means than the other. Relationships aren't always 50/50, even if everyone is giving their 100%.

Besides, if you can't save enough on your own and end up being tight from unexpected costs, that effects both of you.  If you two have money left over, then it's not like they've lost that money- they still have it and can do what they want with it. There's just no reason for them not to save."

ao352j,"NAH. Like you said, she probably doesn't realize it's passive aggressive.

ao37t5,"NTA. You aren't obligated to put yourself in uncomfortable situations or suffer verbal abuse (because that's what it is when you're not both in on the joke) from someone just because you've sunk time into getting to know them. You're also not the one who told him you were avoiding him.

&#x200B;

If you want to give it a shot because of your history as pseudo-friends, talk to him and tell him about the behaviors that are bothering you. I did this with a friend years ago when I didn't like the way he was treating me and he shaped up. We're still close to this day."
ao380n,"NTA, but I would be careful with how you convey your doubts to her. Maybe suggest that she shadow someone on the job for a couple of days to get a better picture of what the day to day is like. 

Also, ask her to research average salaries vs the time/cost of whatever training she would need to work in your area. Additionally, see if there’s any data on job openings. If there’s a school nearby churning out recent grads, the job market will likely be pretty competitive. "

ao6k5r,"ESH. she's not over you and she's totally hoping she can swing this back into a relationship. you're not interested in that, but you're giving her false hope. it's gonna be drama- if you're done, be done. "

ao6pkn,"YTA. This whole post just feels like you want people to tell you it's okay for you to be a racist because you've had a hard life. Most people with mental health issues and dyslexia and roommates they don't like don't turn out to be nazis. See if you can find and learn from some of those people, instead of Jordan Peterson."
ao6qhp,"NTA, and you're right to call him emotionally manipulative. ""You need to change your attitude if you want to be happy"" = you need to accept that you'll be paying for everything."
ao6rg8,"NAH (except for facetime creeper), but y'all are clearly both victims of some cultural bullshit. This part: 

>Also it makes me feel like she doesn’t respect our relationship enough to make it clear to others there are boundaries.

is so close, but so far from the point. You might not be wrong, here, but the much bigger issue is that she doesn't respect *herself* enough to enforce her boundaries. This is gonna sound extreme, but seriously, women end up in dangerous and even deadly situations when they're too afraid of seeming rude to tell somebody to fuck off. If she's putting up with this behavior online, what aggressive behavior might she let slide in person because she feels like she's hit her quota of acceptable rejections?

I don't blame you for feeling weird about this, but you're going about it the wrong way. This isn't about you, it's about her. Don't ask her why she doesn't respect your relationship, ask her why she feels like she needs to take this kind of shit from people. "
ao6ts9,NTA You're not obligated and you handled it in a plenty polite way
ao6ur8,"YTA because at the time of the argument, you thought it had gotten lost because of a mistake you made on the address. If you made the mistake that led to it getting lost, you would eat the cost for it and not your friend. Glad it worked itself out though!"
ao6wx6,"NTA.

Don't depend on people like this.  You will save your sanity in the long run.

On a side note, are you now free for D&D sessions?"
ao6zs2,ESH if I were in this situation I would do whatever I could to go to the dance with her just because it means so much but I kinda understand your position too. 
ao7996,YTA.  Your friends are horrible to suggest you poison her.  You're suggesting she risk poisoning herself and spending time in gastric distress because you're skeptical.  Food intolerance can develop with age.
ao7h3z,"ESH.  Your boyfriend doesn't seem to understand women's anatomy and you're doing yourself a disservice by teaching him that what he's doing is working.  What he's doing isn't working and you're depriving yourself of a good time by validating his behavior.  If he treats you poorly because you haven't reached orgasm, he doesn't respect you or your pleasure."
ao7ico,"NTA.  It's ridiculous that you're not allowed to have your daughter for extended periods of time.  You're a father, not a babysitter.  Being an overprotective mama bear is going to do more harm than good for your daughter with her independence and other relationships."

ao7ysr,"YTA so I'm in the opposite situation I'm the higher earner while my SO could earn more if she moved to management or went independent. I could and used to work more but enforcing a work life balance is way more important than the extra money.

Also as an aside when you keep bringing it up and talking about how much more they can be making I'll bet dollars to donuts your SO has thought more than once you view them as an ATM. Now I'm sure that's not the case but that resentment can easily spread. You bringing up your limited earning potential hurts your case as well. It's not your SO's fault you currently have a limited earning potential."
ao80hq,"YTA. Support your mother in her time of grief. 

When my grandfather died I didn’t cry for him - he lived to be 90 and lived a happy life. I cried for my mom who was heartbroken. She needed loved ones to get through it. Your family probably does too. "
ao83c9,ESH and it sounds like you both need a break from each other.
ao83v4,"YTA, it’s her mother in major recovery vs a birthday party. It’s not about physically helping her, your wife wants to be there for her emotionally too.

ao8fjz,"NTA. Things can get super messy when you work or do business with family and don't treat them as you would any other coworker/colleague/client. If a coworker isn't pulling their weight and it's negatively impacting you, you should speak to your supervisor so that they can try to resolve the issue. If you're concerned your doing so will get back to your SIL and cause family drama, maybe there's a coworker who would be willing to lodge the complaint.

But at the end of the day, if she can't do the job she was hired for, she and her managers should talk about making workplace accommodations and/or changes to her job role so she can perform the duties expected of her. If they're aware of the situation, it's quite unfair of them to expect the other employees to pick up her slack."
ao8gnx,"Yeah, NTA. If this India trip really was a once in a lifetime thing that couldn't be any other week I'd maybe get it, but even then he still should have talked to you the second he realized the dates were the same. "
ao8nhb,"ESH

You shouldn't make threats or give ultimatums like that, it's just going to make her more obstinate and desire you even less.

If she's not physically attracted to you any more, she should acknowledge it and either see if it can be fixed or move on and let you off the hook.

My personal guess is she either has a medical condition that's affecting her sex drive or she's no longer attracted to you or in love with you for some reason or another.

Urge her to see a doctor or go to counseling and explain to her that while you love her, you can't continue to live like this.  If she loves you and wants to fix the relationship, she'll be looking for answers as well.  But try to put in terms of wanting to improve the relationship rather than ""If you don't fix this I'm outta here!""

It sounds like you've been open about your concerns, although I don't know how you chose to phrase your ""discussions"".  If they were anything like ""I'll go get laid somewhere else if you don't put out, you should count yourself lucky you're still in the house.

There's no easy answer and I know this post is all over the place, but I do wish you luck."
ao8of9,"NTA, I can see how *some* of these things would annoy someone, but she's an asshole for not communicating that with you. "
ao8q6e,"NTA

Go visit r/JustNoMIL for some specific pointers.

Edited to add a personal, somewhat related story.  I was on maternity leave with my oldest and my mom over was visiting.  I see my IL's car roll up out front.  My husband was at work and no one told me they were coming over.  My MIL hops out with a fucking shovel and then grabs a flat of flowers out of the back of her SUV.  She spent the next thirty minutes planting flowers I did not ask for or want in my landscaping by the front door.  

I texted my husband asking what in the world his mother was doing.  He had no clue she was coming over and he called her that night to chew her out.  In a passive aggressive move, I never touched those flowers.  I didn't water them but I also didn't waste my time or breath to rip them out.  They wilted in the Texas sun pretty quickly.  Don't mess with my yard, lady!"
ao8qnc,"ESH, the old man is a douche for not getting in the back of the line, but your son got waay too up in arms over being 1 spot back in line. By everyone sucks I mean everyone sucks but you, you did the right thing by de-escalating. "
ao8riq,"NTA. if you wear one, he should wear one too. What reason would he have not to? If you believe that marriage is antiquated, surely having only the woman wear a ring is along those same lines? It’s a bit cringey, like he wants to mark you as his or
something. Which would be kinda cute if it went both ways, but it doesn’t. It’s a small ring, not a giant piece of costume jewelry. It’s not asking much of him. "
ao8u3i,"NTA for not WANTING her to hang out with this dude. That feeling is only natural, esp. given how you two came together. 

However, you WILL be the asshole if you try to demand that she not see him. All you can do is express that you're not very comfortable with the arrangement, articulate your reasons why, and leave the decision to her. The way she handles it will tell you everything you need to know about how she values you vs. how she values him. "
ao8zac,NTA I would let him know that you appreciate what he does but not getting gifts on holidays or late birthday gifts make you feel like an afterthought. It's not the gift but the thought that counts. 
ao90ak,"ESH, your boyfriend sucks for not knowing you well enough. You on the other hand could have waited it out and mention it to him after the dinner was over. Now you made a fool of him in front of everyone"
ao90l3,"NTA- also, why do you still want this person in your life? She is pressuring you for sex and threatening to cut off your friendship without it? That's terrible! I say, let her, and good riddance!"
ao98hu,NTA  sorry but she was in effect harrasing the one coworker  and you.  
ao9a21,"NTA. But your ""friend"" who keeps hitting on you knowing you're taken is a huge fucking asshole. And then he has the nerve to criticize you for telling your boyfriend ? He's a selfish narcissist. With friends like that, who needs enemies?"
ao9br2,"NTA. I think that’s a completely fair compromise. I would talk to your girlfriend about it a few more times just to make sure she’s 100% on board. You wouldn’t want her to resent you. And it’s YOUR wedding, so it’s YOUR decision. I understand that family should present for such an occasion, but if your future brother in law cannot behave himself then out he goes. And if your mother in law can’t handle that, give her the boot as well.

Can your girlfriend talk to him about this? About how he should behave?"
ao9j0g,"YTA for trying to drag her little sister into it. 
I don't understand the secretiveness since it's normal to have a boyfriend or girlfriend in high school. If you are already sneaking around and you are about to move, just end it. It sounds like she's not as committed as you are.
The whole situation sucks, but thankfully you are young and there will be other girls."

I will say this - don't close yourself off to the next 5 just because the first 3 had their issues. They might not all be that way, and you could be missing out on some wonderful support down the line. That said, you don't have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm. I don't see why this has to be ""adopt them or ignore them;"" seems like you could at least be open to conversation and handle it from there. "
ao9uui,"YTA because you're trying to have your cake and eat it too. You obviously can't have both of these women in your life, so if EITHER of them is important to you, choose one and cut the poor other girl loose.

aoadwq,"I'm gonna differ from the popular opinion here and say NTA. But do any of y'all actually know this song? It's weirdly upbeat, but the lyrics are very very intelligible and are definitely weird in the context of dancing with the dead ex's dad after her getting married to another dude. It's one thing to miss your ex, but I wouldn't want this sentiment being publicly proclaimed by my wife at my wedding if I were in the OP's shoes.

Vanilla Twilight - Owl City ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdc3RdXoFwA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdc3RdXoFwA)):

The stars lean down to kiss you / **And I lie awake and miss you** / Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere  
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly / **But I'll miss your arms around me**  
I'd send a postcard to you, dear / **'Cause I wish you were here** 

I'll watch the night turn light blue / **But it's not the same without you** / Because **it takes two** to whisper quietly  
The silence isn't so bad / 'Til I look at my hands and **feel sad**  
**'Cause the spaces between my fingers / Are right where yours fit perfectly** 

I'll find repose in new ways / Though I haven't slept in two days  'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone  
But drenched in vanilla twilight / I'll sit on the front porch all night  
**Waist deep in thought because when / I think of you I don't feel so alone** 

**I don't feel so alone / I don't feel so alone**

**As many times as I blink / I'll think of you tonight / I'll think of you tonight**

When violet eyes get brighter / And heavy wings grow lighter / I'll taste the sky and feel alive again  
And I'll forget the world that I knew / But **I swear I won't forget you**  
Oh if my voice could reach back through the past  
**I'd whisper in your ear, ""Oh darling I wish you were here""** "

In the future you could try to be friends with him again (if you forgive him), but honestly it's up to you.

But you’re not an asshole, you’re a parent who cares. You’re just in the wrong. Alienating your son from your other children and yourselves isn’t going to help his food problems. If he’s getting all the food he needs at home (and it sounds like he definitely is) there is probably a problem here that has nothing to do with satiating hunger - satiating another desire. (Loneliness, boredom, etc.) a kid that’s willing to spend his only access to cash on extraneous food sounds like a big red flag to me. What are his hobbies? Are they all free? How is he spending his time other than going out to eat? 

It might sound strange, but I would see a therapist to address these food cravings. your child is both reaching the age where his actions have long term consequences for him and his body, and still young enough to not have any idea of those ramifications. But he needs to want to make these changes for himself, you can’t force him to have a good relationship with food. Unfortunately, if this isn’t addressed, he’ll soon be off to college (hopefully!!) where most students have an abundant access to food of all sorts. He needs to learn how to make good decisions for him and his body, not just be forced to make them by his parents. "

She's a wanker for stealing food, but you've already spoken to her, which should have sorted it (if it doesn't, escalate). Gobbing off about her behind her back after you've spoken to her is cowardly and unlikely to work unless you're trying to push her into a corner. The whole office doesn't need to know this, keep your dirty laundry to yourself.

aoggsz,"NAH. you’re not the asshole for wanting more sex, but she’s also not the asshole for having a dwindling libido. There might be some underlying issues there (depression? Self esteem? Boredom?) but I don’t see any reason that they can’t be overcome. It sounds like she might be making excuses for not wanting sex when really it could be something deeper (you not being “sweet” enough is a little fishy...) A calm and honest heart to heart between you two (one where she doesn’t feel like she’s being attacked for her lack of interest in sex) could do wonders to jump start your dead bedroom. 

Sex in monogamous long term relationships is so stinkin complicated- the frequency can ebb and flow like the tide for a myriad of reasons ... but it doesn’t have mean she doesn’t love you or that you can’t get back to a better situation.  "

Once done if there are any stains I forget the exact “recipe” but 2 cups of hydrogen peroxide, a couple of tablespoons of baking soda and a drop or two of Dawn, mix and use immediately. Vacuum or sweep any dried baking soda when dry. 

If it all goes well, instead of a mattress, have her get a nice mattress topper, they are life changing, AND a NICE waterproof mattress pad.

It is *massively* not okay what your mother's parents did. I can completely understand where you father is coming from with them. I also understand where your mother is coming from, being as they're her parents. The issue with the sister seems to fall into the same area as the parents. She's great for helping, but after he fucked up (I'm assuming he *was* uncharitable toward the people trying to steal from him), he did try to patch things up and *she didn't let him*. That's going to be hard on some people, knowing that no matter what you do they will still hate you and go out of their way to make you uncomfortable/unhappy.

Now, the weird part is I didn't see how your mother's brother plays into this at all. Is the sister going to be there at the same time? If so, why can't they schedule a separate vacation? That's definitely not on your father, especially if your Aunt is insisting on coming at the same time since I'm sure she knows how your father feels.

Maybe there's just not enough info, but it feels to me like you're disregarding your father's feelings. It also feels like your father should try to schedule a time when your Aunt isn't there to visit your Uncle, or invite him over as he hasn't done anything, and it would make your mom happy. Your mother is going through so much, so she's probably just trying to keep the peace, but I hope you all can find a solution.

However, eating is one of the simple joys of life, and like you, I don't appreciate people spewing their moral vomit all over my pepperoni pizza.

I don't know if it may help, but whenever my friend would start her rhetoric when we were out, I joined in and amplified the horror effect. ""Omg this pepperoni is DE-LI-CIOUS! Well worth all the innocent pigs slaughtered brutally for me to consume it. I wonder, is there special pepperoni made from tiny piglets? That would be even purer to consume, imagine?"" and things like that. It was horrible for a few weeks, but then she got the point and realized I am not moved by her guilt trip."

Hey dude, as a fellow Chinese Australian dude as well as a guitar player myself I totally understand 100 percent of what you are going through. In the end It really boils down to tradition and in our culture little children are always spoiled like that. I'm not saying it's right, (it's fucked up) it's just how things are and somehow we have to come to terms with that. 

Your mum was right to yell at you afterwards (she definitely overreacted though) because you were also overreacting and being an ass by making things awkward for everybody. I understand that you really value your belongs, nothing wrong with that, but you really have to just suck it up because believe me, things won't change no matter how old you get. By constantly whining about everything your cousin did, you seemed like an ungenerous little brat in ur relatives eyes.

Your uncle and mum were also assholes though because they are teaching your baby cousin bad life lessons by spoiling the crap out of him. It is not his fault it's just how babies behave. Your uncle being rich and giving you free stuff does not excuse for him setting a bad example for his kid.

In the future I would recommend hiding valuable things in your bedroom before visits and work out a deal with your mum where you tell her which items you care less about and can be given away. "
aosxbo,"NTA 

He needs to respect your boundaries. No means no. 

That being said, I think it would be best if you two sat down and had a serious discussion about this. You can’t just leave decision making up to random gropes and spontaneous urges. He needs to know how you feel, and you two need to have a constructive conversation about it instead of letting this persist. "

aouri6,"NAH- speaking as a guy in the same position as your husband, you're not an asshole. And neither is he. 

It really is just....draining, both emotionally and physically to be among people. When my wife and I had this fight I explained it like this: we all have a ""social battery,"" but mine, and apparently your husband's take a little longer to charge and they really don't last as long. 

You aren't an asshole for wanting him around to share what you consider a good time. And he's not an asshole for not wanting to be uncomfortable. My wife and I ended up compromising, she took the pressure of the situation off. I wasn't required to go, and we made a signal that I could give to let her know I was overwhelmed and needed to go. It got to the point that heading to her family gatherings wasn't as much of a chore. I still don't make it to all of them. But I make it to a lot more of them then I did. It's just easier when you have a little more control. It takes time and honesty.

This guy is clearly a dick.

But planning in advance to get over-the-top mad at someone makes you an asshole too. Stand up for yourself without losing your shit.

Some other options:
- plan to be out of the house when he’s there
- talk to your roommate and agree to ban this guy from the house
- put the quilt away and remove any other potential sources of conflict while he’s there; agree with your roommate that messes caused by her friends are her responsibility to clean up "
aovt05,"NTA. His mom should have been bumped down the line as soon as he found out he was going to be a father. 15% of income is a lot when you’re trying to save for a house, having a baby and running a two income household with one vehicle. Inevitably, there will be unforeseen expenses like car repairs, dr visits, etc. There should be savings. Your MIL is not your husband’s responsibility in any way, shape or form unless it’s an emergency. I can appreciate the sentiment of wanting to care for his mother, but doing so in the situation you’ve described is only enabling her, not helping. "
aovylr,"NAH, if it’s a scheduling reason and not a “you’re better than her” reason then I don’t see why she might be upset, since she couldn’t do the job anyways, but I would certainly talk to her about it first and make it clear that she’s cool with it before you take it."

aowch0,"NTA. Yes, you went over there, but there's no way it wasn't super obvious you were trashed. It's also anyone's guess whether you drunkenly propositioned her or if it was totally her idea and you were too far gone to say no. Either way, that screams ""taking advantage"" to me. Plus, trying to make a joke about it tells me she doesn't think she did anything all that wrong. Forget her and find people that respect you more than that."
aowdf1,"NAH. She's free to be a sex worker and you're free to remove her from your dating pool because of it. There are lots of jobs that would be a dealbreaker for me... anti-abortion lobbyist, oil company executive, aspiring DJ. As long as you aren't shitting on her for her choices, she (and others) should respect yours. "
aowftr,"You're correct that she's not entitled to any of your tax return. But being right isn't the same thing as not being an asshole.

It's frankly pretty troubling that you're planning on getting married to a person when you can't even resolve a dispute over a (relatively) small amount of money. It's troubling that she would ask, and it's equally troubling that you would dig in your heels and say no. You're about to merge your lives and finances. Maybe it;s time to take a step back and re-assess what everyone's goals and motivations are. ESH."

aowm2s,"NTA, but as a way to improve things, perhaps, you could count up the transactions, and give her a ""bill"" to pay at the end of each week, so she only has to do 1 transaction a week,( or even every 2 weeks) instead of lots of little ones making her more likely to pay you, sooner.

Jokes aside, probably NTA depending on how you handled bringing it up. I understand how he'd be frustrated with people not reciprocating his idea of team spirit, but if others are uncomfortable with it, he should have just stepped down.

Having a baby, even one that's fussing, doesn't entitle you to dismiss everyone when they're asking you to move your vehicle. It would have been proper to ask why you needed to move so that you could get clarification before this turned ugly.

aox9y7,"YTA.

Your family wasn't being rude, so why are you embarrassed of them? Because they're not fancy sophisticates? 

What a dick thing to say. If your girlfriend loves you then she's not going to judge you for where you came from, so you're doing her a disservice by assuming otherwise. And your family doesn't deserve that kind of treatment just for talking about TV and movies, things that just about everyone in the known world are known to talk about during casual get togethers.

You owe your family an apology. You dick."
aoxeur,"NTA, yes its an asshole move but he deserves it."
aoxf1b,"I'm going to say ESH.

Your girlfriend seems very insecure about that scar but it's not an excuse to freeze people out for inquiring politely about it.

aoxzkz,"NAH. You’re being a little inconsiderate but not intentionally. It seems like there was a miscommunication—you thought you were getting alone time and she wanted you to come hang out with her and her dad. Obviously it’s pretty important to her that you spend some time with her dad (which is reasonable), so you should make the sacrifice and spend time with them. 

That being said, talk to her tomorrow about wanting some alone time. Wanting some you time is totally understandable, and you’re not TA for wanting you time. However, since her dad is in town, it would make more sense to have your you time next weekend. "

aoyaq1,"YTA, Ehhhh. I'm gonna be the dissenting opinion yet again and say YTA. 

From my/his point of view. I'm starting a newish relationship with someone. Now this someone has an ex that they talk to on a regular basis. That's not exactly usual but okay I'll let it slide. They're good friends. I mean they dated for 7 years. That's a very very long time. So I'm a little uncomfortable but I'm trying to be as upbeat about this as possible.

Then whenever I meet this ex they for some reason keep bringing up the past and experiences shared with my significant other while they were dating. Now this is super uncomfortable. In fact I think this is the plot line of most bad rom coms where the ex comes back and is clearly making me uncomfortable. It's weird. It's friggen odd. 

So finally point blank because I'm trying to reconcile that my partner and their ex are really good friends. I just ask the ex to not bring up the past because me and my significant other are trying to start our relationship and it's making me uncomfortable thinking about my significant other and their ex being close in a way I've not yet known. 

NOW instead of the ex understanding and realizing how uncomfortable it makes me, and instead of honoring my one request. The ex instead decides to be self rightous and starts talking about how I'm being disrespectful and trying to erase 7 years of experiences, and how they won't be quite for my sake. Hypothetical situation over.

Can you really blame them for backing off and deciding to not invite you to their party? I wouldn't invite you either.

Edit: I am no longer the unpopular opinion. This is new to me for this sub. "
aoybcw,"NAH. When dealing with any kind of addiction, or something that can lead down that road, a major part of recovery, and maintenance of that recovery, is changing your environment/social circles, changing your patterns and routines. You've made that change, have bettered yourself. I've known my fair share of addicts. The ones that made it, kept on the straight and narrow, were the ones that cut ties. The others that, once sorted, returned to old friends, all ended up back where they started. 

Now I know you don't mean addiction so to speak, but the same holds true with other negative lifestyles. Don't put yourself back in the position of being dragged back in. "
aoyfl6,"YTA, but only because you're living in her home,  presumably with her taking care of you.  You could be on the street.
 
Forgive her her sins and continue to live your life happily in the open. Hang out with your dad.  Talk about guys you like or have dated. Refuse to accept her BS, but don't snap at your mother.  Ignore her bad behavior and disengage, but don't be mean to her.
 
If she came into your home and tried the judgemental crap you'd be fully justified in walking her out the door. "

aoygm8,"NTA. If they're going to be loud and hog the TVs, it just makes sense that they go to the single guy's place. "
aoyto1,"YTA

If you know she's cheated, that's fine. But being with her going out with friends then getting mad afterwards isn't fair.   Talk with her and have an adult conversation.  Admit that you were jealous when you saw the video, and worried that it appeared it was only her and the two guys at the house rather than a larger group.  You're comfortable with the idea of a larger mixed gender group, but struggling with the idea of her hanging all mint with just one or two guys without you.

Just share your feelings - don't say this is something she can't do.  Wait to see how she responds.  It's very possible there were more people there.  It's possible the others left earlier and she was still just having fun hanging out with a couple friends and didn't realize it would bother you. She might be open to setting some compromise boundaries that let her have fun but lane you feeling more comfortable.  Or she might not, at which point you make some hard decisions.

Btw - I noticed most of the positive things you mentioned about the relationship were about your families, not about you two directly. That might be something to think about. "

Additionally, you're 16. You don't know what kind of situation your family is in at the moment, or what kind of tax issues may have affected their return(s). Expecting nice birthday presents because of tax return season is a little much. "

Politely tell her why it is not a good idea for you to keep the truck, and then suggest that you try selling it for her as you understand that the whole process might be overwhelming for her right now.  Good luck, and sorry for your loss."
ap27ya,"NAH sure meaningless tchatchki presents are wasteful, but tell her something you actually want and will use. You don't have to tell her you hate her present choices, just give her other options. You could send her a link to a book you've been meaning to read and then donate that to a library when you're done if she neeeeeeds to buy something. You could ask her to donate the money instead to a local charity in your name. You could be like, ""hey mom I had a brilliant idea, instead of buying each other gifts this year, let's go to a nice restaurant when I'm visiting! Or go somewhere new. It'll be a lovely experience we will remember""

Basically talk to your mom and offer solutions."
ap2bhc,"NTA.   


She shouldn't really be involving other people in this because it's between the two of you.

&#x200B;

Word of advice though? Just move on. It doesn't matter what she said or did now. I know it's hard to move forward but you're only hurting yourself by worrying about it. It's also usually a pretty good idea to just stop talking to someone after a breakup. If you still want to be friends in the future that's perfectly okay, but you both need time to find your way to closure on your own time and it's a billion times harder to do that if the person is still in your life. "
ap2ely,"Mega NTA. Your ex is clearly being manipulative, and is clearly the villain. Your mother is simply the victim of his deception, so I wouldn’t say she’s the asshole.

ap3xfl,"NAH - it's normal that you talk behind someone's back with your coworker, about a situation like this. Especially if the man did something stupid and tried to rip off tags. On the other hand it's understandable that the son was upset as you insulted his dad.

ap4vrd,"The tree legalities aside, how about this.  You did something you've done several times before.  Your new neighbor saw it for the first time and responded in a defensive way.  Obviously, from their point of view, something was not good.

So, knock on their door.  Make nice and apologize if you have offended them.  Feel free to let them know the old neighbors encouraged picking up the lemons and it didn't even cross your mind that your actions would upset them.  You may even wish to offer them some store bought lemons to replace the ones you took.

My recommendation is that you overwhelm them with kindness.  Let them either become friends or expose themselves as something else.

I hate the idea that we owe our parents something.  You don’t owe your parents shit. Sure they raised you but they accepted that responsibility when they decided to have kids. You don’t owe them for that.

ap61ji,NTA geo said a cuss word
ap6eeq,"NTA, I mean if your cool letting her go out and not getting worried you would think she would do the same for you. Also, to say she doesn't trust the other drunk girls shows that a) doesn't trust you either to say no and b) that she doesn't trust herself. She's describing not trusting other girls cause they're drunk, isn't that exactly what she is doing? Going out to drink? I mean besides the obvious trust issues she has, and jealous nature, it seems to imply that she's got experience being an unfaithful drunk girl. Could be totally wrong too but if you don't trust the kind of person you are your self, maybe there's a reason.

So man I think you gotta tell her that your gonna go out alone sometimes and live your life, just like she wants to do herself. It's a two way street buddy, good luck"
ap6i55,"YTA it sucks when people turn up unannounced however it's one of those things you, as an adult, have to deal with. It wouldn't have killed you to see her for like and hour or two. Your sister wanted to see you and hang out and walked to see you in the cold. Sorry but yeah YTA. "
ap6k5t,"NTA for wanting to help- but I hope you know what you're doing by sending an adult dog to the shelter. I don't know about the municipal shelters where you live, but every place I've lived in the US a dog going to a shelter is usually a one way trip. "
ap6miu,"NAH - It's fine that you don't want to go out to a bar or clubbing with your aunt and uncle, but it's also fine that they do. I mean the clubbing thing is a little bit more unusual because clubbing is the worst and one of the best things about being a cool aunt or uncle is that you don't have to do that anymore. But a bar, assuming it's a chill bar and not some meat market, seems totally normal to me.
That being said you're not a jerk for not wanting to do it. if it's not something you're interested in, it's not something you're interested in."

in my opinion. Why strike up a friendship with your existing friend's ex at all? 

>I think she overreacted a lot, especially for someone who seemed to be so close to me.

That's really not for you to say. This is a person who manipulated her and was awful to her, and who you, who was supposed to be her friend first, started having a friendship with. I don't believe in 100% blind loyalty but you didn't have ANY loyalty to A, as far as I can tell."
ap77mf,"NTA.

Tell him you don't like him telling you how to do your job and you find it condescending and not helpful at all. That if you want professional advice from him, you'd explicitly ask him for it.

I would take him off the Info Diet on a ""let's see"" basis. Tell him you're happy to include him in your work stories again, but if he tries to give you unsolicited advice, you will stop telling him about it since he clearly cannot respect that very simple boundary."
ap7al5,"NTA. 

It sounds like he has a drinking problem if he becomes an issue in public but gets belligerent about suggestions to maybe cool it for a bit so he can sober up. Alcoholics can get very defensive and angry in situations like this.

You should probably schedule a chat with him when he's sober to clear the air and explain your side of things. If he's still an asshole, it's probably time for you two to have some space from each other."
ap7ep0,"NTA 

You didn't 100% refuse his affection, you did kiss him, you just didn't want a full make-out session with morning breath. That's not unreasonable or germaphobic at all. Some people are fine with morning breath, some aren't.  You're not, that doesn't make you an asshole.
Washing your hands before meals is just good hygiene. Not germaphobic either.

OP, don’t shit where you eat. Next time, I’d just keep my friends and my romantic interests separate.

Edit: it looks like most people are going NTA, which I am pretty surprised by. I just think that OP should have considered the consequences of his actions before he took them.

You're perfectly within your rights to seek whatever future you want for yourself. You and your siblings need to come to an agreement about how best to handle your parents' needs. It shouldn't have landed on you just because you happened to be born last.

It's okay to assert yourself now and seek something for YOU rather than what's best for the people around you. Everyone else has no problem seeking for themselves, it's fair to do the same."

I'm of the firm belief that actions make assholes, not thoughts or feelings. As long as no one is aware of your amusement, you're in the clear.

However, if someone close to the situation (like your brother or parents) realized and were hurt by it, you would be the asshole. I think it's human nature to find morbid or unpleasant things funny or absurd, it's a coping mechanism and there's nothing wrong with it - just make sure to remain sensitive about the feelings of the people who are impacted by it."
ap83lb,"NTA

but how did you guys not discuss any of this earlier? "
ap86c9,"YTA- It's okay to date casually and not be in love with the person you are dating. It's okay to not want to start a future together, or live together.

But you need to make that clear to the person you are with, because it sounds like he is assuming that you feel the same way that he does. Not saying to break up, but I would have a conversation with him about this, because he is only going to keep pushing the issue of moving in together. If he's okay with cooling the jets and seeing where it goes then you will be way less stressed about this."
ap86d8,"NTA.

That she's pushing after she got rejected is not a *great* sign. I'd sit her down ASAP and explain that she's making you feel uncomfortable. Lay the boundary now before a line's crossed and the friendship no longer is salvage-able."
ap86zd,"NTA

People who ask to hang out with the pretext of wanting something are just the metaphorical worst. "
ap8act,"YTA
From the onset your controlling her. Trying to stipulate what she can or cannot do ( in regards to clubs). It all boils down to trust. Either you trust her to make a healthy decision or you do not. By not even allowing her the opportunity to make a decision your are controlling her.

If you want a relationship to work then you need to trust. 

This shouldn’t be a stipulation of dating you. 

I would recommend taking a step back and evaluating yourself.  

"
ap8amo,"I'm going to say YTA.

You admit you are lazy and clearly this is an issue for your parents. Your brother may not have done any household chores *that you saw* that day but you can't know all the ins and outs of what he does every day, and for all you know he contributes more to the household than you do on average. 

But most importantly, you're staying with your parents, as an adult, and they asked you to do something. This isn't the time to start crying that it's not fair that brother doesn't do it, and the vegetarian excuse doesn't hold much water with me. 

I assume you're living there rent-free when your parents are no longer obligated to provide for you. Just do the damn dishes, dude."
ap8b65,NTA.  It's a $3.00/hr job.  You do what you need to to get out when you want to.  You do not owe anyone shit in a job like that.

ap8g9i,"YTA. Undoubtedly. Why accept the gifts and then turnaround and sell them? That is the move of a world-class asshole.

Is your dad happy? Is that your concern? No. You are simply feeling out how you can profit from the situation and want the moral justification to do so... Well you ain't gonna find it here. Grow up. "

ap8n85,"NTA--- pretty sure those button pushes are a totally renewable resource, and there will be enough for everyone. As long as you aren't like cutting off someone in a wheelchair who cares who presses the button instead of pulling the handle"
ap8pno,"NTA but I think you got the reasoning from your oldest wrong.  
It's really doubtful that he just wants you to spend money for the sake of spending money (and I also doubt that you spend exactly the same amount for both of your other kids or that this amount is also equal to whatever the cost of his class would be) If you were to find 2 absolutely identical class elsewhere, do you really think he'd ask you to get the most expensive to show that you care about him as much as the other kids? Of course not.  


It's about independence, your 17 years old son does not want to train with his dad or train somewhere where is dad also works and therefore would be privy to info about your son's progress that your son might not want him to know. No matter if your husband claimed that he would not interfere and treat him equally etc etc, we both know that's just not going to happen. He's 17, he just wants to have his own activity for himself without being 'the teacher's kid' and having his dad on his back. Let him have it.

The person who has an obligation is your father, not you. "
ap8s10,"YTA. I get him wanting to blow off steam after a week at work, especially if he's not able to enjoy himself the other nights because of work. I think he should have actually invited you along, but that's another issue. 
You seem to be dictating his schedule on his day off. He told you, prior to drinking/being hungover that he did NOT want to hang out with your cousin, and you pressed it anyway. YOU wanted to go shopping. YOU wanted to go to dinner with your parents. Maybe ask him for input on what he wants to do with his free time as well? "
ap8ua8,"NTA.

He scammed you. Learn from this and make sure it doesn't happen again."
ap8v5r,"NAH.

You have a valid reason to end things and you told her what it was. Of course she's not going to be delighted with it, especially since she didn't do anything *wrong*... you're just not into it.

It sucks but there's nothing you can do. You let her down as gently as possible."
ap8w33,"NTA.

HR has a right to that information. He stole more money than my student loans and he wasn't going to fess up until he got caught. He's a bad person. Tell them everything."
ap8y3u,"NTA.

That was hard to read, dude. Your father is abusive, plain and simple. Whatever his issues, there's no good reason to abuse a child, the person that depends on you for everything *because they have no other choice*. His issues are not an excuse for his behavior.

You're not wrong to feel negatively about him, and you can call it ""hate"" if that feels right to you. It would be in your best interests to have space from him for your own mental health. Your mother should understand and should support you, but in the instance that she doesn't? You need space from her, too. An enabler of an abuser is *no better* than the abuser. She's an adult and it was her duty to protect you kids, and if she saw what he was doing and didn't stop it, then she's guilty, too.

For your own mental health, you *need* to get out as soon as you possibly can. Try to work something out with your brother if he's younger than you so you guys can stay in touch - because when you're gone, he's going to be the sole target and he'll need some support. 

I'm so sorry you had to deal with this, man. DM me if you ever need to talk."
ap8zk0,YTA. This is your wife. She deserves for you to at least tell her face to face. 
ap944s,"NTA - it’s perfectly reasonable to not want to be in the same room with an abuser. I’d recommend planning a one on one bday celebration with your nephew, either the day before or after his party. Heck, if the party is in the afternoon, take him out for a fun breakfast. You can still celebrate with him and maintain your boundaries with your mother. "

ap9569,"NTA/INFO

First of all, I am so sorry for your loss. Please stay strong.

You are definitely NTA for expecting your closest family members to check up on you during this hard times. However, you didn't describe the relationship you have with your father and his wife. If you have been estranged or you were never close to begin with, maybe that's why he opted for the trip instead of supporting his grieving daughter. If you have a decent father/daughter communication, his behavior is unacceptable and shady. It could be that his wife is persuading him to go on the damn trip, but he could spare a few minutes per day just to ask you and your girls how you are coping.

Two wrongs don’t make a right. You have a right to choose who your friends are, and you should filter that carefully and then treat those friends kindly.

If you don’t like her, you don’t have to sabotage her relationship with your other friends, you can just tell her the joke is tired, and that you don’t really want to be her friend, and then just avoid talking to her.

apctv4,"NTA - absolutely not.  I'd dump him for being so reckless, immature, and uncompassionate.

Your completely right to be upset. It hurts to loose a friend for a silly reason.

If the main reason is because your girlfriend is afraid of getting attached... that's murkier. Yes, the boyfriend agreed and the decision to move in with a cat is separate from getting a new dog. However, the cat is primarily the girlfriends. It seems fair that the boyfriend should get a pet that's primarily his since he has to go through the heart break with the cat if you go to different schools.

Bottom line: just wait a year and get a dog then. Your future is unstable. Committing to a pet (much less a relationship) with such instability in your futures is foolish."

It means weekly practice room piano lessons where you chat a lot. Like friends do. 

> I confess EVERYTHING in my mind while still respecting her relationship...I tell her to leave me alone.

So you ""respect"" her relationship by dumping your feelings on her, and then get mad and act like a victim because she doesn't like you back? 

> She is completely star gazed at me and jealous as she thinks I'm dating my female friend 

How do you know she's jealous? Are you reading ""signals"" again? You ""feel"" she still has feelings for you based on... what? 

> but she has way too many guy friends. Makes me think I'm not anyone important to her...

So are you or are you not special to her? Make up your mind. Also, what is ""way too many guy friends""? You sound like you're primed to be the controlling jealous type. Maybe you're projecting the jealousy thing onto her? 

> AITA for ignoring her and cutting her off from my life?

apfidc,"NTA

Why in the world are you financially supporting your nearly grown ass boyfriend?

Don't fall into the trap. Relationships are partnerships, they're not adoption. You signed up for a boyfriend, not a baby.

I know that a lot of people are saying ""no assholes here"" but your boyfriend's behavior is throwing up red flags *everywhere* - codependent, needy, immature, doesn't listen to your needs, hides away in your bedroom while playing on systems that *you've* afforded him while ignoring your family.

apfrva,"NTA.

Your BF told you he would come in ""in a bit"". It doesn't matter if the exact meaning of that is vague, it's obvious that he was implying it wouldn't be as long as it was. He could just have told you ""I'll stay up late with my friends"" and that would be ok by my standards, but it wasn't the case.

Also him inviting to stay someone (I assume he knows) you are not comfortable with, without telling you or anything is something I really don't like.

apgtf6,"NTA , I would say that the mothers choice to make your boyfriend dress up wouldn’t be a bad one, and creating a, what I assume is, a surprise costume for a party, is a pretty good idea and seems sweet, regardless of it seeming cringey.

Your concern on if your boyfriend would actually like this costume seemed perfectly reasonable. You didn’t spoil the surprise, but only offered criticism in a (hopefully) polite way, making sure the party is fun for your BF.
The way they responded though, shows they took it way too personally, as if it was an attack on their judgement. Responding the way they did, and even going as far as to spoil the entire surprise for the sake of talking about how you’re a negative person and how you’re “bad in her books” turns this situation from a “No ones the asshole” into a “they’re the assholes”."
apgtxa,"YTA, dont take peoples things without permission no matter what"
aph0j3,"NTA - I'm going against the grain here but I'm not against snooping in the situation of serious suspicion. You know your girlfriend, you know how she acts, you know when she's acting really weird about a certain person. As long as it isn't wholesale ""look at everything because she's being sketchy with one person"". I also don't see you as an asshole because if you *hadn't* snooped, you'd probably have been cheated on for a lot longer before you stumbled on it the ""right way"", and this is true of a lot of people. Everyone says break up if you don't trust someone, but that's ignoring the reality of relationships and human behavior. People rarely *want* to break up over suspicions like this, and almost always need the push of seeing it explicitly laid out. I find it really unlikely that all these people have never been suspicious of a significant other, and if they were they just broke up with them (or talked to them and gotten lied to for months because they trust them so much) rather than figure out if the suspicions are based in anything."
aph29x,"ESH, I personally would be pretty pissed if someone missed 5 consecutive dates with me, I’d probably give up on them to be honest. That said, I don’t think that’s an excuse to call you a cunt etc. It’s impossible for us to say how much of it is excuses/depression because we don’t know how severe you have it, but you should probably see a doctor/therapist if it is effecting your life this much."
aph7ye,"YTA for your clickbait title. I google searched that and it took forever to find some obscure reference to how that may be a slur but not really. He’s calling his girlfriend a pet nickname, not a racist nickname. Hopefully HR ignores your complaint cause you’re looking for any excuse to get this guy fired instead of asking to change cubicles. He sounds like a douche but trying to use some ultra obscure maybe not racial slur to get him fired isn’t the way to do it."
aph8ho,"ESH.  Yes, people shouldn't be screaming at you for not liking a song, but dismissing the problems it's trying to facilitate a discussion about with ""well, I don't think any of that's bad enough to complain about"" is tone-deaf in the extreme.  Loving your country doesn't and shouldn't mean you're not allowed to say anything bad about it ever, any more than thinking it has problems has to mean that everything is terrible."

apiik5,"YTA. If everyone was uncomfortable with you spending the money, they are entitled to their feelings.  They let you know they were uncomfortable and then you put them in the further awkward position of choosing the flavors of something they were uncomfortable with you giving them.

apilub,YTA for expecting him to read your mind and for getting so mad about him just enjoying ONE of the items you bought. In a marriage it is a partnership so you need to learn how to communicate better. Did you tell your husband before hand that you specifically were not allowing him to enjoy the items you purchased? Next time you could have just gently reminded him that those coolers you bought for only yourself... And it sounds like your alcohol problem might extend a bit beyond just watching the calories?

Why are the odds of her getting a visa low?

If she successfully emigrated to Canada, would it make a huge difference in her and her family’s quality of life?

This is probably above Reddit’s pay grade. I am asking these questions so you really think about the situation she is in, and so you can hopefully make the decision that is best for you and your sister.

You don't just get to decide you're done and then everyone forgives the amount of massive betrayal and violation of trust you've been doing for years before that. It doesn't work that way. You have to deal with the consequences of your actions, and the consequences are that your actions are going to be transparent because you've shown that you had no problem lying to her for years until it was beneficial to *you*, not her, to tell the truth.

apmnyu,"YTA. The ""biology"" component is a cop out. There is nothing inherent in having a uterus that makes you want to spend time with a kid, especially an infant.

If you feel like you can't be in a relationship right now then there's nothing wrong with ending it. You shouldn't be trying to ""force"" a relationship.

Did you talk about this with your therapist? Also r/relationship_advice maybe."
apmvzi,"NAH.  It's reasonable to not want to bring a child into the world who won't be able to have a completely healthy life, but the situation comes across as if your husband's very existence is damaged by these issues.

He may have some feelings about sperm selection to prevent a child from having to suffer through the things your husband has to endure on a daily basis."

Your parents are the assholes for encouraging her to do something she isn't suited for over getting a free ride to college (she could easily do both, like modeling school or courses in the summer if she really wants). 

Obviously your parents and everyone has pretended this is a good dream so she's not an asshole for being upset about her dream not being supported, especially out of the blue.

You were harsh maybe but looking out for her and not just citing your own opinions but also those of modeling coaches who dropped her and specifically said it wouldn't be likely for her to succeed (which your parents hid - so fucked up of them).

I had a student who wanted to be a singer/actress/model and to be brutally honest that was NEVER EVER going to happen but her parents did the same thing as yours and even took her out of school for a week to go across the country to ""compete"" in a scam competition that's really a place where agents and managers go to find desperate clients.... it was pretty sad and it didn't do her any favors because she neglected her studies, *convinced* she was going to make it big."

Towels may be a small task, but his logic can apply to a lot of things, ""The dishes won't take you long"", ""walking the dog won't take you long"" ""Taking the kids from and to school won't take you long"", do you see the spiral?

My advice would be to sit down with him, lay some ground rules, delegate the work between you, come to an agreement on how you're going to do it, a few ways you could do it:

A. i wash, you fold

B. You wash, i fold

C. I wash and fold these days, you wash and fold these days

&#x200B;

There are a lot of ways to go about this, right now, *because i don't see you guys having a set agreement,*  it pretty much is a trivial matter, and it's maybe a little weird for you to get very frustrated over it, but i understand your irritation completely.

&#x200B;

SO! Come to an agreement, do your part, if he doesn't do yours, you're completely in the right to go apeshit.

aps56f,"NAH.  It's understandable that you would be upset at their lack of concern.  On the other hand, unless your room mates are very close personal friends that have sworn to be with you through thick and thin, they have no duty to put their lives on hold for hours or days when you have a crisis.  They called for help.  That's all they are obligated to do.

Just keep in mind that they aren't acting like close personal friends if they ever need something important from you.
"
apsazu,"NAH. Sometimes things work out awkwardly. 

In any case, you and your friends were just hanging out as usual, so it wasn't really a big deal that you left early. In her case, a friend was laid off work so it makes sense that she'd want to be there to support her. There's a difference there. 

Also, you were originally just going to meet up once. You ended up having lunch AND a mini date. That's still more than you had originally planned. I don't think this is a big deal, and I wouldn't get hung up over it. "

If your friend loves this guy, she needs reassurance that her boyfriend is **not** likely to commit suicide and that he's manipulating her.  She needs her friends to stand by her instead of leaving her alone.  "

Any time you move in with an SO there are going to have to be compromises and trade offs.  This’ll be one of them. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong or she is.

apwyt2,"YTA. Read the room - he said he was busy and really had to work. If he's not interested in sex, you need to respect that because that's what consent is. It's shitty to try and convince him when he told you multiple times he had work to do, you were not respecting his boundary so I'm not surprised he snapped. You said he was stressed out and you purposefully ignored his feelings and then left dramatically which further caused him not to do work thinking he had to chase after you. "

apxj9z,"NTA. Just to be clear, I was a bit confused because originally I thought you were talking about your HUSBAND's Sister-in-Law, not his ACTUAL sister. You're talking about his sister, correct? That would mean she's your future sister-in-law. You might want to edit your post to make that more clear.

Anyway, either way she sounds like a textbook narcissist, making everything about her and just generally being a bitch. You're not the asshole. Your future husband, however, needs to learn how to grow a pair and tell his sister to stop treating his future wife like shit. I worry about what might happen if there are other narcissists in his family that he's not willing to stand up to and set boundaries with because of his apparently non-confrontational nature. I've seen this happen in my own family because my very non-confrontational-by-nature brother is married to a bitchy narcissist who treats him and my family like shit, not to mention the rest of her bitchy narcissist family that also treats my family like shit.

Think hard before potentially marrying into a shitty narcissist family. The entire rest of your life could potentially be plagued by drama and bullshit."

First, are you me from the future? Because your life sounds almost identical to mine. ESPECIALLY the ""talking to the dog thing"" My narcissist mom does this all the time, in fact, she just did it the other day. It was great. Also, she is very likely to get dementia (she is already showing some signs), like her own narcissist mother did, which leads me to my first real point why you are NTA.

&#x200B;

You can't help what is coming out of her mouth. This is the nature of the condition. My grandmother, in her many years suffering before her passing, did exactly this. He filter lifted and she very often spoke of her regrets and the past. Her walls completely broke down. My mom really bonded with her during this time, even though the conversations grew exponentially clouded. It was therapeutic for both of them.

&#x200B;

I honestly don't even understand why your friend is mad at you. Maybe he thinks you're somehow happy she has this illness because you are finally getting some peace of mind? You are obviously not happy she has dementia and you are just seeing the silver-lining of the situation. I really think your friend is completely misinterpreting what you are feeling. I think this kind of thing is actually relatively common with people at the end of their life, though correct me if I'm wrong. I feel like I hear stories all the time of people expressing their regrets when they are nearing the end and of family reconciliation.

Really though, I'm sorry you are going through this with your mom, and I hope the best for you and your family during this time. "

It is isolating and can become cripplingly depressing to be, in essence, alone without an easy way to go home at a moments notice. 

Starting off at a school closer to home or  junior college/community college isn’t a bad idea at all. It’s more affordable and helps make necessary adjustments to college life. 

ETA: I’ve watched my own students crack under the pressure of adjusting to college life (dorms, newfound independence, parties, own schedules, etc) and seeking out help is something students have to do themselves. It isn’t impossible as there’s hundreds of thousands of students in college but in my experience students don’t actively seek out help or know where to go to get the help they need and they wind up suffering in silence. Many schools are pushing towards mental health awareness/holistic wellbeing approaches but that’s still largely up to the student themselves. "

The average joe wouldn’t dare ask you to leave. "

aq8nw5,"YTA because this is Bridezilla behavior.  Your future husband's best friend who is also a groomsman lives with his serious girlfriend.  Even if you don't really like her, even if she's a bitch (unless she's so far out there bitchy she'd create a crazy scene at the wedding) it's rude to specifically exclude the serious SO of a wedding party member.  Yes, it's your wedding, but choosing to act like that isn't a good look.

Be the bigger person here."

an 8 hour round trip to babysit is INSANE.

**edit:** seriously, these people can't find even ONE suitable babysitter in their area? or is it that they're cheap and they don't want to pay for it? My husband and I live over a thousand miles from any of our family members, so if we want to go out we hire a babysitter. If we can't get a babysitter, we don't go out, end of story. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
aq8xzx,"INFO. Is the visit for a special occasion, and how often do you see them?

Edit after more info.

NTA.  Sometimes you’re just wore out and need that downtime.  It’s unfortunate you had a trip planned but you aren’t missing anything major or a once a year visit."
aq9195,"NTA

Don’t feel bad, it’s complicated. When you fall in love with someone and eventually break up it doesn’t mean you no longer care about each other. It’s healthy to keep caring, but contact should be limited to things like this and nothing more. For me, I’m in my third long term relationship and plan to get married. Do you think it would be healthy if I hated my two ex girlfriends? I don’t hate them, I actually still have a memory of love for them both and I hope I always do. Do I talk with them? No, never actually. But if a situation like yours came up then I’d want them to know that even if I don’t want to spend my life with them I still have compassion for them. 

Edit: to deny your continued compassion for past relationships is the source of pain, not healing and moving on. If you can’t care about a person you used to love then the only thing left to do is be angry you ever wasted your time with them. "
aq92z2,"YTA but just barely. 

It's their business and relationship. Your sib is probably in more pain than you seem to acknowledge and is entitled to chase happiness. Advocate for the children 100% but not at the expense of someone trying to be happy. "
aq979k,"NAH

tbh this is really hard to give judgment on. On some level, if she isn't a *complete* pile of trash, I'd say you should support your friend. But if she's really that awful I can't fault you for not wanting to share your day with her, but you should expect to hurt your friend's feelings a lot in the process.

**Edited to add: I’m too late to change the flair I think but after reading OP’s edit, absolutely NTA holy shit.**"
aq999o,NTA - your friend sounds like a Nice Guy™. Can't possibly imagine how someone else might have different opinions. He really should have made sure you were 100% happy to play the game before he bought it.

Consider posting a review to this effect on Google/Yelp/etc."
aq9cwi,Are you sure you guys are 21 and not 13?
aq9du8,"NAH.

Everyone has different standards for a relationship, and in a friend group it's common to develop crushes on each other. I don't think you're wrong for laying down a boundary and I don't think he's wrong for having a different one.

He should really consider whether or not his actions are leading Brad on, though. That would not be cool of him."
aq9h9m,"NTA for being lied to. Hopefully you're not still talking to that pos guy though, even if they're dating. Then you'd be TA"
aq9hbg,NTA. I get unpaid lunch and I promise you I won't do a damn thing for free unless it's an emergency.
aq9kdl,"NTA. This all seems very fishy to me. I kind of agree that if you trust you SO then you should trust them around exes, but that's when there aren't feelings attached from the ex to your current partner. To be honest, in your situation I'd consider leaving my partner if she did the same shit your boyfriend is doing.

I know that sounds like I'm jumping the gun, but let's just summarize here:

Ex clearly has feelings for BF. She wants to keep this from you, probably which isn't actually weird! Even visiting for a week -- not necessarily weird, if everything is above board. I can't say whether it was.

What is weird is the lack of boundaries your boyfriend has with his ex. She can show up at 1am to ""vent"" for an hour and a half? Girl, boundaries. It can wait until the morning; I don't care what it is. And then when you guys have argument, he seemingly vents to her over the phone? Boy, *boundaries.* That isn't right.

Meanwhile, your boyfriend isn't really being forthcoming. It's fine to be friends with an ex, but if your partner is uncomfortable with it you should be trying to do things to show them that everything is above the table -- like mentioning when you go and hangout with them alone until 1AM. Were there even work friends around? I'd sure like to know, because that sure sounds like a date to me. 

Just... boundaries, man. Boundaries. Communication. Be friends with your ex! But show boundaries and communicate with your SO. Your boyfriend doesn't seem to be doing these things."
aq9kvt,"NAH

Why would having a big party make anyone an asshole? You all had a small wedding when you were younger. 10yrs later, you're more established and want to throw a bigger shindig. I don't see the problem at all. Honestly, I'm all for it."
aq9kyh,"i feel like INFO here, but for now YTA. again for now im going to assume the purpose of the agreement was for him to buy passes so that you can get to school. Seeing your SO is a little out of the range of that. I dont see why you dont just get a monthly pass so you dont have to worry about the individual ones. or maybe a part time job."
aq9kyi,"NTA. my SO is the same way as yours and I’m the same way as you when it comes to this subject. (It actually feels like reading something I wrote lol) anyways. NTA. Some people are just terrible when it comes to gift giving. I’ve personally learned that that’s not a language my SO expressed his love in, and to accept that. Don’t feel guilty for asking things that were promised to you! "
aq9l0u,"I would say NAH. You should respect his wishes if he doesn’t want to come out yet. It is reasonable for you to want to not lie to your GF, but I do think you are overacting slightly. There are no assholes here tho"
aq9rhv,"NTA. If they think think your driving is so bad, they can walk themselves to their destination. If they don't think it's that bad, then they can quit being assholes who are looking to get a rise out of you. You aren't a fucking taxi service."
aq9s9q,NTA going to a wedding is to celebrate their union not to give a gift. But are you sure it is over the gift and not because they’re honeymooning/celebrating/busy?
aq9uqx,"NTA. He's made his decision not to go because he is prioritizing school. If he chooses not to go, that's on him."
aq9yy3,"ESH. In this case youre the asshole for not throwing them out to begin with. Especially when you got into a physical altercation with the other person while pregnant. She is the asshole for not breaking up with said dipshit when there is obviously abuse going on. You cant force them to break up but you dont have to live with it happening around you, your fiancee and your unborn child. Shes being a bad friend and you are choosing your relationship with your friend over the person you love. Not only have they come in and been stressing you out but they have stressed your fiancee out and cost you money. People like that NEVER pay for replacements or repairs. Im not saying cut all ties, but dont let them hurt your relationship with your fiancee or harm your unborn child. Even stress can cause a miscarriage. This is obviously stressing you out."
aqa009,YTA.  Why did you even nitpick over this.
aqa5g5,"YTA - sounds like your girlfriend is the victim of sustained and serious abuse, and you judging her for not being self-aware about it is NOT helping. She has more important things to deal with than to worry about annoying her asshole boyfriend. 

&#x200B;

If you can't handle being in a relationship with someone who has been abused, leave. You will only make it worse for her. If you can't see how negatively you are affecting her, YOU are the naive one. "
aqa5rg,"NTA -

aqahcl,"NAH - You both are approaching schooling differently. It would be generous of you to help her, but it's not required. I do think that if you are going to stop giving her your notes, you should talk about that with her first. Let her know your concerns and that you don't feel valued when she does those things. See what she says. Would her paying you for notes make it seem more fair? What outcome would you like from that type of discussion with her? Just some things to think about. "
aqakt6,"YTA

No matter how much of a bitch, you can't not invite someone's SPOUSE when you invite them. If you did, you're setting up this guy for a fight with his wife as much as you are creating drama for yourself. I'd say just don't invite either of them."
aqalhm,NTA your SO is making a huge deal out of a unimportant matter. 
aqaowe,"NTA. 

She's your ex, and I'm sorry but if she can't deal with you hanging out with other people then you should cut her out of your life. Noone should be able to have that much control over you, especially not an ex 

Edit: also, she left you, yet feels like you're abandoning her by hanging out with someone else? She's a toxic, manipulative person. And I highly suggest you either tell her that she needs to step down and let you live your life, or seriously consider cutting her out of your life. You don't need that type of person "
aqaqaf,">Roomie is incredibly brusque with me - to the point where it seems like she's about to call the cops - and then tells me to get out. I don't need her to tell me twice.

NTA but you need to drop her reaction. You know exactly why she reacted that way. It was late at night and a man she doesn't know is in her apartment with her incapacitated roommate. Regardless of whether you were being a good person or not, she felt very uncomfortable and rightly so. She was probably pissed at her roommate too. I bet it isn't the first time she's gotten too plastered to handle herself. Just remember, that girl had to spontaneously react to a foreign situation involving a man in her home in the middle of the night.

I wouldn't worry about her reaction. It was just natural. You did the right thing. She just can't know what will happen next until it happens. You said what happened and you meant it, and you left. You did nothing wrong."
aqaqv4,YTA. You live free in their house.  It's not unreasonable for them to expect you to pitch in.  They shouldn't have to justify why or to remind you multiple times.

I feel like this would be more suitable on /r/relationships than here, asking ""Are my friends using me?"" or something. Because that's what your asking.

This is a sub for finding out if you're an asshole. But you can't really be an asshole for how you think or feel because you can't control that. You can only be an asshole for what you actually DO. You haven't described anything you've actually DONE in your post, so how can we judge? Eg. have you actually brought this up to them? Have you lashed out at them because of these feelings?

Though I kinda feel like YTA about the roleplaying...? If you don't like it, just don't participate? Why do you think you get to tell them not to do something they enjoy?"
aqbn3d,"Please do not cut out your dog's run to spend time with your girlfriend. You are the most important thing in the world to him and like you said,is an extra 30 mins with your gf really gonna change that much?"
aqbo37,"NTA. Most people I know do the common courtesy of pitching in for gas money if someone is giving them a ride, especially if it's frequent. If she's not chipping in at all, you're not an asshole if you tell her no. And to further that, it's your car and your time you are essentially giving her, under no obligation whatsoever. "
aqbs39,"NTA, omg! For one thing, you’re a woman just like the rest of us, so there’s no reason you shouldn’t attend a ladies-only event. For the other, the fact that showers are automatically ladies-only is stupid and old-fashioned. It sounded like L was perfectly happy to have you and S there and it was only R and P that cared. If L says you’re welcome, you’re welcome. It’s her day. 

I also didn’t get any indication from this story that S wants distance from you or anything, and it’s really nice that you want to get to know L more.

I’m sorry they made you uncomfortable :( don’t worry, it’s normal to find showers boring. They’re pretty dull and often have super weird gender norms built into them. "
aqbsbi,"NTA if you're enjoying the music, that's why someone made it. "

aqc22k,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I’m gonna say YTA. Let me start off by saying that I empathize with you: I also didn’t particularly want my extended family at my high school or college graduations, for various reasons.

Pretty much every other day of your college experience has been about you. Most days after your graduation, at least until you have your own family, are gonna be about you. If your college is at all like mine, there’s an entire week or so of festivities and celebrations before graduation day that are entirely about you.

Your college graduation actually isn’t about you so much: it’s more for your parents. It’s really the last time they get a moment like this. Let your dad have his day. If part of how he wants to experience the day involves his family tradition of having the entire extended family there, be accommodating. Most of your classmates will also be accommodating stupid family things that they don’t really want to deal with. Play the part. It’s 24 hours.

I would end a friendship because of that complete lack of boundaries and respect, whether it was a guy or a girl who kissed me. "

aqg2lb,"YTA - This should be about what she would want and what her family needs to grieve. You might be right or there might be more to their relationship than you knew, either way this is not your decision to make.

While you are under no obligation to contact this guy (and you shouldn't) it sounds like you are withholding information from her family that would help them find closure because you don't respect their opinion or her life choices."
aqg6nn,"NTA. And I can damn sure guarantee that if that day ever comes for you two, she’ll be less than thrilled if you were to stay home because it’s “not your day” and you “just gave the sperm.” "
aqg9uu,NTA. She could have let you know her plans changed and she was quick to react defensively. It sounds like you expressed yourself clearly and calmly.
aqgdge,"Yeah I think people here are forgetting how hurtful it is to be disinvited to something, especially by your SO and on a big trip. A lot of these issues probably wouldn't exist if he'd just been upfront about his dilemma with his SO, she might've even agreed with him. But making the decision before even discussing it with each other just seems kinda cold."
aqge6q,NTA. Spend every possible moment with your grandmother. Mine died in 2010 and when she was sick my mom and I flew to visit her literally every weekend for 3 months (tickets were super cheap on a small airline). I cancelled a ton of plans but I knew every moment could be my last. You’ll have the rest of your life to potentially spend with your boyfriend. You’ll regret not seeing your grandma while you can (praying all goes well for her though).

aqh7w1,"NTA you already have one son that's going to need a LOT of time and care it sounds like you don't even have time for a 'normal' child so if your second was the same I think you'd fall apart. It's also not bad to hope your child isn't autistic, autism isn't life ending but as someone with autism I would personally just rather not have autism it's not something desirable "
aqhb4c,"YTA, bordering on TIFU.  Good lord, if this happened to me and she told me to do it again and put more thought into it, it would confirm any doubt I had about her and that would be that.      Bullet dodged, enjoy your show."
aqhedy,"YTA- wow, how generous that she gets an ‘allowance’ to raise the child you impregnated her with! It’s so sweet that you considered that she might be exhausted from birthing this baby and then raising it while you’re away all day. You sound like a catch. 

Let me ask you a question- what would you be doing if you weren’t married? You’d have to... cook and clean for yourself, correct? You live in this house, you should be helping out with general cleaning and upkeep without being asked. Don’t get bent out of shape when she asks for help, just help her because these things need to get done. 

Finally, this woman is your partner not your maid. The childcare she provides has value and is likely saving you guys a ton of money. It’s fine to have a ‘traditional’ relationship if you both agree to it, but you need to recognize the value of her labor in the house. You are BOTH contributing adults. "
aqhfe3,"NTA - but you might be starting a fight that you can't win.

aqhp3u,"ESH, honestly. He clearly needs to pay more attention to what the hell he's doing. That's disgusting and absolutely not okay. You have every right to be upset.

The only thing that bothers me is you insulting him. I get being mad. I totally do. However, you know how hurtful it can be to hear things like that from people you care about. It's not always easy, especially when he's *very obviously being stupid,* but you should always try your hardest to avoid saying things like that."

If you notice before you pay, and don’t tell them, YTA. Irrespective of whether you’re alone or with a group (in your example, THEY would be the assholes)

Exception: If you genuinely don’t notice, if you pay and only realise at some time later that they undercharged you, then NTA. You’re under no *obligation* to check their work and if you miss it you’re in the clear. 

Note: in the U.K., to *knowingly* leave without telling them and paying the full amount owed IS classed as theft. Legally, not just morally. Of course, the burden of proof is difficult - all they’d have to say is “oh sorry, I didn’t realise” - so it’s unlikely anyone would be prosecuted, but that doesn’t change the law. And note also that if they call you the next day having realised their mistake, you’re still obligated to pay the balance!"

He deserved the truth. Asshole lied to him and manipulated him. All you've done is disabused him of that. John can't go around repeating those lies, hurting Sarah again and making John even more unpopular.

aqiand,That... That's not a sperm donation... You literally had sex with someone. Not only are you an asshole but you're an idiot too 
aqida9,"NTA

If you were in a smoking area and she bumped into you you are correct to think this is not your responsibility. You even went and tried to still be nice and attempt to come to a mutually agreeable situation. Totally justified to drop it for her nasty behavior too. In fact I am wondering if this isn't a validation SHP at this point."
aqifqx,"NAH - You had good intentions here. But it sounds like you do need to tell your wife *why* you suggested taking the adult child instead of yourself. Of course she wants to spend time with you, you are her spouse - suggesting it in that manner could be mistaken for not wanting to go and trying to fob her off.

Apologize for the misunderstanding - and ask if you could invite adult child to go with the two of you and go as a group. If adult child says they'd rather have 1 on 1 time with your wife (and I'm assuming her mother), offer to step aside but make sure she knows you'll make up the time with her - doing something else."

aqiqec,NTA. I would feel like you do in that situation. 
aqiuv7,"NTA

Usually a sudden change in behaviour like this means cheating."
aqiwwk,"YTA. You fucked your girlfriend without condoms and tried to pressure her to get an abortion at five months, and now your son will grow up without a father. And since your parents are taking care of the kid it probably means you could at least be involved.

Sure, she was selfish to hide things from you- but to not get an abortion at five months? Hell no she wasn't. ""She was selfish"" doesn't outweigh ""I'm being outrageously selfish and an asshole"", and it sure as hell doesn't void it.

Edit: From your edit it looks like you're trying to waive off criticism that you're in the wrong by smearing us as calling you misogynist, which I at least didn't do. Sort of redoubles the fact that you're an asshole."
aqj315,"NTA.

You don't let into your house people you don't fully trust. Specially if it's not only your house but your mom's.

aqj4fe,"NAH

Friends drift apart and change, it’s only natural. That said: your friend sounds depressed and unsure of his path in life, could probably use some positive role modeling and friendly support/nudging from a more life-success oriented friend, and maybe that’s you. If not, no big deal, move it right along and keep on doing you, but I bet your friend is struggling to tread water and doesn’t know what to do with his life and that’s why he’s lazing about all day on benefits (how does one get benefits? Is he disabled?) instead of pursuing greater things in lifeZ "
aqj6h8,NTA. Your dad needs to show respect especially living in YOUR house.

aqj7lg,ESH. He shouldn’t have used a slur and neither should you. 
aqj8cg,"NTA, but I feel like there is more to the story than her just simply being a bitch. People usually don’t go out to have a bad time, so I don’t think she’s being so rude on purpose.

This doesn’t mean you’re the asshole here, but she just sounds like someone who really doesn’t know how to carry themselves well. My aunt is the same. She isn’t horrible on purpose, she just has no clue how to handle herself in social situations.

From her perspective, you might just be stuck up or not understanding and considering the fact you usually stand by your partner, your friend just started to think she had the right opinion. "

EDIT: word"
aqkjql,"NAH I’ve been in your shoes so I get it. She’s had years to come to terms with it, you’ve had a month. She has other memories of him to help deal with the bad ones, you’re mind is very little but what you can picture him doing to her. When I was in your shoes, all I could picture when I looked at the guy was him screaming at her while she cried. If you love someone you’re going to be uncomfortable around someone who harmed them.

To her though, she went through it and got past it. She’s trying to move forward and you’re uncomfortableness about it might drag her back a bit and it’s interfering with her life now.  You’re both justified in your reasons though. You just have to keep trying and have a long talk with her about it, hopefully it goes well.

Edit: wording as I didn’t quite feel like my opening expressed what I was saying well enough."

You did what needed to be done, and they will get what they deserve. It's good that you reported their behaviour rather than keeping it to yourself. "
aqkxa2,"So you’re mad because you broke his shit and he won’t let you use it? 

YTA. Doing stuff for others isn’t a get out of jail free card when you need something from them. It’s nice that you’re such a good friend that you would loan him things but he’s not required to lend you something of his that you broke once just because you choose to do things for him. If you no longer choose to do things for him that’s well within your right:"

aql0nb,"YTA - That was such a small thing, and pretty self-centered too.

If he got so angry and upset that you wanted to spend a few hours with your bestie on your birthday (especially after having already celebrated with him and spent several days with him) then imagine how bad he might be for other milestones in the future! You do NOT want to end up with the kind of person that believes they have a right to monopolize every bit of your time because it's <insert any holiday>."
aqlr8f,"YTA.

There's no such thing as 'taking a break,' just 'ending the relationship but putting off actually saying it in the hopes that the other person gets the hint.'

You don't get to put another person's life on hold like that.  Either you want to be with her, in which case you need to be actively enlisting her help, or you don't want to be with her, in which case, cut her loose and let her find her own happiness."

Hey, you don't like this woman, you don't have any obligation to talk to her.

Your brother saying he was tricked into marriage, however.. that's kind of an asshole thing to do. You do not get married by accident, the same way you don't get tricked into marriage.

I would personally want to know if the dude I was seeing tried to get with a bunch of younger girls at the workplace. She probably thinks she's a special one-off. Your co-workers are infuriating. ""He just wants to find someone"" - He can get on a dating app then and stop harassing women at work."

I have to put this on you, because it seems like you believe some solution is just gonna materialize like Scotty beams it down from the Enterprise. 

You're gonna have to create one. I mean I feel for you, that sucks, but until you are active in expressing your thoughts and feelings to find an active solution, I can't really suggest anything for you. That's on you. 

Well the downvotes are starting. That's awesome. The situation wasn't created by you, but you're allowing it to continue. The solution is open communication. "

aqo0w9,NTA but you are kinda sending mixed signals if you're standing near the exit stopping most kids most times because it looks you're taking the role but then do a sloppy job at it. I know you're trying to be nice but you end up being a false comfort that can't actually be relied on. If you can I'd sit on the bench nearest the exit if it was still in intercept distance and like not get up unless it's your kid making a dash for the exit.
aqo1k5,"NTA

....but I suspect you're leaving something out. If she's **mad** (as in actually angry at you, you guys had a fight or she brought it up passive aggressively later, or something) I can 100% guarantee it's not because you saw that movie without her. She's mad about something else.

If when you say ""she is mad"" you mean ""she said 'Oh, you asshole, I wanted to see that. Why didn't you wait for me?'"", that's not her being mad. You're making way too big a deal out of this, it doesn't matter."

aqpabv,"ESH. Your brother should have been more sympathetic, and I believe you should have told your family before the weeding. With as something as big as a divorce, it takes priority over other things and you really should have called them immediately after so you could get the proper advice and support.

And dont worry there is a world out there after highschool so don't stress if you have trouble getting friends there. "
aqq977,"YTA. I'm a POC that passes as white. 

Have you considered that maybe the POC are just sticking out to you more because they're ""different""? 

Maybe you're remembering them more because you have a harder time understanding them? 

Maybe you're running into a confirmation bias type situation where whenever you see a Hispanic or Asian family come in, you start to think ""oh no, not another one"" effectively giving you the ability to say ""I knew it!"" if they prove to be a difficult customer. So instead of remembering the 3 shitty white people you just dealt with, you only remember the non-white ones because you were actively thinking about it. 

Also, I would consider the percentage of how many customers are white vs POC at your location. If you only have one Hispanic customer a day and that customer was shitty, you're going to remember the one shitty Hispanic guy. Maybe you won't remember the 20 shitty white men in suits that hit on you and talked down to you, because that's just ""on par"" for what you usually see in a day. 

*EDIT* 

Have you ever been at work and had 3 terrible white women customers in a row? Have you then thought ""fuck, white women fucking suck?"" Have you then dreaded the next white woman to come to your counter? Why not? Based on your post, if you had 3 shitty Hispanic family customers in a row, your mind would go to ""fuck, Hispanic families suck"" and then you'd dread the next Hispanic family. 

This is why YTA and this is why I'm calling it out as racism. Because you're basically judging an entire race as a whole when you definitely wouldn't do that to white customers if they acted the same way. "

aqqzt4,"YTA for being so vague about this whole thing where you just say that she was wrong and you were being a nice guy. You're broken up, you already agreed not to do the thing, and you broke your agreement just because you decided that that was the cool thing to do, never mind how she feels about it. Also, she's not ""your girl"". You two need to distance yourselves and stop pretending that you're dating or broken up, choose one."
aqr0f7,"NAH. if you don’t want to cheer, you don’t have to... you *would* be an asshole if you were open about your distaste, but it sounds like you kept it to yourself. "
aqr2km,"NTA, you eatablished boundaries, you were clear about where you were at, and now you're maintaining those boundaries. At some point you can't keep giving in to the guilt trips and passive aggressiveness. It might be better to say ""If I feel like hanging out, I'll reach out to you, but as it stands now I don't appreciate being pressured to spend time with you based on guilt."""
aqr6dg,YTA. She clearly wasn't holding the door open for you and then you made a smug remark. 
aqrcn6,"NTA - you do bong rips, you forfeit your right to cry ""asthma!"" around smokers. "
aqrel2,"NTA, your dad was acting like a child, well both your parents were acting like children."
aqrlp7,NTA -- a gracious host doesn't force someone to eat
aqrpjg,"NAH... although I would say slightly an asshole for feeling embarrassed by your partners job. You wouldn’t feel embarrassed if they were on office worker or a lawyer etc. Why feel embarrassed because your bf is a sex worker, and apparently a decent one if that’s his sole income. Do your part to end the stigma around sex work. But check with your partner first and see what he is willing to share about his work, if he would feel comfortable sharing it at all, or if he wants you to totally lie about it. You’re not an asshole for not wanting to hurt anyone or make them uncomfortable. "
aqrqbz,"NAH. 

It's your right to date whomever you want, based on whatever criteria you want. 

That being said, I personally think it's a stupid hill to die on and if I were he, this wouldn't be a hypothetical. I would have walked out on you that very moment. If you're going to be that unreasonable over something so trivial, we.wiuld.obviously have zero future. "
aqrqyr,NTA. Just because you’re related by blood does not mean you are obligated to see them. Some family members might look at it as “oh you’re better than us?” But honestly you need to channel your energy into what makes you happy and understand what you want to invest your time in. If it’s not with your nephew and his side of the family than that is your healthy decision to make. 
aqrr1y,"NAH.

Everyone has their sexual preferences and being up front about deal breakers is just fine.  She's also pretty clearly showing her dates exactly what kind of person she is and giving them ample opportunity to leave early.

It's shallow but not much different than choosing dates based on their pictures."
aqrv74,"NTA. You did't even ask her out. It's a really dumb thing to get upset and ghost someone over, too, and I think a red flag."
aqrvnb,NTA but you should definitely tell your uncle you invited her and don’t be upset if he doesn’t want to come anymore. 
aqrvy6,"YTA if you truly can’t seem to understand why he’d be hesitant. 

I’m a woman and I can understand his point of view. Imagine if you were infertile and your husband wanted some other woman to have his baby, while fully expecting you to raise that baby despite your own feelings toward the matter. I’d feel much more uncomfortable with that than adopting a child who is unrelated to either of us and also needs us to provide him/her with a great start in life. 

Just like how you feel having your own child is a biological imperative, you can understand that for the infertile partner seeing your partner conceive with a stranger’s DNA can also stir up negative innate feelings of jealousy, etc. 

Obviously the situation needs a lot of compromise and understanding but you, at the very least, need to try to understand where he’s coming from since you presumably would like him to provide for your child as well."
aqrw1v,"NTA - your house, your rules. No Jesus. "
aqrx7g,"NTA, but you did say that he never really gets you anything for special occasions anyway, so why re you getting your hopes up? Have you talked to him about this?"
aqs0e8,"NTA - you can be disappointed. That said, this holiday has warped millions of people's expectations. His complete lack of effort may be due to his own discomfort with the holiday.

He might not be romantic, or choses to demonstrate his affection in other ways. Maybe check out *The 5 Love Languages* and have him read it too. A little unsolicited advice...free of charge. "
aqs14o,"NTA, I just think it’s wild that people who aren’t Jewish are telling someone who is Jewish how they can refer to themself and their own fucking hair.

aqs58r,[deleted]
aqs6nt,"NTA, and I can relate to what you're going through. That's not an appropriate position to put your child in, regardless of the circumstances. My dad used to talk to me about my mom like I was his bartender, when he should have realized that despite their differences it was inappropriate. There are times when it makes sense to be completely transparent, but when it's just complaining it's not appropriate. Doesn't matter what your dad did, doesn't matter what your mom did, it's unfair to make you the middle-man. If they can't resolve the issues they have they should seek counceling or get a divorce, not expect you to be their confidant. 

 The fact that she's insinuating that you're a shitty son because you're trying to maintain those healthy boundaries speaks volumes. "

aqsdd8,"NTA - In any MDU (multi-dwelling-unit) the tenants are entitled to the general sounds of life. If your life is watching a little TV past 8PM or spending time with a friend then he has no reason to complain. If you were throwing bangers every night it would be a different story. If your brother is working full time and he is unsatisfied with his living situation he should find a way to cope with that - as an adult. 

Let him know that you plan on living your life. If he can’t handle that then he can look into sleep-aids or other living arrangements."
aqsfe8,NAH I understand your fears of critters but at the same time you knew it was an exotic place and that honestly comes with the territory. I think you’re overreacting a bit because that’s the norm in most exotic places and it’s not like you are about to die or anything. Keep your room nice and sealed so you won’t have to worry when you sleep but other than that I say just learn to deal with it and enjoy the experience.
aqsgsb,"NTA, it’s assholeish that they force you to do chores for a trip they also force you to go on. There’s teaching teenagers responsibility and that’s one thing but this seems inappropriate, especially if it’s cutting into your ability to eat a full meal or keep up in classes. "

aqt334,"Hey, NTA at all

I'd like to stress to you that this is not healthy at all. There are many men who will happily respect you and wear headphones if they are compelled to view such material. 

Hell, my husband drives me nuts by watching YouTube on double speed. All I have to do is gently remind him and he happily puts on earphones. My dislike for YouTube on double speed is no where comparable to your feelings when you hear his shows. He is absolutely a disrespectful piece of stinky stuff you flush down the toilet.

It's very good that you understand your limits and are taking care of yourself. Best of luck to you both. "
aqtkrg,"NAH. I wouldn't say you're an asshole, but it does always kind of feel...off when someone tells you that you have to be thankful for something. Thankfulness is just of those things you can't tell someone to have. Either they were thankful already and it comes off as insulting (implying they were not) or, you make them feel bad for not feeling thankful, and while of course this is sometimes warrented, it can make people quite defensive because it is equivilant to attacking thier character. Who knows, she may have been planning to suripise you with something when she returned, but by asking for it, you sort of negate her good will (if she had any). It also implys that you may have lent her the car  begrudgingly - and if that was the case, it would be better to say the reasons why you are reluctant, then she will know that it took more of you to lend the car and she will be more inclined to be thankful naturally.

aqtvn2,"YTA

1. You’ve cheated on this poor girl
2. You’ve ghosted her while having some sort of relationship with her
3. You think it’s “unfair” that she has her opinions of sex and that your “high libido” means she’s supposed to disregard them

Leave this poor girl alone. Even if she says yes, she can’t trust you, and you’re probably just going to dick her over again. Your idea of her being a good girlfriend was “she let me do what I want.” You have no respect for this girl whatsoever. Let her go and if you’ve “grown up” like you say you have, don’t treat the next person you find so poorly. "
aqtvx6,NTA you need to talk about this with her and decide if it’s a good time for you guys to be in a relationship. it sounds like you want more than she can give right now focusing on her studies.

aqv3v2,"ESH but only a little. I think this was just a big misunderstanding. You wanted to play a 20 minute game and she wanted attention, both a-okay. However, it is Valentine's day and she was obviously having a bad day, you should have made her your priority. However, it was a 20 minute game and you reached out afterward. Her getting upset, not calling back, and ruining the plans is all, ultimately, her fault for not being able to calm down and communicate."
aqv3vl,"NAH You break up with someone when you realize you no longer want to be with them.

aqv7f4,ESH. It was a rude comment. You shouldn’t have said anything if you didn’t know how she’d take it. Her response does seem over the top though.
aqv9xh,"ESH.

I don't think you're the biggest asshole in the world. But, taking crass potshots to everyone equally isn't the best way forward.

>I'm jealous your cat can just get away from you like that

I don't think that's funny enough or witty enough to be excusable to say to a non-close friend. *Especially* since you already know she's more sensitive than other people. I have cats, and if I were in her shoes and my closest friend said that to me then I'd be hurt. You're basically saying ""you're a shit person"". That isn't being 'rough around the edges', that's being a dick. Again, especially since you don't know her that well **and already know she's sensitive.** With my friend, he did things similar to you where he'd make jokes at my expense regularly, and it got to the point where I literally asked him to stop making fun of me, because it was wearing away at me.

However, she also sucks for saying:

>I look fat, joke I'm gonna die alone

especially when she dishes it out but can't take it herself. So yeah, you both kinda suck. Why don't you say you'll stop making fun of her and ask her to stop making fun of you? Direct all your negative energy/comments are your other friends instead."

aqwezg,"NTA. Youre not obligated to pursue or maintain a positive relationship with her. It's honestly up to you if you want to change the relationship.  It didn't sound like shes changed or regrets her behavior, though.  More like she found a new target after you stoped taking it laying down. "
aqwgli,"NTA. He is an asshole for moving the date if it was done so your family wouldn't get visited, but I think a lot of that comes from your parents enabling a narcissist. Until they step up, and give consequences, like not going to the wedding, he will continue to pull this shit. The fact that as soon as you started pointing out how he needed to make a change rather than just giving him attention and commiserating his misery he moved on point to him being a narcissist. 

You will never be an asshole for taking a step back from a toxic person."
aqwgtf,"NTA, it's your birthday and you should get to choose who's coming over"
aqwieo,"NTA- You wouldn’t be the asshole for quitting your job after you discussed it with your superior. I’m not sure why your family reacted that way, so i think we’re missing a piece of the story. No one would react that way unless you told them something you didn’t say here. It seems crazy for your entire family to not trust you and say you’re an awful person for quitting your job in a calm and responsible manner. "
aqwjk2,"NAH.

You’ve never called her out on it I assume, so she might think you’re completely okay driving all the time. She’d be the asshole if you told her you want to drive alone and she kicks up a fuss.

No matter how silly or trivial the thing is, his refusal to listen to you is really his lack of respect of your personal boundaries. He's being the asshole, not you."
aqwktj,"YTA This is my hometown and the amount of people who complained about the alert is fucking absurd. It’s an inconvenience, sure, but it helped police catch the asshole who did it. There was a very real possibility it could have saved her life. And your complaint about your distance (98km) is made moot by the fact that she was found over 100km away. They alert the reasonable radius that could potentially find her. I’d rather my night sleep ruined than disable these incredibly necessary alerts."
aqwvr0,"NAH - you had a common and valid fear response of freezing. Thankfully others were able to step up. If anything now may be a good time (as it seems you're doing) to reflect on other ways you could react in the future. Maybe not physically intervening, but loudly calling the cops, or maybe taking out your phone and visibly start recording the incident and loudly calling out the inappropriate behavior. Not everyone is capable of physically intervening, but there are other ways of offering help. "
aqwvxg,"YTA Because it sounds like it's been multiple times you have relied on others. I've known men who carry around tampons just because they want to be able to help their friends in a pinch. Helping friends shouldn't be a direct you helped me X times so I'll help you X times sort of thing, but you shouldn't always be the one getting helped. So, I do think you should start carrying around non-prescription pain killers as a way to pay back those who have helped you and encourage a generally helpful environment where your friends know that even if they slip up now and then their friends have their backs."
aqww5x,"NAH why inject yourself in to a situation that is not your concern? You arent a parent teaching children how to behave, Dave and Guy need to work out their issues for themselves. If things are awkward and your friend says to you ""why are things awkward' then you can say ""you owe him an apology"" "

You don't have to make the coffee, especially if you don't drink it. Lighten up buddy, this is a very very small thing. It sounds like you might have a lot of anxiety, you can always dm me if you wanna talk."
aqwzs1,"NTA It is disrespectful to not inform you that he was cancelling. His time is so important he can't even take a few minutes to let you know, but your time is worth so little that you are kept waiting in a holding pattern expecting him to come and not getting involved in anything time-consuming. That's not a good attitude to start a relationship with. Besides, even if he weren't an asshole at all, you still wouldn't owe him a date simply because you don't want to date him."

You're teaching your kid a lesson when you do something like this, but not the one you think you are."
aqz21j,"NTA

I think one important detail here is the fact that when you woke up Ben was already watching Jenny. To me this indicates that it couldn't have been fully your responsibility to watch Jenny, otherwise someone would have woken you up to ask for help when your mom left.

I also understand why he got mad:  You seem entitled and materialistic.  But in reality (from your perspective) it's about the thought and the principle.

I think this kind of thing happens a lot in relationships...   It certainly happened early in my marriage.  You guys just need to communicate about your expectations and hopes for the holiday.  Once you've been married as long as I have, you probably won't give a shit about VDay."

YTA because she was on her phone for 5 minutes, and instead of bringing it up or asking her to stop, you made a vague passive aggressive comment and sulked.

If she's seriously going to terminate a relationship over a movie, one of two things is happening:

1) She's a little nuts.

2) You have a long history of doing what's best for you at her detriment and she's let it slide without saying anything and this was the straw that broke the camel's back.

ar0j18,"ESH

She's right, even if don't you have a radio you must have other devices in the house to listen to music/the radio to. I know you had a crap day, but your roommates shouldn't suffer because of it, so would it really have been that bad to let her watch her show? I suppose cooking dinner didn't take ages so you weren't in the kitchen that long anyway. Then again, you can livestream most TV shows these days via Internet, so she could easily have done that in her room. Or at least watch the episode online the next day. The way she demanded to use the TV as if it was hers is kinda shitty too. So everyone sucks and it doesn't sound like a nice shared living situation you guys got there."

I'm sorry to tell you that because it does seem you made some attempt, but aside from the cupcake carrier, your gifts were essentially leftovers, which in turn made *her* feel like a leftover -- cold and unwanted. 

I believe you when you say you were devastated, and you do seem to care about her, but the key to your post was the second-to-last paragraph when you disclosed that you'd just had a fight over a lack of intimacy from you. Your gifts suggested that that discussion/fight had no impact because your gifts were anything but intimate. She expressed how she felt, and you ""didn't say anything"" on the way to dinner, by your own words. Intimacy means telling her how you feel. Does she know you felt devastated by the criticism? Being open about those feelings in the moment is what she was looking for and probably the reason she didn't drop the discussion -- she still had more she was hoping to discover from you. 

Letting her in on those thoughts is probably a greater gift to her than anything you could offer. "
ar0oc2,"YTA for giving him shit - however...

This seems to be a regional difference here in the US. I grew up in the Northeast and if you brought a bottle to a party (of wine or liquor), you left it at the party. That’s how most of us built our liquor cabinets. 

Here in the Northwest, I was mortified when my husband packed up the bourbon we brought with us. He was confused, because that’s what everyone did. At another outing, a mutual friend told the party host “Oh, I left my Chambord at your house. I will pick it up next time I go over.” I explained how embarrassed I’d been by my husband and they thought it was hilarious! Now, every time I go to a party at that friend’s house, she packs a bag of stuff for me to take home. "

People can put up with some major disabilities in a partner... unless their partner isn't even trying. And it sounds a lot like you're at that point. But beyond that, what do you want in a relationship? Maybe he's a great guy doing his best, but if he can't give you what you want in a relationship, then this isn't going to work. You shouldn't be with him out of obligation or pity. It doesn't sound like he makes you happy."

NTA (and she is!)

>Now since she came here for me and left the states willingly. **It’s hard for me to say anything to her without her bringing up the move to Mexico and holding it over my head.** We were both very young when we married and had kids and she never got to experience night life as she would want to.

She is holding a decision you two made together against you. Just because she has the opportunity to escape doesn't mean she suddenly has no responsibilities.

>Now I’m definitely jealous that she gets to take all of these trips and leave her responsibilities behind. But I don’t know if that’s the issue, it bothers me more that she seems to enjoy leaving the responsibly of a family behind. **She avoids calling the kids** because it upsets her so we really only talk at night.

She has guilt for what she is doing because she knows she isn't trying her hardest to be a good mother. This guilt causes her to hide and pretend as if she doesn't have kids.

> **She says she staying in but the he next morning you can tell she’s hungover or one of her coworkers spilled the beans on social media.**

And she lies about her night time habits! **Huge red flags, OP.**

> My question: AITH if I ask her to slow down on the traveling? **It’s not really a requirement for her but she goes to ensure that her team is presenting our product properly.** I love that she’s so driven and successful but it’s really starting to wear me down. I catch myself taking my frustration out on the kids when that should never happen. 

She is clearly using work as a convenient excuse to run away from her commitments and responsibilities. You told her to stay in the US a long time ago and she insisted on coming with you to Mexico. This showed that she was commiting to a life with you and whatever that entails. If she wants something different now, she can't have her cake and eat it too. She has one foot out and one foot in. She needs to make a decision so that the responsibilities you two have can be divided up evenly again. If she is no longer committed to you, you are no longer required to take on more than you can chew.

You need to sit her down and lay it all out. This is, at least partially, on you for not calling out the red flags as they have popped up. It is time to put an end to this, one way or another. 

I'm sorry that you are going through this, and I wish you good luck in the future.

I kind of get where she's coming from. A lot of women's ""advantages"" are kind of shitty compared to men's ""advantages,"" and when you're having a feminism-charged conversation shit like ""BUT YOU GET FREE DRINKS"" or ""YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR DINNER"" gets brought up a lot as ""counterpoints"" to the wage gap and all the other sexist shit that goes on. So. I get the point she's trying to make: Yes, each gender has its claim to advantages, but male advantages are vastly superior and women would trade free drinks and free meals for a higher salary and a lower likelihood of being sexually assaulted in a heartbeat, if they could. Just to put that out there.

That being said, she sounds like an asshole. Not for her beliefs, which I think are valid, but the angry spittle-spraying way she's expressing them. Perfect example of when feminism becomes frustrating for everyone (including feminists)."

But...if you do want to help your friend, know that the best way to help someone in an abusive/controlling relationship is usually not to call out what's happening - as weird as that sounds. Interventions may look good  on tv but they are not recommend by experts for these situations. As occurred, she is likely to deny, and slowly lose contact with friends. And isolation feeds into the controlling relationships and makes it more likely she will stay with him. The best way to help is just to keep being there, a person she can turn to once she's ready."

ariii3,"YTA. You moved out. It’s unreasonable for the space to stay empty when you’re gone most of the year, and since the next reasonable step was for your brother to move into it, and he did, that makes it his room. 

You’re now kicking him out of his bed in his room and expecting him to be happy to leave it. YTA."
arijre,"You're not an asshole. Your friend is. ""Bright colours look good on people with darker skin"" is in no way a racist statement. He's making something out of that that isn't there."
ariox4,"NAH - I think your grandparents probably got them with the best of intentions, knowing how much you adore your shoes. there's probably not much to it other than that. However, your feelings are your feelings, but you managed them maturely, took yourself away while you composed yourself and then carried on with your day.

Nobody's an asshole for having feelings about something, it's how you express them/ treat other people as a result of them that's important."
arip0j,"YTA

> I told her to take as long as she needed

>  She is calling me unreasonable for not letting her stay tonight

She's calling you unreasonable because you ARE being unreasonable. Then you're blaming her for your mental health issues? It's not her fault you've been hospitalized 7 times in 6 years, and if it is somehow then why are you still talking to her? The more you added the worse it got. ""She has no mental health issues why is she mad I just kicked her out with no notice??"". I understand why she wanted to move out ASAP

edit: YT massive A"
ariqq8,NTA - It's your ex. I wouldn't expect you or anyone to be looking forward to spending time with them. 
arir07,"NAH I think you have different experiences. It seems that he can easily distance himself from the problems with the meme or his friends' rhetoric and enjoy the joke, while you can't. It'd have been nice if he understood how you felt, but you didn't really communicate that very well

&#x200B;

As for the comments themselves, you were 100% right to bail out. One, because if they don't want to listen and are just there to troll, they are not worth engaging with. Two, and this might sound harsh, but you don't seem to be able to articulate a good argument even if they did"
aris52,"NTA. I sympathized up until you mentioned your mother committing suicide because she's being bothered. I mean, what the actual hell is that? Besides, of course, some kind of personality disorder.
Your mom is obsessed with an app. It doesn't matter how great she can sing, even Whitney Houston had to take care of her kids. This is unsettling. You need to have a real, honest discussion with your father, he needs to take this more seriously before your family deteriorates any more than it has. Over an app."
aritxd,"NTA, you as a child don't have any obligation to feed your brother, your mother is the asshole for being pissed at you. Depending on how old your brother is, he might be an asshole too."
ariw8c,"NTA. She fucked the whole situation up. And she more than likely knows this but is just embarrassed. 

I would just leave and move on personally. A few things here that would have annoyed me a lot.

I don’t judge people who get wasted or drink and I have on occasion done this, but who the hell cannot just keep there shit together for one night. 

Secondly texting you whilst you are next to them that she wants you to leave is so immature. 

Sounds like you will be better off without her. Good Luck "
arj04v,"NTA. a prenup gets a bad rep for being onesided. In reality, it's a good way to agree on how things will be split in the event of a divorce.

So long as you don't try to make it all about you, a prenup is fine.

With all that said, I think you know where things are going...."
arj1vh,"NTA considering like 99% of people kick their partners out when they find out they’ve been cheating. And that’s what this was. Absolutely cheating. Y’all agreed to be monogamous and he went behind your back. You had every right to kick him out, esp when he’s living off of you entirely it sounds like while lying to you and going behind your back. Add to that that, as in all cases of cheating, if he did have sex with other women, you now have to weigh the chance that he didn’t use protection and could’ve caught something and then passed it onto you. So not only did he lie to you and use you and cheat on you, he potentially put your health at risk. Fuck him. You absolutely should’ve kicked his ass to the curb. He deserved to be kicked out and you did nothing wrong. "
arj37p,"Nta. If they want to ruin their own lives, they're adults and that's they're own prerogative. But you shouldn't get in the middle. You have tried to guide them out of the bad situations but it's not working, so the best you can do is take care of yourself. Try moving in with other family or friends, or living on your own. But it's obvious both of your parents are toxic and never going to change, so its either you deal with them for the rest of your life because you're afraid to lose them or you try to salvage your own life and risk losing them in the process. "
arj7tw,"NTA, just awkward. 

We’re not really all as casual about the word cunt as we seem in the internet or in foreign bars. Aussies in general enjoy the meme though, so feed into a lot of bullshit. (See drop bears)

Your approach was infinitely better than the occasional one who will just call you a cunt immediately because you’re Australian. 
"
arj86j,"NTA. But only because it’s natural to be frustrated under the circumstances. Now if your start taking your frustrations out on her, then you’d be the asshole. Kids that age are exhausting and thus her immune system is probably having a tough time. No doubt the five year old is bringing in all sorts of germs from preschool too. "
arj9z4,"NAH - telephone phobia is a real thing and I know a lot of people (including myself) that do suffer with it or have in the past. It seems like a simple thing to pick up the phone but she will overthink it to the point that she is unable to do it.

Having said that, forcing herself to do it is a way to help her overcome her fear. I was terrified and then I got a job where I had to talk over the phone on a daily basis, I'm fine at work but still ask my boyfriend to make calls outside of work because I'm too anxious to do so.

It's not wrong for you to be frustrated with her for putting it on you, especially as you have a busy schedule. She probably feels awful for asking you to do it for her as it is."
arjcvb,"NTA, I’d suggest just demanding full custody straight away, it obviously seems he doesn’t want to be a father.

But that child’s a lifesaver by letting you find them emails.

Good luck."
arjgxq,"It's kinda hard to tell without more info but sounds like YTA? You haven't hung out much with your boyfriend romantically for a while due to psych issues, and then immediately binge on this new person you met? It's pretty easy to see why he'd be hurt."
arjld4,Anyone else not buying this story?
arjoj2,"NTA. You told her to stop multiple times and she didn’t listen. 

Edit: are you sure she doesn’t like you and she’s putting this on as a front? "
arjppj,NAH but doesn’t stop you either buying something too or getting him some wine or beer to say thank you. 
ark2vj,"INFO..... Why are you treating your ex like she is still your girlfriend?

When you became ex's it was time her to organize her own care, and you to enjoy your holiday....

I'd say NTA. "
ark34j,"NAH, but just because you're not an asshole doesn't mean you're not annoying. The school is within their right to ban you from using the computers if you're sharing stupid shit to people who don't want it. They wouldn't pick up on it just by chance, something would've triggered their reporting system or someone reported it to them."
ark62e,"NTA, your house, your rules. 

Your sister is pretty presumptuous to invite 50 people over to **your** house and pretty bold to call you an asshole when the recipient of 50 unwanted people says no."
ark81i,"NTA. It’s her responsibility to figure out her transport, not yours. Doesn’t matter if you use your car one day a week or seven. It’s not *her* car. I would already set the boundary of: “if your car is in the shop for more than a week and/or dies completely, you need an alternative because you won’t be using my vehicle.” "
ark8hr,NTA my bed is sacred if a random person slept in it id be fucking pissed but making them buy new sheets may be a tad overboard. Then again its your bed so u make the choice.
arkbyr,"I don’t know how to call this one because it seems like you were trying to get out of this since the beginning because your fiancé wasn’t supposed to attend. The snow just seems like the excuse she needed to not let you, I get some kind of vibe here that you do what she says regardless. I understand it’s her car, but living in an area that snows regularly it doesn’t make a lot of sense to not have a vehicle in which you can’t drive safely in the snow. 

I’m going NAH because you’re friend didn’t do anything wrong and was rightfully disappointed. You did attempt to tell him you weren’t going but at the very last minute. I see why he reacted that way. Please feel free to clarify if I’m misunderstanding you. "
arke1o,🤔 I pick the window seat so I can control the window. I close it if its sleeping aka night. But I like to look outside whenever. During daylight its open. I suggest you pick your seat wisely. 
arkeat,NTA. Your points are very valid. I wouldn't want any association with that person whole blood half blood quarter blood any blood. Just let him be and if the nieces want contact cool. If not well meh whatevs. 
arkfm4,"NTA. That is completely messed up of the company to require a phone bil after having acquired so much else. I honestly feel like its heading towards a bit of a scam, especially if they wont tell you what they need it for"
arkj48,"NTA. And depending on where you live, the medical professionals who give that info out are in a whole lot of trouble. "
arkl84,"NTA

She's not ""voicing her opinion"". She's shitting all over you for no reason, probably because she's stressed or unhappy about something else.

Take a step back and think. This is a parent telling her child not to take an internship that could help his career and not to take the medicine that doctors have prescribed to him. That's fucked, top to bottom. Parents are supposed to support their kids, not undermine them!"
arknss,"NTA, don't see why everyone on this thread thinks that you have to invite her. Your wedding, your choice. +1's are not a mandatory rule for weddings"
arkriu,[deleted]
arksev,"NTA

She doesn't want you to spend time with your family so that you can ""be with her""? On your Dad's birthday? You were gone for one night!

That's crazy. That's totally fucking crazy.

Has she been controlling like this before?"
arl0uv,Do you tip in the supermarket? 
arl1bk,You're the false advertising arsehole here. No photo at all equals lazy but photo of something else equals dishonest. Give this woman her money back. 
arl1nw,YTA. Don’t leverage her property to control her actions.
arl1wp,NTA check out r/raisedbynarcissists
arl2rt,"YTA. 

Presumably you need a car to get to/from work. Without that offer of the Jeep you won't be able to get to and from your job as easily. 

So either decline the offer and go without a car or accept the offer as is. 

They seem like really supportive parents and they'll likely help you out with bills if it comes to that, but you can't go negotiating someone's good will. "
arl3k2,"NTA in the slightest. You would he if you treated them differently. 

First thing I'd do is take that damn phone away from him. No six year old in the history of mankind needed to have a phone, whether it's only for games or not. "
arl4oi,"NTA- she shouldn’t bring it home if it bothers her that much. That being said- all these comments about how “you can cook whatever whenever because you live there” are clearly from people who either haven’t lived with a SO or are assholes themselves. There’s a level of respect when you live with someone you care about. The smell of fish makes me absolutely sick and while my husband likes eating fish, he would never dream of cooking it in our home. "
arl8ml,"NTA, you weren't driving and you didn't tell him to speed up. Even if you did, he's the one driving. Don't pay him anything."
arlcsz,NTA. You double checked with her so it wasn’t your fault 
arld58,"NTA, i would almost say nah but calling you a weirdo ain't cool.





I personally wouldn't confront them, but i feel it woulda been better to wait and see if you see them talking about you with your own eyes before confronting them, that may just be me though."
arljs4,NTA- you're an adult and can make your own choices. It sounds like your mom isnt respectful of what you want on your birthday so why shouldn't you go and do your own thing that you'll actually enjoy. 
arlk60,"Thank you for the update! I'm glad to hear that you've reached a decision and frankly, it sounds like the best you can do in the circumstances. You, your girlfriend, and your wife all deserve to be happy. I'm also a lesbian dating a transgender woman, so while we're not exactly in the same situation, I feel you and I'm happy for you. Best of luck with coming out -- stay safe, above all -- and thanks for sharing your story on here."
arls97,NTA - both have agreed!
arlt1k,"NTA

Me and my gf barely post about each other. We don’t need to prove our love to anyone but each other. And the same for you guys. "
arm085,"NTA. Guy needs help, have you tried contacting authorities for him? It might get him into state custody so someone can take care of him and help him get better. But anyways, the way I see it, if he isn’t doing his job and is actually harming the server, then he shouldn’t be doing the job. "
arm12v,"NTA: allowing him to continue behaving as he is just encourages him. You have no obligation to include him or anything, no matter how sad his life story is - if he's obnoxious you don't have to hang around with him."
arm342,"NTA Doing favors for a friend is normal, but this does sound excessive to the point it is hurting him. But that's his business, and he clearly wants you to stay out of it. So, the only thing you can do is say no when he tries to make it your business. Next time, don't do favors for your brother for her. I mean, it's nice to help others, but you need to keep it at the level that others aren't thinking you forgot to put on your oxygen mask first."
arm3bh,NTA But I feel like you need legal advice on the consequences rather than asshole advice on the ethics.
arm8w6,"NTA.  You’re an idiot if you don’t drop her.  The second you make a mistake because you don’t know what you don’t know, you risk liability.  

Stop playing realtor and drop the lady.   Make detailed proposals for future clients explaining what you will do for them.  Reference your agreed upon proposal anytime they ask for something that goes above and beyond.  "
arm9k9,"NTA. She doesn’t have time to clean up after herself at the end of her day, but you’re expected to at the end your day? No thank you. That’s a problem. 

Maybe see if she can pick up just one chore for now? Not that it should be difficult to do them all anyway, but if she can’t commit to just one then you have a serious issue. "
arm9tq,"NTA Dying doesn't suddenly make every bad thing you did go away. If you want to be surrounded by loved ones when you are old and dying, you need to be loving enough that they will love you. It's sad, but it's not your fault that she didn't do that."
arm9vf,"NAH But as an adult, sometimes you make decisions you decide are right for you despite the way others aren't going to like it, and you have to own that. So, yeah, maybe your family will feel hurt, and you took that into consideration when you eloped and decided you were okay with that, so it's time to live with that choice. But it was your choice to make. Congrats on getting married, by the way."
armc1t,"NTA, maybe you can repurpose it or give it to someone who might have a better use for it. Sorry that your nan is being rude about this. "
armf9j,"NTA. New student means you probably live on campus, right? Your RA would definitely take your side on this if you approached them calmy and help you make a plan of action here."
armg1t,"NAH I think it's right that you have let him know that he is having such a shitty behaveiour, but sometimes people like him are just extremely anxious or even depressed. I think he needs some serious help"
armhc0,NTA but sounds like you should talk to your BF about sharing so much with his mom. Correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t seem like you were planning on telling his mom while you were in Puerto Rico? Seems like you two could benefit from a unified public relations front 
armv0e,"NAH She is allowed to ask, and you are allowed to say no. This is a very personal choice, and it is fully your choice to make."

However, you WBTA if you do tell the world about it against your girlfriend's wishes. Let her be in control of the situation and perhaps come to a compromise. Most importantly, don't break her trust in you. I'm going to guess that it's likely the progress in healing has regressed and gone down the drain by this... situation (for lack of a more appropriate descriptor).

Edit: spelling"
arnn7m,YTA. You’re not with him. You’re not paying for it. Stop using his shit. You wouldn’t walk into his house and take food out of his fridge. You wouldn’t swipe his keys and take his car on a joyride. This is no different.
arnx3k,"NTA

Having kids is a huge responsibility. You can have kids only when you want and only when you are sure that you can afford them a quality life.

They're not little kids anymore. IMO, they're old enough to have electronics. If you think they'll start slipping in school, wouldn't you want them to be able to use their phones outside of school so they don't use them in school? I'm sure you can find some common ground where you let them have them after all of their homework is done or setting time limits (there's plenty of ways to automatically set up parental controls like that)."

arpguu,"NAH/ESH you need to learn to set expectations better so you're not silently expecting something and then getting mad that she didn't do what you wanted. She needs to learn to validate your hurt feelings. There is no asshole for the breakup. She doesn't want the emotional burden of taking care of another person's feelings right now in her life and it's nothing personal against you. You do seem kinda needy tbh, facetiming someone in the middle of their workday when you know they're busy and stressed, and I can see how it can seem like you call her on your own terms and you end the conversation on your own terms and she doesn't get a say in how the phone call goes.

Then, if boss still does nothing, document what you can and have a meeting or something more professional with the bosses boss. It’s annoying to have to go up chain of command, but you probably wouldn’t be seen as a snitch if it was done this way and it gives your boss one last professional opportunity to do his damn job. 

So...sorry but because it was a picture just sent to the bosses boss.... YTA. 

Although I totally get it and have been in your shoes before except the next level up STILL did nothing. I hope it starts to get easier for you. "

arq59i,"NAH

Sounds like she isn't ready to date again after her loss. 

Have a serious conversation about the topic and tell her how you feel. That's very important, it's about your feelings. Never, ever say something like ""I want you to throw his picture away.""

I guess this is more relevant for /r/Advice or /r/relationships"
arq8na,NTA. Honestly I find it really horrific that the counselor is reinforcing her codependency instead of trying to help her find coping mechanisms. It is not yours or your sisters responsibility to “save” your mom.

""Sorry dad, I wont be doing that. Is there anything else I can help you with?""

arrs70,NTA. It’s perfectly okay to feel nothing about this kind of situation. 
arrsyq,"NAH, you sound super insecure. And I get that. But you should know that when he said it doesn't mean anything, it doesn't. Men are super visual. Now, if it's excessive, then yeah, ask him to tone it down. Otherwise, don't take it personally and know your self-worth! He's with you for a reason!"

arrvps,"NAH

Child therapist here. I feel it’s perfectly healthy to discuss the topic of suicide with a five year old as long as the child initiates the conversation. I think your wife asking how she would do it is fine, because then y’all can take precautions against that (I.e. hiding knives, locking windows, if she still takes baths she should be monitored by your wife). Secondly I would look into what could be causing these feelings. Are you and your wife fighting? Is she getting picked on by friends or at school/daycare? Is there potentially any abuse going on outside of the home? (god forbid). Thirdly I would recommend starting early in her that there can be alternatives to negative feelings. Scribbling really hard on paper can be good, so can going on walks with mom and dad. 

TL;DR: there should be communication between you and your wife about how to go about this, but at the end of the day the top priority is getting to the root of why she feels this way. Although it’s not super uncommon for suicidal thoughts to come on to young kids since they’re just about at that age learning about death, it’s not normal and it’s certainly not healthy. "
arrz10,"YTA--- if you wanted to be able to smoke weed without being an asshole, you should've never promised her you wouldn't"
ars17v,"NTA, just like with a house...your baby, your rules. 

If they don't like it they can be as put-off as much as they want. "
ars72w,"NTA, at all.  Your dad sounds like a total uncaring douchebag. 

To not have any remorse, except for possibly being caught, is mindboggling and to say those callous words is just total assholery.

Just because he donated sperm doesn't mean you are obligated to keep toxic people in your life. "

If you really can’t afford it, you need to decide between dealing with the extra cost or just waiting longer until you can afford to visit, and she should understand if her financials are equally tight. She becomes TA if you explain why you can’t afford it (and have to postpone it) and she still complains, and you become TA when you demand she pays. "
artrjw,[deleted]
artuyk,NTA Trust your instincts. 
aru0cj,NTA. Your dad isn’t borderline abusive. He is straight up abusive. His sexual comments and unwanted contact is truly sick and in no way a normal interaction between father and daughter. You deserve so much better from your parents and I’m so sorry you didn’t get it. 
aru0s8,"NTA. I just skimmed this but

This your wedding. Not your dad’s. It’s not his business who you invite and is overstepping just giving you a list of people. 

You also have full reins of who comes or not. Some people may get their feelings hurt. But that is 100% not your problem. 

I’m not engaged, but when I do get engaged, I have a full plan of inviting only the people I see on a regular basis. Also not allowing kids at my wedding, regardless of who they are. Will this piss people off? Sure. Do I care? Nope. Because it isn’t about them. 

Your wedding is for you to spend the day with your loved ones and soon to be spouse. That’s all and if the people who weren’t invited can’t see that, piss on them. "

aru45y,"NTA

I was on the fence until you said this is a frequent thing and she's uninsured. You didn't go out of your way to call her a liar or say no. Trying to confirm with a hypochondriac that it's actually a medical emergency before they spend a lot of money on uninsured healthcare is frankly a kindness. "
arua0y,"NTA, he is if hes really pushing it. I think you 2 are not sexually compatible, its only going to get worse. "
arud8g,"NTA. He was being disrespectful, though shouting may not have been the right answer. Honestly, if they really can’t help from butting in, you should play in a different room from them, or not play around them in general. If they already don’t respect that you want a fair game, it doesn’t seem like much else is going to change their minds. At the same time, it did get them to leave, so I won’t say it was totally unwarranted, probably just not the most ideal solution since it is rudeness in response to rudeness."
aruerk,[deleted]
aruhle,"Sacrificing familial and friend connections for a miniscule chance of success sounds like toxic behavior to me. :P

He's eleven anyways, every kid has the dream of making money playing video games. I can't say I wouldn't be the same if I grew up around streamers (I'd do it now too tbf). It's just something you should grow out of sooner rather than later unless you've got something special. Being good at shooting in Fortnite means nothing when millions of others can do it too."
arun8w,"NAH yet. How was he to know he shouldn't proceed? You bought it for him.  This wasn't an affair.  The masseuse was working. They have no relationship.  He didn't sneak around. So you both got more than you bargained for.  Lesson learned. You WILL be the asshole if you can't get passed this, and return to regular physical intimacy with your husband. Good luck. "
aruoqz,"NTA

Why does she care if you salt your food? Everyone has different preferences."
aruqj6,"NTA

And yes, your sister IS crazy. Talking shit about a fricking baby's appearance is crazy. It sounds like she's jealous of attention the other new moms might be getting."
aruqmu,NTA. Your card. You're good. 
aruqte,"NTA. 

But I’d sit her down and explain that this is not a phase, this is who you are and you will no longer respond to her or interact her until she calls you by your preferred name and pronoun.  If she comes around then great!  But if not ignore with no regrets."
aruxhy,"NAH.  I didn't have a cellphone until I was 17 and could buy my own.  I don't think it's a parent's responsibility to give their children one.  Sure, it's nice to have in emergencies, but most people have one you can use and I bet GMA has a landline.  I understand why she wants one.  I just don't think they're necessary.  Too many kids are using them inappropriately. "
aruxp8,"NTA - your mom definitely is though. Who in the right mind even thinks about saying that when they see their child crying. It's not like you made a scene or anything, you just showed a bit of emotion. You are doing really well treating your mother (better than most people I know) but what she did is way out of line."
arv0te,NTA - Your sister is incredibly bossy and unreasonable. She should just ask a neighbour who doesn't have to make a huge detour to feed the cats. She should ask nicely though. 
arv1le,NTA. I don’t ever plan on having my SO watch me shit. Why is that something he wants to do?? I think it’s extremely normal to want privacy while using the bathroom. I can’t believe I just typed that sentence. Is this even real?? 
arvc9a,"NTA

Don't light yourself on fire to warm up somebody else."
arvdch,"YTA in this situation, if I'm reading this right.  The other issues aside, you should still thank people when they do favors for you.  Especially if those are massive favors.  While you personally might not care about being thanked, that doesn't hold true for everyone.  Even if you guys live in the same culture.  Even if it is only partially done.  

For some reason I feel like something about your behavior was off-putting, to them, and it made them feel like you just didn't like them around even though they were helping as their immediate quitting seems a bit random.  I'm not sure.  This one is hard to judge exactly without seeing more of both sides."
arvp6r,"NTA It sounds like youre in college so everyone should be old enough to be on time without being told. People who are late suck.

That being said youre pretty much a nerdy snitch so be prepared for wedgies, ya nerd. "
arvpoi,"YTA.

What's more important, being right or being kind to your grandparents? Respect your elders, even if they're being stupid. "
arvu90,"NTA. I'm really sorry to say this, but it does sound like she is using you for her own convenience.  I get that she might not be prepared to stand up to her boyfriend about you, but she's only with you when she wants or needs something."
arvxwd,"NTA 

Unless he had a valid physical/emotional reason, he has no right to take credit for work that isn't his. In fact, he should honestly take it as a learning experience to improve his work ethic.

Trust me, if he's really a ""good guy"", he'll understand why you did what you did"
arw4rs,"NTA.  Picking a dress for you without asking, the jab at your weight, and it sounds like she regularly tries to steamroll people.  She sounds terrible.  

I think though that your best path forward though is just to stop antagonizing her.  You don't have to like her but at least try to be civil while also minimizing contact as much as possible.  

It is a bit of a hard call because they *are* paying for the dress, but ultimately because her intentions are definitely not good that you aren't the asshole here. "
arw5t6,NTA. She won't change though. Make arrangements to secure another rental ASAP and bail. 
arw625,"NAH. She almost certainly doesn't realise how irritating this is and is just trying to share her excitement. The only way to stop it is to tell her. She'll be upset but if she has any sense she'll come around and understand that if she wants to have real mutual friendships, she's going to have to strike a balance. Obviously she can talk about it sometimes, she just needs to be considerate of other people's interests and try and stay on topic in conversations. 

I'd suggest inviting her for a coffee and explaining this kindly to her. That you love her but you need a break from DND stuff sometimes, and that you're telling her now because you don't want it to become a situation where she ends up left out of things because people feel frustrated with her. "
arw6un,NTA. They could have used ... the lock.
arwelz,"NTA - For me, you judged her because of HOW she acts, not on WHAT (believes) she acts."
arwvcn,"NTA. You don't need to keep people who put you down, badmouth you and don't care about you in your life. You owe them nothing. "
arwxsm,"YTA, Shes not trying to control you dude, she just wants the respect and security that she's the only one you're thinking about. Jesus christ if I was with someone who refused to get rid of the nude pics from exes for any reason, would be grounds for suspicion. This is bordering on Shitpost material."
arx35q,"NTA- he caught feelings, didn't want to admit it, and now resents you for not feeling the same way after sleeping together."
arx3m3,"NAH

As a woman who has flat shared, I know this vibe. You’re in a situation where you’re having to share a space with someone and you feel uncomfortable. Sure, maybe it’s because of unconscious biases around age and gender, but also living with someone who makes you feel uncomfortable is a bit of a shit show. 

Living with older people when you’re in your 20s can be weird, My sister had a flat mate in his 40s who had children her age and it was a recipe for disaster: he took on a parental role that was deeply inappropriate and made her feel she couldn’t have boyfriends round or experiment in the kitchen without this dudes permission. Having a child the same age as your flat mates is an awkward one...

Saying that, did you tell your roommate you had specifications when he started looking? Could you consider pitching in to help find more suitable replacements? I think knocking him back and then holding your roommate to the lease would make YTA for sure, so if you need to take control of what happens next. "
arx4wn,NTA. Your girlfriend sounds unstable. That’s your real problem. Good luck. 
arxc8u,"NTA dude, as much as people will pressure you to talk to him you don't owe anyone shit and you're not obligated to talk to anyone you don't want to, especially considering what that guy has put you through. in no world are you an asshole for going no contact with this dude, there's no good reason to ever talk to him again. i don't see why the rest of your family would try to convince you to talk to him given the circumstances but it's not right if them to try and sweep his bs under the rug. "
arxe2f,"NTA, unless you did make her think you were dating her while flirting. Was there ever a time that you said something to make her think that??

 I think she probably just got jealous and blew it out of proportion. Involving her friends in her text marathon adds to my theory that she blew it out of proportion. "
arxlll,YTA. You’re not old enough to drink and you stole from your brother. Get your act together and be lucky that’s all he did.
arxm0s,[deleted]
arxmtk,"NTA for caring about the dog, but it really isn’t your decision to make. She’s not your girlfriend, you don’t live together, and you can’t keep the dog - sounds like her decision has been made. "
arxpbm,"NTA, what you did was appropriate. If it went on any longer I may have pulled into a business or gas station (if possible) just to get away from these douchebags."
arxpqg,"YTA for making a diss track about someone being gay. Seriously, it's 2019."
arxvhe,"NTA.

You don't owe the company anything, don't pass on a great opportunity because it might not come around again.

Also the way they fired your colleague, who's to say they won't do that to you? "
arxxnc,"NTA.

It's your body. It's your choice whether or not you want to go through with donating an organ. You were right that you were not in the best state of mind to discuss this, and you were also right to consider the physical and financial ramifications of organ donation. Despite being tipsy/high, it seems like you handled the situation well.

Kinda weird that they were going to offer you so much money. I wonder if they understood it would take a financial toll on you, or if they wanted to bribe you into saying yes."
ary46j,Youd be the asshole for not doing what's good for the baby 
ary6qg,NTA. I feel like you've established the precedent that you're taking turns paying for meals that you have *together*. Her having a meal without you and then asking you to pay for it is kind of a dick move.  I'll be interested to know what happens when you ask her to pay for your next joint meal.
ary6r6,"NAH

But really an unnecessary post, you should've head onto r/Offmychest

Their relationship and their level of intimacy is really nothing you should be concerned about or even focused on. Focus on your wife and your kid, so what if they're nuzzlin' and cuddlin', don't matter, let it go.

And there wasn't any interaction as you stated, you didn't say a word, and you really are allowed to have your opinions on things like these, Just don't let it get to your head.


Take care, and enjoy future dinners with your family!"
aryask,NTA. Chiropractors are NOT doctors and it sounds like he’s trying to represent him as one. Most chiros try to practice way out of their scope of knowledge and lots are into alternative medicine and antivax. 
aryj0y,"NTA, obviously they were both not in a clear state of mind, and knowing your friend's history I think you made the right move."
aryk8v,"ESH. Her and your roommate suck for taking advantage of everyone else in the house and potentially racking up even more in utilities (if you pay utilities) and disrupting others with noise.

You suck because it’s been TWO FUCKING YEARS and you apparently haven’t confronted them, instead coming to the internet. Talk to your roommate or talk to them together but you can’t continue on with this shit "
arylc0,"NTA, his unfortunate family situation doesn't give him a free pass to borrow money from people while frivolously spending on other expenses. It's up to you, but you are entirely justified in not helping him."
aryrdq,"NAH    - *edited from YTA*

Are you saying you don't feel loved enough in this relationship, so you want something big for the ""milemarkers"" of your life to prove that it's all worth it? Cause I'll be honest, that's how I'm reading it.

Your boyfriend has been honest, he just wasn't raised that way. I can sympathize with him cause I too wasn't raised to celebrate every birthday or holiday. 

I'm now with an amazing woman who understands this. For our first vday I thought I put some good effort forward with some chocolate and stuffed animal. She got us a spa day. There's no comparison on who put in more effort. She didn't tell me she was dissapointed in me, just was happy for what she got.

When her mom had a birthday, the mother was salty that I didn't come over and celebrate (even though I don't like her and she's like 55). My gf backed me up then too. 

If these events are REALLY that important to you, find a boyfriend who will do that then. "
aryrpz,"YTA dude. 

It’s her brother.  Her parents aren’t coming so he is prob her only immediate family that will be at her wedding.  You’re such a huge asshole for picking a fight over this that I actually suspect this is a shit post.  Is anyone this dense? 

Your weird hang up about a dude in the bridal party (I noticed you didn’t ask him to be a groomsman, which was an option you know) is no where near as valid as your fiancée’s right to pick her own bridal party, and her right to have to brother is her wedding. 

You need to drop this and apologize instantly before your fiancée wises up and dumps you. "
aryrv8,"NAH. It seems like Mandy doesn't want to get to know you, which might make her TA. "
arysd8,"YTA.

that's creepy as fuck dude. Hand delivering flowers is bad enough, but opening a window and putting them in the house to find?!?!

That's some top tier weirdo behavior.

I blame romcoms for this behavior honestly. They've made people think this kind of behavior is endearing when it's not. It's creepy.

You're lucky they didnt put a restraining order on you."
arytq5,YTA. He was clearly already handling the situation. He wasn't hiding your existence or using her to inflate his own ego. He probably didn't tell you because he knew you would push the boundary. 
aryuhs,NTA people are ridiculous sometimes *shrug* sounds like you may have a bully on your team
aryuui,"NTA, and you're correct. Constantly feeling the need to ignore someone that is right there in front of you to interact with others on social media is the height of rudeness and shows a lot about how she feels about you and your relationship. "
aryv74,"NTA. Two months into dating and if you're having doubts, it's perfectly fine to break things off. Your advice was solid after all... If she isn't comfortable with men, why is she actively trying to date?"
arywys,NTA - he has a problem and his friends are Assholes next time leave him with them to take care of him for all the fun they had! 
aryz9u,NAH. The aid should have been doing their job and talked to you about how some autistic people have a rigid OCD that requires things like sitting in the same seat so they don’t have a meltdown. I’m going to assume you didn’t know this. It would suck to give up your seat but better than him throwing a full blown tantrum because he couldn’t stick to his routine.
arz15m,"NTA

Mom here. Feel free to PM me your report cards and I'll put them on my fridge. Send me your art and I'll make it my FB cover photo. Lmk if you're having the worst day ever and I'll make your favorite dinner and let you skip the dishes for tonight.

Life's hard. Your people should be helping you hang in there and there's nothing wrong with wanting that."
arz4da,"Personally, I’d say you’re NTA. Unfortunately, most people will encounter someone at some point in their lives who starts out as a great friend and things go sour. 

It’s definitely happened to me and if you’re having anxiety about his problems, that’s an issue. Yes, being a compassionate person is nice obviously, but you shouldn’t be experiencing anxiety over issues that aren’t directly yours to deal with. 

It might also be worth you seeing a therapist if you’re able to. Friends shouldn’t be an emotional or any other kind of burden. "
arz6qi,[deleted]
arz792,"You would NBTA by any stretch.

WF deserves to know what’s happening. You shouldn’t let his partner continue to take advantage of him nor lead him on. If you delay telling him, he’s only going to be more hurt when he finally does find out. "
arzbi4,"NTA

She's upset because she knows she did wrong, and it's easier to block you than admit it."
arzi2c,"YTA - as a general rule, don’t ever call a woman a blob. 
It’s true in *BoJack Horseman* and it’s true in life."
arzkgb,"NAH

Your mother wants you to have a strong cultural connection to your ancestry, which is important, but she probably can't understand the struggle you've dealt with having a ""unique"" name.

Could you compromise? Allow your mom to call you the original name as a ""nickname"", just between the two of you. It could be like a special title between mother and daughter.

Have you also thought of maybe bumping your original first name into another middle name? Sure, you'd have two middle names, but you'd kinda keep that connection with your mom"
arzmxo,[deleted]
arzotl,"NTA for telling it how it is, but you seem to care a lot for someone who appears to be a stranger/stalker. "
arzrqe,"NTA. You didn’t do anything wrong, and you definitely dodged a bullet there. He sounds manipulative, and I can see why you don’t want to tell him if he’s going to overreact in such a way. 
Is he actually a good friend? From what you’ve said, I’m curious to see if you get anything from the friendship. "
arztwc,[deleted]
arztzi,"NTA - she’s a grown ass woman who should have some concept of basic hygiene.  It’s antisocial to put others through her lack of hygiene, especially if she works etc.  I would say maybe wanting her to shave is more a personal choice and it’s up to her, but not bathing and smelling bad is absolutely not right "

as0lh8,"NTA--- personal hygiene is a matter of not only comfort, but the health of you and the people around you. It's unsanitary, and it sounds like you are offering him a free method of being clean. He needs to be grateful of your help and try to keep himself clean"

as1lpl,YTA in this case.  She's not wrong for not wanting to hand a phone back to someone who uses it while driving.  You didn't need the phone to be back in your pocket.  You could have asked her to put it there if you really wanted it there.
as1m24,"She probably is just craving some takeout food, and doesn’t have enough money for you both.

Edit: NAH"
as1np6,"NTA. No, you are not the asshole. Yes, it's nice to indulge your nephew in some co-op gaming sometimes. No, you do not have to waste all your time playing games with him. Your brother and wife are the classic ""not a gamer"" type where they're like ""eh you're relaxing with games anyway what's the difference?"" Just know he's a little kid and he's pretty much at that crazy annoying stage. Throw him a bone sometimes, but don't be afraid to stick to your own shit once in a while."

as1z2y,"NTA, she sounds tremendously entitled, and even worse - comfortable in a friend group that has likely enabled and encouraged this sense of entitlement for years.

as267o,"NTA - I think you're taking a very logical approach, especially since he's cheated on you in the past...Twice for that matter.

It's not that I don't trust people, which is true, but logically here...I wouldn't be surprised. 

I AM surprised you're still with him, though I understand it can be complicated with kids. "
as28bw,"NTA, it was an honest mistake....which the other lady thought that this was the hill she wanted to die on and make a dramatic stink about. "
as28cz,"NTA, he sounds like a manipulative /r/niceguys. You did the opposite of ""play games"", you were straightforward and honest about what you wanted. Drop him. "
as29s9,NAH.  You're kind of putting her in an awkward position given that you'll be paying for the festivities.  Have you given her a budget?  It's horribly awkward to make dinner reservations at a nice place with the expectation that the birthday person who had no input on the plans will be paying.
as2bx6,"YTA.

Even if someone is pregnant, they still don't want to be perceived as massive.. It's common sense unless you really know the person and know they won't take it offensively. Most woman when pregnant already feel bloated and feel swollen, they don't need someone that they only kind of know to remind them of what they already know and feel. They still want to feel good and calling someone massive will never do that."

Which one is it?  You can't have both.  If she's that needy that she can't cope, even with advance notice that's her problem.  You have a life, she has a life.  You two can't be together doing the same activity every second of every day."
as2lu5,"NTA as long as your trying to be understanding of them. It sounds like you have what would be considered an exotic name in a country where that’s unusual (US?

as2mt0,"I brought it up with him Christmas 2017, and that's when he said he just doesn't think about me or our relationship as being something he needs to work or spend time on.

If you want a significant other maybe try else where. Shit my guys it's a numbers game. Quit crying about it and get over it. You all sound like a bunch of fedora tipping, m'lady saying test tube gub gub snail men."
as2pot,"NAH, sounds like you’re not the only one shitty at social interactions. He might have spoken before he thought, but he’s also not entitled to that knowledge. Don’t worry yourself over it too much. We all embarrass ourselves at times, but you didn’t need to tell him anything"

Move out if you can so you don't have to be around him as much. Your mother is enabling his actions by not booting him to the curb. "

as2zb5,"NTA. As someone who’s taken care of a dying relative, I think you’re being a bit dramatic about the whole scarring you for life thing, particularly since you don’t really like him. Perhaps you also misunderstood the level of care she wants you to take on. You’re not an asshole for not wanting to help him, but as you mature, you may come to appreciate what helping even when you don’t need to can do for the ailing person and for your family."
as30z3,"NAH.  It doesn't really sound like you two were very close anyway.  Lots of people stop talking when one moves out to college.  I wouldn't look too deeply into it, people just grow apart.  "

as3m0x,YTA alcohol is not an excuse for being shitty. 
as3urk,"NTA.  It's impossible to tell who money belongs to.  If it was a credit card or a wallet where an owner could be identified without question, that's different.  Once a friend of mine found a $100 bill on the ground, and even though I felt really bad for the person who lost it, my friend kept it because finding who lost it would be impossible.  If the store attendant lost the money and was going to get in trouble for it, it would be their fault, not yours."
as3w05,"YTA. It’s understandable you being annoyed but I’m guessing there is some reason you have to fill your own insurance forms that has nothing to do with the receptionist and they may have dropped the ball but it doesn’t give you the right to go round shouting at people doing their jobs. Plus you got annoyed with them because you didn’t see the form but then found it in your trash, sounds like you also dropped the ball by not properly reading your emails. If I was one of those receptionists I’d be screwing up your appointments on purpose after this."
as3w1c,YTA and rude as hell. 
as41dc,"NTA but Dad is for this :

> I calmed down and went back downstairs where he apologized to me later saying he didn't mean me to take it that way...

Uh, if that's the exact wording he used that's a real nice ""non-apology apology. "" It removes the blame and responsibility from him for saying such a thing and transfers onto you for ""interpreting"" it that way. No, what he said was hurtful. "
as42gk,"NTA. Self care is a thing. If you need time off, you need time off. It's not a crime to want some space to *yourself* and not be *with* anyone.

Where this gets tricky, though, is how much of *your* work you're dumping in *her* lap. If you've got your own thing handled and you can pick up the slack later, then I don't see a problem. But if you're just unceremoniously dumping all the chores you were going to do in her lap, that's something else.

It also sounds like she has a very poor grasp on what it is you do to contribute to the family, which is a big red flag to me."

as4nuq,"NTA - Your parents have a very traditional view on what equates success and value. They want the best for you (and security for them in their old age). This doesn't excuse them denying you on other paths of work. The medical field is not for everyone and if you aren't going into it because you want to, there's no point in pursuing it. It is a rigorous field that will chew you up and spit you out without hesitation. It'll be tough now because you're young and living with your parents. You may alienate your parents by choosing a different field, but this is your life. Live it the way you want to.

as4xc3,"NTA. If you're hungry you should be able to get food. You seem to be able to afford it. 

If they cared thst much they should have come to a solution and/or asked if people were too hungry to wait before blowing the decision off for an hour. "
as50p8,NTA: You were absolutely right and they need to respect your boundaries. Having a baby is a shitload of work and they really don't need to be harassing you on top of that
as52ly,Absolutely NTA. She's highly insecure and selfish and wants to be the center of attention 24/7. You're much better off.
as53o3,"NTA. Your friends should respect your decision and support your career choices, not encouraging you to make decisions that may cost you money. Shitty friends if I’m going to be really honest. "

as5c5l,"NTA initially but escalated to YTA. 

It wasn't right for her to assume you'd be okay with her masturbating with you in the room, so you getting mad was NTA. 

However, you admit that you became paranoid about it after and say that you weren't 100% sure that she was doing it again the next 2 times. I think at that point it would have been better to confront her and have a mature conversation. Reporting her again without being absolutely sure was a little bit YTA in my opinion. 

Then, reporting her again after she had moved out was definitely YTA. You have to remember that she moved out of your life. You won't have to deal with her anymore. Your subsequent report seems more like you're trying to get revenge for something that not everyone would say was a big deal. It might have been a big deal to you, but without actually having a conversation with her and explaining your mental health issues, you can't expect her to understand why you're reacting in the manner that you did. Overall I'd say YTA for escalating it even after she moved out. "
as5dk9,NAH. Maybe your dad tells you not to because he’s worried it will actually cause your brother anxiety.

as5stf,"NTA.  Landlord here - you've done what you can do to solve it, so notifying your landlord is the appropriate next step.  Most likely, they'll get as a first step a stern message to stop as well as a reminder that smoke damage/smell comes out of their security deposit (we've had to repaint when apartments have smelled strongly after tenants have moved out)."
as5t6u,I wouldnt say youre an asshole persay. You couldve handled that much more tactfully than you did. You do however seem to have OCD of some sort and an extreme phobia of germs and uncleanliness. I would suggest you seek some form of help to get that under control so it doesnt rule your life.
as5tn7,"NTA- he’s a husband and a father. If he’s not going to be home for a while, he needs to let you know. It’s inconsiderate not to and it leaves you in a limbo of not knowing how long you’re going to have to care for the kids alone after work. "
as5u3p,"> It became our thing to joke about him being my slave but we only joked about it between us in private.

You seemed to have answered your own question. You took a private (inappropriate) joke between you two and brought it to a public setting, without any context to boot.

as5ww0,"NAH, the maturity gap is widening and that can really strain a relationship. Maybe find less competitive activities to do together. It’s not his fault your mom and his dad treat you unfairly, their dysfunction is probably causing his behavioral problems.

You can either choose to distance yourself for your own good or really put in the effort to making sure they don’t fuck this kid up. That’s a lot of responsibility for a kid obviously so either choice is valid."
as60pg,"NTA. You're moving in together, he has a truck, you presumably will need help with larger items.  Did you talk to him in advance of this weekend about getting help from him?  If not, he's a bit less of an asshole, but his reason why is still stupid. No one likes moving."

as6xs0,"NAH. Honestly, you could say your roommate is the A, but I mean, if it makes them u comfortable then they should voice that. However, you are sharing a living space together. That means that you both do all the normal things that come with living... In the same space. So uncomfortable or not, if making out is something you do in your day to day living, your roommate has to understand and do their best to live with it. Whether that means setting loose boundaries like, no making out in the living room while we are both home, or if we are both home do it in your room with the door closed, what have you, they can't just rule part of your life out. So I advise talking and discussing what can be done to make it more comfortable with the understanding that you are under no obligation to stop living for the sake of your roommates comfortability. 

Also, love that you (I assume) misspelled ""living room"" as ""loving room"". "
as6y4f,"What are you on about? The kid straight up asked her if she thought he was fat and she deflected it in one of the most graceful ways a person can possibly be expected to do. There are so many asshole-ish things she could’ve said or done in that situation, but this was not one of them. It’s not like she pulled him aside to tell him he was a fat lump of unhealthiness. She put it back on herself and everyone else in the family so as to NOT be an asshole and make the kid feel bad. He’s just an overly sensitive 12 year old and probably needs a little bit of tough love to shake him out of his bullshit. I was a fat lazy fuck at 12 and I wish I could go back in time and slap the shit out of that version of me."
as6y8d,NAH but it is in bad taste. 
as6y9a,NAH it's a tough place you are in. I can see both points of view. She has a right to change her appearance but she could have talked to you and perhaps waited a bit. If your family gets upset though please stand by your wife and defend her. Grats on the wedding. 
as6ykc,Yeah. YTA - you don't trust her much do you? 
as6ywc,"NTA - Maybe it would be different if this wasn't a competitive club, or if returning members are guaranteed a spot in the next season, but as it stands you are completely within your rights to boot A off the team if he's holding you guys back.  It's not your responsibility to make sure this person makes friends; besides, your club is not about making friends in the first place.  It's about competing, and if A isn't pulling his weight the way he's supposed to, then you shouldn't feel bad about leaving him behind.  There are plenty other clubs he can join that have been created for the specific purpose of accepting socially awkward people like A and helping them make friends while expressing their interests, and he shouldn't have to be coddled by you guys anyway if he's already a freshman in college."
as73cf,"YTA for wasting food. I hope you’re not chucking it in the garbage - you could donate that or give it to someone less fortunate.

as76te,"NTA. If you feel odd asking her to leave outright, perhaps it’s time to fake a call from your mom saying she’s coming to visit to help you get the house ready for baby and you need the space for her. "
as78o9,"ESH/info - if you were supposed to live there for the month and pay a portion of the bill, but you moved out early because you were uncomfortable, you are still responsible for your part of the rent AND utilities.  If he is disabled, he is probably living paycheck to paycheck, and you moving out early just because you were uncomfortable doesn't allow you to get out of paying if you were supposed to.  

Remember that you moving out early doesn't give them enough time to find a roommate instantly, leaving them short on money for bills."

as84xa,"NTA, but maybe the best outcome would be where you just come clean to your fiancee? They won't want to waste money on a watch you don't like, so it'll make them happy to know you're going to like it if you just explain your true taste"

as8mkr,"NTA - those are your wedding photos, and there is absolutely no reason someone should be deliberately showing off their 'baby bump' to take away from the bride in a photo.  If she didn't feel comfortable in the dress, she could have opted out of being in the wedding.  But making the photo shoot about herself and demonstrating her pregnant belly is not acceptable in a wedding photo.  When you look back at the photos, you want to remember the happy times between you guys, not be distracted by her ""on display"" baby bump."

If your girlfriend sees you and another girl acting in a way that makes her think there’s history between you two, and you conveniently fucked that very girl, she’s seeing something that’s there, and you know it. So yes, willfully admitting something you know would be relevant to her question is lying."
as96eg,NTA. You are under no obligation to attend anybody's funeral. You have already gone above and beyond with card and flowers for someone you didn't know well.
as96hf,"NTA, but I’d leave the wife out of it and just ask the sister directly.

Btw - if you’ve got 4 (at least) cables that look like that, there’s almost certainly a matching black spot inside your phone’s port.  It spreads, so any new cable is going to rapidly die, even if kept dry.   Take it (and the 4 dead cables) to an Apple store and ask them to look at it.   

Don’t mention daughters or licking.   It might be a manufacturing fault with the port on the phone, but if you go in admitting possible water (saliva) damage, then they’ll blame that straight away without checking for faults.

as96jr,"NTA.  Oooooh, tell him your generation is the way they are cause they were all left to 'cry it out' as kids. /s

as9fwl,YTA. I can see why you don't have many friends. 
as9go6,"I'm going against the grain saying ESH.

You're an asshole for telling her to stop crying like a baby. Crying is a way for people to express their emotions, regardless of how fake or unnecessary you think it is. Saying that was rude and wasn't actually said to solve the problem. 

She's more an asshole for obvious reasons. 

I think the best course of action would have been telling her that you were annoyed that she didn't focus on the movie and it was incredibly disrespectful to start unrelated conversations during your movie pick. Mention that you watch the movies you hate that she wants to watch because it's respectful. 

Also it depends on if you're the ""family is everything"" type or not. I'm not. If she was being this much of an asshole, I wouldn't invite her to the movie nights you're picking. If she can't be considerate, she can't be a part of it. "
as9kee,"I understand your perspective. If there's a group of people, then ideally they should attempt to form a single file instead of blocking you.

However, **YTA**, for the simple rule that: The thing that is moving faster has a higher responsibility for the safety of everyone. You can slow down, pedestrians cannot. Same applies for scooters, skateboards, bikes on the sidewalk etc.

You are creating the higher risk scenario by choosing to run where most people walk, therefore, you are the one responsible of maintaining the safety (you are the one doing the thing different from the majority)."
as9nk4,Why don't you just invite you girlfriend to the tradition? 
as9ues,"YTA, keep you word, it’s only a few months right? The extended vacation and savings is reward enough in my book. 

Having said that, you are NTA if you want to move  out after the agreed upon time period, next time make sure to take time with your response. My mom and I don’t get along, we are like oil and water, absolutely disagree on everything, last time she needed financial help, I helped pay her bills but refused to move in because I knew it would kill our relationship.

asa19i,"NTA. And no, contrary to what your mom said, it is not ok for your dad to lose his chill. He is an adult, he can take care of his own feewings. If he was really that tired, he could have dropped off the car and she could have driven. You are absolutely justified in wanting to know why things are not allowed. How can you be expected to follow arbitrary rules like that? Makes no sense to me."
asa8i3,"NAH - you’re not wrong and you’re acting out of concern for her. I wonder why she chooses not to have her pills; maybe there’s some issues she’s dealing with? Or maybe she is just forgetful. There’s a lot of good lactose free stuff out there as well if she doesn’t want to have her pills, if they taste that bad - I’m vegan so I know that plant milks and yogurts and things exist and are often pretty indistinguishable. How long has she been prescribed them? "
asaceg,"NTA. Parents shouldn't pressure their kids into situations they don't want for only their benefit. I hope my son will have babies one day but if he doesn't, so be it, I'll be sad but not mad. Plus, you're 17 ffs. You are so young."
asad7x,Nta. Plus do you really want any liabilities of bringing his two kids around your dogs? 
asadme,"NTA for defining a word for a student--it is the kiddo who probably needs some lessons on boundaries, just because she seems to be attaching to her teachers quite a bit. Or maybe that's normal? It's been a while since I worked with non-toddlers. I hope the school winds up not being on the wrong side of this, and there is nothing wrong with what you did in this situation. 

What if that girl (or another student present) winds up questioning their sexuality? Hopefully they'll be reminded of your total self-acceptance, and the fact that this didn't seem like a big deal to you, and then they can translate those feelings of acceptance to themselves even if they don't have the most accepting home life. Just an off chance, but it could really help someone. I had someone do this when I was 13 and that opened the door for me to figure out I wasn't straight. And I had pretty accepting parents. "

This one's tough...cause you were young and shouldn't have to deal with the responsibility of raising your brothers. But you stepped up.

Problem is somewhere along the way your patience just ran out it seems. Taking money and not doing homework is real basic shit that's pretty normal for a 16 year old. You jumped the gun kicking him out in my opinion. And if I was him, I wouldn't really wanna talk to you. "

asc85g,YTA - Pregnancy takes a ridiculous toll on the body and your wife has every reason not to want to run to Hawaii almost immediately after giving birth. Not to mention it isn't a good idea for the baby. And don't go alone... that's not fair at all to leave her with a newborn all by herself.

ascnnc,"NTA ... clearly. She seems like an immature & naive girl who has no sense of appropriateness or personal boundaries. Sure, she’s a teenager, but she is on the far end of the “insufferable” spectrum. Have you discussed her behavior with her parents ? "
asco4l,"NTA. Obviously it is not her responsibility to cure your issue, but also she is acting completely unsupportive and that’s not how normal people act when someone they care about has a problem.

She is being extremely rude and toxic. "

I know it’ll suck for a while but not looking at her backhanded posts makes you stronger than her. And a better person overall. It’s refreshing how much your parents cared to tell you the misdeeds she done to you in the past, too. 

She doesn’t deserve an explanation. Let her talk about you until she’s blue in the face. She’s just wasting her time while you have the chance to live it. "

It isn’t possible for her to get another spot. Also, if you aren’t comfortable doing something in front of your girlfriend, then you probably shouldn’t be doing it at all. Honestly, it doesn’t sound like your relationship is going anywhere if this is the attitude you have towards her and it. "

Wait until the grief is less fresh, and ideally until after you've had a chance to express your condolences untainted by any other sentiments or motivations.

if she isn't planning on doing her resume and not looking at the job board, you can probably assume she's not currently that serious about looking for a position.

You don’t ask your girlfriend of two months to quit her job for you. If her job is a dealbreaker, leave her. 

And, on the flip side, she would be a fool to quit a job that’s good money and pays her rent for some guy she’s only known for two months. 

Edit to add: HOLY FUCK I had missed that you’re offering to financially support her. Dude! You’re an *asshole.* A 36 year old man asking his 26 year old girlfriend to quit her job and become financially dependent on him??? What kind of predator are you??? "
asen8f,"YTA. It doesn’t sound like she’s being a bridezilla. You don’t need to create drama and be the center of attention. You’re supposed to focus on celebrating her and her marriage right now.

You shouldn't feel the slightest bit bad, I'd be scheduling couples therapy honestly. With a baby on the way he should be doing anything and everything to make sure everything is perfect in your environment; stress, anxiety, cravings, etc are not helpful for you during this time or good for your baby's development.

If you don't go, you should try to make up for it anyway you can once they return home.

I dont disagree with your but about needing to bring something to the table. I think you simplified it a bit but I don’t think you are wrong.

My wife is literally an anime character with her figure and has an amazing personality.   I’m decent looking and I’m not funny. I also just have an okay job. 

But we have similar interests and we click really well. Her crazy matches my crazy. 

Your friends problem is he is going after women who he has nothing in common with. Women who aren’t ever going to be interested in him without a drastic change in who he is as a person.  You touched on that and if that had been your focus I don’t think you’d be the asshole.

However, seriously think about it as though you WANTED to go and were looking for good things about moving. It sounds like you're feeling pushed into it and that's enough to make anyone dig in their heels, but try thinking about it for a couple weeks the other way to see what comes up.

You're mis-characterizing frat parties in my experience, and being a little possessive as a result of those preconceived notions.

Sometimes people like to get out and dance and socialize. I've been to parties like the ones you've described for sure, but I've been to a lot more that were just kinda chill.

it sucks. you are not a dumping ground.

you're in a crummy place right now and need a little light while you work to pull yourself out. it's okay for you to make the time and space for yourself to work and get yourself back on track. and if someone's downer dump on you is making that hard for you to do - it is okay to not make as much space for them.

The movies aren’t just your thing with your friend. Neither of you really had concrete plans for the movie so it’s not like you’re ditching them. You’re allowed to see them with other people and your friend’s anger about the situation is a little concerning. Do they feel neglected by you? Do they not like your boyfriend? Also, do they get mad at you frequently over similar situations?

Anyway, this is some middle school bullshit that your friend is pulling. You can either find a compromise and go see the movies all together or you can tell your friend that you don’t have to see everything together to enjoy the experience of these movies."

aslldr,NTA. Does not sound like he has pure intentions. He is high key trying to seduce/take advantage of you.
aslm4i,"YTA.  And I will explain why.

I'm very torn on this one.  You are correct that a person has to be respectful and has to change their tone and presentation to suit their audience.  This isn't about his freedom or his identity.  It's just basic pragmatism.  And you should probably seriously consider cutting your ties with someone who is not an adult and doesn't seem interested in changing.  He can be a dirty homeless hippy without you.

ON THE OTHER HAND...  When I read things like ""catholic military father in the south"" and ""blind respect for authority,"" my gut tells me that YTA.  I cannot stomach how anyone with half a brain would think that ""blind respect for authority"" is actually a good thing. If that is what you are asking of him then he should run away screaming, and be happy he dodged a bullet.  Given my experience with red-state religious authoritarian bigots, I have a hard time believing that your interpretation of the story is objective and accurate.

My question is...   Do you want your boyfriend to follow social norms in a general sense?  Or do you want him to follow YOUR red-state authoritarian catholic social norms?"

asna7h,"NTA. Not wanting to deal with a bedbug infestation is entirely reasonable. Reporting the issue made sure that there were zero doubts that the workspaces were now safe for everyone (kudos to management for dealing with it so quickly).

This might be only annoying  now but it gets worse over the years. But this is not the place to get advice. This is something the two of you have two work out. This is something where both of you have to acknowledge the needs and feelings of the other and find a solution that works. That's what marriage - or any other long-term relationship - is all about."

Sure, request a single room, but it’ll be more expensive for whoever’s paying your room & board whether it be you or someone else. "
asp9mc,"Very clearly NTA.

Family is family until a certain point, after that they're just people you grew up with.

asph3w,ESH... she should’ve respected your opinion in finding the comment rude but you also should’ve just acknowledged it as a simple joke and not necessarily directed towards you.

However I wouldn’t necessarily call these issues red flags. 
asphhf,"NAH - It's not their fault that you can't understand them, but it's not your fault for not understanding. As long as you word your explanation kindly you should be ok.

asphul,"NAH. I understand that your mom wants to help you out as much as she can (which makes her overbearing, but not into asshole territory).

That's the kind of trip that takes a lot of planning, especially if your ex is trying to coordinate it with a large extended family.  If this is the only weekend that his whole family can go, then do you really think this is the kind of thing that can be rescheduled so easily? 

> He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. 

That's because you are the bad guy. You are being incredibly small, selfish and petty, and it sounds like you are using this opportunity to get back at your ex and his family somehow.  What you are really doing is damaging your relationship with your kids.  This drama isn't even about your kids, it's about you and how you are being (in your opinion) so, so wronged. If you value your kids and your relationship with them, be flexible.  "

asq0n0,"NTA, honestly your boyfriend sounds like a jerk. Why the mixed signals? If he said he’d pay for it, he shouldn’t say halfway through the meal that you’re on your own based on what you’ve ordered... only to reverse course a third time by the end of the night. No wonder you’re upset. I would be, too- not because he wanted me to pay, but because he changed his mind about it so many times and then didn’t understand why I was irritated. "
asq6qn,"NTA.  Not only was your question in no way inappropriate, it's absolutely *vital* that you two be able to discuss these issues and make sure you're on the same page if you're going to pursue a serious commitment.  The fact he feels ""attacked"" by you simply bringing this up suggests that at minimum he's more conflicted about the situation than he wants to let on and projecting those feelings on to you - and frankly, I'd take it as a warning that you should be prepared for this not to work out."

1. Shouldn't be so insane about your stats on a classic game redone, unless you're close to being the absolute highest wins ever in the game, about to be acknowledged by guineas book of World records, your stats aren't that important.

2.If you play the game so much, your nephew losing 5 times shouldn't harm your stats that much. 

3. Saying that you pay for your online, is absolutely not an argue point. It's $20. Big whoop. I live in Poland and paid that shit immediately without even a hesitation when I got smash. ESPECIALLY that they even got the console for you.

4. Letting a little kid play something that you, an older person is playing, is a huge thing for them. When they look up to/see big uncle playing, so they want to be like uncle OP. And you take that from them just cause he will lose bad. Let the kid have fun you dick.

TLDR- YTA. $20 is nothing, they bought you the system, stats don't mean shit, 5 extra losses won't kill you, kids are cute.

asr3jf,"YTA. It sounds to me like they wanted time away from everything, including their friends.

Just because it annoys you a bit doesn't mean you should shit on their fun. They like doing it. And they probably would like having you in the pics. You may even end up unintentionally making them feel self-conscious for doing something they enjoy 

I used to do the same thing. I have some friends who were always taking pics and even taking multiples and I used to complain all the time because it felt fake, or like a waste of time. Also, if I'm being honest, I didn't want to seem like a basic bitch who was always taking selfies instead of actually living in the real world. A big reason for why I felt this way was because of other friends I had who would talk shit about girls who take too many selfies, etc. I did this in college too. Now that I'm a little older (24), I regret this attitude. I'm not close anymore with most of my childhood and high school friends. We all grew apart, except for one of my friends and I, which is normal. I still think fondly of those times and I'll look at old pictures from parties or events that I went to and I'm barely in ANY of the pictures! You won't always remember all the cool things you did so it's nice to have pictures to look back on! "
ass5r8,"YTA - Wow. I almost can't decide how to tag this. Ultimately I went with YTA because I think that you're doing a poor job of putting on your bf's shoes.

On one hand, I don't blame your boyfriend at ALL. I just lost a relationship to this, and my ex of TWO YEARS is now dating the guy she told me not to worry about. So clearly my intuition was correct. (Mind you this was someone my gf lied to me about DURING our relationship, so the writing was on the wall)

The way your bf feels is logical, and I totally get it. Sure it is a sign of insecurity to a point, but I can't imagine many partners being totally ok with this.  And he's communicating with you about it, so that's a **very good thing.** I also commend you for your honesty with HIM. But, unfortunately, that honesty has also probably made this ""Friendship"" of yours worse for him to bear.

You are right, he doesn't get to tell you who you can be friends with, but you also don't get to tell him how he should feel about your friendships either. Ultimately you two need to sit down and really hash this out.

He needs to decide if your friendship with cody is a dealbreaker. And you need to decide if you're prepared to lose your relationship for this friendship.

At the very least I think it should be inappropriate for you to be totally alone with cody or in altered mindstates with him (drunk/high etc) I just don't think that's an appropriate way to behave within a monogamous relationship."

ast10y,YTA Is it that hard to collect and take away your recycling?! Come on! It's right outside your building. In my country you have to take most of your recycling to special collection places and people still do it. 
ast2td,YTA - let other people make their own minds up. People hate being preached too.
ast2vi,"I was leaning toward YTA for saying something about the past that is unnecessary, but it seems that this was actually something she needed to hear. Maybe not taken to heart, maybe no lesson learned, but she does need to be told to respect someone's no as a no and that her pushiness is not always appreciated. Also, she should have apologized instead of getting defensive. NTA"

ast6mo,"ESH: You shouldn't cut off relations with A just because you have issues with his girlfriend. As for the relationship issues, A and B should talk it out with each other rather than going to a separate party because you aren't the one responsible for their falling out. I do think though that A is getting the lower end of the deal with all this, loosing a great friend and being in that sort of tension."
astbz0,"NTA

>I hate that he has taken on the behaviour I hated in Scrooge and my dad.

This statement is very concerning. That, couples with some of your mother's other behavior would lead me to believe that your MOM is the problem here. Not Scrooge, not your dad, not your brother. Your mom. Sounds like she is the common denominator causing changes in the behaviors of the people closest to her."
astcwa,NTA he clearly is an immature fuckwit. 
astdc5,"NTA, and just because he's ""like this with everyone"" doesn't make it right.  Your friends are just making excuses for him, and by doing nothing, are condoning his behavior.

Find some friends that value you as a person. "
aste08,I feel like it was totally inappropriate and unprofessional for her. What the hell. She was out of line
asteiy,NTA: I assume this is because of past sexual relations or abuse. You should not feel like you are an asshole. Your friend on the other hand is inconsiderate of why you do this and they should respect your situation.
astgo8,"NTA. 

Call child services, then evict both the sister and her boyfriend. IMHO, you never should have let the BF live there."
astis2,NTA. There's strict parents and there's over controlling parents. Yours fall into the latter category. My daughter flew from Amsterdam to Dublin (round-trip) with her friends to go see Taylor Swift when she was 17...
astkh1,NTA here.  You are an adult.  Your parents no longer get to police your pleasure.  Enjoy the sex.  
astr6c,NTA - You're sixteen. If you want out then get out. You have your entire life ahead of you still. Fuck that guy. 
astufs,NTA. You have to put you and your daughter's happiness and stability first. You can't say that you haven't tried to make it work.
astw8e,"YTA. So is the teacher, who is a position of authority who works with children (which you ARE) and is behaving badly.  Just because you think the guy is cool, that doesn't mean he is a good teacher or a good person.  Let's break it down:

* inappropriate remarks - I notice you don't tell us what they are, but I'm willing to bet they are unprofessional.
* showing the classes R rated films - I don't care if you are close to 18, adults shouldn't screen these films in class without parental consent.  What movies did he show?  Did it fit with the curriculum? Was there an educational purpose?
* T said something along the lines of ""Have you ever considered killing yourself?"" - seriously not OK. No adult should say this to a kid ever, not when joking, not when serious. An adult teacher isn't familiar with the mental health of every kid they teach. What if he said this to someone who was suicidal or depressed?  And even if the kid doesn't have mental health issues, this is incredibly disrespectful. 

Support your friend. Don't support the teacher - he is not your friend and is doing you a disservice."
asu4xr,"NTA. I’m no doctor or scientist, but as a weed smoker who hates the glorification of weed and who’s done his fair share of research on weed in general, I’m fairly sure she shouldn’t be smoking. There are other ways to deal with morning sickness. "
asubrs,"NTA - I'm seriously considering making a PSA about this. Don't bring your sick kids to group events. The kids are miserable, and it's not fair to everyone else.

asudh6,"NAH, he gave it a shot, was respectful and moved on once you said you were in a relationship. "
asufba,"YTA for punishing a kid for something they did weeks ago. That's like years to a 9 year old. If you're going to punish them for something, do it immediately. If you wanted to make a point, you made it. Excluding a 9 year old from a group activity for something they did weeks ago is just mean.

Next time if you want to discipline a kid, it has to be immediate. That's just how their brains work. ""Tickle my ears and it's no dessert tonight."" is a good one.  


(YTA for the timing reason only. Withdrawing a privilege as a punishment is totally reasonable.)"
asuin1,[deleted]
asuiyp,NTA. She sounds unhealthy for you to be around and you shouldn't have to subject yourself to that. I would advise just telling her that her planned visit doesn't work for you rather than giving her a specific lie that may be found out later on.
asujnf,NTA - If she doesn't take care of her current pets she doesn't deserve another one. End of story. Maybe consider parting ways at the end of your lease. 
asujoz,"NTA - I say give it like two more days and go full action movie on her. Kick in the door, throw smoke grenades, take their WiFi router and coffee maker hostage. Ya know, normal stuff. Get those cookies by any means necessary.

asume2,"I’d say no a-holes here. 

Listen bro, it’s your choice to be in the friend zone. Either be her friend or don’t. Just tell her you don’t want to be friends because that’s not what your relationship is at this time.

If you’re worried about your feelings don’t be her friend, it’s not worth it.

"
asuqqz,NTA you can’t stay in a toxic relationship just to support a toxic person at the cost of your own mental health

asv1oy,"You can forgive them without going back to being friends with them. Let go of the anger in your heart, while also realizing they are toxic and you should stay away from them."
asv3li,NTA - cease all contact with her. She sounds crazy enough to harm you. 
asv3u4,NTA - seems like this is your advisors problem. 24 hours is not much notice and there were definitely good reasons for being late. Your advisor didn't plan ahead.
asv5x4,YTA and it also sounds like you may have some dysmorphia. Size 8 is not fat. 
asvdz8,I’m sorry but NTA. Just because she’s your mother does NOT mean you’re obligated to treat her with respect if she doesn’t treat you with respect. That doesn’t mean you need to disrespect her. Just limit the interaction as much as you can and walk away. 
asvjld,NTA. You shouldn't have to hug people you don't know and they don't need any reason as to why you don't want to. 
asvklm,NAH. She just wants to be around you and you just want some space. Communicate with her and make time for her outside of the parties.

asvonj,NTA however if you are just looking to get rid of it  please consider donating it to a museum. I know it seems like a horrible thing ( at Least I think it's pretty bad)but there is something to be said for its historical significance.

asvszu,NTA it's your land. He has no right to dump his crap on it. Lawyer up.

You don't even know this guy. He isn't part of your life at all. You owe him nothing."
aswa1c,"Going against the grain and saying YTA. You're *not* an asshole simply for caring about your friend and her wellbeing, but you *are* the asshole for continuously ignoring her requests for you to back off. You have no right to force her to send you pictures of her arms daily, every other day, every week, whatever. *Especially* when she has asked you to stop. Whether or not you like it, it's her body and this is the way she's decided to cope with whatever she's dealing with. It's not a healthy coping mechanism, but constantly being on her case is just going to add undue stress, and could actually have the opposite intended effect (eg, the added stress leads her to cut *more* or cause her to just hide her cuts better). If you really want to help, offer to be there for her. And if at any point, she asks you to give her space, then give it to her. "

aswgjp,NAH but you aren’t the only parent they have to deal with often. It’s easy to forget things like this in administrative work. 
aswgyh,"NAH.

To say either of you are assholes is a stretch. Maybe, there was some sort of lack of communication, but triggers are relatively uncommon, and both of you probably weren't thinking too straight. Just a miscommunication, that's all. No need to sweat it. If you haven't formally apologized, I recommend that you do."
aswid7,"NAH. Your feelings are valid, but there are people who likely needed to fly more imminently/desperately- people who needed to get to work and would financially struggle if they got home later, people with urgent funerals, weddings, etc to go to. He didn’t sell off his time with you for $1000, he allowed people who would turn down $1000 to go wherever they needed to, which would be somewhere/something worth a lot to them. There were limited spaces for people to fly imminently and your husband did something that is selfless in terms of impact on others and selfish in terms of letting you down, but I think it’s worth considering the benefits of him coming home a day later and hopefully making it up to you fully.

Really? She isn't sure she likes the direction the relationship is going, and doesn't like that she and you have got comfortable, so you don't talk, you drag her and her stuff out of the house and tell her you will never talk again?? Man, she dodged a bullet.

aswlw8,NAH and it sounds like a very unfortunate situation. I do agree with her though that it would be unfair for her to have to care for the dog for 11 months then lose it when you get back. It sounds like the only fair solution for both of you is to have him stay with your family.

Consider his perspective. He also lives in the house. He sees these disgusting mystery dishes in the sink - and also knows that they’re not his. But unless he nags you guys about them, he knows that they will continue to just sit there because you’re all a bunch of fucking slobs. So he’s just asking for a little bit of help. He’s not trying to be fucking Sherlock Homes and uncover clues as to whose dishes they are. He’s trying to fix the problem *right now*. So he’s like “let’s just do this together and get it done.” And you’re sitting there with your thumb up your butt mumbling “it wasn’t me doe.” The chores you mentioned was from *a month* ago.

It doesn't sound like the guy is violent or a criminal. I would agree with you if you were worried he would cause a fight  or scene, steal, etc etc, while there. But it doesn't sound like there is a chance he will ruin your wedding, you just don't like him.  Is it worth the relationship with your sister? 6 months is a decent amount of time of dating, it's not like one month. What if she ends up being with this guy for a while and this causes a huge rift between you? I guess it's up to you if that's worth it. "

at0tn5,"NTA - play bitch games, win bitch prizes.

The second she did the baby reveal to score points in a Facebook spat she would have been on extremely thin ice with me. Which would have broken very quickly with her subsequent behavior. What she said about the gender and the miscarriage was disgusting and totally uncalled for and shows who she really is. 

Your baby. Your husband. Your family. She's extended family now, not nuclear. 

You are owed a *real* apology, and your partner needs to be the one to pull her into line, to show her that you two are a united front and a team. 

Being a grandparent is a *privileged position*, one that can be revoked by the parents if you piss them off enough.

Please seek therapy, OP. Your brother doesn't understand your anxiety and reads your behavior incorrectly as rudeness. From the outside, putting your head down and walking away when a friend comes up to him will seem unusual and rude to the friend, putting your bother in an awkward situation. Of course, you're not doing it on purpose to be rude and don't seem to be aware of how it's perceived. If you can, try to imagine it from the friend's perspective.

Though you may not be able to see it, it seems like your anxiety is deeply affecting your life in a negative way. You have to live in a state of anxiety any time you're in a social setting, your brother is hurt and angry, and you're missing making social connections with other people. You cried and had a fight over it. It probably takes a lot of time and energy worrying about it, right? And it's something that can only be negative, never positive. Finding someone to help you work through it is probably the best option.

Sorry you're going through this, OP. Don't think of yourself (or your brother) as an asshole. You didn't do anything wrong, you're just struggling to find your way through an unfortunate illness that affects millions of people."

My wife and I have locks on our phones that we don't ""share"" (although theres been times where we have asked the other to unlock/access our phones) but constantly deleting everything to make sure you don't accidentally find out.

If this is your first baby (heck not even first), realize that like your going through pregnancy brain, he is going through shit too.

Maybe you’re not too familiar with clubs but most consent is given non-verbally in my experience. Someone touches your shoulder or waist, if you don’t like it you move away and if you like it you stay there. So really, this exchange probably happened but you just didn’t notice. 

Also if someone is dancing and somehow balancing on an elevated podium they’re probably NOT unconscious-drunk. I would say you violated her boundaries far more by yanking her down violently than that guy. Most likely scenario is that she enjoyed dancing with him and it was none of your business.

Edit: Also to add that some women do go to clubs just to meet/dance with guys. I used to be one of them and those roaming groups of girls that would try to “mom” me were absolutely insufferable. Respect that not everyone wants the same as you and not everyone goes to clubs just to hang with girlfriends and sneer at all passing men.

NTA, your boyfriend is either a dick or needs to communicate better.

If this was simply a case of her buying the jackets on her own as gifts and him not wearing them as often, that'd be one thing and the majority of comments would be justified. But in both cases she was present when he expressed interest in them, implying that he would wear them, and on the second occasion she even politely asked how often he'd wear the jacket to which he said ""probably 2 or 3 times a week in the colder months.""

This jacket was fucking $550, or $385 if they bought it on sale as mentioned. This isn't just pocket change, and to get super excited, tell someone you'd wear it often, and then stick it in your closet and bring it out twice over a period of months is being an asshole. Maybe it's not intentional, and the boyfriend is simply comfortable in what he has (which is common with guys) but then he shouldn't have expressed how often he would wear it. Yes, the items are his, but it's completely an asshole move for him to lie about how often he'd wear it when his girlfriend was dropping serious cash on it under the presumption that he would wear it.

Working a 70% job plus taking care of three children and probably doing more of household chores since you are rarely there because of your job?

Seeing as it is, she's got neither. And you shouldn't blame her for that. You can't force her to suddenly be interested in that and sacrifice time to become a better cook. It sounds like you take her cooking for you for granted, which you shouldn't. She's right to tell you to just cook for yourself if you don't like it.

You’re right, you volunteered to organize everything and you got the discount from Airbnb for $40 on your new account.

After that, the points and discount that you earned from your credit card are entirely yours. It’s your fucking credit card, the offer wouldn’t have existed without that. I don’t understand why anyone would think they were entitled to those rewards. 

But again the amount is so small it just seems petty to really make a big deal over it. How many people would you be splitting this with? If the $150 needs to be split more than three ways it’s just insignificant.

atld31,"NTA

but good fences make good neighbors. calling the cops will only lead to a lifetime of hostility."
atlflv,"NTA, a lot of the reason pitbulls have such bad reputations is because of owners like your friend who can't recognize when they're not in control of the situation. A dog with that kind of history needs a lot of experience and patience, not some oblivious idiot who keeps saying ""oh, it's fine.""

I've met a lot of pitbull owners like that unfortunately, and they keep dumping them because ""s/he's too aggressive"" only to get another one and make the exact same training mistakes again. It makes me sick, they're truly not bad dogs but a lot of the people drawn to them tend to be bad owners."
atlhsz,NTA. Nobody likes a leech. It's not like she's taking care of a child or cleaning a big house every day. Tell her if she doesn't want to do what she offered to do (cooking & cleaning) then ask her for her half of the rent/bills.
atlix7,"I'm going to say NTA because you told her specifically that if she didn't need it, to give it away. The entire purpose of giving it to her was to make use out of it, but instead she's trying to make money out of it."

atm911,"Based on the fact she asked you to help, ruling NTA. If she was selling them without asking your assistance I'd say no one is at fault. She has a right to sell, you have a right to be upset. Asking you to help is rubbing your nose in it and that's not okay."
atmb2c,"NTA, I don't know if you or he are definitively an asshole or not though your husband sounds like one, but for your husband to just leave the room when you start talking about pretty much anything is a sign that you two need some counseling or something.

atmjad,"NAH

Honestly, it sounds like you guys gave it a good go and just weren't compatible in an area that is very important to you.

A lot of people maintain healthy open relationships, so you suggesting that doesn't make you an asshole.  If she expressed that she was uncomfortable with it and you still went forward, that would be a different story.

I'm really sorry to hear that you've lost a 6 year relationship, but it sounds like you're both going to be much happier in the long term for it."
atmjv0,"YTA for not at least offering. Yes he may have to go that way anyway but why not share the expense at least some of the time. Owning a car can be expensive, so someone offering to split the cost can help. "
atmke1,I'd say NAH since you did your very best to make sure she has a good time. So you're definitely not TA. But I can also understand her desire to spend as much time as possible with you even on your Gamenight. You don't suck OP and your GF wasn't kind to you. Maybe it will work out in the future. I wish you luck :)

Gotta look out for yourself. The smell is one thing, but voluntarily introducing bed bugs into your life is a whole different story."

She gave it to you as a gift, and you can’t really take a gift back. That’s like giving money to charity and asking for a refund."
atmqxc,NAH you might just have to be prepared for the fact that y'all aren't compatible and y'all might eventually break up over this. She's being very upfront about what she's into and how she prefers to live her life. Unfortunately it doesn't look like she's willing to compromise that for you. If you're unwilling to compromise your beliefs for her then y'all will probably break up.
atmrsz,YTA. You’re being petty. You know what she means. If you have a problem with the way she phrases things then talk to her about it. Stop the passive aggressive BS.
atmsf4,NTA. Appointing someone to a position like that without consulting them is rude. 
atmu3y,"NTA. Your house your rules. My friend has 2 little dogs and brings them to peoples houses uninvited and it’s a source of contention. When i dog sat for a week one of them pissed on my couch. So now they can’t come. 

I love dogs and am a crazy dog person, but I’m also self aware enough to know not everyone is. So my doggo doesn’t go places he’s not invited. "
atmun6,"NAH.

You aren't required to invite people to anything simply because they are your friends, but he is free to be upset at not being invited on the basis that you are friends. The fact that he was at a concert anyways makes me wonder why he even bothered to mention it, but I imagine this will all blow over."
atmwh8,"NAH. You are perfectly within your right to feel the way you do, but your ex didn't do anything wrong either. He can move on as fast as he wants to and with whoever he wants to. Your friend is kind of inconsiderate though."
atmxat,YWBTA. I think at this point you should probably let well enough alone. Adding extra pressure to the man would just add to the substantial amount of pain he is already in. Maybe offer a place to stay in a spare bedroom if he truely is a good friend. Im sure he is well aware of the problem but he is dying and is in no condition to deal with the fire marshall or any other legal troubles.
atn361,"NTA. At first I thought you were asking about changing your mind because someone better came along. But this is different, and it’s definitely a valid reason to break your plans. You shouldn’t do anything you’re not comfortable with."
atn64y,NAH. Just tell them you want some time with them and not their significant others once in a while.

atn7h3,"YTA but not for the reason she stated. 

From the sounds of it you’re working out in a public gym shortly after suffering an open wound. You might even have been doing so right after the wound was inflicted but was just hiding it until now. 

It’s a potential public health hazard to exercise with open or not completely healed wounds. Others might have microscopic skin tears from exercising and you may have a disease you’re not aware of, or they may be immunocompromised and something completely harmless to you can be dangerous to them. 

Please consider others safety. The lady may have been coming out from a wrong place but she’s not wrong about the gym etiquette and rules. 

Edit: typo. "

You aren't an asshole for wanting to elope, I totally understand the draw of something small and intimate, just for you. That being said, it's your fiancee's wedding too, so what they want should carry some weight.

She could drink non alcoholic or say she's on a diet or something and doesn't want to drink a bunch if calories. Maybe she would have just announced her pregnancy. It should have been her choice."
atnpgw,"NTA, she's accusing you of old issues? That kinda feels like what a guilty person would do.
Anyway, it sure sounds sketchy. Sounds like she's hiding something, doesn't have to be cheating, but something."
atnu6j,"NAH. He is really attached to this couch, and it sounds like its seen better days and doesn’t mesh well with your decorating style. That being said, spending several thousand dollars to remove a structural column to accommodate an old busted sectional is extreme. However, if this is the one thing he has asked for in the new house, he may hear your refusal to have his busted beloved couch as unreasonable. Perhaps you can choose a new couch together, even if it is a leather sectional that I doubt you want but a smaller size and in better condition?"
ato1sc,"NTA - Family or not, your uncle royally fucked up here and even tried to hid it from you guys.  Hell, if I was in your position, I wouldn't even give him the option.  His only option should be to fix the bike and that's that."
ato245,"NTA, but only if you’re using the non-emergency number if one is available. "
ato2pf,"NTA - You felt concern for a friend, you tried to help in a non-confrontational way, and she decided not to take your advice. It's frustrating, but, like you said, she's an adult. 

As a separate piece of advice, if you truly believe this new relationship might be abusive (or come to suspect that in the future), definitely don't cut her off. She may feel embarrassed because she recognizes the same things about her relationship dynamics that you do. She may need support to leave this person in the future, and that often requires support from others. To be clear, you aren't responsible for ""saving"" people or overextending yourself emotionally by any means, but if you have the emotional bandwith to maintain ties with this person, I would consider it."

atr402,"NTA.  Nobody can force you to work, period. You probably *should* have let somebody know that you were leaving the job.  But it sounds like your boss isn't good at his job and if he were even a little bit competent, it wouldn't have been an issue."

Rather than listening to her (y'know, the person who has to live with these people day in and day out), you presume to know better and decide that her parents would definitely listen to you and suddenly change their entire behavior and approve of this event.

Your best bet will be to apologize to your friend and listen to her in the future when she says no."

atscg4,"NTA.  You are entitled to have a politics-free facebook and the fact that your Mom/family can't see that says WAY THE FUCK MORE about them than it does you.   I don't know much about how GAD affects you, but the fact that you see harmful situations and try to avoid them rather than indulging a relative just to keep the peace tells me that you HAVE made progress and, just in case no one has told you yet, I am proud of you for that, internet stranger.   "
atse0d,"NTA - but... if all it is, is rumors then what if you’re wrong and she doesn’t cheat? And you confront her about it when it’s not real? Then maybe YTA. 
 
Honestly as a gamer girl myself, it drives me nuts with the girls who ask for a ton of stuff all the time. But you don’t have to confront her over it. Just start distancing yourself in conversation a bit more and she should get the message. Monosyllabic answers, grunts to her comments, no follow up questions. When she asks you what’s wrong just say you’re tired a lot. 
 
Unless you have proof of the cheating, don’t call her on that. It’s not up to you to police her. If you aren’t comfortable with trading or favors with her then don’t do it. That’s it. "
atse23,"I think it depends on whether or not you had any conversations with Fred abour your frustrations and concerns. All relationships need proper communication.

However I will have to say that the rest of your family also have the right to interpret your actions how they wish (since it seems other people still like your grandma). You’re free to do what you want but also don’t be surprised when others have negative reactions. Prepare to have thick skin, basically. "

atsyeu,YTA you want to pay less money cause you found the place originally and bought the appliances? The appliances will still be yours when everyone moves out. I don’t understand why either of those 2 factors enter the equation. You often think about how you set your friend up in the country and helped him out? Whats that got to do with how much rent he pays? It sounds a bit as if you resent his success.
att2ef,"NTA.  Your friend won free tickets, then ""invited you"" to sweeten the deal and get free food, transport *and* swag.   It was good manners of you to thank him by covering the food and ride.   Your friend's expectations of you as a starving student are over the top. "
att51n,"NTA

Dude...this is a shitpost. You guys are already breaking up, for good reasons. You know what your intentions were when you said those things, and you know that she's misconstruing them."
att8vv,"NTA

Two red flags. She wants to control who you hang out with, and she's jealous without cause. 

You're 3 months in? Let me tell you something: this is the tip of the iceberg. "
attag6,"> [manager] was mad at me because the husband and wife come 3 times a week and how my actions or how I dealt with the issue may have lead to losing a regular.

NTA.     Your manager is an asshole for expecting you to tolerate abuse and mind-read that they are regulars/ entitled to special treatment.  

The regulars could have said ""hey, we know it's last call,  is [manager] around?"" and waited to speak directly to the manager to arrange their special request.  They reacted totally inappropriately by swearing, making a scene and flipping you off.

You were just doing your job.  NTA, not at all."
attap8,ESH. I understand it may be frustrating that he owns you money but don’t make such a big deal about it. You made such a big deal to the point where your mom gave you the money he owed. My advice would be to let it slide. It’s only $20. It’s not worth destroying your relationship over.
attcid,"ESH ... but your reaction is understandable.  Who the hell does she think she is?  Sounds like she refuses to accept her bf's primary role as your father. 

If I can share ... my Dad let his gf yell at me over the years.  I used to yell back.   My Dad encouraged that toxic envrionment.  I shouldn't have yelled, but I was young and sad and frustrated.  She shouldn't have been allowed to yell at me, either.    I wish he encouraged healthier ways to resolve conflict. 

  My point is:  **don't make my mistake and wait for your Dad to set the tone.**  Choose the woman you want to be now.  Don't allow her to yell at you by stopping to say ""I won't be yelled, talk to me when you are ready to talk"" and *walk away*.  **You do NOT have to accept that abuse.**   Conversely,  don't yell at her, either.  It's hard.   **The only way I could break the cycle was for *me* to set the standard.**  "
attid5,"YTA. Infatuation can make it really hard to act reasonable sometimes, it's understandable. But these are close friends who are like siblings to you, and as soon as you get in a relationship, you spend *every day* with him and obviously are spending less time with them? I mean, put yourself in their shoes. How would you feel if one of them got in a relationship and spent all of their time with their new boo and significantly less with you? Even if you still try to talk to them daily and keep up with them, if you're spending every day with him, you're obviously cutting down on the time you spend with them a great deal.

Don't let a romantic relationship get in the way of strong friendships like this. Two reasons. For one, if a romantic relationship is starting to kill your other relationships, it's a bad sign. A healthy relationship shouldn't dominate every day of the week, or every facet of your life. It should be an aspect, not the focus. Relationships like that can get really toxic. Secondly, there's no saying how long this relationship will last. If you're essentially throwing away your friendships for this relationship, and then this relationship ends, you're left with no friends to support you and you end up worse off overall.

My advice is pretty simple - spend less time with him and more time with your friends. Find a balance between your time with your boyfriend and your time with your friends/other aspects of your life. Spending almost every day over the past 2+ months with him is extreme. Maybe cut it down to 3 or 4 days a week, have time to spend with your friends and focus on other areas. This is still a fresh relationship, you aren't married. Don't act like it."
attrz9,NTA. She sounds very controlling. Decisions regarding finance should be joint decisions and compromise on both sides is healthy.
atttj0,"NTA - You must cut and run. I’ve had exes like this before and from the inside it’s easy to get wrapped up and take her reasons at face value. But what’s the point of a relationship? To find the right partner to spend the rest of your life with? If that’s the point, then can you see yourself spending the rest of your life with her always controlling how you spend your time? 

People don’t change. You can’t change people. Things will only get worse if this ldr turns into a short distance relationship and especially worse if you guys get married. 

It sucks, but cut out while you still can. "

atu57e,"ESH.

Ultimately you don’t trust him or you wouldn’t care who he hung out with. Because if you trust them to not cheat it doesn’t matter what the history is because you TRUST them regardless of the intentions of others.

However if he is serious about wanting to be with you he shouldn’t be threatening you with “tests”. I get wanting to see how someone reacts in different situations before marrying them, but to purposely taunt you that is so shitty."
atua5o,"NAH.  Look, don't judge people for how they process their grief.  Grief is weird, feelings are weird.   (If they really weren't that close then maybe the tears came as a strong beginning and end to their grief? Who knows.) 

**They aren't assholes for crying at a funeral; you aren't an asshole because you, too, are grieving** and maybe have some feelings caught up in here. "
atuenl,"YTA.

Your friend specifically said don't invite somebody to something you and he did together. You wanted to see N at the expense of J simply because you have romantic feelings for N. Go and do something alone with N. J is entitled to disliking N and you shouldn't force them to co-operate when he has blatantly said he doesn't like him. Also the fact you have feeling for him but just string him around as a friend is kind of weird. "
atuga9,"NAH - You didn't do it on purpose, don't be too hard on yourself. "
atugyk,"NTA. You guys are in an adult relationship with a child and that requires effort from both people in the relationship.

Why should he be responsible for your portion of the deposit. When he moves out he’ll be responsible for his portion, how is it being scammed if you haven’t done any damage?

> ""I asked her to give a medical certificate for suffering for such intense periods""

First of all, are you her boss or working in HR?  If not, that is a GROSS invasion of privacy and exactly NONE of your business.   Periods, for some women, can go beyond minor cramping and right into the type of pain that sends them to the ER.  It can lead to anemia, iron deficiency, vomitting, etc. so it's not as simple as ""Oh, she's just using this as an excuse to get out of working!"" and for you to claim it is, is sexism - plain and simple.

> ""I shouted at her saying how unprofessional this was""

And asking someone you don't know well to provide a medical certificate that they were indeed suffering was NOT unprofessional/inappropriate? Unless she named you by name, you had NO right to call her out and certainly not at work.

I don't think it's wrong to cross check facts you're unsure of. I think having a baby is stressful and you're wife reacted out of fear, so it's understandable. Initially you didn't know for certain if it was good or bad, so her feelings are totally justified. I think next time maybe approach her more conversationally like ""I was doing some research and found it's not bad at all so luckily our baby should be fine"".

au5ki8,"ESH - You're right that she's kind of apologizing wrong (by shifting blame instead of just accepting responsibility, it contradicts the apology and makes it appear insincere), and reorganizing your room without consulting you resulted in inconveniencing you, and she should be a little sorry, even if it was well-intentioned. 

But, dude. *Dude.* ***Let it go.***

It wasn't *that* big a deal, and you should be acknowledging that whatever the result, *she was just trying to help*, and at the end of the day, it should not be worth fighting this much over so small a thing. In the time it's taken you to be an ass about this to her, she could have just shown you where everything was, or the two of you could have re-reorganized the room together. But instead you've insisted on picking at this scab day after day so what could and should have been a minor argument is now a Whole Big Thing.

Your repeatedly demanding that she ""come over here and apologize to me again"" is controlling, bossy, and just plain *bitchy* behaviour. That's not how you treat someone in a relationship. She's supposed to be your partner, not your assistant.

At some point in the future, when this has blown over, it might be safe and worthwhile to have a conversation about why you think that when an apology is warranted, ""I'm sorry but here's why it's not really my fault"" is not the best way to put it. But not now."

My issue is with this:

Don't lose sight of self-preservation in pursuit of some abstractly perceived moral good.

You are essentially inconveniencing the deliveryperson to avoid having to (possibly) deal with three seconds of a potential spam call. 

Delivery guys, in my experience, have a lot on their plate, often english is not their first language, they are on a super tight schedule, and may not realize that the message is a strange set of specific instructions as opposed to a standard voicemail message, hence why they hang up and try again. You are the one imposing a strange set of rules to a simple food delivery here. "

You aren't required to support someone when they are being self destructive, especially when it's hard on you.  

With that said if you feel comfortable enough to try to provide her more support thats great as well.  [RAINN](https://www.rainn.org) is a great resource and while I haven't dug through their website they likely have resources specifically for people in your situation who's friends are still in DV relationships that haven't expressed an interest in leaving.

Like I said though, on absolutely don't have to do more than you're comfortable with.  He choice of what to do is up to you and either choice is valid.  At a minimum ensuring that you're there if she ever changes her mind and wants help would be great.  But again, you only do what you feel comfortable doing.

Good luck."

No, he didn't.  He got in trouble in the past for serving minors and stepped up his game to deny service to anyone who could even POSSIBLY have a fake id.  That's not selectively serving the id rule.

Clearly you don't either if you think he was obligated to give you service.  Bars, restuarants, whatever reserving the right to refuse service to anyone at any time.

aue33o,"NTA yes she put in effort to raise you, but what people sometimes don't realise it that *that is the bare minimum for a parent*. She owed you that much or to put you in a situation where you would have that. It is a right, not a priviledge she granted you. Yes, some people don't even get the bare minimum, but that doesn't make her an automatically good person for doing the bare minimum. From what you've said it sounds like she emotionally abused you, or at least was not respective of your needs. Like you said, she was toxic and in my opinion, as soon as a parent says they do not regret something that you tell them they did that hurt you (unless it was absolutely necessary to *your* survival or well-being) then you have no reason to regret cutting them out of your life. My mother was emotionally abusive to me as a child, and the only reason she is in my life right now is because she has shown remorse and is taking actions to change. Even in that scenario you don't owe abusive or neglectful parents anything, but that is the point where I think if it's manageable, it might be a good idea to keep them in your life. Some people love their parents enough to keep them around even if they stay abusive, but it is not morally expected by any means, and I would advise people against it if I knew them well enough personally.

This is my first time commenting on this sub, so I’m sorry if write/format anything wrong! But personally, I believe that the kids’ safety is the most important thing when it comes to matters like this. It sounds like your mom is stubborn, and unwilling to have a reasonable conversation (as with most anti-vaxxers). So I think, while it may be seen as really harsh to show your sister those pictures, it was kind of a necessary evil. I mean, it may not have worked for now, but if it ends up getting your sister vaccinated I think it’s absolutely worth it.

Not to say that you can just show kids potentially traumatizing things in order to get your way—just that, in this specific case, I think it could help them in the long run."
auhxqt,"Sorry but YTA.

I understand where you’re coming from, I don’t have a great income either and was in a similar spot due to my own injury. The thing is though, i think your reaction would just be really reactionary if you told her to return her gifts and give you some money for them instead. The same way you probably wouldn’t appreciate your mom telling you how to spend your own money - give her the same courtesy.

She sees you’re going through a tough spot and wanted to cheer you up. Maybe not in the best way but let her do it for you, even for her own peace of mind.

I can’t help but think to situations where someones gifted clothes for eg. Christmas and you find they’ve returned them. Not exactly the same situation but I’d imagine at least a few people would get a little stab in their heart if they found someone close to them did that - that’s how your Mom would feel.

Enjoy your expensive clothes - keep them for special occasions and even just hang them in the closet to look at - to be reminded that your mom wants nothing but for you to be happy and has got your back 100%.

Intention matters, and you have good intentions (or seem to have).

If you do it, be specially careful to offer it in a way that won't seem too intrusive (it's their family, not yours), and won't sound like ""you can't do this, let me help you"", because she can, just maybe not as money-comfortable as she would like, and that can make her feel very very bad.

And most important of all: **do not offer it in front of the kids**. In case the mother isn't comfortable with that, you would put it in a very uneasy position if the kids hear it.

My advice (in case you decide to invite them): Just don't talk about money at all. Tell her about the videogames you have and that her kids would probably enjoy, talk to her about how she could have an afternoon/night/whatever to herself and to relax and stuff like that. Do **not** bring up stuff like ""your son doesn't have the videogames he wants"" or anything like that.
