aunvul,NTA; he should respect your personal belongings and if he needs something to fidget with get a damn fidget cube or bring his own journals lol 
auny2e,"NTA

Without knowing more about the situation, it’s hard to know whether X was being shady, or overly defensive, or just made a mistake and handled it badly.

I am often the organiser for family/friend trips and it’s harder than people realise to keep track of all the details and to know which decisions to run past the group and which to just go ahead and make. It is possible X just made a bad call this time. Of course, if that’s the case, he should have apologised and done what he could to fix it, not. But he might have been embarrassed, or a bit pissed off that he was being questioned if he’s used to having free reign to do things however he wants."
aunygd,"NTA

Sounds like it's time to buy a $500 car and get out from under their micromanaging thumbs as that seems to be all they have over you.

There's a light at the end of the tunnel, work hard, finish school and you'll have no regrets for how hard you worked to accomplish it when you're living easy in a few years."
auo2qw,"YTA - just because you guys have sex and live together doesn’t mean you are one person. 

You want him to pay for one person right? Because he’s one person.

Yet you want to pay for one person? Even though there’s two people? That’s just.....YTA.

You’re  essentially asking him to pay for one and a half people. Which he shouldn’t have to do. "
auo4q6,"NAH. You are 100% right. You made your choice/plans. Couple 3 wants in on the deal. You expressed your concerns. Frankly, you are nice by passing on some savings to them. Also, as a married person whose wife can't be trusted around an open bar, don't assume the twin beds won't be appreciated lol. "
auo5yz,"NTA - Unless the other person is your dependent, you have the absolutely right to associate or not associate with that person.  Just remember that other can do the same to you and don't be pissed of then that happen.  

With that said, I would say that she is doing you a favor because not you don't have to hid that from your parent and can move on to build a more honest and open relationship with them.  That or find out that they care completely unreasonable.  Either way, I see this as a win win situation for you."
auo6j3,"NTA - she needs to get help or hold her piece. She’s dragging you into her depression spiral and it’s unhealthy for both of you. Giving in to her on this is the same as enabling someone’s addiction. 

Do what’s good for your own mental health man. "
auo8mq,"YTA until he actually acts more irritable etc. He hasn't done anything wrong yet, let him make his own decisions"
auofoq,"YTA

You used someone with a mental handicap for money. You're the worst of the worst.

Nothing else needs to be said here. No one is going to think you're not one of the most terrible people that's ever posted here."
auoiv5,[deleted]
auokie,"NTA. I’d feel that way too. However, she didn’t *technically* do anything wrong because you were broken up. She should still have been upfront with you though."
auonva,"NAH. This is an incredibly shitty situation. I can understand his frustration, but I can also understand your reasoning. It sounds like you guys need to have a calm conversation about what to do with the cat when you're not already fighting. If it were me, I'd suggest re-homing it because of your husband's allergies, but with the cat's behavioral problems, I can see that being difficult. "
auos63,"ESH, not because you slept with your late wife’s sister but because she mentioned having a boyfriend and you did it anyway.   She’s just as guilty too for cheating.   Had she been single I wouldn’t see any issue with this since you’re both consenting adults. "
auosrh,"ESH:

She needs to be reported to actual legal authorities for assault.

You didn't need to stoop to even part of her level. "
auou2s,"NTA, you can still help out with your grandfather.  Just make sure to visit him regularly.  I’d move out and take your mom with you so you can get away from your dad as well. "
auouff,"NTA, also your brother is way abusing his power.  You should consider reporting him even if it further hurts his relationship with you. "
auoy3j,"Infection control nurse here. I won’t comment on the DT but I will say that an annual TB test is likely a state requirement for healthcare providers. Requirement as in law. As a HCW, he may (knowingly or not) be exposed to patients with contagious TB. Having an annual TB test protects both him and the patients he comes in contact with. Starting with a recent baseline is helpful when determining when he might have contracted the infection if he turns up positive. When we hired new employees, we would administer a baseline test on hire if they couldn’t produce written documentation of a test within the previous year. And I mean written documentation from a physician with results (size of skin test reaction, blood test value, etc). 

In addition, if at his next TB test, he turns up positive he may have a hard time claiming the infection is work related if he can’t produce written results of a negative test prior to starting. 

Even though the requirement to be tested is a state law, he won’t be penalized. His medical facilitymwill, however, and he might very well be excluded from clinical and face more repercussions from his school if he’s found to be lying. How could this Happen?  The facility discovers they treated a patient who was diagnosed with TB after the fact. They are legally required to notify, test, and tract anyone HCW who cared for the patient. Your husband is one of them. They call him and need to know the values from and date of his last TB test. He can’t produce a test within the required time frame. Hospital is royally upset with his school because they may get dinged by the state, school is angry because he falsified a document, etc, etc. 

He needs to comply with state law and just get the test. "
auoyoo,"YTA. If he was uncomfortable, you should have stopped. "
aup2pc,NTA... homegirl needs to move on.
aup3ww,NTA- you sound like a great mate please find some that deserve you
aup66c,"ESH

You're acting at least as crazy as she is. You hate this girl, and you're also acting like you're obsessed with her. It's **weird**. Instead of trashing her to her face and then obsessing over whether she's okay, try just leaving her alone. Like a normal person."
aup68r,"Nah - Honestly? He dont sound that into you, iv pulled the ""oh i bought you a present but lost it"" before, because i didn't want to waste my money on her when i knew it wasnt long term, i could be wrong but thats how it seems"
aup7id,"So, this could just be a cultural difference thing, but I find it strange that your parents have enrolled you in these courses when you're 19 without asking you first and that you don't seem to need. What age do people in India normally go to university? Could you just be doing that instead? 

&#x200B;

I think I'm ultimately going to go with NAH, because I understand that your parents are doing this in your best interests. But if these classes are redundant, stressful, and ultimately meaningless, I don't blame you for not wanting to go. However, if you don't come clean to them about this, then YTA, since they're basically flushing money down the drain at this point. "
aupark,"NAH (Except for her cheating on her husband, which is an asshole thing to do, but seems a bit tangential to most of this.) You are allowed to decide someone isn't a good friend for you and to distance yourself from her. She and her husband are allowed to run their relationship in the manner the two of them agree upon (so the open relationship part is asshole-free). If somebody grows into a person you're not compatible with, then that's an asshole-free situation where it makes sense to stop being close."
aupasc,"YTA.   You’re not her father and you need to back off.   Unless she’s sliding into these exes dm’s, you’re overreacting.  "
aupi0v,This post gave me brain cancer.
aupia0,"NTA And I really hate non-therapists, non-psychologists who know a tiny shred about desensitization and then try to apply it entirely wrong and blame their victims for getting hurt. They work with kids; they have a responsibility to be a bit better educated on these matters than that. If they had just copped to the fact that they messed up and didn't think about it, it wouldn't be as bad.But they tried to justify their mistake, which really is not okay."
aupjll,"NAH

Her heart was in the right place. I'm sure she doesn't understand why you're frustrated, but you know, shit happens. This should blow over quick. Just don't be a dick about it. She probably realizes she made a few mistakes by now."
aupl35,"NTA, any stable relationship is built on communication.  If you didn’t tell her how you felt, you’d end up repressing it until it became a huge issue.

Just because you’re the man, it doesn’t mean that you don’t deserve to be treated to spontaneous random acts of love.  If she’s switched off completely,  you need to really dig deep and make sure that this relationship is working."
auppny,"ESH He was out of line trying to lecture you or talk down to you without knowing your situation, but being that he's a neighbor that seemingly has a good enough relationship with your parents to come by and chat, you might have made things awkward for them by telling him to fuck off."
aupqae,NTA. A living wage surcharge is tacky.
aupu7j,NTA. He's a shit head on a power trip. Good job on ignoring without provoking.
auq1mr,"NAH. 
I see both sides here as in todays world people expect constant commuication and it can be exhausting keeping up.
On the other hand when you message someone, they read it and don't respond it can make you feel like your bothering them and they arent important enough to respond to "
auq48u,"NTA. The guy is a dedicated employee, hard-working, and is probably about 50% of the reason people love the restaurant. You need good food, obviously, but good service is just as important. Sounds like your friend is just jealous. Which is ridiculous, because (as you said) he's probably making considerably less than her husband. "
auq5td,NTA - It his fault for not promptly replying to your inquiry.
auq6ws,"YTA. Grow up. It's not your day, wear the jacket for the pictures and ceremony and then take it off. This problem is minuscule 

Edit:  its AMAZING how you are arguing with everyone about this issue despite a unanimous agreement that you're a flaming asshole here. You have got to be a troll. Or the studpiest person to grace this sub in a hot second. "
auq7u8,"NTA - You can't be an asshole for losing attraction to a person for any reason. However read below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She actually does sound like wifey material, but she's trying hard to stay the tomboyish girl you originally got with. You may want to have a talk and make it clear that you're being serious and are interested in a more emotionally open relationship with her.  If she completely rebuffs the idea and shuts you down, then hey, at least you tried."
auqay7,ESH - Don't escalate situations like this. It'll bite you in the ass(hole).
auqbe7,"NTA 

Disabled people are no more entitled to your friendship than anyone else. "
auqeia,"NTA.

...please tell me your friends do refer to you as Mooselands."
auqiur,"NTA - I wouldn't have gone to prom with them, either.

I do have an INFO, though - what exactly weighs on you about this? It seems like everybody in the story, including the mom, thinks the girls suck, which makes these seem more like a validation post."
auql4q,How is this NAH? Snap chatting while driving is not an asshole move?
auqm01,"If you live in a country where tipping is customary then YTA. Usually a $1 per drink tip is appropriate or a typical 15-20% if you have a tab running. What you're arguing is essentially the same as not tipping a waitress because all she does is bring you food. 

Whether that's how it should be or not is a different discussion but you should be tipping as it's customary and expected. "
auqquk,"NTA at all. That's incredibly shady and suspicious behavior, and you would probably be an idiot for not suspecting something was up. If what happened happened the way you said it did, there's a very high probability that she's lying to you and probably cheating on you. I'm sorry, friend. :("
auqrec,NTA. This is a prime example of a white lie. 
auqwfh,This is truly the dumbest post of the day. I apologize to any other post I called dumb today. I didn't know how high the bar would be set.

aur0km,"NTA

YOu have every right to leave a relationship if you are unhappy with the actions of your partner - and her being a mean drunk falls into that category."
aur1wi,"YTA. It's your sister's wedding. She can invite whomever she wants. Grow up. You'll be there with J and I'm sure many other people you're fond of, so just hang out with them and leave A be. Live and let live."
aur2oj,"Nta people just dont want to listen and then think tr hey can get away with it. You good.
"
aur2sn,NTA He decided to have you not the other way around. Thus a parent has responsibilities to a child not the other way around. It’s honestly your decision what you want to do. 
aur5n8,NTA. Companies actually encourage whistle-blowing.
aura9i,"Sweetheart. You are being sexually harassed. You have been sexually assaulted. Please, for your safety report him!"
aurdz5,"NAH, but it does indeed sound like your BF has a problem with porn and should probably address it in some way. IMO watching that much porn that frequently and in those settings is not normal. If he does have an addiction its not really his fault, and you certainly have the right to be uncomfortable with things even if you weren't before. I say NAH but it would be best to talk this out and communicate that you are now uncomfortable with this, otherwise you have the potential to become TA."
aure6c,"NAH. Of course you’re going to be concerned for him as he’s your friend, but he obviously has his own way of coping. It may not be the most constructive coping mechanism, but it may well be his only coping mechanism. Make it clear to him that you’re there for him but ultimately, you’ve got to let him do what he needs to, otherwise you risk becoming the asshole."
aurf6v,"NTA, you'd literally be way more of an asshole for saying that it had to do with her sister"
aurffe,NTA. Jasmine should have at least given you a heads up the first time for sure. Could you talk to Jasmine about it?
aurhkm,YTA if it was YOUR horse you should have gone home and taken care of having the poor horse put down. Your mother said repeatedly she was uncomfortable with it.
aurijh,"NTA There are several red flags here. She could well be abusive and is certainly a bad idea. That said, strongly advising people to break up with an abuser almost never works. It's well intentioned, and I wish it were that simple, but it usually isn't. You can be supportive of him. You can encourage him to use protection. You can encourage him to maintain contacts with his other friends. You can listen to him when he wants to talk about his relationship. You can ask him if he's happy. But he'll have to figure out for himself that she's a bad idea. It's one of the most frustrating things in life, watching somebody do something self-destructive, but not having the power to stop them. I am sorry. I hope this works out okay."
aurjur,"NTA - Hes only mad you're not spending your money on him. He's TA in this situation, & quite frankly you shouldn't be putting up with it. "
aurkgg,"NTA- being scrupulous is not a sin, I wouldn't care to use my siblings' fork, but I would never get mad if one of them rejected mine, there is just no point. "
aurkgv,"YTA for her saying that her Mom being her best friend and knitting together killed it for you. That's awesome.

NTA for splitting asking for the bill to be split. "
aurp6k,"NTA

It's kind of considered common courtesy to let your guests know beforehand if they have to pay. It was a really dickish move for your friend to send you basically an invoice for the night when you had no idea that you would have to pay AND your friend knows you're tight on cash right now. "
aurq14,"Sounds like you did the right thing to me. Toxic friendships are hard. High school drama is hard. 
Good luck to you! Just remember this is only temporary. They will pick on someone else eventually.  Kudos to you for standing up for yourself!"
aurrpt,"ESH. You for intentionally stirring the pot to ""get it off your chest,"" and her for engaging with you about it when it was clearly an inappropriate subject for conversation aside from telling you ""No. You can't talk to me about that, that's inappropriate to talk about with me, and I don't want to walk about it."" *Also* her for even bringing up the conversation while she was in a relationship.

I feel bad for her boyfriend."
aursly,NTA - he takes his computer to shower with him? Definitely something to hide. 
aurztd,"NTA. Wtf, your friend is over dramatic and ridiculous. "
aus20d,"You didn't ""make"" her break up with him. She's not a child and you're not her parent. You screamed at him and called him names. She broke up with him. So NTA for that. 

But next time, instead of verbally abusing someone, you can choose to simply lay out the terms of residency and evict them if they violate the terms such as rent or groceries."
aus37b,"NTA

She is quite irresponsible and needs someone to talk sense into her. It's her choice to get pregnant, but it's damn shitty of her to do it knowing she can't afford a child, is expecting the grandparents to help, and would use it to trap her boyfriend into proposing to her.

I would be the asshole to let the boyfriend know the plan, friendship be damned. "
aus3mq,">I agreed the cats home would be upstairs

Your Cat attacking new cats in environment.

Pets are family, not temporary accessories. 

&#x200B;

YTA.

give up the cat, give up the dog too.... cause you don't deserve a pets unconditional love. "
aus9cf,"NTA if he's ok with it, but buy him a beer so he doesn't feel hard done by, friends who will drive 40 for cards are worth it."
aus9pz,"YTA. It sounds like you lack self-awareness of how your behavior impacts others....so an unintentional asshole, but an asshole nonetheless. Luckily, it's curable! Just stop whistling when you're in public places (and also: don't talk on speakerphone unless you're driving or are alone, and don't play music on a boombox while shopping). "
aus9uw,YTA for playing games. Learn to communicate. 
ausd9p,"NTA

Talk to the dean and see if something can be worked out. Also mention how unprofessional your Prof. was with all the yelling.

FYI this is why it's important to have email records."
ausj49,"NTA. I hope your friend gets the help he needs, as his mom sounds like she isn't going to provide that."
auslak,"NTA

Your sister sounds bat shit from your stories. You have the right to treat your grown sister how you want based off her actions. You do still live under your parent's roof and care so maybe you should have a deeper conversation, especially if you feel unsafe. "
ausm1m,"NTA

If even half of what you said in this post is accurate, he deserves it.  What's more, you may want to file for a restraining order against him with those threats.  "
ausrjm,"NTA

You helped them in the past and offered them an option to keep a phone that was risk averse for you personally. It's not your wife's responsibility to bankroll her mom's bad choices. You've offered help and hopefully your wife sees that.

Be careful with your personal information. Make sure there's no way they can open any accounts in you or your wife's names. I doubt she would try to steal your identity but being proactive on your end is a good idea."
austca,"NTA - sounds like your SO wants to be Insta-famous and wants you to boost her esteem for likes. Seems very superficial and needy. 
Honestly this is a huge red flag in a relationship 🚩"
austjt,NTA.  You're being financially responsible.  Good job.

she’s not trying to help, she’s trying to shill her product and possibly recruit your mom as her downline. Family shouldn’t scam family."
ausxks,[deleted]
ausyg5,"YTA, but not to any major degree. Ask her if there's anything you can take off her hands in return. Or just do it yourself and learn. That's what school's for, after all.

aut87c,"NAH Make a Wish isn't just for dying kids; it's also for kids who have to have their childhood disrupted by serious medical care. You're eligible because it is meant for kids like you too. I'm really glad your medical condition isn't worse, but it's still unfortunate you have had to go through all that you have. So, you can see if you can get a wish, and if you get it, enjoy it with no guilt."
aut8ff,"NTA

She is basically a bad roommate at this point and you don't let your bad roommate ever borrow your car just because they want it.

She didn't even come pick you up from a car accident!

autg1k,"NTA. It was kind of vindictive but it’s your coat, you’re allowed to take it back. "
autggn,"NTA. ADD doesn't excuse him going past your physical boundaries. Those are your most immediate, personal, and intimate boundaries. Neither him, nor anyone else, has the right to violate those boundaries without *very* good reason (e.g. you commit a crime and have to be handcuffed and pat down, or you're in the middle of a medical emergency and someone is trying to save your life.)

I know a lot of people struggling with ADHD/ADD. Just about none of them have issues respecting the boundaries of their SO's. It's not an unrealistic expectation, it's an incredibly important one. It's your body, you get to say who touches it, for what reason, and at what time. Don't settle for less."
autkql,"NTA, but at the end of the day its not your business who he dates.  You expressed your objection privately to someone else and it came back to him, I don't really feel like that counts as butting in."

If you're a minor, it is absolutely their responsibility to ensure you don't grow up into a giant douchebag that is going to wind up living on their sofa and eating all of their puffy cheetos.  That includes checking in on your grades.

autz88,"NTA

Your dad uninviting you on the pretense that you’re expected to suddenly become besties with his wife is ridiculous. My parents are divorced, and I know for sure that the moment a romantic interest of theirs pissed me off, they’d be out the door. Unmarried parents need to put their kids first, and your dad isn’t doing that. I don’t blame you for being upset with him; I would be, too."
auu5xk,NTA. You should bring this to HR immediately. She is either ignorant to your disorder or purposely harassing you.
auu8l9,"NTA. Ask him if he'd change his surname for you. If not, why not? Then throw that same reason back at him (if it's 'because I'm a man', then he needs to go back to the 13th century). What you do with your identity is up to you, and no-one else."
auub5r,"NTA. You're not morally, ethically or legally wrong here. They didn't want a pup, nor the responsibility of one, so they gave it away. Their issue, not yours."
auucgs,"NTA. You're uncomfortable with the idea, and have told him that. He needs to get a job and/or stop mooching off people"
auufon,NTA and it sounds like your mother is projecting her shame at failing to raise her other daughter to be better

auuxad,NTA - I do this. We can be cool or whatever. But once the trust is gone I’m done with it and it won’t ever come back.
auv01k,"NTA. Just because you left notes/contacted the office doesn't mean that you need to talk to them face to face in order for them to quiet down (you also have valid reasons to not talk face to face). They're being assholes for not ""growing a pair"" and respecting neighbors."
auv22n,"NTA, but understand she seems stressed. You offered her help, and make sure to follow through on that.

auvibn,"NAH. A dog can be really overwhelming, especially to first time owners. It’s reasonable to be uncomfortable. 

However, your mom also has every right to get the dog, and it sounds like she isn’t at all trying to force responsibility of taking care of the dog on you. 

IMO if you do not like spending time with the dog but feel like it needs more attention than it’s currently getting, then you should bring it up to your mom/the rest of the family and see if alternative arrangements can be made to keep the pup entertained during the day. "
auvkp1,"ESH

He's an asshole for trying to control your behavior by ""punishing you"".

You're an asshole for lying and sneaking around when you know this is something that really bothers him.

Both of you are allowed to have deal breakers in relationships. He can not want to date a smoker. You can not want to be with someone that disapproves of smokers. 

But until you guys openly and honestly communicate what you're ok with in a partner and what vices you're going to choose to indulge in as adults, you're both being assholes."

NTA, my friend. My boyfriend would have pushed me out the door and even given me some money for a drink on him. It's only because you made her feel like she wasn't the most important that she's pissed about. She wasn't sick. I'm glad you went and made use of the tickets otherwise what a huge waste of time and money. You showed her how much you wanted her to go, asked and asked and asked. Not once did she ask you not to go. 

The fact she got mad you gave the ticket to someone else just screams 'WHY DIDNT YOU STAY WITH ME INSTEAD' - not 'I'm sick and really can't go'. When someone is genuinely sick they won't wanna leave their pyjamas and house in any state. It's a total ego knock that you chose the concert over her. You're NTA - tell her to move on from it, it's been over 2 months already."

You didn't ever tell him you threw the food to the dogs, so he has no idea it was thrown out. But now you're conjecturing that he was angry because he ""cared about"" the food and didn't want it thrown out.

If this is the case then your father is probably just angry about dog behaviour and you are a mild asshole for letting the dogs get disciplined and punished for something the poor pooches didn't even do. "

But death has a way of changing our perspective of people; making our viewpoint gentler and more forgiving.

My high school crush, a very good friend, died on a college graduation trip. I had spent four years happily over him, if anything kind of thinking he's a very mild jerk, and generally getting myself into a good, confident place. When he died, we were all devastated. And all the sudden I realized all of the things I should've apologized for, that he wasn't really a jerk, etc etc. I had spent four years either never thinking of him, or thinking of him in a pretty dry, dispassionate way, and then he died, and my perspective did change. It didn't make me fall in love with him again or anything. It just made me view him in a more forgiving way.

The question at the end of the post is way different than the question on the title. I answered the one int he title.

If the conversation leads to you breaking up it's not the same that if you break up with her because of this.

You say you love her, been 2 years together, love taking care of her and spending time and talking to her every day. Yet you would rather have sex with other people and are willing to break up over this. Then you more likely don't actually love her.

Being attracted to others is very normal, and the feeling of ""I was so much better when I was single"" is too. But considering breaking up with someone you claim to be great with, and someone you claim to love.. Meh, asshole, sorry.

3. Talk to your ex girlfriend after your wife, and make it clear you are not trying to steal your kid, and you just want to be a small part of her life and don’t want to supplant her current “dad”.  What happens next depends on how your ex feels but hopefully you don’t have to get legal involvement.

Her behavior in response to your crying is a major red flag for your relationship, as it shows that she probably believes that men shouldn't cry and should instead bottle up their feelings (and your friend is an asshole too for the same reason). This is INCREDIBLY INCORRECT AND HARMFUL. This is what's known as the popular buzzword ""toxic masculinity"", or the notion that men have to be as masculine as possible all of the time, and that any expression of emotion is a sign of weakness and vulnerability that means you're less of a man. DO NOT BELIEVE THAT HORSE SHIT. Men can still be men and cry when they need to. Women can still be women and be tough then they need to. You went through some rough stuff in your past, and it's perfectly understandable if a reminder like this would cause you to break down and have a much-needed cry.

Your feelings of wanting to give up and stop banging your head against the wall are completely valid and understandable.

She's not TA because she has her own demons to battle, and possibly a mental illness like you said.

You didn't say you're going to cut off contact, but you're just going to stop trying to help with her lifestyle.  I think maybe you should do that for a while, to gather your energy, and then approach her about it one more time, in a very frank manner.  Instead of hints and suggestions, just straight up ask her if she is OK with her life, where she can't do anything with her grandchild and lives in such filth that you are loathe to visit.  If she is not happy with that, ask her how you can help.  If she doesn't know, seek out help from a third party (church, doctor, therapist, etc.).  If she is content with it, truly content and not just ""I don't want to be a burden"" content, then I think you just have to let her be, like you planned on.

It seems like part of the issue is that your financial agreements are a bit ad hoc, which means it’s a judgement call how much discretionary income you each have and what you spend it on.

You did the right thing 100%. As someone who works with kids around age 10 it’s incredible to see the effect being exposed to these games has on them.

From what I can read in the subtext of what you write, you have a hard time fitting in, and even when you are with friends you feel alone and like an impostor. This is very common, especially if you have self-esteem issues. You read things into what people say that might not even be there.

No one here is an asshole. If they didn't want to be with you, they wouldn't.

avdyiu,"NTA at all. My sister pulled this same crap on me, so I know exactly what type of person you're talking about. You've given her countless free babysitting nights and sacrificed your own social life in the process to watch a kid that you're ultimately not responsible for, and she's being ungrateful. I love my niece to death, just as I'm sure you love your nephew to pieces, but you are going to have to tell your sister and your parents (she turned my mom against me on the issue, too, so again, had to comment because I know what type of guilt tripping they're laying on you right now) that your nephew is not your son, he is your sisters son. Watching him, or finding someone to watch him, is her responsibility and hers alone, not yours. You clearly plan on watching your own baby when he/she is born (btw congrats on your new bundle of joy), and its not your fault your sister didn't plan her pregnancy like you did. 

Its gonna be harsh, but you have to put your foot down because she is taking advantage of your kindness and exploiting your love for your nephew to get free labor out of you - and yes, childcare IS labor. Even if you weren't pregnant or experiencing complications, its still not your obligation to put your life on hold every time your sister decides she doesn't want to watch her kid or pay a sitter. Make it clear that when you do watch your nephew, you do it as a FAVOR, not an obligation she can just expect from you."

Zoning out in your own little world playing games and drinking beer feels fun, but the society that created that fun bubble you're enjoying had to come from somewhere, and needs to be protected. It didn't just spring up from a vacuum! Taking a few minutes every day to engage in the broader world is not a lot of work, and forming educated opinions about what's happening around you is part of living a full and well-rounded life.

You also said ""she wanted me to give her all of my tuna and salmon and I eat the rice"" but you mentioned earlier that you had different kinds of seafood to eat so I'm not sure where the disconnect is there and it sounds like you're exaggerating what she wants to make yourself look better. Also, rolls are absolutely not the same as a plain piece of fish on top of some rice. There are multiple fillings to a roll. Based on the tone and wording in this post I highly doubt you weren't passive-aggressive about ordering her food since you're so dismissive of her, and there's no reason to be happy about your husband spending more money and then blaming you for it (despite him being the one that made the mistake) and expecting you to be happy about it.

That being said, the reaction of not speaking to you is childish and immature, *especially* over not eating the dinner she wanted. Healthy couples recognize when an issue isn't worth fighting over and communicate when it is; instead, she probably recognizes this is stupid and not worth fighting over but doesn't want to get over it so she's just sulking."

Im not talking about a weekend over Christmas or during a wedding, those situations you bite your tongue and smile and nod but for going away on a vacation together? No way.

&#x200B;

He is an asshole, and im actually leaning towards your GF's family being in the wrong for enabling him being an asshole just to keep the peace. "
avh2f7,"NAH in my opinion. Your wife is already on anxiety meds and is probably having a hard time with how frustrated she feels by simple sounds. Misophonia is a very hard thing to overcome and she should talk to the doctor who prescribed the anxiety meds to see what they could help with. You're not the asshole either, you just want to eat and it must be frustrating that you cant eat around her."
avh3ft,"NAH. I think it’s good that you care about your partner’s health and well-being. That alone doesn’t make you an asshole. As long as the drinking is not affecting his behaviour, he also isn’t an asshole. "
avh3gz,"NAH, why don't you show your partner the care routine and they can do it themselves if they want it done so badly?"
avh838,"NTA, your body your choice."
avh84n,"NAH. He needs to find a support group, or talk to a therapist. Maybe that will help take some pressure off of you, and give him some catharsis. "
avhah5,"NTA. 

Lol. That's their bad. You could tell them so you aren't associated with them anymore though. But you're not an asshole just because they're fuckin idiots. "
avhb79,"NTA. 

Lauren is a C U Next Tuesday type. And her SIL should mind her own fuckin' business. "
avhcd7,"NAH. However I would recommend you ask her, rather than tell her. Be prepared that she might say no!"
avhe8x,"ESH

She already got in trouble, what did you stand to gain by rubbing it in, other than being funny to your equally-shitty friends?

She did cheat, though, and that's some BS."
avhfse,NAH. You have a right to know more about your ancestry. Just respect his wishes and don’t share anything with him or about him. 
avhnv6,"YTA. The first half of your comment was serious so the last sentence absolutely doesn’t read as sarcasm if that was your intention.  Even if it was... I don’t understand how “women are emotional idiots” is sarcasm. It’s not funny, you didn’t supply an anecdote, and you’re just confirming the woman’s frustration that men are unsympathetic and rude. How did that line add to the conversation at all?"
avhomo,"NTA

You're completely right to be upset with your father. He is being too dependent on you, and that is threatening your ability to be an independent adult. I would sit down with him, and have a talk about where your relationship will go from here, because in its current state, it's not sustainable. "
avhs7x,"Nta but maybe you aren't ready for sex if you are embarrassed by it all. Also, if he's horny he can jerk himself off, you're not his sex doll. 

*let the downvotes begin*  "
avhx55,NAH. Both opinions have equal merit. 
avhzbu,"NTA surveying is a science, based on math and geography, not feelings. Unless you have reason to believe that the survey company is conspiring to 'steal' land based on race, this is such a stupid thing to be fighting over. I also feel like it does a disservice to actual racism when people blame every little thing that didn't go their way on their race. There is plenty of actual injustice in the world without creating some where none exists. "
avi0st,"NTA - I don't understand why she would even be upset. She didn't have to go, and you got to go. Everyone wins here. And if she wasn't ready today, she probably won't be ready tomorrow before school."
avi3jv,I don’t think so. P and I are strictly friends & J and I aren’t in contact enough for him to develop feelings. He also is constantly fucking some girl so ya know 
avi3rn,"NTA. Your money, your choice. "
avi4oo,"NAH. You're allowed to be annoyed by the lack of feedback; however, if her injury was very traumatic it could have been a long recovery. You were alerted that there would be a delay. "
avifzt,"YTA

I thought about this one for awhile and weighed between YTA for leaving her in the dark about the true reason you’re dumping her and NTA for how she fabricated what she ‘really’ looked like.

You are an incredible asshole for going through with sleeping with her when you had 0 interest. You basically used her as lodging because you were in a foreign country. You basically encouraged her to think that she had something real with you despite her fabrications.

If you hadn’t slept with her and just hung out and flew home I’d say you are NTA as you’d just didn’t connect and she misled you.

But toying with someone’s feelings because you don’t have the balls to say what you think and further make her believe something is real is a shit move. 

You owe her an explanation.

"
avig1r,"NTA

Go for it, pal.  Your Aunt is an asshole for trying to make an important event in YOUR life all about HER.  If they want to come to big events, they need to be there for the other, smaller, boring, day-to-day events too.  "
avilmo,"NAH - If she were actively dealing with infertility issues, then it may be a bit insensitive. Someone having children (even step children) does not make them unable to understand the abortion process and reasons why someone would choose that. If your friend is pro-choice, then it should be fine to seek her support. If she is pro-life, then I'd recommend looking elsewhere. "
avivsg,"You're NTA and clearly in the right here, but let me give you some advice as someone who has been in your shoes. Just do the dishes. Their behavior isn't going to improve and you don't want to live in a nasty house. Just do the cleaning, even if you already do the lion's share, and accept that this is just how things are. You'll be happier, I promise. "
avizqk,"NAH- I am white, too, but doesn’t associate chinese people with pc games. I can understand your sight, but he wasn’t trying to be offensive, I guess. "
avj3br,"NTA

Your job isn't to make her feel better when she played her cards and the flop didn't go her way. By saying ""maybe if my situation doesn't change, if i move closer, etc"" she's just trying to give you enough hope to keep you hooked. That's fucked up and manipulative. It sounds like she needs to mature a bit and understand that decisions have consequences, i.e. she leaves you for him, it doesn't work out so she wants to go back to you. 

People make mistakes but she was playing Pokemon with you, keeping you in her back pocket in case her primary choice wasn't correct. No need to be a jerk toward her (not saying you are, just saying don't become one) but no need to rescue her from her own adult choices. "
avj3hw,"NTA - you're right, the rule with international destination weddings is that you don't get to feel butthurt when people can't go. I'd wager the whole reason for the local party is to compensate for the very fact that people can't go.

&#x200B;

Your friend must be a real pill if he's legitimately keeping a shitlist about who's not able to come."
avj43f,"YTA

Calling food baby like ""this is my baby"" is a lot different than applying it to a human being who has already said that they don't like it being applied to them.   Regardless of if you think it's cringe or not, your bf has asked you to stop using it on him."
avj4qn,"NAH. But please don't ever use the phrase ""sexy time"" again. Gag."
avj56l,"Info -  Outside of a “hi thanks for coming” are you going to be forced to interact? If not, YTA.  Don’t create drama for something so minor.  "
avj9a6,"NTA - the bus can still hurt OTHER people, even if children aren't on it. Send that shit in. "
avja30,"NTA. Can I say, though, that once you said your “close friend” asked you to come and “take pictures of her and her friends” it became pretty obvious that she doesn’t consider you a friend the same way you consider her one? You weren’t wrong to expect basic human courtesy, but it seems like you may be wrong to expect it from her."
avjbes,YTA. I think you know this and doubt you really need it explained to you. 
avjd1n,"NTA on cleaning the table..

but everything else.. wtf?"
avjgat,NTA you totally should have gotten a refund. If the conditions were so bad you had to leave and stay somewhere else you deserve a refund. 
avjgv7,"Put in an anonymous note. Explain you don't want to get them in trouble, but outline your concerns. If nothing changes then go to the front desk and make an anonymous complaint. Sounds like you won't be the first. "
avjqo0,NTA. I think it would be nice for her to hear she has support during a hard time. 
avjwsx,NTA your step-grandma sounds very manipulative and i wonder if she's in the early stages of dementia? This isn't normal behavior for someone.
avk0qc,[deleted]
avkbjp,YTA - You expect *them* to take personal responsibility for *your* vape clouds?
avkcuy,"NAH, you just don't know you're different."
avkecb,NTA. You need to set your own financial boundaries and priorities. 
avkgzc,"NTA. You made a deal, he didn't live up to it. I would work with your landlord to figure out the cost though and see how much of it could come out of his portion of the security deposit.

&#x200B;

NAL but if he signed the lease with you and refuses to pay for the damage, that sounds like a good case to me."
avklx2,"NTA - people actually believe this bro code bullshit? Everyone involved is adults, so fucking act like it. This friend is an idiot."
avkqqp,"NTA but your plan will 100% backfire when they inevitably find out. Make something up like you are trying to have some romantic time with A significant other if you have one, or make something else up that you wont get caught in a lie. "
avksoq,"NAH, don’t ‘ask him to be discreet’, rather inform him of the difference in culture and/or maybe ask for a teachers assistance. "

avkvd1,"NAH

That's a tough one. Your sister only turns 18 once. Your BF's grandmother only gets one funeral. I'd put the sister above your BF's grandmother,  because it's your sister. You'll still meet the family at the BBQ swim party. 


That being said, if it was just the concert, sell the tickets on craiglist and go to the funeral. It's not Beck's farewell tour, they'll have other concerts. "
avkzx2,"YTA and that's abuse. Whether or not it 'worked', that's abuse."
avl2pz,"NTA

There are people you see every now and then and there are people you can live with on a day to day basis. Tyler is the former and you can't bring him into a group with a high risk of affecting the group dynamic. Let him be upset. If he doesn't get over it, that's on him. But it's not worth the headache of putting up with Tyler if he has another ""falling out"" with one of your suite-mates. "
avl455,"NTA- If an Asian woman walked up to you and swung open your car door would you be afraid? 

If a white woman swung your door open would you be afraid?

Do you not get scared by black people in anywhere that’s not a dark parking lot? 

If you said yes to all of these you’re most likely not a racist.  She shouldn’t have swung your door open, even just knocking on the window would be less aggressive. "
avl7j8,"NTA. What the fuck is wrong with that dude? People get cut off every day. It sucks. It's usually an honest mistake. It's not his job to follow you to your school and yell at you. That's creepy. That's threatening. That's not okay. He has some problems, don't feel like it's your fault he blew up over an honest mistake. Normal people *don't do that*. "
avl84l,Yta. Try slayer instead 
avl8ge,"YTA

You are such an asshole, dude.  There's pranks and then there's poking a bear - and it sounds like your brother's gf was a bear that was just coming out of hibernation with a serious craving for a proposal.  

> ""I didn't make her freak out""

No, you just gave her false hope when you knew she had been itching to be proposed to.   "
avlazt,Shoulda put that in your op I guess.

Not your dog not your problem"
avlgma,"You are missing the fact that he is a selfish douche and you need to find someone better to be in your life.

NTA"
avli74,"YTA. Not due to taking action to get what you need, but for your chosen method.

Nowhere do you say you had actually told him that you needed him to STFU about non-project related chat. You danced around it and decided on a whim to toss your toys out of the pram. 

I'm not excusing his behaviour, or even saying that there was anything wrong with it. Inside another group sitting ten feet away, he might have fit in perfectly. People and groups function in different ways to get to the end result. You are the one who had a problem with it, not him, and you should have let him know respectfully in a businesslike manner much earlier. If he was unable to meet you halfway (note: there is no need for him to do more than that as your way isn't necessarily the right way), at *that* point there was a need to begin action. "
avlitw,"NTA - you went to a meeting for a sport you have previous participated in. Is she going to complain when you go to practices, too?

I'm sorry about strict parents making it difficult to spend time together, but this is something you personally want to invest in. Sounds like she's getting dangerously close to wanting complete control of your time, which is not healthy in a relationship."
avlkz4,"NAH.

Sometimes people are incompatible. As pretentious or terrible as it sounds, intelligence can make or break a relationship. You need an intellectual, emotional, and physical bond with your so. One person will almost always be more intelligent, so seriously consider your feelings and try to ask her about it. "
avll8e,"NTA

You have every right to have a bed and bedroom to sleep in (One would think that your GF would rather have a boyfriend sleeping in the bed next to her and not her sister, but apparently not)

"
avlsy3,"NTA 

Does she pull things like this often? "
avlwuu,"YTA: driving isn’t a competition. There are rules of the road for a reason, and allowing people to zipper merge is for safety, not fairness. 

If you can’t set aside your ego on the road, don’t drive. You’re a danger to others and yourself. "
avlzhi,NTA dude it's okay to break up with someone over incompatibility. If she's asexual a relationship between you two won't work out
avm0vf,"NTA. From the title I thought maybe you are teens so it would be a reasonable request but both of you are adults. I wouldn't bother to come at all, but that's just me. Also, I wonder how she will pack 15+ people there without people sleeping on floors/outside/3 in one bed"
avm4pn,"Except we have no indication whatsoever that they're going to, the person above you asked ""what if the kids *thought* they were having sex?"" I'm sure these kids have parents who share bedrooms, some of those kids probably even have sleepovers while the parents are asleep in the same bed. It's not really different. Assuming OPMom is a sex maniac or doesn't have some sense of decorum while kids are in the house is a little unfair."
avm71x,"YTA - you know you RSVP to weddings and that your promised attendance costs the bride and groom money, right? Plus it sounds like other people have paid for you to attend... 

I get it sucks, but you made a promise. I agree with your dad though - if you can ensure that your poor planning doesn’t cost money, then you can fix the situation. But likely, I don’t see that being the case for your cousin "
avm80t,NTA. You have every right to not listen/read what others say if you don't like it.
avme7e,"YTA, your mum isn't annoyed that you didn't do your chores or spent too much time on the computer. She is annoyed that you questioned her authority over something so petty. You live in their house, eating their food, using their electricity and unless you want to start paying rent you need to live by their rules and boundaries. Apologise and negotiate better terms like an adult, don't act like a child or they will treat you like a child. Offer to take on additional chores or other help in exchange for your computer privileges back."
avmetr,"NTA

I've had this happen to me before as well. Got a set of skull shaped shot glasses that came in completely shattered. Usually things like this are easy to replace but it has to be done by the buyer. Considering it was a gift exchange I'm sure your Santa would want to know since they were trying to get you something you enjoy."
avmiuy,NAH but I don’t think the two of you are compatible based on these interactions.
avmizi,NAH you guys just arent compatible. 
avmj04,"NTA. Your weed, your choice"
avmkkn,"NTA, this person is basically a stranger.  Its unfair for her to want it to immediately turn into a mother/child relationship.   That said you might actually enjoy getting to know her a bit and finding out a little about where you came from (genetically)."
avmmf4,"NTA, shift leader said you could, then he backtracked. You're allowed at least a 30 minute break"
avmmrf,"YTA. Your wife and mother have a strained relationship, although you have been standing by your wife she obviously wants as little to do with your mother as possible.

I don’t think she’s being petty. It’s not as though she doesn’t want any of the photos that she takes getting to your parents. She’s fine with you sending the pictures. If she sends photos of your kid to you while you’re at work just how hard is it for you to forward them.

Personally I think if you get your wife to cave on this it’s going to be a case of be careful what you wish for. Your wife is low contact for a reason, expect there to be more tension and blowups if you’re demanding she increases contact. 

To be honest it seems like the easiest thing to do would be to encourage your parents to get a social media account just for the purpose of seeing the photos that she posts. "
avmpzl,"NTA.  You don't owe anyone your time.  It sounds like you're not comfortable around him, so don't meet up.  You have no social obligation to meet up.

If you're really that down about your personality, think about going to therapy.  We can all do with improved self esteem.

Edit in regards to your update: You're only 17.  This guy is predatory and manipulative.  Please, please consider blocking him and ending all contact."
avmszx,"I don't think you would be an asshole, but it sounds like you recognize what a symbolic gesture of good will it would be if you asked her to be part of your wedding party. If she can be consistently civil, I think it's worth a shot. You might regret it down the road, seeing pictures of your wedding and bridesmaids without her in them."
avmx1e,NTA you’re trying to make sure your kid learns bodily autonomy from a young age. No shame in that game. 
avn1jv,"YTA- dude.... I don’t even know where to begin with this. He is the same person you connected with.... now you just know more about him. Let me ask you, when you pictured having a friend like this who was straight, why did his sexuality matter? What is the reasoning behind that logic? If you’re having thoughts like this you don’t support the LGBTQ community like you think you do. "
avn228,"NTA, but it sounds like your fiance may be.  Does he have a reason to expect that you may be cheating?  Does he often accuse you of cheating?"

avn536,NTA. Your friend is being very vague about the details of the party. It seems like $40 for three hours access and only one drink per person is too steep and you’re entitled to clarification.
avn5ug,"NTA 

He’s 40 and playing these dumb mind games? Should dump him while you’re at it"
avn66p,NTA. Yuuuuuuge redflag that he tried to make you feel like shit and tell you he feels unloved for you choosing to prepare for an exam instead of spending time with him. That’s emotional manipulation and it always has the potential to worsen. Be wary with him in the future. 
avn8f8,YTA. Jesús Christ. You sound incredibly insecure. You should work on that before being in a relationship all together. 
avnd0y,"YTA - The thing about apartment living is that everyone else has the same ""right to quiet enjoyment"" as you do. Your neighbors and landlord aren't trying to tell your daughter what to do in your private (rented) home. They're trying to enjoy their home in peace. Your home is private but that doesn't make it isolated. And at this point both the person above you and the people below you have asked you to quiet down, so quiet down or move to a place where your child can make all the noise she wants without bothering anyone."
avnea6,"NTA, your room your rules. Your sister sounds really overbearing, her attitude is not going to serve her son well..."
avnfu7,"NAH

But if you really want to solve problems, you  could use this as a way to recommend you two work on your communication skills because he really is the one you should be talking to. 

It's nice to vent and get perspective from a friend (I do that occasionally) but I also understand keeping things within the relationship only (my SO has always been very about privacy like yours). No assholes for having differences of opinions on how to handle this."
avnj45,"NTA.

I mean he gave you his login knowing what was gonna be there."
avnk5q,"YTA

It sounds like Slack is meant for business purposes, not to call out what you deem to be gross behavior.  If you had an issue with it, you should have taken it to HR or something - not called it out like this."
avnld1,"NTA if she can be crazy and wild with strange men, she should be able to do that with you as well. A safe place would mean she could be open with with you without feeling judged, so then why is she being crazy and open with others who are supposedly not a safe place? Her logic seems backwards to me. "
avnprn,"NTA - If anything the more asinine thing to say was that they “didn’t care enough” about you to get a gift. Obviously we can’t read tone through next but I don’t really see anything wrong with what you said, though had she been present then maybe it would’ve been in poor taste."
avnue5,[deleted]
avnxd9,"NTA

Your uncle sounds like a real creep. Please if your mother doesn’t respect that you’re uncomfortable; take note of everything your uncle does to you, says to you, etc.. everything. Assholes like that can be really really nasty if they feel they can take advantage of someone. And honestly at your age, if he ever does anything to you, or endangers you in anyway, speak up and go to the authorities. There is no shame in it. "
avny70,"YTA and I hope you didn’t word your request anything like the way you have spoken about it here. 

Obviously you have the right to feel however you feel about it but ultimately her body her choice and if people don’t like how she presents herself they should avert their gaze."
avo0nr,"NAH

Sometimes it takes a little while to hear back from an employer even if they’re cool with you and are trying to help. Don’t sweat it man, just follow up with him if you want an update of some kind. It wouldn’t be passive aggressive imo. 

Also, you don’t deserve a job ANY less than another person because you have a disability. Your disability doesn’t make you less valuable or subservient to those who don’t have it brother. Chin up."
avo8br,NAH.  You are so generous for recognizing that their hearts are in the right place and they are acting out of love. And it’s still painful to you and you need to disengage which is also totally legit.  I wish I had a magic answer going forward. You seem really together. Hang in there. 
avojhh,"NAH tipping is not required, purely based on service received. If you felt that she did a poor job then no one says you have to tip. If your friend felt she deserved something that’s perfectly reasonable as well, everyone has different ideas about what constitutes good service. If something had happened that was out of her control and she explained that to you, that would be another situation. There are hourly wage jobs if working for tips is not stable or sufficient income. "
avookl,NTA - you tried to help but it just had the opposite effect. you're not your brother's atm
avoql5,"NTA- man you didn’t even have to pay for it. You said it was an accident that you lols grip on the pipe, she shouldn’t have been fucking around anyway and she shouldn’t have put her whole weight on it. AND she is not being an asshole by spreading rumours about you. "
avovsy,"ESH Your (both of you) communication is absolutely toxic. You've come to a point where both of you always jump to the conclusion that the other one is just doing or saying what they are to annoy the other person. It's a downward spiral. You need to remember why you loved this person if you want to break the pattern. It would be a good idea to get help, if you still want to give this marriage a chance. "
avoy1v,"INFO:

I don't have any idea why switching some doors around and probably committing fraud in your partner's name results in the ex-bf giving you money. For a door that now already appears to be replaced and paid for by your gf? 

YTA for not being able to explain your plan better. Be a good boyfriend and just (soberly) fix her door if you want to be useful.  "
avpa88,"YTA for being a mad at your fiance but you're NTA at being annoyed at the girl. 

It's not your fiance's fault sue is flirting with him. You said yourself she is very flirty and you where (are) paranoid . 

The poor fella done nothing wrong. Giving him the cold shoulder for someone else's actions is a very good way of pushing him away . 
"
avpdg3,"NAH. I only say that because I don't consider drug use to be a moral flaw, but coke is super duper addictive, and can bring out really irresponsible and unpredictable behaviors in people.
Still, if this is incompatible with you and your values, or you worry you can't trust her to stop, maybe you shouldn't be together, and definitely not start a family."
avpdgi,NTA at all.  I went through something similar and I didn't attend my father's bed side while he was dying.  I will curation you that this is probably going to be a psychic burden either way.  Have you considered talking to a therapist?
avpl8b,"NAH you have to be very careful and sensitive when you bring it up though. It's a date for the two of you im sure he'll understand

avq8g5,NTA and honestly I'd go as far to try to let her parents know about this even anonymously because that poor girl needs help before it's too late.
avqd6y,"ESH

Your girl needs to learn to keep her mouth shut when it comes to other people's business 

However, if you feel a need to test the other person in the relationship, it's not healthy my dude.   "
avqffo,"ESH

Everyone in this story seems to lose their morality as soon as they are drunk, you all should drink a bit less."
avqgxh,"NTA

When you say you don't want something, your partner should listen to you. And when you explain how you feel, your partner shouldn't get defensive and just dismiss what you're saying. 

What she's doing is basically passive-aggressive affection and attention seeking. Do you think her parents might have been like that to her? Like giving her things and then insisting on only praise and gratitude?"
avqp6q,NTA - the complaints are based on legitimately poor service. Chipotle isn’t going to fold because of your free burrito 🌯 
avr56u,"NTA

NTA. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it. I've politely declined invitations that would have cost me less than $700. In fact, I'm declining my family's reunion this year because it's at a campground where they only allow one unit (albeit RV, tent, etc.). This means that I'd have to buy my own site at $85/night, and seeing as I only have a tent, I wouldn't benefit from the full-hookup. 

It's just not worth it for me. "
avrb9s,"YTA.

You want the new coffee, deal with the old coffee first. 

Consideration for everyone in that office, take two minutes and empty the old pot, get the next one ready to run. 

"
avrc4a,NAH I would be annoyed too but as a guy I can relate. Hopefully he will get over his insecurities. Bald is in fashion again so it's no biggie.
avrekq,"I guess YTA but mostly just uninformed. That is a very normal policy to not release final pay until all company property is returned. That is our policy (I work in HR) and it has been policy everywhere I work. We would not mail you a check until the key had been returned. 

Your boss (of one day) sounds like she is inexperienced and flew off the handle quickly and with little reason. However she is absolutely right to not release pay until she has your key in hand. "
avreq1,"NTA - you didnt tell them literally to ""Fuck Off""   

i can understand why they are desperate to have you put your life on hold until you get your own place to live and can help them out financially.  they are probably wondering how can you think about taking any breaks given the current situation."
avrgen,"NTA - Keywords here are ""prepared speech"". That does suggest a scam. What he did is attempt emotional extortion by shaming you into generosity, you stood your ground."
avrhoh,"NTA but don't play games, just communicate"
avrkos,NAH. It seems as though you haven’t explained your side/account to the teacher. I think it’s fair to assume that the young kid mistook what you said as directed towards him (depending on where he was). Try and get your side in and be more careful in the future
avrp00,"YTA. If you don't like the prices, go where it's cheaper - this is right up there with people wanting free art from an artist. What you charge for what you do is on you, and you cannot hold someone else to the same standards. Not to mention, photographers get a bit less business on a consistent basis than mechanics.

If the phone ringing is bothering you you turn the ringer down/off from your end.

How frequently your brothers girlfriend calls him is between the two of them.  Maybe he has a habit of loosing/walking away from his phone and this is a reasonable way to get him to realize he's being called.

You're not an asshole for feeling left out. They're not assholes for not including you. 

As to how to bring it up, you just ask them. But be ready for a hurtful answer. Unless you actually don't have the money and told them, it's pretty likely the answer is, ""we don't want you to come"" and the reason is going to be something personal to you. Either you're annoying, no fun to travel with, maybe you snore, or smell bad, or you scared away all the potential hookups. 

Or they might just shrug and say ""sorry bro, thought you knew what we were planning. Next time!"""

avuyzf,"NAH for wanting to talk about it.

YTA if you think it's not racist. Whatever historical meaning or cultural meaning it has to you, the flag is waved around by racists and has been stolen as an image by racists.  Also, it was invented as a tool by racists in the early 1900's, but whatever, you obviously need to learn about the flag's history.

For example, in my area in the Pacific Northwest, there are a lot of people with confederate flags! Except none of them are from the South, and my state wasn't a state until after the civil war and it never had slaves. So what purpose do the people here have for using that symbol? Racism."
avv1y5,"NTA - she asked you what you wanted, blatantly disregarded your wishes without telling you, and then had the nerve to pull the Pikachu reaction when you’re upset?

The obvious solution is that you move out, and you're already doing that. So, that's good.

I just don't see a reason to act the way she did bro.
Whether she was upset previously to this 'event' or not, that is no way to treat your partner.

Mixed signals and broken communication can easily ruin a relationship. As with most men, I'm sure there were some ""signals"" she was giving that you didn't even know were meant to be signals. People, especially females, do it all the time.
Not being straightforward is probably the biggest reason people in relationships have a communication breakdown.

She showed you respect by being upfront with you - the least you could have done was be upfront with her too as you walked away. 

Edit: _Added my judgement above after asking for more info, which is what is written below this italic text._

^(Questions I asked before editing to write my judgement:) Did you tell her why you walked away? Were you honest and up front? Honestly, it's how you ended it that will determine my final verdict. So how did that go? "

> Against my beliefs, I agreed to be in an exclusive relationship with her because I knew it'd make her feel better.

But it sounds like against her beliefs, she agreed to be in an open relationship with you because she knew it'd make you feel better? 

The whole thing isn't ""spurred"" by these two friends. It's not fair to say you pursuading her is just a natural course of things while they're just ""getting in her head"". You don't get to dictate what people can talk about; unless it's a personal secret they have no business sharing, they're free to share their opinion of you. If Ava feels ""harassed"", she can stop the conversation. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean she's being harassed and you can step in to tell them what they're allowed to talk about. You should wallk the walk and ""stay in your lane"". 

If she's not comfortable with an open relationship, you need to have an honest conversation determining your compatibility instead of persuading her to be in one or changing yours into an exclusive one and then getting resentful about it. "
aw08o0,"NTA. Hooly shit. I’ve never lost a loved one through a traumatic but I would bet my buttons that what your husband is doing is not healthy grieving at all. It’s one thing to keep mementos of her and a whole other to dedicate a whole room to her memory and continuously fill it with new things that he buys you.

He needs therapy, stat. And if he won’t go, go without him. You’re going to have to talk to a professional how to navigate this, especially if it might lead to divorce. "

You wanted a casual thing. That means she doesn't owe you an explanation for when she bails. Nor should you feel entitled to her time. If you wanted to be more of a priority in her life (which you evidently do since you got worked up about this) then you should make that clear to her."

No matter for whatever reason there is, nobody has the right to spread that information around but you. If people didn't know before A had told them, you obviously didn't want them to know in the first place.

Completely acceptable behavior from OP. A is the asshole here for sure.

This group dynamic is done specifically to keep everyone in the group honest. Because it's deplorably common for half of a group to actually do the work, and the other half do nothing and all end up with the same grade.

However, you are an adult. Go talk to your professor if you have a problem with something class related. It's not High School. I'm sure if you had had a civil chat with him for a couple of minutes they could have clearly told you the reason for it.

If you are really, really careful with condoms and she's on birth control, it's unlikely that she will get pregnant. but obviously, it is always a risk when you have sex. 

But here's the thing - you could be dating someone that swears up and down that they would get an abortion if they got pregnant, and that person could *still* change their mind when it came time to do the procedure. 

So break up with this girl if this is freaking you out, but recognize that you're always taking a risk when you have heterosexual sex."

coughing/sneezing into your elbow & washing your hands are common courtesy to not spread germs. i would have been SUPER unhappy to see him digging around in communal chips like that.

i can’t guess the frequency & tone of your supposed multitude of reminders, but your roommate was also sick, not wanting to hear them. at the end of the day, you’re his roommate, not his mother, & you can only control your own behavior/actions. once you saw he didn’t care about correcting the behavior, you could have washed your hands more, cleaned communal spaces, or worn a mask, etc., thereby preventing yourself from getting sick.

so NTA, but maybe less policing of others & more focus on what you can do to help yourself (before things escalate to ESH)."
aw34ta,"NAH

- I believe it's a normal request to not maintain contact with an ex. It doesn't matter on how good or bad terms it ended up. It's even worse in that case because the gf/bf now knows that there will be some ""emotional charge"" to the meeting:

a) you and your ex are comfortable still spending time around each other, sharing stories and getting touchy etc.

b) you and your ex hate and shout at each other every chance they get, possibly leading to arousal and hate-sex.

(EDIT: odds of this happening are irrelevant, the mere existence of these possibilities can make the SO worried)

The question here is what do you care about more - a friendship with an ex or a healthy relationship with your current gf?"
aw37cr,"NTA 

You weren’t in the wrong in any case here, your ex bf and ex friend acted like ignorant dicks. 

Whether what they did was objectively “wrong” because they didn’t cheat, nor did they lie while you were still dating is “arguable”

However, what they did was tactless. They’re supposed to care about you, if they had a spine they’d have told you immediately and honestly and taken your inevitable anger on the chin as the price of their relationship. 

They’re shifting the blame onto what they see as an easy target. 

They’re cowards. "

Just like you, my friends got sick of it.  
  
Most LGBT folks I've known experienced the same thing to some degree, and your friend is most likely experiencing it too. That feeling can be difficult to reign in, but she'll calm down with time as it becomes the new normal.

It’s also completely possible that she isn’t cheating and that she’s just insanely immature. 

This is some trope played out all over television and movies and I can completely understand some massively immature and insecure 19yr old thinking that this is the way things are supposed to work. It could also be her stupid ass friends in her ear talking about how “he’s definitely cheating on you” and she wants to let you know she’d rather keep you than lose the relationship to an indiscretion (again, in a very immature way). 

Maybe she is cheating on you but I feel like you deserve an alternate perspective on this since everyone always jumps straight to infidelity and nefarious intentions on this sub.

The calling you autistic and giving you shit for not getting it elevates this from NAH to NTA. 
awacge,"NTA.  I'm a mom of kids your age.  You'd have no way of knowing a girl your age would still believe those things were real.  Your behavior was perfectly reasonable and rational.  

It's nice that you stopped talking about it when you realized it upset her."
awad6n,NTA. The fact that your parents enabled her to make poor choices and didn't give you the same things that they gave her is dumbfounding. I'm sorry to hear that they did that to you.
awafu3,"NTA

wtf is wrong with your girlfriend? She's gaslighting you here, don't believe her and don't let her make you feel bad about it. And seriously consider if you want to stay in a relationship with such a person."
awahko,"NTA

Your parents seem to be working out visitation in a pretty sane manner, and for your grandpa to try and veto your parent's choices and make you choose between him and your dad is a pretty shitty thing to do. 

I'm sorry your grandpa made you feel stuck in between a rock and a hard place. He's the asshole right now, not you.

"
awai5l,"NTA

Only siths deal in absolutes."
awajpn,So... It's a relationship where you need to justify yourself for asking for a date...?
awalhv,"NAH.

Obviously she's not an asshole. And you aren't either. Just be honest with her man. It doesn't sound like she's dating you for your money anyway, no offense, since you don't have much compared to her. 

Did you ever consider the possibility that she wants to take you since she can afford it? And there's nothing wrong with that either. 

But just sit down and talk to her about your concerns. "
awao0b,"YTA.  Not for wanting a spouse with a meaningful career or interests, but for how you're going about doing it.  You're essentially setting yourself up as dictator as to what is and is not acceptable in her career. You don't have a right to unilaterally ""set that as minimum salary for careers to consider."" "
awaorz,"NTA, you Made an assumption. Also She didn’t give a preference (or at least didn’t react to the question). So you’re good. "
awaqk6,"YWBTA unfortunately, it is a breach of privacy and your mother will likely never forgive you. Also it's a bad idea because you reaaaallly don't want to be in the middle of a marital dispute. Truly. The best thing you can do for yourself is to go to therapy to better express how their behavior negatively affects you. Do what you can for yourself, and advocate for yourself as much as you can - but don't violate your mother's trust and expect her to thank you for it later."
awaspi,"Nta. Your kid, your rules. Do the bris and naming ceremony go together? Or can you have the naming ceremony separately, and be mohelless?"
awayid,"NAH 

I understand you feel mad since you have to pay for parking but if they aren't causing trouble I wouldn't snitch on them. Just seems like managements fault. I'd do it too if I could for free."

awb15q,"NTA I dont cry if someone dies, not everyone deals with emotion the same way"
awb2to,"NTA - you don't owe her an explanation.  As long as you didn't leave behind a trail of joint expenses that you bailed on.  If you were free to move out, owed no money and were not happy due to infidelity... you are golden.

I don't think I personally would have handled it that way, but it is what it is."
awb3i6,"NTA, it seems like a dick move but to be fair you are just using your email, they could cancel their subscription etc. You are using the resources made available to you by someone elses thievery."
awb84h,...have you talked with your roommate about it?
awb88x,"NAH, but for your own mental health, don't diagnose yourself, go seek professional help.  You're going to struggle to get through life if you let fear of noises rule your existence."
awb9pv,NTA i think.. If he didnt mention he needed to go early that day how would you know to wake up earlier?
awb9ro,"NAH - While I don't think he has a *right* to know, it's obviously upsetting you that you're keeping something from him that's affected you so deeply. If you're looking for official internet permission do not tell him: you've got it. But if you're looking for someone who supports you telling him if it will make you feel better: you've got that too."
awbg3x,"Very much convinced this is a SHP.

Either way, wrong sub, try r/relationshipadvice.

awbhry,"NTA - 10000%. You need to block your ex on all social media and it will be healthy for you to move on in life. He found someone else (multiple) during your marriage, so he'll find someone else later"

awbqso,"NTA.
It’s a lease violation for a reason. Owners need to be responsible and pick up after their pets and respect the shared living space. 

And for those who say the neighbor is not in the wrong for leaving poop in nature have clearly never stepped in animal shit.

EDIT: a word"
awbr0n,"NAH; I think what she may be alluding to is ""The Mental Load"". You seem like a nice guy doing your best for your wife so i won't call you the asshole. I do have a link for reading though about The Mental Load.

As any work place knows, the best type of work is the kind that doesn't require much conversation to happen, meaning everyone knows what has to be done and carried it out.

When it's not like that, you find your work getting dragged down having to remind people things, answering questions that you feel they should already know the answer to etc.

&#x200B;

I think what she was looking for was, ""Hey hun, i'm going to run out on some errands. While i'm at the store i'll grab you the cold medicine in liquid since i know you drink the liquid, some of your favorite juice, and some healthy easy to eat snacks. If there is anything I missed or crosses your mind, just text me I love you"""
awbyvg,"NAH

Nothing's official, that's why he's been chatting up other girls. But your perfectly ok to cancel the date as much as he would be if he decided he'd rather go out drinking with his mates"
awc0gm,NTA You are entitled to buy things exclusively for yourself. Being in a relationship doesn't mean that you are obligated to share everything. You are allowed to own things for yourself. Plus you have dietary restrictions that he is not respecting. I think you are 100% in the right here.
awc1ky,NTA. You even offered to leave. All three of you are sharing a room and being comfortable and feeling safe while you sleep is more important than getting laid. 
awc1vd,"NTA You're not rehoming your dogs for a shitty, selfish reason, you are doing so out of love. You know that you can't give your dogs all they need right now and you dont want to end up homeless for the sake of you, your child and your dogs. It's a heartbreaking decision but you're NTA"
awc31s,"NAH. But next time use the word ""date""."
awc46q,"NTA- This has to be a shitpost otherwise you need to leave your boyfriend because he’s showing you a red flag by not being concern about a human being that could be possibly DYING. He is being insensitive and stupid.

Edit: Wait so he’s watching tv while you do laundry dishes and writing BOTH of your rent checks?"
awcalz,"Sounds like you need r/advice more than AITA. 

You can make your own way and choose your own friends, but you’d be a fool to think you can avoid people who don’t meet your “criteria”. 
Some people are really good at hiding what they’re going through, and you can be friends with someone for years when they get blindsided by something tragic or awful. "
awcasd,"NTA. If you weren’t comfortable, you were under no obligation to stay. Kudos to you for helping out the way you did."
awcbbh,"NTA; i think it's kind of a dick move to exclude people based on their device. Apple is in no way better than android. Apple can suck these nuts. Android gang rise up.

Find a different ""group"". Maybe group up with those android users. Those apple users seem like assholes. ""If you were a better friend, we'd add you""? what the fuck? that one doesn't even seem like a joke."
awceif,ESH. This is fraud and very likely will get you fired. Talk to someone in HR and ask about the raise again and whether you will receive back pay for the weeks your raise wasn’t honored. 
awceio,"NTA.

Using ultimatums *as anything but a last resort* is whats the asshole move.  It might seem like a distinction without a difference, but there is a difference and it's important.  At a certain point you have to put your foot down and look out for yourself, and if you feel you've reached that point that's understandable."
awcex5,"Yta, but sometimes being the asshole is the right thing to do.

"
awcgbn,"NTA. So you’re not the asshole for blaming your parents for screwing you during your stint as a homeschooler - but what are you going to do about it? Blaming them doesn’t undo anything and now, as an adult, it’s your responsibility to get yourself to where you need to be. "
awchfc,"NTA, man. If you go out of your way to help them as much as you can and you ask politely, there’s nothing you can do. Mute them if that’s an option, but if they can’t respect other people’s game then it’s suckish of them"
awcjld,"NAH

This is simply one of the things that goes along with having shared walls.  As long as you aren't obnoxious or vindictive about it and following the co-ops rules you're doing nothing wrong and don't have to change. "
awcnbi,"YTA if you cancel or refuse on short notice.

Are you willing to burn your relationship over this small debt?"
awcoli,"NTA. If you're in a relationship with someone, you've actually gotta, you know, *relate* to them. And if they're not being satisfied in the relationship, then something is wrong. 

Maybe he's confused about his sexuality still and doesn't know how to deal with it? Being in the closet can do that to you, believe me. I don't think threatening a break up is uncalled for. The relationship basically isn't working for you, and that's not a wrong or a right thing, it's just a thing. Either you two need to fix the relationship, or it needs to end."
awcrkx,NTA
awct6l,"YTA. The concept may be fucked up, but you're not sticking it to the man you're fucking over the employee. "
awcu1f,"ESH

You shouldn't have to lie to your friend if you don't want to make the trip to see him. It makes you seem like an ass and will deteriorate your friendship all together.

He shouldn't get mad at you for not wanting too make the trip. An hour drive to hang out with someone can be rough. An hour drive in general can be exhausting. He should understand that 

I think both of you need to sit down and have a thorough conversation about it."
awcw3c,NTA - He's not your responsibility. He's going to have to adapt eventually. 
awd0fb,"NTA

The child support isn't for you.  It's for your child.  Denying your child the support of both parents when it's available would be the dick move.  Carlos doesn't give two shits about you and it sounds like he doesn't care about your child either.  Focus on your daughter and make the decisions that are best for her.  

And it goes without saying but a lawyer is always a fantastic resource in these situations.  Him being in the military is pretty fantastic for you because it really simplified collecting support.  The army is very unhappy about father's who don't support their children."
awd123,"NTA, the joke's context is historical and has nothing to do with race. "
awd1qv,"ESH.   
You primarily for lying. lying is never cool. I get why you didn't invite your friend

awd5jl,[deleted]
awd62f,"YTA if you actually yelled at your mother. I get being annoyed at the nagging, but at the end of the day she has your interests in mind.

Maybe in the future just calmly and politely repeat your point that you're not cold, throw in some jokes, and it'll be all good. "
awddj2,"Honestly? NTA.

She has barely made any noticeable effort to stay sober or become more responsible, doesn't even give the bare minimum to understand her son's disability, and seems to expect everything to just fall into place on a silver platter.

As long as Tommy stays in a safe home with a responsible caregiver, my morals give two shits what happens to Annie. I know, deep down, you probably have at least an inkling of motherly compassion for your daughter, but she's dug her own hole, it's not your responsibility to get her out of it."
awdg17,YTA. Your dog was comfortable and already asleep. 
awdgjn,YTA. Mute him or unfollow him or whatever it is on FB these days and let him be happy and proud. 
awdj9e,"As someone who has spent time in a lot of more rural (but still not very rural) areas where this is common, you would certainly be treated like the asshole and would have a lot of anger at you from the neighbors. At the end of the day better to keep your eyes open for a friendly dog than a not so friendly neighbor. "
awdy6z,"NTA 

I’m not trans so I can only speak from an outside perspective. I think it would be best to tell Aaron that your boss has been outing him to people, because it could put him in danger. 

Is this a chain where you could contact HR about this? If you and/or Aaron want to confront the issue, I feel like that is probably the best way to do it. I wish I had better advice for you. It’s good you’re trying to look out for him. Hopefully people with more experience in this situation find this and can help you out. 

Hopefully both of you can find better jobs very soon. I’d start looking, if I was in this situation. I know that’s easier said than done but I couldn’t stand to work under someone like that."
awe1uc,NTA it's your animal
awe5d8,"ESH plus a big time YTA, nobody held a gun to your head and forced you to have sex with her. She's obviously trash for cheating but so are for being the one she cheated with knowing she was in a relationship. "

awe9an,[removed]
aweisj,"NTA. although someone else called for more info, and maybe it could be relevant if they have done favors for you and your family without little or no pay. it sounds like your mom wants to be generous but instead of giving her own time or effort she is giving yours. if that's what it is, it would be a boundary issue that sucks. "
awewjg,"NTA for wanting to protect your kids. You know nothing about this guy or his friends. 
But boiling it down to ""wanting to feel like the alpha"" does make you seem like an asshole. "
awewnf,"NTA. Moving patients can be super dangerous, he disrupted the staff's ability to care for patients, and he's dumb enough to boast to people about his shitty behaviour. 
Maybe talk to your boss about it first? "
awexxi,"NAH It's cute,  and she still got more than a full meal. Don't be embarrassed, it's a fun first date story!"
awf10h,"NTA. I suspect that your boss had problems managing their responsibilities. ED likely was aware which is why they were so apologetic. 

Hopefully this means that things will be much better when you return. Speaking the truth when things are not right should never be a problem, as long as it’s done with tact. "
awf6qj,NTA. especially since your sister knows how horrible this man is and is letting one of her friends marry him?? i could never. 
awfa5o,NTA your friend has been grooming your son. 
awfadt,"NTA-

It sounds like your sister was forced into a role she shouldn’t have been. If she’s only 16 she could just be going through a phase, and rebelling against the fact that your mom sort of forced her into a mothering role at a young age. You might want to re-evaluate the idea of “cutting her out” and think of it more as just taking some space from her. I’m sure you’ll both grow, mature, and change a lot over the years. "
awfdg5,"NTA. But I have never in my life thought about matching hand soap to dish soap. And I MAKE soap, so it’s not like I’m not particular about it. 

I think she just needs you to relinquish control of this. She is an absolute jerk about how she is going about it, but it seems it triggered when you tried to suggest what order to use the different color soap. Maybe you just make it clear that you thought using it next was logical but of course if she had a plan she could say that too, without all the anger and resentment about it. 

Obviously you can’t relinquish control of the whole household but if there are little things like this that are important to her I would just make it clear that she can do what she wants and you were only trying to help. "

awftt8,"NTA, he's old enough to look after himself, and the both of you are under no obligation to have him imposed onto you. "
awfu0a,YTA. You were around her before you were married and you're acting like suddenly you're not compatible. She's four for godsake! She's not going to act the same way for the rest of her life.

When his birthday comes around, go and eat most of his cake. See how he likes it."
awgdol,"NTA

This girl is literally deciding to push her own opinions on you. She is being pretty entitled."
awggrb,"NAH-

It sounds like she just didn’t like you romantically. She possibly wanted to, as you were such good friends, but if she wasn’t initiating any dates and if she ended things.... she probably just wasn’t feeling it. Now she has feelings for someone else, and I could see how that could upset you, but there’s really no proof she didn’t anything behind your back at all. If you want to remain friends with her I would drop the suspicions and just let her be happy. "
awglo9,"NTA. Your family doesn't seem to understand what having anxiety is like, and it doesn't sound like they have any intention of understanding. Either way, it clearly bothers you, and anyone who is willing to make someone else cry and/or have a panic attack just because it's funny is an a-hole in my book. There are plenty of other funny things in the world they can laugh at."

She already placed me on a list where they call people up to give gifts ad stuff without eve asking beforehand if I'll be able to attend. I feel like a real asshole right now because 18th birthdays only happen once in a lifetime ad I wasn't there to celebrate with her when she was expecting me because I needed to attend a birthday for my uncle who was released out of prison. On the other had, I do feel a bit angry that she listed me before asking. Now everyone has cards with my name on them, ad whoever is attending will expect me to join as well. I feel some conflict. She didn't even tell me the address, she just told me that I'm invited and my name is on the card and I need to give her a gift. She seemed really disappointed days ago when I told her that i could't attend. Stopped talking to me. Didn't even look at me. Tried texting my other friends who were invited but didn't respond. Too busy partying. I have a feeling that people will think of me as a shitty friend and that I'm no good. So, AITA?

awh64k,"YTA - but sometimes that is okay. We didn’t invite my mother-in-laws boyfriend come to our wedding. We knew it was an asshole thing to do. What you need to understand is that this is a very polarizing thing to do. It tells your mom that you don’t respect her decision in who she chose as a boyfriend. It tells the boyfriend that you will never accept him, no matter how long he has been in her life. It may even permanently damage your relationship with your mother. 

We knew all that going in, and still decided that this was the only way forward for us. Some family situations are difficult like that."
awhabg,"ESH

She's being overdramatic for not at least saying goodbye when she left. That being sad, if you and that guy talked the entire night it's easy to make her feel like a third wheel, whether you two are actually dating or are in other relationships. So I understand her side, too."

At the end of the day you've got to do what makes you happy. I'm sure your parents are open minded enough to understand you can't just hate somebody because of where they're from. Civilians surely don't truly want the conflict. 

She sounds like quite the catch for you. I'd personally say ""why not"". Your call. You're just right in not leading her on if you'll never take it to the next level. "
awhlj0,"NTA HELL NO, you aren’t the asshole. You are not subject to the whims and demands of boys, either. "
awhng8,"YTA.  The food was fine, but when they said, ""No"", you should have accepted it.  A restaurant employee cannot give you free food and they cannot give you food out of the trash.  You wanted a freebie and they couldn't give it to you.  Let it go."
awhrxw,"NTA, it sounds like the plan was to go on a vacation with someone you were in a new but enjoyable relationship with. That person showed a dramatically different side to themselves and you recognize the red flag and ended it. I think you're good here. "

awif6l,"I would say YTA if you did so without telling him how his behaviour made you feel. If you had told him that it was making you uncomfortable and you weren’t interested in him that way, but he still continued, then absolutely NTA. 

I’ve been in your shoes, plenty of times, but I think distancing without discussion would make matters worse. A simple text saying: 
“this needs to stop. I appreciate the interest, but your constant asking me out and making conversations about it is making me uncomfortable and I feel that you are disrespecting me by not listening to me when I tell you no. You are my friend and I would like to continue being your friend but if this is going to be how you act then I don’t want that anymore.” And just stick by what you said. "

awixib,You would not be the doing anything inappropriate.  Instead you would be protecting future landlords from becoming victims to these people with no respect for the property of others.  I work for many property management companies and they really appreciate when someone takes the time to report bad tenants.  These people are getting a nearly free ride and do not deserve it if they can’t take care of a property.  Make sure you report them to Tenant Tracker also.   Small claims court is probably pointless as chances are these people are unrecoverable.  You would just be wasting your filing fees and time.
awiyrq,"NAH. He wants to be there for his brother's big day, and you want him to be there for if the baby is born while the wedding is underway. Talk to your husband, tell him EVERYTHING. I'm sure he'll understand and assuage you."

awj5e8,"YTA. He's not inconsiderate, he maybe just has this group that usually hang out together. You might even feel excluded if you went with them (my wife knows a certain group of friends I have since forever feel that way, they're not intentionally excluding her, it's just we have such a long history between us that it's hard to feel like you belong if you have not been part of the group forever). Talk it out instead of being vengeful. Vengeance never solves anything, it just perpetuates the problem. "
awj5jb,"YTA, not for not being attracted to him, but because of how you’re judging him.  Who are you to decide whether or not this guy is in touch with his sexuality?  Also what does it even mean to ‘seem gay’?  That’s projecting false stereotypes.  I find it hard it believe you’ve dated trans/queer/gender fluid people before because of how you’re judging this guy.

I mean yeah she should have been better about taking meds but she probably gave you the sickness before she even showed symptoms and even then, the meds you described don’t affect whether or not she is contagious.

if you’re working equal hours, you share equal responsibility in the home. Because it’s your home, and your life. Your income does not enable you to treat your wife as an employee because you “fund” most of your life together. INCLUDING the care of your child. Talking about your child like your wife should be grateful your money allows her to provide for him. If you weren’t married to your wife, that child would still be YOUR responsibility to clothe, feed and protect.

Here's the thing, miscarriages will always hurt the expectant parents.  Even though they are surprisingly common they are still going to hurt.  Even if they don't announce it and act like they won't get excited until week 12, they are still going to be hurt from day 1.

So what you're saying is ""my coworker went through a traumatic experience and told me.  AITA for wishing she didn't tell me about it?"". And yeah, that's kind of an asshole stand to take.  It sounds like she really appreciated your support through this so she's better off for having shared this.  And if you actually hadn't cared and hadn't said anything that would be fine too.  But your coworker is in pain an you care enough to be sad too.  Its unreasonable to put this on her not to have caused you that sadness, you know?

And I get the social norm is to wait until the second trimester.  But all that does is hide and put even more of a stigma (or at least taboo) on miscarriages.  And as you said, miscarriages are really common.  And normalizing them and discussing them just might help people to deal with them."

At 70, your parents remember a time when family was quite close, I’d wager.

Cancer really, really sucks, and I'm so sorry you went through that. It makes a lot of sense that you would want support from those closest to you and that you'd want people to visit. If I were in your shoes, I'd feel incredibly hurt that she didn't come up to see me.

But in the midst of med school stress, she might have seen herself as being forced to choose between you and her future as a doctor. Med school is incredibly demanding, and it's a fucked up, cold, and uncaring system. I have a friend who did poorly on a med school exam because of a family emergency and she had to go before a board to avoid getting kicked out. Medical school is extremely expensive and if you fuck it up, not only do you lose the chance to become a doctor, you don't get that money back and you have to start paying back your loans. Her future and her career matter, too, and depending on where she was in her studies at that point, it could have put her future in the program at risk.

awr1mf,"YTA. If you're truly sorry, you don't get to dictate how they should treat you. They have a right to enforce boundaries, and if that's treating you like a ""monster"", you're basically saying they deserve no boundaries or respect from you. They didn't gaslight you or abuse you or break into your home or assault you - how is them telling you not to get too close ""treating you like a monster""? Just because you feel bad doesn't mean this person is actually harming you. Own your own feelings as well as your actions, and don't blame your feelings on this person. They did nothing wrong. 

Also, you don't get to decide what you ""deserve"" from them. As long as they're not abusing you, they have a right to treat you however they want. 

They obviously don't want to interact with you. You're aggressively pushing boundaries with explaining yourself when they didn't ask, telling them how to treat you, asking them for details on their feelings, etc. etc. Everything is about your needs and wants, and you sound super entitled; this might be why they might not want to be friends with someone like you who doesn't respect them at all. You don't get to decide that what you did ""wasn't enough to kill everything we shared blahblah"". If they treat you distantly, accept that it was enough to make them treat you that way. You asking them is basically wanting to measure up their treatment of you against what you think you deserve, so you can argue and feel vindicated and try to defend yourself, either to yourself or to them or to internet strangers. Your entire mindset from start to finish is a huge string of YTA attitude and behavior. Leave them alone, FFS."

You going back to college shouldn’t be about the parties, even if that is something you missed by not going to college earlier. You’re grown and need to act as such. I’m sure all the students think you’re great, but you can’t really blame them for being uncomfortable about a guy 10+ years their senior trying to come to their parties.

They are *jet engine loud* when they are upset and can and will scream for hours at a time, just like a human baby tbh.

If you don't have a family to spread the work among, be prepared to have no hobbies for several months.

As someone who's only ever rescued adult dogs who works full time and is now raising a puppy alone (temporarily, my husband is away), I can tell you that puppies are the worst pet anyone can own. In fact, if they didn't turn into dogs, I don't think anyone would ever keep puppies. They're 24/7 work. Even when you're away from them, your constantly obsessing over them - wondering if they shit everywhere while you were gone.

awur4p,"YTA - you can’t communicate your needs to your life partner and just blatantly ignore her? That’s terrible. Super asshole move. I get being an introvert, and I LOVE silence, but how you acted is just selfish and rude."
awuwz8,"NAH. You guys are in a relationship so I think it’s reasonable that you’d share your opinion on the matter. That said, his relationship with his mother is really kind of his relationship, so it’s his call in the end and all you can really do is express your opinion and try to support his decisions when you can. He shouldn’t get upset over you sharing your opinion though it sounds like he didn’t get really upset but just maybe frustrated/surprised by the comment and ended the call short (though maybe just missing info). Seems like no one here handled the situation overly poorly, so I’m saying NAH."
awux2r,"NTA:

I'm fully aware that I'm very precious over my tech but I just wouldn't let them use it any more. "
awv1e6,"YTA- yes your mother shouldn’t have taken you to the hospital, but she blatantly just cares about you a lot. Imagine how scary it must have been for her to find you passed out in the car high. You seem to be taking a lot out on her when all she wants is what’s best for you. 

When I was 15 I smoked a ton of weed and was absolutely mentally addicted to it. My mom punished me like crazy for it. I’m 22 now and I can’t believe the type of person I was at that age. I don’t even smoke weed anymore and I legally can now.  If I wasn’t punished for what I did I don’t even know how bad my life would have turned out "
awvaqj,"Nta, but not going to church doesn't make you an atheist it just means you don't attend church.  You are 100% entitled to your religious beliefs and if mom can't handle it that's her problem. "

awvi52,"I think this is different for everyone.  Personally as a dog owner, I don't mind if someone throws their dog's poop in my trash can IF it's full.  But if it's already been emptied then hell no.

But if I wasn't a dog owner and someone put their dog's poop in my bin?  I'd be pretty pissed.  I wouldn't want my plastic bin to absorb any of that odor.  Maybe that's paranoid... but it's my bin.  Keep your poop out of it.

YTA."
awvml7,"ESH. If your wife was concerned about you potentially cheating; congratulations, by lying to her you did nothing but fuel her worries. At the same time, going through your phone and messages was a complete invasion of privacy. I’d say you’re both in the wrong here. "
awvnqu,NAH. You both came into the game with different objectives - neither of which were wrong. I think this just means you aren’t meant to play together. 
awvuoh,"YTA for not taking personal responsibility for your life now that you're an adult. Blame your parents all you want, it won't change anything. "
awvxkc,[deleted]
aww11o,"NTA. They were rude and were talking loudly while you were on the phone. They could have waited for you to get off the phone to discuss payment, but they didn’t care and decided to insult you instead for being understandably annoyed. Maybe you could have told them that you were on the phone, but I know that I’ve been on important calls and not wanted to say things like that in the middle of the call.

There definitely is a double standard. They got upset and started insulting you because you were annoyed because they were rude to you. "
aww4yl,NTA: you asked him several times and he kept saying no. So he gave his chance up. He is a douche for telling others about it and making it seem like you stole her or something. Those are some petty friends.
aww5w5,[deleted]
aww996,NAH. Start making a habit of sitting down together before she goes shopping and give her an idea for a meal or two that your enjoy that week. You won’t have to worry about whether she has what she needs to make it and she can choose what day would work to make it. 
awwadc,"NTA

Nobody can force you to stay at a job you hate. You already mentioned turn over was high, I doubt management has hurt feelings about you leaving.

Enjoy not working in a hellscape."
awwavw,"NTA - while you shouldn't ban him from calling some nights, every single night is too much in my opinion. When my parents got divorced, I lived with my mom and talked to my dad maybe once or twice in the span of not seeing him every other weekend. If your son doesn't want to talk, he especially shouldn't try to force it."
awwfj6,"NTA. You informed him, a risk was taken. You tried to be sympathetic but he started bring threatening. Sucks, sure. But. He had all the necessary information, and he is an adult. 

Good you cut contact. "
awwfwq,Nta and you should tell her sister to get fucked by a cactus. .
awwhz6,"NAH

Let him keep it on there.  Med schools are looking for well-rounded candidates,  so along with the regular stuff like grades, MCAT, research, and clinicals, they would also like seeing he has a way to enjoy his time and an outlet for when things get very stressful,  which they will in med school. 

"
awwk2d,"NTA - she's an ex, you owe her nothing at all. 

If she wanted you keep paying for her food and shelter she should have thought of that before sleeping with someone else."
awwkdn,"NTA. She could genuinely just be worried, but it seems more like a gossip than anything else. There's nothing wrong about wearing the same clothes twice, it's none of her business, she's not even your friend so she probably doesn't even know about your real financial situation, she just assumed things out of nowhere and proccedeed to share it with everyone else. Pretty dumb. "
awwkj5,"NTA: It's perfectly normal to want to stay with someone you want to be with, especially if you just went out with your family last week, as long as everything has a balance and you don't spend every second with one or the other, it should be just fine.

Although just my 2¢, just tell your family the truth, you want to visit your boyfriend and hangout with friends, being honest with them will only nenefit you in the future because if they found out that (insert excuse here) was false, they'll just be suspicious of something nefarious happening in the future. Honesty can really be the best policy 🙂"
awwmsy,YWBTA. Not wanting to be pregnant doesn't always mean not wanting to be a parent or be around kids. It's her life and her decisions. Let her make them. 
awwo1u,NTA. Talk to your mutual about your reasons why though.
awwqzc,"NTA. She could at the very least be appreciative and kind toward you guys. I know mental problems can be really hard to deal with, but that's all the more reason to be thankful for all the people in your life who are willing to help you deal with things.

Edit: fixed typo"
awwu0e,"YTA. Amy is clearly uncomfortable with this and you will be pushing her away. Going on this trip is emotionally irresponsible to Melissa because she clearly has expectations that aren't going to be met. You're going to have a bad time, alienate Melissa, and piss off Amy. I'm not sure what you can do to fix this, but going and staying alone with Melissa is a bad idea."
awwwhu,"Definitely NTA. Those who are telling you to ""give her another chance"" would feel differently if they were the ones being trashed by this insecure, poor excuse for a friend. "
awwybs,YTA- But not for the reason you state. I respect you for being honest with your Father. That was the right thing to do. YTA because you came home shitfaced drunk and disrespected your parents home and exposed them to your debauchery. The correct thing would be to be discrete when you are doing something that is directly opposed to their beliefs. If you are going to get drunk stay at a friends place. If you are going to eat pork do it at a restaurant when they are not in attendance. You live in their home be respectful of their wishes when you are in it. Live your life as you see fit. Don't rub their faces in it.
awx19l,ESH. You're both shaming eachother. Grow up.
awxapw,NTA. The person to take the garbage out of the bin should take it to the dumpster as well. Your roommates are being lazy. 
awxgkp,"NTA.

Your step-son should, and will, know who is paying for his college. That information will be brought to light eventually, and there is no way around that, unless one of his parents lies to him. Shouldn't be important at the moment, however, unless he starts college soon."
awxgn9,"NTA, she wanted time to figure out if she wanted to dump you for someone else or not. I think that's enough said, really."
awxh5i,"NTA.

Honestly I hate it when workers try to guilt trip you into tipping, especially when you didn't request the service in the first place."
awxhb1,[deleted]
awxmfc,"NTA
You told him last time how much it hurt you, and he has done it again despite this. 
What did you do to “overreact”?"
awxpux,"YTA. You being in a relationship doesn’t make the two of you one person. You should each be responsible for a portion of the rent. If you don’t want to do that, it’s time to live without a roommate. "
awxpy5,NTA. It’s time to file for divorce. She basically married you thinking she could change you and then “tested” you by offering a solution she was never going to be okay with. 
awxq5z,NTA. You’re both consenting adults and your relationship is nobody else’s business. 
awxsc3,"ESH 
  
Your girlfriend was verbally abusive but it doesn’t sound like you were giving her space either. You should probably stay broken up this time for both your sakes."
awxso1,"YTA

A lie of omission is still a lie.  You should have been honest with this woman from the get-go, THAT is the only way that open relationships work.

You're a 10/10 asshole.

She's 10/10 justified."
awxwb5,[deleted]
awy2n0,"NTA, the timing of her grandfather's death has nothing to do with this. Your (ex?) gf was clearly prioritizing her friend all the time over you, and that was the problem, not her grandfather's death."
awy3fz,"YTA for saying that after you knew she already bought the dress.  The time for criticism is before she buys it, not after.  Once it’s purchased you should only be supportive, even if you don’t like it. "
awy67g,"NTA. 

I mean, it sucks for her. realistically, your relationship won't survive going to the airforce. But you have to think of your future first and that doesn't mean you don't care for her, but long term your plans have changed. That's life. And it sucks sometimes, but that's reality. "
awy6z6,"NAH. You're not wrong to want to keep a schedule but he's not an asshole to ark you to keep the kids on a Friday night cause he has something planned.

I'd understand if it was every weekend or so but once in a while, I see no harm in that. "
awy8rh,"Of course YTA.

You acknowledge that you gave her a present, and you just happen to still have it in your possession. The fact that you broke up doesn't magically make her stuff yours. If you don't give it to her then you are stealing it. 

It may feel good to screw her out of the ticket to get back at her, (and being an asshole does sometimes feel awesome), just don't try to hide fact that it does make you the asshole in this case.

Since you said you got her 2 tickets, I'm assuming you really got her 1 ticket and yourself 1 ticket. If that is the case then give her the one ticket that is rightfully hers and tell her she can buy your ticket from you if she wants to sit with someone she likes/knows. Otherwise you are selling it and she can go alone.
"
awyd02,"ESH. Those girls suck for assuming they can come onto a boat you guys rented, your friend sucks for entertaining the idea before properly consulting, you kinda suck for not even taking into consideration the people you’re renting the boat from, they rented it to YOU, not for YOU to rent out further. 

Caveat, NTA for wanting to charge them, that’s not unreasonable. If I were in their shoes, I’d totally be fine with that. "
awyew3,"NTA at all
>it was the only way I knew how to help since I’m a young teenager and not a therapist.

This exactly. You did exactly what you're supposed to do - you told an adult better equipped to handle the situation. **You're a good friend and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.** She might never forgive you, but you know you did the right thing and that's all that matters. Sometimes you have to risk a friendship in order to get a friend the help they need."
awyfh9,Really? No. NTA. You don’t have to hug your own fucking family if you do not wish to. 
awyggk,NTA. Send a nice gift and heartfelt card and save your frequent flier miles. 
awyhp5,"NTA. Give forgiveness when a) it genuinely would help you feel better or b) the person is genuinely sorry and it would also help you.

This is neither of those. He's an asshole, you aren't being one."
awyi8k,"NTA. These are perfectly legitimate and understandable feelings. You have done nothing to sign up for taking care of another human being (it's not like she's your kid), and that was wrong of your dad to ""joke"" about, because it sounds like he probably is really thinking along those lines.

Be honest with your parents about how you feel- make clear that it's insane that you're expected to be a full-time babysitter (grounded for no phone in a theater? That's fucking bullshit)."
awykin,"NTA - sounds like a toxic environment for you.  Talk to your mom about it all and maybe she can talk to your Dad, or the courts to end your week off, week on thing.   Otherwise, you'll have to hold out until you are 18, then can make the same choice your older sister has."
awynnc,"NTA - She failed to agreed terms. Additionally, she seems disorganized and more than a little dishonest. Manipulation works best when you make others feel guilt. Don't buy into it. "
awynzq,"ESH 

He asked you not to eat in his car and you did. Yes his response was seriously out of line and he is clearly an asshole, but he gave you a fairly low bar to reach and you deliberately broke his rule. "
awyp6a,"ESH, Chip is a bit of an asshole, but honestly he needs a job just as much as Dale. If he was a better looking applicant, then so be it. I would inform him calmly that it was a dick move to do and that he shouldn’t have gloated about getting the interview. Don’t freak out on him. "
awyp9z,"NTA

If this is what 7 years of ""Friendship"" looks like, sign me up to a lifetime subscription of being a loner.  

Don't feel bad - She treated you like shit and deserves to kick rocks."
awyqdo,[removed]
awytjl,"YTA

Even if it wasn't a doctor, what if a patient forgot something about their medication and went to wikipedia to check before they contacted their doctor? 

You still risked real harm to someone (no matter if it'd be a stupid call on their part or not) to prove a point to someone else.  "
awyx88,"ESH. She’s being dishonest, but you’re acting as though a couple text conversations gives you the right to know what she’s doing in her life. The two of you aren’t in an exclusive relationship so she can do what she wants and tell you as much or as little as she wants. "
awz8hr,"NAH, seems pretty strange to keep it for 10 months but if it was your holiday gift that's reasonable... but there's nothing wrong with asking for it early, either, as long as you don't make any demands."
awzei3,"NAH. If you didnt make arrangements with her, then you cant be an asshole for not driving her."
awzeib,Just gloss over the rest of the post where OP talks about all his rebuked attempts to engage convos and be friendly.
awzes7,"ESH

It seems like the only reason you brought this up was to spite the Boy in question. If you truly cared about your friend's party/rules you would've told her at the time. On her part to stop talking to you is pretty over the top. Furthermore to chose not to be mad at the boys in question points to the fact that she was looking for something to be mad at you about. I repeat ESH "
awzf5c,YTA. Just be a nicer person and fix your issues rather than abandoning her wtf. 
awzj8y,"Asshole would be too strong a word, but it would be tacky. Don’t do it. "
awzmgo,"NTA, you don't have to go anywhere with anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable, especially a guy who continuously ignores your discomfort with his comments and actions."
awznte,"NTA by a long shot. Divorce him, kick him out, and move on."
awzpes,"NAH, are you sure your friend's card didn't just get charged with all the food though? Seems weird they'd just forget to take your cash like that."
awzq9e,NTA. Complaining about business practices and faults is totally fine. I wouldn't expect any resolution however.
awzs0k,"NAH - Assuming you frame this properly.

It might seem like it doesn't matter, but there's a huge distinction between saying ""I want you to quit smoking"" and ""my partner smoking is a deal breaker for me"". And even though they lead to the same conclusion there's just an inherent difference between the two.  The implication is that obviously she can do whatever she wants; it's her life and all that.  But there are certain decisions you will make depending on her choices.

As long as you go with the second option, make it about you and your needs, you're not an asshole.  And similarly she's not the asshole if she isn't interested in quitting.  Sometimes people break up without anyone doing anything wrong."
awztnz,"NTA, but I wouldn't plan on taking a cruise pregnant while your mom is still alive."
awzuvd,"NTA. Everyone claiming otherwise are thr kind of people that would colour their hair blue before turning up to a fancy event photographed, paid for and designed for someone else"
awzvbw,"YTA. This is actually very straightforward. A lighter is a form of personal property. By taking it from him, you're a thief. Thieves are assholes. Therefore, you are the asshole, thief."
awzwwj,NTA. You had a grandfather you loved and this man means nothing to you. Can I also point out that your dad was kind of a dick to tell you all of this? It just wasn’t necessary and did nothing but hurt you. 
ax01ha,"NAH

He's mad because he has to miss a really cool trip, and it's the sort of thing that typically people can only do once every few years at the very very most, and in school probably a whole lot less.

But it isn't anyone else's fault but his that he can't go. That probably upsets him more, but it absolves you all of a lot of the potential guilt for him not coming. He wasn't excluded, he just couldn't go. 

Hope your friend does well on the retakes, and you can all find some other cool shit to do together!"
ax05nh,"NAH - You have a right to feel hurt however, they have a right to be friends and if it makes you uncomfortable or betrayed in any way, maybe you should cut ties with those friends. "
ax05oy,"NAH

This girlfriend is not your ex-gf; She might surprise you and be way more open and accepting than you're giving her credit for."
ax07du,You posted this last night and I’ll tell you the same thing now as I did then
ax07ig,"NAH - Tricky situation especially if your boyfriend is sensitive. If anything, it might’ve been better to focus on how the original dress didn’t fit and how you might get a different size. Then maybe say the store didn’t have your size so you got a different dress lol"
ax087x,Dude we need way more fucking context 
ax08py,"YTA

These are literal children.   As a girl scout who handled this kind of thing for our troop once upon a time, I can tell you that part of being prepared is to plan ahead for things like this.  "
ax0bix,"NTA 

While you are aware you didn’t actually own the seat or have “dibs”, that guy definitely knew he was being an asshole and you didn’t force him to move his kid.   You didn’t even cause a scene "
ax0co5,NTA
ax0eou,"NTA, assuming it was just a nudge and you had already told him to leave your dog alone. Otherwise YTA."
ax0eug,"NAH.  It's not your fault if he gets in trouble at work. If he wants to text you and answer texts, let him. Dont stress about it. It's not your fault at all if he gets in trouble
"
ax0iwq,"NTA. If your kid is a girl, and you want them to be called by a girl, that's how it is. If she grows up and decided otherwise, that can be dealt with then. Your cousin is being an asshole for making you feel bad. Also, this does not seem to concern her issues, so you (probably) wont be offending her by asking her to use she/her pronouns."
ax0kcl,"NTA for breaking up with long distance gf for cheating and generally drifting apart.

But YTA for doing it to be with her best friend. 

Check your motivation for the split. If the cheating isn't enough to break up, def YTA."
ax0kvh,"NAH 
Think about her son as if he was a video game that you’re obsessed with but nobody around you has played. You want to talk about it cause it’s the most amazing thing in your life however nobody else will truly understand without having the game themselves. But it’s your favourite topic of discussion because it takes up a lot of your time so you keep talking about it, as well as not having much else going on because of the time spent on the game. That’s pretty much what being a parent is like "
ax0l26,"NAH- Its fine if you don't go to their wedding. After all, you didn't even receive a personal invitation so its no big deal if you don't go. But I also think you need to relax your attitude to your cousins not attending your grandma's funeral. You don't know what they were dealing with in their own lives. Funerals are for the living, not the dead, so I don't think its being disrespectful to your grandma by not attending. "
ax0m8d,"I don't think I acted too meanly and I did not yell. I did in a very annoyed but trying to be cute and jokey voice complain that he ate the last one and that he always does this. I definitely droned on about how annoyed I was longer than I should have. But we were having a good night so the tone was still light and did not result in an actual fight. 

Hope that helps! Thank you for your insight!"
ax0o9r,"YTA, she makes almost a tenth of what you do, she got you the sweet money-making job (dude, $10k a month. seriously?), her family let you live with them free of charge, and now you want to split the bills in half???"
ax0os6,"NAH, I'm autistic and if I were in that situation I would absolutely want the person to tell me this rather than just continuing to be uncomfortable. Say it nicely, be clear that you still want to be his friend (just not as closely), and keep the lines of communication open."
ax0pv2,"YTA you are an adult, if you don't like it, make your own food. And stop being a drama queen"
ax11gz,"NAH, your brother doesn't care, so it's all good."
ax12nu,"NTA

This is some r/EntitledParents bullshit right here. You put your point across assertively without resorting to being nasty about it. And you are right: those children should not be there, and should not be left to run amok. I have young kids, and there’s no way I would have taken them to that sort of bar at that age, if it was legal here. Thankfully, it isn’t. "
ax13aw,"YTA

You're fucking disgusting if you think that the appropriate response to an impatient woman is to leave a gross mess in, on, and around the toilet"
ax150s,Literally a shitpost
ax1any,"NAH, It was nice that your boyfriend likes your business and wants to be an active part of it and help you when he can, on the other hand its your business and you can run it however you want. As long as he respects you opinion (not agree, just respects your wishes) then it should be all good and dandy."
ax1d0t,Nah.  She probably just doesn't understand restaurant etiquette.
ax1dg7,"NTA

Shine up that spine of yours now - It sounds like your MIL has a habit of getting her way (tbh, your husband needs to put a stop to this shit now).   

I'll also point you towards r/justnomil and r/justnofamily - Something tells me you'll find a lot of people in similar situations that can offer tips and tricks there ;)"
ax1e5a,"YTA. The only reason she's staying with you is because she thinks she can change your mind in this ""in-between stage"" (from her POV). She can't healthily maintain a FWB situation with you at this point"
ax1ewm,"ESH. Stop calling your girlfriend emotionally and verbally abusive, those are powerful words and can seriously break a person's mentality when coming from a loved one. People have fallen into depressions for less. 

I don't know what she's done, you haven't expanded much on it, but I'll take your word for it.

Stop arguing over weed. If weed causes problems in your relationship then you are not using it in a healthy way."
ax1fso,"NTA

They're huge assholes for springing this on you and making it out that YOU are somehow in the wrong for not being grateful.

Fuck that.  Get out now, because tbh, if your fiance is this easily swayed by his parents wishes now rather than considering what you want as his future wife, it ain't going to get better."
ax1kai,"NTA. She wanted to make it up to you, so she had absolutely no grounds to be upset over a *$3 pair of earrings*. She needs to grow up."
ax1lf1,Nah.  You feel how you feel. Thats ok.
ax1omd,"NTA you deserve a work environment where you can thrive.  People have spoken up against this issue. She must understand the cause if she came back not smelling one time after being criticized. I understand mental illness but you nor your coworkers should be relied on to be able to work full capacity with a distraction such as that. Sounds like you have been empathetic and tactful. If it is interfering this strongly after so much discussion an intervention is neccessary, both for your and her well being. "
ax1op1,You'd be TA for not ordering pizza. These people went to work during a snowstorm. You might as well make it worth it for them.
ax1ph8,"YTA, he was angry over a break up and you decide to try and turn him over to police? What the hell? That’s a very poor reflection on your character. 
You got called a dyke... so you want someone to go to jail for smoking weed? You’re a serious ass. "
ax1qw7,"NAH

If an employer actually cared about employees staying long term they would offer them actual employment contracts.  But as long as employers reserve the right to fire you at the drop of a hat you get to quit at the drop of a hat.  This is a business relationship and not a personal one, treat it as such."
ax1stp,"NAH
 just talk to them, tell them you are feeling that way. and such a strong hatred of driving may mean that you might want to look into that further (medically/mentally)"
ax1tub,"NTA, your friend just way overreacted."
ax1xmt,NTA - your GF sounds like a manipulative bitch. 
ax21u1,"NTA- you bought the ticket; it’s under your name. If he can’t go, you should be able to find someone else to go with. He isn’t entitled to make money on it. He’s being ridiculous. "
ax22e8,"NAH from what you've written, but why don't you just propose to him if you want it so much?

Edit: Just to clarify one thing: NAH, but your communication with him about wanting to get worried seems to be lacking and I suspect that this will lead to you being more unhappy in the future."
ax23qv,[deleted]
ax25gm,YTA. That's kinda rude. You can be right and still have tact.
ax27cs,"YTA. SO MUCH YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE.

""Still expect"" ?! You EXPECT your girlfriend to go down on you? You're an asshole and a pig.

And trust me, it smells awful down there. You're disgusting. 

This cannot be a real question."
ax2bp3,"NTA you have the right to do your own thing, and you're old enough to live your life. They shouldn't hover over you and your brother. I don't think you should completely leave then in the dust, but you should be able to spread your wings."
ax2bzs,"NAH

Just give your friends a heads-up of what's to come. Im certain they've been in similar situations before.

Also politely talk (not confront) to your mom about asking you ahead of time. Let her know you don't think it's fair to alter your plans anymore then it would be for you to alter hers without discussing it first."
ax2dn1,"NAH

You did nothing wrong and you didn’t overreact, totally understand how it would feel like a violation of privacy. 

but landlady wasn’t doing anything malicious either.  she thought she was being helpful and she probs treated you like a daughter hence she didn’t think she crossed any boundaries

Miscommunication deff, but no assholes here"
ax2fk3,[deleted]
ax2hjz,"NTA for sure. Saving money is extremely difficult to do, especially when it's for something you dont really want to do. 2000 is a lot, and it's extremely unreasonable to ask someone to provide that."
ax2mnf,NTA - and good for you for not going along with something so shitty. 
ax2ods,"ESH although you suck less. You really shouldn't have judged the daughter without even meeting her, because you look more stubborn, but he had NO REASON to push you down and I think you're justifiably upset at that. In your scenario I wouldn't wanna make up either.

Re:stalking I think you're right to be upset by that, but I don't think that was with malicious intent from what I'm reading."
ax2s3b,"YTA. Sneeze loudly when you’re alone, and sneeze quietly when your wife’s around. No one likes to be startled by loud noises. "
ax2u4s,"ESH

Your mate for telling everyone

You for telling your mate.

Also you for your terrible grammar (jks). "
ax2vus,NTA. She told you she didn't want you. You were free to sleep with or date whoever at that point. It wasn't the best decision to sleep with someone right after telling her that you'd wait for her or sleeping with a mutual friend. But she was also way off base by saying that you would have cheated on her. 
ax2wti,"NTA, I can't believe they would treat you like that when you pay half of the bills in the house. They are right, you should move away, but because they seem like insufferable people and coexistence with them seems like a pain."
ax2yjt,"YTA and you know it, by that feeling of being “stupid” that you have. Your friend is right. You should have asked nicely or just left it alone. If you two are so close like sisters, you shouldn’t jump to assume the worst of her. "

ax38s8,YTA. He’s 6. Kids that age don’t care bout “work”. They just want to spend time with you. 
ax39h8,"NTA I think you're approaching it as well as you can and since you've been clear from the beginning I think you're being fair and reasonable! Make sure to stay calm like you are, even if it needs to be discussed further and if you keep making your feelings clear while also being open to things on their end I'm sure you can all come to a nice understanding ^_^ "
ax3bpm,"NTA - If he can talk shit, his fatass should be able to handle it.

I might even be fatter than him. "
ax3c9g,"NTA. I’d talk to dad and maybe a counselor about some of this stuff. She’s being shitty, but fighting with her might make it worse. Things change so much, and so much sooner than you think. Come up with a plan for if you actually do get kicked out. Best of luck. "
ax3f9a,"NTA

She could put so much crap in your name and then just ruin your credit. Don’t trust it"
ax3fer,"NTA. 

He seems like an opportunistic and selfish piece of shit. "
ax3haq,"NTA - You asked him to quiet down and 4 am is more than reasonable. He freaked out and you reacted at the same level, so bad on you for that part. But he started it.

Where were your parents through all this?!"
ax3mn4,"NAH if you slowly distance yourself or provide an explanation. 
YTA if you jump ship and cut her off immediately with no explanation. 

- Do yourself a big favor and distance yourself but not so much so that it hurts the other person, losing friend is tough. But what you're doing is infinitely harder to deal with and over time they'll get over not talking with you or seeing you as often. I've had a lot of friends stop talking to me due to being busy or moving away and they'll chalk it up to the same thing as long as you aren't suddenly mean to them. 
Good luck buddy, you gotta think about your own feelings over others sometimes!"

I'm not quite sure your dealing with an adult"
ax3pbd,"NTA. He's responsible for his own belongings even when he's in your store. You're not a guard; you're just an employee. And if he decided to throw a hissy fit, he's not going to get a good response

ax3pna,"NAH but your boyfriend needs to be more rational, less emotional. Go show him some definitions of ""social drinking"" and ""alcoholism"" "
ax3sf2,"Oh my goodness, NTA. Not at all. I’m so glad you survived that childhood hell. Don’t feel bad at all for cutting that toxicity out of your life.

It makes me even more disgusted that your mother made your “coming out” trans all about her. Sounds like a narcissist on some levels! 

Take care of YOU. Life is hard enough with family support. But with them being the abusers you’ve got to cut your losses and run to keep your precious sanity. Please take extra good self care, and most importantly; love yourself. You deserve all good things this life has to offer! ❤️

ax3wrp,"NTA

And, since that means that someone else is it’s your dad. Your dad seems to not understand that it’s your wedding and don’t want him there, which is your choice along with your SO’s. However, in hind (probably spelt wrong so sorry) sight it might have been better to give a different reason. 

Edit: spelling"
ax3yo9,"YTA. 
It took me several roommate situations while everyone was working their backside off to understand this: everyone in a household must pitch in to keep it livable. No matter how much of their contribution is monetary, everyone is equally responsible for non monetary aspects, unless everyone makes an agreement otherwise.

If you don't want to do chores, set aside a small amount for a part-time housekeeper. You're tired, that's valid, but you're still equally responsible for housework. Period.

I came from a lower middle class background. But when I was in my 20s I became debilitated with a large house to keep up. Turns out a neighbor lady i met really didn't want much to do a couple loads of laundry, sweep, and wash a few dishes. The rest was worth it. 

You're the asshole but it's easily fixed.

Edit: word fixes."
ax40ez,"NTA
Like you said, you are not financially responsible for her.
Also, 100% her fault for cheating on you in the first place. Especially when you dumped cash her way.
If she were smart she would have waited to graduate to cheat."
ax478y,"NAH

no assholes here, parents are being parents, they are trying to teach you about money and encouraging you to save. Also maybe a safety concern too

You are being a typical young guy who wants a motorbike (I also want a motorbike, but my wife and mother won’t let me) 

The best analogy I got is a colouring in book. No one would tell a 4 year old to stop wasting his time on colouring in books because in a few years time he will outgrow them. So why do we tell young men to stop wanting motorbikes, etc when we are in the phase?"
ax480c,"NAH

you just outgrew them, 

Mate I’m 28, I only still hang with 2 people from high school, and haven’t hung with any of my uni friends pretty much since graduation

My current friend circle consists of my current work mates and a bunch of guys I used to work with at a department store while at uni, all of us have since moved on, but we all still the best of buds

You make new friends, and you lose touch with old ones. That’s just what happens

Tho gotta admit it’s a bit dog blocking them on SM, "
ax485z,[deleted]
ax4bak,"NTA. Shit manager, don't settle for that kind of treatment. You deserve to get paid reasonably for the work you do. Even prior to this, it doesn't seem like you were getting paid reasonably considering you were working full GM duties. They're trying to fuck you over, don't let that happen. Not even because of dignity, although that's a good reason. Just because it seems like you're a damn good manager and you owe it to yourself to work for a company that pays you to reflect that."
ax4len,NTA Why tho. Why is everyone getting a free ride from you? You should absolutely toss your parents...
ax4qcr,"NTA 

And he can’t legally do that, it’s probably assault plus way over the line morally "
ax4qln,"YTA specifically because you refused to drop it when your friend offered to pay. How she handles her relationships with the bride and the maid of honor is her business, not yours. The only thing you’re entitled to in this is either your shoes back or money to replace them, which you were offered and refused. "
ax4tbt,I think we need more information than that to make a fair judgement. What was the misunderstanding about? How much has it affected your relationship?
ax4tj8,"NTA

If there’s a danger of K’s dog attacking yours, then her dog should not be on your property. Your dog shouldn’t be the one to be locked up in its own home because someone else’s dog is aggressive towards it. 

I would lay this out for K very clearly and politely: tell her that your dog is entitled to roam free in its own home and that it’s not fair to your dog that it should be tortured by being locked in a room all day because her dog doesn’t get along with yours. 

Unfortunately, if you want K’s behavior to change, you’re going to have to take a firm stance on the situation and if she blows you off, you’re going to have to tell her that her dog is not welcome in your home anymore. If she’s a good friend she will understand and respect all of this, and if she decides to start drama over it then she’s not really a good friend."

ax60dr,"NTA. If you’ve had to deal with an abusive, addict of a father your whole life, I wouldn’t even qualify him as family outside of being your biological dad. I’d be happy too if the guy who abused me into my teens were getting booted out of my house too."
ax62jj,"YTA here. I get that you want to spend time with her and that you feel neglected, but you've just turned spending time with you into a chore that she has to fulfill to avoid being nagged. By calling ""dibs"" on all her remaining available free time, you are almost surely setting this visit up for failure. You'll get a lot more mileage out of being grateful for whatever time you do get to spend together than being ungrateful for the time that you don't."
ax63cy,"NTA, your parents assaulted you and your brother. You did the right thing"
ax63yc,"NAH Although breakups are almost always crappy situations, it’s important that you find someone who is right for your needs.

ax64fr,"NTA, you're letting your brother crash at your place for free and he's being picky about the sleeping arrangements? That's incredibly rude.

ax75cm,"NTA, it sounds like your mom just assumes that you will take care of her child. If she is a reasonable person you should just be able to talk to her, and tell her how you feel.

ax7atz,"ESH. She sounds really frustrating to deal with, but you kinda took the bait with your answer. If you want to show someone they can't walk over you, don't let them know they've gotten to you-- you can't show your agitation like that.

Imagine how much a response like that would drive someone like R nuts!"
ax7do7,NTA. You are under no obligation to attend an event that makes you feel uncomfortable. Your friend was a dick for questioning your sexuality. Sounds like this was a friendship that had just run its course.

These feelings are perfectly normal and I am sure there are a lot of people like you. In my opinion you should stay at home till you are old enough to leave as it seems you have other family members who are kind to you. Don’t let this one person take over your life.

Stay strong brother."

Tell your girlfriend to try and help M find another date. Life happens and things change. But helping him can be a peace offering of sorts."

ax95oe,"ESH. Dude your WIFE IS CARRYING YOUR CHILD. Get. Them. The. Fuck. Out. Now. Black mold is detrimental to ADULTS, think of how dangerous it is for the baby? 

Your dads a lazy asshole, you’re an asshole for letting your pregnant wife clean while she’s near due. Figure something out. Do not let a newborn into a mold infested home. The fact that your father is the painted jerk of the story is astonishing. "
ax962o,"NTA. Dogs are wonderful companions, but they need to be taught and trained with manners, not completely spoiled - and it sounds like your mum is failing in that department and has no intention of doing so herself. It isn’t the dog’s fault, but rather your mum’s negligence. 

In the meantime, I’d recommend always closing the door to your room when you leave, and train the pupper to understand it is a “no-entry” zone. You can also considering bringing up the subject of puppy training school (which is offered by many pet stores) if your mum doesn’t want to do it herself. "
ax98sh,"I’m gonna say NTA simply because I think you need a doctor, a female one if possible, to see if there’s something else going on (uterus wise). I’m a little concerned for you. "

ax9bol,"NTA

You make valid points, but people like your friend just don't understand that the stuff they say is incredibly sexist."
ax9c9e,"NTA
It's uncomfortable, but I think that this is the best way to go about it. You could show a bit more compassion towards the parents with something like ""I am sorry to spring this on you"" or ""I realize this is uncomfortable, but I felt this was more respectful to your family than just taking legal action immediately.""

Even if you don't though, you're still not the asshole. She should not loan money she doesn't plan on paying back.

EDIT: my comment was made based only on OP's initial post. It has been brought to my attention, that the borrower's age is 30. This does not change the fact that, depending on the law of a country or state, the next of kin of the debtor may have to pay back the debt. I personally still think contacting the person's parents is not a bad idea, as long as it is done respectfully and with a clear understanding that they do not have to jump in in any way."
ax9k9f,ESH - it sounds like neither of you can communicate or work on your issues in a healthy way. Maybe seek marriage counseling if this is such an issue.
ax9mlv,YTA (YWBTA). It's not a library. It costs money for them to make and maintain a nice environment. The trade off for you enjoying that space is making a purchase.
ax9n8t,"YTA. Grounded until she brings up the GPA is really difficult because she has to wait until more grades come in. At her age (12, right?), a few days of grounding and the knowledge that if the grades don't improve more consequences would follow would be much more appropriate.

She likely feels alienated from her friends and misunderstood by you. "
ax9ql4,"NAH - he's probably busy and not really thinking about your sensitive feelings in that moment. When you're good friends with someone, you don't always need to say thanks. It's just unspoken. I do things for my best friend and vice versa all the time and we don't say thank you every single time.

ax9uat,"ESH

They suck for not paying you back.  Obviously. You also kinda suck for being upset about not getting a specific gift.   Be grateful for what you get and move on. 

You are also learning a very important life lesson. You don’t LOAN family or friends money. You gift them money and if they pay you back, that’s a gift too. It’s not fair but it’s how life works.

You can only afford what you can afford - There's no sense in a vet clinic pressuring you to get further testing that you can't afford.   I lucked out with my current vet who, when my last cat was nearing her end after a chronic disease, straight up told me that he would never suggest someone go into debt to pay for treatment that might not extend an animal's life all that much (though that might have been because I was openly crying at his office because I couldn't afford several hundred dollars in blood work)

The best thing you can do is take care of your kitty, and give her the best possible time you can for however long that may be.

And the next time the clinic calls, tell them to not call back or you'll be reporting them to the police for harassment.  That should shut 'em up real quick."

I'm not gonna emotionally manipulate her or abuse her or call her shit out or guilt trip her because it wouldn't help anything.

You were there for your free meal. It just turned out that way. Of course it was awkward, but I think she's being childish. When you break up with someone, you don't just stop ever going to places you might potentially meet. It's a restaurant. You haven't been in contact so you didn't know if she still worked there, and it wasn't even her usual day. It's crazy of her to assume that you'd just never ever go to that restaurant again for any reason whatsoever. ""Oh no, I can't go there, my ex used to work there."" You need to move on and live your lives. It sounds like she's still hung up on the breakup after all. "

Each example was more alarming than the last. His behavior is creepy and you made the right choice for yourself and the other girls. The blacklist exists for a reason and shit like this, my friend, is the reason. 


Edit: 


I think the fact that he has autism could make some of his behavior more understandable but I’ll say this: every high functioning autistic person I know has worked on learning social cues and on being aware of boundaries. Some have had to work very hard since it doesn’t come naturally. The fact is that he is old enough that he’s had time to get a few ideas down, such as not taking things out of others’ pockets and not continuing to message a person after they’ve been asked to stop. He may not have realized what he was doing when he adjusted himself but that was a red flag to me. 

Yes, he may be having a harder time adjusting to college life and being around girls in a new environment but IMO, he crossed a line by continuing to message you and by creating a new account to message you on. This tells me that he either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about your boundaries and either way, it’s not okay. 

If there’s drinking at these events, which it sounds like there is, then having a person who doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about boundaries becomes all the more dangerous. "

Essentially, this is the old neckbeard trope of feeling you've ""earned"" her romantic affection and feel cheated when you weren't paid what you felt you were owed.

His behavior is neglectful and since you're cutting him a break on rent already and know he can afford it, I think it's completely reasonable to ask him to contribute to the recarpeting. 

That said, make your spouse deal with this. This is above your pay grade as an in-law. Recompense from 50-100% is reasonable.

Everyone here voting he’s not is missing a key point. In the video the person didn’t JUST use the word.... they used it as a homophobic slur AGAINST someone who was gay. 

I would agree with OP that if someone just uses the word fag it doesn’t inherently make them homophobic, but that they should consider the implications of casually using it

The fact that this video showed someone calling another person a fag, that makes them homophobic. If you use a slur against someone who the slur pertains to.... that’s the definition of being homophobic. 

Also, I agree she probably was a little intense, it’s hard to tell someone they’re going overboard on a topic that directly relates to their lives and safety. 

Hope this makes sense!

Your title is misleading. You aren't upset because of his past you are upset because of his *lies about* his past. 

He completely fabricated part of your relationship by basing many statements to you on lies and endangered your health that way as well by giving you an STD! Not cool, bro.

What else has he been lying about...?"
axjpxh,"NTA. But it's still not your job to deal with it and blackmailing her isn't the right thing to do.
Your husband needs to talk to her and solve this, if she still tries to contact him he should get one of those things that forbid her to contact him."
axk33i,"NTA, it's a totally reasonable request and he is being childish at best and manipulative at worst"
axk7m0,"NAH. Just an unfortunate situation. Sex is meant to be enjoyable and fun, so it's fine for you to refuse especially if you feel tortured by it. Great to see him not being imposing, you two sound like you have a great marriage. Good luck :)"

axl3te,"YTA, but only a little.

Unless you were flying under a different baggage policy than the one I’m used to, your carry-on suitcase is for the overhead bins, and your other smaller bag/item is for under the seat.

You checked your carry-on suitcase to free up overhead bin space, and then used overhead bin space for something that wasn’t supposed to be in there.

The guy got his case sorted out though so it’s not a big deal."

axlfwz,"NTA your birthday is your day, mother's Day is hers. Next mother's Day tell her she should buy you a gift because without you she wouldn't be a mom. See if she likes it."
axlilo,"YTA. I swear there was a post just like this about valentines a week or two ago. 

Dude, spending one evening a week with your GF of a YEAR is really not much time. Work out five times a week and spend two nights with her. That is still plenty of workout time.

I fail to see how you can’t workout and see her in the same evening as well.  Care to explain that?"
axlk45,"YTA. 

Obviously something is causing your friend’s grades to slip. So, instead of lecturing her and nagging her like you’re her mother, reach out and be a *friend*. Ask her what’s wrong. Ask her if there’s anything you can do to help. Get a group of friends together to study together after school. "
axllt3,"NTA

axm3q7,"YTA

Only because you seem to relish these ""trophies"" more then being open and honest in your relationship. You've admitted that their high value isn't really what drives you to keep them, moreso the memories. Some of these items therefore are sexualized (as you mention being nude under the jacket) and trigger memories so strong of your ex and past events you do not want your husband touching you while wearing it???

This is crazy. And on some level you know yourself it's wrong (you do want your husband to touch you, but when he touches you while wearing this it ""feels wrong"") yet you continue to keep these items."
axm7to,NTA.  Wanting to be friends with somebody who doesn't judge and put down their friends is a normal and healthy perspective on life.
axmc9y,"YTA for getting upset with your sister, arguing with her, and trying to blame her decision on her fiance.

I'm not totally unsympathetic, OP. But it's going to take time to regain your family's trust. It's wonderful that you have one year of sobriety, but it doesn't negate all the damage you did while you were using. 

Have you made amends to your sister? Do you go to meetings? NA meetings will help you learn to better handle the fallout from your addiction. "
axmgb2,"NTA the venue might not agree with your thinking but if you buy the tickets you should be able to do what you want with them.

You asked if she could wait five minutes wich is very reasonable and you also said that if she really wants it she could do it so i dont she the reason why you are controlling."
axmk7q,"EDIT: Oh my glob. Your initial post really needed the info about the laundry couch, moldy tub, and gross, greasy floors! I think your wording made you come off a little bit like an asshole originally, but it sounds more like he's actively not helping around the house at all- just pursues hobbies and part-time school while you do all the bread-earning and cooking. Is that right? If you answer back and confirm that I've got that right, then I'll happily change my judgement to not the asshole. However- I do still think that it's not cool to dictate to your partner what they ***will*** do. As I said before- you're not their mom. Best to just sit down and say something like ""Hey babe. I know you're having a tough time with the layoff right now, but since I'm doing the cooking and spending 8+ hours a day at work, I would really appreciate it if you'd take on the following tasks."" And then ask him (nicely, with the same respect you expect from him) to do the chores on your list.

&#x200B;

Original response:

YTA- I think? but maybe I just need more information. I don't think it's wrong to divide up chores... but you really come off like you're treating him like his mother, not his partner. Did you just assign him these chores? Did you sit down and discuss this together and come up with this scenario? I mean... I think if you were a guy writing this about his wife, we'd all be saying you are the asshole, without any debate."
axmlr4,"NTA- and sounds like you dodged a bullet with the girl. I'm not a big chain restaurant fan, but driving an hour away for a hipster experience? When you have an early class the next morning? Nope. I think she was an asshole for the shitty text. "
axmmjr,"NTA! Wow. That is some truly, truly horrible shit she put you through, and I'm sorry. I believe that when she's sober she's lovely and that all the horrible shit is ""her disease talking"", but that doesn't make it okay, and it doesn't mean you have to subject yourself to it any longer. You and your fiance have to worry about yourselves too. Sorry you're all going through this! Good luck."
axmo0z,"NTA: That office is a shared space and not his home away from home. He needs to realize that it's not proper work etiquette and just bad form in general. Who clips their nails that often though???? I would talk to him first, then maybe the supervisor if he doesn't comply with that simple request of not doing it in the office. Just because he's been there longer doesn't mean he can't respect his fellow employees."
axmo85,NTA. And definitely not sexist. If you live there it is your responsibility to clean it.
axmokw,"yep- YTA. You had food, shelter, decent schools, love, and safety? And she did all that with no help from the father of her children? She already supported you, that money is backpay from what he owed her and didn't pay her for the last 18 years. Now... that said, were I in such a situation, I imagine that I would be spending a good chunk of that money paying (or at least helping with- depending on how many she's got) my kids' college bills, but that's me. I don't think you are owed that money, and I think YTA for feeling ""entitled"" to it.

axmy1s,"NTA - Who the hell needs it to be below 64 to sleep?  Wtf?  Does he just need a lighter blanket or something?  Plus, if 64 is too hot for him, can't he crack his window a bit or something?  He has no right to assert that the heat should be off for the whole apt because of his insane preferences. "
axn0kp,NTA it's a public spot
axn2m0,"NAH - It's understandable you don't want to bring her - this is a tradition for you guys and you can't hang out with your girlfriend 24/7 - everyone needs to be able to have their own friends and life occasionally . Also, being the guy who brings his girlfriend to an established guys night is never good.

She's likely lonely and wants to be included. Can you make plans another night with some of the guys outside of the regular meetup so you all can hang out? Do any of them have girlfriends? You could plan a group date so she could meet some of the girlfriends."
axn3be,[deleted]

axn8an,"NAH. He's right that there's nothing gross about using reusable rags and then washing them.  That is a completely hygienic practice, as long as the rags are washed appropriately (ask anyone who uses cloth diapers).  But also, almost everything we do has a much greater impact on the environment than the 2-3 paper towels that it might take to clean a toilet.  So it's a tiny, tiny impact and not something to feel bad about (unless you're using half a roll or more to clean, that's wasteful by any measure).  

I say this as a pretty rabid, but practical, environmentalist, for what that's worth.  "
axnby3,"YTA - Not because you want to hold a goodbye drink but to host it at a place where he is clearly not welcomed.  Seriously dude, say goodbye to him at a bar somewhere and save everyone the unnecessary drama."
axno6d,NAH - trying to do the right thing but in the wrong way. Everybody's reaction is understandable. Communication! It's key to avoiding scenarios such as this.  
axnor9,"NTA - him being gay has nothing to do with whether or not this is okay. If it makes you uncomfortable then it makes you uncomfortable, she’s you’re GF and he should respect that no matter what. Tell her about how you feel and ask that she, not drops him as a friend, but tells him to just watch his hands and keep to himself a little more. "
axnto5,"NTA, but I think it might be better to let your husband handle his side of the family to show that you're a united front. And maybe MIL is not the only one that needs to be cut off."
axnu24,NTA but I'm concerned about why you feel the need to police his attendance 5 YEARS after getting him the job. Unless you are his direct supervisor you should really leave it up to the company to decide what to do about it. He's not your responsibility just because you put in a good word for him 5 years ago. Let it go and let his boss deal with it. 
axnydb,"NTA - to be honest, if he was a good friend he'd offer to buy you a new one. 

Like you said, he's also a broke college student so maybe you can't expect a $80 bong back, but I think it's the thought that counts and he should at least try to make it up to you guys. Even if that's just smoking you guys up a couple times, or buying you a different bong"
axnzeb,NTA but addiction is a bitch. You were only honoring your original agreement 
axo1up,"NTA:

Faith isn't something that should be forced upon someone. She needs to be more tolerant.

axo8ft,"NTA - you signed up to help her SHOULD SHE NEED IT. If she can afford to donate 10% of her money to ANYTHING, she doesn't need your help. Case closed."
axo99v,"YTA- Jesus dude. You're a bully. He told you he didn't like it, he asked you to stop, and you keep doing it anyway? How old are you? 10? And now you're doing it to his kid? Just, stop calling him that. It literally costs you nothing."
axoa75,"YTA- come on man, you knew that he takes those for lunch, and you ate almost all of them anyway and didn't leave him with enough to eat nor any time to purchase more. That sucks.

axogzl,NTA run for the hills bro
axoi3n,"NAH (no assholes here): I’ve been on your gf’s side before. It wasn’t that I was jealous or worried that my SO would cheat on me, I had a very real sense of fear that something would happen to her and I wouldn’t be there to do a damn thing about it. From her perspective, I now see that she just wanted to look cute and be confident in her appearance. But in the moment I couldn’t see past the “what if?”. Personally, I wouldn’t have escalated it to the point of a fight, my gf ended up giving into my request (god bless her soul). I would really dive into this convo if I were you, see if it’s an overprotective complex or a jealous one. "
axoi3u,"ESH, but you're more of TA. Like, a lot more. You're a grown man, and you can't bring yourself to learn to fry an egg? Cook a burger? Make some pasta?

axp6ln,"NAH

You absolutely never have to apologize for your mental illness. Friends are going to help no matter what, and even if you feel like you can’t go on, they’re there to help you realize that life is worth living. 

That being said, I really really hope you do seek to help yourself. Of course it’s an uphill battle and it can get absolutely exhausting, but life is always worth living, even if you don’t believe that right now"

Your friend will likely change her ways after she steps out into the world a little bit more and sees how things are for herself.

I'm going to be straight with you. I hate religion, for this very reason.
Your friend is conditioned to think that you should give birth to a baby even if it means there's a chance you'll die. Why?
Because the man in the sky said so.
I think that's the most absurd thing ever.

Most children brought up with a religion will stop believing in that religion once they get some independence and aren't influenced by their parents anymore.

You shouldn't feel bad about your situation. I'm sorry that you can't have children."

axpijz,"YTA
It doesn't matter. He was her dad. All problems aside. If you really can't understand that, there isn't much anyone can say.
You knew you needed 48 hours. You should have told her you needed an answer now.

axpinm,"NTA. This is a delicate issue that is NOT your problem to solve, you’ll just push her away. Find a way to tell her that will get through to her that you are worried and suggest she may try and find a source of guidance for this.

Ultimately, if she can’t take care of herself, she likely can’t take care of a relationship long term. Good luck to the both of you."

axpwb6,"NTA. Depression, like with all ailments, can only be treated if the person seeks treatment. The best you can do is be supportive of her in any of her life choices (staying at her job or leaving, leaving her relationship or staying) but you absolutely do not need to indulge in her mind games. One thing about depressed people is it can get frustrating when we're acting out and not getting reactions. She could be purposely upsetting you because that's making her feel something, even if it isn't good. That said, none of it is an excuse for being an asshole. It might even be better for her if you drift away- it gives her consequences for treating you poorly, since clearly conflict isn't a consequence to her. 

I genuinely hope the best for you and your friend. "

I don't think you had bad intentions, but I think your priorities are a bit backward. It's clear you're a kid in school. I'm going to give you some depressing news of your own: it's like a million to one odds against your band ever amounting to anything, and you have no guarantee you're even going to win the battle of the bands. Essentially, your band is a hobby. 

If it were me in that situation, I'd have prioritized including my depressed friend to make sure he has social connections and a feeling of belonging, because those can be really important for a depressed person and to try to ward off any rash actions he might take in the future. If I was asked ""help my depressed friend and provide some comfort and support, or be marginally better at a hobby "" I know what I'd pick."

axqdiu,"This is a YTA just because of how you’re handling it.

It would be one thing if you just didn’t like it, that’s something you should’ve waited until after sex and just nicely mentioned you weren’t a fan of it. You did not need to make a disgusted face and tell her it was gross.

Also, not kissing after a BJ is generally seen as immature behavior, she loves you and is willing to not only suck your dick but let you come in her mouth and you’re going to refuse to kiss her after?

If this is surprising behavior from her and you think it might be due to her boyfriend influence,  I recommend being open to speaking with her again if she reaches or again.  You should include how the recent interactions made your feel.  If she's a real friend,  she'll listen and acknowledge her selfish behavior.   I'm hoping this works out given your friendship spanning years. "
axs8o8,"NTA - if she couldn't handle raising a kid, she shouldn't have had a kid. Not your problem or your responsibility. "
axs8sh,"It's understandable not to want what is basically a stranger at your birthday party, but it is a little on the bratty side for your biggest concern to be that she's gonna ""steal your spotlight"". If she's a nutjob, I'd be concerned that she's going to ruin the party with destructive shenanigans or scar you for life by talking about how many guys she sleeps with. "
axsazv,"YTA: This kind of behavior is what makes online gaming so toxic. You flipped out on someone over literally nothing, it was just a game. I understand being frustrated but verbally abusing someone because they didn't do what you thought they should do was shitty. Next time take a deep breath and walk away. "
axsbyv,"NTA, even if your sister's pregnancy wasn't planned (the fact that it was makes it all the more ridiculous that she is mad at you), suddenly changing the date on a wedding planned a year in advance is off the table. 

&#x200B;

Heck, it seems like she's even going out of her way to make it ""impossible"" to attend your wedding; if she doesn't come, that's on her, end of story."
axsd8s,"NTA for bailing

YTA for assuming someone being a virgin at his age is a ""red flag"""
axsdga,"NTA.
Also,  your SO's whiteness is clearly a handicap here,  he can't advocate for you,  because he doesn't understand where your feelings are coming from.  The good news is,  he CAN learn,  & you can help him do so. I've had to help my husband understand (he's caucasian,  i'm Latina) ,  but at times it can be frustrating, because he'll say or do things without thinking them through,  then realizes later how a non white person might see things differently.  We've been together for so long now, that he's been a witness to some of the disparity,  with myself or our children as the target,  & that has been (regrettably,  coz no one deserves to be treated like shit,  regardless of who learns a lesson that day) a game changer.  He has no issue identifying covert racism,  calling it out,  & advocating for PoC, without casting himself in the role of ""white savior"".
Also also,  I disagree with your SO, Varg did not apologize.  He said he was sorry,  but he didn't understand what nazis have to do with it,  or how it affects you.  That's a text book non apology.  If he truly felt like apologizing for his comments,  he could've reached out to you,  whether directly, or through your SO, & made a heartfelt apology that didn't end with trying to invalidate your feelings on the matter. 
Your feelings are valid,  & if your moral compass points you away from a racist PoS, you follow it. "

They’re the parents and need to put your wants and needs first. It’s important to you that you know your bio dad, they should have some respect for that even if they don’t like the bio dad. What they’re saying may be true or it may be exaggerated. 

I think that an ultimatum is an asshole move on their part. They should understand your strong desire to have your own knowledge of your biologically father. I think that’s a really and truly awful thing. It might’ve been more understandable for them to be upset if they didn’t want to take it that far. "

this is the third (fourth? idk) post of this nature today made by a newly created reddit account

dude whoever you are, just talk to your girlfriend like an adult"
axt35l,"NTA for the reasons you described above. Rather than eat when you’re not hungry (a skill I haven’t personally mastered, as I tuck into my second bowl of ice cream) there’s no harm in boxing your meal to eat later. "
axt5ey,your what? WTF is a DD?
axt6yh,"NTA - if you can’t watch the dog, you can’t watch the dog. The extra commute sounds pretty rotten, as well as the inconvenience of not staying in your own place.

I’d talk to her about two things - that you can’t watch the dog due to the reasons you said (such as commute, but there’s always dog boarding spots for Cookie), and also you’d really be interested in coming along. If she wants to know why you could come but not watch the dog, if you come, you’re not dealing with commute, you’re vacationing which you’ve already mentioned, and you’re spending quality time with family.

Maybe you should've talked to your sister before telling him but she shouldn't have done what she did so I'd say she's the asshole"
axta32,"NTA-

While you can’t force him not to follow his dreams, it is upsetting he would lie to you like that. It’s not fair that you got blindsided by a social media post, when in reality he should’ve told you so it could be discussed.

I’m not sure how serious of an offense you would consider this, but you’re definitely not an asshole for not being supportive.

THAT BEING SAID! If you choose to stay with him, you’re probably going to have to put aside your worries and your problems and be there and be supportive. It would be unfair and unhealthy to continue to fight about this and be upset with him the whole time he’s gone, if that makes sense?

axtsqk,"NTA But I think theme being your “gamer” friends is irrelevant to the issues they have. They just sounds socially inept in general. I’m not expert so I don’t know if that’s something that can be fixed. I have lots of friends of varying interests, and yeah, I wouldn’t go to a bar looking for dates with some of them lol. It’s cool to have friends you barhop with and friends that you don’t. There’s nothing wrong with that.


That being said, damn dude, can I go out to the bar with you and these friends? It sounds like a hilarious time lol."

axu9a6,"NAH. Relationships involve the setting of boundaries. You asked her to wear a certain type of clothing, and she said No. You're not an asshole for asking, as long as you're not trying to push or persuade her. Likewise, you wouldn't be an asshole for dressing the way you want. Your GF sounds a bit more asshole-ish for insisting that her requests are somehow more pure than yours, but again, that's up to you to go along with or not. "

axux7u,"ESH

Your in-laws for being condescending asshats

You for going 0-90 in 10 seconds on the confrontation. (If you're in one of the places where cunt is bad then that was also bad.  I'm assuming that this is a situation where everything built up for a while.)

Your wife for obviously not having discussed how your illness presents with her parents.


Overall, this was an easily avoidable situation."
axv0wp,"NAH

It’s perfectly reasonable for you, as his girlfriend, to be concerned about his health and safety. You’re right to make gentle suggestions to him.

He obviously doesn’t have to accept your suggestions. If he’s set on eating poorly forever, that can be a dealbreaker for most people, since most people don’t want to watch their SO die from making poor health-related choices."

axv3oa,NTA - That boy needs a WORLD of therapy. You did nothing wrong; he did literally everything wrong.
axv3ou,"NTA-
Your parents made it clear it wasn’t a gift, and they’d she’d have to pay it back, so she shouldn’t have been shocked. 300 dollars over a year and a half isn’t that much... less than 20 dollars set aside a month... 

I’m sorry you ended up losing a life long friend, but it doesn’t seem like she was being a good one. Even if she was just embarrassed about not having the money, I’m sure she could’ve handled it much better considering she knew you and your family for so long. "
axv88y, NTA - they’re not your friends. Screw em. Do exactly what you want to do and stop letting them take advantage! 
axv8rk,"NAH

I can see why your mom would want you to change it to the new family name, but I also see why you'd want to change it to your mother's maiden name. 

It's your last name, you should get to choose it."
axvam7,[deleted]
axvbak,"YTA - kind of. All of this sounds terrible. Your husband put you in a terrible position. 

But here’s the thing. He’s gone. Why pass on the pain and animosity he felt in his life (in regards to his family) to his son? 

He isn’t asking for money or anything ridiculous. Just something to make him feel closer to his deceased father.

It’s not his fault that your husband held a grudge against a child who was leveraged in a divorce between shit parents. 

It’s not really your fault but I think you probably made a bad choice here. 

Edit: I want to be clear. I don’t think you’re an asshole in the traditional sense. But in the context of this sub and the situation you presented that’s the only option to express that I feel this was the wrong choice. 

Edit 2: please stop blowing my inbox up with “I think you meant XXX not YTA” ....I’ve been on this sub for a minute. I know what I meant. I get that you don’t agree with me and that’s totally fine. But it’s getting tedious. "
axvbql,"YTA here. Not because of your anxiety, but for being a crappy friend. How hard would it have been to shoot her a quick message to let her know what was up with you? 

And stop using facebook as an excuse. You could have opened messenger or texted her directly and never had to look at facebook at all. "
axvcfr,That literally directly contradicts what she says in the original post. 
axvdn7,"NTA - you’ve always been honest with her about how you feel and you’ve done nothing wrong. She crossed some lines and developed some unhealthy expectations, and didn’t treat you very respectfully. 

I was the Sam a couple months ago, or could have been, but I saw the signs and dipped out of the relationship early so as not to sink a year plus into something impossible. Sorry she couldn’t do the same for you, but know you’ve done nothing wrong."
axvdvc,"NAH. Child pornography is a really big problem, and it’s always better to be safe, especially for big platforms. It’s too risky to let somethings go by— even if it isn’t a big deal— because of the risks involved. You’re not an asshole you did it innocently, but it’s still too risky for reddit. "
axvika,"NTA, geting your mom to talk to you about things when she isn't under any kind of affect is a smart move. It sounds like there's more going on behind the scenes which you don't know about though. I'd ask exactly that if she keeps acting like that"
axvlyu,"YTA - you chose to permanently damage someone so that you didn’t have to feel vulnerable. 

This kid will second guess every relationship he is ever in because of your selfish desire to seem unbothered. 

Good work. You’re an asshole. 

Edit: To OPs edit....you could have salvaged this relationship if you had given him a chance to explain his thinking. You could have worked out a schedule to help him balance his responsibilities. You could have been a force multiplier in his life. 

But leave him alone. You fucked up and he deserves to move on from this. "

If you and Sarah are still close it would be in good taste to run it by her first. Just say you’ve bonded with her and would like to see where it would go. You don’t necessarily have to even ask for permission, but maybe just giving her the heads up so she doesn’t feel blindsided? Just an idea! 

Good luck! "

Him going into it with a defeatist mindset of ""well I have these problems and they're not going away so nothing I do matters"" is terrible, and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that will continue to wreak havoc in his life."
axvxpc,"YTA. This is a reasonable thing to be uncomfortable about but you chose to marry her knowing her background then shamed her for it. You want to be with her but you won't accept her past, you can't have it both ways. If you can't accept it you shouldn't have moved forward in your relationship. She can't get in a time machine."

axwb4f,"NAH - You're just a couple that's still in the middle of a bicker. I think you came here to see if people are more on your side or hers--doesn't mean either of you is an asshole. If this issue continues on and plays a larger, negative role on your relationship and you don't budge, neither of you is still an asshole, but you'll probably be sad."
axwgpo,"ESH

It's pretty typical self-defensive behaviour, like those guys who send unwanted dick pics to girls and then calling them ugly bitches when the girl turns them down. Your lack of response to her flirting has signalled rejection to her, so she feels she has to downplay things so she doesn't feel embarrassed. The only thing you can really do, if you want to remain friends/go for something more, is sit down and have a conversation about it. Although i'm not sure if I WOULD given that y'know, she called you ugly because SHE was feeling upset.

All that said, you really should have straight up rejected or accepted her instead of stringing her along."
axwhj6,"NAH. You just have different goals. Perhaps you two are not a great match? Either start communicating and work together, or consider whether it’s worth the hassle."
axwl5g,NTA but let's try to work on letting people know you're angry without cursing and yelling. It will save you a lot of headaches in the future. Especially because it sounds like you're a male? Men can sound scary to women when they yell. I had older sisters who terrorized me growing up but when I hit puberty my mom had to explain I couldn't yell at them anymore because my deep voice freaked them out. And it's a good habit to have for when you're dating.
axwr84,"ESH! Dump him and get out. You can't justify what you did, but equally do you even want to save this relationship when he doesn't respect you (ie by cheating on u) and you don't respect his privacy? There is no trust here. "
axwvv9,NTA literally just ask her if she’s getting a job because you’re worried that she might struggle to pay rent without one- say all this sympathetically and as if it’s all fine with you but you’re worried for her and she won’t think to get mad about it. 
axwy4s,"NAH

axxcdn,"NTA, your friend is an incredibly shitty person if she knowingly goes after men in relationships. and making a comment about your own husband is BEYOND rude as well. why are you still friends with her?"

axxew6,"Did you say you're both 23?

*Twenty fucking three?*

Holy Jesus...."
axxj4g,"NAH, I can understand that you're upset he disclosed something you didn't want to, however you didn't warn him in time and that's not his fault. Not the asshole for rescheduling either, if you think you're just going to be mad at him it's best to avoid that situation i think"
axxk93,"NTA, she doesn't seem to be putting in an effort to know the people who are important to you"

~~Looks like the comments are dominated by people thinking YTA or ESH, so I'll just leave my verdict~~ (EDIT:  look how the turn tables lol)

(EDIT 2: thanks u/moonjunkie for pointing it out, corrected my comment)

People arguing that it's petty because you're talking about 10 Euros somehow skipped over the part about the principle and how your brother *refuses* to pay it back, not ""I don't have the money yet"" or ""whoops sorry I forgot"".

He should learn sooner than later (probably later in this case because he's 18 already lol) that words have consequences and you should hold up your end of an arrangement if there is one."
axxy3f,"NTA. Assuming you've talked to him, explained how he made you feel, I'd do the same thing.

axy020,"NTA. It’s extremely presumptuous and self absorbed of them to just assume that you’d move back home to house sit/take care of their dog while their on vacation for 6 weeks.

Yes they are your parents, but taking care of you as a child is literally their job - you didn’t ask to be born! I say stand your ground and stay in your own apartment. It’s extremely selfish of them to expect you to inconvenience yourself for 6 weeks while still paying rent with the added expense of an hour commute twice a day.

Also not impressed with the passive aggressive comments from your dad. A glass of water and just expecting someone to house sit for 6 weeks for free while inconveniencing themselves are two completely different things. "
axy05t,"ESH

axyh0j,"NTA

Wait, how does 'going to school full-time' equal three classes a week?

However, you're leading him on a little bit (not enough to be an asshole) because you aren't telling him the jokes are too much and that you're not interested in sex.

 First of all, speech impediments do not equal mental disability. And it sounds like you’re thinking of mental disability as something negative. 

Second, having thoughts and judgements, even negative ones, aren’t necessarily bad as long as you don’t act on them and you then learn from them. Next time you know to not judge someone so quickly. "
axzn8j,"NTA, shit like that happens and it's no secret that people do these kinds of things. I understand why establishments need to restrict bathroom access but it's a double-edged sword. It becomes social taboo to ask about bathrooms without paying, and it fucks over anyone who buys something at a place with no bathroom.

Them being super mad is what makes them assholes about it, like this isn't anything rare or weird at all. "
axzone,"Bit confused if the school takes stealing seriously won't they investigate it not you? Like why would you be looking at CCTV? Why wouldn't the school look at the CCTV and get the guy, why would you need to tape him confessing?"
axzrvq,"YTA. You are wrong. You’re are basing your decision off what you read on a warning label.  Do you know the specs on those power strips? On the cords? Not all strips and cords are the same and some absolutely can carry the load of a space heater. Next time address your concerns not take action that hurts all.

Further, under a watchful eye, it may be worth the risk. Either way it’s not your unilateral call to make. "
axzt7t,"NTA mother or not, you're not required to carry another's burden. "
axztlr,"NTA. You did not get a job so that you can support your mom. You got a job so you can support yourself and your future family.

axzvxi,"NTA.

There are a number of valid reasons for staying in the car while it's parked in a parking spot. Like waiting for someone else. Making a phone call. Looking at a map. So sitting in a parking spot--even with the car running--is perfectly legitimate.

Second, the non-stop honking: she's clearly being impatient and rude. You waved her off, she continued to try to pressure you to leave when you didn't want to. Telling her to fuck off after she laid into the horn?

While perhaps not the best choice of language--let's be realistic. She was laying on her horn, right? She was trying to pressure you into action you didn't want to take--by irritating you with the horn, right? In her mind, probably the only acceptable outcome is for you to sheepishly turn on the car and slink away into the distance, right? She certainly wasn't going to move unless she clearly understood the situation, right?

Yeah, to me, ""fuck you"" or words to that effect seems entirely within bounds."
ay01ta,"NTA

If he lied or embellished the alterations to the screenshots then you have cause from the very man accused to believe that he is likely guilty. You should not abandon him without good reason, just know that you can save a life if you're there and you truly believe he's innocent. If he refuses to show you on the spot, you've got to be honest and tell him how it looks and that you can't associate with him."
ay0ap6,"NTA. There is no fairness involved here, they aren't entitled to anything."
ay0b2e,"YTA simply by KNOWING you should report it but not doing it. It seems like you want someone else to make the decision for you so you don't have to deal with the ""guilt"".   Those kids need to be better taken care of and you're knowingly allowing it to happen because ""you're not ready""."
ay0dpe,"NAH, but you're being very smart, OP. What happens when you get sideswiped on the way to school or the kid falls down your stairs while cleaning them and the kids' parents sue you for everything you're worth? The liability is way too much for you to accept without knowing/talking to the parents."
ay0hot,NTA: No one is forcing them to buy you a drink. If they think buying you a drink is going to get them into your pants....then that's on them for thinking wrong. 
ay0jd4,NAH for health reasons it makes sense to throw the cupcakes away.  As long as you explain why you threw them away and that they weren’t safe to eat I think what you did is the right thing.  He may be upset because he put effort into it but it’s better for anyone to not get sick.

ay0jlb,"NTA - He gave you something he didn't want.  If he want reciprocation, give him two skin you didn't want and call it even.  It is unreasonable for him to want something that you want and put forth effort to obtain. "
ay0oc2,"What you should do is finally break down and scream, ""WE DON'T KNOW, OK!?  We dressed you in the same outfit one day and accidentally shuffled you around and now we don't even know which one of you is actually named A or B!""  Then sob into your hands for a few minutes and for the next few days insist on calling them combinations of their names."
ay0oo6,"NTA

Open relationship means you have every right to believe it's not your child. Better to do this before the kid is born rather than years down the line."
ay0q7h,"YTA. Why are you wanting to scatter the ashes alone, not involving his daughter whatsoever? As a son who had to make all arrangements for my dad after he died when I was barely an adult, the thought of someone disposing of my dad's cremains without even informing me makes me feel sick to my stomach, and that was almost 20 years ago.

There's more to this than you're telling us. If you can't bear to part with a few grams of ash to the man's *daughter*, whatever. Take her with you to the ocean. 

If you dispose of his cremains without even informing his child you are more than an asshole. "
ay0qqa,"No, she is the asshole and sounds like there is a lot of work to do in the relationship"
ay0qu4,[deleted]
ay0thd,[deleted]
ay0tr3,"ESH. You don’t really have the authority to “let” your bf do anything. He shouldn’t be talking negatively about you to people, especially to his ex. "
ay0usx,"YTA. ""Hey person I don't know, do you want to be an accomplice in my theft of services? *Hey why so hostile?*""

You got the exact reaction you should have expected when asking a stranger to commit a crime for you."
ay0wg7,"NTA

There's no reason why you have to tell your boss the second you know.  You were complying with what other people in the company suggested you do, which is beyond reasonable."
ay0x3r,NTA - She cried over that? And she’s calling other people weak? What a child 
ay0ydo,"ESH - they both sound awful to be honest. Joking about a dead ex is esepcailly low, so I think May is the bigger AH, but Josh is also isn't the greatest. "
ay0ze9,"Based on what you're saying, I'd say you're NTA. If she was over the line, that's her fault. Either her husband is just enabling her crappy parking, or alternatively, she parked like that because someone next to her parked shittily, in which case it's sort of understandable and there'd be NAH. But overall, I don't see how the situation is your fault in any way. You parked in the lines in a valid spot."
ay11vg,"NAH.

You don't owe anyone a conversation.  They are not assholes for trying to start a conversation about a mutual interest that you are publicly displaying."
ay14q8,[deleted]
ay19ml,"So to summarize:

Your son wants to go to a memorial for his friend.

- You can't make it due to PTSD from 15 years in the military
- Your wife can't make it because she wants to hangout with a friend.

Your wife says you ""need to be there"" for your son, but TBH you have a perfectly good reason for not going if it's too emotional for you. Your wife on the otherhand, should BE THERE for her son and reschedule with her friend.

You are NTA, your wife is."
ay1aw9,[deleted]
ay1boh,"NTA - She broke up with you, you waited a couple weeks, you started seeing someone. She then had the nerve to say you disrespected the relationship? Your relationship was over, so that's just a stupid thing to say. She's just upset you moved on before her. "
ay1doy,"NAH. you were a kid and did something stupid for attention, and honestly who didn't at that age? it didn't hurt anyone either. it'll probably end up a funny story you look back on and laugh. maybe they'll all feel that way too if you ever bring it up."
ay1f78,"NTA, that ""its complicated"" is a huge red flag. especially if there was no hesitation. "
ay1g9h,"NTA. We talk to people about our problems to get good advice, not to get some shitty blanket statement and then have our personal issues plastered over Facebook."
ay1jne,NTA Sounds like college. If you are super close with him I get how he feels jealousy and resentment.  But ultimately everyone who’s single has freedom to act on their attraction.
ay1r3x,"NTA

Completely ignoring that she is not entitled to have you do work for her, an interview is competitive.  You would be actively sabotaging your own chances by helping her.  This whole exchange is honestly ridiculous."
ay1tyw,"NTA: Being a service member doesn't automatically let you choose your seat on a plane that isn't your assigned seat. You paid for those seats and deserve those seats. Don't feel guilty, he was being an ass."
ay1vo8,"NTA at all. Wow. Those people aren't your friends at all, if they're seriously forcing you two to be together even if you don't like the guy then that's just fucked up. Just flat-out tell him that you don't like him, it's easier than it sounds and most guys can take it."
ay1zhq,"NTA

As her father it is his responsibility to have a relationship with his daughter. Yes you can encourage him to, but in the end, it falls on him. 

Maybe to help you can talk to your ex about having your daughter call him, I know it’s not ideal, but it’ll get him in on the phone with her. It doesn’t even have to be a real conversation, she is only 5. It could be as as simple as a “I love you and miss you” 

Source: father of a daughter who live with her mom. "
ay20dz,"NAH - you're just a long-term couple with potentially different sex drives. if that's a dealbreaker for you, you might have to part ways. bUt right now it doesn't sound like something you can't recover from. "
ay228f,"NTA - not your fault they have nowhere else to go because her boyfriend has drama. That's their problem, not yours. "
ay230y,NTA - It sounds like what your wife needs is a job of her own.
ay27op,"NTA in any way, your friend sounds like she needs a reality check. She may not be very responsive to it though. I feel for M"
ay28sd,"YTA my dude, your wife probably isn't having an easy time on her meal plan. It wasn't about saving brownies for her or not, have you thought about how she feels knowing she wants them but can't have them? Have her back on this."
ay29oa,"ESH

What is this relationship? You want to **marry** this woman, but you don't share finances, a car, or even a bed?

She sounds pretty irresponsible; you sound like you don't even want to be with her. Of the two, I'd say you're the bigger asshole."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
ay2flr,"NAH, for big purchases it's completely normal to ask for that. Just frame it as ""I do it with everything big I sell, just in case""."
ay2pd7,"YTA - sorry he treated you badly but that doesn't mean you get to destroy his property. He was just a jerk, you committed a crime. "
ay2vez,"YTA - you fat shamed your daughter into an eating disorder and then denied that it was an eating disorder on the grounds that she was still fat. You were a huge asshole before the nose comment, and now you’re a colossal asshole, asshole. "
ay2y0a,"YTA - Just a little.

I'm going to assume when you say you're asexual you mean:

>Zero sexual contact of any kind.

Now maybe that's different for you, maybe it's just no sex, but kissing is okay, I don't know your personal preferences.

----------------------

I will compare this to someone who wants to wait until marriage before having sex and treat it the same way. Sexual contact is expected in most relationships in this day and age. Since you have a different preference than the heavily established norm, I think it is your responsibility to make a potential relationship partner aware of that difference. I dated a girl for 6 months who said on the very first date ""by the way, I'm not having sex until I'm married, so if that's an issue with you I don't want to waste your time"". It wasn't an issue for me and we ended up breaking up for a completely different reason 6 months later (never had sex).
"
ay2yu9,"NTA

>that he ""could have gone the rest of [his] life without knowing that.

Sounds like your dad doesn’t want to face the truth and take your side over your stepmom’s."
ay31dy,[deleted]
ay32ia,"I was expecting to say you're the asshole, but definitely NTA here. Your gf said they still have feelings for each other, and in a monogamous relationship this is totally unacceptable. It'd be fine if things ended and they rekindled a friendship of sorts, with no romantic feelings, but that doesn't seem to be the case. You would only be possessive and jealous in a bad way if they were completely friends. "
ay348h,"Hmmm..... NAH-

I’m going to assume it’s probably not even something that’s crossed his mind. He obviously has you listed as his wife, so he’s not hiding anything! Maybe just bring it up to him casually, open the discussion. Hopefully he’ll be receptive as it’s truly not a big ask.  "
ay34rj,"ESH.      

You weren’t an asshole for declining her advances, but you were an asshole for not giving her and her friends a ride home(unless you felt physically or mentally threatened).          

She should’ve stopped when you first told her to stop, but sometimes you have to literally sit them down and say, “sorry, but I don’t ever foresee us being together.” If she still acts weird after that, ghosting her is an option, but leaving the whole group 30minutes away with no ride is a little far. She definitely sucks, but yours is more circumstantial.         

I hope you make a smooth recovery from your ordeal, and maybe learn about how to communicate with others in stressful situations."
ay359l,"NTA, but as a mom I’d find it a little off putting and that might have contributed to her weird answer. There’s a dress up day nearly every two weeks at my child’s school. I’m busy enough, a new costume for everything is a lot to keep track of. It might’ve felt like you were mom guilting her. 
 
Respond with “just thought I’d offer! I’m sure she’ll look great 😊” and leave it at that. "
ay363n,"NTA, your friends were making inappropriate jokes that you were extremely uncomfortable with. Your friend S escalated this to the point where you had to tell her off. That is on her, not on you"
ay380k,"NAH. You need to do what's best for your own mental health, especially with you being in college. He needs professional help from a trained therapist which you cannot provide. Staying in the relationship just because you feel guilty leaving isn't good for either of you. "
ay393z,YTA. This is just you going on a weird power trip disguised as “trying to help/ teach her a lesson.” 
ay3et6,"NTA

Are they your kids or your parents? Plain and simple. 

You can build this build up into a more blown out of proportion but it is what it is, your decision. "
ay3gfn,NAH. Simple misunderstanding and miscommunication. 
ay3gh4,"NTA.

Abuse of people with disabilities is real and rampant, and it needs to be addressed, no matter who commits it.

**You** did not get your cousin fired. You made the report, and your cousin was fired based on her actions. Your cousin got herself fired."
ay3gs7,NTA - she chose to have her kid; that responsibility doesnt auto-transfer to you just because you’re related. Tell her your free time is your own and to start looking for other babysitters; you’re no longer willing to be the default backup mom.
ay3gzh,NTA. You don't owe anyone a gift. 
ay3hi1,"NTA, that guy overstepped. You don't owe him anything in the first place."
ay3kdp,"NTA. The store has closing hours and unfortunately the child's parents have to teach their kid how to work within rules and society. It's also not your store, so it was smart of you to be strict because it could make you look bad or get you fired. "
ay3kkc,"NTA, that's pretty disgusting to be honest"
ay3o7v,"NTA.  Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!

"
ay3ps6,"NTA.  Maybe your friendships are different, but I can't imagine talking on the phone for more than an hour.  I've only done that a few times, and always with my girlfriend.  Even then, there's a lot of intermittent silence, and neither of us are offended when the other says, ""I gotta go.""  It's a little weird that your friend doesn't recognize that people might not want to stay on the phone for over an hour."
ay3pyx,"NTA- neither you or your daughter. When teachers show favoritism or in this case, also is rude and mean to other students they need to be called out. "
ay3qov,"ESH. She shouldn't have grabbed it like that, but you also have to realize that most people aren't going to realize that sticky note doodles are important to you, and you really should have reacted more calmly. "
ay3rtc,NTA. Boundaries should be respected even with such changes.
ay3tip,NTA. That's quite an abusive relationship she's trying to put you in. If it would hurt to see her then don't. Your pain is worth more than hers.
ay3tk8,"NAH.  You ruined his used XBox, so you owe him a used XBox of at least the same quality.  Think about if you were in a car accident.  Car insurance doesn't pay you what your car sold for.  They pay you what it's worth now.  You don't owe him the value of a brand new XBox, you owe him the value of a used one. "
ay3zqj,"NTA

Sounds like by the way he handled it that's a complete made-up excuse you should not feel bad and he got what he deserves. Whether that really happened or not to him is completely irrelevant"
ay409k,"NTA, she is an adult and signed a lease. Better to figure out now that she cant sign a contract, and expect to be let out of it at her convenience."
ay4330,NTA. She sounds like a bad friend who can't respect your time or take no for an answer.
ay44gm,nta showing up uninvited and talk shit you can fuck off.
ay474p,"NTA. You were busy, seems like you offered what you could. "
ay47wf,"Okay. Don’t try to control a girlfriend. Instead, build a relationship of mutual trust.  Before you get to a relationship like that though, it’s likely going to be one hell of a bumpy ride. This is one of those bumps.  Learn from it."
ay4808,"NTA. 

You might or might not have any legal grounds for demanding money back, I don't think you would, but NTA for feeling used and mistreated here. 

You can ask, and I think it would be fair for her to repay you the money, but I don't think you have any legal standing to demand it. 

Sorry OP. Hope your future endeavors work out better. "
ay490n,NAH. You can’t be expected to mother your partner but your partner probably can’t care or pull themselves together right now. Try not to be too judgmental.
ay4b4u,"NTA - But honestly, it seems you aren't too bright either taking this guy back."
ay4du5,"NTA. This was a dick move on her part. It sounds like she was using you for a free meal. She is NOT your friend. Good riddance.

Call it money well spent to see her true colors."
ay4fx4,NTA. She sounds bonkers. Also who doesn’t bring their wallet on a date?
ay4gt3,NTA It's your book you have a right to get it back. If she lost it she should just admit that and buy a new one. If she just misplaced it and is too lazy to search for it that's just a dick move. Ask again. 
ay4hf5,"NTA - that is way too much to spend on a vacuum.  Hell, i have a dyson pet that I got on sale for $300 that does great for allergies and dander, and comes with many attachments. For another $200 I picked up a carpet shampooing vacuum.  So even if that does both, you are still seriously overpaying.  Who on earth would spend $2500 for a vacuum?  You could have your carpets professionally cleaned for years for that price, which would reduce allergens better than a vacuum.

Your wife told you that you weren't going to purchase, just let the friend do the demo.  She is now going back on her word."
ay4meu,"NTA..However, as a Prior NCO, all my troubled troops, had parental issues.  I have found that people that buck authority at home, try to buck it in the military, however that end in punishment, leaving the person hating the rest of his contract, and a lot do not even make that.  So please, if you are having issues with your parents and their authority over you, you might want to think twice.

&#x200B;

No matter what you decide, I wish you the best of luck"
ay4n6k,NTA that was a pretty awful thing for her to do and I think your response was perfect for the situation. It sounds like she needs to be trying harder to try to form a relationship with you. 
ay4ny8,"YTA. Honestly, considerig how prevalent phone addiction and social media is nowadays, combined with the way SATs are set up, combined with personally thinking about this, I can almost guarantee you that neither of those dudes were cheating. Not to mention, you knew your score wasn’t going to get cancelled even if they were caught because you weren’t on your phone. Overall, you really gained nothing, and cost those guys their test fees and scores because they probably wanted to check instagram. "
ay4rjd,"NTA but dude, I think he realises his mistake. I completely get why you are angry and you are justified, but I would forgive him."
ay4v1t,"NAH (except the artist in question). You didn't upset her, the artist's beliefs/actions/words upset her."
ay4wfy,"NTA I would say that its your world and you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. Especially sense you spent so long in it I see no fault in not letting him have a chunk of land. If you do give him one I would have a backup of the world saved somewhere else just in case something happens 🙃 

EDIT: you could also just give him a copy of the world file to mess around with on his own"
ay4yzt,"NTA, obviously. What fucking country doesn't have breaks for a 10 hour shift. Especially for a 17-year old."
ay50sx,"ESH, the dude definitely sounds like a lazy guy but it’s not your problem. Let your boss handle it, if he wants to. As long as he isn’t affecting you, stop worrying about other people’s business."
ay51ao,"NAH. You did him (and hopefully all his future sexy-time partners) a big favor. No one likes a bad kisser. He was probably embarrassed, but hopefully he improved his technique."
ay524m,"NAH, please don't feel bad! You are absolutely not an asshole for not affording a surgery. Like you said, they are a fairly big office. If they offered to take that loss it is because they could."
ay52ks,NTA I would never have made it that far.  Honestly are you not ever supposed to pursue your own interests?  Like geez once a month is one thing but to demand that much time is absolutely crazy.
ay576q,"NTA. He is for neglecting his poor puppy. He should be grateful. to you for taking care of his pet.

Is he doing a better job of it now? "
ay5cz6,"NAH. (Except the in-laws) Racists are not worth your time or effort and are toxic to children. You are doing the right thing. Unless your partner is upset by it, which it sounds like he isn't, don't worry too much."
ay5dwi,"NTA

You were being a good friend by checking his channel out. He’s being incredibly self-absorbed to not realize that most people wouldn’t find raw footage of Portal 2 of any interest. 

It made me think of [Lily’s play](https://youtu.be/YV5xbUEuzB8) in How I met your Mother. I think it’s reasonable to ask your friends to support your hobby. But it is not to push it, if they’re not interested, expect them to do it EVERY time, or to not accept valid criticism on their part. "
ay5gde,NTA. Your SO didn't keep his promise. How lazy do you have to be to where moldy dishes are acceptable?
ay5h32,"YTA - You're allowed to have your food preferences, but you're being an asshole about willfully refusing to even TRY things your wife has prepared for you. Does she have a point? Could you stand to be healthier for her sake, and that of your kids? Are you really modeling good habits for them to follow? Put in a little more effort here and try to expand your palate...you can still have mac and cheese too."
ay5hwu,NTA - she is out WAAAAY out of line. She is a disrespectful prick and I truly hope none of that poor man's family see those photos. 
ay5k87,"Holy 'O fuck, that dog needs to go to the vets"
ay5lb0,"NAH - I think you need to move out and move on, though. this doesn't seem healthy for you. "
ay5lei,NTA. He had 2 months to let you know he wasn’t the right person to plan it but he waited till the last minute. He’s TA for sure 
ay5nh4,"YTA if you approach this like ""you're wrong for eating a way differently than the way I eat"". It doesn't sound like she's eating *unhealthy* or anything just... weird (to you... and probably most people, lol).

As long as she's not harming her health, I don't see how you could possibly frame it because it's up to her what she wants to eat. Like ""Hey I don't like that so you should stop""? She's not making *you* eat that way. So let her live her life and eat her cheese in peace, lol
"
ay5nor,YTA. Not for taking revenge on your ex but dragging his best friend into it on purpose. I know he could have said no and be a good buddy but that plan was evil from the get-go.
ay5ptw,NTA. You shouldn’t be forced to deal with someone’s bad BO. Don’t ever feel bad for trying to find relief for something like that.
ay5q0y,"NTA, the guy basically stole your work and is profiting off of it, how are you the asshole for trying to get what you are due? 

&#x200B;

I swear, too many people don't seem to understand the value of the time and effort that goes into artistic disciplines, and it disgusts me. "
ay5q3w,"NTA

Phones are expensive and you would be taking responsibility for them. If something happened to a phone that was charging you could be liable. In this day and age I think it’s best not to take on that risk. "
ay5qa2,"NTA - if your class is graded on a curve, then you are particularly NTA. "
ay5rwq,"NTA - Not at all the asshole for not wanting to be around him, but abusive relationships can be really difficult to ""get out of."" If you haven't already, I think you should sit her down with your wife and tell her you are worried for her health and safety, and you're not judging her, but if she ever wants to leave she can call you day or night, and has a place to stay with you, no questions asked. A lot of times people stay in abusive relationships because they get increasingly isolated from family and friends, which is exactly what the abuser wants, because the victim then becomes even more dependent on them. Whatever you do, just make sure you two don't lose your relationship with HER."
ay5uoc,NTA. You can choose who you want to invite. 
ay5vwz,"NTA. She way overstepped her boundaries by calling your workplace. You're definitely not immature for admitting you wouldn't be ready for a child and realizing that incompatibility early on. Additionally, who brings up abortions on like the third date? (When you haven't even slept together yet?)"
ay5wfz,NTA was the promoter R.kelly? Sounds like he's already back at it.
ay5yf5,"Wow, NTA at all. It's one thing if it's all his money, but to ask for *yours* to send to her? That is way way out of line. The whole situation sounds messy and I'm not sure if you'll convince him since his ex appears to have him wrapped around her finger."
ay5z9u,NTA. Not his images and not even his design.
ay60lq,"NTA, threatening self harm to force a relationship of any sort, whether it is friendship, relationship or meme exchange, is abusive behaviour and is something you probably should disassociate with. "
ay61mp,"NTA, and honestly to me it's a red flag that he's suddenly giving you less money, what is he hiding?"
ay62cn,"ESH. Now hear me out before you spam downvotes, but autism isn’t really an excuse for those strange questions. You are the better person, and always will be. You should’ve just realized he wasn’t worth your anger. And that brother? He just thinks autism is an excuse. Fuck him. Almost every sibling of an autistic child would be fed up with it. "
ay62d2,"ESH. You, because your tone here makes it seem like your attitude in general is hostile and cynical, which makes me assume that when you 'tell them what you think,' you're doing so in a dickish way. Them, because they keep coming to you when they should know by now that they'll just end up pissed off.

It's fine if you don't want to give relationship advice. Because it *is* dumb to ask someone with no experience, and you clearly aren't interested in the subject matter so why they come to you is beyond me. I'm just getting the vibe that you're kind of a jerk about it which is unnecessary."
ay68ry,[deleted]
ay69bc,"NTA If someone hides behind their culture as an excuse to be unreasonable, they're the one at fault."
ay69wn,"ESH

He went too far by continuing to lay his head in your shoulder when you voiced that you were uncomfortable. 

However you went way too far by saying that is why he has no friends. I imagine that would be soul crushing and no one should have to hear that. "
ay6bi9,NTA - the person who barged in on you should’ve apologized once you explained that there had been an issue and you were currently in the middle of conducting the study instrument (sounds like a survey?) with someone else. 
ay6cj0,"NAH - It's nice when your SO posts pictures of you two online, but it's in no way an obligation one has to fill when being in a relationship.

For some people the pictures may not ""fit a theme"".

It would be a red flag if he never mentions you on his social media, but posts about his family and mates.

You could try having a conversation about how it makes you feel, if this is something that is close to your heart. "
ay6f0x,"sorry, YTA - Oh man, have I been there! Those cartridges are fragile! Thinking about them the wrong way causes them to crack! Weed etiquette (in my experience) usually dictates that if someone fucks up your stash, they should repay in trade, rather than in money. Ask to be smoked out for the next few sessions, and then: smoke something and chill out, because this will not be the last time the universe takes weed from you, and your friends will probably also experience their own weed-problems. Let it go, don't worry about it for too long, you can pay that kindness forward to your friend who (accidentally) fucked up, and you'll be paid back in kind, I'm sure! Otherwise, go find some new stoner friends."
ay6fzz,"LMAO you are your own cockblocker. YTA, dude. 

Obviously she wants it to just be the two of you. "
ay6j4u,"ESH. It sounds like your friend put in a lot of work but they should’ve been more clear if they wanted to get paid. You should’ve paid him once you said you would and not dragged it out and been petty. 

You’re both acting like dicks over $20. "
ay6jbm,NTA. Vaccines aren't always 100% effective. Some times you can still get sick.

Maybe drift a little further away from this though, unless you're fine with hubris catching up eventually! You don't know what you don't know, so be very careful around strange words my friend. ;)"
ay6qms,NTA. You have every right not to want that person in your home. Your husband can hang out elsewhere with said person. 
ay6tuj,"You‘re not the asshole for what you did, but you would be one if you didn‘t respond at all. It was probably quite a big step for him to write the letter (and give it to you), so it would only be fair to tell him"
ay6uiv,YTA. You invited him and then expected him to buy his own ticket? You should have made it clear he had to buy his own ticket. That’s kind of messed up.
ay6vqe,"NAH

Everyone involved in this still young and their minds are developing, yours included. It was not nice to throw the kid in the lake but he had it coming. "
ay6vu7,"NTA but borderline validation post, in what universe are you an asshole for charging money for honest work and communicating that upfront? "
ay6wkt,"NTA - you are learning some good lessons and this can build character.   The kids that are bullying are probably going to have even harder, much much harder lessons to learn later in life.  Stay true to yourself and dont ever wish you were anybody else.

For your own peace of mind, try to just ignore the bullies as much as you can.  They are on a dark path."
ay6wxj,"ESH. Him for multiple reasons. You for creating drama. Just break up, go your separate ways, and choose better next time. "
ay6xf0,"YTA - If you’ve decided that you can’t have fun with her or her friend there, you should excuse yourself from the group and make your own fun plans. If everyone else seemed indifferent it’s probably because they don’t want to take sides or hurt your feelings. Don’t be “that guy” who drags everyone down on what should be a great night. "
ay6zrw,"NAH you did something because of a mental health thing and everything turned out fine so no problems here really.

Edit: Also as a more supportive side note you don’t need to set a high standard for yourself mental health wise, do what you can do and try to be kind with yourself when you can’t and things will get a lot easier trust me.

Double Edit: oh boy didn’t read that bit right yeaaa sending another guy off after her when she asked you out really isn’t a good move but ultimately she’s forgiven you so I’d learn from it and move on."
ay71gd,"NTA. Sounds like he just doesn't like to. 

Ummm... you go down on him A LOT. Almost every time? Wow. Okay. There is actually zero incentive for him to go down on you. 

I've played those games. I had a guy who didn't seem to like going down there. So, every time he did... NEXT time I would go down on him. I don't even think he realized I went all Pavlovian on him. Haha. 

When he does... positive reinforcement.

Oh, and you might stop the head for awhile. ""Cuz you just don't feel like it."" 

Try some different new games that don't involve your mouth going there."
ay71j1,"NTA.. they’re sneakers for Christ’s sake... when does she want you to wear them? She sounds pretty controlling honestly, if I were your gf I would just be happy that you liked them so much to wear them "
ay73jq,"YTA, wtf you're going behind your friends back and dating someone who just dumped her on a whim, how do you think it's gonna end for you? Your friend's already hurt because of the fight and breakup, just wait until she learns her, ""friend"" encouraged him to end the relationship so you could date him? "
ay7c6b,"ESH

You shouldn't have tried to ship him drugs when it's illegal in his state. He shouldn't have been trying to buy drugs in an abnormally risky way (getting your drugs delivered by a federal company is a lot riskier then getting it delivered by your local plug)

Edit: Two letters"
ay7g9i,"YTA.  I've been in a similar situation back in my teens.  I'm now much older, the girl has moved across the country, married some other guy, but me and my friend are still cool.  He's one of my favorite people.  I'd hate to think about what things would be like if I had been ***too stubborn to forgive him for being pissed I was dating his ex.*** Take a moment to let that sink in and realize how ridiculous it sounds.  Forgive your friend.  I know he said he was cool with it, but you probably should have realized he wasn't. He probably knew he had to real reason to stop you from dating so he said it was cool, but that doesn't make seeing his friend date his ex suck any less.  The good news is he's ready to move past it.  Forgive him and move on.  Girls come and go, but a real friend lasts a lifetime."
ay7hd8,"NTA. You don’t control the industry. People typically choose to sell their items or exchange for a loan, and they are solely responsible for that transaction."

ay7mc1,"Wait, you decided you weren’t interested in a girl anymore because she had autism? What exactly about autism made you lose interest?? "

ay7qt7,"NAH—a little bit of alone time does wonders for us all, and you're in your rights to request that. But if his commute is stressful and doesn't help him decompress, he's right to say as much. See if you can discuss this together and work out a better compromise."
ay7vht,NTA. You had your plans first and they're not exactly something you can reschedule. Tell your parents to take your brother with if they're so worried. 
ay7vr3,"Hi! Professional horsewoman here!

You will be TA if you get involved. It’s not your place to tell anyone else that they are “too fat” to participate in anything.

As for the riding - this sounds like a dude ranch/trail ride operation for novices, and that is the assumption i will be working with.

- All places have weight limits for the horses’ health & safety. **It is up to the facility to enforce this, not you**. If the facility chooses not to enforce their limits, it’s their problem.

- I have never encountered a dude ranch place that did not have at least one draft or draft cross horse (the type bred for farm work, heavy-duty cart pulling, etc.) for exactly these situations.

- On a dude ranch, you will do a trail ride at a walk. There may be a short “gallop” for qualified riders, but there’s not much damage one man can do during one walk. Draft breeds can easily weigh *over* one ton, mostly of muscle.

- Even if this is a shady place that allows a heavy man on a skinny pony to bounce all over at the trot, **you will be TA if you get involved**. If you feel that the facility can’t or won’t enforce their weight restrictions, don’t go yourself - don’t support the business. But you will always be TA if you tell someone “I think you’re too fat so it’s better that we enjoy this without you.”

My relevant experience: over 20 years riding & working with horses. currently managing a 100+ horse facility (one of the best in my country). 8 years experience working at breeding facilities ranging from miniature show horses to Standardbreds & Thoroughbreds headed for the track. several years teaching riding lessons. 2 college degrees. 8 years of pre-veterinary study (including my pre-vet & horse management courses at a vo-ag high school). i’m happy to answer any further questions. (also i’m friends with a woman who manages a dude ranch in PA and has repeatedly confirmed all of the above bullet points)"
ay7xpp,NTA. It sounds like you don’t care to know whether he was or wasn’t because it’s irrelevant in your life. They could have thought you meant that you don’t care if a person abuses children generally though. Probably just a miscommunication on a really sensitive topic 
ay7xqy,"NAH, honest mistake I think but no problem wanting to find a new therapist. Might be the right call but doesn’t make them or you an asshole"
ay7xwq,NTA. Buy a lock day 1. And talk to whoever’s paying for the house (it gets more dicey if your sister is contributing to rent/utilities) about where your furniture is going. 
ay7yc0,NTA. She sounds emotionally abusive. You could use this as an opportunity to achieve independence from your mum.
ay7zrx,YTA. Some of the most puerile nonsense you could ever get into. You and your mate are total fuckin Muppets. Won't be long til you both get a reputation for being living enema bags. Well deserved too.
ay8166,"NTA, sounds like you needed to get tf out of there"

ay870r,[deleted]
ay8fnh,NTA- cruel and degrading? I think your dog is probably not in danger of developing a complex because of your behavior. You’re fine. 
ay8imv,ESH. Parenting and being in a relationship is not a tally sheet. It sounds like your system causes more problems than it solves.
ay8j3d,"I don’t know, dude. Sounds like YTA. You didn’t plan anything, you let yourself get bad sleep leading up to it, and it doesn’t sound like you even got her a gift. You put zero effort into her birthday."
ay8nvl,Lmao YTA but honestly? Same. Driving with highbeams is really dangerous in non-rural areas.
ay8onz,"Reduced risk of transmission is not the same as NO possible transmission. So he's misrepresenting the truth there.

Your body is not a charity you have to give out to people society seems worthy. Who gives a fuck if it's unfair. Your body is your own."

ay8ub0,"NTA Real friends wouldn't ask you to jeopardize your job, or get mad at you for your advancement. Real friends work harder to make their friends look better. Real friends understand that the job is the job and it is separate from everything else. 

She may be your friend, but she also may not be capable of separating work and private life. "
ay8ukd,"YTA. Legality isnt a consideration when determining who the asshole in a scenario is. This isnt ""who is technically correct"" it is ""who is the asshole,"" and you seem to be handling this in asshole fashion. "
ay8uu8,"NTA

It seems like there is something else bugging her and instead of addressing it directly, she is blowing up at you about something relatively minor like this. She was being quite petty."
ay967b,YTA. One wife is invited but not the other? Lmao.
ay99qd,[deleted]
ay9j7j,YTA - By your own admission “we” were having too much fun. You were roughhousing with an expensive piece of equipment strapped to your body. Lesson learned.
ay9m6n,"Yta for babysitting and letting one of the children play with fire!

ay9woj,[deleted]
ayaa7a,"NTA. You haven’t been in this relationship long, and there’s already a ton of red flags. It doesn’t sound like you’re in love. I think it would be fine to just call it off as “this isn’t working out”. You can explain why and hear her side, and it will be uncomfortable either way as ending any relationship is, but ultimately you’re NTA for just feeling like it’s time to end it."
ayag3m,"NTA - he's a grown ass man, he can make his own food. "
ayai6c,"NTA. I believe the story is fairly self-explanatory, if you mean banning ""random, drunk surprise guests."""
ayankb,"YTA but if you want to remain friends keep your mouth shut. 

Why the hell would you converse with someone about that at a works party?"
ayapy3,"ESH

Childish BS all around. What you did was wrong, but so was his behavior, so you certainly shouldn't feel bad in this context, but it shows good moral character that you do."
ayayhs,"NTA on the basis of what sounds like a *very* heated situation.

No adult should say that sort of stuff to their partner's kids, ever, period.

You date the person, you date the kids. She wasn't ready to date the kids.

You have to find a way to get through to your Dad as to what she's saying to you. What you just wrote here wouldn't hurt."
ayb4uj,"NTA

You’ve got no real obligation to toxic family, even if it suits their interests to make you feel like you do. I don’t really understand your brother’s reaction TBH - you did nothing offensive and were even being quite nice. Your niece has nothing to do with this and your brother guilting you with that is out of line."
ayb5fn,"NTA. 


As the person who will be carrying said baby and most likely being the care provider, it's your choice too. Stability and support is a must with children. 


It's a mutual decision and I'd really question your relationship if he's not listening to what are very valid reasons to wait. 


And I'm not sure if he's the kind, but make sure he doesn't try and sabotage any contraception just to get his way. 


Edit: just a heads up with the last point. The only reason I've mentioned this is because I've seen other posts where this has been the case and yes if it were to occur it would be sexual assault. 


I don't know these people, I don't know what runs through OP's husband's head. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. I've mentioned it as a precaution. OP has to decide if that is the kind of man she has married. We didn't get asked to judge that. 


If this has happened to you, I sincerely apologise if it felt downplayed. It was merely a precautionary mention to OP. 
"
ayb7m8,"NTA. If this has been happening for years, I'm surprised your coworkers have not noticed you prefer to keep a clean work space. You have every right to be frustrated that your desk becomes messy on the regular basis. However I'd not speak to management just yet; as a suggestion, writing a note on your desk politely requesting if your coworkers could leave the desk clean would be a good start. Because while it is asshole-ish to leave shit around your desk, they don't know it's bothering you. Start with asking them to stop and if this becomes fruitless, you have grounds to talk to management."
aybb85,"NTA. If you can't prove abuse, I don't know if you can. You can ask r/legaladvice for help."
aybemh,I would talk to your roommate but it also sounds like your doing all the wrong things for insomnia. 
aybii0,"NTA it’s not reserved for them. 

You may have severe anxiety which causes you to need a larger stall.


They are disabled, doesn’t mean they can’t hold it in for a minute the one day a year you are using the toilet when they need it simultaneously.

Even if they can’t, it’s not a reserved space.


However you will still FEEL like a gigantic asshole the day it happens haha"
aybld8,"NAH it sounds like your mum is proud of you and wants to show off. However, you don't have to play for her if you don't want to. Although, you mention you are at university and so I am guessing she is supporting you in some way. It seems like it wouldn't hurt to humour her as a kindness. "
ayblnf,"YTA for this clickbaity title. This story reads almost exactly like another one that showed up earlier this week about a trans woman during her flamboyant newly-out phase.

No to mention there’s no real dilemma here. You passively drifted apart, he moved away, no biggie, NA."
aybpst,"NAH but clearly your husband is suffering and it SUCKS that he had to be there alone. I’d be super hurt and I don’t blame him for his feeling and emotions at all.

I think you need to step up, own the fact that the party was more important to you than making sure your dog didn’t die without you and that your husband didn’t have to suffer that alone.  Your choice was reasonable, but it had consequences. Just because you’re not the asshole doesn’t mean you don’t have a lot of work to do helping your husband and kids through this."
aybrfn,"NTA.  It sounds like you are being treated more as an observer in your life situation than a partner.  It really doesn't sound like you were given much say in the matter, or that your feelings were ever a consideration.  It is understandable that your wife would want to help her mother, but if you were truly an equal partner then you would have equal say in the matter.

If you want advice on how to approach the matter, you might want to head over to /r/JUSTNOMIL.  The are a few people there that are a bit to eager with the ""cut them out of your life forever at once"" nuclear option, but you will also likely get some more moderate responses."
ayc0or,"ESH

Why the heck did you invite this guy to your wedding after all this nonsense? It doesn’t add up. Cheating, lies, abuse, secret relationships, stolen rats. The whole story is sketchy and you all sound trashy.

FFS cut ties with him and his family. Focus on your current relationship and move on already."
ayc2iw,"NTA. Cheating is awful and if she ends up with STDS, that’s on him. It is a betrayal of trust and will fucks with a persons self worth. I’m happy you have morals, cheating is disgusting "
aycaf1,"NTA

If she brings it up again just apologise and say you’re having a small wedding for family and close friends only"
aycawp,"YTA for using capitals unnecessarily imo. But seriously, if the tailor hasn't done what you paid her for - tell her and take the dress. You asked for it to be done on a specific date and she didn't deliver. NTA.

Edit: actually re-read. You said it would take 2 weeks but you gave her a week? You said you took it in March 1st but then said it would take 2 weeks but expected it be done by March 8th?"
aycfxw,"NAH, you didn't know, you were trying to be nice, it was an accident. I can imagine the lady thought you were disrespecting her religion though."
aychgb,"YTA - you can do it at any moment, why would you choose specifically his moment? "
aycih1,"NTA

You have no obligation to loan people money, your reasoning is inconsequential, it’s your money."
aycm7d,"NAH, if you feel the relationship is turning toxic, it's better to end it."
aycqth,"YTA. ~~I know I'm going against what almost everyone else has said, but~~ I don't see the problem in just...letting them each walk alone. You have this idea of how things ""have"" to be, and they don't. You could even have someone who just walks her up the aisle (and one for him) and then goes back to their seat and never participates otherwise in the ceremony.

I know ""your wedding your rules"", but regardless of whose fault you decided the breakup was, I don't think it's right to make your *best friend* walk arm in arm with her ex-boyfriend after a nasty breakup for the sake of appearances. I think that's a real asshole move. If you want your friends to celebrate your love, forcing them into uncomfortable situations to look pretty isn't the way.

edit: when I posted there were like 10 NTAs and one other YTA, removed the part mentioning that"
aycrdw,"NTA the guy should not have left it in your air space.  Its unfortunate but tough luck, next time be responsible for your own shit."
aycusz,"ESH. You both should've used headphones. I'm slightly more on your side because you're right, you can take a phone conversation into another room, but not a TV. It's a dumb argument and y'all shouldn't waste any more energy on it. BTW, are you trying to sell V-Moda headphones?"
aycwsz,[deleted]
aycyf9,"NTA. To protect yourself, I would cut ties with these ""friends"" immediately. Remove them on social media, block phone numbers, etc. This is one of the few times I feel ghosting is appropriate. 

This might be a good question for r/legaladvice too to see how you can help."
ayd0rf,"NTA for not telling him about ex’s penis size, but your comments about how you’re settling and you “love” him because he takes care of you “like a mother” are really unsettling. Doesn’t sound like a healthy relationship"
ayd0yx,"NTA. Native gal here (mixed but mostly native). Idc if you say Indian or Native, or if you say something like ""actual Indians"" to dispel confusion. I have had many conversations where halfway through I realized they weren't talking about me at all. She's looking for a problem where there isn't one."
ayd2ox,"NTA. I mean, it’s not like you were bashing her parents or suggesting they do something different. Simply saying that is weird should be understood, because that is weird. If you hadn’t mentioned the vacation I would have said YTA, but it does seem priorities are different in their family than in most with similar income. My boyfriends parents are the same, and I love them and all their quirky spending habits. Not my house, so what do I care? But I can still say it’s weird."
ayd4z3,"NAH - sexual attraction is part of life. You can’t control your thoughts. Only your actions. 

Out of respect for your husband, though, I’d stop seeing this man regularly. No good will come of him staying in your life "
ayd6as,"NTA - Sarah is tripping. She dumped you; she forfeited her right to care about who you talk to. You could make out with another girl in front of her and you’d still be fine. 

Sarah is an idiot."
ayd8r6,NTA he should have apologised for standing you up and he definitely shouldn't tease you with food you can't have because of his actions
aydbck,"Even if it's your ex. Of course you can tell your friend that you'd feel uncomfortable, but you're not in a position to forbid it."
aydbu1,NTA - addict needed a wake up call you did good.

It's your health. Who deliberately goes into close contact with other people when they are really sick? "
aydof2,"NTA 

Absolutely NTA. People dump dogs in their house and assume they kinda do their own thing if they’re older than puppies. Dogs need to be trained, if your parents didn’t feel like doing that themselves, that’s why they having companies that do it for you. Ask nicely and be polite, I’m sure it will be fine :). Please update! "
aydpv2,"That was incredibly painful to read and really just a scattered MESS of thoughts.  


But NTA - this woman sounds like a dumpster fire, and I'd cut her out too."
aydqqs,NAH you were literally fighting it and doing everything you could to not laugh and they had every right to be annoyed with that
aye0c7,"NTA but your manager is - as someone who used to work as a cashier, I fucking HATED it when a manager would do that. They give us these store policies, tell us to enforce them, make US be the ""bad guy"" to the customer, and then when a customer starts treating us badly they...give the asshole their way! Wtf? "
aye6tj,"NTA for your feelings. But clearly your dad dropped the ball on keeping his account beneficiaries up to date- he should have changed that after the divorce. 

>But I know if my hubby and I were to split, I would want my children to receive most of it, not him.   

Then provide for that in your will and keep the beneficiary information up to date on your life insurance policies and retirement accounts that pass outside of probate."
aye7xq,"NTA

aye9e1,"NTA, if she thought you were still gonna take her to prom she probably thinks you're still not over her. There wasn't relevance in telling you that there was a bet in the first place, just seems pretty fucked up. "
aye9ta,"NTA. Your mom is being very inconsiderate and inappropriate, not to mention GROSS!!"
ayeatv,"ESH. There's a first class bathroom for a reason so that people who pay for first class can use it. I think everyone knows that, and you're TA for going up there in the first place knowing you're not first class. Your flight attendant sounds like she was doing her job, albeit a bit passionately-- up until she followed you as you walked away from the bathroom to lecture you. That was out of line since you got the message right away and left, there was no further reason for her to treat you like a child/harass you."
ayegz0,"NTA.

Better cautious than not. Make sure a parent is there tomorrow."
ayelao,"NTA- You are smart for making the decision not to get back into a relationship that was previously abusive. You are not responsible for her issues, but make sure you don't lead her on or contact her in anyway since it seems like she will take it as an invitation back into your life."
ayeld3,NAH - you shouldn't have a child you don't want; circumstances change and people are allowed to change their minds but it's better to tell her sooner rather than later. You have to be okay and prepared that this might be relationship ending and that doesn't make her TA either. Children are a huge deal and there is a chance she might not have married or dated you if she knew you weren't going to want another child. 
ayemyp,"NTA: 

He can't just forget your existence when it's convenient to him. He sounds like a real A."
ayen3a,"NTA - It seems like you have different priorities in how you view time together. It also seems like she doesn’t think your gaming hobby is as important as her spur of the moment request. I think you should talk about it together. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be picked up but if she expects to drop random requests and is upset if you are busy, you might need communicate why it is inconvenient. "
ayez6y,"NTA   Try moving it to the opposite wall first. 
I wouldn’t move it out of the room until you have an agreement on the alarm. I think you will probably get used to sleeping through her alarm if you didn’t even know the source of the interruption before she said something though."
ayf23b,NAH. It's your wedding; do what makes you happy. Be prepared that some people may not come if their kids aren't included.
ayf4ec,"NTA- I would’ve said “no assholes here“ except that they pulled the “extremely disappointed” guilt trip on you. That was an asshole move on their part. They made you an offer, you considered it, and politely declined. It should’ve ended there with no harm to either side."
ayfcwd,"ESH- especially your mom. It is her responsibility to take care of the pet she brought into the home. If she cannot do that, it doesn’t matter how much one of her children whines, she needs to find the pet a responsible new owner and make sure it is rehomed appropriately."
ayfg76,"NTA- but also, let this go. Don’t respond to people who pull this shit. Wedding planning is already stressful enough, don’t make it even more stressful by latching on to stupid, unsolicited, comments from nosey busybodies."
ayfl5f,They probably cheated on you.  NTA to be upset.  I'd seriously consider whether you need people like this in your life.
ayfzg9,NAH. Just don't get upset if she is hurt and decides to move on. 
ayfzsa,"NTA - there job is to deliver it to your apartment, not the parking lot. As long as you are tipping them appropriately don't feel bad. "
ayg1kd,"ESH - if you have a problem with your step mum, you tell your father directly.  Doing this was absolutely stupid!  And if your dad figures out what you did, he will never believe you again.  You said you are 17, that is almost an adult. You need to act like it and talk to your dad.  What your stepmother is doing is wrong, but what you did was worse - you deliberately made your father think you were in danger, and made him believe your step mom said it was ok.  That really was an asshole thing to do!"
ayg2e7,"Based on your description, NTA. Obviously you needed to stand up for your wife, and this dude has no right to come in and essentially mooch off your mom and try to act like he runs the place. Good on you for calling him on his shit, and hopefully things between you and your mom work out"
ayg31w,This is clearly OPs mother. 
ayg3ej,NTA as a former heroin addict. I can honestly say that you're currently doing the best thing for him. 
ayg73z,NAH. You both have valid viewpoints. Maybe purchase a cheap plain gold band. He’ll feel better knowing you are wearing one and you won’t have to worry so much about damaging/losing it since it wouldn’t be costly to purchase. 
ayg74g,"ESH - she can obviously be a recovering alcoholic and teasing someone about that is rude and totally not okay. Your friend may have thought it was a joke but it's obviously not something she's okay joking about, understandably. It was also not okay for your roommate to say your friend was not a real man but your friend came into her home and insulted her first. If he wants an apology I would say he owes her one first. Your attitude that it was ""just light ribbing"" is hugely problematic and also sucks - alcoholism is not a joke and he was your guest so partially your responsibility"
ayga3k,NTA - I have been in this situation before.  There really isn't a right answer for it.  I have lost a friend or two based on this and now I keep my comments to myself or keep them more broad in regards to the conversation.  
aygd11,"NTA - Your friend is being weird and possessive.  He's dated other girls in the past couple of years, and Jane is NOT into him.

Also to be upset like that and to ""ask what my intentions were with Jane"" is double weird."
aygg86,"YTA - She wanted to share a passion of yours, and you straight-up told her no. Why would you do that? Would you like it if she told you she wouldn't teach you to sail?"
aygh50,"NTA - fuck that guy. You do you OP. Go get white girl wasted and have a good ass time. 

At some point you’ll have to grow up and be a real adult. That time isn’t now. You should enjoy this period of your life and this guy sounds like a drag. 

Don’t let anyone shame you out of your good time. "
ayghv0,YTA. Not a huge asshole but you are throwing family out (at who's expense?) when they need looking after. He gets a pass for an outburst because he is ill and its a dickish situation to be put in. It might be a sensible thing to do but sensible and asshole are not opposite things
aygida,"NTA. I would feel the same way if I had a sister like yours. And 30 is not a special age to be making such a big deal. It sounds like she's 30 going on 13. I'm sure her bahavior in public can be cringe inducing.

You have your flaws OP, but you're a much more responsible adult than your sister will ever be and it sounds like you've had to endure her attitude your whole life. Good luck with the shit fit parade."
aygm3s,NTA- They are putting you through emotional distress and being rude to you.  You have every right to distance yourself to heal.  Let them come to you when they are ready to re-think their position of disowning you.
aygmeb,"NTA.  I disagree with the NAH approach, because the ""why the fuck would you say that"" response to an honest answer after she specifically asked for an honest answer is pretty immature."
aygqof,NTA 
aygsf7,NTA.  A couple of things though:  1) telling someone you're happy when you're not doesn't mean they can be abusive toward you 2) expecting someone who is abusive toward you while simultaneously crying victim to apologize for their bad behavior is an exercise in futility.

Do NOT feel bad. You do not owe any apology and you do not need to pity befriend him. Block the sister too.

ayh9zx,"YTA. You became TA when your friend said “hey that’s disrespectful,” and instead of trying to see it from her point of view, you valued your own right to use that word rather than valuing her discomfort. 
How hard was it for you to say “oh crap, sorry, I didn’t mean it.” And not use that word in the future? 
It seems like you won’t see eye to eye with her and probably best to go your separate ways. 

Btw, if you want to learn why it’s disrespectful, like another commenter said, I recommend “why I no longer talk about race to white people” "

ayi134,N(really)TA -  Next time you come across this type of the issue try to make it seem like it's your phone or a connection issue so the other person will be more likely to help you out. Saying that about their accent will put them on the defensive and everything will be more difficult.

ayi4sh,"NTA since you were clear up front about your plans and their limitations. However, the fact that she, a depressed person, reached out to you for company might mean that she was needier than she came out and openly said to you. 

If you have the emotional energy, it would be nice if you followed up with her today, either offering your ear if she needs to talk, or actually inviting her to come over to join you like you want to have her over (as opposed to the ""feel free to come"" non-invitation, which was appropriate given you had other plans, but may have left her feeling unwanted).

P.S. Please forgive her for silently stomping off. She didn't actually say out loud the rude things you imagine she was thinking, so at least give her credit for holding her tongue."

Seems like she was not joking and was just trying to use ""humour"" to introduce her fantasy. I feel for you, because I loathe when partners do this. It is hurtful and to think otherwise requires an extreme lack of awareness. 

You should feel special in a relationship and that you are the only one wanted by the person. I'm glad your SO apologized, but still. "
ayib3o,"NAH but realize you are suggesting she becomes dependent on you. And a lot of people want to retain their independence. Or would feel insulted that you would want someone to be dependent on you. As there is always the question - what do you expect in return. Are you going to feel you have a right to say what she can and can't do. Or does she owe you her body etc. 


To move to a new city, with little means and being unable to support oneself is a bad idea and can easily force her to not be able to leave if she wants. Especially without a support network like family or friends nearby.

ayj2mu,"So my background is HR and here’s my thoughts.

You are NTA if you report this. This is illegal, it’s theft and fraud. Eventually most companies find out. When they find out, they’re going to interrogate everyone and go through everyone’s timesheets with a fine tooth comb, dating back months if they can. You don’t want it to come out that you knew and did nothing. Trust me on that.

ayj4co,YTA.  You need to learn to control your anger or you’re going to have problems with it some day.  Real problems I mean.  Not just getting scolded by your mom and making your little brothers sad. They were just excited that you were playing with them and got carried away.  It happens.  
ayj4oy,"NTA as that's not your fault, but maybe you should drop her a call or something and just mention about your anxiety and how it was reflex. I can see how she might take it personally. "

ayj9bi,"NTA - This is a tough situation OP. But I don’t think it’s your responsibility to cater to the new SO’s insecurity.

ayju9u,"YTA for the way you said it, but not for the content of what you said. It is nice of her to try to help you out but it is OK for you to find it annoying. I would apologize to her if I were you and say - ""Hey, sorry I flew off the handle earlier. I meant what I said, that I don't want you to push me into flirting, dancing, or dating women. I know you mean well but I'm happy the way I am and it makes me feel like you're trying to fix me. That's why I got so angry, but I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. I really value your friendship and I like hanging out with you, and I hope you'll understand and respect my feelings on this."""

He's TA for putting you in that position. Let's be honest, it's manipulative. You said no, instead of respecting that he decides to make a public spectacle out of it so there is more pressure on you to say yes. It's not cute, it's not romantic.

aykwpp,"ESH

Sometimes you don't get to keep the friends you made in high school. People generally drift apart. Here's the thing. You went to that amusement park with your other friends. And then your original friend group decided they wanted to go because they saw how much fun you had and also decided not to invite you since, well you've already gone. Them not inviting you to the park might have been calculated, or it could have been a logistical choice, just like for you and they were embarrassed so they didn't tell you about it.

>What upset me was the fact that they felt like they had to keep a secret. To deceive me. 

I personally don't think that was a big enough slight to break away from a group, but to each their own. If you felt the need for a break, sure. That doesn't make you an asshole. 

But it was **7 years ago** and they're trying to reach out to you. You don't have to join their group again, but it's pretty petty if the above was the reason why. "

**Edit for anyone who doesnt read through comments: The girlfriend isn't on medication bc OP threatened her with leaving bc he doesn't want to be with a ""drug addict.""**

You can be annoyed at the symptoms of her 
ADHD, but it isn't fair to your girlfriend for you to hold her illness against her and accuse her of making excuses.  I'm sure she is upset with herself for making these mistakes and is embarrased about it.  Mental health isn't a one size fits all. Some people experience a downslide every now and then, and that is completely okay. Her medication may need adjusted or something like that.

 If this is just a fundamental part of who she is and she's been getting on your nerves for the entire time you have lived together...it might not be a good fit, which is neither of your faults. "

She should have been more upfront, but I guess she wants to avoid the ackwardness and harm that may come from saying your frequent need for support from her is annoying her. She may have reached a point where she felt more like some freebie therapist instead of a friend.

The reason Im using ESH is cause there are often social cues one can pick up on before it gets to this point. Like how a woman will often drop certain cues and body language to let a guy know she isn't interested rather then saying it out loud. I think you ignored the obvious. 

I also don't understand why you feel the need to take a break from the friend. Seems to just be stirring more drama just to avoid the possibility of losing him too.

Take this as a lesson. See a therapist and keep the problems there for ongoing treatment and feedback . Only reach out to friends when your in a really dark place."
ayl6zw,YTA. You lied to your partner. Fighting about money is a huge factor in divorce rates. You need to figure out why you and your fiancé aren’t on the same page about money and why you felt compelled to lie to him.

You are allowed to 'not be in the mood' and to express a desire to talk about something else, or ask if you could postpone the convo for another time but you should try harder to be more considerate. Your response to them saying ""I do it for you"" by saying ""you don't have to"" is pretty dismissive.

I’m genuinely so sorry that you’re going through this. It’s not fair to you, and I’ve been there with that feeling of just not quite fitting in with family. 

I think you are doing great by taking the first steps of just being open and honest, you confronted your mom and told how you’re feeling, and that’s a really great start. I’m not sure if you’ve already done this, but maybe next you can tell her directly “please invite me to the next vacation. Please give me a few weeks (or however long) notice so I can take off work. I will pay for myself. I just want to spend time with you”.

Being direct and honest is really your last option here. If they continue to not include you in things unfortunately it just means they are not good people, and are truly inconsiderate.

As much as I love animals, and it's not the dogs fault that she didn't train him, he still poses a threat to your child.
He already physically attacked you, so there's a high probability he'll attack your son at one point.

Plus, it's not only disgusting to have pee and poop everywhere, but it's also a health risk for a 7-month old who spends a lot of time on the floor and is taking everything in their mouth.

And let's he honest, the dog isn't properly looked after or taken care for by your girlfriend and deserves someone who will put in the time and effort it needs.

>I have told her for the last 6 months or so, on a fairly regular basis, that we need to find a new home for him [...].

You've been trying to approach the subject for months! And if she refused to see the problem and work it out together - for the safety of your son - I can completely understand why you did what you did. 
Therefore, you're not the asshole, but she is for having a dog and not taking responsibility for it and training it.

ayr839,"As long as you aren’t insisting you have an allergy when you don’t, NTA

My main issue with it is when people tell restaurants they have allergies if they just don’t like something - as someone who works with food, if an allergy is involved I have to do an additional clean down of all the surfaces and equipment, and work while keeping everything completely separate. It takes up a lot more of my time and effort than just leaving out or replacing an ingredient because someone is trying to avoid/doesn’t like a certain type of food.

But just asking about the ingredients of something is fine. Even if you said you’re intolerant (which is technically true if you can’t tolerate almonds) I’d have no problem with that because that doesn’t necessitate all the extra cleaning and separating."

Edit: It also sounds like this is more of a shopping issue than an eating issue. When staple items are running low or are gone, someone needs to go buy more.

Believe me, I have been through this twice and boy I wish my mom could have helped us out.

ayt9e4,"NTA. Growing up (pre-teens-early twenties) I had very severe depression, similar to what you described. I could not function, for a long time, in the most basic of ways. I was eventually hospitalized, but prior to this, both of my parents had a very hard time understanding how utterly debilitating depression is and the fact that it absolutely is not a choice. The psychiatrists I saw did a good job of helping my mother understand what I was going through; her attitude towards me changed and she became much more empathetic and supportive. My father however, did not. He grew up in a blue collar, “pull yourself up by your boot straps” type family that never discussed their feelings or whatever difficulties they experienced, and this paved the way for how he dealt with emotions and mental illness. This was not something we ever were able to get past and caused a huge rift in our relationship. Now that I’m older, I have an easier time empathizing with where his experiences in life brought him. He didn’t have the experience and understanding to see where I was coming from. I don’t know what your relationship with your parents is like, or what their upbringing was, but figured I would offer my story so that maybe you wouldn’t feel alone.  I absolutely think your father should be more empathetic towards you and what you are going through, but maybe your situation is similar to mine and you can see where he is coming from, and find comfort in that."

It would also be prudent to ask the rationale for apologizing to Sharon. Is she seeking an apology or is HR asking you to do that since as a subordinate she was placed in a difficult position?

And they should never ask for $400 donations.  In some cases,  there are occasionally suggested donations to essentially cover the cost of things (typically in parishes that struggle with donations),  but if you are a practicing Catholic you should know, costs should never be a hindrance to asking for anything.  If you are struggling financially and can’t pay for something like your kid going to Vacation Bible School,  the church will always find a way to pay for things.

I suggest using a phrase like “safe work environment where my privacy is protected.” that should perk up your supervisor and HR to how serious they should take this issue.

It unfortunately seems as though “avoiding conflict” is no longer an option with this issue and it shouldn’t be - you deserve your privacy and personal boundaries respected. Not only is that your right as an employee but literally your supervisor & HR’s JOB to ensure."

Maybe she never took the extra step, but it certainly isn't unreasonable that  she would try to stay on good terms with her good friend (your mom).

""Oh, I would totally cheat on my boyfriend this weekend, but we're sleeping in separate beds so I can't."" 

""I'm gay, but the only thing keeping that way is not sharing a bed with the opposite gender.""

Is that the logic here?

Edit: From one of your comments.

>He also doesn’t have flamboyant qualities or typical gay characteristics that would make me feel more comfortable about it.

I can't even describe how awful I think this sentence is.

You don't trust your girlfriend to not cheat on you. You think lack of alcohol or proximity to a dick is the only thing stopping her. Shit, you don't even trust her that he's gay. 

She didn't cheat on you, someone else did. But you are absolutely treating her like she's the one not to be trusted. You are being disrespectful to her, not the other way around. 

Edit 2: I'm pretty shocked at how many people seem to think a person's *sexual orientation* just changes on a whim or based on proximity or alcohol.

You are not an asshole for wanting your space back, but your friend is also not an asshole for having it rough. "
az8vxg,"Dude, no. NTA. Your teacher is the absolute asshole. I’m mad for you. "
az8yzv,"NTA, the fuckin guy waisted your time and wanted you to come out of your way to come back to sell your phone to him, fuck him "
az8z19,"NTA. Greg seems like he needs some legitimate help. His behavior shows strong signs of at the very least alcoholism and possibly some other behavioral disorder along with that. Like, strong strong signs. Ask yourself some questions here - is he really drinking and blacking out every day? Overtime, have you noticed a correlation between his drinking increasing and his behavior issues increasing? Are other stresses in his life occurring which may contribute to his behavior? Maybe it's time to push him to an intervention."
az8z7o,"YTA. It seems to me, and probably her, that you aren't willing to put in a whole lot of effort since you quit so quickly. Also, she may be seeing your reluctance to learn as possible reluctance to put work in other areas. "
az94al,NTA. NOT your fault this dude was a racist dick head 
az960o,"NTA

She's made it pretty clear that anything you tell her will be shared with anyone she sees fit, so the reasonable response is to act accordingly.  If it's not something you want her telling a stranger don't tell her."
az98er,NTA. What a horrible excuse for a human that shouldn’t be responsible for another life. It’s a puppy! They especially need to eat. I’ve had up to four dogs at a time and they’ve NEVER missed a meal. There might have been a couple times they got rice or something but they always got a meal. Hell I would’ve given them some of that pizza if it meant they still ate!
az99pf,"YTA. Of epic proportions. Talk to your wife now, but I don’t expect this is going to end well for you."
az9bys,"NTA - I'm not even sure why you're with this guy, to be honest. He clearly only likes the easy parts of the relationship (the part where he sits on his ass and you pay for him) and buckles whenever he has to put more than a bit of effort in. Imagine if you got sick again, or had kids, or had literally any issue ever - you'd be on your own. "
az9cq7,"NTA. She’s demonstrably flippant in entering and exiting relationships, it’s your right to be wary. You could’ve been honest with her, but this isn’t a high stakes situation, so there’s worse things."
az9kfr,"YTA since it was never guaranteed, but it seems weird that the friend would block the account if he had $1,500 on the line, seems like an easy excuse for him to keep it all to himself"
az9lxq,"NTA

But you can't stay mad until you come to the realization that Billy will never change. It's either he quits drinking altogether or you're going to have to put up with more nights of him like this. "
az9mct,YTA.  Holy shit that's not something you ask.  Ever!
az9ol4,"NTA - While I normally would think they're right since its their house their rules, they admitted that they're treating you differently because of your gender and nothing else, they're the assholes for having a double standard"
az9tc2,"NTA. You don’t owe anybody your time, your father doesn’t seem like he was exactly a model citizen so you should have no obligation to do something for him/his family.

As for the other stuff, I can’t really tell you whether you should tell your mother since it seems like a much more private and personal decision. "
aza0s5,"YTA if you actually try to get them to change.  Dietary restrictions are a common choice for Lent (and a common religious thing in general), so asking that her choice not to affect family meals (especially when the choice isn't very unusual at all)  is asking too much i think. "
aza0vy,"NTA.  You aren't judging him, you are judging his ability to do his job.  If he can't do the job and the job can't be modified so that he can do it, that is a real problem."
aza2j1,"NTA. Your mom is the asshole. Your GF isn’t a maid or an assistant, she shouldn’t be required to help your mom with her tasks every time she goes over. Good for you for sticking up for your gf."
aza3f1,"YTA. Massively. I understand you not liking people thinking that pit bulls are dangerous, but you cannot compare that to racism, seriously. That's like vegans that compare eating meat with the Holocaust, it's just not comparable."
aza6gh,"NTA! You were looking out for everyone’s safety, especially considering there had been a fire before you definitely did the right thing - let grumpy people continue being grumpy "
aza70l,"NTA, dude get the fuck out of there. You might as well live in a cage at the zoo."
aza9dw,"YTA - your friends are correct.  the ""you"" in ""are you ready to order"" is a collective you.  if you know not everybody is ready, you say ""*we* need another minute"""
azaa81,"YTA everyone (majority) does it, but it’s still an arsehole move. It’s understood within the group that it’s ‘jokes’ but casual racism/sexism or poor taste jokes at the expense of people with disabilities, or vaginas/penises are still racism/sexism etc. Every time we make or overlook/laugh with someone else making that kind of joke, we make it that little bit more ‘ok’ or acceptable. 

We shouldn’t do it, some of us cringe internally/externally or apologise for making the jokes, because we know it’s wrong, some people don’t think there’s anything wrong with it at all.

Still shouldn’t do it."

azaf6g,"“Not into it” is pretty mild...for example, do I LOVE giving my bf blowjobs? Yes...but because I love making him feel good, not because I love sucking on dick. You don’t seem to really have any strong feelings about eating your girlfriend out, just “not into it.” I know you said that you told your gf she doesn’t have to go down on you since you don’t go down on her, but you accept it because she “wants to.” She wants to make you feel good, she’s not dying to get a penis in her mouth. Be a little generous. "
azag3w,"NAH - Getting annoyed with someone you're married to is totally normal and it's gonna happen over something stupid and small and insignificant.  Just don't let it get out of control.  If these things aren't a big deal, then let it go...who cares what his favorite color this week is?   If you have ""proof"" of something (like one day he texts you that his favorite food is X and today he says its Y), show him the text and tease him and ask him which is true...but don't make a big deal about it because it clearly doesn't matter.

It's just his personality, take a step back and try and understand why you're getting annoyed with these things.  Are they really that big of a deal or is there an underlying issue you're ignoring?  "
azambg,"NTA. Your sister was just venting. Often when people are upset they say things they don’t really mean. At the time she didn’t want you to give up your life but, grief stricken she probably wishes you had, to help her. "

azaxpz,">Who even gives cash as wedding gifts?

Tons of people.  When the couple are adults and already have a household or two of stuff they are combining why would you give them more shit they don't need?

Better to give them cash for stuff they actually need in their life than another food processor or blender they won't really use but just put on the registry because that's what's expected."
azaz6p,[deleted]
azb03r,"YTA - you aren't ""covering for her while she's gone""; she left and they are your chores now.   "
azb4fe,"NTA - this is a little incoherent and rambling. 

But it seems like she’s dishonest about her partying habits and spending quality time on this dudes bed with him. 

You probably shouldn’t have snooped through her phone but it sounds like she probably gave you enough cause for concern in this instance. "
azb6c2,[deleted]
azb91w,"NTA. Friends don't share sensitive information like that with other people or use it as a way to insult/embarrass you. What she did was fucked and if I was in your position, that would be the end of the friendship. "
azbct6,"NTA, water polo is awesome. Your gf is just being insecure. "
azbeeh,"In my opinion, NTA. This is mainly because they chose to leave and their academic career isn’t your responsibility regardless of why they left. You can be annoyed if they lied to you, but if you refuse to help them just because it was church related is an asshole move. You can be an atheist and respect people’s beliefs at the same time. Nonetheless, their education is their responsibility. "
azbkgc,"Protect your cat. Maybe put it in another room.

As to the rest, honestly it seems like your friend's shitty partners are pretty much part of the package with him. If you can't deal, you're not the asshole for cutting them both outta your life. If you'd like to see her less, maybe talk to him about having some just-friends nights. "
azbkta,"NTA. Not controlling, not being an asshole, just a difference of opinion, I guess, in what proper table etiquette is. The reason I'm choosing this one instead of saying no assholes is because I think the silent treatment and behavior afterwards is petty and unwarranted.

If a loved one told me something small I was doing was rude to them and made them possibly think I didn't want to be around them, I would most likely change that behavior if it literally has no impact on my life."
azbppt,NTA for the love of god don’t do it. They are looking to control you 
azbq18,NTA a taste of her own medicine

azbyaz,"YTA if you’re not going anywhere that night. NAH if you are. He has the right to take a shower when he wants to. 

Also, I don’t think his comment was out of the blue. He works hard all day and he probably finds it annoying to come home to a girlfriend who doesn’t work complaining that he smells. "

azc3ho,"SHP

>He scoffs and shrugs his shoulders at the cashier and makes a mocking laugh.

This is either bad fiction or SHP validation. You're going to break up with him anyway. "
azc55v,"Not really, no. I’m going to say in general NTA, because you didn’t technically do anything wrong. Your girl probably just feels like you were lying, or left her to go to the concert without an invite on purpose. I get where she might be coming from, but you’re probably fine, as long as this friend isn’t someone that your girl has an issue with. "
azc81f,"NAH. I understand both of you wanting to spend the holiday with your respective families. Keep in mind, also, that your wife is still dealing with hormonal shifts and probably feeling very much like she needs to be with her family because of that. This could change before Christmas. Have you considered hosting Christmas this year so both sets of grandparents can be with their new granddaughter this year? Congrats on your new addition!"
azc83p,"NTA. You wouldn’t be an asshole because you’re entitled to ending a relationship for whatever reason you so choose. However, realize that this sets a precedent making your brother feel as though he has a say in who you date. "
azcafd,"NAH. You might consider asking your husband if he actually wants to lose weight, or if he's just looking for reassurance that it doesn't bother *you*. He might be feeling a bit insecure."

azcdgz,[deleted]
azcfki,"YTA. If they are kissing, why even try to join. And she denied you. Accept it. You can't force a girl to like you."
azcfsn,ESH - Your family overreacted by pulling the internet. However I think it would’ve been good if you gave your family an estimated time for when you’d be done. I am imagining them sitting around a cake without you and just waiting not having any expectation of when you’ll be back up
azcj9u,NTA. It’s disrespectful to purposely refuse to call someone by their preferred pronouns. People suck and I’m sorry you have to deal with it. 
azcq86,"Definitely NTA. I mean on one hand I feel like I would have just sent my mom some photos by now, but that doesn’t excuse her at all for keeping those old photos up after being told several times how you feel. It’s petty and immature. Hope you can sort things out with your mama, OP. "
azcsvr,Obviously NTA because they jumped to the conclusion that you’re making fun of them. Just leave it alone and it’ll blow over or if you want to be petty report them to the university especially since they’re blasting you on social media. 
azcth6,"YTA for lying.

Just tell her that you hate her dad. "
azcuzs,"NTA, but this one is a little difficult. As somebody who used to be a total stoner, I never felt like smoking weed inhibited my driving. However, scientifically, that is probably false.

Additionally, if you do get pulled over, if the officer can recognize that your boyfriend is high, then it’s a DUI, the same way that drinking is. If it were something like cigarettes, it would be less dangerous, but would still be a distraction.

Also, if the pipe requires you to use both hands, like any pipes I’ve ever used, then it’s absolutely not appropriate to smoke while driving. Even if it’s legal to smoke weed, putting other drivers in danger, even if it’s only 1% higher chance of an accident is totally unacceptable "
azcxgf,"NTA. What does your facial hair have to do with him? if you decide to have facial hair, it is YOUR body and your choice."
azcxhs,"NTA. ""White privilege doesn’t exist because every race has privileges, like Asians being smart and and black people running faster"" is a racist comment whether he intended it to be or not. I'm not going to say he is always an asshole, just not well informed about race and privilege. He seems to have taken the idea of having white privilege as a personal attack.  "
azczc2,YTA for fetishizing mixed-race children. 
azd02v,"NTA if it’s like Pandemic Legacy, where you play it over multiple nights and then you can’t play it ever again once you’ve finished. But I would bring it up before you purchase the game. 

A lot of people here probably don’t know what legacy board games are, which will probably skew the results to YTA. "
azd4x6,"NTA. I had a friend that was very much like this (but maybe a little more discreet about her selfishness). She was someone I considered one of my closest friends and I would do anything for, including setting up all her doctor appointments, feeding her, getting her jobs, counseling, and providing housing (her father paid rent).

I basically became this girl's mother/therapist while she never cared about me as a friend and would get upset whenever I voiced that I felt she didn't value me. Ultimately, I spent 10 years of my life foolishly dragging this friend along before we got in a tiny fight and, over text, she essentially said ""screw you, never talk to me again"".

Blessing in disguise because the second I was away from her, I truly realized all the manipulative crap she put me (and our other close friend) through. These type of people don't need to be in your life and toxic people only get worse if they don't actively try to change. You did the right thing not wasting your time on someone who doesn't truly value your presence."
azd874,"NTA. This is a situation where he doesn’t necessarily want you but doesn’t want anyone else to have you either. If a relationship is what you’re after, this isn’t where you’re going to find it. "
azdbay,"YTA. 

I suffer from debilitating migraines. They do not suddenly deprive me of basic human decency. You're being rude because you have an excuse to be rude and lazy about being polite. 

It's not a ""protocol"". It's called basic respect. You give her no respect and you expect her to coddle you and just take it? Nah man, treat people kindly if you want to be treated kindly. "
azdide,"NTA: If you make plans and then bail without saying anything then that’s just petty. 

Maybe talk to them about this? If you can’t meet in the middle then you should lose the friendship and find people who take you seriously. "
azdl28,"NTA

You don't like or have time for drama.

She was aggressive and didn't like that you rejected her. For her to get a friend to message that crap to you was petty and proved your point: that she's a drama queen. You should text back and say

""See what I mean? This is how she is AS A FRIEND and I don't want to take it further than that""


Be prepared for move drama though, lol"
azdrpq,YTA. Let her figure it out herself. 
azdt46,"NTA. If you're going to say something to a woman that is pretty obviously taken as offensive by most women, you best prepare to get insulted right back. "
azdz50,ESH. They suck for being on their phones. You suck for threatening them. 
aze0q0,YTA. It’s not up to you to decide what constitutes trauma. 
azeh7m,"NTA, he deserved it and he could have hurt you a lot more if you hadn’t protected yourself. "
azepsh,"YTA. She has the right to change her mind. After you are separated, she also has all the right to date anyone she wants, regardless of the reason she gave you for the breakup. Your reaction was uncalled for. "
azeqgb,"NAH you are most definitely in control of your future and your parents don’t have any real say in what you do, however I’m going to give your mom the benefit of the doubt that she’s really just trying to get you the best future no matter how misguided and misinformed she is. "
azer0q,"NTA. There is a time and place for jokes, and this wasn’t it. Just communicate to your roommate that you are really troubled by what they said, and that you hope you could discuss it with him and resolve it. "
azerzu,"YTA. It’s completely reasonable to ask your SO to stop flirting with others. 

Also, relationship requires communication and compromise. Just because it’s something you’ve been doing before you started dating doesn’t mean it’s something you should keep doing. "
azesfr,"NTA. When can we stop imposing our will on others? Death is hard for people.  We don’t truly prepare for it yet we want to pressure others to behave a certain way to make someone else comfortable.  

Your mom is hurting.  Your letter will not make a difference to your mom’s hurt. Your lack of letter simply gives anyone else something to bitch about while they are hurting.  Effective distraction and avoidance! 

Do your own thing.   A way of acknowledging your gramma’s life representative of the vibe you two shared.  Kindness and love to you.  "
azeugy,"YTA if you try to force sister into a gift sharing scheme she cannot afford.   

It's great to go in together on one larger gift *if you both agree that's what you want to do.*    

It's also OK to each buy separately according to your means, and if sister cannot afford an extravagant gift then she cannot afford an extravagant gift.   

"
azexrv,"You can definitely talk to them, but you need to keep in mind that they may not be able to reduce the noise to the level that is acceptable to you. Without knowing how you're approaching them or how they are going to respond this could be anywhere over the spectrum: NTA if you politely ask them and they completely ignore you (or even get angry with you), YTA if you completely blow up on them and don't consider the fact that it may be hard for them too."

azf19a,NTA You have my full sympathy. 
azf3ye,"NAH. Most high functioning autistic children do not attack other people just because they think it's ""funny"". Lower functioning ones don't tend to do it cause it's ""funny"" but because they can't control their outbursts. He may true and well be an asshole, especially if he is fully aware of what he is doing and uses his autism as an excuse to escape punishment, but you are at a school, do not refer to any students as an asshole."
azf6nw,"NTA, if its at her house then she should have to use her money or your child support money. Whether or not the child support money covers it doesn’t matter, shes a parent too"
azfg6o,"NTA - You probably felt like she was the only one who might get through to him (she won't, though). Also, this guy clearly does not give a damn about his child, move on for your daughter's sake. "
azfgup,NTA There are plenty of servers that have age limits to enter. It's not only the NSFW content there can be in the chat or anything because most of the time people don't want kids whining and destroying everything.

azflf0,"YTA. 

From your friend's perspective..he gets turned down by a girl he's interested in several times, rejection fucking sucks so he was probably already feeling shitty, and then he watched as his friend went right over and took the girl home that same night. Ouch. This is envibilty going to lead to thoughts like ""what does my friend have that I don't"", and other negative thoughts.

I will give you points for asking him before going for it, but personally I don't think you should go after girls your friend's are currently interested in, period."
azfpc2,"NTA. What you say you can't afford something, he's very much in the wrong for pressuring you to do it anyways. That said, it would probably be good to talk about it and let him know how you feel."
azfrx4,"NTA.

You told her how you're feeling emotionally neglected and she wants to cater to someone else's emotional needs."
azfs64,"NTA- But, what a delicate message to send! You don't want to offend her or hurt her feelings. She is being a bit gross though. I think I would manage the message by telling her one of your kinks and biggest turn ons is a freshly showered partner, still wet from the shower. If She is willing to indulge you, take her, whip off the towel and ravish her. Tell her how sexy she is all squeaky clean. Hopefully she will do this often to please you.  Good luck. "
azfsua,"NTA. You owe them nothing, and should only go to see them if it's a pleasant experience for you too. "

azfx54,"YTA. He wasn’t being rude at all, and your response of “I don’t want to talk about it” when he didn’t actually ask anything further than how are you is pretty rude. It sounds like you said it in a really snappy tone too. 

I’m not saying you can’t tell people that you don’t want to talk about your week because it wasn’t great. But it’s a family event, people are going to ask the same questions, and snapping at someone for no reason is rude "
azfxsr,NTA it's just rude the bring dogs into some else's house if they're not house trained. Also she should be cleaning up after them.
azfyn0,"NTA, you did something only because this was destroying her entire life, and yours along with it. I mean who can’t put down a 3DS long enough to buy groceries for Christ’s sake "
azg0tp,"NAH. But please read this... 

As a guy who lost his parents in his 20s, and who now has kids of his own, I'm asking - maybe even begging - you to see him and spend time with him. I know it hurts to see him like this; I imagine it's painful for him to be seen like this.

Aging, weakness, and death are a bitch. But spending your life low-key hating yourself for not seeing him is an even bigger one. The one thing I implore you not to do is give the impression that he was only worth something to you when he was strong and healthy. Show him that he helped raise someone who faces adversity. Someone who loves even when it's painful. It's possibly the best thing he can have as he leaves this Earth. "
azgcur,"YTA. Tattling isn’t a good trait to have, it never really ends well. If you wanna follow the rules exactly that’s your thing, but don’t force others by snitching. "
azgh12,NTA. Sometimes you can’t help people who won’t help themselves. And sometimes you just need to put your own life first. Just tell her what’s on your mind and hopefully it gets through to her that she needs to get out of that situation for her own sake and the sake of her kids.

azh2pr,"NTA. Honestly, the part about the fantasy is where your ex boyfriend is a complete and utter asshole. You tried twice to see the fantasy out and you weren't comfortable either time. He seriously has issues if he kept on bringing it up week after week.

You weren't wrong in the Tinder thing (since you stated you were done), but he's also not in the wrong for downloading it since you stated the relationship was over. I really think its best if you guys stop seeing each other. This was not a healthy relationship from the sounds of it."
azhlfn,"YTA.

>my best friend at the time stopped wanting to hang out with him because she didn’t feel like it and he kept asking me what was wrong with her and this that etc. Me and him started FaceTiming more and getting deeper conversations and sooner or later I knew I was in love with this kid

>...I finally told him how I felt about him right before they broke up 

The relationship was fading, but you way too involved with your friend's boyfriend and told him you had feelings for him.  

>I tried explaining to her that I can’t control how I feel and that it honestly wasn’t my fault for originally just wanting to be a good friend and be there for him when she wasn’t because she “just didn’t feel like hanging out with him.”

You can't control how you feel, but you can control your actions.  And I don't think the facetiming was you feeling bad for him, I think you already had feelings brewing.

>It still hurts me that she couldn’t be understanding

You're the one who fucked up.

You were ~16 when this happened and everyone makes dumb decisions when they are that age.  Dumb teenage mistakes don't define who you grow up to be. But you have to own your mistakes, not make excuses for them.

Lots of volunteer work is lovely but if they're neglecting their own household in order to help others, that's wrong on a lot of levels. You already do several times more work than I'd expect out of any grown adult, college student or not. 

You need to tell them to cut down their volunteer hours and help you out in the household, especially if your siblings are going to leave soon and the entire burden will be dumped on you. Sounds to me like your typical day is 14 hours of work, 5 days a week, plus more on weekends - basically two full time jobs combined. And that is *with* your siblings.

It's actively harmful to your grades (how can you set up study groups or go to tutoring sessions or office hours under this kind of schedule?), your social life and your mental health.

The grocery bills I'm kind of iffy on, you do go to a nice school and live in their household, so I understand that they want you to pitch in a little more money since I bet that school is expensive. I don't think that's really their worst transgression here.

I do think that it would be far less of a burden for you to take on the grocery bills if you just took more hours on your part time work and spent less time slaving away at home for their benefit and no pay.

I think you need to find a time when you're all calm and rational to discuss this, and ask them to take on less obligations/volunteer work so they can keep their household in order with you. 

You're not a domestic servant, nor are you being paid, so doing twenty to thirty extra hours of chores a week is a big problem. Especially if your siblings who normally share the burden are leaving for college soon. Mention that you're happy to take on the groceries but you need to take on some more hours in part-time work because of it, and you will not have time to do so many chores. Tell them about your days, and mention that your current schedule is very long, stressful, and backbreaking and is a lot of the cause of your resentment and anxiety. Hopefully they'll listen and be amenable to reason.

Personally, I'd split up the current chores into three groups, take on one set voluntarily, have the parents do the other two, and if they yell at you to do some the other two, demand pay for it."
azim2p,"NTA - sometimes people grow apart and recognizing that doesn’t make you an asshole. 

As we get older our priorities shift several times. It does sound like she was a flake friend for awhile but again. I don’t think this makes you an asshole."
azip33,NTA - Anywhere from 15%-20% reasonable.
aziw55,"NTA. If the other person is usually in the call with you, just bring them in the call with you."
azixt2,"It is pretty clear she has broken the code of D&D group. Don't be an asshole. If you guys play drunk d&d that's all good but in general it sounds like everyone didn't appreciate what she was doing. Although yeah you could call her, I feel like it would be pointless since she clearly isn't taking responsibility for her own mistakes. I would respectfully tell her you would like to discontinue her from the group or give her one last chance with serious and firm stipulations."
azj63x,NTA. She sounds “fun”. You should end any relationship you don’t want to be a part of regardless of reasoning.

This.

azjcdc,"NAH. As long as he's keeping his daughter close by, I doubt it's even registering with her because she's too young to really view it sexually. I mean, women do this all the time--most moms bring their young sons into women's bathrooms and neither the mom nor the boy thinks anything of it. My mom/grandma brought me into the women's bathroom with them all the time when I was little and I never thought anything of it, I just thought public bathrooms were gross in general (still do).

Edit: Re-read the post and changed my decision from YTA to NAH."
azjo5z,"YTA.  Let it go.  If he didn’t hear it, he didn’t hear it.  You must be young - I’ve seen enough terrible fights in bars, to know smart folk don’t start fights unnecessarily..."
azjohf,"NTA.  You didn't misinterpret her.  Her text suggested a clean start without the religous stuff.  She's gaslighting you into thinking that you should have know she would try to pressure you into converting.  You made it clear that you didn't share her beliefs at the start of your relationship, and she is being disrespectful in thinking that doesn't matter."
azjooq,"NTA, it's your house and you can tell her what to do with your furniture.  The dogs don't have to sit on the furniture. There's a floor they can sit on."
azjp00,"NAH - he does this professionally and botched his estimate. 

I work as a coordinator for several installers in my area and if they fuck up a bid they’re liable for the difference. It sucks for him but it won’t sink his company and hopefully he will be more diligent next time. "
azjrip,"NAH except airlines for putting people in these situations. You should be able to sleep and he should have enough legroom, but the airline made you pick one."
azjt52,"NTA  you are both pretty young,it was consensual. She might be and her friends are. You will never know what she told her friends and you will never know what her friends added to the story she told them. "

A slow cooker might be a better option for him."
azjw7a,"You can hardly blame a parent for defending their kid. When she learnt that she was wrong, she apologised and returned the money (and presumably also punished the kid).

azk5ts,"YTA 

Usually if someone is doing you a favor and lending you something, you don’t take it upon yourself to do anything to that their product. You return as is. He has his reasons and you shouldn’t have just taken it off because “it bothered me”. 

Buy your own TV and you can take off all the plastics that you want. "
azk7wl," NTA-if he's not working he needs to clean more than he did before. You shouldn't be leaving messes, but he should definitely be taking on extra responsibility."
azk98c,"YTA the way you talk about your wife is disgusting! She isn’t a lower class human being or something like that. There are many different reasons for having mental illnesses and if people call their partners pathetic for having one, it will lead to even more persons who will be too afraid to talk about it. You sound like a terrible husband."
azkcro,"NAH. 

You dont want a long distance relationship and she wants to go in the marines. Each their own. 

Your paths will split, nothing to do against that. "
azkgau,"NTA. You shouldn't have to wait for her addiction all the time. Moreover, she shouldn't smoke in the car with non-smokers present.

That said, you're an adult now and the best solution is probably to simply not to do this kind of stuff together with your mother anymore until she gives up smoking or using nicotine gum instead."
azkjng,"NAH. I don’t tip them either. Never have, never will. I tip waitresses and servers, but I’m not going to tip someone for just pushing buttons on a computer and pouring me a drink. That’s ridiculous. 

Tip culture itself is just fucking stupid. I would gladly pay an extra dollar or two if restaurants just raised their prices a little so they could afford to pay their employees themselves instead of forcing customers to determine their employees’ worth for them. "
azkk60,"NAH. This is really small potatoes, bro. Relax. "
azkkhz,"YWBTA. 

Two wrongs don't make a right, asshole. "
azkmkq,"NTA - she can’t have her cake and eat it too. She has to make a choice, you or this guy. You don’t go after your friends exes even if it is just as a prom date. "

azkq05,"NTA, but this is above Reddit's paygrade. You absolutely need to speak to a therapist."
azkt4l,"NTA

And never let another family member claim your son. That’s tax fraud. You and your husband are raising him, so you two are the ones entitled to tax benefits.

What your dad asked was inappropriate."
azkzlo,NTA they are complaining about free food and a really thoughtful gesture?
azl1xh,"NAH.  They have no obligation to talk to you, but it would be nice of them to do so.  It can be difficult to be accepted into new situations such as the one you are describing.  Although you are trying to include yourself and make friends they do not have to accept you, and you should not automatically expect them to.  You should continue to talk and make friends with whoever you can, but maybe that particular group isn't for you."
azl980,"INFO - 40lbs is a huge amount to gain in just over 2 months. I would be concerned that something is wrong - either physically or emotionally. If you bring it up because you care about her and want to help her than NTA, if you’re mean about it and only care about how she looks and not how she’s doing than YTA. "
azlar2,NTA Best of luck with your new asshole neighbors. 
azlefi,NTA. She can be a big girl and open doors for herself.
azleyx,NTA. And legally he’s on the hook for the rent. 
azlo3l,YTA. You could have just said no. 
azlu7p,NTA tell him to get a therapist/someone who can provide real help. There are suicide hotlines that he can talk to and get recommendations for doctors to visit that can help him.
azlwq2,"NTA. You're right about it being rude that she changed plans without warning. As for the abusive relationship part, you're the therapist, I don't think anyone is better suited than you to get her out of it."
azlyoy,NTA. People shouldn't be having children if they can't afford it. I hate hearing about how many children only get meals given at school. 
azlzk2,YTA. This girl isn’t a “conquest.” 
azm2of,"NTA, completely normal to go out do some things with the kids. If he really wanted to he could've gone as well so you aren't doing anything wrong."
azm6hc,"NTA

She sucks for leading you on as a friend when she had no intention of having any sort of relationship with you—friend or otherwise.

For real though, this seems like a dispute that you can just “let go”. You shouldn’t have talked to this girl ever again after she said she didn’t care about you. I would’ve stopped responding there."
azm801,"NTA. Don't let her meet your parents if either you or she or her feel uncomfortable with that. They are not entitled to meet her, and should be giving the two of you the time you need. The fact that they are pressuring you is a bad sign in itself."
azm8kx,"NAH. He required attention from a medical professional, which it seems from your description was already arranged by others, so there was no need for your help. Moreover, being in a panic attack yourself you can't be expected to arrange help."

But why did you reserve disabled seats to begin with if you and your GF aren’t disabled? Also, you forced someone that was disabled to move just because you wanted their seats. Even though you may have reserved them, you shouldn’t have done that. That’s the part that makes you an asshole. "

You’re over reacting and being unreasonable to expect everyone to remember your food orders, but this circumstance sounds like an easy enough order to just get it right considering it was through texts she can pull up and at subway they literally make the food as you’re telling them what you want. She also should have owned her mistake instead of turning the blame on you. "
azmw3s,"NAH so long as you’re extremely clear in your communication what you will and won’t be paying for so people can plan accordingly.

azp2j1,"ESH. Her for ghosting you again, and you for saying she ""led you on"" because she did not. She never told you that she wants to date you. It's ok to be disappointed but you can do that without trying to make a victim out of yourself and villain out of her. Besides, ""look what you said to me here!"" isn't going to make her suddenly WANT to talk to you. Relationships aren't owed, and affection cannot be demanded. She isn't that into you as a romantic interest. Accept it and move on. Either be a distant friend or don't."

You're not an asshole for being upset, especially given how hypocritical they are being. However, their efforts in getting someone to go with you is more likely out of concern than anything else. You said your parents are supportive so I doubt they withheld financial help with malicious intent. It all sounds like some miscommunication about how they felt about the trip in its entirety, and then again when it became clear you'd be traveling solo.

You're not selfish or being a brat at all, it's a frustrating situation. Know that their recent efforts in helping pay for your cousin is likely out of love for you."

azpg6b,"NAH - it’s not abnormal to adjust conversational patterns depending on the partner. 

Besides it’s coming from a place of kindness and acceptance and if it makes her day better that’s all that matters. 

You aren’t doing anything deceptive or shitty just trying to be there for someone who obviously needed someone. 

You didn’t do it because she’s trans you did it because it’s what made her comfortable enough to open up to you. "
azpnva,"NAH. This is a sucky situation for all involved. You're obviously not obligated to drive him around, and it doesn't sound like he believes he's entitled to that. I don't know what the solution would be, but you're not an asshole for not wanting him in your car. "
azpo3d,"No you're not.

He's 13. If he needs a racket a cheep one will do. A 13 year old touching something worth 300$ makes me nervous under the best conditions."

You gave him plenty of polite opportunities to back down and not act like a bizarro idiot and he didn't take them. If he continues like this with anywhere near as much vigor you may need to cut him as a friend entirely.
azqfb0,"NTA

You don't need toxic and uncaring people in your life. 

Don't do something you don't want to do just to please others or because others are making you feel guilty. Look out for yourself and take care of your needs.

However, if you can attend the wedding for little cost to yourself, it might be worth making the effort just for your own sake in case you decide you want to have some chance at a relationship later. If you want to burn the bridge that's your right though. Sounds like you feel it has already been burned maybe so you don't really need to worry about that and you can just skip out."
azqfc1,"NAH. If he is your mate, he probably just thought you were being a good friend as there was no mention of compensation. It would have been nice of him to compensate you but not expected. Maybe if you said ""sure but can you pay for gas?"" Then you would be justified. I don't think either of you are assholes. He wasn't required to pay for gas and you only think a bit less of him as a person. No real harm done. "
azqis6,"What the fuck? Why is she in your bed and not on the couch herself? Stick up for yourself, damn it. You aren't in a relationship anymore and she has no say on where you sleep, let alone whether you can talk to other people. "

That's not what's happening here. "

azrb3l,YTA.  Jokingly saying that you're going to send someone a box of gummy dicks isn't an insult in any way I can possibly think of?  I don't see how it could be construed as hurtful.  
azreqp,"NAH. He can offer gifts, you can politely refuse them. It's kinda weird though and may be his way of hitting on you. All the more reason to refuse."
azrfvj,"NTA, but keep in mind you may lose a friend over this. And if you don't lose a friend, he will lose something."
azriiw,"NTA, you helped her out. theres not much else to say. she got upset which i understand but then she went overboard by saying you made her depressed?? anyway, you have nothing to worry about. you seem like a really caring person"
azroru,"YTA. Your mom somehow made you dislike your sister in law? And your boyfriend is making you better? You need to take some responsibility for your own life and decisions, good and bad.  "
azrqkx,"Going against the grain here, NAH. You made a mistake, you apologized for it. It happens. No one is perfect and you didn't say that in malice. It was a knee-jerk reaction, don't beat yourself up. Everyone on here as fucked up before and them calling you an asshole even though you blatantly said ""I immediately feel terrible and try to apologize to her but she runs inside crying."" IMO are guilt tripping you for no reason. "
azrqo9,"NTA - Everyone deserves privacy in their relationship. Some people air everything to the world, and if both people are okay with it, that's fine. She should respect that you'd like to keep your private life private, and posting it anyway would be a violation of your trust. You can't live authentically if you're constantly afraid that anything you do could be published to the world. "
azrvpo,"I wonder if OP ever considered how her mother or sister deal with grief. Perhaps this new puppy helps them, those who actually live in the house. Whereas OP seems to live elsewhere while studying and only home for holidays?"
azry23,"YTA.

Because what you basically just did was ask your mother to choose between her children.

Your sister also sucks, by the way.

Perhaps you could instead suggest that your mother insist that your sister pay for a regular cleaner, if she's unwilling to clean her own messes.

Your sister is a slob, it is what it is, but asking your mother to *reject her child* is an asshole move."
azrypj,"YTA I dont expect to get a lot of upvotes for it, but he was trying to be considerate for your feelings. Your response was just childish."

azskwh,NTA if you can’t accommodate him on short notice then he should understand.  
azslys,"Holyyyyyy shit I just changed my mind. YTA. 

Get ready for a dose of reality. Being pregnant is crazy hard. Her hormones go through so much. There’s going to be at least 6-8weeks after the baby is born that she physically cannot have sex, and that’s assuming no medical complications, post partum depression, etc. 

It sounds like you don’t love your girlfriend, just yourself and sex. "
azsmbi,YTA. Why do you even ask.

azt2bg,"NAH at all, this can be very hard on people and many family members have such thoughts. You might want to look into finding a support group of people in similar situations to be able to speak your mind (which you obviously can't do with family in this case)."
azt3x0,"NAH 

Dude it’s normal to feel insecure about these things. You’re out of your normal pattern and you haven’t had sex in a while so you’re missing the closeness. 

The fact that you freely admit you were unjustly crotchety with her tells me you’re certainly not an asshole here. 

Just take note of your own words and don’t take it out on her. If it’s affecting you, talk to her about it. 

You just need some lovin man, once you both reconnect this will seem silly in hindsight. "
azt48i,"YTA. They may have been on a break, or just before/after their shift. Not grounds to complain."
azt6nd,"YTA

I was going to say ESH since you both cheated, but at least your GF confessed, whereas you just kept that shit on the downlow. If you *really* felt that way about cheating, you would have confessed to your GF after the overseas holiday and broken up with her yourself. It's because SHE did it to YOU not the actual act of cheating being the main reason you broke up with her, which is why you're the asshole. "

aztcxv,"NAH- on one condition.
Once you ""fix"" or help the person, do you leave to find someone else? If so, then yes you are the asshole. If not then you are not an asshole. It's only natural to want to help others, especially if they are going through things like you. Being able to relate to those who have the same mental of physical problems can help to develop a relationship. Plus if it helps your mental health, then go for it, so long as you don't make the other person's life worse to make yours better. But there are other ways to help and people who need help that you are not in a relationship with. There are subreddits that are devoted to helping others, so I would try those too."
aztdu2,NTA. You get to deal with the breakup any way you want so long as you're not harming anyone. 
azte7h,"NTA. There is no rule that says you have to live close to your family, and your family should be supportive of your living situation. "
aztedq,"YTA. Scalding coffee can cause serious burns and injuries. A beer can probably won't.

I don't think you were in the wrong to react defensively. I do think you were in the wrong to escalate it with coffee."
aztfnd,She shit talked him to his new girlfriend. She’s definitely TA in that specific situation. 
aztgf2,ESH. She sucks for planning to sell a dog that doesn’t really belong to her and you suck for throwing the things you’ve done to help her in her face to gain leverage in an argument. 
azthmb,NTA.   He sounds like he's being too difficult if he's rejecting cheap places and won't give you an idea he likes.  Also he controls what he orders so he could order extra cheap anywhere and still be social and supportive. 
aztj0h,"NTA - Bills don’t work like how she’s expecting them to work. For electricity, things like the fridge still need to run. And for gas, you still have to keep the apartment at a certain temp. If she expected not to pay because she doesn’t live there most of the week, then she should’ve communicated it with you and asked earlier"
aztltr,"ESH - The lady for extremely overreact to the situation, your GF for escalating the problem, and you for advocating for your GF to just take the abuse.

The correct answer would just be to talk to the management and have the belligerent lady removed."
aztnyp,"NTA, but definitely get back into that routine as much as is possible for you. It likely means more to him than you will ever know. "
aztrqn,"NTA, and it sounds like your parents are enabling his toxic behavior, based on the stories you've told.   

He's 30, he shouldn't be jumping to violence immediately like some school yard bully. "
aztuu8,[deleted]
aztzsl,NTA. I always tell the truth to employers about potential workers. My professional reputation is on the line when asked so...
azu5wc,"NTA. Your friend’s roommates are douche bags though. You were right to pay the $10 because it’s a trivial amount of money. If I’m you, I’m making comments about this for life though. Every time I see them I’m asking if there’s a charge to hang out. If you’re at their house to watch a game, I’m inquiring about a cover charge, etc. Its truly insane to ask someone for $10 for having slept on a couch for two nights. "
azu649,"NTA, but let him know why you can’t extend the invitation. It’s the honest thing to do, the true friend thing to do—and tbh, it sounds like he might spin out with his own ideas if you don’t communicate this clearly. "
azu690,"NAH, your kids said their goodbyes already and didn't want to attend, but it is understandable that their grandmother would be upset they aren't there. "
azu7pc,"NTA. 

Probably better to frame it the way you did in your final paragraph rather than wanting to be sexually active on vacation, but you aren't TA here. 

"
azu877,"NTA. He stated how things would play out based on M's decision, and you simply followed through. "
azu8fs,"YTA. 

>I’m getting to the point where I want to just kick her out and tell her to find a somewhere else to live

Because she’s not Muslim? Don’t move in with someone you have no intention of staying with, you asshole. "
azuaku,"NTA for breaking up, but YTA for kissing the other girl. 

If you were unhappy, you should have talked about it rather than become resentful. You know what you did?  Confirm all her worst fears and signal her worry was valid, which is not really helpful to her in the long-run. If you really had her best interests at heart, you wouldn't have gone and done exactly what she was afraid you would do. "
azuf5a,"NTA - Your mom is working two jobs and you're letting your friend break shit she has to fix/pay for? You're almost the asshole.

Sorry to hear your friend has had it rough but make it clear he can either stop being a disrespectful prick or stop coming over."
azug9z,"NTA. A 2 year old should not be left unattended, especially with a dog. "
azugtr,"NTA.

This is a really hard situation, and I understand you feeling like you’ve done something terrible, but it was unfair to you guys and the dog to keep things going. Be strong OP, you’ll get through the grief"
azukeg,NAH - but I’d still avoid this altogether just to fade the almost inevitable drama from this scenario. 
azukri,"NTA

The table was clearly already yours, and you had your food in hand. Not sure why the server was trying to get you reseated, or why they were trying to seat someone at a table that already had food on it. 

The sense of entitlement of older people drives me nuts sometimes. Like because they’re older you should just give them whatever they want. Unreal. "
azuktv,"NTA

because he ruins the night then it was all a waste of money "
azumtb,NTA - Tell the landlord immediately. That is unacceptable. 
azun13,"3 Paragraphs about stealing someones bucket.

>This man go really fucking angry for no reason,

Also

>kicked his hard hat off

r/osha

Finally, YTA for taking someone else's equipment but I'm laughing at this whole story. Dude could you have gotten a lock to lock the handles together? Or put them in a locker or something. Contractors steal shit all the time, you knew this.
"
azurf3,NAH. You told her to do whatever she wanted and she did. Turns out you aren't as big of a fan as you thought. As long as you approach it politely I don't think this is an asshole thing to do at all. 
azuyfy,NTA- you have the right to change your mind and she shouldn’t be bitchy about it. 
azuz6g,"INFO. How old are you?

From current info... YTA. You live with your parents. You should do the dishes, if they ask you to. Sounds like she only brought up your grades because you did. And it sounds like you brought them up just to get out of doing the dishes. 

She tried to check on you, see what was up, and you snapped at her. All because you want to spend more time with her? 

YTA man. "
azv7n7,"NAH

This is above your pay grade, dude. Therapists are meant to be the ones dealing with this. Next time he brings something up, I'd recommend telling him that you can only do so much, and that to really improve his life he's going to have to see a professional. You aren't trained in dealing with mental illness, it's not your job, don't feel bad. You can be there for someone just by empathizing with them.

Of course, don't fault him. He has an illness he doesn't know how to cope with. I've been there. He needs therapy and medication. "
azvcgu,"NAH - You're in a really tough spot. Your mom has an addiction and Bertha is enabling that. Before asking Bertha to not visit anymore, would it be possible to plan her visits so you will be there to say no to your mom if she asks for alcohol? This would of course make you the bad guy, but it's just another potential alternative"
azvf10,NTA. Your friend sucks. I would never talk to her again.  She is nutty.
azvf7o,"NTA, your mother seems to lack perspective and is putting his ‘reformation sotry’ above your mental health and well-being"
azvgyk,"NAH - Unless your classmates know you have Tourettes and are still being sort of jerks, then they might be assholes. You are not being an asshole. Your tics aren't that bad and you can't help having them at some point. I don't think you need to negatively impact you're learning for something that little. 

That said, I am unreasonably annoyed by humming, so I get where your classmates are coming from, but if I knew it was a tic I would, you know, get over myself. To be clear though, you do not need to tell other people your medical issues unless you feel like it. Just ignore them."
azvhig,"YTA. Work Christmas parties are pretty common for people to bring their SO to. Going with her is showing that you support her. I think you should have gone for that reason. Sounds like you're in college which is when you just have to do some things you don't want to, like that. It's just a game and will be there everyday for you to play when you have time. I play smash too it's awesome. Still should have gone. "
azvhil,"NAH. It's your apartment, and it's not like you're drumming loudly or something. You're allowed to take a shower when you want. If it's making you feel guilty, you could just ask your neighbors if it bothers them."
azvhsx,"YTA. I don't want to rant, but due to laws of momentum, a closing door takes about twice as much force to open as a shut door. Obviously, a door that's being held open is easier than either one. Because of this, society has an unwrittten social contract that says you should hold the door for people if they're close enough that the door won't fully close by the time they get to it. It's the same as zipper merging, or walking past people on the right side. When everyone does it, everyone wins. That woman you hit in the face expected you to hold the door because she holds it for others, and she deserves the same common courtesy. You don't even have to do the doorman thing; just walk through the door and then reach back and press it with your palm for a second. It's so easy."
azw0tq,Nah - but do it
azw371,"NAH - it's weird that you're treating ""I love you"" as a weapon and not an expression of how she was feeling. You were honest, she was honest, and it didn't work out."
azw66t,In case any of you wanted to know how loud he is here is this:  https://youtu.be/-Vd04A3HTo0
azw75g,"YTA. You’re literally stringing this guy along for your own benefit. 

“Because I like validation”

“I’m not sure why I’m with him”

How awful. Do him a favour and break up with him so he can find someone who treats him the way he deserves."
azw7cj,"NTA, but come on, how old are you guys?"
azw7ps,NTA - this isn’t a big ask. It’s essentially you asking that he shows more respect for you by not liking porn on a public forum. 
azw9pd,"YTA. You must look pregnant, no matter how much you think you don’t. They’re only trying to be kind. I’ve been pregnant on public transportation before (as I imagine these other women have) and it’s hard to stand without falling. A simple “no thanks, I’m not pregnant” would be enough to get a person off your back without being rude, just watch your tone. Try to remember that each individual isn’t trying to hurt you, they’re genuinely trying to help you."
azwb3i,"NTA but your boyfriend is. If he's known for lying and pushing boundaries, unfollowing this girl will do nothing. 

&#x200B;

I've been down this road and nothing good comes of it."
azwczo,"ESH

Your roommate should have helped you clean originally, but you told him YOU would do it and you didn't. You didn't even touch the kitchen and you didn't finish the job in the bathroom. Your female suite-mates use both facilities as well and so it was real lame for them to say that you had to do it since you were there first. Realistically y'all both contributed to the mess that's there now so it's EVERYONE'S responsibility.

As for him saying that they reported you because they saw your used razors? I doubt that very seriously. I think they reported you because you had now several weeks worth of grime in the kitchen (honestly this is gross af), and weeks worth of trash in the can in the bathroom since you said you didn't take it out.

Really, you should try and clean as you go so there's not one giant mess or delegate weekly tasks so that it doesn't turn into a game of he-said she-said.

&#x200B;"
azwe3u,"Time that college apps are due? Yes, but not the age just yet. I'll be doing that next year. However, your advice seems sound, I'll see what I can do. Thank you!"
azwhvr,NTA. kinda creepy that a family member would base their love on your level of attractiveness
azwir7,NTA. I would be beyond hurt if my best friends weren't there for me during the illness and after the death of a parent. I'm sorry about your loss.
azwmle,"YTA. I'm sure you feel really big mentally torturing your minor brother for not siding with you over his mother when he was 12. 

To be honest he's probably better off without your influence in his life."
azwmze,NTA. This is a weird situation and one I think you’re better off removing yourself from. Ghost the hell out of this guy. 
azwplk,"NTA.  Gun safety is a real issue and everyone should be aware of this.  Kyle was not at his home and did not have permission to take guns to the house he and Liz were watching. He should be more careful because he could have gotten into soooo much trouble there. It could have been so bad. Liz should acknowledge this and realize that he was in the wrong and should be more careful about his decisions and all around gun safety. That boy just ain't right lol. 

In your paragraph about her BF on camera with the gun you used his real name FYI. "
azwun2,"NAH.  You were celebrated for being a valuable part of the school community.  Even if you were being paid through the school, you clearly connected with the students well enough to be appreciated.  You didn't manipulate anyone into anything by taking your mom up on her offer."
azwv6p,"I learnt English from forums, YouTube and movies and Omegle! But when it comes to “fancier” vocabularies I honestly don’t know much of them. Like I had to google “colloquial” 🙈 

It’s much easier if you learn the language by consuming media of something you’re really interested, preferably that it doesn’t have much resources in English so you’re sort of forced to use / learn the foreign language "
azwvr0,"Yta.

I think you are being very dramatic and need to talk to your wife about being jealous of a dog. Thank goodness you don't have kids."
azwxi7,"NAH.  What she's going through sounds incredibly frustrating, painful, and discouraging, so there's no way I'm going to call her an asshole here.

I wouldn't call you an asshole either, though.  Sometimes, relationships just don't work out, and it sounds like you have a few incompatibilities here."
azwz8o,"NTA. You’re not wrong for feeling this way - but if this is a position you really want, I don’t think skipping work and not helping during the trial is going to make you look very good. "
azx2kd,"YTA, possibly.

I'm not clear on if you just drifted apart because he was no longer coming to family gatherings or if you just cut him out of your life completely. He converted to a different religion, it happens, it's his right to do so. If you stopped talking to him because of it that's a crappy thing to do."
azx6yr,"YTA.  She's right--you shouldn't have planned a public proposal without talking to her first.  Really, you shouldn't propose to someone at all without talking about it first.

Would you have felt better if she said no in front of everyone?"
azx78a,"YTA.  I was torn until this:

~~""hey lily, hope all's alright with you. I noticed you went [somewhere she put on her insta story], hope you had a good time. Love you, kiss""~~

~~and~~ 

>She didn't really acknowledge me either. I feel like she made me look like an idiot. I honestly don't really want to hear any explanation

~~Not only is that text way too forward for a friend who just broke up with someone,~~ You made it all about you.  How does her not answering your texts for a few days (which is very reasonable when it sounds like she's having a hard time) make *you* look like an idiot?

EDIT: The text part's not a huge deal as it seems like more of a translation error than anything, but I stand by this being an asshole-ish overreaction to the situation."
azxay6,">I told her if it came to it I would choose the video games over her not because they are more important but because she resorted to an ultimatum for something is consider silly and if she is going to do that what is she capable of demanding in a marriage setting?

Preach. 

NTA. "
azxdmx,"ESH.

In general, extricate yourself from any relationship with people like this.

The reason why you want to do that is to avoid exactly what happened here - you fell into the trap of being like someone who is a terrible human, and justified it because he did it.  

GTFO of those situations."
azxg4a,"YTA because from the sounds of it, you're stringing this girl along. 

also, what's with all these posts about not being attracted to your partners lately? can y'all not have a single mature conversation with your partners?"
azxkx5,"ESH including your parents. She should not have shouted and made a scene because everyone is free to reject advances. Your parents for trying to control your marriage. And you for telling her it was because she was black, when in reality it is because she wasn’t Indian/of your culture. Sort of a big difference there. Also, you’re an idiot for going along with an outdated tradition that says you can only be with your own “race”."
azxpm2,"NTA

The free-loader is, though. Put your foot down with the boyfriend and list all the reasons you want him gone here. You signed up to live with him and just him. You don't want roommates or you would have stayed where you were. This is your place and it's too small for 3 people.

Buddy needs to GTFO."
azxs64,"> also past major crushes.

I stopped reading right here. NTA and this is the 3rd crush post I've commented it on in an hour.

Crushes don't give someone this false claim they feel like they have. You liked a person and didn't act on your feelings or got rejected if it's a past crush, that sucks, but that doesn't mean your friend can't try. 

**NTA**, your friend sucks"
azxtvl,"NTA.  When you receive the invite, just reply, ""Your first, second and third weddings were gorgeous!  I'm sorry I have to miss your fourth.  Best wishes and have fun!"""
azy0om,"NTA and seems like you dodged a bullet.

Weather can always impact plans, and he should figure that out."
azy0x8,"YTA, you should've donated it to a library or something. A Goodwill. There were many other options that weren't ""walk up to someone trying to advertise their first book ever and tell them you have so little interest that you're going out of your way to return it to them so you don't have to own it"".

I know it wasn't intentional, but you were still the asshole there."
azy5dx,"NTA. You're not ""causing fights"", you're communicating your wants and needs. He's TA for stringing you along. He's clearly not making you a priority, but for whatever asshole reason isn't just coming out and saying that he doesn't want to see you. "
azyaet,YTA get a gun safe
azybh8,"NTA.
 
>""I have a legitimate legal case given that it's not legal to keep siblings from communicating/seeing each other.""

I'm pretty sure that's not true anywhere. You might want to ask on r/legaladvice"
azyht4,[deleted]
azyhvk,"NTA 

No one likes getting interrupted, so your reaction was very civil, and his was very childish."
azyji6,"YTA - your innocent little ""glance"" is passive-aggressive and you know it.  you want a reaction from her and you get one.  let other people manage their own lives and health. "
azyk40,"NTA.

I think I’ll be going against the grain with this one but hey—

So you’ve already told your wife that you are stretched too thin and she didn’t seem to care let alone implemented any new things in her routine to help you.

You did something to explicitly against her wishes. You did. That’s terrible. But YOU have to do what’s right for you and your mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing otherwise you’ll crack and won’t be able to support your family anyway. You told her you couldn’t do it all. She didn’t pick up the slack. You did what you had to do to keep yourself from breaking.

THEN she’s cold and possessive. Which is understandable and reasonable. For some reason she didn’t want your mom coming to help.

THEN she brings up an argument the two of you had to a friend you were *both at lunch with*. It’s her friend. She needs support. But not appropriate time to bring it up.

Have you talked with her about postpartum depression? Maybe that’s a factor in her lack of motivation to help around the home?"
azyo03,"NTA.  Unless your lease has a clause about mandatory waiting periods for sex partners, tell the roommates to fuck off."
azyrgj,YTA for refusing to apologize. It takes a big man to admit when he's wrong - nice that you're electing to be teeny-tiny. 
azyvwo,"I'm gonna say NAH. Although you shouldnt have made a big deal about how busy you were at the time, yet make it sound like you would set the time aside for your cousin to do.

And I get you have social anxiety, but does that really prevent you from going out and doing anything with anyone new all the time? Coming from someone who doesnt deal with social anxiety, its hard for me to grasp "
azyy7y,NTA. Your only job as a bridesmaid is to show up sober in the dress and shoes she wants you in.
azz1y2,"NTA. He makes up lies about you, lashes out at you and your friends over nothing and still expects to be part of your friend group? Nah. "
azz46l,"YTA-

Is this a SHP? Learning a culturally native language is a huge advantage for children. It helps develop their brain, helps them learn third and fourth languages better, and gives them a strong sense of identity. It also doesn’t look bad on a resume, no matter the starting language.

Also, even if the *only* reason to teach your kids your native language would be so they could talk to your mother.... why is that so bad? A child will pick up the language just as fast as English, your mother will struggle to master English at her age, and she doesn’t seem to want to. She’s 100% correct that you’d be cutting her off from her grandkids. "
azz4js,NTA. lmao your brother is an idiot. 
azz58p,"NTA. When you turn 18 you become an adult and can attend the school of your choice. However, your parents may choose not to pay for it."
azz6g2,"ross, is that you?"
azz6n8,"NAH. I wouldn’t say that your friend is an asshole for ‘bragging’. Everyone treats new experiences differently, and sometimes people just love to talk about it. However, it can get annoying. You’re not an asshole for making it clear to your friend that he was annoying you. I guess one could say YTA because of your mean tone, but when you hold back too long, it can make you lash out. You would be the asshole if you don’t apologise."
azz7th,NAH - this is a crappy time for everyone. A bit of patience from everyone involved wouldn't go astray. 
azze1u,"YTA. yikes, Dude, one week is nothing and way too soon to be asking for that...unless I’m misunderstanding how long you’ve been seeing each other?  "
azzp5t,[deleted]
azzpve,"Umph, it seems NTA not only based on the title, but also on the body as well.

&#x200B;

Reporting such a theft is the good thing to do."
azzqcb,NTA. Your doctor was an inappropriate jackass. 
azzte4,"NTA - Didn't even read the text of your post, just the title. Good enough for me."
azzu8l,">I use Tinder frequently and I have in my bio ""No very dark skinned chicks"". 

Why are you here?  YTA obviously.  If you're not interested in darker skinned women, swipe left instead of wasting their time.  All you're doing by broadcasting that preference is making yourself look rude and racist."
azzunr,That just sounds like bisexuality with extra steps 
azzw2p,"YTA - Seriously? He wasn't being rude to you. He was addressing his care and concern for her. 

You sure made one hell of a first impression..."
b003jg,"ESH. Why are a brother and sister and you living together at age 30? It sounds like there's a lot more to this story, and maybe they were justified. You shouldn't have recorded them. Hard to say more without knowing more."
b00448,"NTA.  Be honest with the dude, dude, and you'll get the dudeliest outcome. He'll dudely understand. YTD (you're the dude)."
b004f8,"NTA.  There's a saying about how if all the people around you are acting crazy/abusive, that odds are the problem isn't all of those people. 

This all sounds very Cluster B-y to me, I think you're right. "
b005x6,"YTA. You should have used protection and if you didn't, that's on you, not her. You are responsible for your own sexual health because you cannot rely on people to tell the truth. "
b007dz,"NTA- you trust her not to cheat, but do you trust him to not force himself on her or cut a peephole in the shower? (I’m only partly joking) "
b00e7a,"YTA (YWBTA), yes. Please do not try to contact people who clearly do not want to see you anymore."
b00e84,"YTA. You just admitted to making very poor choices and that you've learned from them and matured. Isn't the ""raging driver"" telling you the same? Why must HE suffer for something that YOU caused?

Grow up, OP."
b00hj3,"YTA, address your phobia; like seriously see a mental health professional because this will affect your life negatively. 

Pregnancy and children is a normal part of life and the older you get the more people in your social circle will start having kids.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with not having children your self, or even avoiding events where there might be a lot of children present.  But its unrealistic to expect every close friend to remain childfree forever.

Edit: I will also point out that I dislike children, and avoid interacting with them when possible, but dropping a friendship entirely is going too far."
b00i65,NTA. Your work your credit. Unless they want to admit/reference you then they can take a hike
b00lnv,NTA. What year is this?
b00lyj,"NAH, your situation is very unfortunate and by the way you talk about her I feel like you know she is a good person deep down and you do care about her. Some medications can have very strong effects and it can be very taxing on the friends and family of the people on the medicine. That being said, nobody owes anything to anyone when it comes to relationships, if you are not happy with the relationship as it is and do not see it improving, then moving on may be whats best for you. "
b00os8,"ESH. Your brother is a homophobic asshole, you're trying to cockblock your brother and claiming some kind of moral high ground."
b00q36,"Ehhh... I'm going with NAH. Not to burst your bubble, but there have been a thousand fujifilm or polaroid wedding guest books with chalkboards (just Google image search it). Same with the other ideas you had, I'm sure. If possible, I would stay proud of how you came up with these ideas but take the desire to imitate them as the sincerest form of flattery - it's pretty cool that she loved what you did so much she wants to have her biggest day play out similarly."
b00snm,"NTA in both cases. Dating your best friend after ghosting you and shit is fucked up, both by her and your best friend (if he even is that after this)You never should have got back with her but i understand how strong emotions are compared to logic at times. She treated you badly and deserves what she got. You dodged a bullet. "
b00uyb,"What's with all the super biggots recently? Is marrying inside your own race really that important to people?

Anyways, NTA. I'd stay out of it though but do what you will."
b00ynn,"NTA, but 7 is a bit young for being alone in changing rooms. 13 is a bit old for needing his mommy."
b0154y,"NTA - I’m sorry that this happened to you. Your life was deeply affected and you were traumatized, and your dad is trying to minimize it. Not ok. "
b01624,"NTA

It's common not to tell anyone before 3-4 months in anyway.

And btw one year isn't very long to be trying. Based on her (lack of) maturity she isn't ready to be a parent - sulking in your room and punishing others with nasty attitude for being pregnant instead of being happy for them is a way to alienate people and I understand you wanting to avoid dealing with her especially when you are pregnant."
b0186q,"NTA sShe took your money, and really didn't pay you back.

This sounds like a common occurrence for her. IE she is a mooch."
b0190j,[deleted]
b01dbb,"NAH for not wanting her to contact him, but you would be an asshole if you told her she couldn’t."
b01dty,"NTA 

Who the fuck hides a kid and then brings them on the first date? Lmao"
b01gu8,"NTA. What kind of jackass makes a test like that? It sounds like you called her out for being shitty and she came up with a lame excuse for her behavior. Bye, Felicia that girl for good!"
b01nlk,"NTA.

I think it's understandable for you to feel this way. Do you think he will mind not being invited? Sounds like he doesn't enjoy this sort of thing much.

I think you need to be clear why you would prefer to go with your GFs as he may worry it's something else."
b01nyw,[deleted]
b01q3a,"NTA. If your son is harassing the cat, and the cat defends itself, your husband can't get mad at the cat like that. It's a difficult situation, but the cat doesn't know any better. Of course it's going to nip. That level of aggression with an animal is ridiculous."
b01v3t,NTA. I understand your situation. The smell of weed makes me extremely nauseous. Maybe call management one more time and really complain and let them know your going to get the police involved if they dont handle it. 
b01x7r,"NAH

You feel betrayed. You had trust in him and felt as though he broke that.  At the same time, drug addiction is not something that is easy to overcome. It takes hard work and relapses are always possible. Your dad probably feels as though he betrayed himself as well. Relapses can be hard for all parties involved. "
b01x8l,"ESH. Don’t expect your friendships to last long in a circle like that. If you all want to screw each other without putting a title on it then keep it simple and screw each other.

You’re not an asshole for thinking of an old girlfriend, especially when you’ve gotten into your first relationship since her. I’m not going to comment on the morality of it, because I can very well understand that it’s not your intent or your desire to get back together with her that’s bringing up the thoughts. 

Now, what’s reassuring is that you’re thinking of the good + the bad, so you’re not having a rose-coloured flash back on “what could have been”. It’s normal to think back to certain memories. 

What would make you the asshole is if you acted on these thoughts. If they fade away in a while, you’re good. But if they persist for way too long, and things with your current girlfriend are getting serious, you may want to take a step back.

Consider reevaluating if you’re truly over her, or if she left an emotional scar that you’re not able to heal from, and take an action accordingly. In the event of that, consult a therapist, or at least sort your feelings out, and don’t forget about your responsibility to your girlfriend (which does not always mean involving her in your emotional drama— but don’t be unfair to her). 

Reminiscing doesn’t hurt anybody but you, especially if it hampers your relationship from growing, or stops you from being completely invested in your relationship. So nobody but you can decide if at this stage, it’s anything “wrong”. 

But speaking realistically, I see no reason to hurt your girlfriend over this right now, by getting her involved. If you think it’ll pass, it’ll pass. Just let the thoughts come and go, try and focus your energy on your current relationship and your life otherwise. Avoid the temptation to contact your ex,

It’s. Never. Worth. It. "

To clarify, Fiancé owed a loan to Grandfather. Grandfather died and the manager of the will took out what was still owed from the loan out of parent’s share of inheritance.

And if I were you, I’d be annoyed that I’m expected to pay someone who had nothing to do with the original loan.

b0b7zd,NAH but this is something your teacher/coach should address. If he has something like Tourette syndrome he may very well not have full control. If there is a neurological basis for this behavior (which it sounds like there very well may be) then he might not even be able to respond to your request. I wouldn't tell him to be quiet--get an authority figure involved.

b0bc5j,">I faced a large amount of physical/sexual/emotional abuse from my biological parents, and H always supported me through my battles with mental disorders. 

You had a rough childhood and she was supportive.

>Then I was kicked out of my home and my relationship with H went into a downward spiral. I very rarely saw H because she was spending so much time with her new friends from college. I confronted H, and she apologized and claimed it was because of “school” and “work” taking up a large amount of her time so her schedule was always packed. 

“School” and “work” are valid reasons to be busy, and are good priorities to have. 

>I then met my significant other, who I will call D. H never cared for D and made this fact very clear, and she screamed and yelled at me after D picked me up and I slept at his house for our one-week anniversary. She told me I needed to let someone know before I went out with boys I “didn’t know very well” because “I could end up getting in a bad situation”. 

This is a protective friend

>I moved in with R after a month of dating and H refused to drive out to see me, even though it was only a 30-minute drive. 

Moving in after a month is super impulsive, and she was likely not supportive for that reason.

>She always had excuses saying that the “drive was too far” and that “I didn’t help pay for gas”. I told her that I would never put a monetary value on her friendship and she said that was not fair, because I wasn’t the one who had to spend money to hang out. At the time, I did not have my driver’s license or a job, so this really, really hurt. 

So you expect her to have money when you don’t. You know tuition is expensive, right?


>I called her a selfish bitch that cared about money more than her best friend, and she ignored this. I later apologized for my outburst. We started to talk again, but it was never quite the same because she was always hanging out with T. 

You went put an unfair burden on her and then got mad at her for it. I imagine it wouldn’t be the same. 


>I went through 5 pregnancy scares, and she NEVER ONCE was there to support me through these scary times, and I told her that she was not a good friend for not supporting me through my problems.

You are showing a tendency to be in the role of the needy one, and she is understandably pulling away. After the first scare you should have gotten some birth control, or better birth control. 


>Now, D has proposed to me and I am ecstatic. I already have it planned out, and picked a MOH dress to match H. You can imagine my shock when I was given a very confident NO. 

Because you always need attention, and she is expected to help when you have no money and no job. Okay. Seems fair to me. 


>When I asked why she informed me that she felt she could not live up to MY expectations and that she felt that I had “taken advantage” of her ever since we had finished high school, and that she did not feel comfortable committing to something this major when I have spent the past few years “bumming rides and cash off of her.” 

Your whole description so far is you needing her for your problems. 

>The only time I have EVER had her pay for me was when I was going through depression and I asked her to bring me food, and she only did this ONCE. Other than that, she has driven me around only a handful of times, so overall I would guess that she has only spent $50-60 on me. I brought this up to her and she LAUGHED and said I was “proving her point that I was only focusing on myself and my own problems.” 

Have you ever done anything for her? 

>I have not spoken to her since. My fiancé tells me that she is being a huge bitch and a terrible friend, but when I asked one of our mutual friends they agreed with H. Am I being the asshole???

I'm on disability, so I have a general idea of the process it takes to get approved and maintain disabled status with the Social Security Administration (I actually just went through my annual 3-year disability review to ensure that I was still disabled).   Trust me when I say that these people are so far up a disabled person's ass that they can no longer remember when they last saw the sun.


#1, your step cousin can have her own little house (Under SSA guidelines, disabled people are allowed to have ONE house and ONE car in their name at any given point in time; It's just that most of us can't afford to do that)

#2, She can have a full-time job so long as it does not go over a predetermined amount of allowed hours.  

#3 ""hasn't been sick for over 2 years"" - The illnesses that one typically gets disability for tend to have periods of flare and remission.  Just because she hasn't had a flare in 2 years does NOT mean that she can't get one at whatever moment."

You're roommates, not obligatory friends.  Part of the college experience is learning how to live with someone you don't necessarily get along with.

You two need to communicate and compromise.

She's voiced that she's sensitive to your perfume.  Consider changing fragrances, or spraying it outside so you don't trigger her allergies.  Find something that works.

Talking on the phone late at night while someone is trying to fall asleep, especially after her being woken up due to a fire alarm, is quite inconsiderate of you.  You could go outside to talk, talk via instant messages, or find another solution that doesn't disturb your roommate.  You're the one keeping a long-distance relationship, so you're the one that needs to find an appropriate solution.

Her going on social media and complaining about you is immature in and of itself.

While she was trying to build up the confidence to take it, she tried to convince herself she didn't need to, (""I'm sure I'll get my period today."")

But, she was still scared.  She texted you because she knew you weren't gonna be able to sit on this for long, maybe hoping you'd make her feel safe enough to take the test.  Maybe she was hoping for ""I'm sure it'll be fine. The only way to know is to take it and see.""

Instead she got a rant about how she was being selfish (which she probably was, but not without merit. She was scared.)  In the end, instead of comforting her, you chewed her out.

I think you had valid reason to be upset, but you completely failed to consider what she was going through, and that would make YTA.

While it isn’t right to get snappy at your mother for asking for help, the driver should be able to navigate by themselves without relying on the passenger.

Assuming your a teenager, yeah the driver definitely shouldn’t be relying on you for advice."
b0lbt6,"YTA but only in the context that you are trying to dictate how your girlfriend manages her own individual finances.

You are coming from a loving and practical standpoint, so I don’t think you are truly an asshole. And you are free to offer advice and assistance as you see fit. However, and this is where the asshole bit comes into play, ultimately you cannot control her life and what she does with her money. She is an adult and presumably has the capacity to make her own financial decisions (regardless of whether they are right or wrong in your eyes).

For the record I am definitely on your side regarding your concerns about pay day loans - they are extremely predatory and getting rid of them ASAP is definitely better where financially possible. In my line of work I see them ruin people every single day, particularly vulnerable people like your girlfriend. 

I wish you both the best of luck with this unfortunate situation."
b0le85,"NTA. That kind of nit picky attitude is not part of sharing. I mean she may use less because she's out of the house a bit but she also may have devices that are constantly hooked up (eg mini fridge) or stuff that uses a lot of power when she uses it.

Besides it's very challenging to figure out exactly what everyone will owe and then you would have to configure it again if someone has a change in employment/goes on a trip/ etc. Just don't go there. 

You may be able to argue that she takes up more space, has a bigger room etc.

Besides it sounds like bullshit. Y"

b0lznq,"NTA. You're not in the wrong for wanting the situation to change to benefit you and your father if what you're saying about her being abusive and rude to the both of you. You're free to feel how you want about the situation, especially if you've been through the things you have mentioned. But I should also point out that while you do have some possible influence, the issue of divorce is ultimately their decision. You may play a factor in that decision, but shouldn't plead with your father to do it (I know you're not but just stating a possible scenario). Ultimately you're not wrong for feeling the way you do and telling your Dad how you feel, it is honestly better that he know than for your feelings to be kept hidden."

I was going to go with NAH because I can see where both of you are coming from. My husband is similar to you, in that he doesn't like sudden change especially if it was something he had been planning /looking forward to. I wouldn't love it but I would understand. I would only ask him to cancel if I felt sure I wouldn't be able to manage doing what I need to do /needing help with meds etc without him. 


However, given your 'maybe we should just divorce' and 'I can go next year if I'm still alive' comments makes you seem immature. It seems like you have a very poor me attitude and I wonder how much communication you're having re this situation with your wife and how much you're just bitching and looking for validation on this sub. "
b0mctp,"NTA this isn't you being petty because your ex was kinda snappy and not great at the end of your relationship, this woman's actual safety is at risk. I think it's totally reasonable to give her a warning, send screenshots if she wants proof, and jf she wants to ignore you what happens from there is not your problem. "
b0mia0,"YTA, or more accurately, your mom is

>My boyfriend says it’s not my problem or responsibility, that she’s a grown woman that can take care of herself.

This right here. She is the mother. It is NOT your job to take care of her bad decisions. She seriously sounds like she is going to drag you down and screw up your life.

> I told him I wanna stay for another year or 2 max to help her

You are making excuses. There will always be a reason to stick it out a little longer. It will never be the perfect time to leave.

> I DON'T EVEN LIKE KIDS AND DON'T PLAN ON HAVING ANY

If this is true, why the hell are you wasting your youth raising your mother's kid?
"
b0mjjh,"NTA. Having a baby at 26 years old is definitely NOT too young to have a kid (as your grandmother is saying). And the issue seems to revolve around your grandmother, as I'm willing to bet both mom's and aunt's abortions were done because of your grandmother thinking they were ""too young"". I'd say it's ok to wait until the pregnancy occurs if that's the response you're getting. "
b0mkbj,"NTA - and honestly if this was me I’d look into getting custody of my little brother. 

But honestly you aren’t obligated to send them money at all. So $100 is generous. "
b0moec,"NTA: If you do it in a polite way like you plan to, I don't see an issue with it. You don't want them to get injured and don't want the liability. Any parent with common sense would respect this request. I'm sure it be different if you lived in a ""normal"" neighborhood, but that is clearly not the case."
b0mw9a,"NTA.  Don't care what your agreement was.  Parent Plus loans aren't even your responsibility.

Edit: wrong word"
b0mybn,"NTA. Kind of. 


I understand trying to feel like you're saving face with the woman, but it may also just be time to cut her (the sister) out of your life. Recognize that you are not responsible for her, her behaviour, or anything else she does. If your wife is not comfortable with the confrontation, then she should not be forced into it. Right now I'm sure she feels stuck in the middle between wanting to defend her husband from the terrible things her sister is saying, and trying to maintain the peace, because such confrontations with such a terrible person may ostracize your wife from other family functions where she enjoys being around everyone else. 

Sometimes the best form of confrontation is the absolute lack of contact. 

If your wife cannot do it, and still insists on going to events with her, politely decline, and don't go. You are not forced to maintain a relationship with her. It's not your sister. If your wife, who is an individual person, still feels obligated, she is free to do so. 

If neither of you gain anything by confronting this woman, that can't be gained by a total shut out without the stress, then severe ties. You wouldn't be the first people to do so. 


"
b0myzb,"NAH. It's perfectly reasonable to not want someone in your own home who causes you discomfort. In the same sense, you're SO has an equal say in who gets to come over. Have you have a chance to discuss you're discomfort with his friend? If your SO continually just says ""Hes just like that"" that means the issue is more with your SO as he is not taking your concerns seriously enough. Remember some people can easily turn a blind eye to the ones they are close to, and it takes a lot of effort to see things from a different perspective. "
b0mzpq,NAH  - this is one of the few times I personally think it's okay to miss a funeral - It sounds like it would be an actual hardship for you to go - not wanting to travel super far while your fiancee is pregnant is totally understandable especially since you will soon need the days. As long as your mom understands and is okay with it I wouldn't worry about anyone else -you can always to a grave visit next time you are there. 
b0n18o,"NAH

Doesnt make you an asshole for wanting sex, but bloody sex is not for everyone..."
b0n3e9,I’m gonna say NTA you’re asking your dad for money to help with school it’s not like your wasting it your siblings are just mad they didn’t get the same treatment 
b0nbfc,"YTA - why didn't you just wait with her, instead of trying to pressure things by going outside?  why did you continue waiting and growing in anger for 1.5 hrs before going back in the first time?  why did you wait *another* 1.5hrs outside after that?  you didn't communicate at all... just acted passive-aggressive and then sat there seething for 3 hrs.  of course you feel bad after that. 

also, everyone knows you don't trust a drunk person who says ""10 minutes"" lmao."

He’s the A here. Wow. You told him specifically “Don’t do the thing because of this reason and that reason.”  You reminded him “Don’t do the thing.”

He goes and does the thing. 

You tell him “Remember I asked you not to do the thing?” and he somehow doesn’t get it.  "
b0nfut,"NAH but you're probably at a crossroads.

Did you really think anyone would call you an asshole for not wanting more kids?"
b0ngwe,"YTA 

I think you should just leave her alone. She’s developing her sense of understanding in the world and it’ll take time for her to find a proper stance. However anything that needs a swastika to be funny probably isn’t. So I’m definitely glad she reported that. "
b0nmfu,"NAH although I would say you're being a bit inconsiderate of his feelings. Of course he's upset, most people would be upset if their partner was close friends with someone they hooked up with or with an ex"
b0nr1c,"YTA. I was terrified of dogs as a young person due to being attacked. I am fine now, but large dogs I don’t know still make me wary. If my husband tried to force me to get a big dog and then dismissed my fear, I’d be pretty upset. "
b0nsxl,"If he wants to come I say let him if:

A) He pays his own way.

B) If you're staying with her family he sorts his own accommodation.


From what I'm reading it looks like he wants a free ride and you don't have to grant that. NTA"
b0nux0,"YTA. I’ve been working in a restaurant for three years and I hate when people order carry out and then decide to eat it there. Sure, they may have not have been busy but they also may have been saving that table. It is also a sneaky way for people to not tip because it’s carryout but you occupied a space. Not saying this was you, but that’s how it feels sometimes. 

Unless you told someone that you decided to eat there, then it was inconsiderate of you. "
b0nwjo,"NTA

Dump him, he sounds like an immature asshole who doesn’t know how relationships work. You are entitled to feel the way you do, and I honestly don’t blame you for feeling a little neglected. 

You deserve better."
b0nyf8,"NAH

You're not being an asshole by being fed up and he probably could find a better way to vent, but I think we all need the safe space to do that (even when we're refusing to see ourselves as the problem).

I think it could be a better use of your time to stop him and ask a very simple question, ""Do you want my help or do you just want to complain?"" Ask him that question and respect his answer. If he says he wants help and then refuses your suggestions, stop the conversation and walk away from it. But you may find that he pauses and says, ""You know what, I just want to complain"" and then you can save yourself the headache of arguing with a brick wall. Even if you disagree with his complaints, let him vent. If he can get all the anger and frustration out, he'll be more receptive to criticism. "
b0o0n3,"NAH - unfortunately being young lends itself to poor decision making which is why I won’t say they’re assholes in this situation.

Brought up in the correct context this is absolutely something you could talk to them about. They’ve ventured down an irresponsible path that could alter their futures significantly. 

Just make sure it’s from a place of concern and not judgment. "
b0o1cm,"NTA

This doesn’t seem like much of a friend. He knows your goals and you seem committed to them. He pressures you into a lunch you didn’t want to go to, orders too much food and then guilt trips you for not eating enough when he knew you have goals that would prevent you from that. He has no regard for your personal family issues and only cares about himself when you couldn’t afford to return the favour. Look into toxic relationships because he really doesn’t seem worth your time to be honest."
b0o2a5,"NTA

She's doing the same thing you are, but worse since it actually falls on your anniversary, and refusing to see reason. That sucks."
b0o5g9,"YTA. This discussion should have happened before you ever offered to host the event, but your husband still managed to be very accommodating despite there really being no reason to be in the first place. 

Why anyone would be made uncomfortable by an inanimate object on a wall is so beyond me, but I do get that guns illicit stong reactions from people. I'd let him leave it there and if anyone brought it up I'd have your husband explain the significance of the weapon and if they still can't come to terms with it then they're the asshole as well.

b0ok5l,"NTA, you're going to likely have a NEWBORN with you, and her response to this is getting angry and then paying for your trip.

She should have asked you before setting plans with her family to make this happen.

b0p0qz,"NTA - Your father's bullshit detector (and yours) went off and he was having none of it. This woman was playing the victim card hard, and as soon as people were giving her some lip went from pathetic to angry. That's very juvenile behavior, probably why your dad recognized it. You and your sib probably behaved like that yourself in the past - got reprimanded and learned how to be responsible adults. Maybe this lady didn't benefit from proper parenting.

Either way, it doesn't excuse using a dead son (true or not) to gain some kind of moral advantage over you. That's low, and exactly what she was trying to do. Your dad dealt with it harshly. But honestly? I'd probably have said something similar to shut this victim act down."
b0p1xw,"NTA.
You sent more than enough reminders for him to get his shit together. And since this wasn't his first time he should have known.

I think however, it’s important to keep in mind that no matter how well-behaved and loving your pet is, it is still an animal in a loud and confusing world. Animals act in unexpected ways and are triggered by weird things. Always bear that in mind with your pupper.

On the other side, if you’ve got a nasty dog that gets hurt for punching above it’s weight, that is poor training and the fault is the owner’s.

I get where you're coming from (you have to look out for number one) but this one guy is not actually competition when it comes down it. It's very, very unlikely that HE will be the reason you don't land a job. There are likely thousands of people with that recruiter's information reaching out for jobs, so I don't really see the harm in handing it over since it's basically public information.

However, I don't think he needed to call you a dick.

b0qd89,"NTA. You get to dress how you want. Him feeling threatened when you get your mental health sorted out is actually  a huge red flag. It all sounds like he sees you as his ""project""--someone to improve an shape how he sees fit. Of course, we have a very limited view of your relationship form just one post, but if this is an ongoing thing and he feels threatened by you becoming more self-confident, this marriage might not be worth saving.

b0qmsz,"NTA - You're right, it is weird that she takes their pictures but it's not really your issue. I'd just tell her that it's weird and stalkerish just so she knows it's not normal behavior and move on. It sounds like you've already done that, so nothing you can really do. One day she'll look back on this and cringe hard tho"
b0qmzz,NTA- Youve tried to reach out to him. Asking if he would like to see your child. He has clearly made no effort into meeting your child. 
b0qp8x,This is pathetic immaturity. Who cares how much she likes another guy and what she thinks of your relationship. 
b0qqn7,YTA. You should have asked your boss for the charity number. If he couldn't provide one you should have contacted the IRS. You can't steal to right a wrong. It also doesn't help that you have pretty much none of the facts.

b0r687,"NAH you did what you felt was right

but i will say as someone who used to work with people who were highly prone to seizures, not all seizures require medical attention. it's scary as shit if youve never seen someone have one before but, as odd as it may sound, sometimes after someone has had a seizure they're mostly fine. tired, not feeling their best, and probably embarrassed, but not in need of medical attention. it's likely whoever said not to call 911 knew enough about this person's condition to know they were in the category of people who would not need to see a doctor. 

now, that said, there's no way YOU could have known that and you saw someone in medical distress and called for help. that's the right thing to do every single time."
b0r6g3,NTA Hes probably scared and upset with himself but its not an excuse to not pull his weight. Maybe throw a couple job options at him.
b0r714,"NAH. I think your reaction is normal (it's ok to find others attractive!), and you handled it well by ending the conversation."
b0r8fy,"NAH - One thing to keep in mind is that this is a REALLY great way to ensure that your daughter grows to dislike and resent her grandparents.

I'd work on baby steps.  Find a halfway point, and also, sit down and spend some time explaining that family dynamics are different everywhere, and your wife's family just so happens to have this one.  Ask her, don't tell her, to think about making time once every couple of weeks to talk to her grandparents on the phone for a few minutes, or if she'll set up some skype calls or something.

If you guys force it, she's going to dislike it and resent it, and resent you for making her do it, because it's not currently part of HER family culture."

Yes, he's the asshole here, but it's the least of your problems. You're 21. Divorce this child and go live your life. "
b0row0,"NAH, but I think straight up ghosting her would kind of lead into YTA territory. I don't think you should just abandon her with no explanation, that can be scary if she's really attached to you and you haven't met in person. If you just stop talking to her it could just escalate her emotions because she might be wondering if something serious happened to you or overtly and constantly questioning what she did wrong.

If I was you, I'd write her a sort of unofficial letter of sorts just explaining your emotions and that you want to stop talking indefinitely, and then stop talking to her. Give her some closure, don't just abandon her.

EDIT: after you give her some sort of explanation, I don't think you'd be the asshole to stop talking to her. It's not necessarily the kindest thing to do, but if she's making you uncomfortable and being weird then it's a somewhat valid response to cut it off."
b0rp8u,"NTA

b0ru8q,"NAH you don't need a reason to break up if you're not into someone. That said, you would be TA if you stayed with her despite not finding her attractive, especially since she's now worrying about losing weight for you. Don't do that to her. "
b0rv3f,NTA. Just because someone's blood doesn't mean you have to like them. 
b0rvs6,"NTA if you actually refund her what she paid. She cheated on you, I wouldn’t worry about what she’s thinking. "
b0rwwr,NTA - if you do it respectfully
b0s1gf,"NAH - you’re both entitled to your own opinions, just as you’re entitled to do whatever you want with that information. He may prefer the brown (and definitely could have been more tactful), but it’s your hair, do what makes you happiest."
b0s1o0,YTA for sure. No debate. 
b0s3up,"NTA. Why would you even tip 5%? I would have argued for a free meal, because you didn't even get the food you ordered."
b0s5ae,"NAH. It sounds like your aunt was having a stressful day, and this was all a huge misunderstanding. When you finally get a chance to speak with your aunt, apologize and explain your perspective. "
b0s5cb,"YTA. Mind your business. 

Edit: YWBTA*"
b0s794,"NAH. You're upset about losing your job, and he felt like he was being attacked. It sounds like a misunderstanding. "
b0s7eg,"NAH. 

I understand you not wanting him there, but your friend also is allowed to invite who she wants. If he does end up coming then you’ll just have to put it behind you for the night. Good luck OP"
b0s87b,"NTA. As a lifelong gamer that kind of behavior is unbelievably hated among the vast majority of gamers, myself included. He needs to learn boundaries and one way to do so is to confront him about it. Skirting around or ingoring it will only make it worse."
b0s8gf,"NTA. That's like inviting everyone on a cruise, and then putting your 5 oldest friends in the engine room with not enough beds, while everyone else is in first class. You are allowed to be unhappy.  If you had known, you might not have come at all."
b0saev,"NTA.   The artist line is bullshit, let's move past that. 

I feel like victims of cheating always deserve to know the truth."
b0scwk,"INFO. Are they always asking your opinion? Or do they say that they like something and you give your unsolicited opinion? 

I mean, if They're asking what you think then they can't be angry when you're honest. But if they're like ""I like this band"" for instance, and you automatically say ""i think they're shit"" , then I'd go with YTA"
b0seps,"YTA dude that’s pretty fucked tbh. You didn’t have to have sex with her, but like if she caught you jerking it a couple hours later to some other girls on the internet after you said you didn’t want to have sex with her, then that’s fucked. She has a right to be mad, like flip the situation, if you tried having sex with her and she said no, but then found out soon after that she preferred watching other guys have sex, then that’d make you feel pretty shitty. Probably made her feel like you’re not attracted to her. And if you didn’t recognize that on your own, idk what to tell you"
b0sf0k,"NTA but your title is misleading ... seems like you kicked him out for having an explosive fit, not just for not going on the family trip. "
b0sgbs,NTA unless you had some way of easily finding the owner and didn't.  
b0shyr,"NAH - You have the right to be upset, and he has the right to go.

You'd be the asshole if you gave him some kind of ultimatum or otherwise manipulated him into changing his plans.

You can agree ahead of time to plan a trip together next year if that's what you want."
b0sr0d,Her mum literally died and you’re taking the days where she’s going to have to attend the funeral out of her holiday entitlement. Does what she’s doing on those days sound like a holiday OP?! Of course YTA.
b0ssd4,"NTA

If you’re still paying off loans, you don’t have money. You have debt.

Please continue being responsible with your finances and maybe reconsider why you’re with this person."
b0sv91,"YTA. Lists or scorecards are never a good idea, it looks like you're tallying their faults to overwhelm them with proof of how shitty they are.

There are more constructive ways to address this issue, and it's a common issue, so google it and try something else."
b0svrf,"YTA Partnered dance is different then just regular club dancing. It's a really fun activity that you CAN'T do without a partner (usually one of the opposite sex as leading and following is not the same role.) If you're uncomfortable go to one of these dance nights and check it out, everyone dances with everyone, and many of those people are in relationships or even married and still dance with others even if there partner also dances. also not that it matters but swing is one of the least romantic partnered dance. tango, kizomba, and bachata are way more intense but people still understand boundaries in those communities. "
b0swec,"NTA at all. It’s super normal not to want people to be all PDA in front of you, especially when you’re the only other person there. You can gently tell them that you love hanging out with them but their public displays of affection make you uncomfortable and you’d like for things to be less affectionate when you’re around. "
b0sy6l,"NTA, friends don't offer ultimatums on things unless it's like murder or something, opinions are values, he can't tale that away from you. If you think he's a generally good person but just being irrational in the heat of the moment offer him a chance to apologize. "
b0sy8e,"NAH.

Wow this is like the Regina/Gretchen situation over the gold hoops.

She can’t claim a style. If you like it, you like it. As long as it’s not the EXACT same ring (I would still respect that aspect), it should be totally fine. A real friend would be excited for you!"
b0sztz,"NTA.  He broke curfew, to get drunk no less.  It's your home and you were being kind to him allowing him to stay there.  Your home your rules."
b0t2jh,"YTA. She thought you were a broke bum. You made her subsidize your ticket, made her use her car because yours is a POS, and then tried to get a loan from her? I mean, WTF dude, how'd you think this was gonna go?  You'd have to be really good looking to pull that off.

I ain't saying she's a gold digger, but she ain't messing with no broke... well, you get the idea.  She's not a gold digger."
b0t4f2,"YTA but it sounds like you already know that. You didn't have the energy for the friendship when you were in your relationship, and now you can't talk as much because her life is going well. 

You can have as much space as you want, from whomever you want, but expecting her to be there when you're ready and for her feelings toward you not to change is what makes you the asshole."
b0t4tp,"YTA, how can you say you like doing this for your friends, and then get mad that one of them isn’t bringing something? Are you truly doing this because you like to..? 

Yes that guy keeps “forgetting” and not bringing things, but you’re the one who invited him. It reflects more on his character than yours by him not bringing anything. And now you’re going to uninvite him because he didn’t do something nice for you too?!"
b0t4zg,"YTA. It's for people to play nice music and busk, not for practice. He's torturing everyone for his selfish benefit."
b0t7lj,"NTA 
Honestly it's pretty strange that he wants to go out spring breaking at this age. And with the fact that he already had a week of drinking it really seems like he should take a break"
b0t7uk,"NTA

Quiet hours doesnt mean you're allowed to be as loud as you want the rest of the time. Blasting music so loud it shakes the walls is obviously too loud and they should know that. Also if they were trying to hide a ton of weed then they shouldn't have made a nuisance of themselves. "
b0t9od,NTA. That shit drives me crazy too.
b0tc09,"YTA. Your parents treat you and your wife like shit, and your response is ""well, they always have treated me like shit, so whatever."" That's not OK with her, obviously. Grow some nuts in that sack and stand up for yourself and your wife."
b0tcm9,ESH they shouldn't leave such annoying gaps and you shouldn't try and squeeze into a clearly too small space. 
b0tdap,"NTA, she can get her own room and plan her own vacation, lol"
b0tedw,YTA - or YWBTA. It’s your sister’s birthday! Don’t ruin it for her by making it about yourself because you “DOnT LiKe DisNeY”
b0teh2,"NAH

The weather isn't their fault, but it sucks that you missed out."
b0teqv,"NAH. It's not a nice thing to do to a friend, but I think it's reasonable to not want to associate with a drug dealer."
b0tfoh,"YTA Jesus, what's wrong with you?"
b0tfxb,"ESH, but this sounds like high school so it’s honestly kind of par for the course. You shouldn’t talk badly about your friends behind their backs. Your friends shouldn’t tell you that they hate you either. Take solace in knowing that as long as nobody actively tries to make a big deal out of it, you guys will remain friends and it will probably be forgotten as long as it doesn’t happen again. "
b0tgzd,"NTA. if he’s been very distant, not treating you like  someone he cares for and blames you for thinking that he’s using you for sex then look back and see if you want to be in a relationship with someone like that."
b0th4a,"YTA. It’s people like you who ruin good faith policies like this or the now-nixed lifetime LL Bean policy. You’ve used and enjoyed the furniture just shy of a year without issue. It has nothing to do with the products manufactured quality, design, or durability, you have just changed your mind on wanting it now that you’re moving. "
b0ths8,NTA. She's trying to push you out of the project and take control; that you're refusing or not playing along has her frustrated. 
b0tiks,NTA: you’re not the asshole for just giving your shit away... 
b0tkdg,yeah i have started to host now that this has happend
b0tpac,"NTA, I'm glad you stepped up and called them out on it when you felt uncomfortable. Most people would have been too nervous to make their discomfort known. Wren should have stopped before you had to ask twice. I don't fault them for wanting to do more than just take out the trash, it's a common nicety and comes from a good place. But the underwear thing is too far."
b0tpvq,"NAH. 

Not sure why you’d think you’re an asshole for not spooking your boyfriend. 

If you ever want to watch a horror movie with him, you could watch the movie first to give him a heads up when jump scares are coming up; I did that with my SO and she really appreciated it. "
b0tty8,"YTA on the basis that I don't believe you were doing you homework. She was clearly not far away, you could pause your video games and go there man.. as a married man, trust me this isn't the battle to take your stand"
b0tv6a,"NAH, mostly. As long as neither of you are immune compromised, it shouldn't be a problem. The cat's butt on the counter isn't any less sanitary than being on the couch, for example. I certainly understand the impulse to view it as gross, but honestly it's a tap that's in the same room as the toilet. If that sort of thing bugs you about the cat it should bother you about the toilet, too. 

Consider that elderly cats often can have kidney and bladder issues. Our oldest has bladder issues and loves to drink out of the sink AND the toilet. We let him simply because we want him to get water in him any way we can. 

In spite of that, though, we also kick the cat out of bed when we need to be more comfortable. It's my bed. The cat has his own if he wants."
b0tvgd,Yta you snitch.
b0twhz,[deleted]
b0txvq,NTA. The longer you drag things out the worse it will be for her. 
b0u054,"NTA 
You're co-worker is a bit of a fool and really inflated the issue immensely.

Please do not bother your HR lady about this. This is such a nonissue for everyone involved and I doubt the vendors would be able to restock that cookie anyways since they have no way of knowing if it has been tampered with or not.

Enjoy your present from the universe and please don't waste any worker's time about it."
b0u08o,"YTA. I can understand wanting to be supportive and helpful, but lying and breaking trust harms more than helps. ‘Fess up, take the heat, and be better than this in the future."
b0u37l,YTA and BS you didn’t know that it would be inappropriate
b0u69w,"NTA. 

I'd recommend checking out r/raisedbynarcissists , there are some good folks there doing great work. 

You are under NO obligation to continue speaking to anyone who is toxic to your health and wellbeing, parent or not. Making the decision to cut out a parent is a difficult one, but you're certainly not TA for making it. 

Edit: Can't spell for the life of me"
b0u8cq,YTA: dude took the time to make you dinner. I'd feel unappreciated AF. 
b0uc11,"NTA. If she wants to wake up earlier, set her own alarms. What would she do if she lived alone?"
b0ucjy,"YTA - Stop pushing for her to kiss you after oral if she doesn't like it or want to do it. If she thinks it smells/tastes weird after you go down on her, give her this compromise; you'll have some scented face wipes beside the bed and a pack of Listerine strips - for directly after the deed and then start kissing. Problem solved. "

While it is perfectly reasonable to not be able to deal with all these stress. It is also not unreasonable for your mom to assume that you are okay with supporting the family, especially when you haven't spoke up.

Perhaps try to add some communication. Keep it as unemotional as possible. Explaining how you also have plan for your life but this situation put you into a hole where you have no room to grow and diminishing your own future, and desire everyone else in the family to help the family equally. if you are not getting support for that, then perhaps someone is a asshole, but until then, I don't think anyone know.

b0uvak,YTA if only because you think anyone cares about your instragram handle

I would suggest you try to have a conversation about this. If you're both just shitty to each other, the only way it's likely to go is to escalate further as you keep retorting to each other. "
b0v1n5,"NAH, I’m so sorry for your loss and I’m so sorry that you’re having to deal with what sounds like a mentally ill parent when you’re grieving. 

Your dad probably realizes that without your mum he can’t care for himself, so wanting to be in assisted living is smart. I know you’re mad at him about the hoard but it is a mental illness. That doesn’t make it easier to deal with when it’s fresh, but it sounds like this may be a wake up call for him. 

My heart hurts for you - my mother died last May and it is really such an awful thing. "
b0v3c2,"NTA based on strictly what's in your post... But there are a lot of red flags here that suggest there may be more to the story. You've been in several group projects and you've *hated* all of them? *All* of them? I know it's a trope for students to dislike group projects but that seems excessive.

And you just decided everyone was going to use slack to communicate? The channel you created and told them all to join? You're worried about your leadership skills here and trying to show strong leadership? You filled out an evaluation form and let them know their short comings? Honestly did someone make you leader, was that your specified role for this project? Or did you just take it upon yourself to tell everyone where they needed improvement and what they were going to be doing? 

Look maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it sounds like there's a real chance here that you're not working well with others. I'm getting a vibe that you might have just decided you're leader and started bossing everyone around.

Even your dad picked up on it. 



While it's absolutely no excuse for why the other students didn't do their work... I kind of get them blowing you off if that's the attitude you expressed to them.


This is just total speculation. Don't take it too seriously. But like I said, a lot of red flags here that have painted a... Suggestion of a picture. "
b0v9hc,"NTA. 

You know you’re not the asshole, come on.

You’re getting married. It’s okay to not want someone partying with you, eating the food you paid for at your reception when they said they won’t come to your ceremony because you’re gay—mother-in-law or not. 

You’re not persecuting her for being catholic. You’re setting appropriate boundaries."
b0v9pr,"NTA but I’m wondering, do you plan on going back there?"
b0vaiu,"For me it depends on why she's telling you to do it. Did you promise and/or agree to do so? Is this generally considered your obligation? Have you in the past said ""give me 2 seconds"" and not done so? 

She's undeniably an asshole for the headphone smacking, there's no way around that, but I can't help but to imagine you provoked her on some level. "
b0vcva,NTA. You recognized that this was your illness and took proper steps to calm yourself down. Sounds like he is overreacting by far and maybe using this particular situation to show pent up feelings about your illness in general. 
b0vgee,"NTA , it doesn’t matter that you are friends with her kid, she’s running a business and needs to pay her employees. That was super unprofessional and illegal of her. Good for you for reporting it. "

And why are you with this guy? He's making you feel neglected and his friends are douchy snobs..."
b0vp6z,Nta. You two are not exactly in a committed relationship. You don't have to go on a date with him even if what he said was true (and I agree it sounds fishy). 
b0vzpf,"YTA. In fact, everyone in the office is an asshole for participating in shaming this woman. No wonder she doesn't want to be less than a ""new coworker"" with you, as you are literally making fun of everything she says. She has every right to be pissed off, and frankly, in some states, the company can be in trouble for enabling a hostile workplace."
b0w4b4,YTA especially for ghosting her over it. Yeah she didn't wait for you but she's in school cut her some slack for doing something with her friends. She deserves to do college things too.
b0w5rc,NTA. I would try to find someone else who can help or put him in a nursing home. Your health matters too. Good luck my friend.
b0w69m,NTA - Talking shit about people behind their back to others broods distrust in the relationship which will likely ruin the relationship. That was a pretty harsh way to teach that lesson but I'd bet it worked.
b0w894,"ESH.  Don’t get me wrong, your friend is a MASSIVE asshole. However, you say that you consider him a real friend and he’s been there for you through a lot. I don’t think you’re a very good friend to him if you’re trying to get together with his ex when she’s in a really vulnerable place and if you’re lying to him about it/hiding it from him.

You need to ditch this guy if you want to have any sort of relationship with his ex, platonic or not.  Or decide that his friendship is more valuable to you, since he’s been reliable.  In this situation I don’t think you can have it both ways

That said, this girl has been through a lot, and as someone who has been in an abusive relationship before: getting immediately into a relationship with you is not coming from a place of love.  It’s coming from a place of desperation and emptiness. Getting out of a relationship like that it similar to withdrawing from a drug - she wants that next dopamine hit from you because it’s hard to go without it. You can be a good friend to her without taking advantage of the situation.  Help connect her with resources, see if she’ll talk to someone.  "
b0w98d,"NAH. You're concerned about her and if she's crying and constantly complaining it could be something a lot worse then general aches and pains.

I'm guessing she's probably putting it off because she knows it will be  something bad, is scared of the results, possibly doesn't have the money for the appointment and/or follow up visits."
b0w9yo,"NAH.

It would have been very nice of you to tell him, but you don't necessarily owe that to him. "
b0wcwh,"NAH, while it's good to be concerned about your friend she has attained the age of consent in most civilised nations and has the freedom to be with any guy she chooses. If he doesn't seem abusive then I don't see any reason to interfere. "
b0wm5q,"NTA
i don't think you're in the wrong.if he is doing these terrible things (especially beating your sister) then you have a totally valid reason to not give them your blessing.
even if he makes her happy,these behaviours are toxic and are not good for a relationship. if he is actively trying to change is ways and attempting to fix his mistakes,then maybe you'd be wrong for not giving your blessing,but from this post it seems like he is completely unfit for a relationship,especially marriage."
b0wp96,YTA - you are snooping and your husband isn’t doing anything wrong based on your agreement 
b0wrwy,"NTA bordering on NAH, it's a shitty situation, you have no obligation to change your life or schedule to accommodate their difficulties and they shouldn't expect you to. That being said I wouldn't judge them too harshly since I can definitely empathize with where they're coming from. I'd recommend trying to come to some sort of compromise but ultimately if it'll be too hard on you then you're not an asshole for standing your ground."
b0wsxq,NTA seems like she isn’t the person you thought she was when you made that promise. only person you owe happiness to is yourself 
b0wzeb,SHP this is AITA not r/relationship_advice

"
b0x9id,"Ehhh I’m gonna go with NTA. I would have flipped my shit if someone did that to me, but I also watch a lot of Dateline and 48 Hours so anytime I’m somewhere unfamiliar my first thoughts are making sure I keep tabs on everyone. 

It would’ve been different if she’d at least sent a text. I can understand going off by yourself, even if you came with someone else, but for the love of god tell someone. Even if it’s just the bartender or a bouncer. 

I do kind of think you suck for making her leave the guy then and there. After you found out where she was you should’ve just let her know you wanted to be notified about where she was, then left her to it. "

b0xd7g,"YTA.

Okay this isn’t going to be popular, but it’s the truth.

First off, you are making a lot of negative judgements about GF’s parents (narcissism, alcoholism, controlling) and positive ones about yourself (free and open with your son’s sexuality). You didn’t ask about this, but it’s there - you obviously feel superior to her parents. That’s okay, but it’s clouding your judgement here. Pretend they are the awesomest, greatest parents alive who don’t share your feelings on your son and their daughter having a sexual relationship. Now with that in mind, can you see YTA?

If not, let me expand. They obviously don’t want their daughter to be sexually active. While this may not be a realistic expectation for a 16 year old, it is a reasonable one - and one that many parents of teen daughters share. The fact that you don’t care about your son being sexually active doesn’t matter.

Now that doesn’t mean you are the guardian of her chastity, but you knew what they expected and not only did you betray what you said you’d do (adult always present), you actually encouraged the kids to do what you *knew* her parents didn’t want. This makes you the a-hole. You could have said you couldn’t be there the whole time or you could have said you don’t agree with their viewpoint.

~~I actually think you get a YTA+ because you know the kids are sexually active.~~ **(edit: see below)** This conversation between the the dads, or a follow-up would be a good time to let them in on that secret. It’s really only fair for them to know that while your first allegiance is to your son, his desire to get laid does not outweigh your responsibility to the parents to let them make decisions about their daughter, which is their right, no matter how controlling.

If it helps, I agree with your parenting style and your take on the situation. Also, high-five for being a cool mom that acknowledges teen lust and prefers the kids to be safe at home then god knows where else. :)

**EDIT:** Wow, thanks for all the feedback! I can't respond to everyone, but figured I would add a few thoughts here. First off, while I appreciate the comments on my judgement, please remember to leave a top-level vote for u/tripperfunster since she's the one asking for feedback. Also, you kind folks aren't the first to call me an A-Hole, and certainly won't be the last! So here's some more fodder for everyone to complain about...

Yes, many 16 year olds have sex. This is not a crisis. But most 16 year olds are not equipped to handle the outcome of this, namely pregnancy. There are lots of other consequences and I'm not dismissing them, but most can be resolved in time, however the impact of pregnancy lasts a lifetime. If it is terminated, that is not something easily forgotten. And if carried to term, raising a child is a lifelong commitment. No birth control is 100% effective - pregnancy is always a risk. Therefore, its reasonable for parents to *wish* their kids not have sex at 16. However, it may not be reasonable for the parents to expect they can *enforce* abstinence for their teens. Further, I don't think its wise for parents to advocate abstinence only - teens should be educated on safe sex using condoms and birth control.

A popular criticism of my comment is that the mother should not inform the GF's parents they are sexually active. I figured people would not like that part, and I don't expect to get a lot of agreement on my perspective. Perhaps the first time it comes up, it doesn't make sense to say anything. But if GF's parents assume that BF's parents agree the kids should be having sex, and the relationship continues, and BF's parents know... it would feel like a giant lie to keep up the charade that everyone is protecting the kids chastity when BF's parents know for sure that is not the case. For all we know, the love blossoms and OP may have several more years of covering up the truth ahead. If they at some point become in-laws, it will be awkward when GF parents find out, and that kind of thing always comes out.

But after careful consideration, I will remove the YTA+ judgement because OP should not be expected to bear all the burden of the kids' activities. GF parents should wake up and realize what's going on and be part of the solution."

b0y9s1,"NAH, I think?

It probably would have been better to tell her the truth at the outset, but you're not a bad person (or TA) for having told the lie, as that was an awkward situation.

This isn't an advice sub so I'm cheerfully passing on what you should do now, that depends on what sort of person she is and your relationship and trust levels and all sorts of things. But whether it was the right thing to do is kind of... IDK, hard to tell, but it seems pretty harmless."
b0ymk0,"Edit: YTA, sorry but when she tried to exit the discussion politely you should have allowed that. Just because you want to have a conversation with someone doesn't mean that they are required to have it.

b0z5ab,"NTA, although I wouldn't necessarily say he *doesn't have* issues. But whether or not he has these issues, what he's doing is not OK.

She has you trapped in an emotionally abusive relationship based on her needs, with no concern for yours whatsoever. She has used you and your feelings for herself, and has shown that she is, at this point in time, incapable of love, or any feelings that don't revolve around her and her wants and needs. Run. As fast as you can, and don't look back. 

Edit: the only reason that things have gotten to the point they have is because she is trying to find different ways to control you and bring you back to her. As each attempt fails, she will escalate the next one until she has your full and undivided attention, and the second she has that, things will go back to normal for you two. 

The worst thing you can do for someone with these kind of mental health issues is to play their games. It continues the cycle that allows their self destructive behaviour to be perceived as beneficial, and they have no reason to search for change. She is getting help now, but will not continue it if she sees that her ill behaviour and poisonous actions still get her what she wants. You sticking around and participating in her abuse will keep her from actually healing. People like her have to hit rock bottom before they seek help and start moving up. You sticking around is keeping her from achieving that. 


You also owe it to yourself and your new gf to allow a healthy relationship to develop, without outside influences.

This situation sucks. You're now stuck (thanks to your wife) between a dog that may harm your son, and a wife who thinks all this is funny.

When I look at shit like this I think to myself ""is this a hill to die on."" That is, is it worth blowing up your relationship--since that is a possible outcome if you abscond with the dog in the middle of the night and dump him with the SPCA a couple of towns over.

In this case? He bit your son.

So I'd probably go one more round with your wife. I'd inform her that the dog bit your son, that I'm having none of it. I'm afraid the dog is a danger to our child. And I would explain why to me, this is the hill to die on--this is worth blowing up the relationship. (Edit to add:) In other words, make it clear what you are doing, why you are doing, how important it is to do it--and don't just wimp out and make the dog disappear in the middle of the night, since that will lead to less short-term anger, but a lot of long-term resentment."

You should be having a conversation with your vet about what they recommend.  Maybe it's time to euthanize her.  If not, there is probably something you can be doing (other than nothing) to make her more comfortable and happy, which would probably help the behavior problems.

I am somewhat judgmental of multiple showers, but this woman has very graciously sent you new baby and Christmas gifts.  It is ridiculous for you to act like she's being gift grabby by mailing you gifts.

I don't think you owe people a gift just because they sent you one, but I am surprised your husband has never sent his nieces and nephews any kind of gifts.  Money is appropriate, but the cheaper option would be something like a board game for the family.  I have a hard time trusting your ""SIL is picky"" comment when you have only met them once.

Racism isn't just ""treating people differently"" because of their race--it's the suppression and denigration of people based on their race. In an ideal world, we could say the exact same things to anyone, regardless of race, and have our intent understood. But we don't live in that world. We live in a world in which particular groups have been historically marginalized, and the massive impacts of marginalization have shaped the world we live in today.

There is a pretty negative history to calling black men ""boy."" Your black friend may or may not be offended or feel slighted by the comment. Some might suggest that because he hasn't said anything, it must mean he isn't impacted by it. But that's not necessarily the case. Marginalized people have to pick and choose their battles.

I'd kinda lean towards NAH if you're both in your late 20s or something, but if you're college aged asking her to give up family is big.

Edit : After seeing your edits, I'm not so sure anymore. If she told her parents about previous boyfriends without repercussions, then she doesn't have to worry about being ostracized. You probably need to have a serious conversation with her about why she doesn't want to do it for you, and take it from there."

b1i41p,"YTA. A bit. This seems pretty unhealthy, and I'm not going to go into detail, but everyone's body is different. Your boyfriend may have had issues with scarring in the past, and just because you don't get scars from popping pimples doesn't mean someone else won't. In addition to this, it could very well be painful for him.

If you get this anxious over your boyfriend's acne I would consider looking into some therapy, because obsessions like this are completely anxiety-based and not normal.

edit: If you truly do experience this much anxiety when not being able to pop your SO's pimples, I would say you should not be popping them at all from now on-- as it will only encourage your anxiety and/or become an unhealthy coping technique. This really doesn't seem like something your boyfriend should have to compromise with you on with a truce, and he shouldn't be popping zits just to ease your mind."

You on the other hand are also completely reasonable in your request to play poker with your buddies that you only see once a year.

b1iv2a,"NAH - Of course you should be adjusting your behavior when you're in a relationship vs single.   


Dancing obviously can be very sexual. It's up to the two of you to decide what behavior is acceptable within the confines of your relationship. You've decided you don't like her dancing with random men anymore. She can now decide what to do with that information.  


This becomes about control vs request. You can't tell her to do what to do or not do. You can only tell her how you feel, and then she needs to decide how to address that fact.   


If you can't reach a common ground, you decide where to go from there.  


It doesn't sound like you've made her do anything, but that you've merely tried to explain how you feel and to get her to understand how she may feel if the situation were reversed. I do agree that given societal gender roles, its not a 1:1 situation."

b1kvtk,"YTA. You have a responsibility to that child. You don’t get the throw your hands on the air and give up. She never got to chose to be brought into that. Your stepdaughter reeks of Borderline personality disorder/complex trauma. Especially attachment trauma. That happens before the age of two. Which is never the child’s fault. You need to find a new therapist. Preferably one who knows trauma and adverse childhood experiences, and attachment theory. You are the adult here. You have to figure out how to give that child the safe secure place she needs and has clearly never had. Get her into dialectical behavior therapy. 

You are failing her, you are continuing to  traumatize her. Understand something not all trauma is abuse, and something may very well traumatize a child that wouldn’t traumatize and adult. You cannot abandon her now. It won’t be productive. Please for the love of god inform yourself and do the right thing. That child doesn’t need to end up dead on the streets. If you continue down this road that is a very real possibility because of the neurobiology of these things. My ex wife did. Tough love doesn’t work. The studies show. This is just bad parenting all around.

b1lr0x,"NTA

I will start off by saying I am a stoner. I smoke for recreational and medical purposes. Regularly. I have spent over 300$ on a glass piece that I use twice a year. (it's beautiful. Truly a work of art. It's a heavenly pearl pink with swatches of light baby blue rippling through it. Fricking gorgeous.)  But Jesus Christ not that regularly. When I'm not using it for migraines, I treat it (as should everyone) like alcohol. A beer after work is fine. A few on the weekend is a great time. Day drinking at the beach with friends? No problem. But not everyday all day, and not alone.

Contrary to popular belief, weed can be habit forming. Anything can be habit forming. If you find that you have a hard time doing things you used to enjoy sober, now without help? You might have a problem.

It's true that it is not like nicotine in that you are instantly addicted, but even I was addicted to reading as a kid to escape, and that's supposed to be good for you! But I was addicted. 

It sounds like he is legitimately addicted, and is having withdrawal symptoms when he tries to cut back.. Nothing dangerous, people with substance abuse problems tend to find their own way out of things after a few years. (Except alcohol. That shit...  It fucks you up.) 


Five to seven years is the average for heavy pot smokers. If he really means to cut back, it's best for him to just go cold turkey and do a cleanse to bring his tolerance down. It is not unusual for recreational substance users to do a 30-60 day detox once or twice a year. 


It may be worth it to bring it up to him as a suggestion, but in the end, he has to be the one to decide if that's what he wants. If so, support him, but don't get mad when he falls off the wagon. Withdrawal symptoms are hard to manage; anxiety, elevated levels of stress, easy to anger, inability to sleep, racing thoughts, cravings, etc, are all symptoms of withdrawal symptoms from weed. As long as he is legitimately trying, compassion and empathy are key. 

If he continues to disregard your feelings on this, or falls off the wagon and never gets back on, it is then up to you to decide if you can date and possibly have a future with this person. It's not to say either one of you is good or bad, but if his lifestyle is not what you are looking for, you owe it to both of you to move on. "

You just finished climaxing and you immediately had to bring up how she could better meet your preferences by changing herself.

NTA for having preferences, or even voicing them. But what you did was tactless and inconsiderate. Like right after you start dating you’re asking her to change her body.

I’m firmly in the field of letting parents raise their kids their own way, and sometimes they might have this grand plan in mind that might not be apparent. We’re humans, not mind readers. So I think it’s pretty rude of you to shove your nose in like that, try to tell him how to raise his son even if he’s kinda rude. Like you said that’s just how P is.  He might be working on something with K you’re not aware of, especially since you only heard through hearsay that K isn’t doing so great. 

You just not only assumed P’s intent, but told him how he feels, and that he doesn’t love his son. That’s a pretty heavy fucking thing to say to a parent. 

On the other hand, you just told him his son is depressed, maybe he didn’t tell you and maybe he took it to heart and might change something, but I think refusing to acknowledge your good intent and atleast saying something wasn’t great either on his part, and only escalated the situation.

At the end of the day, what you said was NOT okay, even if he’s also responsible for it escalating. "

Its shitty, and I don’t have a room mate, but if I did and they quit their job like that and couldn’t pay their fair share of the bills I would kick them out. You didn’t agree to support someone else. 

That being said, if you guys bitch about your jobs that much, that’s not healthy. Yeah yeah, “everyone hates their job” (We don’t.

this is a HUGE vacation you have planned, and while your wife fucked up, her punishment is the toll taken on her body, you going without her is completely unnecessary and further punishment she doesn’t deserve. Get your money back, take a staycation so you get your time off work, and replan the trip for when you can both go.

You say you’re the primary wage earner, and it sounds like your wife stays home to take care of your child. If that’s true, that counts as a full-time job, stop being an asshole about how much money you earn. If she didn’t stay home with the kid, you would have to pay for daycare/a nanny.

This post comes off as you going “well since you did a shitty thing I’m going to repurpose our grand trip to go with my friend. Stop being a bitch about it, I do x/y/z for you and you don’t do anything. No I won’t take 90% of my money back and replan the trip so we can go together, that’s insane!”"

You should have a real talk with her about this fact because I see a reasonable possibility that this is what is going on.  You're not the asshole for asserting your bodily autonomy.  She's not the asshole for having a disorder, if that is the case.

Have communication about this topic and try to understand.  The fact that she feels like you are punishing her for not allowing this does point towards trichotillomania as a possible explanation.  Additionally, trichotillomania has recently been classified as a form of OCD, and you brought up feeling like it's almost OCD.  She may have a mental disorder, and no one is an asshole.

Firstly, we have no clue about wether or not your friends are correct to be worried. Your defensiveness, if I’m being honest, has me suspecting that even if you don’t look like you’re knocking on deaths door that there is still disordered eating going on here. If you have lost a substantial amount of weight in a short period, react combatively at the concern of others, and people do not witness you eat, those with a backbone will begin to voice their fears. 

Anorexia kills more people than all anxiety and mood disorders combined, and is typically too late to prevent by the time loved ones grasp the severity.  If you are 0% engaged with an eating disorder and not at a high risk of developing one, that’s obviously great and the preferred situation. But right now your friends are not convinced. And I admire them for not being bystanders assuming someone else will voice their own thoughts.

What you said about your overweight friend was extremely rude and not in the same vein as your friends sentiments towards you. They were coming from a place of caring concern, whereas you just wanting them to stfu and leave you alone.



Edit: your comments clearly indicate an eating disorder. I’m sorry for what you’re going through. Anorexia alienates people from their friends, and that seems like exactly what’s going on here. With Anorexia you loose so much more than weight..wishing you a full recovery, sooner rather than later."

EDIT: To all the people saying something along the lines of ""but tires aren't fun,"" you are missing the point. I said ESH because the camera seems like a waste of money. However, he's still a much bigger asshole because he's acting like his wife isn't an equal partner in the relationship. I don't care that he said no camera, I care that he seems to think he should have 100% control of the family finances because he's the one working outside the home, and that's an asshole attitude.

Completely ignoring someone who is trying to talk to you is rude. If he's rambling on and on about irrelevant information, just shut the conversation down. Look up grey rocking.

If you're not happy, you have every right to leave. Especially in a case like this where you set up rules and standards of how to treat each other and he didn't hold up his side of the bargain. Even moreso if you're looking for someone to marry, because this is the type of problem that can worsen with time and strain/end a marriage, which I assume you don't want.

b1xw7g,"YTA. Not because you didn't ask for his permission (because it's not his to give; she has her own sexual agency), but because this was—by your admission—a recent breakup, and you had an expectation that Doug would be irritated, yet neglected to even tell him and created a climate of suspicion that convinced others not to tell him. He even said he wouldn't care, as long as you were forthcoming. But instead, he found out through a third party.

People make deep connections with their romantic partners that aren't immediately severed upon termination of a relationship. You should be well aware of this fact. Hiding it as you did suggests that you either knew it was outside of your group's social mores or that you didn't care what his reaction would be. Both conclusions point to you (1) doing something that you know would emotionally harm a friend; and (2) not caring that it would harm that friend; and then (3) leading others to follow in your footsteps with silence.

Again, this has nothing to do with the actual sex. Diane can make her own decisions, and Doug can't tell you you're not allowed to be intimate with her. It's the way you went about doing it surreptitiously that makes you the asshole. Next time you should respect your friends' emotional states and at least inform them that you're doing something you think they wouldn't like. You owe them that basic courtesy, especially if they ask you for it."

I was in a very similar situation, and looking back, I am so so upset with the shitty way I treated my friends. The most helpful thing people did, that was good for the both of us, was honestly let me know they couldn’t be my friend while I was in this relationship, but would be happy to love and support me when I got out. It was a lot nicer than just feeling abandoned or like they hated me, and having the clear message helped  me to reach out and apologize and rebuild the friendship after I escaped from the relationship.

b1z4w3,"NTA As I just said to someone else earlier with another ""mean joke"" post:

>""It's just a joke"" is the defense of a bully, not a comedian. A comedian will adjust their humor to actually be funny and apologize if a genuine joke didn't land. A bully will insist they did nothing wrong, and you're simply being glass-skinned. 

They didn't apologize at all. They shifted blame back onto you. ""You're too sensitive"" is a literal admission of assholery. It's someone saying, ""I don't feel like not being a dick, so you should suck it up because I care more about making fun of you than I care about your reaction to it.""

I don't know how you can resolve this except to be forceful and explain to them exactly why this all hurts so much and why you respect them less for it. If they're narcissists, they won't care about the explanation. If they're simply oblivious, it *might* work? But your admission of insecurity and mental trauma suggests that you won't even be able to approach them with the proper tone and wherewithal. Nevertheless, they're being rude and hostile on a daily basis to their own daughter, and it's not unreasonable at all for you to be fatigued by that. There's no such thing as ""overly sensitive"" when talking about jokes involving a loved one. If they were truly a loved one, you would simply *stop making the jokes*, because it would be more important to you that they feel loved than that you get to laugh *at* them (since they're clearly not laughing with you)."
b1z5bp,"Sorry, but YTA. 

From my experience people who are going through a rough time will take on projects to keep their mind at bay. Fixing up your house may be a way of him to find some peace with your family situation. Getting his mind off the family passings and improving the environment around himself is a good way of doing just that.

Your post strikes me as someone who is on the younger side, and may still have high expectations out of your parent. But you need to look at it from a broader perspective, this man has lost his mother and his wife within a year. That damage will take far longer than a year to meld.

Help him get back on his feet. Offer to hang the picture together. Companionship is valuable, especially if it is coming from his own child. The house will come together once he gets his life back together."

b1zlqg,"NAH. You haven’t cut her off yet, and just thinking thoughts doesn’t hurt anyone. It just helps you apply some logic to whatever your situation is. Your mom is a bit of a toss-up, but from your description she seems to be at least *trying* to be a good person. She’s been through hell, her first husband dying leaving her to care for all of her kids on her own, and then she gets stuck with an abusive husband. Actually cutting her off would be a much more complicated matter and would probably land you at least closer to the asshole category unless your mom pulled some crazy shit to deserve it. My suggestion would be to try to talk to her about improving both of your lives. You look for another job so you can help her out, she works on getting back to being the caring mother she was when her first husband was still around. Of course you know more than I do about the situation than I do, but that’s my input."

I get that you were worried about losing Hayley as a friend, but the immorality of what she did would’ve been a friendship dealbreaker for me. Hell, she even fooled around with Zach while you were *right there*. That’s awful and inappropriate in so many ways, even beyond the cheating. She sounds like a shitty friend just for that alone.

And even if Gary didn’t believe you, you still would’ve gotten this weight off your shoulders by handing off the baton, in a sense.
