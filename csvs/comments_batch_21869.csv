b27gpv,"YTA. You should always be careful when commenting on your co-workers appearance, especially when it is something that cannot be changed. By careful, I mean, avoid making any comments about it unless you know the person very well and they are a close friend and have established that such comments are welcomed.

Also, it is well known that height is an extremely sensitive issue for men. Saying that you forgot that a lot of short men are sensitive about it, would be the equivalent as commenting on a woman's weight and saying that you forgot that a lot of fat women are sensitive about it. "
b27igr,[deleted]
b27kcc,"NTA. Lots of reasons this is a greenlight: they no longer talk, you only dated for 2 months, and this sounds like it was awhile ago. The only thing I would caution is thinking that the first girls actions (cheating) negates any bad behavior you may do at some point. If someone is an asshole, being an asshole in an unrelated way down the road still makes you an asshole.

Bottom line, so long as it isn't just for spite, only your ex is TA. "
b27kij,Oof.
b27ljc,"NTA - you're never, ever the asshole for coming out, at any point. 

Your mother on the other hand trying to force/guilt you into being closeted is definitely on my shit lost."
b27rbq,NTA. Studying always comes before random kids that you're forced to hang around because of your family's mutual friendships.
b27xlb,"NTA for not wanting her to drive your car. She’s already proven herself to be an irresponsible driver, and her negligence could potentially ruin *your* car. It doesn’t matter that she’s your girlfriend; she’s reckless and can’t be trusted to keep the car—or herself/her passengers, for that matter—safe.

YTA for essentially leaving her without a ride though. Uber charges add up over the span of a week, so you could still pitch in and offer to drive her at least a few times."
b27z5f,YTA if you leave her.
b27zfu,"YTA

Don't let drunk people handle food you don't want to get eaten."
b282n6,YTA and BFF is TA. Stirring up conflict wasn’t a good move. You’ve pinned them against each other even more. And BFF needs to say her peace then either get on board to shut up. 
b28561,"NTA - Firstly, it was a fair 50/50 when you Both worked the same hours. It's nowhere near being an asshole to ask her to do a bit more.

Secondly - close that joint account, take your money and open your own account. If you and her want a joint account then deposit equal money. Everything should be split equal.

Lastly - you are in a relationship with her not her friends. It's not appropriate for them to be texting you and demanding you do things and callinhg you names.

I would really consider sitting her down explaining you work longer, contribute more and would like her to help out more. Judging by her reaction to this you should probably think about a new relationship. "
b285zg,"NTA

I'm an old dude, and I think it's a bit weird... I mean there are ways to come on to my wife that don't involve whipping it out. That said... You've been married 20 years, and you still inspire your man to want to yank it... Are you really sure that's something you want to get angry about?"
b2866n,"YTA. You know that sound carries in your house, and talking at 3:30am is going to annoy everyone who's in bed at that time, which is probably most of your roommates. What you all need to do is come to an agreement about what are the quiet hours, and then adhere to them. "
b286lq,"YTA, you want your boyfriend to argue with his own mother over something so small. You barely see his mother and what she says has no impact on your relationship.  You also gave him an ultimatum of ‘fight your mother or don’t see me today’."
b28caa,YTA they are just worried about your safety
b28ck1,"YTA. Of course you have time to speak to your girlfriend. If you don’t like her enough to even put her on loudspeaker perhaps, whilst you get something else done, spare her the misery and break it off"
b28egg,"YTA

It's a reasonable assumption that offering to pick up food meant you were offering to pay for it.

Have you ever offered to pay on a date? Have you ever even tried to reach for the check?"
b28ekz,NTA. It’s your hair. Your parents sound kinda like dicks
b28erm,"NAH. You’re absolutely entitled to feel protective over everything your Mom kept and interacted with, especially something like a phone that can keep photos and voice messages and other things of sentimental importance. 

But they don’t know how you feel about it, so they’re not assholes either. "
b28jxl,"NTA. If you were vegetarian, you wouldn't be expected to eat corned beef, would you? And you'd probably bring your own meal then, too. 

You have several options here: 

Send the soda bread and stay at home

Go, and bring your own food

Go, and just eat any side dishes that are available

Go, and bring a big side dish, and make that the basis for your meal (but check with SIL that it's okay to bring something extra for everyone)

Honestly, I'd just tell SIL you hate corned beef and cabbage, and you won't be eating it...what does she suggest you do? If she really takes hosting seriously, she should be kind enough to help you find a good solution. "
b28ktw,NTA. Jeff has some serious issues with social etiquette. 
b28q8i,"YTA, yes it’s your apartment but she’s within her rights to veto anyone not on the lease staying the night, especially if it’s a male and she shares the same personal beliefs. And one of your solutions is for her to leave her own home so some guests can stay the night without anyone who actually lives there being there. Just no."
b28qlo,"ESH. They should’ve communicated upfront about the planned activities and how much it’d cost. There should’ve been a total breakdown so if people couldn’t afford it or whatever the case may be, there was options. They also should’ve contacted you back when you messaged them saying your schedule changed. 

You also should’ve found out all the info before agreeing to go. At this point, since it’s after the fact, I think you pretty much just need to pay it. Though I would speak to the person who was in charge of all that, that it was kind of unfair. You’re all adults they should be able to handle it. And it’s complete shit that they involved the bride. "
b28uo0,"Going to be bluntly honest and get downvoted to hell for this but YTA ""trying to get through to her"" why is it any of your business? If you consider yourself a friend you wouldn't have tried to push her out of the group because she enjoys sex and you wouldn't have treated her this way. If you don't want to hear about it don't listen or walk away but don't try and change how someone lives their life. You are being super judgy and quite honestly judging a woman because she enjoys sex (which is obviously what this comes down to) is so 1900's it's disgusting"
b28uuv,NTA. He needs professional help. Tell his therapist or someone who can help him. 
b291j3,"YTA. You're meant to apologise because it's the right thing to do, not because you want something from the other person. "
b292k8,"NTA Stuff happens when you’re playing sports, everyone that joins in should be willing to accept the risk. "
b294gk,"YTA. Sometimes we have to apologize even when we don't feel like it. Just because that's the nice thing to do. 

In this case, you were TA. First, you could have watched your videos with headphones so as not to disturb your parents. That might have helped to avoid this whole situation since they wouldn't have been annoyed by what you were watching. 

Then, your stepdad drank a beer. That's a far way off from being drunk. It was totally out of line for you to insult him and tell him he stinks. 

Just get over yourself and apologize. "
b294lq,"YTA-

This person probably does know their limits, but they probably also didn’t want to miss out on an opportunity. You’re suggesting people with anxiety just... never try? Never step outside their comfort zone? Just resign to the fact that they’re anxious and will never do anything more?

Your reaction should be that they are brave to try, and should be proud to have made it a week. Your reaction shouldn’t be that it’s *wasted*, but that this person expanded their comfort zone, even a little, and that hopefully the next time they try something they’re a little more successful. "
b29gwh,"YTA You have other people to talk to. His mother was an inappropriate choice.

Also the fact is he wants to get you into an even better financial situation and get to a place in his career where he doesn't have to stress. It's hard af having a child and trying to further you're career.

Lay off him, you're married and have time and for goodness sake don't talk to his family about inconsequential stuff like this. "
b29i7w,"NTA

If half the class is actually failing or in fear of failing that sounds more like a teacher problem than an academic issue.   I had a biology teacher where nearly the entire class failed and he was fired because the school just couldn't believe so many students could fail who were doing so well academically in other subjects."
b29kc6,NTA - but I will throw out another possibility: she tried to complain to everyone about how inconsiderate you were and they all told her that you had a point.
b29l9x,"NTA. You're polite, maybe even a little *too* polite, and your granny doesn't seem to understand bounderies."
b29lr8,"Did you remember that it was his birthday when you reserved the date? Yeah it sucks that he’s hung up on you but if you knowingly set the date at the same time knowing you have a similar friend group than that would make you a bit of an asshole. Otherwise, it’s an honest mistake."
b29os0,"Nta, your sister is in very very deep shit, but whatever you do, the abandonment is the only thing that guarantee that she is never coming back to you, I understand why you want to cut ties, and you are in your right to do so, but that self destructiveness cut ties with the world quicker than any other bullshit anyone can do, I'm not saying that you save your sister from herself, but consider in a more loving way not to cut ties."
b29rhr,"I'm not going to rule here as no drama has occurred yet.  If you value this friendship it is better not to have sex with this guy, but it is not really clear if you do since you recently went a year without talking or trying to reconcile"
b29rsb,"If you apologized because you wanted closure, then you absolutely apologized to make yourself feel better. I don't necessarily think that makes you an asshole, but you need to leave the past in the past. You're only hurting other people by stirring everything back up."
b29sim,YTA. Replace things your kid destroyed even if you don't like the person. You don't have to like them to do the right thing.
b29w8f,NTA. How dare they search your luggage? How dare he eat what he must have assumed was food? Did he try on your underwear too?
b29x32,NTA. You were reasonable. You had an agreement. It’s been breached. She owes you 200 bucks. That’s her problem.  Not yours. 
b29yxp,"Nta. Sounds like you made the right choice

He is a piece of shit who when he didn’t get what he wanted started smearing you. He doesn’t deserve your attention on any level. 

If you have copies of all the texts/messages then i would save them and report him to the school for harassing you. "
b2a1md,"NTA. He’s too young to even be on social media, in my opinion. My 13 year old nephew has a Facebook and his friend request has been sitting in Friend Request purgatory for 6 months because he’s 13 and I have a feeling he’ll act the same way as your cousin and I don’t want to have anything to do with it. The difference in level of maturity even between 13/14 and 18 is astronomical, and I’m 29. No way do I want a 13 year old to follow me on Facebook, even if it is my nephew. "
b2a6b0,NTA at all. You deserve to be paid for your time.
b2afpr,NTA. No animals mean no animals. Tough shit for them
b2ahib,NTA: sounds like he’s one of those “nice guys”. There are compliments and then there is flirting. He can’t seem to be friends with someone of the girls without undertones of sex being involved in the conversation. Best to cut ties. 
b2ahig,"NTA. You two agreed to trade, it's not like you stole it from her."
b2aht9,"NTA

Do it.

You can even come clean depending on if they confess or not, and come across as the big, stern, parent figure, forgiving them for the first scandalous lie, but not to let it happen again.  You can't afford any other dogs after this one.

Or, tell her you'll take all her dogs, but she has to pay a boarding fee."
b2ajnj,NTA. It's inappropriate to have a male friend while he can have female friends. Op you need to consider this relationship. 
b2akdj,"I will add that he’s forgetting that he was laughing at me in Burger King and I cried. And yes, I’m still pissed. We normally don’t do gifts and the time I give him something and he laughs at me. 
.
.
Even though he was a dick. I still love him and have been with him for 6 years now. We just don’t do gifts anymore. "
b2alrk,NTA. He didnt keep his word.
b2aopv,[deleted]
b2apr1,"NTA, he was abusive to you. Think you need to have a chat with your mother about why she tolerated you being abused by that monster."
b2arjb,"NTA. This is your dream vacation, and you’ve already offered to bring your SO along, but she refused. If you have the money and the time, there’s not much she can do to stop you."
b2arpx,NTA I hate people like that.
b2as47,"NTA. 
Something about being an older sibling sucks when it comes to stuff like this. Im constantly having to pick up my younger brothers/ pick up dinner etc. Because of this I couldnt take an after school advanced english course 2x a week that I really wanted to take. You shouldnt have to parent your siblings and your parents should know to carve out time for you. I love my siblings but damn it sucks sometimes. 

In the end, you’ll be at college in a year and free from them holding you back. Try to hold on and learn as much as you can. Its a big decision and you deserve the time to see if its the right one for you. "
b2asxk,"NTA, the whole situation seems odd. Like either information is missing or they're unstable. Why would kind people help you out and not expect money, then expect money then demand it, then spread untrue runors. I'd say ignore their crazy and pay it forward in the future. Glad your in a better place now. "
b2aug0,[deleted]
b2ayk3,"NTA 
sometimes friendships are toxic and run there course. It’s ok too miss her , just don’t go back. It’s a hard lesson to learn and it’s hard letting go of a friend but no one needs that in their life. "
b2b17h,"NTA

If she was willing to cover the difference (ie, if she paid more because she makes more money), and you felt OK with that, I would say maybe consider moving. But if she wants to split 50/50 and that leaves you with nothing, you really *can't* move. "
b2b1by,"NTA - it is rude to ask a child if they want something after the caregiver has already said no.  Coming around a second time was uncalled for.  I have been to chuck e. cheese numerous times and I have never seen anyone walking around selling anything.  Besides, the child could have health issues and may not be able to eat it."
b2b1cb,Giving up some time at dinner to get off Facebook and play cards with your kid should not be a chore. Mom sounds like a total bitch to me. 
b2b2ja,"YTA This isn't yet a long-term thing. She doesn't owe you a duty as a girlfriend to prioritize time with you. She was spending time with a friend, and being pissed about that is unbecoming. She could have afforded a text message earlier to tell you that she was spending more time than she had planned, but the act of spending the time itself is not something you should be angry about."
b2b4ys,[deleted]
b2b5f7,NTA — you would be an asshole if you didn’t call CPS. That child needs better than sleeping in the dirt. 
b2b9dr,"NTA

If you're not comfortable around your step-father, you don't want to live with him.  It isn't going to go well.

You are an adult and get to choose where you live.  If other people get upset over it, it is their problem."
b2bbp6,"NTA

Hes in jail for beating up his wife? Fine. Fuck him, he can stay in jail. Bailing him out would be tantamount to condoning his actions. "
b2bgwz,"NTA

You tried. Some relationships (even platonic) are just not meant to be..."
b2bhn4,"NTA, but you sounded like an asshole to them.

I'd learn how to be more tactful about the way you get such high marks. Try to be polite and lift people up. Next time someone says ""I can't believe you did so well without doing work"", give them a BIG, *GENUINE* smile (this is really important), and say ""I actually do work really hard! You just don't really see it cause it's usually behind-the-scenes. If you want, I could totally give you some pointers on how to study for these kinds of things!"" The last sentence is optional, but its your call.

Other than that, high schoolers are gonna high school. You guys are still young, and quick to jump to conclusions. It might be that that person was trying to start drama with you or something petty/childish like that. The only way to react and deal with that is by being completely genuine and/or avoiding it altogether. 

In 5 years, everyone will have forgotten about you, and you will have forgotten about everyone."
b2bkr7,"NTA but don't say it like that. I mean you can be honest and say something like, I need to take some me time and not be social. If she really presses farther than decide whether you want to expand more but to start just say you need some space for a few days. "
b2bo18,"YWBTA. If she is forced to do it, don’t make a scene by not participating. Be a supportive brother and bite the bullet with her."
b2bob8,Well she’s definitely going to make the same threat if you don’t invite her to the big wedding
b2bobx,"NAH

You were just a bit more forward than she was comfortable with, nobody is at fault for the awkward moment"
b2bqx9,"ESH hes dismissing your ideas and youre being demanding. just because you dont like it doesnt mean he doesnt like it either. Maybe see if you can pick a room or two that you can have as yours to decorate and he can have his to decorate as he pleases that way you both can compromise and still have it feel like a home to both of you, not just one or the other. "
b2bsqc,NTA. She’s pregnant. She should know better than to smoke. If she wants them that bad she can get them herself.
b2by2c,"NTA - You're not responsible for ruining her life, she is. Maybe this will be a wake up call and she'll get her shit together."
b2c11n,"NTA, this sort of stuff may not be super easy for your dad to understand but consider talking about other options like homebound schooling (temporary leave from school with help from teachers) or maybe see if they have any half day programs, I’ve been in this situation and it’s hard to ask for this sort of thing but if you’re struggling this much it doesn’t make you an asshole to ask for time off as long as you think it’ll actually help you and perhaps ask your dad to talk to your school counselor if you don’t want to yourself. "
b2c2h4,"She'll take violent revenge on you.

Nah it just seems like helping your sister with mario would be a nice thing to remember"
b2c592,NTA. If he needed you until 5 he should have scheduled you until 5.
b2c6gn,"NTA.  Your account, your choice.  You are not morally obligated to give access to your friends.  If someone wants it that bad, they can get it themselves."
b2c73i,"NTA

She shouldn't have done that. Do your duty and pay your child support, but I wouldn't stay in a relationship with her. "
b2c9ak,"NTA, but I understand people not knowing what was going on and getting annoyed. Too many people on planes act like they’re the only thing that matters, so it makes it tough to be as generous with good will and trust that people aren’t being assholes."
b2c9g3,NTA - kids have to learn and coddling isn't always the answer. 
b2c9hx,SHP
b2cdox,"NTA. Her BPD explains her behavior but it doesn't excuse it. I understand that it can be a trigger for her but sometimes last minute cancellations are inevitable. She'll have to learn coping mechanisms. However, that has nothing to do with you who is *pregnant* and *nauseous*. "
b2cdrp,"NTA. My mom was the same way when I was learning to drive. 

Fortunately, she was the one who thought it best if she didn’t teach me / drive with me. I took lessons with the local AAA instead."
b2cepb,"Ah, well he’s just a moron then."
b2cg9v,"NTA.

When other people realize, you have an issue. I would simply the all him that it's quickly spiraling from a work friend to unprofessional. People are seeing you guys together and starting to talk. Couples in the work place need to play by stricter rules."
b2cjkl,"YTA

DON'T EVER talk about private sex stuff with your friends without the clear OK from your SO. It's a serious breach of privacy and trust. "
b2cjwn,"NTA your SIL sounds horrible. She is entitled. I'm not going to say that adults shouldn't celebrate that way because everyone deserves some fun and excitement but the way she demands it and doesn't plan it herself is horrible. 

For now, just do it for your wife. But I sincerely hope your wife stops appeasing her"
b2cl1k,"YTA albeit a tiny asshole, because in reality, this isn't really AITA worthy IMO, since it's such a tiny conflict. Anyways, there are better ways to go about expressing your feelings towards Therese without calling her names."
b2ctpi,"YTA for cheating on him.  

 You aren't an asshole for breaking up with him.  Your goals in life are not compatible.  So don't string him along.  Move home.  Transition into a professional relationship at work.  Live your life."
b2cuco,"NTA if his radio silence is truly out of nowhere. But blowing up his phone will not lead to anything good. 

Ghosting is disrespectful, but harassing someone over the phone is too. 

Stop calling and texting him. If he ever gets back to you, handle it then and there. If he never does, accept he dumped you and move on. Not a lot more you can do right now. "
b2cv3h,"Esh-
So she can cheat with you and you're not morally opposed to that, but suddenly now that she wants a relationship, it's not cool? She sucks for cheating, you suck for suddenly not wanting to be with her when you're the one she cheated with. "
b2cwin,NTA. I totally agree with you. He could have browsed fb while waiting outside the grocery store for you. Or declined your request and stayed at home. 
b2cy0j,"ESH

He for obvious reasons including asking about drugs, following you and just being annoying. You for assuming that things you do should be standard and everyone should do them. Some people look up different things when they move. It is possible the main things he looked up just had to do with Tokyo or maybe he got transferred to work quickly or a ton of other things. 

While I understand you being annoyed and you had no need to engage him in conversation, how you went about it wasn't great."
b2czio,"NTA but dude...
>she seems a lot more mature and understanding and I'm assuming shes changed for the better

>she literally doesn't tell *anyone* shes with me. She hides me from her friends, family, and etc.

>She says that she doesn't want to make it ""official"" because its too much stress on her.

She's doesn't sound more mature OR understanding. She sounds like she's a 15-year-old in high school. I see no change at all."
b2d0z5,"vaping = dangerous person to you?

I think you need to get out more."
b2d288,"NTA, but please learn how to say no.  This guy is definitely over the top, but you don't owe him anything. If you try talking to him again (even to let him down) he's just going to take it as a sign that you have feelings for him.  Keep him blocked."
b2d40j,"NTA. How else can they expect you to communicate your grievances without direct insubordination, yelling, etc? It’s only the cold shoulder. You’re responding to point-blank questions, even willing to say I love you. 


"
b2d9pe,"NTA

Rude on his part. He could have asked what kinds you had instead of touching every single one. "
b2da5j,NTA you were just asking him to be open to ensure accurate treatment. that's no reason to get shit on.
b2daf1,"Don't lie to your wife, YTA."
b2dfqj,"honestly the touching and not respecting boundaries thing is grossing me out.
that is not okay from him"
b2dfta,"NTA.

Used to live in a dormitory. Shared laundry facilities. It was pretty commonly accepted that you leave your washing basket by the machine otherwise your clothes are getting left on a dirty bench. Moving the clothes into an empty dryer seems like a more than fine compromise."
b2dg2c,NTA . The dog deserves better than being locked in an apartment all day with only a few hours of human connection 
b2dj00,"YTA. His mother is the one allowing the family friend to stay over, he has no say of the matter. Why would you get mad at him over something that isn't in his control? That's really poor reasoning on your part.  Also, after several years you should trust him more and this wouldn't be an issue. "
b2dkiq,"NTA - inviting yourself over is rude by itself, but this is an enormous imposition. She's literally asking you to put your life on hold, spend money you don't have, etc. etc. with no prior discussion. She's completely boundary stomping, and you need to push back hard or this *will* happen again."
b2dmfp,"YTA and being very petty. They are not stealing your cat from you. They are feeding a cat they originally thought was a stray as well as another one. Unless you keep your cat indoors or on your own property, you have no right to get angry at them."
b2dmkx,"NTA; Your mother is giving her a free pass and wants you to too.

""Mom, I do treat them equally, the one who treats me nicely, I treat her nicely, the one who treats me like shit, I distance myself from, actually, thats better than treating her equally, because I could be as shitty to her as she is to me.""

Or,

""Mom, have you ever had a talk with Molly about how she treats people? Why are you having one with me, when I don't treat people the terrible way she treats everyone? Is that you treating us equally?"""
b2dns5,"PLEASE call CPS 

NTA.  That is exactly the kind of thing you should call CPS about "
b2dssb,"YTA, for the only reason is that lying over a small thing and not coming clean within a reasonable time frame, gives him reason not to believe you about something else in the future. It breeds distrust."
b2dutf,"NTA. You don't HAVE to be anyone's friend. It's nice that you defend him, but the fact that you feel he's been forced into your life tells you everything you need to know. You shouldn't be his friend out of pity. If you want to be friends with him, great, if not, it's fine to try to minimize contact a little bit to preserve your own sanity."
b2dwpw,"NTA 

Wow...just wow. I fully understand why you don't want her around your son. That kind of behavior will only get worse. Keep standing your ground. Either the woman will adapt or she will bottom out and ruin the support of everyone around her. "
b2dy52,"YTA for not giving them a chance to wake up and get some caffeine and clean up after themselves but judging them harshly for the cleaning you chose to do. If they told you they expected you to clean up after everyone's party every morning, they'd be TA. They didn't do that and you didn't even give them a chance to clean up while sober or speak to them about it, just cleaned and got righteous and judgy."
b2e51h,"NTA. You can dislike almost anyone for almost any reason and not be an asshole.

You don’t owe this woman kindness, nor a relationship, just because she’s your blood.

Be cordial if you’re in her presence, but you owe her nothing else."
b2eaiw,"NTA - good god, it would have been insensitive for him to say that to you privately, let alone yelling across a crowded room. You’re 200% NTA, OP, and what he did was hurtful as hell. "
b2eati,"YWBTA - he has to deal with 300+ of you and I am pretty sure there are a fair number of people that make regular excuses about things like this. This is probably the root cause of his tone.

If this is genuinely an error on their end, there is nothing wrong with you asking for it to be checked regardless of what his opinion is regarding computers that can supposedly never make a mistake. Standing up for yourself and for your grades, where warranted, won't make you an asshole. But responding to him in a less than respectful way just because you perceive him as being sarcastic is not the way to go, he can make your life a living hell if he wants to."
b2ebpn,"NAH. she's just being young, but you're right to look after her and try steer her the right way"
b2ecqn,"NTA this is silly - any adult should know to lock the door when using the restroom. Honestly, I wouldn't even go by the light rule if it wasn't an issue. Lights get left on sometimes, even in households that are good about it. If they don't lock the door when using a communal bathroom, they're *going* to get walked in on, end of discussion."
b2eeux,"ESH - obviously the TV is not worth 1200, and she also should have asked for it back sooner than 4 months later. But you really should have at least offered to give it back before selling it."
b2egqz,"NTA. You asked him to delete it and he didn't. Dick move on his part, considering its a private group"
b2eh63,YTA. lol. My grandparents died.
b2ei4u,"NTA. 4/6 people didn't really make an effort to go to your party for your birthday. I think you should still tell Mae the truth and why you said it was cancelled though. And for sure, keep the 2 friend that showed up around since they made the effort to be there"
b2eifq,"NTA

I would be devastated losing hours with my kids everyday because my ex decided to move further away , and all that knowing I just moved myself to be closer, too."
b2emwr,"NTA for breaking up with him if you realize you aren't on the same page feelings wise,  but definitely YTA for considering keeping him around while you date other people and figure it out"
b2eqdr,"NTA if you tell him privately. 

Just don’t embarrass him needlessly and you’re golden. "
b2es0m,"NAH, sometimes you just don't like a person, as long as it's all internal you're fine."
b2es4t,YTA. Don't make things difficult. These are regular childhood problems parents deal with. 
b2esbr,"NTA because you had no ill intent. Ask your friend why what you said bothered them, and that you genuinely want to know."
b2ett3,"NAH, I didn't cry when my grandpa died because he treated me and my brother like shit until he was terminal, we both visited him a couple times before he passed just so he could have closure but neither one of us felt much when he passed.

b2fh47,"NTA. Who brings home 2 cats without clearing it with their SO?!

Even a roommate could be justified in fighting with her over this action."
b2fk0g,"NTA

My sister and I once had a huge argument because she was upset I never offered to babysit her kids, and I explained to her (well, yelled at her) that I had chosen not to have kids for a reason, and her decision to have kids didn’t override my choice not to want to spend my free time taking care of kids. I love her kids, I will happily give them all the attention in the world when I visit them, but I don’t want to have responsibility for caring for them for hours on end. 

While it’s great if you want to and can babysit for her, you are not responsible for her kids, having kids and knowing they would need constant care was her choice, not yours."
b2fk9u,"YTA. What are you, 40-something? And you're still unable to have an adult conversation with your partner. Stop acting like you're in high school and just tell him. Even if he doesn't find out, it's clearly making you feel guilty, and that's not healthy. Just tell him. It's not like you cheated on him with James. "
b2fngf,NTA the other guy is the obviously the asshole he should have never killed 49 people.
b2fp5s,"YTA. 

My fucking god you’re petty. Grow up."
b2fqw9,NTA. Sounds like you’ve done what you could. His behaviour may be linked to his service but you can only do so much to manage that

EDIT: to say, what was it that made you think you could possibly be the asshole? "
b2ftzm,"NAH-

While your parents are right, it probably did come off as rude... what did they expect you to do? Choke down too salty food? It’s probably for the best that they told you, now you can learn from your mistake and only take small portions in the future. You can always go back for more! "

b2g49y,"YTA. If you're in college, you should know that it's not okay for you to say that, even if you were just singing along. Your roommate tells you he's not okay with you saying it (a perfectly reasonable reaction) and you say ""but I didnt mean it to be insulting!""

And anyways, who the hell lies about something as trivial as a lunch date? Someone hiding something."
b2gan3,"NTA.  If she's not going to do her own assignments, she can't complain when it's not done to her satisfaction.  Also, stop doing her assignments for her.  It's *her* education, not yours.  And if you get caught, it's not going to go well for you.

b2gmxl,YTA. I'd probably think you were cheating too. You seem to have zero respect for your SO's boundaries with regard to this guy. You went and took risque pictures with a guy you know your SO is uncomfortable with? What did you think would happen? I don't think you're stupid so it looks like you don't care about hurting your guy. Enough has gone on here that I don't think it was unreasonable for your SO to not want this friend around. It's on you that it got this far. 
b2gnto,"NTA - or you wouldn't be the asshole.

It is the safest, and smartest move, to keep far away. Getting involved will just potentially get you caught up in everything, disciplinary action, that kind of thing.

Stay far away. If she wants to dig her own grave then let her. "
b2gpgu,"NTA-

You don’t owe anyone friendship, or need a reason to cut people off. They seemed rude, and you’re probably better off. "
b2gryv,"NTA-

Stop being complicit with racism. When people show you their true colors and prove they are racist, cut them off. "
b2h3sc,"NAH I think, but you probably can't expect them to do this if they need to be available for work.  I never feel/hear my phone when it's on vibrate, so if they need to be available then this is something that you unfortunately may just have to deal with.  You can certainly ask but I don't think you can push it if they say no.

Incidentally my personal phone is always on silent (no vibration).  It's much nicer checking it when I feel like it, not when it buzzes or rings or whatever. "
b2h5z3,NTA. You don’t owe him anything just because he’s dying. 
b2hcbj,"NTA your friends are totally just using your place as a sesh hole they don't respect it now, probably never did amd probably never will.

Stand up for yourself to your friends with there responses tell them you're happy for them to not come over again and you look forward to having these gatherings and one of there houses "
b2hf3g,"NTA, but I would have a serious conversation with said friend about this. Atm your life is draining and exhausting, and they're wearing you down even more. I get the feeling they don't know why you don't want to hang out as often? Need some info here. 

I'd feel sorry for breaking up with a friend I've known for a decade - there's something solid in there. Perhaps from their point of view, hanging out with the two of you is a good time for both of you, and they're disappointed when you ""deny"" them that. 

is this the kind of friend you never want to see again, or the kind of friend you want to keep around but your current situation is making it difficult? Sometimes it's hard to have a clear answer for this when you're so tired =/ "

b2hmjo,NTA She's your ex. Not your responsibility anymore
b2hojv,"NTA. 

I think if your father needed physical help it would be difficult to put that on her. I am concerned about her mental health given hoarding of her own and clearly not acknowledging that problem despite having you help her cleaning up.

Would it be reasonable for her to stay at your house for the period of time?"
b2hr8o,"YTA

You went to bed early, which was your choice, he went to bed at a late but not unreasonable hour. So it was inconsiderate but not assholey move for him to continue on with his normal evening activities.

You then got up and made noise at an unreasonable hour. That is an asshole move."
b2hszb,"NTA. If you have received various complaints 3 weeks into your job, it does suggest some liability on your part as far as being an asshole goes. But based on what you have explained, she's the asshole here.

b2hyws,NTA - There is no reason why she cannot wash out the microwave after using it. That usually gets rid of any smells.
b2i236,"NTA , you are there to make sure people follow the rules and seems you didn't said it in an offensive manner. The father overreacted, I wish he'd discipline his son with the same enthusiasm.

That said, you should always take into account this kind of parents exist, watch for yourself and avoid saying things that can get you unnecessarily in trouble. "
b2i2wp,"NAH, you weren't trying to cause harm and it's understandable why she'd overreact to what you said. If both of you are reasonable about it, then it shouldn't be too hard to work things out."

Sucks, but you're putting in the work, and what it is that you're getting back?

I mean, if you're doing it just to help the buddy, cool! But you've made it clear that you want in, and he literally took it from you. Just be CLEAR from now on, whenever one of these deals pop up that ""this one is mine"". Be assertive. Sometimes he may not even realize he's being an asshole."
b2ij5u,"NTA. Growing up my parents were very strict as well. They also regulated what I could watch on TV and they were the type to want copious amount of information about my friends and their parents before even considering whether or not I could go over there house. All that being said, strict parents make sneaky children. Yes there is a lot of content in the interwebs that is not appropriate and whatnot but making your child feel like they are untrustworthy kinda defeats the whole purpose. If your parents are anything like mine, I’m sure they are just doing what they think is best and operating out of love. Talking with them about their strict rules may or may not help, but bear with it and use their rules as motivation to get out and get your own place when you can. "
b2ilju,"NTA. He was blowing up because he was caught red handed, and tried to deflect. If it would have been a genuine confusion, he'd just have said ""Oh, sorry mate!"" and moved on."

b2itko,NAH as long as you approach it the right way. 
b2j231,"YTA. Look, I’ve been there— busted my ass to get something in on time only to have the teacher extend the deadline. But a teacher showing compassion for struggling students is not an opportunity for you to get above-and-beyond points for doing what was expected of you. The reality is that you are not privy to the details of why the deadline was extended, and asking for bonus marks seems like you’re putting other students’ struggles and your own on the same level when you don’t actually know if that’s the case. 

I’m going to give you some advice that’s been given to me in the same situation: don’t get frustrated at things like this that are out of your control. Don’t see that period of busting your ass to get this done as “wasted” stress— see it as unknowingly putting yourself ahead of the game. Use the extra days to polish up your project, or just sit back and be content that your work is already done. "
b2j33l,"NAH - it makes sense that she’s insecure (read: young) and nervous about you being gone for that long. 

But honestly you should not pass up this opportunity for a relationship that may very well not graduate with you.

If he’s an abusive guy there’s no reason you need to let him be in the delivery room. I’m so sorry you’re in the position of having to make these decisions.

Why don’t you take up some of the responsibility around the house to lighten her load. You have every evening you aren’t working available to do some of that work which your wife, who works as a nurse, does anyway.

b2kmd6,"NTA.

Listen, you’re the DM and seen as the figure of authority in your group, but that certainly isn’t the same as a teacher in a classroom — it is not your job to mediate the social dynamic of the group. They are adults and if Holly has a problem with the way Will and Lorraine are dressed, that should be their discussion. I see how Holly could want to go to you as the DM, since you get to make the rules of the game, but this is certainly something that you can take a step back from and say, “Not my place to monitor other people’s clothing.”

I would ever go on to say it would be one thing if you’re recording/streaming the DnD sessions, but I’m assuming you aren’t, so it’s not like anyone else is seeing the players and commenting on appearance."

Wow thanks for all the upvotes everyone. This is the first post I’ve had with more than a response or two definitely wasn’t expecting it."
b2kqs4,"YTA...why have friends that you can't be honest with? Is that even friendship? 

Real friendship means being able to say to a mate that their hygiene is gross and their arrogance is offputting to others. You don't have to be mean when you say it, but you aren't really a friend if you can't say it and instead are sneaking around behind their back and telling others things you don't have the courage to say to them. "
b2kqwb,"NTA. It's a really unfair burden to put on you to expect you just deal with someone threatening self-harm (or possibly already in engaging in it as far as you could tell) because inpatient care sucks.

b2lgw1," Imo, YTA.  His age is not an excuse for being rude and he was very rude (not to mention racist and sexist). Why is it any of his business how she wears her hair or what colour she is? You would have been right to tell him to get some manners.

b2n3jn,YTA. that's the kind of thing someone else says to you or you say to yourself in the mirror. Saying it at a celebration is being an ass. Like congratulating yourself. You're meant to let others do that. Congrats on the promotion though! :) 
b2n45o,"NTA - personally I think this line of thinking is dumb, but its exceptionally common (in men and women, this isn't really a sexism thing). And it was really shady of them to not tell you before had. A lot of people wouldn't be comfortable with their partners ex fuckbuddies around. "
b2n4am,"NTA

He's clearly taking advantage and using you as his personal ATM."
b2n4mx,"NTA, but I wouldn’t get involved again. This seems to be out of your control sadly. Just support her and reassure her as much as you can. "
b2n5qd,"YTA.  You mention your brother lives in a shithole and your sister is married to a multimillionaire? It sounds like you resent them both, for different reasons, regardless of what it going on now.  In either case, it isnt their responsibility to care for your mother (nor is it yours) just like it isn't their fault your wife and daughter have health issues. You all have your own lives and how you spend your time is up to the each of you. You chose to help your mom, that's great, but that doesn't mean you have to make yourself into the martyr."

b2ngr8,NTA. He sounds like an asshole.
b2nhuf,"NTA - Obviously best thing for this guy is therapy, but seeing as how he doesn't want to, next best thing is a good old fashioned wake up call. If enough people tell him, he might actually listen. You did him a favour."
b2niae,"NTA. Old people aren't children, they don't need to be protected from harsh realities. She has had a lifetime to realize her opinion is extremely hateful and homophobic, and she shouldn't be surprised when someone lets her know that.

b2njyu,"NAH have the conversation, you guys need to be able to talk about finances, it is part of being in a relationship. What is the difference in rent between a 1 bedroom and a 2 bedroom? You said that he was hoping for 50/50 because he still had court expenses etc...to deal with, would he expect to kick down a bit more when that is over? Will it ever be over? If you go 50/50 for rent would he pay more of the other expenses (utilities, food) when he is able?? What do each of you consider to be shared expenses vs individual expenses? All of these kinds of scenarios should be talked through and then you guys come up with a plan that works for you"
b2nocn,"YTA. Let me get this straight, you were on the rebound and took this woman home and fucked her, but you aren't attracted to her? 

WTF, you suck."
b2nq6e,YTA. You didn’t need to bring race into it. Really unnecessary. 
b2nt21,"NAH, but if you do this, it's going to really hurt your relationship with your wife.  I think you both have good points, can you find a compromise?  Like she can do it but if grades slip then dye it back immediately? "
b2nvx8,"YTA. While I 100% agree with what you said about how he shouldn't go to jail (assuming you're correct there's no evidence), you picked exactly the wrong time to say it. If he assaulted her, it's pretty fucked up to tell her you don't think her assaulter should get consequences exactly when she's going through a traumatic time. It would be like walking into a funeral and telling the family there is no God. You may think it, and you may be right, but the context makes you an asshole. 

"
b2nxft,YTA- no one does this. Ever. Unload your stuff on the conveyor belt and put the basket in the designated spot under the belt where everyone else puts it. I’m guessing you’re an adult and if so how have you not learned this?
b2nztg,"YTA.

From his perspective, he did propose. Doesnt matter if he gives you a diamond ring or gummy bears, public or not. From what I can tell, you didn't oppose at the time, and took it as a cute inside joke. But to wait 7 months before telling him you're not actually engaged is harsh.

If you don't want to get married at your age that's completely fine, but people can get married as early as 16, and sometimes even younger depending on the state."

Your father is toxic and abusive, both emotionally and physically. For the sake of your child and your own well-being, I would distance yourself."
b2o5za,"NTA.  It’s unfortunate that he’s in pain,  but he shouldn’t take it out on you. I have chronic pain and it sucks, but I can choose how to respond-most of the time, anyway.  So can he. When I find myself getting testy, I go have some quiet time alone. You don’t have to be bending over backwards to cater to him. I’ll bet his Mom will do that! Give yourself a break, you have to take care of yourself.  Also, men have a lower pain tolerance and can be wimps."

b2o85p,"Yes, YWBTA.

It's not your problem nor is it your business to snitch on her child"
b2oarv,"NAH, you're all allowed to want what you want. But I don't see this ever going well. Most monogamous people would (myself included) consider polygamy cheating, and desire a commitment. It's often a point of pride, that they're ""good enough"" for somebody to commit to them.
"
b2oc9p,"NAH You broke up, I honestly think it's an unreasonable expectation for you to continue the lease living with each other.  Check the lease paperwork for how much notice is needed. Maybe 30 days?  If you break the lease you will both likely take a loss on the security deposit.  Alternatively, you could sublet for the remainder of the lease.  I also recently worked out with my apartment to swap the co-tennant on my lease.  You have options.  Talk to management, talk to her.

someone can eat meat and still think dog fighting is wrong. not everything is 0% or 100% extreme"
b2omsy,"NAH - It makes sense. He’s a grown-ass person who should be responsible. But it sounds like he wasn’t really raised with the expectation of contributing to the household chores or was nagged relentlessly into doing them so his inability to be self starting in this regard makes some sense too. 

It may take some time (because it did with me and my wife) but just keep setting the expectation and making sure (even though you shouldn’t have to) you let him know you appreciate it when he does these things on his own. It will reinforce the idea that he should be doing them and that there is a positive impact from his actions. "
b2on6m,"As someone who is getting into tattoos and piercings, please PLEASE tell people if there's someone in the industry to avoid!! Body modifications are so important and personal, often staying on your body for a lifetime. If someone is out there giving wonky piercings, call them out!"

b2opuz,"NTA. 

It's completely on him and him only to decide to get his stuff together and work hard. It's hard being a good student, toy shouldn't be spending your time explaining things to someone who isn't worth it. 

Next time he asks, tell him straight up to pay attention. "
b2ovjl,"NTA

While I don’t think breaking up is how far you need to go, I’d understand it because that’s gross and at the end of the day it’s your relationship, not mine. There’s pranks and then there’s that, which is straight up disgusting"
b2ovsq,NTA everyone deserves privacy.
b2owxw,"NTA

Those spots are reserved for a reason. And if he works there he probably leaves the car there all day. Someone who actually needs the spot may be unable to get it. Hopefully a ticket gets him to change his behavior."
b2ozdr,NAH. PROVIDED! that you are polite about it and you go into it with the understanding that he might not be willing to part on that one. be polite be honest you good.
b2ozu3,"YTA if you do this in the way you're suggesting, without a prior discussion and especially on the spurious excuse that there ""aren't enough groomsmen"". 

I think it is reasonable to remove them as bridesmaids, but only after an honest discussion about the state of your friendship, and where it's going, and what it means to all of you. It might be that they also feel like it's drifting, and they're ok with that - it might be that it's the kick up the arse they need to get their relationships into gear.

After that, you'll be better placed to make a decision about bridesmaids - and they will be better-placed to understand it. Be aware that you could really, really put people offside by removing them as bridesmaids - it's a **very** public statement to the six of you - so it's far easier if it's a decision that everyone can accept.

Don't be dishonest and make up some crap about the groomsmen. Everyone will see through it immediately, especially given that you've had three years to get enough groomsmen together. "

b2pbt8,NTA. Your teacher definitely is though.
b2pemq,"NTA. I was going to say everyone sucks until you told him you didn't want to hear it and he kept going.  That's like rule #1 of serving, do what you can to keep the table happy. And if that means shutting your mouth, it should've been an easy win.
I'm more surprised he would even bring up politics at all."
b2pi6u,"NAH. It's totally your choice to not hug people, but if you're the only person avoiding a hug then you can't really blame people for taking it the wrong way. Maybe next time say something about not being a hugger ahead of time or, if you'd rather tolerate it, just do a quick side hug or something to make it easier."
b2pitu,"NTA. You did the right thing. When that person is doing shitty things, they don't deserve your trust. You would have been fucking HER over if you hadn't been honest with her. Let her make an informed decision. Good job, I'm proud of the action you took. "
b2pj6e,"NTA. Asking a father to interact with his child an hour a day, no matter how hard they’ve worked, isn’t too much to ask. Part of having a child is participating in the care of that child.

Your husband (if his job is like most) goes to his place of employment, and after his shift, leaves. His work and home life are neatly separated. You don’t get that luxury. You don’t get to say “I’m clocked out for the day.” How is it that because he has a day job you should get a never ending job where no one even cares how long it’s been since you had a break? "
b2pltp,"NTA. Listen to me. You DO NOT have the obligation to be an unpaid caretaker for ANYONE. FUCK that. Go to college, live your dreams, do whatever you need to do, but do NOT let yourself be guilt tripped into being someone's nurse. You'll live a bitter, unfulfilling life, and you'll hate your family so much for it. And your sisters are fucking bitches for attacking your masculinity. Disgusting behavior.

Also remember: If they try to bring up how they cared for you, raised you, wiped your ass when you were a baby... All of that is IRRELEVANT. You did not ASK to be born. If she's having health issues, well, you can try to pitch in (along with your sisters) for a nurse. But you do not, do NOT fuck over YOUR own life for someone else's. Not now, not ever."
b2pmbs,NTA. Don't dish if you can't take it. But your shitalking skills could use some improvement :)
b2pq52,"NTA. Your dad is being an asshole.

First of all, you wanting to date a trans-man does not make you lesbian - you are a a woman who wants to date a man - that is straight.

I would urge you to work to ignore your father's religious statements. Specifically, when he mentioned that you ""seek out"" people he thinks are ""weird"" to befriend, he is literally describing the way Jesus lived his life. 

Your father is an insecure, hate-filled false christian who is trying to pass his lack of compassion on to his daughter."
b2psp9,"NTA in my books. He provoked you by sleeping with your partner and insults, so you took the bait, but it didn't escalate further than a pretty mild verbal insults. Oh, and I know this is not an advice sub, but the ""everyone"" should be dead to you if not already - they're taking sides in someone elses' business they clearly don't understand. "

b2r6uw,"NTA. Just because she is gay and has “reclaimed” the term, doesn’t mean other potentially gay people in the office have and it could be hurtful to them to hear all the time. Also as a big lesbo, I would NEVER use the f****t slur. IMHO only gay men can use that word because even if she’s been called it it’s derogatory to them, not her, like a word like dyke would be.

I don't think your brother and step dad realize how much this can stick with a person, and that it is not just something you ""get over"".

My father was in the hospital for just shy of a week prior to his passing from cancer.  It wasn't a big surprise, he had been getting progressively sicker and we knew we were looking at DAYS rather than months or years.   My brother asked me the morning he died if I was going to go up and say goodbye - I couldn't do it.  I didn't want my last memory of my typically strong, jovial father to be of him in a hospital bed, frail and sickly and not at all the person he was before.  

Like you, I carry a small amount of ""what if?"" kind of guilt - but at the end of the day, you have to stop and think about what your Grandpa would have wanted for you.  Do you think he would've wanted you to repeatedly run to his bedside, running yourself ragged in the process? I'd imagine not - I think he would want you to be happy, to know that it's okay and to keep on living your life.

Also, and I know this isn't especially useful now, but that's something you should've talked about before you moved in together. You're still pretty fresh into living together, so if there are any decisions you see coming down the pike in the future, talk about them now to save fighting later."

He wasn't necessarily the asshole until this bit:

So you've told him that you find his behavior unpleasant and that it makes you not want to talk to him, and his response is that you're wrong to feel that way? Holy shit, the asshole is strong in this one.

Tell him again, like you mean it. And if he gives you the same thing, tell him you want to go to couple's therapy. And if he won't, tell him you're not sure you can be married to him. It is not okay to treat your partner this way.

Not being argumentative. That's not a big deal. But refusing to listen to your partner or care how they feel. That's just beyond the pale."

How A and B handle themselves is not your responsibility or fault.

Your sister needs to talk to a mental health professional so she can move through the feelings. Hell you could offer couple counciling to her so you can put forward that you are sorry but struggle emotionally that she often brings it up. 

Everyones childhood sucks for one reason or another. Your sister sees you as one of the reasons her childhood sucked sometimes. She needs to get over that if she wants to maintain a relationship with you and if she does then it is up to her to get over it no one can get over it for her. 

You know you were the arsehole when you were younger regardless of your own mental health issues.

When I got out of the Army I was stoked to smoke weed again! It was the best. So much better than drinking. 

I did exactly this, I’d smoke and fall asleep in my chair and this went on in cycles of 2-3 weeks at a time. After about a year my marriage was absolute shit. We were out of sync, always arguing, my wife was growing to resent me. 

It took some serious life changes and an intense amount of MC and IC to realize that I had almost single-handedly destroyed my own marriage because I liked to smoke weed and neglect my wife. 

It seems like a small thing and you feel like you’re justified in your actions because “stress, alone time, not hurting anyone, blah blah blah”

Don’t do this, dude. It isn’t worth it. Smoking is nice. I still do it. Just in moderation now because my wife and her emotional and physical needs are infinitely more important. It isn’t the sleep she’s missing that upsets her. It’s not having her husband in bed with her, it’s that comfort of your partner, it’s the physical closeness. 

I’m begging you, learn from my mistakes here. If you value your relationship then you need to tighten your shit up quick, my guy. "

b316kc,"ESH. You were mad at your dad and you took it out on your mom. Your dad should have listened to you. Your mom, knowing you hated the couch, tried to make you feel better about it by coaxing you to say that you liked it even when she knew you didn't."
b31912,"YTA. You gave your friend money without asking for them to pay you back, and they see it as a gift. If you had specified and they had agreed,
You would be NTA."
b31b2o,"NTA. This sounds like a situation that's screaming for a ""just send the gift"" response. That being said, going anyways to make your parents happy doesn't sound like it would be the worst response."
b31df4,NAH. This is a good relationship and everything seems fine. Don't worry about it.
b31g4z,"Ok so let me get this right:

- You tip waiters not for good service, but because the restaurants don't pay them enough,

- BUT there's a law where if you earn below minimum wage the restaurant has to make up the difference,

- BUT if waiters have to get reimbursed then they're fired,

- BUT most waiters earn well above normal minimum wage from tips and don't want a minimum wage in place of tips

- BUT there's still an expectation for tipping to be a mandatory charge, not... well, a 'tip'?

I really can't make sense of this being the customer's onus? Surely if you want to rely on tips for your wage you shouldn't be expectant of customers to tip you regardless of service?"
b31jby,NTA--that's what the county is for. Plus you can probably complain anonymously (depending on where you live)
b31kyf,"Do it. Yeah, you'd probably be the asshole but do it anyway. "
b31lal,"NTA, just use stubhub and avoid the drama, if she doesn't give you the full amount up front, you'll never see it."
b31tv3,NTA. Your aunt was butting in a convo that didn’t involve her. Giving your dad comfort is ok just like “motivation” which I’m guessing is your aunts debate. 
b31u9y,"NAH - It can be hard to unlearn phrases in certain contexts. Yours reasoning being that you feel horrible when you forget, tells me you’re not the asshole."
b31un6,"YTA. Yous clearly have a system in place but you’re not following through with your side of the agreement. You’re leaving dishes out overnight which just makes them harder to clean and then your SO ends up having to clean it for you.

Edit: YTA asshole furthermore for telling your wife just to ‘get over it’ she’s taking care of your child when you work and then makes dinner as well. Just do the dishes, it’s not going to take you that long is it?

Edit2 OP said both he and the wife work, but he get home earlier and take scare of their kid for a few hour.s 
In that case my verdict is still YTA. This is because you wife has came straight home work, has cooked a dinner which can take anywhere from a half to a couple hours, and you’re not willing to spend the 15-30 minutes to clean. "
b31v1s,"NTA

Your mom is being an irresponsible pet owner and mother. She had your cat in her house first so your cat should come first."
b31wfu,"NTA. They don't get to lay all the blame on you for the conversation running dry, what with conversation being a two-way street and what with John having scorned your current partner."
b320w2,"NAH - Assuming a US state, for most, if there was a will that was probated and you were going to receive something from it, you would have been notified. Assuming no will and typical estate laws, then all your dad's assets would go to his wife/your mom. 

AKA - if you haven't been notified by now, then there's not likely anything there for you. "
b321yp,"NTA, obviously. 

Get your own place as soon as feasible. Though I feel bad to call your dad an asshole since he has what is presumably some form of mental illness, it's still a terrible thing to inflict upon one's child. "
b3246d,"NAH, I feel bad for him, but that's clearly an antisocial behavior that's going to cause problems for him as well as you. Just try to be nice when you ask him"
b32532,NAH   Just not a big enough deal to consider anyone an asshole.
b3253k,"NAH. You both clearly have very different desires for this experience. Both of your ideas of fun aren't fun for each other. If your friend wants a photoshoot and you don't, it's perfectly reasonable to tell him to take his own trip."
b326g7,"NTA 

I was thinking the opposite, until you said “give me 20 or 30 minutes.”  That’s fair. It doesn’t matter that YOU think the walk home is nice, if she doesn’t, she doesn’t. But the world can’t immediately stop every time she makes this mistake. Half an hour is just not that bad, though. "
b327hf,"NTA

If you aren't scheduled to work, you are not an asshole for not picking up extra shifts"
b3288j,"YTA - You're there for him, not her. I know you don't want to sabotage them or anything, but not wanting to be in the wedding party is kind of a low key sabotage... Besides, you not being there isn't going to magically make him not want to marry her anymore. Assuming their relationship is not destined to last, it will have to work it's way to that naturally."
b32ac1,"NTA

Fuck incels. If you asked “do I need to tell people I’m a man?” it would sound ridiculous, and this is just as ridiculous.

Any time you apply this gender test and it’s true, then you are dealing with someone society would be better off without."

Your kids dont want to move, your family doesnt want you to move, only you and your hot new flame. Leave the kids and go alone"
b32d83,"I’ll say YTA but who am I kidding

##Thats exactly what I would do"
b32gev,Honestly YTA. Multiple calls from your cousin should have been a sign. I know you may not have expected him but at least pick up. Cousin > Game imho
b32h5t,"YTA because I think this is not a good post for this sub. You've only been with this guy for 6 weeks- so of course you’re not an asshole for deciding you're not compatible; but I think you already know that. I think you really just came here to stir the political pot, and that's not what this sub is for."
b32h6v,"ESH. While your mother needs to let go of her anger, you need to think about why you bothered to “reconnect” with a father who abandoned you growing up and who’s only now come back into your life now that it’s convenient and $free$ to do so. Nine times out of ten this situation winds up with you finding out that he stayed out of your life not because he was kept out but because he chose to stay out of your life. Be really careful. "
b32hhh,"NTA

Your friends are bullies, they can take their opinions and shove it where the sun don't shine."
b32jri,"NTA 

But I’d clarify with her by sending her a message saying you’re going ahead with the idea, as her lack of response has let you know she’s not interested in participating."
b32lhh,NAH. You both seem like you enjoy walking together. One day you weren't up to it and did what you could to avoid him being hurt by that.
b32m8b,NAH. I’ve known girls like you. You’re just really friendly with everyone. Can’t blame him though for getting signals crossed. It happens in high school
b32r2z,"NAH, for now. They may not be aware of the issue (as it does not occur when they are at home). Definitely worth raising it with them, ideally not in a 'shut your dog up' way."
b32shl,You gotta talk to your friend. 
b32tgy,"NTA I don't know where that woman got that idea from, but kosher food may be bought and consumed by anyone. In fact many foods you regularly buy are probably kosher and you never realized it"
b32x2h,"ESH i think you both need to get better at letting the other know when they say something that offends you. And don't bring up past shit when you're arguing, that can get ugly really fast."
b32ymu,"YTA- you should feel bad. This was heinous behavior. She didn't ""get involved"" in your relationship- she sympathized more with one friend than another- and just going off your post here, I can see why. "
b32yv0,"NTA

Asshole dads will never change. You've been more than kind to him. "
b33304,NAH - you can put any requirements you want but it will limit the people who may contact you.  May want to word it so people realize you are somewhat negotiable such as you don't mind if you aren't home. 
b3338x,"NTA

Talk to their parents, because it's their responsibility to reign their kids in."
b333xn,"NTA.

*For those first two weeks his parents were overbearing and insufferable--as you might expect from the parents of an only child. They had secret meetings with doctors, tried to sign papers without me, interrupted doctors during rounds, and talked to people about clinical trials without telling me. And they were there 24/7. Never left.*

Oh hell to the no. This says it all to me."

b33cwj,"YTA.  Calm down for the sake of everyone.  ""Standing your ground"" has no place on the road. Being ""right"" has no place.  Safety is what matters."
b33f81,"NTA. 

She has a toxic personality, and I'm glad that you decided to cure ties with her. Move on with your life, and find some new friends who will support you. Good luck OP!"
b33gk6,"NTA (not daughter) although I understand your ex’s concerns. 16 and 11 years old are just the right age to get into all kinds of mischief. However your ex doesn’t get to point fingers since he was the one who forced the situation. 

Side note: was no one available to babysit over the weekend?"
b33gkd,NTA- you're friend sounds kind of selfish and isnt able to realize that everyone has different lives away from their friends. How this guy is almost 40 and hung up on this kind of thing tells me he doesnt have much goin for him in his life right now.
b33hhc,"NAH. 

This is the point whet you do need to step back, look at things, and have an honest and open conversation with your SO. 

I wish you the best of luck OP."
b33jiy,"NTA. I understand why he's upset and insecure and that the distance has clearly been hard on him.

But that doesn't give him the right to try and dictate who you speak to and hang out with. It doesn't give him the right to call you a whore or pull that passive aggressive ""Just go hang out with them then"" shit.

You need to have a long and serious talk with him about how this isn't going to work if he can't trust you. You deserve better than a guy that makes you give up your friends, so he needs to buck up."
b33q0v,"YTA

If it’s a good fit for your MIL, then it’s her right to accept. Plus it would mean an additional positive person on staff which may help the culture of the school.

But also- it sounds like your child went through a lot of changes at that school, and I’m in no way saying he is to blame for his behaviours, but if his behaviours were making the teacher cry on a regular basis, it wasn’t unreasonable for her to request him removed from her class, and it’s not something you should hold such anger at the school about. If you had a client visit you every day in your office and made you cry, you would ask to not have them as your direct client as well. Just because your son is flourishing now, doesn’t mean that teacher didn’t try her hardest, and it seems petty to hold that much anger towards the school over it. "
b33rfx,NAH - Just young love.
b33u9t,"NAH, some people just aren't cut out for video games, while others like competitive play."
b33wgt,"YTA. I live in a city and I HATE, repeat HATE people that (a) walk around singing out loud (especially when they can’t really sing) or rapping, (b) listen to their music through speakers instead of headphones. Seriously, most people you encounter out in public do not want to listen to you or your music. They want to go about their day without being forced to listen to other people try to sing or forcing everyone to listen to their music. 

IMHO, it’s very inconsiderate of the people around you. "
b33za5,"NTA

If the men say that ""women"" on tinder and not ""people"" on tinder should always include full body pics, you know what kind of men you're talking to. "
b341ys,"YTA. You shouldn't have said it, your reason makes no sense, and then you should have apologized once you knew it bothered someone."
b3448x,NTA from what I can tell but this probably needs more context. It sounds like the dude might have overreacted also 
b3450h,"NTA.

Not your circus, not your monkeys. He's an asshole for cheating on his GF but you're not his wrangler."
b346wy,"ESH: you’re a grown woman who can make her own decisions. He didn’t dye your hair, you did. So don’t blame him for your own actions. If you are easily persuaded by people, then maybe work on that about yourself. 

As for him, he could have used better word choice instead of saying your hair wasn’t nice before. "
b34dvd,NTA. In no way are you the asshole. This dude sounds creepy as fuck. 
b34gzf,"YTA because of your approach to the whole situation. You should have *suggested* that she should sit this one out, not *tell* her that she will not be going. "
b34kg4,"YWBTA

I’d actually get some students together and talk to the teacher. There might be a reason he’s doing this that you’re not privy, too, it could be stimming for example."
b34mau,"NTA

Doesn't matter whether or not the parents are homophobes, kids should be exposed to real life scenarios (such as gay people). You did nothing wrong by showing a movie rated PG-13. Unless they had explicitly stated not to watch anything that touched on homosexuality beforehand, I don't think they can really say you're in the wrong. "
b34nb1,"YTA You have a warped and misanthropic (literally) perspective on humanity. It can be both profane *and* transcendent. Cruel *and* altruistic. Scornful *and* magnanimous. Mankind is a panoply of dualities. Closing your eyes and claiming you only see darkness leads you nowhere, and it leaves you blind.

You're creating a negative feedback loop by internalizing the bad things that happen to or around you and neglecting the good things. How many people *haven't* lied to you on any given day? How many *haven't* chastised you or looked down on you?

If someone you meet is an asshole, then they're an asshole. If *everyone* you meet is an asshole, then *you're* the asshole."
b34q1y,"NTA, but I have serious doubts about this exchange actually going that way. Are you sure you're not shitposting/exagerating what happened?"
b34rje,"NAH but you are the first person I've heard of who likes to switch sides even when the room isn't rearranged, or there's a move involved.

&#x200B;

Speaking of - could you rearrange the furniture to mix things up? (switching sides or not)  Not sure about the dimensions of your room or if that is remotely possible."
b34rzr,"NTA, you woke him up and he refused. You had plans to see the movie and you did. "
b34u7g,NTA. If you are going 5 over they can just wait.
b34vls,NAH to YTA she clearly doesn't want a baby. You wanting one matters less because she is the one who may die in childbirth and can't continue with her education for a long time. You can be upset but you have to let her do what she decides and it sounds like she has decided but you are talking about it everyday to change her mind. You wanting to be a father doesn't override her not wanting to be a mother. Maybe in the future like you discussed but this isn't a happy accident for her. 
b34wkb,"NtA - your wedding, your day, your guests, your choices."
b34ws8,YTA. Be an adult and talk to her. 
b34xzs,YTA.  I wouldn’t want strangers having keys to my place.  Did you even tell the roommates that your family was going to drop in?
b34ykt,NTA your sexuality is your’s. You aren’t Pansexual. Nothing wrong with that.
b34ylm,"NTA 

A re-write is extra work. Especially if he basically wants a whole new script. There’s a lot of companies that operate like that. The initial service is free but all additional services are charged. It’s your time and you should be paid. "
b352vo,"NTA 

You're helping as much as you reasonably can. She is tr ing to guilt trip you. She should be grateful you're helping as much as you are."
b3549o,"YTA -

Lmaooo. Money you're ""owed""?  Tell me why you think you're owed?!

Your sibling is going to university to better themselves and so isn’t currently making much, if any, money. Which is why your parents are pitching in; to help out so that your sibling can better their future. 

You, however, can join the workforce immediately since you’re not going to university. As such, you made it a choice to start your independent life immediately; so why should you be owed money for that?

Grow up, use your head. It's not hard. "

b354my,[deleted]
b356hn,NTA. holy hell. I’d start complaining to management more often. 
b358s1,NTA; jfc your parents sound like a nightmare. It seems like your mom is an enabler and your dad... Well that seems self explanatory. If I were you I'd get as far away as possible
b35a1i,"NTA. Probably NAH actually.  If there's only one machine and their clothes were done, you did what had to be done. Hell, you helped them out."
b35cks,"NTA. You gave him reasons why you wouldn't hire him, which better than getting hopes up and them resulting in him getting fired and you looking bad. You don't have a responsibility for him not having a job."
b35dsc,"NTA, you may not be a 15 year old girl but it sure sounds like you are dating a 15 year old boy "
b35fd0,NAH - but this sounds like a recipe for disaster 
b35ism,"NAH.  You are justified for being creeped out that your mom is checking in on you (perhaps ask her to text you before she checks your location), however she is just concerned with your safety and knowing where you are, which is much more caring than many parents honestly.  I personally don't find anything wrong with this but My father and I also have this installed so we know where each other are, and I also have this with several of my friends.  So I mean it's only weird if you think its weird."
b35j11,"NTA. this goes against your comfort level. It’s ok to stick up for yourself. 

This guy sounds like a giant bag of dicks. "
b35jbo,"NAH. Maybe talk to your mom about some possible solutions, and if there are none I think it’s reasonable to bring up a discussion about next steps and letting her know this really isn’t working.

Also, I know she can’t stay with you the whole time during the renovation because the house is too small, but would it be possible to ask her to come over on a regular basis and stay during the day or evening for a few hours to help with the dogs so you can catch up on some sleep or get some quality time with the baby while your mom dogsits the dogs?"
b35jhe,"NTA. You could easily go to jail over her ex if you harass him or worse, he'll set his sights on you and oops, goes your life."
b35ljx,"YTA.

Your girlfriend sounds extremely charming and cute.

You, however, don't. I think it's awful that you think that about her, especially when she's not saying or doing anything wrong. She just wants to feel heard and valid, and you're gonna break her wings just because it makes you look bad or feel embarrassed. That's horrible, man. The example joke you wrote wasn't even bad or cringy. It just sounded like she was contributing to a conversation. Who cares if anyone thought it was funny or not? She obviously didn't. Why do you?

It's hard enough for girlfriends to try and make friends with our friends. You're going to make it *even harder* if you mention this to her. Not to mention, she'll be paranoid of ever speaking in her or your friends' presence again."
b35m5q,"YTA both of you are assholes. Save those places for people that really need it. Especially since you say that you can afford the full price.

Also, your argument about  being able to pay off your debt quicker makes no sense. Would you girlfriend not bring in $300+ extra a month if she worked full time? You could pay the full amount  of rent and still pay off your debts with her working more. 

Edit: You actually  said the 1bd/1 bath was $890. But the subsidized one for $550 is a studio. So in reality,  the savings are less than $300 per month. 

If my math is right, you guys just became even more selfish and greedy."
b35nhx,NTA- she asked you expecting an honest answer and you gave it to her. it was better than leading her on
b35o1i,"NTA- you can cut off a friendship for any reason, especially if you think she is doing something morally wrong"
b35ohl,NTA 
b35p0s,Nta. You were upfront that you didn't want kids. 
b35qy7,"YTA- if it was a group project you shouldn't have done everything if your partner wanted to do some and especially if they will be penalized for you having done it all. although your intentions weren't necessarily bad, it was still an inconsiderate thing to do"
b35s8w,Meh
b35yfy,"Honestly, I'm going with NAH. 

I get your stance, but I can also see why your BF would think including your children is different than what you ex did. "
b3659i,"YTA -  go somewhere else and talk or text or something. Even if studying weren't a bit more important than talking, she has asked you to not do it and you don't even compromise by keeping your chat short or, again, going somewhere else."
b365ll,"YTA

You don't get to decide who she's friends with or who she hugs. If she needs friends outside your relationship, even male friends, that's healthy and normal. 

You need to figure out your own insecurities that are causing you to have issues with this "

b36c4k,"**ESH**. You for banging her sister. Her sister for banging you. Your GF for cheating. 

Come on, her kids call you uncle from your relationship w her sister and you’re fuckin their mom. That sucks. "
b36fv5,"NTA make it clear to your supervisors what you think is fair. Every workplace is different as to how involved your immediate supervisor is, so they may not see the full picture or be in the know of how much you have been working/covering for others recently. I wouldn't start with a hostile approach, but after hearing me out if they refused to reconsider something more reasonable I would seek employment elsewhere."
b36jan,YTA. It's not your spot to use. You can't give a heads up for something that isn't yours because you can't just plan to use it. All you can do is ask politely to borrow it. 
b36jdq,"YTA

While you’re not wrong that 13 is old enough to make her own lunch, it’s maybe not old enough to make the right decisions on what to have for lunch, depending on her own personal maturity and nutrition education. 

But that’s beside the point, your wife obviously prefers the 13yr old not to make her own lunch, so it’s a chore she does, she asked you to do it and you’re refusing. This means it’s back on your wife to figure out a solution and put it in place, which means you’ve given her more chores to do when she just wanted you to do these two simple little chores to make her life easier. Just make your wife’s life easier, make the lunches without making it into an argument she now has to deal with."

b36oy4,"NTA.

If he wanted you to drive him, or even let him drive you there and you drive back, that would be one thing, but driving in seperate cars just so that you can watch his luggage and avoid spending a few extra minutes getting a trolley is another.

If this was at any other time of the day, it might have been mildly acceptable, but definitely not at 4am."
b36ppb,"NTA - “Shes alwayd had a few rules with lesbians and that she just doesnt want to see PDA, which is chill.” that’s not chill and considering you’re a lesbian I’m surprised you don’t have a problem with that.

Hetero PDA is allowed, lesbian PDA is not. Asshole rule."
b36s1q,"NTA. I said this and did this to my mother who is OCD, Bipolar and Manic Depressive. I couldn’t have her in my life. She was/is emotionally abusive, manipulative and unpredictable. So, I blocked her out for 10 years with limited interaction. During which time, I’ve had 3 kids and one of them is just like her. I love him more than word can describe. It hurts my soul that I abandoned my mother and left her alone as everyone has always done to her throughout her life. I see my son being alone and abandoned once I’m long gone. "
b36s74," **NAH** except for your friend who got snippy about things. You and your ex-husband have done the best by your son that you can. You and your current husband are also taking care of HIS sons as best you can. The situations are not always going to be equitable. Your ex-husband certainly doesn't owe your step-sons anything.

Wanting to leverage the ability to take care of your son with child support funds is laudable, not asshole behavior."
b36veg,"NAH

If he's living there, he should pay rent and utilities. If he didn't contribute to the down payment, then it's just rent, not mortgage contribution. However, if that is the situation, understand that the maintenance on the house and any needed repairs, etc. are 100% on you. He's a tenant, and isn't responsible for care and maintenance of the property."
b36we8,"NTA - I have three reasons:

1. Your trip, your birthday.

2. They have heard that it makes others uncomfortable, and are ok with the consequences (as adults ought to be.)

3. You'd be MORE of an ass by forcing two other couples to endure that."
b370td,"NTA- this is the main problem with big group outings, it’s hard to get everyone to agree. There should be an unwritten rule that people can do what they want when the group as a whole can’t agree. "
b371q7,NTA. I would absolutely let your boss know. Allowing the kids to say those words are not his choice but the choice of the parents/guardians. I truly do not see how that could be a constructive activity if he was laughing and encouraging the behavior. 
b371tg,"YTA No one is responsible for your child but you. As adults we are conditioned to avoid other’s children for fear that a parent will accuse us of kidnapping or overstepping their bounds (also why would she lie to the police?! There’s an actual penalty for this and it would make no logical sense to lie to them)

The cars have nothing to do with this. It’s embarrassing that the few minutes you took your eyes off your kid and they disappeared and it feels like you are looking for someone to blame when we know where the blame should lie. 

"
b37399,"NTA - that’s not a guest that is a full time tenant. Your roommate is in the wrong and first needs to get yours, and your landlords permission. Assuming he gets its, rent needs to be negotiated with all of those parties plus the girlfriend."
b378l9,"Just commenting to say Bonafide Good Son ™ should be your flair for like, all of Reddit. And NTA."
b378up,NTA it sounds like you are doing everything possible to keep it down. Would some throw rugs help dampen the sound?
b3795t,"NTA honestly, your mom needs to understand that part of her job is letting you grow up and experience life. The fact that you are dissatisfied and WANTING to leave is reason enough to pack your bags. If she is not willing to at least chat about it, you have every right to up and leave. You are in charge of your life, and you aren’t in charge of your mom’s (or anyone else’s) happiness.

No parent likes saying goodbye to their kids, but she needs to support you to develop into an independent adult. Anything less than that is clear-cut manipulation. "
b37998,"ESH 

kinda, in America, for delivery, $2-5 is expected.

Actually worked for dominoes and half the delivery goes to the driver for GAS and wear and tear on the car, so not technically a tip.

He shouldn’t be asking for a higher tip. That’s incredibly unprofessional.

b37avz,"NAH.  Hearing that can be hard for a person, especially a gay male, and that's fair on his end.  It's a valid feeling, and it sounds like he expressed it respectfully.  So he's NTA here.

If it's one of the catcalls (it's been forever since I saw Rocky, so forgive me if I don't remember), that's fine to yell in this context and you did not know it was a sensitive area for him.  So you're NTA here.  "
b37e21,"NTA. You pick up after your cat, she picks up after hers. Obviously leave some wiggle room there for certain circumstances (i.e: ""I'm going out tonight, would you mind looking after my cat while I'm gone?""). 

If you aren't prepared to clean up after pets, don't get them. Simple."
b37eqi,"YTA. She was right. Keep your promises, or don't bother making them. Her feelings were totally valid, and you're acting like she was unjustified in feeling the way she did.

You're obviously not the asshole for leaving her, because forcing her to stay with someone like you would be bad, but the way you did it and the circumstances leading up to it put you squarely in the wrong."

b37fqo,"I'll definitely attest that i was not the best equipped emotionally to know how to handle something like this at the time, I didn't say anything that wasn't true or that i regretted, but I definitely didn't say it in the nicest or loving tone (this wasn't frequent). I was more scared than anything of finding him with foam in his mouth not waking up. He died 2 years after these confrontations."
b37h4t,"NTA. You both are looking for two totally different things in a relationship and if he isn't wanting to move in the same direction as you, then it isn't your fault nor his.

He isn't entitled.  By that same token, if you're ready to make a break from him, do so completely - no more one night stands, no more fwb, no more doing laundry at his place, no more asking for help on projects.

It's great that you worry about your friends, and respect the law.

I am so, so sorry you are finding yourself in this awful situation, and I'm sorry for your loss.

For what it's worth, I know someone who got an abortion after her partner died. You aren't the only person who has ever been in this situation and I hope you figure out something that works for you."
b3bmbu,"YTA, your entire post is just complaining about your wife. If you feel that negatively about her maybe you should try communicating some of your problems.

So to break down what's happening; You lied to your wife, went off and thoroughly enjoyed lying to her (this isn't a one time lie, if she thinks it's a business trip then you clearly aren't telling her all the fun things you're doing), and now you're sitting here on Reddit putting down your wife and trying to make her look like an annoying ""princess.""

Don't marry someone if you don't love them, and if you think talking about someone that *that* is love, then I feel (even more) bad for your wife.

Edit to add;

Stop telling me ""it's ok to not like every detail about your spouse"". I know it is. What isn't okay is the complete lack of respect he has when talking about her, coupled with the lying. It is possible to talk about the things you don't like about your spouse while still showing them at least a tiny bit of respect."

b3cie5,"NTA - It's a justified punishment. If she really needs the internet for school work (it is a legit reason) and the library won't work, then maybe limited, supervised internet use at home just for work.

The monitoring of texts did stand out as a bit harsh though. That could be bordering on too much invasion of privacy. You'd be better off just taking her phone away instead of monitoring her conversations IMHO."
b3ciwa,"ESH

Some timeline issues in your post. Was your first date with Sarah before or after the coffee?
If it was before, he sucks for not coming clean about their hook-up. If it was after, he was a real asshole for sleeping with her after knowing where things stood.

Again, timeline issues, but Sarah sucks for the same reasons, with the added reason that she let the dating drag on for 2 months without telling you. Also for sleeping with him while trying to spark a relationship with you. 

You are an asshole because of this line: 

>asking her to block him?

This implies some sort of ultimatum made. It implies some level of degraded trust. The trust is understandable, but ultimatums don't work in relationships. Either you trust her or you don't. No middle ground. If you don't trust her there is no point in this relationship and you are essentially forcing her to alienate her friends for the sake of a doomed relationship. "

b3einf,"NAH.

I understand why you feel the way you do and I think your father's wife has overstepped in pushing your son to spend time with her brother.

But at the same time, this woman isn't just your father's wife.  She is your son's step-grandmother.  Up until now she's seen your son at least once a week.  She is part of your son's family.  

I don't actually think it is out of line for your son to call her brother Uncle.  I think you have the right to say that isn't something you are comfortable with, but it isn't totally bonkers of her to do. 

I am uncomfortable with your son being forced to spend time alone with an adult he barely knows, but at the same time a seven year old is learning social skills.  I don't think it is a great idea to allow him to ignore his grandpa and step-grandma to do his own thing even when they want to interact with him.  That doesn't support him building social skills.  I think the middle ground here could be something like a board game session after homework is done.

You really seem to hate your father's wife and I'm not sure how deserved that is.  Reading this, I get the feeling that everyone involved (including you) is very rigid and ""My way or the highway.""  Leaving the situation may be the best option, but I think it is a good idea for you to pause and really think about the situation from a few different angles.  "

I know it might be an antiquated idea, but just because it isn't important to you doesn't mean it's not important to others. Some people feel a strong tie to their family heritage and have an urge to keep their family lines alive.

She seems to be doing everything on the up-and-up in terms of keeping this strictly platonic. She's open with you about their conversations.

b3evio,"NAH ultimately you aren’t the asshole for prioritising your own health over someone else. Getting into a relationship is a commitment to share someone’s mental burdens. Only you can judge whether or not you can cope with that.

You ate food you knew she was expecting to have the chance to eat and didn't get a replacement. She's allowed to be (mildly) annoyed and you should offer to pick some more stuff up at the grocery store. 

If you treat your relationship like it's a business transaction, you will end up very unhappy and she will dislike you. Don't hold your $$ over her head. It's a A thing to do. "

If I left after a specific time the commute was almost two hours versus 35 minutes. I would sit your wife down and explain this to her. If she is still unreasonable, then once she realizes she’s going to have your daughter for 3+ hours longer alone in the afternoon because of it her attitude will change fast. "
b3g0j1,"NTA

You don't deserve to be treated this way, you aren't their slave."
b3g4x6,"Info: there’s so much missing here. It’s such a wtf situation and you should probably reconsider your relationship now. 

He should not have dropped his information on you in front of her, after saying “she’s gonna he living with us for a while”. 

how long has he known that she was pregnant with his child?
What’s he planning on doing in terms of he kid? Coparenting? Paying child support but not being a part of the kids life? Is a DNA test gonna be done? Are you willing to be a step mum? 

Edit: comments show that this is an absolute clusterfuck of a situation for OP. This isn’t just about having compassion and helping out a pregnant woman, she now has to consider if she’s willing to stay with a man who has a child with a woman who hates her, and take on the responsibility of being a step mother. "
b3g8dx,"Um yeah. Seriously ESH. This sounds like some shit straight out of a depressing indie film, like what? You were all doing fucked up things to each other, and thank goodness none of you remain in contact. Goodness gracious. "
b3g9ju,"NTA, stay far away from her. People like that are dangerous. "
b3gav1,"YTA - no one wants to listen to your bad cover attempts to soundless songs. 

It’s just as bad as someone carrying a Bluetooth speaker around with them. Headphones exist so we don’t all have to be subjected to other people’s musical tastes. 

It’s rude. "
b3gavl,"YTA

First of all, you can't insist on anything, you and your GF are both on the lease. It's her apartment as much as it is yours.

Second of all, you already said breaking the pet rule is widespread in your building. What ""risk"" are you claiming there is? If they found a cat in your apartment, you'd apologize and say you were looking after it for a friend. They'd say to get rid of it, and you'd say ""ok"". There is no risk.

What's going on here is that you don't want a cat, and you're leveraging the rules of the building to try to get your way. Asshole."
b3gbxe,NAH - but if it gets to the point you are using their money for drugs then you will be in the wrong.
b3gcfw,"NAH.  You're right, you're not married and there is no obligation to split anyway besides 50/50. But....
  
>I said that you wouldn’t ask a roommate to pay more because you happen to make less.   
  
Ouch.  After 5 years together, I would think you would treat her differently than you would just a roommate.  If you guys are serious and planning a future together, I don't think it's wrong of her to propose the idea.  Unless she wants the split to be 90/10 or something really unbalanced, I don't think she is an asshole either. 
  
"
b3gf0r,"NTA, there is some sort of tension there, perhaps he wanted you to come to break it... You were right not to go though and whatever is going on is something they need to resolve.. "
b3gfnk,"NTA - Just stop paying for stuff, then you'll see if he really thinks of you as an equal partner or a cash cow. "
b3gia0,"YTA - There is much more to therapy that taking drug.  Even if you have to take the drug, it doesn't necessary do what you think it is doing.  Your wife seems like an amazing, loving, and caring person.  If this is important for her, I think it is worth it for you to at leave give it a shot."
b3gidt,"NTA - The 8 month old being left unsupervised with the dog is bad enough, but MIL was on another floor with the vacuum going, and the front door was unlocked? I mean come on. You know it wasn’t only a minute, and so does she. Like whoop-de-fucking-doo. You raised two kids, and nothing happened. That means fuck all in this situation. You’re B’s parents, and you have a right to be upset about this. "
b3giip,"NTA - what a weird hypocritical thing to get annoyed about, I kind of want to know what’s at the root of this lunacy.

Side note, him leaving you to think about what you’ve done is a red flag sand super patronising."
b3giks,"YTA. 

Because it's obvious. You're petty and jealous and he dodged a fucking bullet with you. 

Also, probably SHP.

ETA- in many states ""revenge porn"" is a crime. Which is sharing nudes without someone's consent. He could report you."
b3gjj3,"NAH - but in all fairness if you are the one calling him, and you know the kids will be loud (they are kids, after all), you should expect it. Maybe try calling at a different time. "
b3gnc9,"I saw your other post just now about your flatmate - if that's how you treat her, no wonder she wants to break the lease and forfeit her deposit. YTA with that context.

b3gsny,NTA you bought it? You control it.
b3gvu9,"NTA. A marriage is supposed to be a partnership, which means equal weight to equal decisions, and if your wife is completely ignoring your wishes, that isn't happening.

I'd maybe look into couples therapy, or something similar. Not necessarily a psychotherapist specifically, but someone there to be an unbiased arbiter who can let you both advocate for yourselves and also call you out for the shit you need to be called out for (because none are free from sin, as it were).

But you're not in the wrong here."
b3h07o,"NAH.  I agree that you should have two separate types of ""dates"".  One involving you and her, and another involving the kids.  Only you two can determine whether it's too soon for you to meet her kids."

b3h36y,"YTA

He found out someone he had a lot of respect for did something terrible, your husbands cheating didn't just hurt you, your son doesn't live in an emotional bubble. Your son is completely okay to be so upset, and putting it down to disrespect ignores how he is also affected."
b3h6o6,"NTA

I know people say it time and time again, but it's okay to cut toxic people out of your life and he sounds toxic asf. Mental health isn't a joke or something to just brush off and he literally made a joke out of it

Don't feel like it's your fault because it isn't. Maybe try talking to your family about it and how his reaction has affected you. Your mum obviously cares if shes suggesting things to help"
b3h6uq,"NTA

b3hcas,they're in an urban area. And just because they keep things edible and out of reach does not mean the mice will just go away. They're coming from multiple apartments. Also I don't blame OP for not wanting to handle them.
b3hco3,"YTA for the way you said it.  Damn, dude.  She's dealing with a dying family member and you...reamed her out for taking pictures with that family member?  You could have just said that seeing pictures of him upsets you and you'd rather not see them.  Your reaction was pretty out there."

You annoyance is completely justified, and i get it, i think you should talk about this with your roommate firstly, try to find a solution to this issue, ask your other roomie if this also annoys them, if it's two against one then you'll be able to get your point across easily.

Best of luck, and keep your head cool!❤️"
b3hhuw,"YTA

Never a good idea to start any relationship with a lie. "
b3hif5,"YTA. No one, especially a trans person who should 100% know the issues related to gender and sexuality, should use someones sexuality as a joke, zinger, w/e you were trying to do. You know better. "
b3hjoi,"NAH. Your future wife is a performance artist. She doesn't want her reality into her performance. You feel that this is so significant it should be a part of all of her life, including the performance. So your not an asshole for asking. Its something to consider and talk about, perhaps with a counselor.

"
b3hp1a,ESH. Neither of you checked on the other. Idc what her or your excuse is. You’re both at fault for the same crime. Case closed
b3hq29,"NAH. 

You’re just going out for drinks with a buddy. I get this is your ex’s brother so it might make your fiancée feel uncomfortable with that fact. Do you know the reasoning as to why she hates it or is it just because it’s your ex’s brother? If it’s just that it’s your ex’s brother then maybe try to explain to her that all it is and see if she’s like to meet him to put all insecurities about it aside. "
b3hqsw,"NTA.

Honestly you guys arent married and this is a type of situation that could ruin your relationship."
b3hu9m,"Why didn’t you just print one photo to send to them and one to send to your parents? 

YTA for being petty."
b3hvgo,"NTA

I know reddit tends to side with employees, but I don't think you did anything wrong. The company is probably fine with giving you the parking since they've done it the last 4 years, the employee wouldn't budge and you knew the manager would so you asked to speak to the manager. It doesn't seem like you yelled or anything, and if the employee got into trouble it's probably for not following policy. It seems like a no brainer to extend the parking "
b3hy7r,"NTA - Store owners have the right to say no when you ask; as long as you respect that and still purchase, you're NTA. "
b3i06o,YTA- thats way overstepping and creepy
b3i255,"YTA

Everyone makes honest mistakes and he took the time to apologize. Social media is an evil monster, and you tried to use it as a weapon to attack someone. I get you guys are upset. But posting private emails to social media just to slander someone is childish "
b3i6bb,"> I'd never tell her that

NAH then. It's fine to have preferences but maybe you should rethink the relationship so she can be with someone who likes her body as is."
b3ieob,NTA. Chronic pain is not something that is easy for people to understand. Have your doctor or someone explain it again. Denying your access to medicine that would make your life livable is not good.

b3ikem,"NTA. I can understand him being over-eager and wanting to talk, but bitching at someone for not answering a casual call when they're trying to sleep, then getting upset despite a valid reason, definitely makes him an asshole"

b3j1jj,"YWBTA for not giving it to the friend you told could have it, but YWNBTA to apple"
b3j3fc,"Oh thank God you came to us first. Yes. YTA. Bras can be worn for weeks without washing. Think it through - they're not touching any part of the body that actually gets particularly sweaty or stinky. Women wash bras less often than they wash jeans. She's normal, you're just inexperienced."
b3j3qk,"NAH. Here’s a crazy thought: She has a calendar, you agree upon a frequency, she picks which days but doesn’t tell you!  That way you experience the spontaneity and she can prepare and plan as she needs to.  "
b3j63e,"NTA 

If you're paying for all of it why the hell are his other kids getting any of it? Why doesn't he take out his own life insurance policy if he wants to dictate how it's divided up?

b3j6vr,"NTA - She can’t expect you to move to another country and basically start a new life when she obviously is rearranging hers for her new boyfriend. 

She’s moved on, and although it’s really difficult, you should, too. Sorry my friend. "
b3j8sd,"ESH

Although I really don't think you suck, because I do understand your perspective and your wife is a major asshole for thinking it's okay to keep drinking during pregnancy.

However, it doesn't change the fact that ""her body her choice"" is still true. I agree with you that it would be better for everyone involved (including the baby) to have an abortion. But abortion can be quite traumatic to the woman, an no matter how many disabilities the baby will have, you still can't decide its life would be less ""worthy"" than the one of a healthy child."
b3j9hd,NAH.  The anxiety disorder is the asshole.  I don't see the harm in talking to them about it.
b3jdmt,NAH... If you don’t want a friendship that’s one thing but it sounds like you want to end the friendship because you thought she was acting that way because of you. Depression is a bitch and what you have to keep in mind is that it’s not about you. Don’t take it personally. I would also say that she opened up and trusted you from a really vulnerable position.
b3jfe3,"You are just way over thinking things, NAH"
b3jfla,"NAH, gotta make the cut off somewhere.  People are allowed to hangout with whoever they want to hangout with.  But this includes you and you wouldn't be TA for not hanging out with these folks just like they aren't TAs for not wanting to hangout with other mutual friends."
b3jiam,"You're not the asshole for feeling the way you feel: it's totally reasonable.

YTA for saying 'it's fine' when you weren't *really* fine with it.

You should have this conversation with your BF; right now, he's probably more confused than anything, since from his POV you were cool with it, then you backed out and freaked out about it.  Apologize, hug it out, and keep on loving each other.

It sounds like you had good intentions; you just didn't go about handling those in the right way.

Good luck OP, I believe in you."
b3jj8z,NTA- she deliberately lied about something in order to kick start your relationship. Not only has she damaged the trust she didn’t allow you to decide if her real age would be a dealbreaker for you before getting into a relationship.

It’s kind of out of respect to put your phone away while you’re in that kind of environment. 
"
b3jqoq,Yes. YTA. You could have easily said no and gone about your day but you went the extra mile to punish your friend that could have repercussions greater than you think. 
b3js4z,"INFO Have you talked to her about her drug use, or has that conversation been avoided like the topic of her previous employment? I think if you haven't tried confronting her about her habit and lack of a job because of it, it's not kick out time yet. She may not realize how badly she is affecting your home life (some people really are that unaware) and deserves a bit of a chance to clean up before losing her housing.

If you have brought it up though and she's just giving you the run around at this point, then NTA for telling her she needs to leave. You deserve a roommate who respects your shared responsibilities. Be straight with her that using drugs without seeking help and not helping out at home are why. Talk to her BF about why she's getting kicked out if you feel the need to, but tbh he is an adult and is probably already aware of her issues so it's up to him how much he allows her to bring her problems into his life too."
b3jsz3,"NTA. If you caught her in a similar situation before, I’d say it’s completely likely it’s happening again. No one should fly off the handle over their SO seeing messages on their lock screen. No one without anything to hide, that is. "
b3jtcv,"YTA. Or I should say, you *would* be the asshole if you actually started something with girl #2.

That's really all you need to know. Don't lead her on. Don't do it just because you're not able to be with girl #1. Just don't."
b3jxlu,NAH but it depends on how you say it. Maybe just tell her until she is established the extra income is really useful and go on about the state of the economy a bit.
b3k02a,It would have been kind to give her a chance to prove whether she's grown and learned and would apologize. But do you owe her that? No. Are you an asshole for not giving her that? No. NTA.

b3k2sl,"NAH; you guys did agree on coming to her operations, and I thinkthat her operations will probably be harsher than the chemo. If you were able to stay for both, that would be cool, but you shouldn't feel guilty for only being able to help her with one"

When you're the one that is pregnant it's just so huge, and you think about it all the time that it's hard to believe anyone can think about anything else.  When I was pregnant with my first, my husband struggled to do those things too.  Part of it was that he was worried we'd lose the baby and he didn't want to get too attached.  Part was just that it wasn't as ""real"" for him as it was for me.  I hope you two can sit and talk, and share your feelings on both sides."

It sounds like the co-worker may have Asperger's syndrome, or be on the autism spectrum.

I'd recommend that you be gentle about the matter and quietly explain to him, while both of you are on a break or something, that following someone around is not acceptable and can/will get him in trouble. Don't paint it as it's his fault, just be explanatory; something along the lines of ""Hey buddy, noticed you were doing something earlier this week, and just wanted to let you know that you shouldn't do that, because I care about you and don't want you to do something to scare someone else, intentionally or not."

He could have done them the night before, you could have done them together the night before, you both could have left those chores alone!"

Stop micromanaging your girlfriend. She is an adult going in to have a meeting *in public* with her boss. You shouldn't get involved. 

Age doesn't matter; this is business and unless there is some special circumstance he has said or some something shady and she feels threatened, there's no reason you should worry about him.

You going could result in her looking REALLY bad to her new boss btw. "

b3npq5,"YTA, a little bit:

You make a lot of ""jokes"". Most of which, clearly, are not actually funny, they *are* a matter of you refusing to admit you're wrong about even the smallest of details.

That is *really fucking annoying* to live with. Your brother isn't reacting to *just* this incident, he's reacting to *all of the things*. He's going to have a hair-trigger on shit like this because it's a raw nerve.

It's not funny. It's pretty much never funny. Your brother over-reacting like that is a sign that you're on his last goddamn nerve.

Like, undoubtedly you have background issues or something that made you this way, but at some point you've got to learn that ""my whole life I've been really irritating"" does not mean that it's okay.

Work on your social skills and what constitutes *actually a funny joke* and what constitutes *being annoying*."

It sounds like you’re doing everything in your power to fix your (very very small) mistake. Does it suck its happening? Yes. Is he making it ridiculously harder than it has to be? Also yes.

You are offering many, many, compromises. He should either take you up on them, as they don’t inconvenience him, or if he really wants to push his idea (taxi) he should just say forget it and cover the money.

The issue here is he’s not even willing to compromise. You’re giving option after option, and he is dead set on his taxi solution with 0 consideration for you. Yes, this is technically your fault but it was a *mistake*, has he never made one? Does he plan on never making any?  "
b3oqsp,"YTA.

Your father is great for offering him that job.

And it's also OK that you advice him on his situation.

b3p4c3,"NAH

 I think using the words 'mouth herpes' makes it sounds a lot scarier than 'cold sore' as they are more generally known. It is up to you if you want to be with this person or not but you really should look into the details of this virus before you decide. HSV-1 affects approximately 2 out of every 3 people. (You could have been having 'mouth contact' with any of these people in the past and not known). HSV-1 is only usually contagious from the moment she starts feeling the tingling until the cold sore heals. So kissing her etc when the cold sores aren't active isn't generally a risk. And as someone else said, you may already have it and you just don't know it. 

EDIT: Calling this virus an STD is also really misleading (although it can be spread that way through oral sex) it is just as likely, probably more likely, that she caught it from kissing someone, or from an adult kissing her when she was a child.  People really need to educate themselves better, 2 thirds of the people commenting for OP to stay away from this girl will have this virus and won't even know it.
"
b3p63w,"ESH. Just because he was an asshole about your leg hair doesn't mean that you are allowed to be an asshole about his beard.

I can understand that you might not like it, but talking about your issues constructively is the way to go. Sit him down, talk about what bothers you without just telling him that it looks like shit and you hate it, even if that might be the case.

Because in the end, it's his decision to keep it just like it's your decision to keep your leg hair. Maybe offer grooming it for him, if the issue is that he just thinks that taking care of it is a chore. "

b3pdg1,"YTA.

b3pmdr,"NAH - It's his money and he can spend it as he desires. I do understand your point too, but it's not your money is it?


I think it is time for you to talk finance. How come you two are living together for years but have no set of ""rules"" for things like this? How come you two don't have a savings system? If you are living together you two should work out what money goes where for what reasons. And also you two should agree on how much each partner gets to spend on themselves without consulting the other.

You two need to sit down and discuss these things, set up guidelines. Make payments automatic, set up a payment account from which everything is payed. Agree on how much each person deposits on said account. Agree on how much you save together. Agree on what to do with the rest of the money. "
b3pn9d,NTA.  I hate when people do this. Her poor planning is not your problem. She should have just let you do what you wanted to do. You shouldn’t be on the hook for bills you had a plan to avoid bc she doesn’t make good financial decisions.

b3q88g,"YTA. From a buyer's perspective, it is dishonest and unfair. When you look a place to buy, environment is a part of it, by asking to do it just for the sale, it is like covering up potential defaults to potential buyers. Same as fresh painting over mold on a wall. That's all."
b3qafw,"Unpopular opinion but I’m gonna go with YTA 

I totally understand why your gf is pissed.  I’ve worked a night shift at jobs and it sucks.  It seems like a little thing, not sleeping at the same time.   But going to bed together and waking up together can actually mean a lot to how close a couple feels, among other benefits. 

Obviously you are within your rights to want a more laid back shift but I think your gf is justified in being pissed, especially if you didn’t talk to her about it first.

b3qh61,"NTA she should be happy with what she gets, especially if it's something nice hand made by you, how much would that cost if she commissioned it? "
b3qjpr,"NAH, however, there are a few things that I feel the need to point out (My Confirmation was years ago, so my terminology may be a bit fuzzy):

1. A Roman Catholic baptism is not necessarily a profession of faith on the part of the baptized, it merely represents a willingness to explore said faith, and a commitment on the part of the godparents to help teach the neophyte about Catholicism. If baptized, your son would grow up around the Church (just as you did), but would still be free to make his own decisions when he comes of age (just as you did). We have a separate sacrament for when you're ready to join in the Eucharist, another to affirm your beliefs in front of the community (Confirmation, typically around 6-8th grade), and another still for when you've decided on your vocation. 
We have seven of these things, they cover just about every major life event you can imagine.

2. If you are not a part of the Church, and not present at the baptism, no reasonable person is going to hold you to the promises made by parents at the baptism, i.e. raising their child with an understanding of Catholic mythology. You will still be free to raise your child as you see fit when you have custody. In fact, this situation may prove beneficial, as your child will have exposure to both a theist worldview and an agnostic/athiest one, allowing him to make a more informed decision later on in life.

TL:DR: Baptism in Catholicism just means you're willing to learn, nothing more, and being raised in this split environment could actually help him when it is time for him to decide."

This couldn't be further from the truth. He's only 14, and he has zero obligation to tell his parents anything.  Yeah, hiding your sexuality for 4 years before you're out of high school and can move out fucking sucks, but as someone who did that, it's infinitely preferable to the possibility of getting kicked out (or just living with people who constantly make it clear they hate what you are) while in high school. If he truly wants to come out he can, and maybe it'll be alright! But let him know it is really really not important, that even if his parents don't know he's still gay and nothing can change that.

My guess is that it was marketed as ""$63 off"" on the website but his wife paid around $50-$60 for it.

b3ujn6,"YTA, look up sleep paralysis. It happens to some people, and they cannot move or respond. She isn't messing with you."
b3uoup,"YTA. 100% that first relationship may have been a case of bad timing (you showed up but she was already on the verge of seeing someone else etc). What you did is blatant emotional manipulation. You told this girl you loved her and then threw her away. You established a serious emotional connection and then used it against her dude. And for what? Petty spite?

Edit: typos"
b3upb0,NTA That was extremely tacky of her. I'd make it very clear that it wasn't intended to.
b3upg7,Its been 6 months.  It doesn't seem like any action is needed on your part at all.
b3uwdf,NTA. If you’re confident in your work then you know he’s trying to pick issues to pay you less/not at all. Get out of that situation. 
b3uyc7,"Hey, I think this is above this subs paygrade. If you are in an abusive situation you should definitely get out. There might be a social worker who can help you. Hopefully someone can point you in the right direction. 

I feel like r/legaladvice might have some help, but you might need something else before taking legal action to change custody.  

I guess some info is needed — how old are you? Also, is there a written custody agreement between your parents?

If you are worried about ""tattling"" or being ""childish"", you need to realize that it's really inconsiderate of those vaping to be doing it in such public areas, especially when there are health (bathrooms being polluted) and allergic (that one girl) concerns.

What's your logic here? He's never called me out for insulting him before, so I'm just going to keep doing it?

b3w2ww,"NTA. It’s not “irrational” to find the idea of moving in with a 32 year old man and his mommy and daddy unappealing. You wouldn’t be starting a new life together, you would be a plus one in the house he grew up in. "
b3w34b,"NAH

Stop overthinking this. He asked, you didn't feel like it so you said no, he didn't push the issue.

No mental gymnastics required here."
b3w3hx,"NAH.

This is a really, really tough situation, OP, and it's definitely something you guys should have talked about *much* earlier in your relationship, especially considering that you guys aren't planning to ever marry.

One of the pros of being married is that legal obligation to each other financially, unless otherwise stated *before* the marriage begins. Since you guys have decided not to get married, the two of you need to have a long and serious talk about finances and what would happen if."
b3w65u,"NAH. 

Your son might feel better if you are there, but it’s not like you are leaving him completely alone. Other family can handle him until you are done. "
b3w9yy,"NAH.

Both of you are in a challenging situation that neither of you have (probably) experienced before.

Asking him to respect your space, or to not be so pushy, is a normal and reasonable thing to do.  Be tactful and it should be fine.

He is probably trying to have a good relationship with you but isn't sure what to do.  If you are honest and tactful when you talk to him it should help you both (as long as he isn't an asshole)."
b3wcu3,"NAH.

There is a change to the dichotomy of the group. That's no big deal. People date sometimes, and sometimes those relationships end (which will also be devastating to the friend group).

Give your friends time to warm up to the idea that you are in a relationship with Alice. Also be respectful not to flaunt your new relationship--sometimes, ""sneaking"" kisses is almost worse off than openly showing affection, because you are suggesting to your friends that they should find the behavior off-putting."

They wanted the best for you, and carried that out horribly.

You took it exactly in the same way.

There isn't a right one here."
b3wmif,"NTA Dude, no. This is your dog now. They have no say of ownership anymore. They stopped paying you... the dog is yours. "
b3wrvf,ESH.  Fuck those people for not following the rules of parking.  It's certainly infuriating.  But it also doesn't seem like a great idea to set an example like that to your children.  
b3wvte,YTA.  Your dog.  Your responsibility to clean up after it.  Keep it away from bushes if you have to.
b3wykb,"YTA

The entire class is full of entitled children. You're acting out because the teacher isn't doing it how you want to. but you don't call the shots, she does. 

How do you expect this to work in the real world? Are you going to tell your boss ""fucking around is how I get shit done""? No. School prepares you for the real world. Don't act like you deserve to be entertained a certain way. "
b3x29b,"NTA.

I mean, it's not really your business, but good for you for standing up for your friend. 

Helen needs a friend like you that gives a fuck. Anxiety is a real bitch to deal with, people like Maya are assholes. 

I get it, you're all young. But she's still an asshole for the things she said to Helen. And I think you're a good friend for standing your ground on something you felt strongly about. 

It's good to stand up for your friends. 

Maya sounds like one of those girls who treats people like shit and then forgets about it until she's reminded of what a crap person she is. ""It was a year ago."" That doesn't fuckin matter. 

I wouldn't continue being friends with someone like her."
b3x38k,"NAH. You’re right about empathizing, but she wanted to vent and that’s alright too. "
b3x6r3,NTA - But I still think you should go have a good time with your other friends.

b3x7qb,"Frankly, he sounds like the asshole here. Not you. He said he wanted to keep things ""casual"", but if you guys were doing everything that couples do, and he was also getting jealous of you hanging out with other men, he was just using you.

You're dating a misogynist.

"
b3xbr7,"NTA. Your parents are arseholes for holding the money they give you over your head. That money was freely given to you on the understanding it was yours. They should not be saying that nothing you have is yours because they earned it. Well, they should have kept their money in  that case. 

They gifted it to you so legally, morally and in every other way, that money and what you purchased with it is yours. 

I really hope your sister goes on to earn a decent living and can care for them in their dotage, because I can't see their doctor daughter wanting much to do with them once you're free. "

b3xp5o,NTA. Your mother is taking advantage of you. 
b3xpkj,"NTA.

Your husband is acting really weird.  I could understand if it was some random dude, but you want to spend time with your brother.  Being alone and chilling with your brother is a perfectly normal and healthy thing to do, and it seems like your husband is being really possessive over the movie thing for some reason.  I'd talk to him and see if he thinks it's something that he thought you both thought was ""your special thing""."
b3xqh8,"NTA - Don't talk shit about people behind their backs, especially a work place and about someone who is universally liked. If he gets ratted out it's his own fault."

b3xubh,"YTA 

This is going to be controversial, but you were absolutely an asshole.  Not only to her, but to yourself.  You deprived yourself of many opportunities to find someone who you could love and would love you back, and set them aside for a fantasy that you knew wasn't likely to ever happen.  You spent how many years apart forsaking all of the opportunities in front of you for someone you hadn't talked to in how long?  

I don't think being honest about your feelings is being a huge asshole to her.  But having those feelings about a person you didn't even know any more certainly seems like an asshole move to yourself.  You were toxic and oppressive, but you've been out of her life for years, so bringing your feelings up to her doesn't seem like a huge sin to me.  The toxicity infected your life far, far more than hers."
b3xy71,">me good person?

Well let's not go overboard"
b3xyzn,"NAH. I actually feel the same, I’d rather throw money at a mortgage than rent, but if he’s not actively trying to save money then he might need to hear this "
b3y03m,"NTA.  It's your wedding, and you told them what you wanted.  He didn't comply."
b3y1by,"YTA

I completely get why this is a horrible situation for you to be in but you have to be honest with your fiance - this is the kind of thing that could tear your relationship apart further down the line if not. I know you're worried about ruining his family relationship but what his Dad did is despicable and shouldn't be ignored."

But I recommend reiterating you are only available to your original schedule.  Then if you're asked to come in other days or you're scheduled,  you can respond those are out of scope with the agreed upon schedule.  

Also,  don't feel bad saying no and don't feel like you owe an explanation either.  ""No,  I'm not available"" should suffice.  Good luck,  OP."

b3yji4,"NTA. I'd appreciate this head's up as a prof. And you didn't name names, so the prof can collect their own unbiased observations if it happens again. "
b3yjkk,NTA they need to suck it up and realise not everyone is going to like their food. I would suggest not even contacting them anymore.
b3ynna,YTA. You’re never not the asshole for cheating. Period.
b3yo5w,"NTA. To my understanding, two weeks notice is just a kindness. It's not compulsory; not like that can really punish an employee who's leaving for doing it. If its damaging your mental health, then leave. Take care of yourself first."

>**excluding me from free shots** and catching food thrown off the spatula.

that is some bullshit, wtf"
b3yxnm,"EHS- she’s an Asshole for saying something obviously rude. It also is also messed up she did not bother to take the time to acknowledge your feelings. 

BUT- You shouldn’t be displaying disordered behavior in front of your kids. The way it is worded sounds like a tantrum. Also, it is your job to make yourself happy and healthy (and her job to encourage positive behavior). 

Definitely, reiterate that what she said was rude. If you want to make changes to your health, do it in a way that might rub off well to the kids. Family walks or something. 

Your life is worth it- live happy. "
b3yyh3,NAH. Pretty petty disagreement. You both want the same thing—to not drink and drive. 
b3z16w,"NTA - there is no requirement for you to accept verbal abuse from a family member, and it sounds like her history indicates that could be a response.  Very glad your mom is supportive, and I wish you every success. <3"
b3z33k,"NAH. Since this seems to be a one-time thing, and she usually does reply to you in that situation, it would make sense that you were concerned, it would be different if there was a pattern of behavior though. "
b3z60r,NAH. I'm going to be real with you. You sound like an edgy 16 year old. At that age  people still are pretty warped about weed. Also probably should get some help. Like long term help bruh.
b3z7tb,"NAH, but you’re not a vegetarian. Meat-eating vegetarians aren’t a thing."
b3zaka,"SHP.

Why challenge what she wants in her relationship? Is she telling you what kind of relationship dynamic to have? Why bring it up? You aren’t dating her. It’s a stupid thing to argue about and you both suck for it."
b3zfk8,"YTA - since this isn't working out voluntarily, you need to get the legal system involved and work out actual dollar amounts he will provide for child support.  Then you can plan how much money you'll have and spend it on the baby guilt free.

If you just spend $200 from his account without permission, that's stealing."
b3zfmb,"NTA, but be forgiving and try not to take offence. As you already know, with a large family there is a lot of craziness going on. If anything, you should be upset with your parents for incorrectly communicating things. "
b3zh7x,[removed]
b3zhch,"NTA.  There’s something very wrong here (and it’s not that you gave him a platonic hug, or brushed his arm incidentally). 

My first instinct is that he’s trying to mindfuck you, for some wierd sadistic reason; but it could just be that he’s trying to regain what he feels like is “equal footing” with you, by manufacturing something that *you* now need to be ashamed of (to be clear, you don’t), so that he can feel better about the Great Shame of having been rejected. 

Either eventuality seems very unhealthy, though.

I’m sorry.  It’s a bit disorienting and frustrating to have a friendship break up in mid-air like this (I had something similar happen once, and I’ve never stopped fearing it’ll happen again; cause it sucks). "
b3zjag,"NTA.  You can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink. 

It sounds like your sister needs the counselor,  but if she won't go don't beat yourself up. 

"
b3znmu,"NAH at all. Such a tough situation. Can you talk with her directly about your needs and boundaries?  If not, can you meet together with her caregivers to strategize a plan?  She has to recognize that everyone involved here is part of a team so leaning too much on one member could jeopardize everyone. "
b3zo21,What do you mean by “sign out of a lease”? Typically- if you have signed a lease- it is difficult to get out of it. 
b3zprc,"NTA-

Damn, I'm sorry you're in this position. financial problems can rip apart families like nothing else. 

I dont think you're wrong for not wanting to see her, but I do understand the guilt you feel. This situation happened in my family quite a bit.

Has your mom gone to therapy? Maybe start there, if someone can help her slowly get off the meds, it might help a bit.

I wish I could give more advise but we haven't really figured out how to fix stuff like this in my family either.

Edit: I re-read the part about drugs and alcohol. Definitely start there. "
b3zr4b,NTA- What universe would you  be an asshole? They literally are not doing there job? I had a problem similar the guy would park 5 minutes down the road EVERY time and literally call me saying he didn’t know where he was almost three times a week (found out his weed dealer lived near by or something) . I’m pretty pregnant so I literally had a little freak out and did the online support thing expressing annoyance. I literally tip them like ten dollars and I live in a very very quiet suburb (no excuse) anyways I ended up getting 50 dollars in free food credit. 
b3zsq0,"NTA. I hate to say it, but you’re right. The demographic he wants to represent are going to crucify him. He asked for your advice, and you delivered. I wish your advice was incorrect, and I wish we didn’t live on this kind of world. But we do. 

Honestly, I hope he does run as an openly gay baptist. I want him to prove you wrong. Best of luck to him. "
b403pf,NTA. You're not pressuring him to do anything but follow the law and your lease agreement. Your roommate would probably be fine if there was black mold and rodents too because they don't want to cause a fuss. 
b406ky,"NTA - pick which relationship is more important to you and stick with it.

b407fv,Info why do you think YTA?
b409ix,"YTA - It's wrong to steal. However, download an app like Photoscan and just use your camera to get copies. They come out really good and don't look like a picture of a picture at all."
b40a92,NTA. Nope. Separate from the group and do your own. You shouldn’t risk your grade because of them.
b40agf,NTA NTA NTA fuck this guy. Don't let him take the kitten to the vet while you're mad at him about that specific sick kitten. That sounds like it'll end with him having the cat put down because 'it's just a cat' 
b40dev,"NAH- this is one of those situations where it felt like 5-10 seconds, but honestly it was probably a single second if you saw his cane hit the same pole that he walked into. In the time that you would have figured out what to say, he would have walked into it anyway. Even if you yelled the right thing at him it likely wouldn’t have helped because he may not have known it was directed at him in time. 

You’re also not an asshole for assuming a disabled person is capable until told otherwise- thinking a blind man needs guidance in his surroundings when he’s an adult obviously able to walk about by himself would probably feel pretty condescending for him. One of my close friends uses a wheelchair and one of his pet peeves is people hovering, asking if he needs stuff done for him. He’s like “I’m 32. I’ve figured out how to do most stuff by now”. This is a thing that really fucking sucks, but no real harm was done. "

b40g0g,"NTA There is a limit to how many dogs is a reasonable amount to own, you're not wrong there obviously. And committing to bringing in an animal, especially if you already own animals with special needs is something that should be brought up beforehand. 

I feel for you, the only thing I can say is that if you're considering ending the relationship I would have a sit down, like a family meeting sort of deal. It sounds weird but making an official meeting about your feelings helps separate this conversation from the typical arguments you may have been having. "

b40rps,"NAH- While you will always love your wife, she would probably want you to go on living your life.  You honored your agreement, did another year until you were ready.

b40xeo,"NTA.  When you asked him what you should wear, he should've said ""Anything is okay, but *I'm* gonna wear a suit"".  That wasn't fair to you, especially if he knows how uncomfortable you are if you feel underdressed for a big event "
b40xpr,"NAH I think both sides of this are completely valid though I do sympathize a bit more with your girlfriend since her view is the one I would share in this situation. You guys were together for 5 days in a row so maybe she'd thought it would be nice to ease back into normal and have one more night with you instead of going back to her cold bed all at once. But it's okay for you to want to be alone too and to miss your routine back home. In the end I think that this is about what you're more comfortable with and if it isn't staying this night with her it's okay to politely decline (politely is key here, as long as it's phrased in a way that's clear that it isn't about not wanting to sleep with her, but rather about missing being home), she likely won't be too upset over something like this or hold a grudge."

She put herself in that situation and if she didn’t have you, she would have had to get an Uber home anyway and then one back the next morning! At least if you picked her up, she might only have to pay for one uber back, or ask for a ride from you in the morning.

b426pu,"NAH - I'd be alarmed if someone spent that sort of money on me. I'd definitely call the florist and try to find out who it was. I'd be watching the people around me for any sign of weirdness or ""So, what did you get for Valentine's Day?"" Questions with even a faintly knowing tone.

Those are my flowers now and you bet I'm not throwing them out, I'm frolicking in my gorgeous perfumed jungle house and enjoying the heck out of this random windfall.

Even if they're from some creep that I hate. 

Perhaps all the more so because I don't feel guilty about them spending money because whatever, that dude sucks.

b42h4x,"NTA woah everyone that said OP is TA is wack. Cutting off contact may be the only thing that allows parents to see reason, since it completely eliminates their platform for unreasonable requests and shitty opinions. It may not be abuse, but it's 100% harassment and they as adults do NOT have to tolerate that.

Op, you do NOT owe anything to your foster parents. Sure, they took you in as if you were they're own, but that means taking on the responsibility to raise you to adulthood. After that is fair game. You go off on your own, as an adult, and may make a life for yourself with or without your foster parents (entirely up to you). Some people continue to see their foster parents, some don't.

Did he not just get a few years free accomodation in a property bigger than he can afford in a nicer area???

If you only intended to give it to her because you 'love' your ex wife then you're a bit of an asshole (ESH) for making your current girlfriend a 'plan b'. The way she reacted was a little over the top, but to be expected since you are giving money to another woman (that you used to be married to).

Otherwise, you do have kids to provide for and it's none of her business because you're not married and you don't share the money.

Just a question: did she know you had a wife when you had an affair with her? Because if she did then the whole 'disrespecting her' is a load of bullshit because she did the same thing to your ex wife.

b43thb,"NTA. The way she treated you on the day of the concert, along with the completely thoughtless gift is not best friend behaviour. I think a gift that’s not expensive can be great if there’s clearly been thought put into it, but it sounded like she just picked some stuff out of her junk drawer. Candles? Really? Might as well as have thrown some socks in too. You’re not being entitled imo, especially after shelling out a lot for a gift that was also thoughtful.

Did something change about your friendship recently? I get the sense that it has something to do with her girlfriend - I know plenty of people who have changed when they get into a relationship, sometimes for the worse.

They are abusing her. Making false reports to the cops is actually illegal, and I would file a police complaint about that.

 A PI has no authority to order you not to approach anyone. Again, I would report that behavior. Get the investigator's name. He cannot ""arrest"" you, or threaten to.

 I would be reporting them to the police for elder abuse every single time they start screaming at their mother, not for revenge, for her safety.

My husband played tackle football and there is 0 chance either of us will allow our children to play tackle football, pads or not."
b46gl9,"NAH it's not like you led her on, you were clear about the nature of the relationship from the start and tried to nip it in the bud when she started to get feelings.

She is also not the asshole for having feelings. "

I roomed with two guys just like this when it came to dishes and general cleanliness. I moved out. They paid the same as I did and I couldn’t make them do anything. Sometimes you get a great roommate, sometimes you know what you don’t want in your next one. Live and learn."

Except maybe to your family for not getting the food they wanted.

Personally, I think I'd have asked for a manager just to be sure the rules hadn't changed. Then suggested a separate ""called in order"" line - that's how a restaurant here does it.

b47k4y,"NAH. It's a shitty situation all around. You have every right not to agree with her decision, but if you want to stay in her life, you do need to be supportive to a certain extent. 

Have you ever had a real sit down with her and told you all of this? That you think she's wasting her life, could be happier, etc etc? Although, as I think you already know, once you put down all your thoughts and feelings on the table, it may very well end the friendship. 

If she is in an abusive relatinship, you could also try getting together those close to her and having an intervention (best to speak with a professional before doing this). 

Either way OP, I sincerely hope everything works out for the best. "

The situation sucks, but you are.

>he should keep his word **whether we are together or not.**

No, as soon as you're broken up, all agreements are voided. IF you were together while he was at school and you were working, and you enjoyed all the benefits of being a couple, why should he uphold his side if he can't have the benefit of being your BF? If you *weren't* together while he was at school, why were you supporting him without a clear written contract that he would do the same for you? This is poor judgement on your part and he's not obligated to uphold anything. I'd let it go.

b4d9xo,"ESH. She's a dickhead coward for ghosting you but you need to learn to take a hint. Anything but a definite ""yes"" is a pretty clear ""no,"" and women are allowed to say no. They also aren't obligated to explain themselves to you if you haven't been in a serious relationship."

>He was immediately indignant and refused to address anything I asked of him, telling me he didn't post what I saw and had nothing to do with it at all. It became very heated and he ended up storming out of the house.

This makes it sound like he was simply looking at someone else's viewpoints on something. It's very easy to stumble upon something you don't agree with, or even look at things that you dislike for curiosity's sake (like I've looked at incel communities in absolute disgust before.) 

It's even more complicated when there are a TON of people out there that discuss the morality of Islam and the hateful beliefs that are sometimes practiced within the Muslim faith. It's not uncommon at all for people to be upset or disagree with a certain practice or belief. That being said, obviously, this is no excuse to be disrespectful and absolutely hateful towards those who have a different faith than yours.

Calling him already angry with assumptions is not right, especially when you don't know what your teen is thinking, or what his intentions are. Taking his stuff away and threatening to get rid of it is dehumanizing when you still have yet to find out what he actually was up to on the forum. In the end, you immediately treated your son with extreme disrespect-- all based off of a forum page. I'd be angry too.

You should have treated your son with decency, and communicated with him about your concerns. Getting angry, yelling up a storm, threatening to throw his stuff away, and then throwing him out all based on assumptions is absolutely not the way to do things.

This is a difficult one. What she did is not ok, but there's good chance it's a result of how you described yourself to be to her for the last year or whatever.

I'm not crticising- it's great you admit to your faults, and I've been less than perfect in the past with relationships, including one when I was cheated on.

Honestly, you need to talk to her once this isn't so fresh, and prepare for the fact it might be beyond repair. I hope you resolve it though."

Your father had initially been was disappointed, yet supported your decision. Based off of his tone and language showed later on, it may be likely your father's mother convinced him that you were selfish and unruly, despite you mentioning you wanted to help lessen economic stress.

b4gkx5,"NTA-

That sucks that they’re not including you now. I’d definitely reach out to someone you feel comfortable talking with and seeing what you can do. That’s really not fair that just because you didn’t reciprocate someone’s feelings you’re suddenly not allowed in the group.

b4gsae,"ESH (except the servers)

In the U.S. waiters get paid well below minimum wage. Something like $2.75/hr last I checked.  Just a weird little twist in the law.  That's right, the restaurant owner has put the burden on you, The patron, to make sure their employees are properly paid.

Now, there is a growing trend where owners specifically say do NOT tip because we pay a living wage, so hopefully that continues.  Most foreign countries see the U.S. as strange for our system."
b4h0vy,"NTA.  It's fair to expect some compromise from your partner.  You try to stay up and do things at night with him sometimes.  He should try to get up early and do things in the morning with you sometimes.  

Also, you might both try to cut back on the drinking some, it would probably improve QoL for both of you."
b4h1ex,"NTA. I commend you for not wanting to be false. She can’t tell you all these awful things about this guy and then expect you to forget them just because she is willing to forgive. 

She sounds like a fair weather friend in that she only wants you when she is in crisis as you have pointed out. 

If you want to save the friendship then perhaps the best way of doing it is to say you can’t afford the trip because something else has come up. Alternatively just be honest but as you say that will likely end the friendship. "
b4h2mn,"NTA. But be careful, she is an adult. Tell her what you think about her bf, once. Don't drive her away from you by constantly nagging her. If you have siblings or other close relatives, contact them and talk to them. Let them know what you know and try to find a course of action for all of you that keeps your mother's well being and feelings in mind."
b4h3qk,"NTA, should have probably taken that into account when you decided to marry her. "
b4h7wp,"NTA. I understand it's your mother's house but, they really should have been respectful of other people living there. Also, they were definitely celebrating for a while, so ""cutting it short"" at 4am seems reasonable."

Bottom line, you showed him he's third in line behind your mom and sis when it comes to his own child 

The way you worded ""I decided to keep it"" also makes me think his input wasn't even a consideration

Yep, your body your choice, however that choice made you to be the asshole in my view when it comes to the question you posed

Saying ""Hey, hon, you have to subject yourself to years of having a horrible life so that we can save money. That's fine, right?"" is unfair.

Now, sure, you can restrict your range of potential spouses to guys who *want* to be stay at home dads. That would be fine, and not assholish. But saying that, regardless of his personality, he *must* be a stay at home dad just because it would cost less... yeah, that's an asshole move."

You said that you arent SILs biggest fan but you keep it under wraps but that is probably not the case at all, people can sense when someone doesnt particularly care for them.

First of all congratulations on your son!

I especially freak out when people come up behind me and touch me without warning. But you’re not going into enough explanation to make them realize you’re not just being stubborn/childish. Maybe if you know what trainers you have or a specific set of instructors (how do gyms work, lmao) you could go up to them beforehand and be like “hey, during workouts, if you need to correct my form, could you do it verbally? I have issues with physical touch”. For people you didn’t talk to beforehand or you’ve already accidentally snubbed, go up to them afterwards if possible or catch them when you can and say “hey, I’m sorry if I came off as rude earlier, I have issues with physical touch and it was a knee-jerk reaction- I just wanted to explain that it wasn’t anything against you or being corrected, just the physical contact”

After he broke up with her for the umpteenth time he came to me and disclosed that he was planning on sleeping with a girl (girl 2) we’ll known to sleep around when I relayed this to him his reply was that she told home she is a virgin and would not accept anything else. 

A few weeks go by and he returns to me, I ask him how things went with girl 2 and he told me not to tell anyone, she gave him gonorrhea and that he considered getting back together with girl 1 I told him that would be shitty and if he did to tell her and if she took him back to use protection. When girl 1 came to me because girl 1 and I are friends and I’m friends with “randy” she asked me for advice and I told her it was not a good choice but did not tell her about the STI he had gotten. 

Again after a few weeks they are back together and I hear she caught what he has (heard from mutual friends then eventually from girl 1)  it’s been a year since this and I wonder if I should have been more explicit in my warning to her and betray his trust or would it have even been a betrayal.

b4k652,NAH - you probably should be more sensitive to her emotions. 
b4kafp,"NTA but it’s just a song. Nothing has to be “paused” you can ask your DJ to put it in as part of the line up. Somewhere kind of “dead” anyway. Or you can see about dedicating a song to him and have the DJ announce “the bride and groom would like to wish ________ a very special happy birthday today” it will not distract from you at all, and will probably be something people look back on and say “awe” you can even have it done while you’re doing pictures or something like that where you’re not even in the building. But it is your day and it’s what you wish!"
b4kaz2,"NTA

IMO you were way nicer than you needed to be."
b4kbet,"YTA. The woman wanted to try to figure it out on her own which is honestly pretty noble if she had no idea what she was doing. When she finally came to you for help in a defeated state of complete frustration after 2 hours of work You told her she had a ""s****y attitude"". I would have been mad at you too. Just help her out, she's defeated."
b4kf38,YWBTA - that would be highly unprofessional of you and will reflect very poorly on you at work. Do not question it. The budget for these awards may have gone down this quarter for all you know. 
b4klre,NTA. You were young and didn't know how to respond. I am so glad your boyfriend had your back. 
b4knm4,"NTA- shit a LAN party is one of the least controversial guy day activities I can think of.  Of the list of guy day activities that cause conflict, that seems like it should be WAY at the bottom. Along with like collecting stamps . She needs to learn to be ok with you having guy time. 

Edit, I say this knowing my husband would never take his computer (read baby and favorite child lol) out of the house. "
b4kpvg,"NTA they are collectables not toys for her to play with. 
Does your sister know the value of the stuff?"
b4kqev,NTA IF you agree to pay full market price for the home.  Then the money from the sale would still be the same amount going to the same people.

b4kv3b,Info did you back out one month from the trip after knowing about it for a good year or so?
b4kvkj,"NTA, if it was just that one comment and she stopped it would have been fine. You asked her to stop and she agreed, but she still continued, that is quite disrespectful. Perhaps give her a friendly reminder? Maybe she just forgot about your agreement. "
b4kvwl,"NTA. And if they refuse to pay it and you have texts that have proof, you might be venturing into r/legaladvice territory because that’s not a small sum of money for many people "
b4kz4d,"NTA. Restaurants should notify late arrivals about closing time and the time they stop serving food, in a polite manner. If they can't be nice about it, then they should stop admitting people until a certain time before closing. "

b4lvy3,"NTA.  You're better off spending that $80 on a day trip with your kids and taking phone photos of them actually having fun.  Unless your kids are hilarious during these photos and you want to save them for some r/blunderyears type of reason, there's no real reason that you need school sanctioned photos."
b4lwwr,"NTA.

You’re pregnant and near your due date, that should be his priority at the moment and not going out for a drink. "
b4lzv6,"YTA to me personally. It’s pretty crazy to me that you get paid to keep your own home clean in the first place. I can understand being paid for the babysitting as that shouldn’t be your responsibility per se, but you are being paid to do basic chores in your own home which you do not even pay rent for. Your dad sounds like an extremely generous person already and I feel like you would just be taking advantage to ask for more. "
b4m0a6,"NTA

That was a shit move your mother pulled thankfully your boss is understanding. "
b4m0ud,"NTA - I mean, really, it's your car. Your decision. "
b4m1m7,[deleted]
b4m7a4,"YTA. 

If you want your food to be grilled, it will be cross contaminated with animal product regardless of whether you can see or perceive it or not. 

Grills in a restaurant are cooking multiple, multiple dishes at once. Burgers for this customer, steaks for that, etc etc etc. it’s all well organized and they don’t cook one customer’s food at a time on a grill. 

Asking for it to be cooked in a separate pan is fine. Asking them to stop usage of the grill to clean it for you and then only cook your food on it until it’s done, is absolutely ridiculous. "
b4m880,"NTA , definitely not. If you’re busy and they haven’t booked it yet. I can’t see the reason they can’t move it to another time! "
b4mdjl,"NTA, you don't have to like someone if they are annoying. There's probably people with autism you would like but you just don't like him. You don't not like him because he's autistic, you don't like him because he's annoying."

b4mic5,"Dude has a right to know purely for health reasons. STD's are not a joke. Unless you know she's being a safe cheater(term used loosely), tell him. 

This often comes up on /r/amitheasshole. Health takes precedent over friendship. 

You are NTA. 

Your GF being friends with the girl in question complicates things. Let's reverse the question, your GF is cheating on you. Do you want to know? Do you want to get tested? You should. Remove the hypothetical, your buddy has thw right to get tested. How You bring it up...is a matter of sensitive delivery. Be nice. Be a bro but start talking. "
b4mk4p,[deleted]
b4mljl,"NTA, just send a final message saying you need payment within 24 hours or access will be pulled.  All your friends held up their end of the bargain and there is no reason she should be exempt.  If you get any kind of message that it's small and petty.  Just say it's principle, no free rides in this world."
b4mu0u,NAH. He hasn't actually said anything to you so I won't call him an asshole yet with regards to that but he was pretty clear and almost a bit demeaning in the way he signaled to you that he wasn't that upset about it not working out. Four dates with no intimacy does not a serious relationship make. Good luck with the dates and try not to get too angry with him until he actually says something or is rude to her or something tangible to that effect. He may need to process how he feels about it for a little bit but you should not feel bad at all that you're having a great time with her.
b4mw4u,[deleted]
b4n1hq,"NTA. As far as interactions with children go, you're fully vaccinated, and if he's expecting contact that could spread HPV, he's got bigger problems. Best case, he's an aggressive idiot, at least in this situation. "
b4n2ms,NTA. The dude should have let you recline. Idk if this is an unpopular opinion or not but I believe that anyone at anytime can recline their seat on a flight.  I feel as though this topic gets brought up a lot on this sub. 
b4n3hy,"NTA. Helping a younger sibling with stuff like this can be really rewarding and I plan on encouraging my hypothetical children to be involved with each other's academic work. However, it sounds like your compromise is reasonable and that you want him to take some responsibility for these things."
b4n6xe,"NTA, in fact, good on you for sticking up for your siblings! I always find it nice when my little brother sticks up for me when my mom is being unreasonable and I always stick up for him. "
b4n837,NTA. You don’t owe anyone your friendship or emotional labour. Maybe it’s best for you and your friend to respectfully grow apart.  
b4ndw3,NTA that's nasty
b4ne11,"I'm gonna have to say NAH. 

You might think OP is an asshole, but the way he stated his post meant that K only found out he had cancer the day that he had been fired, and did not state that he did until after the meeting in which he was terminated. He did not mention if he had been feeling sick, and OP had every right to assume he was skipping. 

Should OP have re-instated him with a warning not to be late? Maybe. But it is kinda of K's fake for not speaking up. "
b4nhcf,"NTA, really rough situation, hang in there kid you can make it through this."
b4nhf0,Forgetting stuff when you’re mad dosen’t excuse your behavior
b4niej,"NTA. It might be a good idea to explain that you just told him to be careful, but no, you don't owe anybody an apology."
b4nknn,"NTA- but I would be casual if she actually called the apartment. They sent out pest control asap when bedbugs are mentioned. If the infestation gets too bad, they can have issues getting them out even after she leaves. She may have down played it to the apartment. I would have her call again and say it's bad. Someone can come out sooner in most cases."
b4nok2,"NTA. Your girlfriend lied to you, and I think anyone would be upset by this. However, it’s not healthy to deal with it through “being a dick to her.” It won’t solve anything. Have an honest conversation about it, and based off of that, decide whether or not you’d like to continue the relationship."
b4nukk,"NTA seems like he's being pretty pissy, I wouldn't have given him anything either. Maybe try to talk to him about his change in behaviour and see if there's a reason for it"
b4nvoa,"YTA. That's creepy and you made her uncomfortable. Telling her that she is so beautiful that you dreamed about fucking her beautiful body and dreamed of her tits is nasty to say to a friend, and she clearly isn't the asshole her."
b4nyk5,"NTA 

It's your relationship and you and your wife have had that understanding for a long time. Your friend is being an asshole in not understanding you, and (at least to me) it sounds likes he's trying to be controlling of your relationship with your wife"
b4nz5t,YTA- imagine not being flexible enough to let your significant other be able to live his own life in regards to a sick relative and then his sister visiting cause she lives far away and then turning and giving an ultimatum because you believe you hold importance over everything else in his life
b4nzqy,"NTA if you asked the person and they really are okay with it. Part of being an alcoholic is learning to be around alcohol so as long as they are ready for that, it would work. "
b4o0bw,"NTA - Clear communication skills is a huge requirement for learning. Not all students excel at reding a textbook and reproducing the results; some have to be explained to in a way that is different to how its set out in the text. 

I would speak to your year level coordinator about your concerns. If all your doing is reading from the textbook to learn, highlight that you may need additional learning resources to ensure the information is available. 

Of course, if the teachers English is fine but the accent is the struggle then you're being arseholish."
b4o0dq,NTA. Don’t worry about what other think about it and go about your business 
b4o2do,"ESH

I used to have a pretty low opinion of picky eaters. However I discovered over time that being a picky eater is usually related to a lot of food anxieties and forcing people to confront them has a bad backlash effect. Fancy restaurants are extremely intimidating for picky eaters so it seems like she felt miserable and alienated and anxious - which is why she was asking other people to talk to the server for her. 

However, she still behaved badly, and your snapping at her worsened an already bad situation. Nobody behaved well and tough love will probably make her dig in her heels more. I totally get why you're pissed off and I'd be furious in your shoes though. 

If there's ever a situation like this in the future, have someone call ahead, and explain the food anxieties. Even if the chef rolls his eyes, it's nothing for the kitchen to whip up a grilled cheese or whatever so she feels comfortable and everyone has a good time. "
b4o307,"NTA - Some people struggle with having to wipe their own asses in life.  Then, want to be offended when met with having it pointed out that they aren't taking care or their shit.  Honestly, moving will be a better option for your sanity anyway.  GTFO of there and enjoy your clean new space"
b4o6ds,NTA your therapist said not to make it a chore. Changing a tire is a chore. That’s not even remotely a date. 
b4o6yk,NTA - That was probably a crackhead. You didn’t do anything wrong.  (From nyc myself)
b4obdf,Find another priest. Neither of those things are required
b4oe5w,"YTA

>She did not explicitly state anything about me not going through all of it when we weren't together, so I figure she just assumed I would, but I honestly have not whatsoever.

Lol she didnt explicitly ask me to respect her privacy so I figured she just assumed I wouldn't..."
b4ohtf,[deleted]
b4ojyu,"NAH - Boundaries and personal space is important. 


If you’re worn out after a long day working with people, there’s nothing wrong with wanting to spend some time alone to decompress.


While it doesn’t sound like they are communicating in the best way, your family values your time with them. Nothing is forever, and one day these family members may no longer be around to pester you to spend time with them. It couldn’t hurt to spend what small amount of time that you can afford with them."
b4okvc,[deleted]
b4ot1h,"ESH. 7 year olds don’t rsvp, their parents do. So the kids who showed up and didn’t get a goody bag have no idea why other kids received a bag but they didn’t. The parents of the kids should have rsvp’d. You could have had some extras on hand, as every kids party I have ever thrown always has had kids who show up although their parents didn’t rsvp."
b4ou9g,"
ignore him completely. he would have asked you for it years ago if he actually wanted or needed it. this is just an excuse for him to get back in contact with you. "
b4ow0c,NAH you don't need an excuse not to date anyone. This is silly.
b4ozbu,"NTA. Cold calling is only for certain people, and very much not for other people. I almost had a nervous breakdown doing it with fundraising. You gave it a good try and length of time I think but it's not only that you were bad at it but it sounds like it was really a shitty time. Six months is more than enough to figure out it's not going to get better."
b4p0iv,"YTA

Your boyfriend is very understanding and realizes that you have anxiety, but he's right: it isn't ok for you to go through his messages without his permission. You said you were in therapy; are they talking to you about mindfulness? If not, I recommend asking about it and if they can teach you some techniques for how to be mindful of your thoughts and actions."
b4p3rj,"NTA, you're co-parenting.

Your GF is insecure.  Either work with her to figure out how to make her feel less threatened by you having a good relationship with your co-parent, or find someone who understands how important that relationship is for your kid."
b4p7kk,"NTA, rules were set for a reason."
b4pagf,"NTA

She was THINKING about it first? Are you a mind reader and forgot to include that in your post? "
b4pard,"NAH, except that she doesn’t ask about your life when you do talk. That’s definitely an asshole move. But in general, this sounds like the classic “different life stages” issue. It sucks, but it’s no one’s fault and it’s a difficult gap to bridge for even the strongest friendships. It’s absolutely valid that you feel left behind during her early motherhood but it’s also absolutely valid that her friendships are a lower priority right now. And long-distance friendship on top of that? So much harder!

I hope you guys can get a new normal when she has more flexibility or wherewithal. But you’re not wrong to pull away in the meantime.

(Also the Instagram thing? SAHM’s spend nearly 24/7 with their kid. Boring as it sounds, we don’t have much else to take pictures of all that often. Sorry!)"
b4pbgz,[deleted]
b4phmd,"NTA.

Some people don't deserve to say goodbye, i'm very sorry for your mother, may she rest in peace knowing you kept her in mind and heart throughout every action.

Take care❤️"
b4ppz8,"YTA. And I don't want that to sound too harsh because you seem to already know the answer, but there it is.

People have sex. That's just the way it is. Asking them to keep it down and be respectful is one thing, but forbidding people who pay their share of rent to have sex when you're there isn't right. Get some noise canceling headphones and suck it up. This is part of life and college."
b4pquc,"ESH, 15 days is too short for a 5 year repercussion. They suck for doing that. You just gotta deal with it the time being. But if the debt goes too high for you to pay, then just give them hell over the phone or something and they’ll give in (maybe)."
b4psom,"NAH

But, you should have let friend handle it on their own and not gotten involved.

Friend just wanted to vent to you about it, and was not asking you to fix it.

Unless someone asks you to help them, they usually just want to talk about it to express their frustrations."
b4ptbo,"I get your motivation, I really do, it sucks to watch people you care about get suckered into MLMs and other such schemes. But when you bring it up in a group setting like that, they are likely to feel attacked and sometimes that will backfire by making them double down so that they can prove everyone wrong.

You seem like a good friend that just went about communicating this in a not-so-tactful way. I hope you can sort things out with your buddy individually (which it sounds like you'll try to, good on you) and that he sees the scheme for what it is."
b4px2u,"NTA! 
You, as a couple, get to decide who comes to your wedding. FIL burned that bridge kicking his son out. Tell all of those people to pound sand"
b4px4w,"NTA Your sister sounds like she's jealous of you and insecure. It sounds like she's been bullying you a good portion of your life and you finally snapped. You're only human, it's understandable. Your mom just happened to be close by when you did and your sister got punished. That's not on you. "
b4pzn3,NTA.  Your wife is being unreasonable about this.
b4q2w0,NTA but the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different outcomes. 
b4q9od,"NTA. If cheaters don't want to get in trouble, they shouldn't cheat. "
b4qcth,"NTA. They need to do their jobs- Grace is their child and THEY owe it to her, not you."
b4qdge,"Nah 
You're not an asshole for wanting to see them. However they're not assholes for only wanting to/not being able to attend both. So basically you need to figure out which of these means the most to you and say that if they're only able to attend one event it would mean a lot to you that they come to x event."
b4qfxg,NAH. Tell his mom; he sounds like he's having some difficulties and you'd be a good friend to try and get him some help.
b4qh2h,NTA. A 20 year old man wanting to befriend a 14 year old does not have good intentions. 
b4qovz,"NAH- He didn’t want you to use his personal computer and has a right to his privacy  and you didn’t think any harm would come of it and were acting innocently without the intent  of snooping. So no assholes here! 

But in my opinion based on past relationships and my friends past relationships thats really fishy to me. I’m not including that in my judgment because I obviously don’t know the inner workings of your relationship just a little bit of advice. "
b4qpk0,"YTA.  Don't drop hints, ask him to go with you.  

And he's not sitting with his new friends.  He's genuinely becoming interested in something you like.  That's a good thing."
b4qrck,ESH.  But as a dad of three boys it sounds about right.  I would expect nothing less.  It’s extremely suspicious when my kids aren’t being assholes to each other.   
b4qtpx,NTA.  Lol I was gonna ask what her gay son thought about the whole situation til I read that last part.  Yeet the whole family and don't look back.
b4qur6,"NTA It’s not your house, any changes should be run by your mom. The fact she still comes and stays there really hammers it home, she needs a place to stay. You can’t be putting her on the coach. "
b4qv9e,"NTA - There are huge liability issues here. The kid falling on one of your kid's toys and breaking his/her arm? Lawsuit! 

Nope. This is seriously ridiculous. Get the uninvited kid off your yard. "
b4qxtn,"YTA, but only slightly. Your mom sounds kind of like a typical person, where they’re somewhat judgmental of other people and don’t like being criticized.  It’s not a set of great characteristics, but is pretty typically human. 

It seems silly to *dislike* your mother due to exhibiting somewhat obnoxious but typical human flaws. She’s a normal person. I think it would benefit you to realize she’s a flawed person and accept it for what it is. After all, you said she’s otherwise a great mom. Maybe you’ve gotten the idea in your head that she should be a perfect person because she’s a mother, and that’s generally not how it works. 

She’s a flawed human. And that’s okay. You probably have flaws, too. 

"
b4qyhw,"YTA

You ruined this girl's career at your place of work for no reason."
b4qyyw,"NTA. If a man had daily sex for 6 months without having an orgasm, nobody would call him an asshole for not handling it perfectly. People act like women's orgasms are an optional part of sex and that isn't acceptable. You didn't handle it in the best way, but like I said, show me ONE man who would handle 6 months of sex with no orgasm with perfect dignity. Your husband needs to put in an effort and stop being childish."
b4qz08,"YTA, dude. Don’t control your girlfriend because of your insecurities. If she competes at the university level, don’t quash her dreams. It’s a routine, not an invitation for sex for every man in the audience. You’re being ridiculous. "
b4qztt,NTA.  Are you in your late teens?  This just sounds like growing pains.
b4r0h4,"NTA but maybe a bit too detailed a report. “Yep, prayers and reading.”"
b4r31w,"NTA, and what the hell, she'll leave and do it anyways!?! You'll lose her?!?! What about her losing you? What about you two being a team, a partnership? This is her body, of course, but this 100% effects not just her and you, but your children. And as stated, your future child. And all for someone she just met? What is she thinking?!"

b4r6d4,"At no point have either of them apologized in the past 3 years or shown any remorse for what they have done, they specifically requested to see me at lunch. As for fighting there have been multiple phone calls between me and my mum telling her this was a bad idea needless to say tensions have been high, and as for what they are known to do, they employed my mother in their cafe for 2 years prior for significantly under minimum wage, and convinced my mum she wasn't good enough to follow her dream career to keep her there. Sorry for not including all this I meant to included it but my phone decided to post before I could finish it all "
b4r8b9,ESH verging on YTA. What she did was incredibly rude especially if this is a long term girlfriend. (Luckily your gf didn't hear) but you fought fire with a flamethrower and went WAY too far. 
b4r8s5,NAH You may have taken it a bit far but all in all you were just concerned about her. It's important not to accuse someone of ignoring you because you never know what they are going through and I think that's an important lesson to learn from this. Although she probs could have gave you a heads up. Tell her your there for her and hope she's doing okay then give her a little time and space to heal
b4raew,"NTA- a dude lying in my bed telling me how beautiful other women are and breaking off plans with me to go hang with them is a dude who can gtfo of my bed. 

Caveat is that if he is otherwise respectful and you don’t think he cheating, it’s really a matter of caring about your feelings. I wouldn’t disrespect my SO by treating him like that and no matter how innocent, he would lose his shit. Cause it’s not cool. "

b4rhhc,"NTA. 

You are the manager, and he is the assistant. He needs to learn how to show some respect. In my opinion, you should fire him now. He should be listening to his superiors.

Your step dad does not sound very understanding or respectful of the issues you deal with on a daily basis however you have to remember this is a child who doesn't know any better. It's okay to be mad at him for things but don't be mad at your sister for doing things she doesn't know is wrong "
b4rshd,"Nta because it was an accident. There's nothing wrong with being gay/bi/whatever and there's nothing wrong with wanting your family to know, even if only subconsciously.

It would be different if you went there thinking, ""I can't wait to ruin these Christians' holidays. They've ruined my gay life for the last time!"" Then you'd be the asshole.

But, in this case, you innocently blurted out your feelings, your happy lovey feelings that filled you with so much joy that you couldn't keep it to yourself. That doesn't make you an asshole. It makes you lucky to have that. So smile 😀

And, there does exist a world where their reaction doesn't make them assholes, either. Idk their story, but it is possible.

Anyway, you're not the asshole."
b4rxe3,"NTA. I’m tempted to put NAH but it is kind of rude he has just disappeared for the last five hours. Overall it seems like alcohol and emotions are going to fuel the fighting if this becomes a problem.

b4sc9o,[deleted]
b4scqy,"NTA.

You’re not a cheater, especially because you weren’t even sure that he still liked you then. If he would believe that you really cheated on him by doing that, then I wouldn’t even tell him. That’s just too much of a headache for nothing."
b4sg7o,"NTA. It’s a joke and if you can’t laugh about homosexual interspecies scissoring, I don’t wanna be on this planet anymore. "
b4shzu,NTA. For obvious reasons.
b4sim0,"ESH.  Your ex for obvious reason and you because you're threatening him with something you can't do.  That's up to the court, not you if he has parental rights."
b4slk3,NTA - Those should have been gone a long time ago. They shouldn’t need those if they’re happily with you.
b4sqdq,"NTA - yet. Maybe you never will be. But please, please, PLEASE consult with multiple vets. Reddit can never take the place of a veterinarian who can examine your cat in person. 

Not all vets are great at listening to humans. Find one who will listen to your (very valid) concerns, but you also feel good about examining your cat.

Best wishes as you navigate this."
b4sqkv,"Do you want to date one of these people? If yes, YTA. Figure out who you like as a boyfriend, and break it to the other you're not intrested "
b4svh4,"YTA. I don't really care if someone likes PewDiePie or not but, just, read what you just wrote. 
""Not denouncing the extreme alt right people who like his videos"" ""all the nazi jokes he made"" ""saying the n word on stream"" I'm just curious about what in your opinion makes someone a racist if those things dont. If you wanna watch PewDiePie fine but don't try and pretend that he hasn't said and done some really awful racist shit. And don't get upset when someone thinks you might be a racist for happily supporting him despite that behaviour "
b4svqd,"NTA

He’s trying to shame you into doing what he wants. He’s acting like a child- instead of working to get to solve the problem, he’s complaining about the symptoms. "

I'm not understanding, you took a video recording of the fan playing guitar, and now that fan is upset that your video is more popular than his?  


Even then I think it's NTA, he DID say it was alright, as long as you still credit him in the description"
b4t1wd,"YTA. Supporting businesses owned by POC is important, esp. because they're so much more likely to be small businesses and businesses barely making it. Do you have a problem specifically supporting women owned businesses, or is it just race? Because something says you only care about POC supporting each other.

Saying that something is white owned isn't at all the same is saying it's black owned. You have access to the internet, google power relations lmao."
b4t2pj,"Nta. 
Tip is up to you. If you felt you got two dollars worth of service than that’s what he gets. 
Now he is the asshole. Giving you shit about the amount. I’m with you on this one. "
b4t2v1,"NAH they don't know you are uncomfortable because you haven't said. If they did, they would probably stop. But please realize this is part of their normal lives they may not be able to speak to others about because of those perceptions of periods. Aka. be respectful when asking. They are under no obligation to care. "
b4t43q,"NAH Maybe I'm the minority, but I think that physical attraction can be necessary in a relationship. It isn't as important as what's inside, but it still matters. You aren't shallow for valuing it. Shallow would be physical attraction being the only thing that you consider. Everyone is different, and if physical attraction is one of the things you need, then that's the way it is. You can't fix that, and you shouldn't.

But you need to reconcile this in your mind before moving forward with the relationship. "
b4t5vt,"NTA the host was making you feel guilty for no apparent reason, host is an asshole"
b4t6mv,"ESH them for not telling you to quit with the drama and you for not pissing off away from them when you wanted to . They dont like you , you wanted to stay away from them but ye done nothing , either shit or get off the pot."
b4t7ot,"NTA. First of all, ""we didn't want to snip his vocal chords,"" uh, who the fuck does that? Who the fuck considers that?! Indoor/outdoor cats in a busy area and you are just begging to have your cat get run over.  Plus, put a fucking collar on your cat if it's indoor/outdoor. They're like $6.

You did the right thing. "
b4t7un,ESH - This isn’t a very healthy relationship. Why are you wasting each other’s time? The damage has been done. He may be great for the next person he dates. But he’s already poked too many holes in this relationship. 
b4tdui,"ESH, and it’s just going to take compromise from one or both of you in the future to avoid these arguments. 

You’re TA because you know how she prefers it done, but did it otherwise intentionally. It was a nice gesture to clean up, and I’m sure she does appreciate the thought, but you have to realize that it’s something important to her the way she does things. 

She’s TA because despite her *quirkiness* (as my family refers to my weird habits) she should’ve taken the time to stop and thank you for cleaning up. 

I’m the same way with certain things. My closet, for instance, is color coordinated in a very specific manner. My sister did my laundry once, and just threw the clothes in the closet Willy-nilly. I know she meant well, but it caused me a lot of anxiety at that time, and I couldn’t see past that to just be happy that she did something nice for me. (Which was shitty, and totally made me TA at that time.) "
b4tetv,"NTA
It's your decision whom you want to hang out with. Your friend should have honestly let it go when you said no and shouldn't have told his friend about your depression- because it's not his story to tell. 
Hope you get better 🌸"
b4tl3s,YTA- this is controlling and fucking gross. You don’t “allow” her to drink with her friends?? Are you /kidding me/? She should NOT marry you. 
b4tm8u,Yes. Any risk is still a risk. YTA because you’re keeping literally a transmissible chronic infection from him. 
b4twly,NTA you did your best to help someone regardless of the  consequences which is something I wish people did more often in our world
b4u2ym,"I think YTA. Depression and suicide aren’t really something to be kept to ourselves. It sounds like your friend was genuinely worried about you, and actually took steps to make sure you were okay. It’s rare to have friends that actually do something. 
I understand that it may feel like a violation of trust, but your friend REALLY was doing the right thing. "
b4u6i2,"NTA

This seems like a kind of ridiculous manifestation of a deeper issue. I assume you've discussed the above with her? Has she told you what exactly it is about you not posting that makes her uncomfortable?"
b4u7wa,"NTA, the timing is horrible but it sounds like he's absolutely horrible as well. Learn to take care of yourself, you dont have to take the shit he does and says to you."
b4udcv,"NTA 'you should be happy I came' sounds so awful, he got his head too far up his own ass to see how its a bad move towards you"
b4uq7u,"Kinda YTA for being shallow. There's so many importaint things that make a relationship, and not giving head would be your deal breaker. "
b4uske,"Your relationship is only 10 days old? If she can't handle that break up... then it's beyond you. It sounds like you should let her go because it can only get much worse. Idk man, ESH. "
b4ut3x,"NTA.

Bitch be crazy. Bullet dodged. "
b4utux,"NAH

by the sounds of it her boyfriend is emotionally abusing her, and so it’s understandable she wouldn’t want him to know but also needs someone to talk to because her boyfriend sounds like an insecure and horrible person

But at the same time I can understand you being frustrated by this, having to be hidden usually makes it seem like they view it as embarrassing being friends with you (although as I said it’s actually more because her boyfriend is being a horrible person to her in this scenario)"
b4uwj3,"NAH - you had no choice, but the lady didn’t know that, she understandably just thought you were being a d**k using the ladies! No harm done, don’t worry about it! "
b4ux95,"NTA your DH needs a reality check!  His behaviour is kind of pathetic and it’s almost as if he’s doing that trick to pretend he’s pathetic so you will just do it yourself as it’s easier.

My ex husband was like this.  Emphasis on ex.  All that grumbling and bs and ‘one’ attempt at getting baby to sleep and giving up :0 oh my goodness!!!

My current husband, when i needed to study, took all our kids and cleans the house while i locked myself in the study (older kids = mobility to find me lol).  Whilst he had them he would clean the house and prep dinner for him to cook later.  He would also do the night shift with any babies the night prior so i had a clear head to do what i needed to do rather than collapse in a heap. THIS is partnership.  

You are absolutely NTA for being pissed off that you are not getting support in this partnership."
b4uy0f,"NTA.  I have a neighbour who likes to drink and party into the early hours fairly frequently, I've never given them shit about this just ignored them and got on with it.  Until one time she decided to start banging on the connecting wall because my kid was crying late at night.  After that, she got the same treatment if her noise was pissing me off.  You can't expect silence from everyone else if you're not going to have the same level of consideration."
b4v4cy,"NTA. While noble of you to help, it is not your responsibility. If it all falls apart and they lose the house, what would happen? Could you live with that? If so, move out. "
b4v6ho,"Your old man just wants some quality time with you, throw him a bone. You’ll find a job, it is fine. Disclose away, as a weekend trip a month from now wouldn’t sway my hiring decisions whatsoever. "
b4v9gd,"NTA.

If you have concerns about your MIL feeding your dog chocolate, then don’t put yourself in that position where you have to worry about it. At least if your dog stays in kennels while you’re on holiday you know it’ll be taken care of correctly. "
b4vacu,"Yta. He might’ve been mocking you, but spitting in someone’s face is a douche move. Also doesn’t seem justified given the circumstances, just spite and an old grudge. "
b4vam2,"YTA - supporting assholes is an asshole move, sorry"
b4vc6m,NTA. Dude is picking fights
b4vfsw,"YTA break up entirely or leave other girls alone.

what kind of fuck up is this even. "
b4viaf,"NTA, that sucks that he wasn’t there for you I’m sorry, and you still tried to mend the relationship for your mom. At the end of the day, it’s the parents job if they really wants to be in their child’s life"
b4vld3,"NTA, not at all.

Your mom sounds like a textbook narcissist, and she is 100% gaslighting you. I'd head over to r/raisedbynarcissists if I were you"

b4vqsk,NAH. You are right-as long as you and clothes are clean. She’s right- much of society might question this and wonder why. 
b4vs6r,"YTA. Flying sucks for everyone - she payed for a seat that reclines, she gets to recline. If you’re tall and want a seat with more legroom, you pay for a seat with more legroom. "
b4vsb3,YTA.  You're not the parent.   If she was being physically abused I'd commend you but she's just having sex with her boyfriend.  Why do you care so much?
b4vsyt,"SHP


Usually these posts by young kids annoy me, but I like this one. It reminds me of when I used to play Minecraft in middle school. Good times. 

Anyways, if this is real, then ESH here. You're dumb kids, just have fun and enjoy yourselves. "
b4vuh4,"> I will just shift myself a little bit, forcing her to wake up.

I read this a little too fast"
b4vzm4,"""I don't care that you broke your elbow"""
b4w7d3,"NTA 

You put your safety first and that was the correct thing. Neither man seemed injured or in trouble from your explanation so you did exactly the correct thing. Don’t feel bad at all. "
b4w7pc,NTA - You have the right to set boundaries for your own home and mental health in general.
b4wezf,nta. if you wanna go the extra mile just give your sister a heads up 
b4whvg,">  Cancel culture is vicious and is unlikely to make her reflect on her actions.

You're right. Even though, I can't give two shits about her being a good person, but she does deserve a chance to be a better one nevertheless. Thanks for your judgement."
b4wir1,"NAH - Yes it's a little rude but it's a valid reason, helping your drunk father is more important than a date you could resume in 15 minutes. But she was fine for leaving, the amount of people who pull the sort of stuff you did with a fake reason is pretty high so she likely assumed you were standing her up. "
b4wki4,"ESH. He may be rude but your actions aren’t much better, even if you were frustrated with him"
b4wl53,NAH. Just be kind but firm. Stick to the work related excuse. 
b4wmxb,"YTA

It's her job."
b4wnft,"NTA for wanting space to recharge and take care of yourself. But part of a relationship is being there for each other. If you continue to avoid him I can see strains occurring on your relationship. So NTA, but talk to your boyfriend."
b4wnlw,"I'm going to call this a SHP, as you are quite obviously NTA here.  Your husband was more than accommodating for years (albeit a bit dumb in his decisions with her) and maybe getting the rug pulled out from under her will do her some good."
b4wo48,"NTA, if anything your friends/roommates should be aware and cognizant of your preference, whether religious or just by want. Seeing as this is serious to you, being religious, they should’ve honored your wishes. You even got them extra plates and completely separate utensils. "
b4wrsi,"NTA - you've got a sweet arrangement and it's nice that you do that for her, but it's really only benefitting her and you're absolutely allowed to back out of it at any time seeing as it's a favor."
b4wt1x,NTA sounds like she is using you. I see no reason why she shouldn't chip in on the bills. 
b4wvh3,NTA. Jobs are just jobs. They pay you to be there. If the job no longer serves your needs it’s your right to quit. If you no longer served their needs they’d fire you without remorse. Get it?
b4ww5t,"NAH - You can't help the way you feel about someone and you certainly can't control what her boyfriend said, although naturally you'll feel bad since she's your friend. No need to tell her unless she asks. That's water under the bridge now and it wouldn't do her any good. Sorry about your loss."
b4wy56,"YTA. Dude, when you borrow something and wreck it, you should offer to pay for it. Doesn’t *matter if they have small kids or not."
b4wy7h,[deleted]
b4wyl2,"NTA, but you also are not her authority. You don't get to tell her who she can or cannot spend time with. You can say it makes you uncomfortable, and clearly explain why, but you cannot control another person. I agree, he does not sound sweet so much as calculating. But all you can do is explain."
b4wz4m,"NTA. The gender of the friend is irrelevant; if he had missed your game, which is important to you, for a male friend, he would still be an AH. "
b4x4m6,NTA but you had a fight coming with the antagonizing way you responded. I would also be upset at the suggestion because it would carry a lot of meaning to me. Try to calmly explain your feelings while also not making her out to be the bad guy.
b4x7fl,"NTA - she sounds very manipulative, using her “insecurities” as an excuse for her mistakes and wrongdoings."
b4x7sr,"NTA I mean the tip reflects your experience, so if you had a shitty experience you seem okay to give a shitty tip"
b4x914,"NTA. Even if your mother wasn't abusive, it's still not your responsibility to have that kind of relationship with her. I have good relationships with my both my parents but I only open up to my mom. It's just that my dad isn't helpful in that way. Opening up to a loved one is supposed to be a process that helps you deal with your issues. It's not an obligation necessarily if you end up feeling actually worse after opening up. I wish you good luck in finding some professional help in the future because it sounds like it could be really helpful for you. Stay away from the hypno friend too."
b4x97f,"NAH. I understand why you’d want to keep the dog, but she’s right. The dog will have a much happier life if he’s not constantly left alone all day . Maybe you could pick him up for some weekend walks? "
b4xc0v,NTA. There's a difference in being around someone with no ambition and someone who is just a leech. 
b4xc4b,"YTA you just told someone that their opinion doesn't matter because of their sexual orientation. That's the exact thing you're trying to help these kids stand against. The dude might be ignorant, bigotted, or an asshole himself, but the moment you told him he had no right to an opinion you crossed a line."
b4xehe,"SHP. You can think its weird or disgusting though and bring it up to her but seriously, don't tell a grown adult what snacks they can or can't eat. "
b4xfj1,"NTA. It sounds like he's dependent on it (which is different than being addicted technically but I digress) and that he's not very happy and that your relationship is suffering because you can't do things together. I would imagine the heavy weed usage is more of a symptom of a problem then a cause, but I admit that I'm projecting based off my previous experience of being a person who smoked a lot of weed in order to self-medicate my undiagnosed problems. Something is up here and you're noticing a change, so I don't think you're wrong for being concerned, but the framing of it being about the weed usage may not be the most productive since you also use a lot of it."
b4xjm4,[deleted]
b4xnui,"NAH. Assuming you're telling the truth about it being a universal thing you don't do on the first date then no, you're fine for having that boundary. However, he is bound to be sensitive about it because it's probably a problem he's encountered before."
b4xpvz,"YTA - It was a fair question, and you just blatantly assumed he was going to try going in bareback. If he had asked “mind if we skip the condom?” I might be more inclined to call him the asshole. "
b4xqkb,"NTA, the kids parents sound like pricks, no wonder the kids don’t give a fuck. Should have chucked the ball at the dads head "
b4xsnk,NTA.  You're allowed to have different interests.  You should probably try to support him occasionally though.
b4xtyz,"YTA. 

It’s not like she brought over 10 people to throw a rager while you were away, she had one friend over to help move stuff, and again just to chill. Do you not trust her there alone? Do you have a problem with her friend(s)? 

It sounds like this shared apartment is the one that she considers to be her home, and certain liberties come along with that - I don’t think she should have to submit a request a month prior for every time she has a friend over, especially if she’s there alone and wants some company. "
b4xuui,"NTA - she's an asshole. Id throw her out next time. Start locking the door (i do it even when i am home alone, this is how much i value bathroom privacy)"
b4xvs2,"NTA. I’m sympathetic to your current girlfriend being uncomfortable with this. Would you be working alongside your ex again? If it’s just her mom that doesn’t seem too bad without knowing how close you were. 

But ultimately it’s your career. Internships are incredibly valuable and your career is something that will likely matter to you for the rest of your life. I think it’s completely reasonable of you to prioritize that above a girl you’ve been dating for under a year. "
b4xwni,"NAH.  You being upset is okay and natural.  You're in a tough situation.   Why do your parents move so much?  If it's for jobs -- that's no fun for anyone -- but try to see it from their point of view.  The job makes money, and you've got to have money to live."
b4xwzd,"NTA
You didnt do anything wrong, but you could have offered them some support/emapthy if they were crying about it. It was obviously more than just a lost game to them.

May have been better to celebrate in the locker room or something"
b4xxgt,"NTA - My sister is just like yours. BPD is a scary thing. Has your mom taken her to see a Psychiatrist? When my sister is on her meds, she is a completely different and amazing person. Maybe it would do the same for yours."
b4xybu,"It’s a little more complicated than that. OP didn’t drop her because he didn’t get his way.... he can’t be friends with her because it is painful for him. He isn’t stepping away to spite her, he is stepping away because obviously a friendship is unrealistic with his feelings towards her"
b4xypq,"NAH. It’s a tree of their family. Your parents are divorced, and you dad is remarried. Your bio mom is part of your family, but not part of theirs. "
b4xzow,NTA. Husband ruined your clothes by not following your directions. They needed to be replaced.
b4y444,"ESH. You were somewhat overstepping boundaries in your new relationship.

But her behaviour raises the question, why she drove around to drop her friends of and then returned, instead of just staying there from the beginning (which would have been more time and sleep efficient, seeing as she herself couldn't drive anyway)."
b4y641,"Ohhhhhh, tough. NTA. He made the decision to cheat without giving you all the information. If you chose to tell the wife then you might do it anonymously. Like through a non-gender-specific Facebook profile or precisely delivering a letter or something like that?"
b4y64r,"I'm curious what other people will say about this, but in my opinion NAH. It probably makes it feel less stigmatized and embarrassing for homeless people if the crowd is more mixed, and one additional person isn't adding much to the cost of the meal for the church. They're free to put specifics on it if they want to, and they haven't, so go ahead."
b4y6dt,NTA. She took advantage of you to try to hawk that Mary Kay shit. A small gift may be the diplomatic thing to do anyway but you're well within your rights not to buy anything.
b4ybkh,"NAH-I think it’s just a difference of opinion and could go either way. His thinking appears to be more of the idea of if you never take risks, you may never get a reward. If this is the best and only time to take the trip and your wife is 100% okay with using her PTO, then go and enjoy yourself. If she will resent you later for using all her time when something comes up, then just go by yourself. Honestly, I don’t think anyone is an asshole here, it’s just 2 different ways of seeing the situation. "
b4ydt6,YTA.  She just had a baby and probably didn’t realize how low her tolerance has become. 
b4yfv2,NAH 20% is fine but $5 is a cleaner number 
b4yjxq,NAH. You're not an asshole because it's reasonable to get frustrated in the situation you described. You're bf isn't an asshole because he cares about you. This sounds like a misunderstanding that can be solved with more communication! :)
b4ylk4,"Info. Are you in a position to implement policies?

Edit: NTA based on your position. It's part of your job to ensure everyone has a sanitary, safe working environment. "
b4yo60,YTA. A giant one. Don't send dick pics to people who didn't ask for them.
b4yucs,"YTA. You took it way, way too far, and apologizing again isn't going to cut it. This professional relationship isn't going to recover - you told her all jokes are going to be treated as malicious lies, and now you're sad that she's not joking around with you?

Get used to your new, serious, quiet coworker and maybe think about how to dial back next time. A simple ""Could you cut out the joke answers tonight, I'm at the end of my rope and can't handle it"" would have been way more professional on your end."
b4yx07,"NTA, child support is your kid's money."
b4yxj8,"NTA.

You're a 5 shooting for a 9.  I admire the ambition.  "
b4yxpa,"NTA A lot of couples share finances/bills. You aren't an asshole for borrowing the money from her, especially since she offered and in no way is bothered by it. She knows you'll pay her back, so don't listen to the guy, he's an asshole and an idiot if he thinks people never share/borrow money from loved ones. "
b4z0ah,NTA - but a fool who has let him sell your stuff for weed already. You seem to be closing the stable door long after the horse has bolted and crossed the border into the next state.
b4z0t4,"NAH. Take her at her word, you're not expected at both. Also consider it a nice gesture that she thinks highly enough of you to invite you to both."
b4z1mf,"NTA - in this situation, but you’re being a dick to your self by staying with his loser ass. 

Girl, just go on and do your self a favor that will augment your life greatly: dump his broke ass. You shouldn’t have to take care of your grown ass boyfriend. He sounds like he’s terrible with managing money and that’s not your responsibility to bear. That’s *his* job to get *his* finances in order to buy *himself* his own car.

b4z2oj,"NTA - She's dieting/fasting not you, if she wants it to work she needs to find the willpower to keep going regardless of what you're doing in the kitchen "
b4z4ue,"YTA. It's a common enough mistake so I don't think you're a huge asshole but it's really hard to dispute the argument that using the term that means a female child to refer to an adult can be demeaning. I really doubt that you would ever in a million years refer to a coworker as ""a boy who has done similar work."" Using boy or girl may be appropriate when in a familiar setting (hey my girls/boys are here!! whats up girls/boys!!) but in a professional setting it's not really appropriate. Standards change, in this case for good reason, and it's not a crime to change with them."
b4z5ww,"NTA. You give your mother an ultimatum “be supportive and never give either of us, or the child, shit about this or GTFO.” 

It’s your choice, you’ve made it and you’re happy with it, even if you’re not happy about the way it came about. She can either live with it and be in your lives or she can’t and she misses out. "
b4z6wb,"NTA, but your brother is. Don't shoot shit at animals just for the shits and giggles."
b4za79,"NTA.

For someone who ""isn't doing anything wrong"", he is acting suspicious."
b4zeg9,YTA. I can guarantee your boss was reimbursed for that but almost certainly you just have an insane piss poor work attitude. Thanking people for feeding you for managing not to fuck up and get hurt at work is not a crime and makes sense. You weren’t obligated and should have kept your mouth shut when your coworker said thank you. Clearly you guys have an issue working safely if they had to incentivize it for you.
b4zel2,"Obvious NTA. The victims family being able to have a fair and honest investigation of their loved one’s murder outweighs any loyalty to your partner’s boss. You did the right thing, he should be reported. "
b4zi6f,NTA *She*  can't handle a LDR.
b4zj3t,"YTA, but I don't think you're some kind of dangerous rapist to be hauled off or anything, just somebody who overstepped a bit. You should have said ""can I do this to do you?"" or something if you haven't done it to her before. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean that you have wide permission to do specific things. There's things she will NEVER let you do to her, so in the future I would recommend talking to her about things you want to do beforehand. An understandable slip up I think but admitting you should have asked first and then asking first in the future is the better course of action."
b4zjq3,"YTA. You've just unleashed an epidemic of ""too slowing"" all over the playground at that kid's school. Hundreds of innocent victims will be effected. Dozens of BFF bracelets will be discarded. Think of the ramifications of your actions next time."
b4znj1,NTA. Sex is An important part of most romantic relationships.
b4zoi9,"NAH. It's possible that she's hurt because she was making an effort to be conscious of her pronoun usage and you corrected her. Maybe she feels like that effort was not appreciated. Of course, this wasn't your intention, so I don't think that either of you are really assholes in this situation. However, your mom would be TA if she outright refused to call you by whatever specific pronouns you requested out of spite. "
b4zpgy,"YTA

For magically expecting them to give you the answers you wanted to hear. How are they supposed to know if they can't read your mind? You are definitely allowed to tell them what works for you and what doesnt but you can't be mad at them for just not knowing (and it sounds like they tried their best). 

>, I tried to bait a reaction out of them. It took a while before they noticed something was wrong, as I feigned a morbid happiness for an hour or so.

They're your friends and I dont think you should feel like you need to hide your real emotions from them, as it can just become a burden that builds up. Sometimes it's better to just be fully transparent and be like ""guys I had a really rough time and need to talk about it"". People definitely appreciate honesty and, as your friends, they probably want to be there for you as much as you do for them, even if their advice needs work haha. 

All this said, I'm sorry you have to deal with all this, it sounds like a tough situation and I hope everything works out for the best. "
b4zqq3,I say ESH. It’s shitty of your group mates to barely participate in the project but if you had a problem with it you should’ve spoken up sooner or explained to the professor that you had barely any help on the project instead of making comments when everyone received their grades. 
b4zqun,"YTA - Your intentions aren’t bad and understandable, but let her do what she loved and trust her. A good relationship is one with trust in it. Don’t let jealously or fear turn your relationship toxic"
b4zrkt,"YTA. There's any number of reasons this could be happening, and you've taken it personally. If it bothers you that much, why not ask the server instead of giving them a shitty look?"
b4zsmu,"ESH. “You’re not cut out for programming” isn’t great advice IMO - he might get it some way, but not the way he’s going about it now. And you’re right for not allowing him an internship purely via nepotism. He shouldn’t expect it and should be looking for ways to make himself competitive. Basically, he needs to work harder/differently and you should be encouraging of his desire to program (that doesn’t mean you should hand him career advancement on a silver platter, though, so good on you.)"
b4zsod,"NAH, weird and self centred but doesn’t matter to the extent that you’d be an asshole."
b4zvi9,"NAH.  Yeah, that's weird as hell.  I understand why you're uncomfortable.  It seems like this is genuinely a networking move, though.  Why don't you take her up on the offer to meet him and see how you feel."

b504zx,"NTA. Even if your mother was supportive about mental health, your parents and a therapist do not a healthy support network make. Having communities is very important. I don't blame them for being suspicious of a secret life online because wild shit happens on the internet and all of that, but they have the wrong ideas about their roles and the roles of your friends being mutually exclusive. They are hampering your ability to deal with your queerness in a healthy way."
b508hc,NAH. Seems like a simple miscommunication you didn't know where she was and assumed she would pass on the left because of traffic laws. She probably just rang her bell so you would know she was behiend you so you and your friend didn't suddenly move in from of her while she was passing. 
b5093s,"NTA

Your parents are putting blinders on so they don't see their wonderful little girl's thieving. Your mom is doing mental gymnastics to justify it."

I don't understand how she hasn't gotten the message if you actually had this conversation with her already."
b50r0c,"NAH. You did what you felt you needed to do for your emotional well-being at the time. It can be really hard to be friends with an unreciprocated crush. However, you may wanna consider rekindling the friendship if you feel you’re in a better place now. It’s be a shame to lose a good friend’s presence in your life over something like this "
b50skc,NTA. His lack of gumption isn't your problem. Go out with her and have a great time.
b50xm1,"NTA. Your dad was and still is abusive, and your grandmother enables his behavior. It's hard because they're family, but you are not obligated to keep putting yourself in harm's way to make them feel better.

b514p3,NTA. He's not a child anymore and he needs to learn to be more proactive and take responsibility for his life. Maybe he needs to go to a local junior college until he get his shit together.

b515q1,NTA - she’s seems self centred and a healthy friendship is give and take 
b5167a,"YTA. I had a psych professor in college that said something that really resonated with me. She basically said that if people are fabricating hardship, you should support them for it. Not because the hardship is real, but because it's a serious cry for help. Try to look past the lying for attention/support, and see the person who is struggling with something that is causing them to do that. "
b51bqv,"So basically you are focusing on the fact that you got caught being an asshole, instead of the fact that you were an asshole."
b51edc,"I mean this doesn't seem like he's actually racist at all? (or at least not from what you told us) Sure it's kind of a weird comment and if it came from someone you weren't familiar with I'd question it, but you also said he has no problem with people of other races he interacts with, so... ? I'd say you implied he was more racist than he was with your own assessment and telling of the story to T. 

YTA "
b51eoc,"NTA, but this is more of an r/relationships problem so I would consider posting there. "
b51f4u,"YTA. There’s a mature and immature way to do things, you chose the immature one.

There. Not so hard, isn’t it."
b51jtv,"YTA but not for the reason you think. If somebody tells you they're doing some illegal stuff then you should probably keep it to yourself. Otherwise I think with that age gap, you're justified in not running to the cops with it."
b51l0x,"YTA, they are doing you a favour man. There is nothing on it for them, if anything storing your car it's a bother. "
b51ljl,"NAH.  You were a customer acting pretty unusual--standing around and not shopping, saying you don't need help.  Then you wander around, still not really looking seriously before you try on shoes, and pick them up to walk to the front of the store and you're now visibly anxious. 

I can't blame her for thinking you might be shoplifting. 

It sucks that your anxiety was triggered and I don't think you were an asshole for telling her she triggered your anxiety but that's kind of not her problem.  I hope that you can work on getting your anxiety under control."
b51p9c,"NTA

Your girlfriend is an asshole x 3:

* She's an asshole for that ""prank""
* She's an asshole for getting mad at you for throwing up in he bed because of something **she** did
* She's an asshole for lying to you about it being her who did it

**Edit:**  Upon further review, it appears that she was blackout drunk and doesn't remember doing it.  But she's still an asshole for thinking that shit like that is funny, and for frequently getting blackout drunk as you mentioned in the comments."
b51vxs,"NTA. **You owe no loyalty to capitalism: capitalism feels no loyalty to you.** If they wanted to put a requirement on you that you had to stay working there for a certain number of years after finishing your scholarship or else you'd have to pay them back, they would have; that kind of stipulation is routine. They didn't. Do what's best for you."
b51xcf,NTA for taking care of your health.
b51xp5,"NTA and neither is your girlfriend. Of course you don't want to go over there, it sounds like a nightmare but she doesn't want to be there either, she feels like she has to because it's her family. Maybe having you over some times makes it more bearable for her? 

Is there anyway you can help her out cause it really sounds like she needs a break. I felt stressed just reading this message, I can't imagine how you both feel living it. "
b51z3n,"NAH.

You need to cut contact and actually move on, dude. You can sit here and give platitudes like ""I'm happy for her, even if it's not with me!"" and the like, and one day, it might even be true. But it's not yet.

Just pull back, stop hanging out with her, stop hanging out with them, remove her from social media, and lose her number.

If she asks, be honest. Tell her you thought you could be her friend, but now that she's dating you realize that you hadn't actually dealt with the break up and need some space to let that wound heal. "
b522v4,NTA. While understand why they'd feel weird about it are you in no way a sexual predator. also for the love of god tell your therapist if it makes you so miserable.
b524ct,"ESH, I can understand not wanting a stranger on vacation with you, but messaging the poor guy directly like that? Douchebag move. The ""original organizer"" is also an asshole. He definitely should have made sure it was ok before he invited anybody else. Sounds like this trip is going to be awkward."
b527m7,NTA. He's still hung up on her. It's not a coincidence that he's randomly trying to get his stuff back a year later while you're out of town. You should start distancing yourself and take some time to figure things out. 
b52c15,"NTA. You don't have to be teacher to discipline the rest of the class fellows.

It may have been a bit too extreme behavior though to yell it at them."
b52db3,"NAH

I think you might have gotten the wrong idea about this. Theres an almost unspoken rule between girlfriends that you dont date guys that you're both interested in. They dont want it to lead to division in their friendship and theres a good chance Jamie didn't ACTUALLY say not to date you, but that her friend is being considerate of Jamie's feelings. The girls aren't assholes for respecting their friendship and you're not an asshole for feeling weird about the situation. I would say though, that if Jamie having a crush on you bothers you, just talk to her about it to see if you can continue to be friends in spite of it. "
b52h36,"NTA - I think it's pretty obvious.

One question/remark though. How come there is sensitive information like that on display? Maybe it's the country or the bank or whatever, but in my experience, when it's about receiving money, no sensitive information is needed or given."
b52mda,"NTA. If the dogs are dangerous and the owner isn’t willing to put the work in to train them and/or re-homing isn’t an option, I don’t think there’s another option other than euthanising them. They could have easily killed a child. "
b52ocy,NTA the guy could have stopped and explained his mistake but instead he drove off without any concern.
b52p05,"NTA obviously - possibly SHP because it’s so obvious. Your mother is abusive. Stick with your sister.

Had to repost because mods don’t like facts"
b52qcz,"NTA
This is a very country thing to do. I totally ok if you are ok with that. 
It's not something I could do or would be ok with but it's not something you are who am I to say."
b52rg0,"YTA.

1) I don't get the feeling you actually cared about this dude's mental heatlh. It sounds like you were annoyed by how he treated you. You even admit he was probably being a smartass. 

2) What questions were you asking? How many? Maybe he just told you he didn't know because he was annoyed by the questions or if there was a lot or something. Not excusing it if that's the case, but jumping to him having alzheimer's is kind of excessive based only on one five minute interaction with someone. 

3) His mental health is none of your business, nor is it his employer's. 

You way overstepped imo, and personally I think you owe this dude an apology...."
b52tza,"NTA, and my advice is to cut your losses while you’re ahead."
b52v4u,"NAH

She's grieving and I don't think she realizes the impact that having a dead child's things would have on others, including other children who are vulnerable themselves.

However, there's nothing at all asshole-ish about you noticing that impact and wanting to prevent your son from experiencing it... as well as not wanting to waste the space. There are other ways to pay tribute to her son's memory, I'm sure, than devoting a whole room to his old things or using part of your son's room for them."
b52v6l,NTA - you’ve tried talking to him about it multiple times. 
b52wm6,"NTA, but are you really comfortable being friends with someone like that?"
b52zoa,"NTA

Does this guy have any professional intervention?  Because his mother and sister aren't able to help him.

Autism or not, that behavior shouldn't be tolerated, and your boyfriend is enabling him."
b5318l,"NTA. You have the right to make your own choices. Assuming you never offered or implied you'd do it for other family members, you don't owe them shit. "
b531mu,"ESH - she's an asshole for hitting on you while on a date with someone else.  You're an asshole for letting her do that to him, and for taking her home *while they were on a date*.

He's an asshole for going on a date with such a person in the first place....but not the ""I'm a dick"" kind of asshole, just the, ""I've been had"" kind of asshole.

Everyone here is an asshole.

If this kind of thing ever happens to you again, just get her number for later."
b53225,"NTA

Stop cooking her dinner if she's going to take your hard work and effort and feed it to dogs.

b533rm,NTA - If they were intentional about it then they were the dicks.
b536wa,"YTA and to be honest I was on your side until you said ""it's unflattering"". Try to understand with yourself why it's ok to you that your roommates (so people that you literally live with) smoke and you are not ok with her in particular smoking. If the reason is only because she is your SO (which I doubt), just tell her you prefer her not to do that when you are nearby."
b537l7,NAH. But why not just take all the trash food out of the house and fill it with things you can eat? Then everybody gets the food they want and lives a healthier life. I only wish I had the desire to eat healthy foods when I was a kid.
b53dqu,"Your mother sounds like a difficult person to deal with. Trying to make her children ‘pick a side’ between her and their father in such an inconsequential neighbourly argument is not a good reflection on her personality.

NTA. Your mother needs to learn conflict resolution and stop relying on *literal children* for emotional support. "
b53fbc,NTA. She's toxic as hell.
b53ftk,"NAH-

I’m sure they think it’s harmless, but if it isn’t I’m sure you could bring it up and just lightly touch down on how it’s unfair, and that it’s bothering you. If no one else is being a stickler for the rules maybe you’re being a bit grumpy, but if it’s bothering you you should be able to bring it up with friends. "
b53hks,"NTA - this isn’t even a “respect your elders” thing. The guy at the gym who asked your nephew to move in the first place sucks. That’s not cool, that’s such an entitled way of thinking. If your nephew was working out correctly, and wasn’t there for an inordinate amount of time, he was perfectly in the right to stay and utilize the machine. I don’t think his workout is worth less because he’s younger. "
b53j2u,"Dude. He clearly means *while he’s in the room* and/or *with his consent*. 

YTA, you straight up cheated on him.

Good luck worming your way out of this. Lesson learned, am I right? "
b53lbd,"NTA at all. it sounds like he’s very controlling and manipulative and emotionally abusive. the dictating-what-you-wear thing is a HUGE red flag, revealing clothing or not, and the jealousy factor is a red flag too. i work at a domestic violence shelter. he can feel however he wants about piercings, hair dyes, clothes, but he’s trying to control you through those things and it will likely lead to isolating you from friends (to “protect you” or some BS like that) and probably later from family. i would highly suggest staying away from him. you are not the asshole here, you can dress however you damn well please and get as many piercings and color your hair whatever color you want. if he’s going to dump you over such superficial things then he doesn’t care about your personality, he only knows he can get you to do things he wants (or doesn’t want) you to do"

b53pu3,"NAH. It was against the rules of the apartment and your roommate owed you money as it was.  The cat was not your responsibility and therefore you weren't technically in the wrong.  Morally however, that's just so wrong of you, the cat didn't do anything wrong to you. "
b53qho,"NAH. If it bothers you, talk to her about it. She’s not under an obligation to because she’s your GF, if it’s important to you let her know. "
b53trn,"YTA for being mad *at her*.

What happened definitely doesn't sound ok, but she's young and didn't realise that what was happening was abnormal. You should be mad at the masseuse and I would encourage you to reach out to his employer."
b53tsr,NTA. It's his damn baby too and he's not doing anything to support you. Do what you have to do to get him to contribute beyond some basic shit. His girlfriend should be concerned that he's avoiding his responsibility as a parent to his child.
b53v2r,"YTA. It's a benign habit and you're super reading into it. Let her speak the way she wants and don't do stuff like this that makes her self-conscious about speaking near you, her husband. If its just something she picked up from a show then it'll probably pass anyway."
b53ynb,"ESH

Friends aren't projects for you to fix. If they're genuinely interested in not being dicks, then great! But otherwise, it's simply not your place.

b54561,"NTA. When I offer my friends a shot at my bar, I mean it's going to be comped. When I ask if they want more drinks and I mean to charge them, I intentionally use different language.. sometimes outright asking if they want to ""buy another one"" (I can be blunt if we're friends)."

I think you need to have a good long talk with your partner about this. There’s definitely something more to it that might warrant a serious reconsideration of your feelings about her and the relationship.

I’m not advocating a break-up - I’m merely saying that maybe you’re worth more than someone who, instead of appreciating the idea of it and effort to put together a trip to Disneyland by actually focusing on spending it with you, chooses to tell everyone else about it instead. 

Regardless, from how you’ve described it, you’re definitely NTA. "
b55b5x,"YTA.  You know she is ""broke af"".  Why wouldn't you just give it to her?"
b55cx1,"NTA it was a harmless, self-depricating joke. it's not that deep."

I was brought up very religious and my husband is Atheist. He allowed me to take our son to church when he was a baby but was not okay with me doing a “Dedication” (to God) so we only did a celebration type thing with the godparents at church instead.

Since then, I’ve become Atheist as well and am glad I didn’t do a “Dedication” in the end. Also, slowly realising how much religion fucked me up as a child and into adulthood, I wouldn’t push that on my kids.

It’s funny, only in recent times have I come clean to my parents that I’m Atheist and Dad actually asked me the other day, if I’m Atheist, what’s to stop me from doing bad things. I had to explain that just because I’m not religious doesn’t mean that I don’t have an internal moral code! I COULD do bad things but I CHOOSE not to and not because I think some almighty being will punish me otherwise."
b5670k,YTA. Your brother-in-law is in the hospital. Your sister is in distress and needs help. You obviously don't respect either of them.
b569ht,"NTA. Yeah, you shouldn’t have smoked (not because you shouldn’t smoke, but because you told her you wouldn’t, and lies suck). 

But, she seems to be little over-dramatic about it all. She should respect your RSVP to a gender reveal (which is a big deal). I understand being super tired, exhausted and cranky - but she chose to help out with the kids. It’s not your job to help her wind down after a stressful week. That’s her job. "
b56hpp,"NTA for being jealous, but don’t make accusations before you get more info. Talk to the guy."

b56m41,NTA. Your response was justifiable and understandable. What they did isn’t cool. A successful relationship requires effort from all parties involved.
b56sl5,NTA. worth trying to talk it through in a few days when she's had time to think though. But if her parents get more say in your sex than you then I don't blame you if it doesn't work
b56ttf,NAH. But I do think you are overreacting. I don't think it's hurting anyone to have these billboards up. Besides you I guess.
b56wlp,"NTA - you are trying to protect him, but lets be honest. thats never going to work. he's a train wreck and that will never change, you are right he is distracting himself from his problems with a kid - and that should never be the motivstion to have one.
kids are either planned or an accident, you cope with those situations, but I don't see them coping while planning to put a child in this situation with them.
I'd let go of him, because he will drag you down, too.
you gave him your honest opinion - unsolicited maybe, but I'd say it would be irresponsible to say absolutely nothing. he is about to ruin a young kids life"
b56xej,"NTA. 

I was leaning towards no assholes (after all, the trip is not a bad way to celebrate so why not use that?) But even if she might not see it as specially as you, you have a right to be excited and validated. And I think it is very unrealistic that she has NO time in the next three weeks to entertain a small celebration with you. And the shrug emoji is petty. She is not concerned with your feelings at all, and that's not very good."

She is not staying at her OWN house because she enjoys being with you that much. I say just respect that she is sleeping and also has to get up to go to work. Find a different way to light the room or just use the little lamp. When my girlfriend moved in, I stopped turning my lamp on and hung Christmas lights that I can turn on with my phone. I use those to get up in the morning.

b5ax04,"NTA - she probably doesn't realize how incredibly offensive that is. Not to mention that a thought like that is *pretty harmful* to the existing children that you already have.

You're upset because they gave you a gift from a store that you like, but it wasn't *exactly* what you would have bought for yourself, really? It sounds more like they put no thought into your brother's gifts (they like video games? gift card!) and actual, real thought into yours. If you only see them on special occasions, how in the world would they know you only use the candles?

Basically what you're doing here is ""my family spent time and effort looking at the things I like to give me a personalized gift, but they didn't pick the ***right*** thing I like to give me gifts for, so I'm mad at them!""

b5bwdq,NTA. Sounds like you dodged a bullet. Coke heads don't make good partners. 
b5bxce,"NTA. The entire reason that the Catholic Church waits until your teen years to confirm you is that you are supposed to choose to be confirmed of your own free will. It's supposed to be something you truly want, and not just something you go along with because your family forced you to - that's why being baptized isn't ""enough"" for you to get married in the church. You aren't supposed to force someone to get confirmed against their will. Your family is in the wrong here. You have the right to your own religious beliefs, even if you aren't 18 yet, and they cannot force you to believe in something that you don't want to. They can ask that you still attend church with the family, even if you aren't getting anything out of it, but asking you to lie and commit yourself to the Catholic church under false pretenses is wrong.

It actually feels like your husband is in this catch22 kind of situation, that you put him on.

He was kind of inconsiderate, yes, but you are the one that's creating the whole ""if you apologize/give me something, then it's because I asked to. If you don't, is because you don't care"" stuff..."
b5c3uv,"YTA, come on now. Jeff was abused by this man. I understand your mom is grieving but you're asking Jeff to put himself in the position of reliving a lot of childhood trauma. I don't think you're understanding the extent to which childhood abuse can fuck a person up. Your mom needs to recognize that while the abuse is not her fault, Jeff was a vulnerable child who was abused in her care. Just because he's an adult now doesn't mean he's not still the child and she's the parent. She needs to let him deal with your father's death however he sees fit.

To be clear, I don't think you're an asshole in general because I understand you feel stuck in the middle, but calling him a dick for protecting himself was an asshole move."

She has a mental illness and was trying her best to make up for her actions. 

Was she right to lie to you about it? Of course not. However, asking her to stop and control herself is just as, if not more shitty.

Would you ask someone with depression to just ""be happier""? Someone with OCD to just ""stop being so obsessive""?

Try to have some damn sympathy.

EDIT: To address /u/couplesthrow69, /u/Boredread, and /u/OnTheSlope, as well as anyone else who is thinking about using the ""If the roommate was depressed I'd sure tell them to stop stealing my food"": You've misunderstood my point. Bulimia is an eating disorder, which means that the behaviours associated with it (ie. binging) is not the same as the behaviours associated with depression. My intention in the comparison I made was that you cannot tell someone to stop doing something directly caused by a mental illness. You all make good points, but they're not applicable to this situation."
b5cdi2,"NTA

Real question, can you kick this POS out of your place?"
b5cecu,"ESH. She sounds like a terrible human being, but withholding communication and then blowing up about a number of unrelated items is always a bad strategy. Also ""I couldn't be happier"" is by definition an asshole thing to say about someone who is dying, even if they too are an asshole."

I'm a little confused about this part though: ""In the last three or four years, he has invited me to one event outside of his home, birthday parties, block parties, and New Year celebrations, all of which I have attended.""

It's an unfortunate situation all around. It sounds like S wasn't ready to be in a relationship, and it was pretty unfair of him to wait until you were unavailable to confess. I don't blame you for wanting to take a step back from your friendship with S to concentrate on your relationship. 

That said, just ghosting him forever seems like a bit much, for someone you've been close friends with for years. If it were me I would scale back the frequency and intensity, but I would try to stay in each others lives."

b5df7o,"NTA Your colleague's reaction was deliberately done to get a response from your manager. Yes a faux pas to use the work computer but it was in your own time and is for an internal change so not as big a deal as it could have been, your manager could have been far more accepting of this."
b5dfcv,"NTA - she had a really weird reaction to your honesty. I am generally skeptical of mother in laws, particularly when they act like this. "
b5dln1,"YTA - If you want to spend more time with your bf, have a dialogue about spending more time together.

b5ds6n,"NTA - you clearly lined up that you can't pay for things right now, and for him to keep throwing it in your face like that is really rude. Especially so early in the relationship. If he wants to visit and do fancy things he doesn't have to drag you along and can go by himself.

Still you don't treat another person like that."
b5dutg,"YTA

It's not your place to tell your sister to drop it when her husband wasn't there to support her, see the birth of his child (and could actually be there).

She absolutely cannot tell you ""if I can't go you can't go"". Fuck that"
b5e813,"NTA. It was consensual between two adults.  You're not her therapist, and don't have any responsibility to be one.  It's condescending of your sister to assume her friend doesn't have agency and needs people to take care of her.

Also, because I have experience with pathological liars, and this woman sounds like one, it's a mental illness and you're not going to ""fix her"" by calling out her lies. So in addition, your sister is also just wrong."

b5eehl,"ESH

There are several factors at play here, but I think you're both being assholes albeit for understandable reasons.

Wanting to see your best friend is valid, but your girlfriend also wants to see you after multiple weeks and you're not making any kind of effort to even ballpark when you might be able to spend time with her. ""Dunno"" is a cop-out. ""Why don't we pencil something in for Thursday"" would at least demonstrate that you're thinking about seeing her even though your top priority is temporarily elsewhere. 

Also, are you going to be spending 24/7 with your friend? Are you not able to take a few hours to get lunch with your girlfriend or something like that? Doesn't sound like splitting time to me. And hell -- ""I need time to think about our relationship"" after she said she felt like you weren't making time for her? That's dodging a response and in some ways punishing her for feeling ignored. Uncool.

*That said*, your girlfriend's reaction as you've presented it here is a bit over-the-top. ""It's not normal"" is very dependent on context, and ""I don't want to talk"" is stonewalling, which isn't the healthiest thing. Understandable if she's feeling ignored anyway, but shutting down doesn't solve problems.

Y'all really need to work on your communication."

>I think she is being way too forward and I am not ready. 

All you have to do is tell her that you're not ready to live with her at this time.  However, I'd avoid giving her a definite future time when you *will* be ok with it, because you want to find out if she thinks her mom is going to be moving into this future house of yours along with her.  Yikes."
b5emgr,"NAH - I don't think there's anything wrong with what you cook, but it seems like you two have mismatched effort towards this chore and it's clearly upsetting her. I don't think it's wrong for her to be upset that the two of you split a chore and she puts a lot of effort into making it nice while you do the minimum.

But I also think that lazy dishes are necessary to normal function. You just can't cook an intricate dish every day, sometimes you have to fall back on ""jar of marinara sauce in some noodles"". I think you two can find a compromise."
b5et80,YTA. Constant DJing is much louder and more annoying than loud sex. Have you even tried talking to them about it? 
b5etvd,"If I read it right, she wanted her boyfriend to help so it could be dropped off at a shelter that *wouldn’t* kill it.

b5fm4g,"NTA - your dad doesn't have the right to abuse a child, even if it is his. He needs to treat you better and you deserve an apology."
b5frst,"NTA - you definitely have a right to your bread and goods within the fridge and they exploited that. That said, I think demanding payback is probably not the best tactic and will lead to unnecessary escalation. They operated within a gray-ish area and absolutely should have asked your permission BUT given that these aren't exactly fun toys but rather pretty basic staples given to a mother no less, I can understand their position to some extent. Hard to assess without knowing how in need they or the mom is.

If they'd wasted the food or ate it all drunk, it'd be a bit different. In light of this, I think you should back off the demands for compensation BUT when you get your bread and milk replenished, you can state that you will no longer be sharing because of what happened in the past and leave it at that. If they violate your trust again, then new roomies would be in order

b5ft9n,"NAH, but it sounds like you two need to have a serious conversation where you tell him how important it is for him to have some kind of symbol of your commitment that's visible and he wears daily. What form it takes is where the compromise comes in; you clearly want a ring but it could be a tattoo, an armband, etc."
b5ftpc,"Not gonna lie, I feel like it's a bit of YTA just for the reason that he's made it clear that he won't stop wearing it, yet you keep repeatedly telling him to stop. 


If he keeps wearing it, that's his prerogative, and if you don't want to be his friend because of him being a furry, that's yours. But hassling him repeatedly kind of makes you the asshole."
b5fu1a,NTA this is really weird. You don't need friends like that in your life. 
b5fun6,"NTA - You can’t “easily” take the train.   Like you said, money is tighter for you, and that 50 bucks you’re saving is worth it if you’re living paycheck to paycheck.  Yes, it would be nice to feel like you’re saving the planet, but keep in mind that it’s mostly big businesses and industries that are making that huge impact.  Money is a huge factor  when making these “environmentally friendly” decisions, because they are ultimately more expensive. Keep driving, save up that money.

I would suggest doing a face to face meet up with you as a buffer between the two groups. It's an awful situation, but at some point, we all need to take responsibility for our actions. 

It could also be a chance for him to open up to his family about how he has viewed their treatment of him over the years.

b5ghk6,"YTA. I'm assuming all the texting, driving, and jacket-wearing is something she did before he asked her out. If they're still friends, she probably thinks it's fine to keep acting the same way they did as before.

Obviously your friend has an issue expressing his feelings, which is why you had to push him to just tell her in the first place. Your place here is the exact same: if there's something he wants to ask her, you should encourage him to just talk to her.

You're not TA for any of your wedding preferences, but you are acting somewhat entitled by taking your parents' $$ and then ignoring many of their wishes out of hand. The address thing seems like the easiest thing to fix and it is actually a tad confusing. It's also not a feminist thing--you just fucked up the address and don't want to spend the money to fix it. That's understandable, but seems of less import than your stance on the veil, etc. 

As for the walking-down-the aisle business, I've seen a lot of weddings where \*both\* parents walk both the bride and groom down the aisle when they enter.  It's suuuuper sweet and does honor your parents. Might be worth a thought? "

You shouldn’t be dobbing in your housemate to the landlord. In standard rental situations the landlord wouldn’t know the occasional bending of a rule, and it’s invasive to your housemate to have you spying on him on the landlords behalf.

Your landlord is also a dick to put you in the middle of it. There’s a reason landlords are meant to give warning of visits, and that’s to give tenants privacy. By getting you to spy for him it’s removing that privacy. 

Your housemate is also an asshole for bringing in a dog that’s banned, also for having his uncle over constantly.

And now you’ve proven her feelings were justified. Thats probably the real reason she is upset- because you said you didn’t like Megan and then ended up dating her.

Keep in mind, it's shared space for the people who live there. So you having your boyfriend there would make someone often feel trapped within their own bedroom. She came out for air to study, in that shared space, and then he showed up and you started to watch TV.

I think, honestly, that your frequent invitation to your boyfriend to enter that space without having consulted with your roommates makes YTA

You're friend is in the honeymoon phase of an exciting new relationship and you're upset that they aren't available to hang out as much anymore. This is super common when close friends develop other relationships outside of your own. 

Your friend shouldn't commit to plans that they can't make however you shouldn't be offended by the fact they want to spend as much time as possible with their new SO. 

Give it time and maybe send them a friendly message like ""hey mate, you seem super busy with your exciting new relationship and I am happy for you, let me know when you are free to catch up at some point"" and wait for them to initiate a plan. 

In the meantime view this as an opportunity to focus on your own relationship/expanding your friend pool so you aren't so reliant on this mate. "

You were rude, arrogant unprofessional and made a very poor first impression on your boss.

All of this reads like you *seriously* downplaying how terrible your parents have been because you love them, and him telling you enough is enough. You and him should be priority one in a marriage. Your parents don't factor in. Do you really want his memories of the wedding to be ""and then my wife railroaded me into an event I knew I would hate on a day I wanted to spend with her alone""?

It's especially shitty when you consider that he said one of the problems was how big it was, and you thought an appropriate solution was ***cutting out all of his loved ones***. Like, that's verging on you being just...mean to your future husband."

I hope you realize your professional reputation is more important than what your coworkers think of you in a social setting.

That dog is going to get hungry. Giving it food in the morning is not going to be enough to sustain it for the whole day. Also it's going to end up going to the bathroom in the cage/house because no one will be there to take it out when it needs to. A three year old dog will go to the bathroom a lot! Dogs also need a LOT of socialization and attention so that they don't become antisocial/aggressive. Huskies need a LOT of exercise. They are not fit to have another dog. They should not get this husky. They should let someone better suited have it instead and it'd be selfish of them to get it when they cannot properly care for/raise it. "

b5u94x,"YTA - BIG TIME. The child is yours, you adopted them so stop referring to the child as hers only. You don't just get to change you mind and flip-flop on this whenever you want. 

She likely went out drinking because it was her night free from being a parent and that's what people do. You have no reason to think it was your money funding this. 

I hope she takes you to court so she can get what is really owed, and you can bet it will be more than what you are (not)paying now. 

Don't be a deadbeat mom and step up. You made your decisions, now live with your decisions."

b5upa5,[deleted]
b5uszv,"NTA, since there were already people rushing to help. If no one else had gone to help and you just ignored her, that would have been an asshole thing to do.

b5uy6v,"NTA, because it's the truth, but do you really want to start drama with her as well?"
b5v0tz,"YTA. It's unprofessional (and passive-aggressive) to let personal issues with someone affect how you interact with them at work. Your co-workers don't have to be your friend, and it's pretty petty to ""refuse to help them out with something because *some of them went out and didn't invite you.*"" You're not the center of the world. Also, if you *want* to have a better/closer relationship with those people, being a jerk to them at work is not a good way to go about that. "
b5v0up,"NTA

It's a very large responsibility to throw on somebody like that. There is nothing wrong with wanting to live your own life free of burden. You don't inherit a responsibility like that by simply being born. The fact that they just expect you to do this is extremely selfish on their part.  "

Bringing children into your family is a huge decision. Any and every concern has to be dealt with before anything happens. If one of the parents isn't comfortable with it, you shouldn't do it. 

Having said that, if you want to, you could talk to a variety of families that have done what your wife wants to do and see how the experience was for them. It might help convince your wife that you are taking it seriously and willing to have an open mind."
b5v6ha,"YTA. The way you worded your messages to her sounded so entitled. If you’re going to go someplace, always have at least a backup plan on getting back home. "
b5v6qy,NTA - But your girlfriend is. This is something she should work out with her roommate - having an SO stay over a lot can feel like something you didn't agree to when you moved in with a roommate. I'd hang back until the two of them can sit down and sort it out.

>He went from mad to being straight up terrifying

because *what the fuck*"
b5vis1,"NAH.

Your girlfriend probably hates the phrase ""I don't care"" because it sounds rude and she doesn't want you to think it's okay to be rude to your daughter under any circumstances, which is fair.

You can be firm, but it's better to just tell your daughter how it's gonna be. ""No toy until we get home. No toy at all if you don't stop."" Your word is law and you don't have to justify it. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that she's likely to mimic you because she looks up to you as her father. Little kids mimic almost  everything their parents do and it shapes much of who they become later in life. If you respond to her by saying you don't care, she could grow up to say the same thing to you. 

But she'll never get to mimic your authority as the parent until she's a fully independent adult. "
b5vj20,"YTA he didn’t cause the damage, a crack head did. He owes you nothing. Call your insurance company if it’s that big of a deal. That’s why you have it. "
b5vmyu,"NTA/WNBTA

I don't think you would be the asshole for not telling him. If he overreacts or reacts like how you said he might, that's his problem. You have no obligation to tell him and he has no need to actually know. What I think is that you should ask yourself if you think that your aunt would have wanted him there."
b5vo3o,NAH look this is something which you need to have a serious conversation about with your wife and explain how you feel about the situation and listen to how she feels. Neither of you are being assholes to each other here it seems to be just miscommunication. 
b5vv7s,"YTA - while it is thoughtful of you to purchase a ticket for her to attend your graduation, you didn't consider the complications it puts on her.

Did you stop to consider maybe it isn't a fear of driving long distances but perhaps a fear of being outside of her comfort bubble? She is responsible for another human being and a dog, did you consider how that would factor in to being able to go? Dropping the kid off at a parents house you say that she has concerns with isn't exactly a wise parenting choice now is it? "
b5vveh,NTA french way of saying hello was a huge shock to me when I moved there
b5vwb4,"NTA - that’s something to discuss with your SO, especially if you are at the home buying portion of your relationship.  It’s definitely understandable being upset over, especially if you had other things that needed to be purchased. "
b5vym2,Sounds like she dodged a major fucking bullet!

Relevant text:

""Speak-English -Only Rules


The EEOC has stated that rules requiring employees to speak only English in the workplace violate the law unless the employer can show that they are justified by business necessity.

A rule requiring employees to speak only English in the workplace at all times, including breaks and lunch time, will rarely be justified.


An English-only rule should be limited to the circumstances in which it is needed for the employer to operate safely or efficiently.


Circumstances in which an English-only rule may be justified include: communications with customers or coworkers who only speak English; emergencies or other situations in which workers must speak a common language to promote safety; cooperative work assignments in which the English-only rule is needed to promote efficiency.


Even if there is a need for an English-only rule, an employer may not take disciplinary action against an employee for violating the rule unless the employer has notified workers about the rule and the consequences of violating it."""

b5xwea,"NAH - Isn’t this what sisters are for? To call each other on their shit? At the same time your sisters issues obviously go deeper than procrastination which is just a symptom of a deeper problem. Her behavior sounds like a form of escapism and she’s probably overwhelmed with her day to day reality. You can help but in the end it’s not your responsibility to fix her. She has to want to change. Most people go to the grave without changing if that gives you any indication for the prospects of that happening. What you can control is your response to the behavior. Maybe don’t be so available. You have your own life. If she is forced to make the tough choices (game/kids being watched) than maybe she might see the light.

Pro Tip: if you want a better reaction from her than maybe you should curtail your gameplay or find another game. Chances are she won’t listen to you when she sees you doing the same thing even though you aren’t the one doing anything wrong. It’s just human psychology."

I mean...this sounds like it could be normal 3-year-old behavior, to be honest. If you're concerned, I would recommend looking into doing something like PCIT (parent child interaction therapy) with both parents to help communicate better with the 3-year-old and discipline more effectively. "

b60xy5,"NTA. I think I might be in the minority for thinking so though.

Leaving aside the fact that you and your mum bicker (a lot of teens do) I don’t think in this particular situation you were necessarily in the wrong. I’m not the most social at family events, and I prefer my own company. Your mum will know this and it is unfortunate that she will make remarks at your expense in front of the family, and seemingly mean them. All you really did was respond in kind.

Bear in mind the allegiances of the other people you’ve mentioned:
-Dad: Married to your mum, he’ll take her side.
-Siblings: Tend to love to get one over each other, and are probably happy to have a cause to crusade on.
-Aunt: Either your Mum or Dad’s sister, and likely to side with them accordingly. As a grownup will not want to undermine other grownups.

It’s not surprising that you’re getting grief for this. I would strongly suggest sitting down with your Mum and saying “We argue a lot, and that’s not constructive. I didn’t appreciate you making remarks at my expense in front of my family, when I hold their opinion dear. I accept that I upset you, however you did put me on the spot and so I returned to put us on a level playing field.  In the future, I would appreciate it if you did not speak about me as if I was not present, in a way, humorous or otherwise, designed to voice opposition to a perceived character flaw. I understand you probably feel I showed you up, but I would not have done so had I not been put in a position where you had set out to make me feel so small.”

b646ve,"yeah this is right to me. 

I think one thing that’s helped my partner and i a lot is trying to find ways to “translate” between our respective love languages. For example, my partner loves physical touch and i love words of affirmation. it took months for us to figure out that when he kisses me on the cheek it’s his way of telling me i’m cute or when he kisses me on the forehead is his way of telling me he thinks i have good ideas. When i’m sad he’ll boop me on the nose as his way of telling me he’s there with me and we can figure it out together. 

To check in, we’ll sometimes ask what % of the love one person is sending the other is feeling. for example, if i come home and at the end of a long day he gives me a back rub he might ask “do you feel my lovings?” as a way to remind me that he’s doing this because he loves me. and if it’s not doing it for me i can say “only like 20% of your lovings i think” as a way to acknowledge that he is sending me love and i appreciate it but it’s not working. then we might switch it up and cuddle and talk instead or watch TV or cook together. 

The last thing, and i don’t know if this is your situation, is my partner doesn’t like introspecting a lot. when things bother him he’ll usually just ignore them and focus on something else. But this really doesn’t work for me because, like you, i’m extremely expressive. When this becomes a chronic issue, he’ll sometimes shut down and not want to talk at all. the two things that work here for us are asking yes/no questions and taking time apart. At the start, yes/no questions were a good way for me to support my partner in unpacking what was bothering him when he didn’t know how to sort through it himself. Now, it’s more useful for me to tell him after that I’m worried about what was bothering him and i’d appreciate if he could think about it some and let me know so I know not to do it again. this can mean i won’t really be able to resolve the problem for a day or more, but it does help us communicate in a way that works for us. 

Beyond love languages, there’s a personality quiz I really like called crystal.io that gives you tips on how to talk to someone depending on the type of conflict you want to resolve after you both fill it out. I don’t think it’s always 100% accurate, but it does give you a good way to start a conversation about how to better communicate.

Maybe the last thing I want to mention is that all of this is super normal. My siblings have similar problems in their relationships, so do my parents. Maybe it’s genetic or something. But I think learning how to communicate better instead of chalking it up to “being incompatible” is one of the most rewarding parts of being in a relationship. I genuinely feel like I’m a better person because of how my partner has helped me grow. Im better at my job because i’m better at communicating with my coworkers about their needs. It’s made me a better daughter and a better friend. relationships shouldn’t cause you stress but every relationship requires some team work to overcome obstacles.

You can only be a friend to her—if you can’t be a good friend anymore then end the friendship. This isn’t an attack on you—sometimes we just can’t bear to see people we care about partake in destructive behaviors so we have to distance ourselves. 

She’s in an apparently abusive relationship. That doesn’t make her a bad person, it makes her a victim. You’re not obligated to be her friend or to try and get her to come to her senses. If you are able to keep that door open/not burn the bridge she may really appreciate the support if she ever wises up and leaves him. But that’s not something you are obligated to do. "
b65emq,NAH .I'm sorry you have to go through that. It's normal to be frustrated. just don't take it out on your sister.
b65eqh,"NTA

You are justified in your fears, it does seem like a suspicious situation. If you really think your friends could be ""pranking"" you, talk to them about it. Still, that's incredibly poor taste and you should still do the following:

Ask you parents about this, explain the situation. You could also go to you counselors, so that they can advise you accordingly"
b65jcb,"YTA

you are way too hung up on what your friend ""owes"" you."
b65kl1,"NTA. It’s a dumb joke, but not really offensive. "
b65kob,"YTA.

You're not small children having a sleepover. You're adults. It's perfectly reasonable for your girlfriend to be upset with you sleeping in the same bed as another woman."
b65lx1,"YTA. You're wrong, the server still gets that tip. It's not as common to tip in the UK but it does still happen and the tips do still go to the server, not just the owner's pocket. And it's not rude at all. Maybe things have changed in the last 14 years, or maybe you never had the right idea of tipping, but it certainly isn't rude and it doesn't just go to the owner. "
b65pb7,"YTA. Give this old guy some peace in his last years.  
Put *his*  wants and needs ahead of your own.  

When was his last geriatric checkup? Pain can make pets cranky."
b65pkd,NTA. Furthest from it. You did a good. <3 that joke was totally not okay.
b65sde,"Assuming this isn't SHP, YTA. You just told us a long story about how you became an addict over a fucking breakup and persisted to mooch off of others without working or contributing. And when you're finally called on it, you just block the people who helped you out.

> Can you really accuse someone who has nothing of being a sponge?! 

Of course. Do you think that only rich people can be mooches?

> I also began obsessively watching videos by Jordan Peterson 

Maybe you should watch them again because like 80% of his stuff is about getting your shit together and taking ownership over your problems."
b65tea,"~~ESH~~

~~You give away $125 a month and you got mad at your wife for giving away $200 a month? I recognize that the $75 is pretty big but judging by your post, it seems like you weren't telling her that you were giving money away either.~~ 

~~Also, if you guys are that tight for cash, neither of you are in any position to give money away.~~

EDIT: NTA

OP's wife is giving away $200 AT A TIME which is goddamn ridiculous.

Assuming the wife is giving away 150 (on average) every time, and does it at the same rate as OP (I'm assuming 5 times a month), that means the wife is giving away $750 a month. That's a shit ton of money."
b65us2,NTA Your moral argument makes sense. I can see why that’d be mildly frustrating from the drivers perspective but you can both walk fine so just park farther away. Walking is good for ya
b65vaq,"NTA. She has friends and family apparently. They can equally ""help her till the baby is born even if it isn't theirs.""

Edit: thanks for the gold!
Edit 2: and my first platinum.  Wow.  Judging people has been so rewarding today."
b65xk6,"NAH, but if you're an atheist, what difference does it make that you didn't like her? She's dead. The question is how much you like your living family members and make this time easier for them."
b65xu9,"NAH, not at all unless you're mean about it. Just let her know the indecision is making you uncomfortable."
b65znj,"ESH, you all sound super immature."
b6609l," NAH, your dad wants what is best for you, but it’s *your* education, it should be your choice. That said, moving to college with your hometown friend is generally a bad idea IMO. There’s nothing wrong with staying best friends, but I’ve seen time and again when kids go off to college with all their high school buddies and either never branch out and make new friends, or end up hating each other."

b668w3,NTA for doing your job. there’s a scheduled appointment time for a reason. 
b66anj,"Ehhhh, ESH, bordering on YTA. It all sounds like useless drama, and his reaction to your drama is more drama. If you need time to work through your shit, do it and don't involve others in psuedo relationships. If, as his text seems, is about social anxiety and calling him toxic(?) Then you should work on social skills with friends and not do this whole ""Get close, like someone, pull back and lament your psychological issues"" because that's just attention seeking behavior, intentional or not."
b66gr1,SHP please be a SHP. If not you need a new gf
b66jdo,"ESH. Dude sucks, but it's up to the women he's interacting with to decide how they feel, not be told by you.

You suck because you went full nuclear and also told a bunch of people their feelings and actions were wrong."
b66lrs,"NTA. His financial situation shouldn't determine whether he leaves his aggressive dog unsupervised. That's his problem to worry about now.

That said, if it truly doesn't set you back and you want to be the better person, just move forward. But there is nothing wrong with pursuing this to get that $280 from him. It was 100% his fault and you are entitled to pursuing him for the fees."
b66ngh,NTA I really don't think what you said was over the top at all. You stood up for your family and put her in her place. 
b66px8,"NTA. She's the mother, she should behave like one."
b66qk4,This seems more like a post for r/relationship_advice
b66sjr,"NTA but this sentence:  ""If I can go 5 hours without a cigarette, I think you should too."" Is disingenuous and you know it. I'm also curious as to where you are located, since 5 hours without a break seems a bit long. "
b66u1e,NTA. She's being selfish expecting you to stay in a low-paying job just because she currently benefits from you not having as much money as you could. Get a higher-paying job as soon as you can and move out as soon as possible. She doesn't want what's best for you. 
b66ucw,"YTA - but only for not hooking her up with food to eat since you took her meal plan for the week. 

Like I get the miscommunication that happened but you should have fixed that issue immediately and helped her out with some real food, guy. "
b66vv4,"NTA, if she can’t handle you having a boyfriend over this person is a drama queen, find a new roommate."
b66xwq,"Absolutely NTA, you bear no responsibility for her shitty driving nor for her not caring about the local driving laws."
b66xz1,NTA default to doing your job the safe way unless your manager tells you otherwise.
b671i8,"NTA

If your boss wants to pay you extra to support the grown adults in their job, your boss is free to do that. Not your job not your problem (especially if you are just faster and nobody is actually falling behind!) 

Expecting answers to questions and expecting physical assistance in tasks are two different things."
b673yy,"NAH - Updated due to additional info.

INFO. Assuming that you are in the US, a renter is generally responsible for the value of personal property in their rental unless the damage was caused by landlord negligence. That's why rental insurance exists. Are you the landlord? If you are, was the damages caused by your failure to maintain the property? If you are, and it was, you should refund your roommate the cost of the bottles. Otherwise, NAH, your roommate is justifiably upset at losing valuables, but you are not responsible for cataloguing your roomates' goods and saving the important stuff. "
b678lo,"NTA. The laws in the UAE are ridiculously outdated and I can't believe its 2019 and Americans (as well as other countries too of course) still openly support that country with tourism.

I was just browsing /r/legaladvice and saw this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b67d9i/got_caught_drifting_my_car_authorities_have/

This guy is being charged with ATTEMPTED MURDER and DESTRUCTION OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY for drifting in a car in an empty parking lot. That tells you a lot about the country."
b678ly,"No, you’re not the asshole. You have every right to reject someone, especially after they hurt you. You’re response is much politer than mine would’ve been."
b67brq,NTA- but very unwise. 
b67bxt,"NAH - Neither of you are in relationships, you’re not harming anyone, you’re both consenting adults, do your thing. "
b67civ,"YTA - she wasn’t saying you didn’t work hard. It was just verbal short-hand instead of listing off your personal accomplishments/struggles. 

You were being pedantic. For no real gain. Just to do it. "
b67daz,NTA - that’s a big ask and a huge deception. 
b67en5,"NAH - if you're gentle and honest with her.

She's your best friend and she asked that you be honest with her about this particular issue.  As long as you deliver this in a gentle, honestly-trying-to-help kind of way you're fine.

What's appropriate for close friends is different than for regular friends and is different than acquaintances."
b67g0g,"NAH for the dancing thing, but YTA for the drinks thing.

You actually go around the club and just pick up peoples drinks? Not only is it a dick move to steal someones drink, it's also weird and gross."
b67ghb,"YTA if you prioritize work before your family.  You requested off, it's not like you're coming in on a regular day off.  If anything, it'll show your manager that your requests off don't mean anything because you'll still come in if you're needed.  This is important to your wife."
b67go9,"YTA

You aren't the asshole for not asking your friend. What makes you the asshole is that you didn't tell her and she found out from a different source. You should have told her because you said you would think about it."
b67j80,"You're sort of the asshole. Migraines suck, and I can sympathize. But there are multiple treatments to try, and I'm sure your partner doesn't like seeing you in pain either. It's not fair to effect him (waking him up, etc) when you refuse to seek out treatments that may help you."
b67jm5,"ESH

Mostly I'd say it's just her style of work. And extra internships are great, because they will actually benefit you a lot when looking for a (good) job. So don't put her down for being hard working. Although the extra 11 pages do seem a bit weird to me, and her reaction to you pointing it out was over the top. Hence everyone sucks a little."
b67jqv,"YTA. Are you 14? Think about all the movies/magazines/instagram models that make women feel like they have to be perfect, giving them unattainable standards and ruining their self esteem. This happens to men, too. You are actively doing that to your SO with this immature behavior. (Lock screen pic? Seriously?) Have some respect for your boyfriend next time and take the Tiger Beat cut-outs down from your locker. "
b67jv5,"Why won't you just talk to her? If you know that for that long I think you owe her a chance to change her behaviour towards you and others and if she doesn't - at least an explanation of why you don't want to be close friends anymore.  
Edit: forgot to vote - I think if you ghost her without as much as an explanation - YTA."
b67o4n,NTA. You are advocating for your father who cannot speak for himself. I hope if I’m ever in his situation I have someone who takes care of me as well as you are taking care of him.
b67suc,"YTA -  you and every asshole that drives the left lane without passing should rot in hell.  

just bc there were 10 to 15 more assholes in front of you it doesn’t make you any less an asshole!!!"
b67tk6,NTA - but good luck getting him to pay for a mattress. Guy can’t even afford to pay for a place to sleep. 
b67ud3,NTA. There are reason you can't park within a certain distance from a stop sign. It's a hazard. You made an effort to find the owner. I wouldn't feel bad. Especially if it was there all day. 
b67var,NTA School is more important. You explained your situation and she made the decision to have it be all or nothing. She gave you a choice. You picked the better one.
b67vov,"NTA not only because it's your room too but because she has another microwave so it's not that difficult to ""cook"" somewhere else. Anyway, I don't know how you two get along but get ready if she's annoyed by this, some people are like that. "
b67xiq,Get over yourself dude. You experienced a wave of hormones because you nutted. BFD.
b67z3e,"NTA

1) You planned yours well in advance

2) 1 year old birthday's are entirely for the parents, not the child which makes this an even bigger asshole move on their part"
b67zql,"NTA. Take care of yourself. Mind your mental health. Your mum and dad should be able to take care of this without getting you directly involved. Choosing to take space instead of having a massive fall out is a self preserving decision and, given your struggles with anxiety and mental health, its a good one. "
b6877d,"NTA
just tell them your boss said to limit social visits "
b687m3,"NTA

First of all I think it’s a perfect illustration as to why homeschooling is a crap idea.

Secondly I think it’s good that you at least try to look out for Janes kids even though their idiot mother doesn’t. As you pointed out, one of them may end up pregnant or abused or whatever just from not knowing what’s going on."
b688du,"NTA.  If she doesn’t live with you, you’re more than within your right to not want junk in your house.  You’re not controlling her, she has her own place. "
b688j2,"NTA

Your mother needs to deal with her issues and come to terms with the fact that you are a human being, and not just an extension of herself. She sounds horrible and abusive."
b688qd,"NTA or NAH depending on how well you actually know your boss.

>Boss: ""They're not babies, they're in high school.""

>Me: ""Awe, but they'll always be your babies no matter how grown up they get"" chuckle

Did you completely miss what he was trying to tell you?

You're not an asshole, but I would expect you to be able to take the hint from what your boss said and stop pushing forward. Calling a 15 year old 'baby' comes across as highly unusual and creepy from my point of view, and you should be able to recognize that you're making other people uncomfortable."
b68900,[deleted]
b689gg,"Depends.

Did you and your brother have a long term plan in place for the house? Like fix it up to sell, or co-own it forever, etc? Being on a loan with someone is always tricky. 

I would suggest sitting down together and having a discussion about their plans and your plans. Don’t give an ultimatum because that always puts people on the defensive. Just ask where they see themselves with the house, and where your plans are going. If they don’t want to move or buy a different house then bring up wanting to free up your side to move on. 

You’re only the asshole if you don’t have a civilized conversation with them and drop your “this or that” in six months ultimatum right off the bat."
b68e33,"YWBTA, and here’s what I would personally do in your situation:

Get her something small. You don’t have to spend a lot, just enough for a card and a max 10-15 dollar item. Like, think a lotion from Bath and Bodyworks.

It’s rather impersonal, cheap, and you can avoid the drama associated with getting her nothing. And as a bonus: If she complains about the gift then *she’s* the one that looks like an ungrateful asshole."
b68hd0,"NTA

Your boyfriend needs to grow up quickly. He's got a child now, and he's acting like a toddler. Not a good look. I can see why he was annoyed that you told your sisters about the baby before you told him, but trying to ban people from the kid's life over it is over the top.

I think you need to work on your boundaries with your family, however. Random cousins showing up at the hospital without asking you first? Good for them, they just wasted gas+parking money. They should never have gotten in to see you."
b68ijk,"ESH.

Here's the truth, OP: you can claim all you like that your 'racist/offensive jokes' are not serious, but they're *still* harmful in ways you can't imagine. ""Just joking"" worms its way into your subconscious, and it's easy to start slowly believing all the terrible things you joke about.

Even if you don't believe all the racist/offensive things you're saying and joking about, the people around you cannot be expected to know your heart. The radical approach is to *stop making racist jokes*.

If this friend is important to you, go back to them and start an open dialogue. Understand that you do not have the capability to change someone's mind; you can only show them where you are and hope that they can walk their way towards you. Cultural pressures are hard to fight against; I certainly wouldn't want to be in your place.

Best of luck to you, OP, and God bless you. :)"
b68nk6,"NTA, but it’s not a fight worth fighting with the parents. Sounds like the type of parents to way overprotect their kid, and then the kid goes nuts the second they get a shred of independence."
b68nv7,"NTA

You have every right to have this conversation with him. Try to be as diplomatic and sympathetic as possible, but there are serious health and lifestyle ramifications to weighing as much as he does, and you have a right to express your concerns and tell him that this is important to you."
b68rvr,"YTA - like these people don’t have hard enough lives? Now they have to deal with the fallout from some uppity asshole complaining that they stink. 

This was a godawful, thoughtless thing to do. I hope when you need it most people treat you with more kindness and understanding than you’ve shown here. "
b68s23,"NTA, that's perfectly reasonable. Could you maybe negotiate so he only brings guys over when you're out at work? I'm trying to think of a solution where they have a safe place to go that doesn't bother you. "
b68t79,"NTA unless you're lying about your experience. If you're legitimately having shitty experiences, you had better believe that the management wants to know about it, and you're doing them a favor by telling them about it.

Restaurants can't correct their mistakes if no one tells them how they're doing. That's why companies literally pay people to take opinion surveys. That sort of data is worth a lot of money to them."
b68ugd,"YTA

>Last year, after several years of being out of steady work, [2 year relationship]

So, let me guess, your fiance supported you through this period of unemployment?

You have debt, her parents are paying for a lot of your wedding, and you take this money and blow it. I don't care that it's a cool little secret room, or if you gambled it away, or if you lit it on fire. Either way, you blew it.

And then you have the audacity to tell your future wife, the person you love the most in the whole wide world, to just suck it up and its YOUR house (even though she lives there and you're about to be married and share the house legally) to just sick it up through all the construction!?

I don't have to answer if you're the asshole here because it's going to hit you when you're alone in your little batcave at 3AM and cripplingly lonely and looking at her facebook posts where she's happily married with someone who actually appreciates her."
b68x6x,"NTA. She misread your intentions, then took rejection poorly, and rather than handling it herself she decided to fuck you over."
b68x87,"NAH as long as you're sure you're being friends with her because you value her as a friend, not just because you want to be with her romantically. if you are with her only for this, then you are really a nice guy and an asshole. and make sure you aren't expecting anything more from her just because you're being nice"
b68y3c,[deleted]
b68yi2,"ESH. If someone wants to stand, let them stand. Better thing would have been to let someone who wanted to sit ask for the seat. "
b691d8,"YTA, you say you are fine being friends with her, but you are basically telling her the friendship is over if she meets another BF. It's ok to *feel* this way, you can't really help that. But to tell her that will just make her feel shitty, and *definitely* isn't helping your case if you want to date her."
b6935m,"NAH, it's reasonable that you want your work/art to be just your own until you're comfortable sharing it. People give their own opinions and it can ""taint"" your project until the project is standing on its own. If the hubby keeps pressuring you I would say he's being an ass but if he's just really curious I understand that.

What you're working on are personal projects and it's okay to not want to share them until they're done."
b69acz,"NTA

If the other girl wants a nicer dress to be in the ensemble every other night, her mom or the director can make one."
b69by4,"NTA 

My mom has a bad habit of doing this with my weight and eating habits. I get up and leave when she starts. If she's at my house I tell her it's time to go.
She's not helping you and she's not trying to help you. She's for some reason trying to make you feel bad and you absolutely do not have to put up with that!"
b69dyz,"NTA. You were taking care of your sister's kids pro bono and she has the audacity to try to get you kicked out of your place for smoking weed, which is entirely your right to do so? I'd have told her to go fuck herself too. "
b69f7j,"NTA. im sorry you had to go through all that. you tried hard to keep that relationship going & that wasnt an easy thing to do.

you gave your dad way more chances than he deserved. i wouldnt listen to anyone that gives you a hard time for cutting him off, he had this coming"
b69g20,"ESH. 

So you're trying to get his truck cited because you don't like the look, but if it were a Santa Fe or a Tesla, you don't care? That's an asshole move. You don't even use street parking. 

He is an asshole for not parking his car in his driveway unless there is a good reason, like someone else shares it or his driveway has a structural issue. "
b69ji4,"Definitely NTA. For one, she needs to be on her meds from the sound of it. I don't know if that'll fix the hitting, but it's worth a shot. Second, from the sound of the title, I'm assuming you've already talked to your friend about this issue and they didn't take it well. From the description of the gf, she's definitely abusive, and he may be looking through rose-colored glasses."
b69pey,"YTA. The purpose of the horn is to get another driver's attention when needed, not to express your anger. It can startle people which could lead to unsafe driving, biking or pedestrianing. "

Holy shit, some of the posts on these sub though... Your adopted/step family is trash. Cut them out and be better off for it. Also, report the pregnant step sister who is still using drugs. "

b69umi,"YTA

If someone asks you to call 911, you call 911. Full stop."
b69xv0,"NTA. She didn’t want to listen to you. You tried to get her to listen to someone objective. If she believed you and supported you, you wouldn’t have needed to do that. "
b69zw6,"YTA. You can't tell a customer that, unless you plan on them not being a customer anymore. It's not your place.

If he's really disrupting business with his smell, you can tell him, but then he's got to go and not come back."
b6a0vj,"NTA- if she wants to have sex with other ppl, she should do the right thing and just break up with you. She’s pretty much just telling you she will cheat on you while she’s away. Save yourself the heartache and break up with her. "
b6a0x4,"NTA

You hardly know the guy, and he's not respecting you.  Stop dating him."

NAH as far as I can tell."
b6aesn,"YTA if you do this anywhere that isn’t private. You can ask her for a word alone, I don’t care how you do it, but calling her out is not considerate. "
b6agl8,NTA. What other option did you have in this scenario? It’s not like you just ditched it because you didn’t wanna go. 
b6akdx,"NTA.

You tried to be reasonable and he didn't want to be.

That said, I'd say if someone tells you to ""fuck off"" you should end the conversation there.

Wishing them a nice afternoon won't help and it'll just make them more upset. "
b6als9,"Well YTA but that’s a little too strong, you’re overreacting. It’s all fake obviously.. would you condescend someone with a Thanos tattoo? He’s surely killed more women and children than all the earthly wars combined. "
b6am6o,"NTA!!!!

I’m sorry you’re in this situation. Your mother is extremely ignorant and self centred. She is clearly not fit to educate your sister much less raise her. You might want to post this to r/legaladvice for some better help before taking any drastic actions though. 

Please get your sister into a better situation soon."
b6an3d,"NTA in my opinion. You are still going to the bachelorette party and you are not the maid of honor (I’m assuming) so you’re absence for one night shouldn’t be too disruptive. If you were going to the bar crawl solely to get blackout drunk, maybe you should prioritize your friend but you have a commitment to the organization as well so nta "
b6apgk,"NTA, you guys agreed on rules about introducing your kid to people you were dating, and he broke them. "
b6aqmg,"NTA.

“Can I sleep on your couch for 1 or 2 nights?”    - YES

“Can I live on your couch?”      - NO


Above are the responses of any sane and rational person. 

You need no justification, especially considering the circumstances you have detailed. "
b6au83,NAH. I understand both sides - but he wasn’t aggressive in his message to your brother and didn’t cause a huge family meltdown. I think this is one of those things better let go of. 
b6autj,NTA. That’s like a nail artist adding nail art or glitter and asking you to pay more when you asked for a basic mani. 
b6av79,"NTA

Seems like a lot of red flags all over the field... This entire situation seems very odd. "

>If this was a cellphone we're talking about, and she lost it, I think it would be just as big of a deal.

The cost of the item is irrelevant. Once it is confiscated, it is the responsibility of the *confiscator* to keep it safe until it is ready to be returned. "
b6azt1,"ESH

She (according to you) is crazy and obsessive so that makes her kind of a jerk to you and your friend if it’s how you describe. However you not only called her psycho, made a mean comment to her, were surprised when she had a negative reaction, and called her immature for actually trying to fix the issue. I almost wanted to call you the a hole but I’m gonna get downvoted. "

It’s understandable why it would make you upset. But I don’t think you should let it get to you. People make jokes to help themselves get over certain things and since being queer is still pretty stigmatized, this is one of the way.

You should have asked her first... or alternatively asked her if you could use it and tell her if she brings home another one for herself you will pay her the cost to replace it.

She told you it was not ok and you then demand her father discipline her for standing up to your stealing????  Thats not ok on so many levels.

I mean, you’re not an asshole per se for feeling that way. She’s not in any way an asshole - she broke it off with you, and then after that started dating this guy. It’s not her fault that you didn’t really accept the break up as a break up. Sure, she may have said “anything’s possible in the future” but it sounds like you expected it to happen. Which is different.

Long distance is hard. Especially across national borders. 

If you are upset or resentful that you “wasted” three years of prime dating on her, that’s really in you not her. Especially when it was someone you had never met in person.

I’m sorry for your situation, but she is behaving responsibly in this situation. It’s just hard on you."
b6biao,"YTA. Holy shit, yta. You purposely, publically, torpedoed them so you *could win competition later*. Not because you saw they were unhappy, not because one of them had done something the other should know - you sabotaged for your own gain.

Seeing as she sounds keen on having sex but it's not really working out right now, I'd say you need to find a different approach that works for both of you.

It's completely irrational, but normal for first relationships, and I think this may be along the lines of what's happening here. As for the bet, I have no idea what's up with that...but it would at least explain the sudden ""you'll need your own ride"" thing.

the house is equally both of yours, so you’re effectively roommates. you were responsible in knowing that you did not want to commit to a dog.

your dad committed to the dog. you’re both adults in a shared living arrangement, he shouldn’t be dragging you into his mess. if he can’t be the caretaker the dog deserves, it’s on him to either find a proper caretaker/dog daycare, or find the dog a better owner.

however: if the rent agreement isn’t official & it’s only your dad’s name on the deed/lease, he does have leverage in being able to go “it’s my house, what i say goes, help out or move out” you know the whole grumpy-entitled-parent-who-demands-respect-without-giving-any speech"
b6ct3w,"NAH

Listen, this is a really fucking hard situation and I really feel for you.  Ultimately its up to you to make the best decision for you and your kids, and I don't think there are any bad decisions to make as you believe you're doing whats best.

So obviously you know this, but it deserves to be said: you husband has a disease.  He's an alcoholic.  That doesn't excuse his actions, but it explains them.  It's an addiction, which is a mental health issue.  Obviously he has some agency and choice here, but the point remains.  Some people can deal with this themselves, some people can't.

With that said: while yes, he's your husband, that doesn't mean you need to sacrifice your and your kids well being to help him. You've spent 10 yeas with him and have been through this before.  You've done more than is morally required of you.  If you have the energy, the ability, and the interest to continue to help him, thats fine.  But if you don't then *that's perfectly acceptable too*.  Youve done and given so much already, it's okay for you to say enough is enough.

Again, this is a fucking hard situation to be in.  And obviously what he is doing is really shitty, but it's hard to say he's morally wrong for not being stronger than his addiction.  Yes, it would be better if he was able to, but I just can't call him in asshole for suffering from this disease.

Good luck.  Take care of yourself and your kids first, and know that that is all that you need to do."

b6d0t8,"NTA.  I usually shy away from telling people that their relationships are toxic based on so little information, but this is one of those times where if your story is accurate... your relationship is toxic.  He SHOULD be supportive.  He SHOULD take care of you when you're sick.  He should NOT get abusive when you make a mistake.  He IS being abusive.  When you feel better, you need to either have a very serious talk with him about how you are to be treated (and NOT to be treated) and physically pushing you is unacceptable... or break up.  Even if you didn't get any more birth control pills for days or weeks, your SO should value you for more than just something to have sex with.  Condoms are a thing, by the way, if it's that freakin' important to him.  I hope you feel better, and honestly I hope you end up with someone who will treat you with respect and kindness in the face of pain and suffering."

Sounds like you all have an unhealthy obsession with identity politics and what some would colloquially call the oppression Olympics. This argument is centered around an Internet argument. Look I love having discussions on the internet but I’m not going to drag it into a drama where I get into fights with my family over disagreements.

And honestly I don’t recommend arguing with people. You’re asking a genuine question so I’m giving you a genuine answer but I won’t argue about it. Why? A person convinced against their will is of the same opinion still. If you wanna convince people lead by example and when they say something you disagree with don’t agree but don’t harshly disagree. Say something like “I understand where you’re coming from I suppose” or “maybe” or “that’s one possible interpretation”. No reason to fight about it. It won’t change the world. If they ask give an honest answer but there’s definitely no reason to jump to the worst possible accusation. Far better to not make the disagreement personal."

I'm all for people making space for themselves if they feel that they're in a toxic relationship, but it sounds like your father is just sick and depressed and trying to be as comfortable as he can be.

b6k7sh,"NAH. You weren't doing it on purpose, but she has a right to be annoyed. In the future make sure ""Turn on phone sound"" is part of your oculus checklist"
b6ka0j,"NTA for asking this person not to sit next to you, but YTA a little bit for the way you're framing this issue. It's not that you don't want a fat person sitting next to you, it's that you don't want an obnoxious smelly person with a dysfunctional personal-space meter sitting *on* you. I suspect a fat person with better boundaries wouldn't have bothered your claustrophobia (or at least not as much), so I don't think it's really about this person's size."
b6kb4s,"ESH. Your boss is right in that it wasn't anyway to talk to your boss or address the repeated problem in a professional manner. I also get migraines/headaches from the overhead lights, but I have sat down and explained the medical reason they induce headaches and why I can't have them on. (Though I am lucky enough that my boss wouldn't do what yours did, ever.)

And your boss sucks for that. Sit down and ask how you can approach it. Ask him point blank if he can refrain from doing this in the future, and if he can't, man, GTFO out of that job. Shitty boss if he can't."
b6kb7d,"YTA but not a huge one. 

If I got on a bus and the only seats left were the priority seats, I'd stay aware of who was getting on the bus so that I could give up my seat if needed."
b6kfqy,"NTA 

Sounds like regular teenage “ I called dibs on her already!” 

He needs to realize that he can’t own someone and he can’t control certain social settings "
b6kgj6,YTA self deprecating jokes are one thing but to have your partner poke fun at your weight is another matter entirely. Take any part of your physique that you’re dissatisfied with and imagine him making fun of it to your face and think about how you would feel.
b6kgm1,NTA- she was parking in a spot she wasn't supposed to and it was going to negatively impact you. especially since she blocked two spots
b6km16,"NTA. It's not like Stacy was a little kid, she's 13. Can clearly understand what it means to not touch something. And the doll has serous sentimental value to both you and your daughter. Your coworkers is being ridiculous, spreading rumours about you around the office. "
b6kppv,"YTA if you just make a huge financial decision without even considering your husbands point if view and talking about it a hell of a lot more. Sometimes job do suck and you have to make due. Look for a job now, but if you don't find one comparable then you probably need to go back to the old one for a while. It's not far to just tell your husband you're not going back."
b6ktci,YTA. Don't go out to eat if you can't tip. Eat out once less and use the money you save to tip the next.
b6ktjo,"NTA

Either Robert is TA for not understanding the key isn't his, or whoever told him he can take it. Also Karen is TA if she didn't even ask him to come home and just answered ""he can't come, he's having dinner"" in his place."
b6ku2f,"NTA it’s your cat, you’re besties. Some people don’t seem to understand that pets aren’t always just pets, they are family. I support you keeping your cat. You know the risks and you’re an adult."
b6kwb4,NTA but you might make your point if you speak Korean to her. Make her realize you can’t assume people don’t understand. It’ll probably embarrass her and make her think twice next time
b6kx29,"NTA. Definitely not the asshole. And it isn't unreasonable to not want to pony up for a destination wedding (that's part of the point of a destination wedding, to weed out people without having to be awkward about it) If your sister starts like begging you to go, you should have a real conversation about why you don't want to go, but taking the easier/socially expedient out of not wanting to spend the money is fine."
b6kx88,"NAH you're not obligated to do anything, but if you're up for it, you might want to see what you can do about getting her some psychological help. If she's struggling with paranoia and narcissism, she could definitely benefit from that. Maybe discuss with some friends who are also aware of the problem and want to help. But again, you're not obligated to do that, you're not responsible for what happens to her."
b6kxl3,"ESH.  It is a good lesson about messing with stuff that belongs to other people.  More often than not, it will escalate to the point where someone gets offended or pissed off."
b6l06k,YTA - Should have given the shoes back when they didn’t fit you. Shouldn’t have called a friend who lined up for 40 minutes and thought of you after not being able to get shoes in her size. Not cool dude. 
b6l1j1,YTA. You totally breached her privacy. She deserves to know.
b6l2ww,"NTA. You should never be put in a situation in which you have to lie, or keep things from one of your parents. "
b6l4mg,"ESH. Everyone be kinder and more respectful to each other, whether you're a parent or a child. Responding with sarcasm in a tit-for-tat situation is only going to escalate things. Curious, did you buy that laptop without your parents help?"
b6lbwt,"NTA - there is a reason none of her siblings will take this on and it's not that none of them have a spare room.  They are all old enough to know that once you let her move in, she will never leave and you will be stuck caring for her for the next 20-30 years or so.  If that doesn't appeal to you (and there's no reason why it should), then you are just being sensible by avoiding it in the first place."
b6lc5j,"NTA - you don’t have to respect their shitty habit. Also, fuck your “friend” for being a dick about it. There’s no reason to taunt someone that way. "
b6lgse,[deleted]
b6lhm7,"~~NTA- I feel like most people would have gone snooping in this situation, yet you were up front and asked. She did not need to freak out (you said she was ""PISSED"" just by you asking) and could have just calmly explained that she did not feel comfortable with it. Her emotional reaction makes me think that there is more to the story.~~

EDIT: After reading the update/post edit... I'm going with ESH. I still hold on to what I said before, but now I feel like OP kinda sucks too for how he asked.

&#x200B;"
b6llc4,"NTA - Even with a police escort, they're not supposed to block and slow traffic.   The idea is to get the to the burial site on time, not for them to have a parade. "
b6llsd,"NTA.  Except that you wouldn't want to lie to him about it, you'd want to be very upfront and honest with him about telling them.

You told them because you cannot handle his addictions on your own, and he can either get over it or GTFO.

You, OP, should also consider therapy for how to deal with a SO that's an addict; they're extraordinarily manipulative and can be quite cruel if they don't get their way.   Best if you see the games, lies, lies and manipulations coming ahead of time so you know better how to deal with them. 

Good luck!"
b6lmmr,"YTA, he likes you and he will still be there in a month, just explain the situation to him, he’d be heartless if he didn’t understand why you can’t make it."
b6ln72,NTA you are setting them up for a successful future. Sounds like you love them very much.
