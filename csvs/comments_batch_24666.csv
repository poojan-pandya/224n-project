b6lnyj,"You know you're a single mother, right? "
b6lo0o,"NAH

But you will be YTA if you keep making it awkward. Your cousin just likes the name, so he took it as the new identity. There is already a nickname compromise in place. All good."
b6loir,"I feel like if OP was pukey drunk, he’s probably leaving out some of his behavior. From his story, NTA. In real life, probably ESH."
b6ltye,[deleted]
b6lva2,"NTA, these people seem like they're terrible
"
b6lzuq,"NTA, as this is obviously silly behaviour from your employee, who was given lots of chances to abide by a reasonable policy. Buuuut:

> track pants,loose t shirts, sheer clothes that showed her nipples, sleeveless blouses and yoga pants

""Sleeveless blouses"" are not revealing or inappropriate wear for women in a professional environment.
"
b6lzze,YTA you probably lack personality because of your insecurities and are projecting that onto your two friends. Maybe instead of focusing on what you think they're doing wrong try some self reflection. 
b6m55v,"NTA.

Your roommate clearly has some misconceptions about how dorm life works.  There are ways to go about dealing with a situation like this, and assuming you're being truthful with your story, she's out of line.

As an aside...  Voice record next time she starts saying she wants to choke you or some shit like that.  Get a new room.  She's a danger to you, and the waking you up at all hours is literally a torture technique."
b6m61t,"YTA

If you are not actually fat then stop calling yourself fat to your plus sized friend!  She probably knows that she needs to lose weight and probably more than you do, so when you're commenting on *how fat* you are it probably makes her feel like shit.  Just as a note, 70 lbs over 1/2 your weight. "
b6m9uv,YTA. You were extremely petty. 
b6mbzb,"NTA, your parents are toxic, plain and simple.  You shouldn’t feel bad about separating yourself from toxic people in your life."
b6mf3i,"Asshole?  No.  Weird?  Creepy?  Yeah, probably."
b6mgal,"NTA. It's not your job to hold her hand during class. You were being perfectly cordial, you don't have to be bubbly and instantly friends with everyone you meet. "
b6mhtz,[deleted]
b6mjbw,"YTA. 

>I had my headphones in as I was working because that's how I work best, so I didn't know that she was just giving out all of the answers on a powerpoint behind me.

So you weren't paying attention in class the way you should have been. 

>""Oh were you really checking or COPYING the whole thing?""

You didn't ask her if you could confer with another student, are you really surprised that she asked you this?

The issue here is that you need to be paying attention in class and communicating with your teacher about her expectations. For all she knows you copied everything without showing your work. 
"
b6mjur,"YTA - you're likely to get mixed responses on this - there was another thread on this like a week ago and thoughts were mixed. I find it rude to go to a wedding and not give a gift - you don't have to give as as big of a gift as you would if you weren't traveling but it's tacky to give nothing. Like was mentioned in that thread you they likely have multiple things on their registry for less then $50.  Also, your other personal expenses like nails and hair are not relevant imo - it's something you've chosen to have and do. "
b6mkgw,"YTA

Reason #1:  You call his girlfriend his ""sex worker girlfriend"" as if that's a bad thing.  It's a job and it's how she's chosen to earn a living.  Sometimes, people don't have a whole lot of choice.

Reason #2: You're not the legal guardian here.  If her Mom wants to keep her away from the hospital, then that's her right - but you generally get no say so in this situation.  This reads like the adults in this little girl's life are having a pissing match rather than recognizing that her father may very well be dying - and y'all are going to deprive her of the chance to say goodbye because you're pissy with each other.
"
b6mlnz,NAH. What are we to are partners if not personal BO checkers. 
b6mmwn,NTA. It’s important for your healing process to feel like you have control over your environment and she should respect that. 
b6mnxw,"NAH. FYI, she already listened. What you want her to do is to **obey** your opinion on her pregnancy. Demanding that would make you an asshole. "
b6moh6,NAH. As some one who had the same issue with their father he is honestly trying to protect you as much as he can from the pain. I'm sorry you are going through this and your feelings are valid. Call him but not angrily and tell him you know. 
b6mpqb,"YTA

There is no acceptable reason to make someone else stand so that your bag can sit on a seat. The fact that you are spineless and have been 'scammed' for your seat is not an excuse. The fact that you refuse to feed yourself is not an excuse. If your diet is making you act like a shitty person, perhaps it's time to make some serious life changes."
b6mvqj,"YTA

just put a tenner in a red envelope or some shit, not paying is sending a message that I don't think you wanna send.  Just pay a little."
b6mwj4,"NTA

Honestly, she already violated the terms of the contracted by going beyond the time frame of 60-90 days.   You've already been far more patient than I would have been (call me a typical american, but I would have had that photographer's ass in small claims court by now.  You don't get to jerk around paying clients without so much as an explination for the delay)"
b6n03y,"YTA...surprising someone with a car is something that should only happen on commercials. also she’s right, talk your problems out"
b6n21q,"NTA You're not his caretaker, he's a leech. Best thing you could do at this point is cut your losses and kick his ass to the curb, he's had plenty of chances."
b6n3lt,[deleted]
b6n3sf,"She was fired because she’s a terrible teacher, insensitive and unable to adequately handle a class of little humans. Not because you reported her on her behaviour. NTA"
b6n7t7,ESH. Both of you should know that you likely won’t be friends after this anymore 
b6n7xw,"NAH.

You were doing the right thing by letting someone know about a potentially embarrassing photo. She reacted and got upset... which is perfectly natural! People are emotional beings, and emotions are not rational. 

Don't be offended by her response. How she took it is on her; you didn't do anything wrong.

Best of luck, OP, and God bless you. :)"
b6nee9,"NTA. If your grandfather has a problem with your own personal style, that's *his* problem. You aren't wearing profanity-covered shirts or anything inappropriate, he doesn't have grounds to try and tell you how to maintain your facial hair. "
b6nfwu,"NAH 

The title was really biased. You call him your best friend which makes it sound like your best friend chose someone else over you, but you’re barely still friends at all. You’re not an asshole for not going and he’s not an asshole for not choosing you because you aren’t close. I know you said he isn’t close with his cousin either, but his cousin is his family. "
b6ngl9,"YTA. The fake response is likely a corporate mandate, not the employee's choice. However, you are choosing to be rude for something that isn't their fault."
b6ngvn,"Nta - if the 3 of them wanted to hang out and talk shop, they can do that - by themselves. If they invite you, they should include you. I always find it infuriating when this happens in social situations - find some common ground topics so everyone is included. "
b6njst,"NAH - I understand that your brother would like some money to live a little bit more comfortably, anyone would. But you are also in no way obligated to send him money. If your mother is so adamant about sending him money, she's free to do that herself. It is her child after all, not yours. It feels good to hear you still enjoy talking to him though, it's easy to lose contact when someone you know goes to jail. I don't know how long he has to be in there, but if it is a year or longer you could try and visit at least once or twice a year. He's still human too you know? If the long drive puts you off, make it a weekend out! Go swimming, stay at a nice little hotel or go to a local theme park :) I hope it helped, good luck!"
b6nlep,"NTA

People really need to get over it being a cardinal sin to go through a partners phone when they have legit suspicions of infidelity."
b6nlkr,Yup. This sums it up.
b6nlq8,"NAH. You're not an asshole for wanting to chat and spend time with her. However if she feels like she needs to nap, you can't stop her, so let her nap."
b6nqj7,NTA. Maybe this will teach him not to put stuff in spaces that don't belong to him. 
b6nsnd,"Nta. Unfortunately a lot of the older generations don't respect authority in younger people. Sounds like he needed a reality check. And no one should speak to you like that, at all. "
b6ntzz,"NTA. Let’s be real. It’s not “his brother is a white supremacist” it’s “HE is a white supremacist.” Be done with that shit.

Also just NTA because if you don’t want to be with someone you shouldn’t be with them. That doesn’t make you an asshole. "
b6nvzn,"YTA - if they’re not married, why should the baby have his name? It’s her child as well; why doesn’t your brother take HER name?"
b6ny01,"ESH.

Friendships end. Both of you are trying to hold on via drama. Stop and move on."
b6nzv9,"NTA

She seems incredibly toxic, and I think you need to stop enabling her terrible behavior. Counseling might also be in order for either her or both of you. "
b6o0ic,"NTA.

Mom kicked me out when I was wasting space at 21. Motivated me to get my life in order and, many many moons later, I appreciate that she had the wisdom to realize that so long as she was enabling me to be a loser, I would be.

(Would have been allowed to stay if I had been in school, but I wasn’t and was working a string of shit jobs)"
b6o0vo,"NTA

Your husband made a real bad move.  I've been with my wife while she was in labor, and I would've done anything I could to speed that up.  Labor looks terrible."
b6o1zx,NAH it’s not like you can call dibs or something 
b6o4dq,NTA - I think you handled this situation well.  Didn’t get angry or escalate. 
b6o6nt,YTA - I’m sorry but for all you know he just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I don’t think you should have reported it. 
b6o9um,NTA- you felt unsafe and probably for good reason. it was a good idea to call security. who knows what could have happened otherwise
b6oaiu,"NAH, it’s good that they are compassionate but you shouldn’t feel obligated to help them."
b6obgn,"NTA! You guys haven’t combined finances. It’s your money, you don’t even have to pay for half if you don’t want to. "
b6ojcz,"NTA 

You did the right thing by being honest and saying no. It would have been an asshole move to string him along even if you had no intention of buying from him. "
b6oki3,NAH You are trying your best to be helpful. That’s the best support she could have. She is also pregnant and pregnancy hormones are a thing. Take the licks. But don’t let up for her sake and the sake of your child. 
b6ol58,"ESH, but him more than you.

Him: ""he loves calling you fat""? ""He knows it hurts me so he says it""? Girl, that's not a healthy relationship at all.

You: You shouldn't have dipped to his level with this. Just stop replying to him, move your stuff out when you get back home (or kick him out when you get back home).

It sounds like this relationship has been dying for a while, and it took some chores to get it to blow up.

It was a struggle to label this. You're definitely NTA, but I wouldn't put the blame solely on him, considering your reaction. Yes, I know you were defending yourself, but at that point... Ugh. Sorry."
b6om6g,NTA this also sounds like r/choosingbeggars
b6omqk,"NTA. No offense, but your father sounds very rude. He should have respected your wishes and just left it at that, instead of getting angry and calling you selfish. "
b6ot2s,[deleted]
b6ot38,"NTA

Let him know. Better to get it out of the way now, then later on when it is worse"
b6oy4m,NTA. You're entitled to your sexuality just like he is.
b6oyyc,"NTA.  They shouldn't be pressuring you to see your texts.  That is a complete invasion of privacy.  Stand your ground, they don't need to see your text messages."
b6p4bj,"> growing out of Pokemon

> laughing at Marvel memes

Dude, it's all the same level of maturity."
b6p7eu,"NTA please take to heart what I'm about to say. This is direct insight to your boyfriend's character in a bad situation. Ask yourself if this is a man you can depend on. When someone shows you who they are you should believe them. Him being this cavalier about a serious medical issue should be eye opening for you. He doesn't sound like a ""ride or die"". In my last relationship I had a legitimate family emergency and my girlfriend at the time utterly failed at supporting me. I knew how serious the situation was and how little she cared but I tricked myself into thinking that didn't reflect on her character when it absolutely did."
b6p9af,"NTA

>broke up on neutral terms

Guess it wasn't so neutral afterall. Sounds like she's still got a chip on her shoulder. You shouldn't talking with your ex anyway. "
b6pbx1,"NTA.  Honestly, I don’t know why’d she want to risk it.  I would run out of the building at even the mention of lice.  As a female, lice is much harder to get out your hair.  I think there must be another reason she is really pushing to go."
b6pcvo,"YTA and I say this as an atheist myself, you weren't looking for a debate, you were looking to embarrass him and make yourself feel superior. "
b6phfz,[deleted]
b6pkiz,"NAH. She wasn’t obliged to sleep with you. You and her weren’t together so she also had no obligation to not sleep with someone else. 

However, it’s clearly going to be a sticking point for you. You broke up with her and that’s your choice. Especially if you feel like You won’t be able to get over the fact that she slept with her roommate that night. "
b6pls9,NTA but just taking blocking as a good sign that you aren’t compatible with someone and don’t need them in your life.
b6pofz,"NAH really, but it’s a bit a stretch to want someone to fly over and bring you pizza with them. Maybe if they picked it up in your town on their way to your house. From another city is ridiculous. You shouldn’t have kept pushing."
b6pos1,"NTA - I would understand if she made a comment about the boy being handsome to point him out to you, but her further actions... yeah that’s creepy"
b6psyb,"YTA, but oddly, you are being an asshole to yourself. You are getting used to a lifestyle you can't sustain under your own power; unless your parents are ludicruously rich, this means you'll develop spending habits that mean you'll sink into debt faster than other people in later life when you have burned through whatever your parents leave you as your inheritance. 

If you want to do yourself a favour, learn to budget. "
b6py5d,"You said you had a gift for her and then handed her a toothbrush. I don’t think you’re an asshole, but you goofed pretty well on this one. "
b6py61,[deleted]
b6q31i,"NTA - you paid money to watch a performance and were blocked by someone’s hair. It’s almost irrelevant that it was an Afro. Some old white woman with a huge up-do would be just as inconsiderate. 

And you definitely are NOT a racist."
b6q3i7,"NTA. Block her number, her Facebook and don’t contact her again is a pretty direct instruction. You’re just following what she told you to do, she can’t be mad at that. "
b6q6le,NTA. Tell her to put on her big girl panties and drive herself or take an Uber 
b6q775,"NTA

...Dude. He broke your phone."
b6q8t4,"NTA, your wedding is for you. Someone else acting like they are entitled to your ceremony for some reason is just silly as hell honestly. They aren't part of your relationship."
b6q94s,"NTA, sounds like she can't handle the fact that she was/is addicted to a worse drug, when some people know they are wrong all they can do is be shitty. That sucks."
b6qc9h,"YTA the polite thing to do with backpacks on crowded public transport is to take them off. Especially when they are at head height to others. Also, the weight thing was a dick move and you know it."
b6qd5i,This is not a matter of are you the Asshole it a matter of you will owe the money. You lived in the apartment and allowed the damage to take place and knew they did not pay the extra money. Life lesson don't do it again.
b6qddk,"YTA if you didn't give Jane the chance first, but NTA if she refused and you told him. 

Damn. This sucks. You would not be an asshole to do that. In fact, youd probably be more of an asshole if you said nothing. Although I think you should tell Jane first so she has the chance to tell him herself because she will seem more genuine that way. If you go in all guns blazing it will not be fair on either of them. 
"
b6qdm1,"NTA, he was purposefully egging you on, making fun of your job. You said one thing and he can't handle it? Lmao, he really needs to shut his ass up or get over it. Don't dish what you can't take."
b6qdyn,[deleted]
b6qek7,"NTA- So here’s the thing. Sounds like the guy was blatantly told the rules. If he is just contacting the females and not the males, and he’s straight, he has other intentions. It’s not about having Aspergers, it’s about being compliant in a safe space so everyone feels comfortable. He’s not doing that. If he’s not following the rules he needs to go. "
b6qeyy,"NTA. He’s being a bit childish. I hope this is the type of thing he will wake up tomorrow and forget about. It’s not like you were out having drinks with your ex until 2AM. 

Congratulations on a successful fundraiser!!"
b6qfjn,"NTA, if seeing you that much is soooo important she can make a trip or two. 

Honestly as someone who went through a similar situation in the military you might be best just cutting ties now. If she can’t handle a few weekends away from you bet she’ll find a Jody when you deploy. "
b6qgvk,"NAH// As my beautiful mother once said "" Honesty is the best policy"" "
b6qjad,[deleted]
b6qlgb,"YTA

You flipped out and called her a cunt, which to a lot of women, is one of the worst words that can be used against them.  You didn't really even do it for a valid reason - You did it because you lost your temper.
"
b6qnhe,"NTA.  He's crossing lines of appropriate conversation, and I'd imagine you're not the only one uncomfortable with it.  Trans or cis, that's not a conversation you just have without asking people for permission first."
b6qoyy,"NTA. Although you did handle the situation poorly. You basically confronted a potential violent abuser while he was having a hard grip on a potential victim. Despite being drunk and despite him seeming to have been drinking, there is no telling what he could have done. He could have snapped and punched her causing permanent damage before you could have reacted. He could have snapped and attacked you. If you have any kind of army training, you should know that intel is key and going into a dangerous situation without knowing the combat ability of a potential enemy is not a good idea. 

If you can't get the victim 1 on 1 then don't confront. She's never gonna say she's being abused in front of her abuser. Find some way to identify them, like the licence plate of their car or something and then notify the cops and CPS. You not only handled the situation poorly, but you also put the potential victim in a highly dangerous situation. Secondly she could very well be on the receiving end of a much heftier beating when they get home. Abusers often become increasingly violent if they risk exposure. "
b6qoz7,Nope. It might be the best place for him to be when you do. 
b6qqjv,"NTA On behalf of one of two latinas in a graduating class of around 200ish white people who enjoyed calling us beaner, spic, wetback, and got assaulted on camera at school where the admins shrugged it off. 

Thank you. This is how you be an ally. "
b6qryz,"YTA

If you have no reason to think your GF was cheating, asking for a paternity test is tantamount to accusing her of cheating. "
b6qun3,"NTA. 

I would kick her ass out the moment she said you have money so that means you don't got emotion bullshit. Catch me outside with that shit man. "
b6qz73,"YTA, at least a little bit. You are asking her to do all the mental labor of figuring out what needs to be done and assigning it and making it happen, while you just do the physical labor. It isn't fair to her. She is right that you are an adult who should know what a mess is and what needs to be cleaned. If you can't, apologize at least and acknowledge that she is doing additional labor to provide you what chores you need to do."
b6r436,"NTA

Welcome to management.  The first rule is, get used to people talking trash about you, but keep that bar high.

You did your job, properly.

"
b6r7lp,"NTA and I hate to break this to you, but I doubt he has any plans for marriage."
b6rb5w,"YTA

everyone knew that wasn't a joke.

edit: in future, you will look like less of a weasel if you don't lie about this stuff. ""It was just a joke"" is widely known to be bullshit. Either double down and own up to having called her a thot and meaning it; or genuinely reflect on yourself, own up to it, and apologize if you felt it to be wrong. Own your shit - good or bad. "
b6rd2l,"NTA - it's your cat. Boots can get his/her own cat if they desire, their mental health is not your burden."
b6rf6z,NTA. I would be very uncomfortable in that situation to say the least. 
b6rh75,YTA for telling him you hope he dies alone and then wondering why he won’t reply to you. Also you probably should’ve just heard him out from his side so you could make a judgement based on both sides of the story. 
b6rhqx,"NAH. Call her. Explain the whole situation to her. Let her know that as soon as you can afford it, you’ll fly out to see her. Promise her, and stick to it. "
b6rlxa,"NTA, it wouldve been illegal for you to posses them as well"
b6rlyg,"ESH This Aaron kid sounds like a piece of work, who knowingly trades shoes that they borrowed and then ruins the ones they received? You're stuck between a rock and a hard place, give the shoes back to the OG owner, pressure Aaron and never trust him again."
b6rncx,NTA. That is straight up animal abuse. You should take that dog  far far far far away from that household ASAP.
b6romg,"NTA - you did what you could to respect their relationship. It's not your fault he had feelings for you and lied about it. That's on him. I'm sorry your friends have ousted you over this

Edit: autocorrect correction"
b6rowb,I thought you had to be older than 13 to be on reddit. 
b6rrff,YTA because your coming across as a jealous boyfriend.  It doesn’t sound like it’s about the money sister.
b6rrv0,"NTA. Your sister very much so. Your niece I will give a pass since she is 4 however I wish she has a better role model.

Your guests can't come over to your house and dictate things. Your sister is completely in the wrong. Next time she pulls this move I wouldn't even invite her unless she realizes the dog won't be put away and she has to be fine with that."
b6rs2g,"NTA. Porn use is fine, but using the pictures of the same girl repeatedly is...it seems more personal, or something."
b6rtgu,"ESH. Don’t offer to pay for something you can’t afford. Don’t tell her not to worry about paying you back and then ask to be repaid later. 

Here were your other options:
1) Ignore the fact that she doesn’t have money and go enjoy your lunch. 
2) Offer to pay for her meal at a specific place that you know you can afford( ex: Taco Bell.) 
3) Tell her you are happy to front her the money for lunch and she can pay you back later. (Setting up a clear expectation for being repaid)

HOWEVER, she is still rude not to pay you the money after you have explained your circumstances. 

You kind of put yourself in this awkward situation.  You weren’t clear regarding your expectations and allowed her to take advantage of you. "
b6ryyw,"ESH, I don’t know why she ghosted you but if you really cared about her why would you respond to that by ghosting her back? You might be a passive introvert but this is juvenile levels of passive-aggressiveness. Take some initiative and ask her out to lunch or something. “Hey, it seems we’ve both been so busy lately and I would really love to catch up with you! Would you like to come over to my place for dinner sometime next week?” It’s not that hard. "
b6s03t,"INFO seems like a very strong reaction for no reason.

Therefore I'm suspicious of whether you are even aware of your own behaviour and how potentially irritating/insufferable you are.

Possibly you're NTA and you just have shit friends."

b6s14q,"YTA - forced sterilization is immoral and has been the subject of many a court case over the decades. pretending that you're applying an objective lens to something so repugnant is boring pseudointellectual edgelordiness of the nth degree. 

the devil doesn't need any more advocates, kid. you're an asshole."
b6s1l0,"NAH. Having a family member who is autistic is hard on everyone. They cannot control themselves and it changes how you live your life. Your feelings are valid, and it's actually pretty normal for people in your position to feel that way."
b6s271,"NTA - Good for you for saying what everyone thought to your actual boss.  A good boss welcomes feedback and input.  Plus, you were absolutely right!"
b6s2p7,Cool. You prefer the silence of no fucking tip at all.
b6s3jh,"NTA. Your life is hella stressful right now and if you can't find the time to go there, then you can't find the time to go there. It won't magically appear because they said please, you know? Also, NTA for telling them how you feel. You have to tell them that they're putting more stress on you with this routine and as much as you would like to visit, school just can't let that happen right now. Good luck with it, mate."
b6s4is,"No..?

NAH. If you want to have a threesome and feel like you need permission from strangers to even talk to your bf about kissing someone... yeah good luck with that."
b6s4lk,"ESH - This guy is a leech, you’re right.  But maybe give him a heads up that he needs to give an answer or you’re not going to put his name on it.  That way he has a chance and isn’t blindsided. "
b6s53q,YTA. You shouldn't gate keep being transgender. 
b6s66d,NTA. Thats the best way to transition into being good friends is by making sure all those other feelings are definitely not there anymore. You probably need time to heal before jumping into a friendship. 
b6sbu7,"NTA, you are completely right. If I were you I'd report this guy to youth group, he is not safe to be around young people. The reason men his age prey on girls your friends age is because they're easy to manipulate and prey on and you're right to see through it "
b6sgeb,"NTA

Sounds like your friend both neglected the relationship and even used you to some extent. 

Very reasonable grounds to want to end that connection. "
b6sgx0,"NTA, you'll never see a single cent back if you give this guy anything.  Best case scenario its an MLM.  Worst he needs a fix."
b6shz2,NAH. But odd hill to stand on. 
b6siu4,NTA. This is your wedding and you should invite who you want to it. Asking someone to invite not just one but THREE extra people to your wedding is ridiculous. 
b6slst,"I think NTA, sometimes people need to know the line they crossed. Unfortunately sometimes you have to let them know in a ""asshole"" way.  Jokes are always fun and me and my bros go at each other like we're not even friends but amongst the group we know who doesn't play like that so we dont crack jokes at them. Hopefully she comes around or maybe you two can joke back and fourth."
b6smcs,god please no not another tipping post
b6snvb,"NTA. 8:30 pm is a decently good time to be done. But I suggest investing in those foam floor pieces, they absorb most of the sound! That kind of noise comes with living in an apartment."
b6sp22,My parents say it’s petty of me to want to ask for compensation for the rubiks cube but I think its just right for me to do so
b6srdz,"NTA

As long as you don't have a SO."
b6sty5,"NAH. Grief does terrible, horrible things to us and makes us say terrible, horrible things. I'm so sorry your family is going through this."
b6su11,NTA- family isn’t just about blood but about actions. Your sister won’t be missing family at her wedding if that’s how they’re acting
b6sv7d,YTA. You have a baby. Do you expect your wife to deal with all of that ? Do you get to sleep peacefully for 8 hours all through the night while your wife has to get up several times for the baby? That's not fair. Not having the full recommended 8 hours of sleep is normal with a newborn. 
b6sw3w,NTA. You don't have to be connected at the hip to someone just because she's your best friend. You are your own person.
b6t16f,"NAH. I get your side. I love having a window open. But my window is hidden by bushes or on the second story. 

I get her side. There’s a difference between a closed window that’s probably locked and an idea being formed by seeing an open one. There have been multiple serial killers who said that their system was finding an unlocked door. It was an invitation in their minds. 

I don’t have a solution for you. Obscuring the window? Only opening it a crack so it’s not obvious? A screen? I don’t know, but you both have a valid side. "

I’d like to add that I’ve read some of your other responses to posts and it sounds like your roommate’s reaction to this situation is pushing her into the asshole role. The fact that your dog got attacked and you’re sitting at the emergency vet apologizing to her while she is mad at you for not texting her is completely uncalled for. And the fact she hasn’t called to check on Milo is upsetting. Hopefully she thinks things through and can apologize for her faults in this too. "

People deal with emotions different ways, and she needs to accept that.

In fact, ask her if she could ""just not feel bad about what she said."" When she looks at you like you're stupid, tell her it's the same thing. You can't not feel a certain way, and it takes time to reset the emotional level."

My initial thought while reading was that she might not have realized that what she said was hurtful and that you both needed better communication there. However, it looks like you’ve already tried to talk to her about it and she blew you off, which is not a good sign. 

You’re not the asshole, and it’s up to you to decide if it’s a deal-breaker for the friendship or if you decide to forgive them later on. "

Yo, imagine the genders were reversed and you were a girl. A boy makes you severely uncomfortable by smelling you without your permission, then (presumably) tells his parents that you two are dating.

Anyways, she gave you her word and broke it. So NTA.

(Congratulations on your research!) "
b6un7c,"YTA - let me help break this down for you.

>Im 17 , I’ve had a crush on this girl for 3 years. She’s ruined me mentally and emotionally. She is very extraverted, and talks to many guys. She’s told me that she see’s them all as friends. With her being an introvert, Id always get jealous. When I told her I liked her and if she would consider dating (after 1 year of knowing her), she rejected and said it wasnt me, she didn’t want to date in high school. So I decided to wait till the end of school. 

She didn't ask you to wait, she can date who she wants. You're expecting too much.

>I’d been the best person I could to her, I treated her with so much care. But it seemed that she’d never noticed. She’d always hang out with guys that have been assholes to her. I’ve confronted them to her request for treating her like shit. Yet, she’d hang out with them again like they were best friends. Just to clear something, she’s not the slutty type that has sexual needs, she’s quite the opposite and is against things like that. But regardless, Ive never understood this, and my jealousy grew. 

Being a 'nice guy' doesn't automatically mean a woman should date you and even if that was the case it comes across like you're expecting stuff in return for just being decent.

>I reached my breaking point when she dated a guy she barely knew that had came to our school for a month  (after me waiting for 2 years to date her). I felt like all the waiting, treating her with so much care, and fighting the pain of jealousy was useless, I was shattered. She never noticed until I told her the relationship was going to kill me (literally) and I had to distance myself. We both go to a small high school (200 ppl), and we are in all the same classes. So I had to see them together everyday. She got mad at me and told me I wasnt being fair and that she still wanted to be my friend...  She didnt help me with my pain and ignored it. A month later they broke up and the guy dated her best friend. I still helped her throughout the breakup. I hated how some random dude could get with her, then proceed to date her best friend, when I’d been my best to her, staying loyal being in a very close relationship with her and her family, and I get this? She told me afterwards she didnt think she hurt anyone when she was with him which completely baffled me. How could a person be so ignorant seeing how much pain their friend could go through. I still liked her, through all my pain and tears and treated her the best I could. She always tells me how she is thankful she has me, and that I am like no one else she’s met, and that I mean so much to her. She’s said shes told me things she’s never told anyone else and that Ive always been with her through her hardest times. But she still hangs out with other people that treat her like shit, and does not seem to care much about me. 

She is young and allowed to make mistakes, how entitled can one person be? It seems she's made it clear she isn't interested in a romance with you and wants you as a friend, emotionally blackmailing her is not the route to take, again you're acting like she owes you something because you've been 'nice'.

>I feel like everything she tells me is BS and I am being used. I’ve had so much pain over these years, worst pains of my life. Yet I still like her?? I always wish I never met her and that my feelings for her would end, but my feelings wont go away no matter how hard I’ve tried. Its like a curse that tortures me every single day I see her. Am I the asshole for not letting go of her?

You are a total 'nice guy' I don't think there's anything else to say. YTA, she doesn't owe you anything and it seems she made it clear from day one she wasn't interested in you romantically, but because you've been a friend to her and 'nice' you think she owes you something, she doesn't, either sort your head out and be a friend to her or take a step back, you have a toxic way of thinking."

b6uz7s,"NAH.

You're not a bad person for having trouble expressing your feelings.

Mind you:

For a whole bunch of reasons it would probably be good to work on being able to show/express your feelings with someone who loves you and is okay with you being awkward about it. She'll probably appreciate the effort, and you'll be prepared for dealing with other people in the future who are less accustomed to you.

Even if you stumble over it, just: ""You are a really good friend and I appreciate you. I think you're great and I want you to know that your friendship means the world to me,"" *no matter how awkwardly you say it*, that still is meaningful.

Plan it in advance.

Hell, show her this post and say: ""I wrote this.""

Expressing your feelings is hard but it gets easier with practice.

And I can tell you, as someone who's been on the receiving end of the awkward, stumbling declaration of sincere platonic affection?

I hold that to my heart, because it really, truly does mean a lot to me. It means so much because it's *not* easy, but to know that someone I love loves me back, and loves me enough to want to tell me *even though that's so clearly hard for them*?

So, so precious."

As long as you give them proper warning (two weeks) and leave amicably, you should be able to keep the relationship."
b6vq6n,"It sounds more like her friends are the asshole here.

I don't think you should ask her to not tell her friends. But she should get new friends. Fighting is normal, and it's important to be able to talk to a friend about these things to gain different perspectives, validate your own feelings, vent etc etc - of course you don't need to share intimate details about it, but it's important for a lot of people to be able to seek advice outside of a relationship. And I think that's perfectly healthy. "
b6vwx9,"NTA - If you hate your name this much, you will be a legal adult and can change it if you so desire. IMO it's shitty of your parents to say this will hurt your relationship, it's just a name. "
b6w86j,"NAH you clearly understand the industry far better than your friend does, and so it's clear from your post that you're genuinely giving her good advice.
At the same time though you can imagine that you it would be incredibly disheartening for her to here that from you.
I would suggest helping her as much as you can (and as you want lol) and letting her find out the harsh truths of the industry by herself.

And who knows, Harry Potter isn't particularly well written :P"
b6wcxv,NTA Kids should learn these things and they shouldn't think it's something they should be rewarded for doing.

b6wsm5,"NTA. I feel like your title is inaccurate. I don't feel like you told her ""no"" for rejection, but how she presented said rejection. She used you as a tool to get what she wants, but treated you like you were nothing. I'm glad you moved on. "

I doubt it. Spamming goes away when you either block or ignore it. Two wrongs don't make a right. "

These friends aren't your friends then. As hard as it can be to feel like you're alone you need to branch out and make new friends and leave these people in the toxic dust your ex generates. "
b6x1zk,"NTA. A major part of kink is making sure any one involved in the scene is consenting. You're not consenting to her scene and she is dragging you into it. Also using kink as an avenue to deal with mental health issues is a dangerous, unsafe way to handle mental health. It does more damage to allow her to use her mental health status as a shield for her behavior than it is to stop her from acting this way outside of a consenting group."
b6x21h,NTA. Sounds like a very toxic relationship. She seemed to not care about you as much as she cared about getting sympathy from you. The fact that she turned every conversation into one about her makes that very true. You’re not in the wrong here OP however I wouldn’t make it a habit to lie to women. Women get spiteful when they find out you lied

When you pay for food in a restaurant you are paying, in part, for the location and the clean-up.

You are making him do something that he does't want to do because it is for his benefit, and he is not mature enough to self-motivate.  That is parenting.  He will probably be happy for it someday.

b70hn5,"NTA in my opinion. It's a big deal, even if it is ""just a big party"" and he should know that since he's had a wedding already. I don't know if it's entirely worth ruining a friendship over, but I'd be pretty upset about it, and definitely write that friend off for a while at least. I was in the military for a while, and you really learn who your real friends are when you take time off to come home, and, even with weeks, or even months to prepare, friends can't make 30 min. trips to see you. It's not exactly the same thing, but it really makes you realize who real friends are. You were willing to take a huge chunk of time off, and make huge commitments for a destination wedding, meanwhile he can't even ask his boss twice for a much smaller time commitment. Seems pretty cut and dry to me.

You're just overthinking it. The day care is a long ways away and even if it was right next door there are no ethical problems with smoking a joint while kids are within earshot. It's not like you're hot boxing with a toddler or something. This is 100% fine, and social stigma against cannabis is what's driving your anxiety on this. "
b70mz0,"YTA. YTA. YTA. 

You crossed so many lines here it’s ridiculous. Do you have feelings for this “friend”, because this seems like the kind of thing only some obsessively jealous asshole would do. "
b70s63,"YTA.

I don't know your whole family story, but based on what you've told us your mother is having an incredibly difficult time going through an emotionally devastating series of events and your reaction to finding out she's struggling is to yell at her? Why not offer to help if you care so much? She's an abuse victim who is not in a good place right now. What you did helps no one and there was no reason to be that mean."
b70t1g,NTA. Moving is a big ask. 
b70t48,"NTA.  My wife and I have two Norwegian Elkhounds.  One male and female.  Not for breeding, both fixed.  Our male is the sweetest dog there is and will lick you to death before he bites you.  The female OTOH has a LOT of what the trainer called ""fear aggression"".  She's great with dogs smaller than her but ones her size and bigger, she's aggressive towards.   They told us that, in her mind, she's the baddest bitch out there and needs to let other dogs know she's the baddest and to not to  F\*#K with her.  So when we take them out somewhere, we're VERY mindful about people, kids, and other dogs.    


One time we were out and I was watching the dogs while my wife went to do something.  This kid comes over and wants to pet them.  I point to the male and tell him that it's OK to pet that one but to stay away from this one.  I had the female pulled close.  Well, this kid wants to play with her, grabs a stick, and starts toward us.  I tell him to not do that be he keeps walking towards us.  I have my hand out telling him to not tease my dog!  Well, kid's dad comes over and literally slaps him hard upside the head.  Yells at him to listens to what I'm saying or he's gonna get bit!    


So no, you're certainly NTA.

b71bsf,NTA Don’t listen to them. Be yourself and if they can’t accept it then they aren’t your friends
b71du1,"NTA, but I would have asked just to get his twisted response. Also instead of repeating yourself you should have just said ""My apologies sir, that's the best offer I have. If you still want to go with the G6 I'd be happy to cash you out"""

""Yeah, it is nice. That's why I didn't have kids."""
b71o9a,"NTA what the fuck is wrong with your husband? Understanding emotional changes during pregnancy means you understand that a pregnant lady probably didnt mean it when she blew up over a dish in the sink, it doesnt mean you treat your wife like shes crazy. It's like a well known golden rule that when a pregnant lady says she wants food, you get her food. I'm blown away, I'm surprised being sarcastic is all you've done"
b71sgv,"YTA, it sounds like you way overwhelmed this poor girl. Getting all that stuff out of the blue must have been stressful and embarrassing for her. You’re not her doctor or therapist and you’re not a professional, you don’t know what is best for her.

I'd report them and find a better dentist. If you're in that much pain, you should be taken seriously and not just ushered out the door. I would call around other places and see if they have any sort of payment plans and if they can get you in asap. Tooth pain is no joke. "
b72djy,"YTA, if you two decided you weren’t even going to be there why tell her at all? Now you probably ruined the party and made the house uncomfortable.

You didn't have to make him anything. If he truly was barraging you he absolutely overreacted. If he wanted a different kind of egg that's fine, but he should have just asked you nicely and see if you'd make him one.

""it's just an egg and that I need to get over it""

Have him follow his own advice here

edit: info - How bad did he actually react here. I'm having trouble gleaning that from your post. Was he yelling or raising his voice? Or was he just explaining why he didn't like runny yolks?"
b72isy,"NTA, also this might just be the wrong sub for this in general. How many times do people have to complain about how loud you are before you decide to post a note about it? In none of those times did this person stop consider, ""Maybe I *am* a problem...""

lol wtf

His views on women should be enough to be justified in wanting to keep your kids from him honestly.

People who don't sew can be SO fucking entitled, but it's a situation where you're damned if you do, damned if you don't.

They have a specific idea of exactly what they want the finished product to look like, but also want to make a thousand little changes.  

If you make the changes, the finished product isn't what they wanted and they complain about how you aren't very good at sewing.

If you don't make the changes, the finished product looks like what they wanted but they think it would have been better with the changes, so they complain about how you're not very good at sewing.

Fuck no. 

No way.

Sew something for a man and you'll always be expected to sew something else in the future, even if they criticize you and make your life hell for it.

Teach a man to sew and he'll never ask you to sew anything again because it's a fucking chore.

Edit - I'm totally ticked off on your behalf, OP, because I know how absolutely SHITTY it is when you do something for a hobby and an entitled twat of a family member starts making unreasonable demands and then shades you for politely saying no.

Other types of shady assholery related to sewing;

 - wants it made with super fucking expensive fabric, but expects YOU to pay for it.
 
 - wants a special one-of-a-kind titanium exposed zipper but expects YOU to order it and pay for it, but doesn't know where they come from, only that they think that's what it's called and they saw it on a dress in a store but they don't remember which one
 
 - wants you to stop sewing your wedding dress so you can make a bunch of costumes for a kids party.  When repeatedly told no, it can't happen, it won't happen, they ignore you and the day of the party they text you saying ""I'll be there in 30 minutes to pick up those costumes"" and then you have to post copies of the transcripts to facebook because she's whipping up a mob of angry villagers to come burn down your house.

 - Expects that you know what she means when she says ""I want the sleeves to be like a waterfall but not like... dangly or droopy, just flowy"" then gets mad when you ask her to find pictures of the sleeve she wants but no pictures exist and she can't draw so you're left to figure it out on your own, and after hours and hours, it's wrong and she won't wear it."
b732hp,"NTA.

b7344i,"NTA. Your boyfriend sounds controlling. Tagging along to fuck around on his phone or switch isn't for his enjoyment, it's to keep tabs. "
b737ss,"NTA

Anyone who drives drunk is a fucking asshole. Grief sucks but drunk driving is a choice.  A shitty choice."
b73cyo,"YTA. Those are sensitive pictures and if they got out could have some serious repercussions for her. Why do you need them now that you’ve broken up? If you are getting continued “enjoyment” out of them there are plenty of places to find that type of enjoyment that would be consensual. 

It’s not illegal for you to keep them, sure. But yeah you’re an ass hole for not respecting her wishes. "

b73wt7,"NTA. I'm not going to argue politeness or expectations, because the reality is if I was doing what you were doing and some randos approached me the same way, I not only would have ignored them, but probably would have told them to leave me alone and gotten angry.

You do sound a bit humblebrag, though. I don't care about Kafka or your Pokemon level, and those were unnecessary details.

b73y6u,"NTA at all.  

1. Why should you have to do the cooking when your parents go out.  Are your brothers' arms and legs painted on that they can't manage to cook occasionally? Or put the pan in to soak /clean when they've finished? 

2. Your mother is an overgrown teenager. For goodness sake,  to get so shitty about a pan being left out once!  If you did it every time you cook,  or left the kitchen in a huge mess and went to bed leaving it like that,  fair enough.  She needs to get over herself. 

Go on strike.  No more cooking for anyone except for yourself. If your others are hungry, they can cook. Let your mother know that on their nights out you will no longer be cooking.  Either she will have to prepare something that the boys can have for dinner or make sure there is food for them to cook.  Not your problem. "
b73zdb,Either NAH or SHP
b7409z,"NAH. The little girl is 14 and got jealous her older sister is doing something cool. Maybe she wouldn't really enjoy it, but as a 14 year old person with an older sibling that doesn't matter - she's not being rational, but no one should expect that from someone at that age.

The father probably has a lot of stuff to deal with considering the family is quite big, acted without seeing all sides of the story. I think he's wrong, but he's far from being an asshole because of that  

OP isn't an asshole. He's right about inviting just one of his sisters, even though the other one disliked it. Just go and try to explain your reasoning, or let things fade out. I'm sure this won't be family breaking. "
b74443,NTA sounds like he has a stick up his butt

b74e62,"NTA.  Honestly, offering to pay for her getting home is already above and beyond."
b74fcs,"This is tough.. I feel that she needs professional help more than anything. 

I'm going to go with NAH.

My reasoning being that ultimately, this is the sort of situation that only a professional knows how to deal with. And it seems more like you told her to stop making a scene, more so than you told her to stop mentioning depression. 

She's desperately reaching out, but this is not something that a person naturally knows how to handle. "

REDDEST OF FLAGS esp if:

Let me know if he’s still in the mood to clean.  I’ll send him my address.  "
b75iws,"YTA but only because you basically judged a book by its cover. You should have observed them as individuals instead of a group. But I fully understand as a male, you probably deal with shit like that all the time and I’m sure it’s exhausting. And his dignity is fine.... probably "
b75jqs,"YTA, because you ""barged into the bathroom to show him."" Couldn't you have waited to discuss it with him, you know, when he wasn't in the bathroom? I get that you want to help him cut out sugar, but don't force it. "
b75ks7," NAH, I can understand your reasoning, but it would be extremely suspicious. Silicon bands are totally fine. "
b75m1t,"YTA because of the way you reacted. Although you were disappointed by what your wife *didn't*  do, you're the asshole for what you *did* do - and that is throw a childish fit by ""letting her have it."" "
b75nke,"YTA. It's an Applebee's, not a Bible study. If you're so worried about what your son overhears, maybe don't take him to a restaurant that has a full bar."
b75nyb,"NTA, I'm assuming asking to be put off of speakerphone was for confidentiality reasons since you're exchanging personal info. Your dad just berated a bank worker over the phone which wasn't cool, regardless if she was being rude (which doesn't seem like it, but the way she asked about the drivers license was a bit rude- not everyone has one, including myself at the moment, it's not so crazy). You don't just stoop down and yell at someone like that, and you actually tried to stop it- so you're not an asshole. 

I don't think you're a doormat, just polite. And the fact you pointed out you hate phone calls, it just seemed like you wanted to get the call over and done with without unnecessary conflicts. "
b75rxo,"i mean, you didnt purposefully get the car towed. you didnt ask anyone to tow the car, probably just school policy. 

"
b75sci,Well it’s more complicated than “who’s the asshole”.  If it was that simple it would have been sorted out 800 years ago. But it sounds like your parents were right that you put yourself in a pretty dangerous situation. 
b75wek,"NTA 

The children choose the grandma names typically. And great grandmas dont get first dibs usually. Especially when they already have an established grandma name.

b75wgk,YTA because this sounds like a (futile) attempt to control her.    
b75x8w,"NTA - sounds like you are independent and doing a great job contributing and handling money responsibly.   

I'd really caution against lending your parents money.  I think your Mom is an asshole for borrowing money from her teenage daughter and for getting pouty when she doesn't get nuggets, too.   "
b761tn,"NTA you COULD have moved to a tupperware container but since they clearly don't consider your needs why should you consider theirs? SOLUTION: Since he said it's his food and you shouldn't have thrown it out, get one of his dirty spoons, dig out his macaroni and put it, without a bowl, in his room on his bed. Take a photo text it to him and write ""fixed it"""
b762ou,"NTA, there is no unwritten law that says bestie sisters have to live together. Also she's an actual adult, she should get over it. 

You're not responsible for her social life or her happiness. 

>and we both see a future with each other. 

>although I've known D for 7 months, and have been dating for 4,

I'm gonna be blunt. You're 16, your discussion of your relationship is a very obvious teenage mentality (enjoy that mentality while it lasts, I mean that honestly). There likely isn't a long-term future for this relationship, especially after high school ends. And that is ok. You will very likely date other people in the future. Just don't poison the well with your sister over this guy, even if she is being harsh/a downer right now. She probably just feels lonely and a little adrift because you're paying more attention to this guy than to her. "
b763gu,"NTA. It's your life, live where you want, you can't live based on their preferences. Just make a plan to line up a job in advance of graduating if you can. "

b769o5,">she would say ""fine, donate it, I just didn't have time to sort it.""

>but eventually she's going to start asking about these clothes, if I liked an item, so on and so forth.

If she says ""fine donate them"" and then you do, she has no room to be pissy, and definitely tell her that

Also NTA, you shouldn't feel obligated to be her clothing dumping ground, but maybe she uses this as the excuse/rationale to see you? Just seems weird. 
"
b76av5,"You know, I understand the dilemma with balancing life commitments and supporting someone's grief.  Here's the thing, twice you say this:

> a friend that my girlfriend hasn't talked to in three years passed away

It doesn't matter how long it has been.  Grief is complicated and transcends proximity from last visit.  For that reason I think YTA here.  On some level you don't really get it or accept her grief. "

Y'all really need to read *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dale Carnegie.

It's really not hard to tweak the sentences both of you use into *much* less aggressive ones, and it'll solve all these problems."
b76hfg,"NTA. This friendship has basically run its course and that's fine, it happens. 

>For example, at my wedding she had to come stag because her husband could not afford to fly in along with her, and she was pretty upset at the idea of 'being alone' during the reception. So, after the dinner at my reception was over she invited some man I've never met to my wedding to hang out with him as her date (she was in an open marriage). That is just one example.

Not sure what you need to forgive her re this though. If she's in an open marriage why does/did it matter to you?"
b76ioe,"NTA.  

* You don't have to contact anybody who makes you feel uncomfortable.  
* You don't owe anybody your time.    
* Your family are the assholes here, not only for making a drive-by diagnosis of this man, but mainly for not trusting your instincts.  Also, for trying to guilt you into a relationship with someone you aren't interested in.  

I try to be honest with guys when I'm not interested.  However, sometimes it takes dishonest methods to ensure your safety and privacy.   Giving out your number in this circumstance would have guaranteed unwanted contact.   You made the right choice. 

(Edit: thank you for the silver :)!  So shiny!)"
b76kck,"YTA, but barely. Probably more nah honestly, but you knew that your bf was into it and you said it anyway. Maybe you just weren't thinking about it and were just having casual conversation, but you could have had a little more tact. 

It doesn't seem like a huge deal though, if you just say sorry and that you didn't mean to hurt his feelings it will probably be fine. "
b76l88,NAH There are no thought police. Just be supportive and give your brother all the love in the world right now. 
b76meb,"NTA, you’re uncomfortable for a reason. Trust your gut. "
b76nh9,NTA. I would move out of that place when you can. It's a huge red flag to me that management would tell you to keep talking to these people yourself rather than intervening. 
b76pqx,"NAH, She's not entitled to stay at your house. She's not an asshole for asking, but if she wants a guaranteed place she can go to a hotel. The reason why you don't want her to stay does not matter in the slightest

&#x200B;"
b76vgg,"YTA.

To clarify,  her parents don't have a lot of money, and yet:

> As a graduation gift, my girlfriend's parents are planning on giving her (us) up to $1,000 to spend on a bedroom furniture set for our apartment.

They clearly have prioritized helping the two of you.  They are giving you a very generous and practical gift to support the two of you setting up your lives together.   This is a monumental expression of love and support. 

**Where is your sense of gratitude?   How arrogant, bratty and ungrateful of you to take this act of love and use it as an opportunity to criticize your gf's family.**

YTA.  "
b76x88,Am I drunk or is reddit suddenly Spanish? 
b76z0x,"And I don't care if it's a drink or two but it never has been is the problem :/ it's always they finish a bottle together and depending on what they were drinking it's either ""okay you're drunk but you just need some water and food"" or ""well you've thrown up multiple times and are now passed out and I can't get a response properly out of you to make sure you're okay"" "
b76zi8,"NTA. If you’re footing the bill, you have every right to go to school where you want to. "
b771uf,"Yta. This isn’t your place. If your aunt chose not to go, that’s her business. You admittedly don’t know the ins and outs of her relationship with her mother so you have no right to comment on it. Leave it alone. "
b771wi,Do it. 
b772p3,Why doesn’t she just shave and spare you both? 
b777be,"NTA. Your title implies that she had served you. In reality, it appears that at no point did “service” actually occur. I don’t count the speechless water top offs as actually beginning the patron/waitress relationship. "
b77ah4,"YTA - kind of.  Have you heard of selection bias?  It’s this idea that members of a particular group aren’t representative of the population as a whole.  For example, if you wanted to see how religious Americans were, but only asked people who were coming out of church - that’s selection bias.  Obviously people who attend church are not going to mirror American society as a whole.

Isn’t it possible that the kind of people that are attracted to Reddit are the kind of people that are susceptible to (or already have) depression?  For someone who has a hard time interacting with real people (which many people with depression / anxiety deal with) Reddit can give them that sense of community and personal interaction that they lack.

As for internet points?  Who cares?  You’re going to do more damage by questioning a Redditor who actually does have  a mental illness, then you will by believing a Redditor who’s lying.

I’ve been hospitalized for attempted suicide several times.  The fact that someone thinks I might use my pain for goddam *internet points* is incredibly insulting.  Trust me - I wish I were a troll.  I wish I were just pretending and that my life weren’t a steaming pile of garbage.  But I’m not.  So it would be nice if people took me at my word.  What’s the worst that could happen?  That a mentally healthy person would get a bit more karma?

Honestly, I couldn’t care less.  "
b77au0,"YTA - If you want to have a guy over, do it somewhere where you won't bother someone else. That's very selfish. Unless you have left for her to have a guy over before or you have some type of running agreement, there's no reason she should feel obligated to leave just so you can have a sleepover. That's her home. What is she supposed to do sit in the hall?"
b77b6b,"NTA

can't help something like that tbh"
b77bu1,"ESH. You definitely started it, its none of your business how much or little she eats. Some people lose their appetite after physical activity. I do. If we backpack for three days, my husband wants to eat all the things whereas I need two days to normalize. I tried his way and I toss my cookies within a hour of eating, sometimes before dessert. 😕 

She escalated with the unsolicited comments about consumption which were thinly veiled and insulting. You didn't need to pull out the finishing blow, commenting about her body. You're definitely more of the asshole but maybe you should both mind your own plates."
b77dng,"NTA

You don't need to like toxic people.  Good luck."
b77dyy,"NTA.   

You already had said

>I told her that she can expect that I’ll never recommend her anywhere else ever again if I didn’t get an apology for this one.

And now you are following through on that statement.  Sounds like she is testing your boundaries.  She's about to learn that you have strong character and strong boundaries. 

* Your friend is an asshole
* Your family are assholes for considering you to be the lone thing standing in her way of a career at Publix.  Why don't they be references for her?

Heads up that she'll probably put you as a reference against your will.  Be sure to let her know now that you are happy to give her an *honest* reference... but unfortunately that will not be a positive one based on her past behaviour."
b77e1j,NTA but also INFO: So she lied to family about her being able to take him home?
b77fsa,"NAH, just tell her what happened and what you did. It's kind of a cute story, it shows you care for her and don't want to let her down."
b77gfu,"NTA. Sometimes toxic people need to be cut from our lives. Your mother is definitely toxic if she left you after a major surgery like that, especially after she said she would take care of you. "
b77lhe,"NAH. Sounds like you followed leave policies. Good plan going to your mutual manager to create a record. make sure you follow up with an email to get it in writing. 

Doesn't sound like S was being malicious though, just derpy. "
b77lyu,"ESH

you blocked him **before/during** your anxiety attack. if he said ""this is why [you] have no friends and [you're] a piece of worthless shit"" **verbatim** then he's also the asshole because of the verbal abuse and causing the anxiety attack.

he didn't give you the middle finger when you needed a hand, he pushed you down and walked away. you didn't even ask for help. you didn't say anything about the anxiety attack. how can he help if you block him?

you're the asshole here because you just explained the whole situation into text and still didn't get the stuff i had to spell out here."
b77oyb,NTA- there's a time and place for everything. This is time for you to pick your special dress. Then you can focus of the bridesmaids. I wouldn't do it together. 
b77s53,"NTA. I can’t even wrap my head around your husband’s point of view here. Like seriously his morals are fucked up, not yours."
b77za6,"[Edit] ps NTA

Are lost friend? I'd suggest r/relationships r/relationship_advice r/getmotivated r/study

Sounds like your mother has boundary issues and you need to defend yours pretty strongly. "
b780hm,"NTA! I used to do my african american friends hair and style and curl it but it was bc she got too tired doing it. just while y’all are chilling one day ask if you guys can have a spa night. you’ll style her hair, get some wine and just relax "
b785xv,"Don't hide it from your husband. Just tell him, unless he's the type to go over there and assault someone. Also I really hope it never gets worse if your dealer/friend was in an even worse state. I know it's evident that this is a unique scenario but seriously...he grabbed your ass, he groped you. I like to think I'm not associated with any person that would do that even in that state of mind. I just don't understand the inclination unless he's a dude with some scary stuff buried down deep. 

I hope I don't get raked over the coals for this but if this isn't a good case for legalization I don't know what is. "
b789n1,NTA If you are allergic staying there shouldn't even be an option after it made you sick the first time 
b78g2e,This is the wrong sub for this. Maybe move to relationships or an ED sub to get advice. People on this sub can be harsh and you deserve kind words and advice from people who understand eating disorders. 
b78w1z,"NTA- My admiration for your actions to interfere with the rude intentions of multiple individuals during the event of which those same individuals had impeded your view of the entertainment cannot be expressed verbally.

Edit: In other words, nice job being an asshole to the actual assholes. But you’re not the bad asshole "
b78wuq,NTA you are old enough to have a say in your own living arrangements.  It sounds like your mother’s place is not a healthy environment.
b78x7f,"NTA. When you’re taking less money than the going rate but being forced into taking longer shifts, that’s not ok. You asked for the shift pattern to be moved around - again, in a job that is helping *them* out where you could arguably get more money elsewhere - and they said no. You’re totally within your rights here. "
b7995e,"NTA-

Honestly I don’t think you should’ve even apologized.

He messed up and made you look bad. How would you have asked him about something you didn’t even know about? 

As for exposing him in front of your superiors, him not stepping up and saying “that was my fault” was throwing you under the bus. They were fine with letting you take the fall for their mistake, and I 100% think you were smart to speak up and say you weren’t even aware and that wasn’t your fault. "
b79nk5,"Wow.  Maybe a gal your age might learn you a thing or two, if you can stow your fragile ego."
b79osf,"NTA, but you kinda missed a vital step in the moving away from controlling parents thing."
b79qo1,"YTA-

You didn’t give a ton of detail, so I’m gonna make some assumptions to fill in the blanks. 

People who boast about “just being blunt” are the ones who are actually rude and inconsiderate, and who try to give it a nice bow to come off as “just a character trait” which is bullshit.

The reason why after a year she’s just starting to constantly tell you this is because she’s probably been worn down by your “blunt” behavior and is exhausted by it.

In your example, you basically are refusing to compromise about the art, which is shitty. The fact that you emphasized the $10 makes me immediately think you don’t respect her art or think it’s as good as yours. That is rude, and I could see how your statement made her realize all this, and that you would never compromise just as you probably haven’t over the past year.

Being blunt is not an excuse for being rude and refusing to compromise or hold your tongue sometimes. "
b79qr7,NTA having anxiety does not make you be a bitch. I have suffered severe life crippling anxiety and I am not nasty and snarky to people. How on earth does being a bitch help anxiety? No this girl was mean and out of line. 
b7a1b1,[deleted]
b7adun,NTA -  it sucks when you feel like you can’t share bc she will repeat what you tell her.  
b7alpm,"NTA.

Dudes just pissed because he tried scamming you.

He obviously didn’t own the calculator yet and was likely buying it from a third party for cheaper than he was selling it to you.

If he actually tried spreading shit, people would likely just laugh at him.  Probably what I’d do if some dude got all pissy about someone not buying his calculator lmao"
b7aqeq,"NAH, the convo moved naturally toward sexy topics, it's not like she sent her number and your first text was an unsolicited dick pic, and your response to her question wasn't disrespectful or anything

Ghosting, or even just not texting anymore for a bit - it happens, don't read into it or take it personally. "
b7arzf,"YTA

All you had to do was say that you had a nice time, but you didn't think you were compatible. There was zero need for you to make comments about your thoughts on her body."
b7ass3,"YTA. Publicly declaring the food bad was unnecessary - just suck it up and eat it, it's polite. If you really are committed to not eating it, lie and say you're not feeling well, then, if you have to, speak to her in private about it. "
b7avfx,NTA You didn't know anything was wrong. If you're classmate hadn't been a dumbass they wouldn't have gotten in trouble. I'm just glad you didn't get suspended too. 
b7axde,"ESH

You're an asshole for doing this out of vindictiveness, and if she has a life estate, this is illegal AF since she is essentially a legal owner of the house for the remainder of her life, you cannot just sell the house out from under her (I am a lawyer, but I am not your lawyer). Talk to a lawyer, enjoy your likely lawsuit if you go through with this, you deserve it. 

She's an asshole because she is and was acting like a giant asshole unnecessarily, no doubt about it. But consider this, _her husband died less than two months ago,_ she's likely still intensely grieving so it wouldn't be surprising if she was acting irrationally or extremely and in a bad emotional place. Did you not consider this context?"
b7ayj1,"NTA, and it's neither unprofessional nor unethical. 

It was dumb to tell anyone though especially if Sarah asked that you not. Your coworker will probably tell Pete. Learn to keep your mouth shut at work. "
b7b2sx,"NAH it sounds like the kid is (not unreasonably) kind of latching on to a stable home life in the form of his friend's (you) family, which is to be expected if his own home life really sucks and is unstable

Obviously set firm boundaries with your son and obviously make it clear that smoking is unacceptable and won't be tolerated no matter what his friends are doing, and that this guy can't stay over near as much. But, like, I have compassion for this kid and from your post at least it doesn't sound like he's only using your son for the perks of this friendship, and your son probably knows what's going on with him and wants to help out his less-advantaged friend. So just keep in mind that your son is probably just trying to be a good and supportive friend. "
b7b3rt,"ESH. 

She should have brought this up sooner than two weeks ago; you threatening divorce as a communication tactic/to manipulate her is a complete asshole move at the same time. 

Find a marriage counselor to discuss this issue with, you are in no way communicating effectively. "
b7b3s7,"NTA.

Your mom sounds like she has some attachment issues towards you she needs to work towards. You’re an adult, going to university and being out and about are natural steps that you should be taking. I think she’s putting unnecessary pressure on you- you’re not responsible for her feelings. "
b7b5ey,"NAH. You want to stand by your grandfather. She will understandably miss you in hers and your child's life. I completely understand your motivations, but you have no idea how long you will be gone. And I assume you will not be working in that time. I understand both sides..."
b7b8eo,"NTA.

Kid, it ain't your problem to solve. You can offer help, you can offer guidance, but you aren't obligated to solve all the problems of your friends.

I would suggest an intervention made by the rest of your group for the two of them. That way, they'll know what and where they went wrong. "
b7b9t3,NTA.  She’s a pos for neglecting her cat like that. 
b7bcng,"NAH.

From my own personal experience, my boyfriends brother and sister were completely cool and happy that we all were going to spend “siblings weekend” together and everything was great. Maybe your bro just wants you to bond w his gf.

You’re not an asshole for wanting some of that alone time, though. He’s family and the way you feel is completely understandable. I think you should just lightly mention that you had been looking forward to bro/sis time, and if that doesn’t work out, I’m sure it will be fine to hang out w the both of them in order to see your brother."
b7blaf,YTA. If she isn't welcome in your house be a grown up and tell her. 
b7bmt9,SHP. Sell your phone for a new cow.
b7bn2w,[deleted]
b7bnpv,ESH.  Everybody is treating everybody badly here and you should all apologize.  You definitely shouldn't live together.  
b7brd3,YTA. Your girlfriend deserves to know. 
b7bs6e,"NTA.

It's nice that you have helped around the house historically, but they can't assume that you're going to continue to do manual labor for free, for your girlfriend's mom. It's ridiculous that she's upset by this, too. 

Talk to your girlfriend. She needs to understand that she can't volunteer you for huge tasks like that without talking to you, and SHE should be the one to clean up the mess with her mother, not you. "
b7bzda,NTA. I don't find baseball exactly entertaining either. So I understand where you're coming from. You're  in an unfortunate circumstance because you're at the mercy of your parents and they want you to go to the game to support your brother. I don't think there's anything you can do about it. Make the best of it. 
b7c10i,"ESH. V shouldn't be cheating, but I also think stealing and destroying the work she submitted was crappy. Is there any reason you couldn't tell a teacher and get them to sort it out? You would definitely be the A if you allow your other friend to take the blame for what you did."
b7c26d,"YTA. It’s time to start taking responsibility. It’s a hard time for everyone and by acting more standoffish and angry than everyone else you’re selfishly telegraphing that you don’t care about their feelings over your own. The fact that they are so caring and patient with the way they interact with you goes to show how much more mature and selfless they are. 

As a person it’s important to value other people’s emotions more than your own and it’s also important to not let anger fester. Anger isn’t good for you. You need to act with love and encouragement. Anger will only lead to regret. The lie you might be telling yourself is that authenticity of what you’re feeling is more important than being considerate to others. It’s not. But you can be authentic about your feelings while also making yourself the master of your emotions. Do not reject growth for the lie.

Also you’re not perfect and you probably do plenty of things that annoy them so don’t be harsh on them when they’re not harsh on you. 

That’s called doing unto others as you would have others do unto you. "
b7c2sf,"NAH.

He is doing something illegal and brags about it. That takes a particular mentality.

That said it is potentially a petty thing to do."
b7c5a6,"NTA, I enjoy going to the library. It's meant to be a quiet spot for people to study or read. You don't break that rule without making people upset."
b7c87p,NTA. Sounds like your wife wants to be a stay at home mom. But is doing a shitty job of communicating that. 
b7c8lf,"NAH. I’m sorry if she doesn’t feel the same way for you as you do her, btw. :(

1.) When you tell her your feelings I’m sure it only makes her uncomfortable and she seems unresponsive because she cannot reciprocate them. I would stick to keeping the feelings to yourself even though it may be hard.

2.) If you mention anything about last night, just simply say you’re sorry if you crossed any lines and that you had a lot to drink. Don’t act as if you don’t remember and don’t leave her to tell you more information about the events that took place. That would be false information, and I personally wouldn’t want to give off the idea that I drink and then don’t remember my actions."
b7c9ji,"NTA

>  her friend wasn’t feeling it and shouldn’t be forced to fake it. I mean she’s technically right, but *it doesn’t make it any less fucking rude*.

This exactly."
b7c9y1,"NTA, people should know better than to take jelly beans on april fools day"
b7ca0u,"NTA

Sounds like you're putting more into the relationship than she is."
b7caqu,"Gonna play devil's advocate: OP did say it became like a promise between them that she wouldn't smoke. She went and continued the relationship knowing her fiance frowns upon this behavior. If smoking weed is a priority, and if you know your SO won't like it, then either: dont do it, or lose the SO. Don't blame the SO for expecting OP to stick to her promise."
b7caz0,"YTA - I didn't really think so until you called the basic recognition of another gender ""radical feminism"", that's just ridiculous. Refer to people in a way they are comfortable, communication is not for you, it's for the group, and Jane is a part of this group. A lot of people are uncomfortable with the ""neutral"" use of guys and with good reason.

Here's some words to try: Team, folks, people, peeps, everyone, y'all, gang, squad, comrades, friends, I'm sure you're creative enough to come up with some more yourself."
b7cd51,NTA. It sounds like your MIL is taking advantage of you. I’m so sorry.  Leave as soon as you can! 
b7cdgc,"YTA.

>She wants to learn

Read that again.

She wants to learn.

Make sure your husband will respect if she doesn't want to continue later on, but FFS *she wants to learn*. Let her learn."
b7ckth,"NTA. Fuck his plans, if he’s gonna abuse you like that, he can face the consequences."
b7cm7g,"NAH 
I can't come down with a hammer on you, OP.
You acknowledge that you messed up, and you know how to work towards fixing it. That is good.

You're getting older so you won't be needing to report to your parents about everything. Your parents know this. They also know that you are responsible for your life and whatnot, but at the same time, they want to be there for you. It's fantastic you have parents who can help you and while you were dishonest, you know better.

Get your rear back into gear, you can do it! Take the help your parents offer and stay honest this time. Chin up, move forward."
b7cn91,"NTA, you told your ex the truth and she was hurt by that. The whole lying to her part when you were together is wrong obviously though."
b7cokn,"NTA

You asked your aunt, and she gave you her blessing. That's honestly really respectful of you. And quite frankly, it's your aunt's wedding. Not your mom's so her opinion doesnt matter. 

I would suggest sending a really nice gift and personal card to your aunt, maybe try to see her and go to lunch afterwards so you can still congratulate her. "
b7cshl,ESH. You for A) assuming flirtation on the basis of a single text and B) being willing to prioritize a new acquaintance over the feelings of your significant other. Your GF for A) not trusting you and B) assuming that men and women can't have platonic friendships.
b7csw1,"NTA Ummm why do you need to be there with your Ex In Laws? Can't your kids just go with their dad? Why does your Ex-FIL need you there? I'm so confused lol. That's the thing about divorces. Your Ex can let his parents pop in unexpectedly and run everyone's weekend, but not yours because you're not married anymore 😊. "
b7czzf,And you sound like an incel
b7d796,"YTA.

Ultimatums *are* a form of manipulation and thus you *did* cause her to do something she didn't want to do at a risk of losing something."
b7d7mg,[deleted]
b7d9ch,"SHP how the fuck is this even real, who writes this unironically? You sound like an evil stepmother caricature. "
b7da77,"NTA - I have autistic kids, I understand how fucked he would be to be abruptly placed in a strangers home. But the meth will physically harm him. And they can’t be good or even half-assed parents when methed up. Call CPS. This is a big big deal. It will ruin your friendship though. These things have a way of coming out even with the anonymous report. "
b7ddbv,NAH— you have no obligation to cover her shift. 
b7ddja,[deleted]
b7deiq,"NTA. But it seems like you've weighed the options. Personally, in a situation like this, I would let your father decide. Basically, if he ends up living, he can decide whether to tell his family, since they do live so far away. On the other hand, if he ends up passing, they will remember him with their cherished memories. 

It's a tough choice that little have experience with. I wish you and your family the best"
b7denn,"NAH. I think you were a bit harsh tho. From your explanation it doesn’t seem like there were any issues between y’all, but if they aren’t in your life, why invite them? It would be different if they were trying to be involved. Also, just because someone gives you life doesn’t mean you owe them something. "
b7dho6,"NTA

I thought this was going to be one of those posts where you would say you planned out a trip for just yourself to ""find yourself"" without telling your boyfriend until last minute. Nope, you were completely reasonable and you're doing this with your friends. His reaction was over the line.

He's also lying about planning out his Costa Rica trip, he's just trying to hurt you which is petty as shit. "
b7djcc,"NTA, It's your decision to quit or not, furthermore, it doesnt sound like the other members care that much about it either seeing as theyre always late and such"
b7dkfw,NTA. Dude obviously is suffering from insecurity issues.
b7dlcu,"NAH.

With great kindness, do you think you have allowed yourself enough time to grieve. A year is not that long. Nor is 2 years to an engagement after losing your wife.

Your reaction to the clothes suggests to me that you may not be ready to enter into another marriage just yet.  You had an overwhelming emotional reaction to this and I wonder if you reached out in grief for another person but really need more time.

It is worth considering at least. "
b7dm07,"NTA

&#x200B;

If you buy a broken lawn mower, but don't fully look it over knowing there's issues with it, that's on you not the person that sold it to you.  It would be nice of you to return some of the money, but you are obligated to or anything. I don't see how he can try and say you lied to him."
b7dnid,"NTA

You are clearly not the asshole for your roommate situation, but you are doing a self-validation thing here."
b7doiw,"YTA for ""flipping out"". She changed her mind, asked you, and you ""flipped out"". Just say no, dude. Just tell her you tried to set up something earlier and she didn't want to. Then reschedule to after the exam. It's not hard."
b7dorj,"NTA. It's your job, not your life. I'd suggest finding a new job before you quit, though."
b7dp0o,"ESH (but I'm leaning to YTA)

The reason why you should knock going into the basement is because it's basically his bedroom. The reason why he shouldn't have to knock coming upstairs is that it's the kitchen. It does not directly link to someone's room or anything like that. 

The fact that you either fail to or refuse to comprehend this shows you don't want to be reasonable, you don't even want him there.

And while I believe he should have asked you first, there's nothing sinister about a person crashing on a different bed. You already said the kids weren't there, stop trying to act like he's a pedofile or something.

This entire post reeks of resentment and aggression, so I honestly doubt you are being reasonable here. "
b7dpgd,"YTA

> ""I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary""

If your son is constantly causing disruptions to the point where the other kids in his class aren't able to obtain a proper education due to the constant disruptions, then yeah, it sounds like it is 100% necessary.

> ""I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing""

Repeated incidents of your son acting in a ""I'm going to do what I want, fuck you"" manner are NOT a 'little thing'.  

> ""My son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid""

And? Do the other kids in his classes not deserve to have an uninterrupted chance at an education - or should they suffer through it because hey, ""kids will be kids""?

"
b7dvis,All I'm going to say is I'm sure there were much better memories to tattoo as an in memoriam piece. It's pretty tactless to use his suicide note and method to remember him by. You chose his lowest moment of darkest depression to remember him. 
b7e188,"NTA - if it escalated into a shouting match, the other man and your husband are both in the wrong. You stepping in to support your husband would have escalated the situation even more. Your husband needs to learn how to walk away."

Just be respectful of her feelings, but there's nothing wrong with asking when you explain your feelings.  Just don't take no the wrong way.  You might be able to better facilitate a change if you can get a backup of that recording for her."
b7ec2e,"NTA. Assuming it's actually not moved in a month and it is in a precarious place, you're doing the right thing. "
b7edux,"NAH-

Is it possible you could compromise, and have a very small easy to plan ceremony for now, allowing his father to be there? And then you can plan your big wedding in a few years when you’re out of school and have more time? 

Just consider what you’d want done for you if you were in the fathers shoes. If he really wants to see his son get married, a compromise would probably be the best option. "
b7eee1,"YTA-

The fact that you’re holding your own biological child to a different standard than your stepdaughter is unfair. Even if she hasn’t warmed up to you as a father figure, that’s a role you decided to put yourself in by marrying her mother. You should want to help her because she’s your stepdaughter, and will be your stepdaughter for the rest of your life.  

Also, the fact that she doesn’t make her own income and you’re refusing to let her use your mutual funds to assist her daughter just because her daughter doesn’t see you as her father is another asshole move. At the very least you should be willing to do this for your wife’s sake. "
b7eg06,"YTA. 

She’s likes the shoes and they are loud. Don’t like it, suck it up. Or even better, maybe talk to her about it instead of gossiping. "
b7ejkf,"NTA - dude, your health comes first!! As much as you love and want to help your family, the military will not be fooled into accepting you either way and if they did, you could be risk-factor.

Please realize that your future does not just have one path - you can go into another direction, you can find your happiness and fullfillment some other way.

In the first place: take care of yourself. Nothing will get better if you just push yourself to lie for other people and ignore your own mental health. Please take care!"
b7ekye,"NTA. I think it’s pretty interesting that this is getting pretty much the opposite reaction as [this similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b781w3/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_wife_because_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) from today and I can’t help but wonder whether it’s a gender thing.

Personally, I would say NTA, I think it’s a bit delusional to think that physical attraction doesn’t matter even in a marriage. "
b7eouo,"NTA. You have the right to be referred to as your gender and you shouldn't have to compromise for others' comfort.

Just be prepared to get misgendered and hated on bit. Segments of the gaming community aren't so inclusive yet."
b7eso3,NTA - Tell your RA! Thats not okay. 
b7et8z,"NTA.  

Look, I don't know whether you objectively ""should"" tell her or not.  In your place, I might go either way.  But your conscience clearly has an opinion on the matter, and you'd do best to listen to it.  Your conscience, for all the inconvenient drama it might get you into, will not lead you to decisions that make you the asshole.  

Also, I'd really be giving your boyfriend the side-eye here if he's cool with his friend just blatantly cheating on his girlfriend, while he continues to hang out with them both like it's nbd.  People tend to make friends with people who think like they do.  "
b7eth3,"INFO: Are you sure that the junior isn't interested in you? Are you interested in her?  Either way, you probably shouldn't have said yes so soon if there was a possibility of another person to go with. 

Edit: YTA. I'm gonna say that in this situation you jumped the gun and going back on it would make you an asshole.    But at the end of the day you have to do what makes you happy and there's still 2 months left for her to find another date if you two are just going as friends."
b7euav,NTA. You’re each getting an equal service out of getting them so you pay an equal amount. Stand up for yourself.
b7ev4z,"NTA I think that people can opt out of social events whenever.  The only reason you'd be TA is if peoole were depending on you for a ride or food or something. 

Maybe next time you could skip the backgammon playing and show up late to see your friends and eat. Best of both worlds "
b7evga,"NTA - it's absolutely fine to be angry at your friend for still being so close with someone who hates you for such bullshit reasons.

However, you friend gets to decide who she wants to be friends with and if you aren't sensible about this, you could end up being the one being dropped. So I would suggest talking to your friend ... in an intimate setting that is just you two. Tell her you are incredibly sad over what her friend has said, that you don't understand why she hates you for such a reason, that there is nothing you can change and that if there was, that she should tell you. "
b7ewl4,NTA.  Report her and let the professionals handle it. 
b7ez2s,"NTA! Children need human interaction! I applaud you for being willing to step up and be willing to be uncomfortable to do what’s best for your son. Use this time to read with him, take walks outside, and play games. He will learn that having your one on one attention is so much more appealing and fun than you tube. Stick it out while he transitions through this time- it will be worth it! "
b7f0uw,NTA. Bad customer service considering their false advertisent. 
b7f30t,"NTA. I think if it nots working then it's not working. You have to find someone who you find fulfillment with and currently with your husband, that is clearly not happening.  Just show your kids that you still love them and that the divorce was nothing to do with them. Also don't talk down about your husband because kids don't respond well to that (not saying you will, I'm just stating that). You have to do what's best for you not your husband and family (excluding kids, do what's best for them always). "
b7f3ta,"NAH - but his current reasoning for wanting his daughter there, as a ""trial run"" or ""practice"" is just too cold for my tastes.  Your mother isn't even dead, yet he's prepared to use her service as training for his daughter?  His daughter should attend, but the reasoning could be so much simpler, and more pure.  She's family.  This will be a celebration of your mother's life, and all family that can attend should attend that celebration."
b7f6w4,"NTA, sounds like you’ve been paying rent for a while now. "
b7f7r1,"You aren’t an asshole for your opinion, but YTA for making things play out like that. You turned a harmless comment into several unneeded insults about somebody’s life, and made the lunch uncomfortable for them. "
b7f8vi,"I'm not 100% sure i understood all of that, but yeah, YTA and a moron. 

You're TA because you booty called a girl who you KNEW had unrequited feelings for you. You clearly took advantage of her. Don't get me wrong, shes an asshole too for lying about something as serious as sexual assault, but that's not the focus of your post. 

You're a moron because you actually slept with a woman who already falsely accused you of sexually assaulting her! She had nothing to work with before, but still managed to poison a friend group against you. Think she'll just do nothing now that you actually did fuck her and use her?"
b7fa9a,"NAH. In my view your parents might just still see you as a kid living back home, rather than 3 adults sharing a house.
However, you have spoken to dad and he hasn't changed which is a bit annoying but fairly minor.

Keep your car keys on you if it bothers you that much and suck it up to achieve your goals. "
b7famk,"INFO: how olds the kid? 

Edit: NTA. You're bf overreacted most likely. At 7 I really don't think this is a big deal. "
b7fb7t,"NTA keep the controller, lose the “friend”."
b7fbqs,"NTA.

You are stupid for leave airpods in the sleeve though."
b7fcog,"SHP 

If not then ESH 

You should be honest that you just don't feel like playing. However, this seems to be about more than just minecraft. It seems like an unhealthy relationship all around. "
b7fcty,NTA.  Ban him from the house.  Maybe you will be able to chat with her alone and help her to leave her abuser.
b7fd5k,NTA- You both agreed on a price and he tried to change that for his mistake. I wouldn't count on getting that card anytime soon. 
b7ffo5,"NAH. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it. Plus, less than a day's notice is not enough time to plan."
b7fgn1,NTA. You gave him fair warning not to claim you so there's nothing more you can do. He should have listened. 
b7fgzf,"NTA-

Forcing eviction seems like the best option, as long as she’s fully aware you’re doing it and not going to be blindsided. If your landlord is willing to let you break the lease and she’s refusing, then you have no obligation to continue to pay. That’s on her, she decided to stay and should have to take over the lease fully and then figure out the finances on her own. "
b7fkn3,"NTA - but I would be straight up with him. It will probably get worse if you dont. Plus most guys are pretty oblivious to ""hints"" so it's better to be forward."
b7fn21,"ESH.  This brings me back to the fond memories of my childhood vacations lol. I think you were both in the wrong. He shouldn't have gotten mad at you and constantly insulted you and blamed you for ruining the trip. However you probably shouldn't have said whatever you did that you ""won't go into details"" about.  "
b7for6,NAH. Talk to him yourself and just explain it’s not cool to take your shit and how you know your mother to be if he gets caught with it. 
b7fozm,"NTA- whoever told you that should get a life. everyone posts thing they're happy about on social media and why shouldn't they? if he has such a problem with it, he should have just blocked or unfollowed you"
b7fqph,"Have you ever thought that maybe your brother isn't interested in girls? Or at the very least, not right now?

You and your dad were the assholes. He's 16, leave him be. "
b7ft0m,NTA. He broke it he pays for it.
b7ftpb,NTA. There is generally a 5-10 minute grace period of waiting for the person to get their stuff. After that time is up you can remove their laundry and put it on the table or on top of the machine. So you're good. She should know the unwritten rules of the laundry room. 
b7fv4n,"NTA. The plan for the evening fell apart. You improvised, adapted, and overcame that to continue the fun."
b7fx9b,NTA.  I would have went shopping and pick them up when I'm done.
b7g147,YTA looking at the other posts she's 37 and you are 34. That's barely an age difference. You also filter only for girls under 27? That's a bigger age difference. 
b7g93b,"YTA - but mostly because you need anger management and not get yourself into these situations in the first place.  This is some childish shit, and you need to handle yourself in a more mature manner all around.
"
b7g9h7,"NTA. If you don’t like physical affection and especially if you have an actual condition that legitimately makes you averse to it, she should be the adult/parent and respect that vs insisting you cater to her preferences, regardless of cultural norms. "
b7g9l4,NTA. Taking care of a baby is fairly easy IF YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING. E and her boyfriend are massive assholes. 
b7gacf,"NTA: Ya'll broke up. She has every right to feel a little stung by it since it's still relatively fresh, but she has no right to be a giant dick about it. Not your partner, not your monkeys. Do you and enjoy your single life, kind of sounds like you dodged a bullet on the crazy train. "
b7gctv,ESH. You guys are having a competition. Stop comparing and just be a good friend and listen. When it’s your turn to complain she needs to leave her issues behind for a minute and listen to you. 
b7gkds,NTA. You proved your point by using his own argument. 
b7grc1,"YTA but only slightly.

Forward of him to invite you to meet family so soon, but YTA for asking him to ditch the event with his brother entirely to do something just you two.

Just say you don’t want to go and let the kid see his family."
b7gtx5,YTA. Don’t charge them for a price you didn’t pay.
b7gv85,"NAH. Incompatibility can manifest in many ways. You thought things had gotten better, she thought they couldn’t get any better. That she was unable/unwilling to communicate these feelings  is similar to your inability to communicate your feelings. 

Don’t beat yourself up. "
b7h5dg,"Wow someone actually enjoys something in their life, call the cops. "
b7h9kb,"NTA.

I'm amazed the DM isn't stepping in here and being like ""whoa whoa, you can't claim *all the loot and the castle* but still expect everyone else to help clear it out. That isn't how that works."" Because it isn't. You should be splitting the loot at least as normal and then she can buy the castle or barter it *because it was a group effort*. That's how D&D works."
b7hbow," NTA. You can’t change who you are, and even if you could, you shouldn’t. Your family will either accept you and support you and learn, or they won’t. You should just be yourself"
b7hbyd,NTA. I think you're over thinking this one. 
b7hezi,"YTA/YWBTA. ICE isn't there to solve your family problems, and you're considering doing this for the wrong reasons. "
b7hg5l,"YTA. You gave him the pitch, he wasn't interested. He doesn't want to, so leave him alone. He doesn't have to try just because you want him to!"
b7hhfw,YTA for not understanding her point of view. 
b7hhhv,NTA - he didn’t want to be “friends”. That’s how people get raped or murdered. Your instincts were probably right.
b7hi59,"NTA, but you will be if you DON'T report them.  Please help those dogs."
b7hkht,"NTA.. You can't say this to her mum though.. You can't even risk her mum finding out you think it. Your friend is a minor and without proof of abuse, stuck with her mum.  Things may get worse for her at home if you do this. Just be a good friend to her... encourage her with her schooling... help her get out of this mess when she is old enough and able to support herself   


Child of an abusive parent x "
b7hozp,"NTA x1000. It’s your wedding, and he’s a trash human being. "
b7hq06,"NAH

I'm confused.  That's pretty normal.  Try to dig deeper, because there's something missing from this puzzle."
b7hu9u,NTA. You did the right thing. I wish someone would have told me when I was cheated on.
b7i0bu,"NTA

And you should refuse him to stay at your place.

Your house, your rules. And if he won’t respect you or your rules then he can live somewhere else."
b7i3hg,"NTA - 

She is endangering her kids, and you called her out on it, no amount of ""research"" can stop a kid from contracting the measles. You are completely right, its dangerous. 

"
b7i4jq,"NAH- sending nudes can have very negative effects for so many reasons, as well as it being illegal in the US (not sure about other countries) if you are underage like your sister is. the only thing you should have done is talk to your sister first before talking to your mom, but it was the right thing to do"
b7i685,NTA it’s a card game. My family plays poker for skittles and starburst. It’s just a game. 
b7i8fu,"NTA. As much as I (also a fellow book nerd) hate the idea of a book never getting to be enjoyed, but I totally understand how this book—what you thought was a sweet, loving gesture from your dad and maybe even an olive branch to start repairing your tumultuous relationship—is now ruined. I’ll bet if he gave you a bag of diamonds and you later found out that he gave them to you so you’d “get over anxiety already,” that bag of diamonds would be worthless to you and forever be a reminder how your dad doesn’t take your mental illness seriously and has a bit of a dismissive attitude towards you.

I think your response will depend on what type of relationship you want to have with your dad. If you want to keep a polite, cordial relationship, you can keep up with the “Haven’t gotten around to reading it, sorry! ” or “I read it, but I didn’t fall in love with it as much as I’d hoped. Thank you for thinking of me anyway.” excuses.

Or you can be direct and say, “I heard that you were talking about the book you gave me and how you thought it would help me “get over” my anxiety. I want you to know that comments like that are very hurtful to me for X, Y, and Z reasons. I want to have a better relationship with you but we can’t do that if you have this attitude about my mental health. In the future, please don’t give me any gifts because you think they’ll help my anxiety unless I specifically ask you to. I’d like for us to give each other gifts because we think it’d be something the other person can enjoy and cherish, not to try to “fix” them.”"
b7i9e8,"ESH - yes she should be doing more but was that really how you told her that? Saying things like ""stupid,"" ""pathetic,"" and ""sad"" in a group chat full of people? Perhaps you could have messaged her privately to express your concerns and offer to help plan it. Yeah it sucks you would then have to do more planning, whereas typically the MoH should be in charge, but sometimes that's how it goes. "
b7i9nr,"NTA. If he doesn't want to get comments about his creepy porn stuff, he shouldn't show his creepy porn stuff to everyone at school."
b7i9ri,"NAH- but you should try and make some time to spend with your mom anyways. It might be hard, especially at first, but you only get so many opportunities and it will be beneficial to both of you in the long run "
b7icy2,"NTA.         
I did this the last two trimesters because I did the projects nearly by myself, one of which I had to completely rewrite 13 pages of material written by two 23yo 3rd graders. We do self grading though, and I didn’t fail them, just said they don’t deserve the same grade.         
Throwing your work off on someone else or potentially destroying your grade is being an asshole. And you deserve the credit you deserve, likewise with them. I say fuck ‘em"
b7iecz,"NTA, your school is going WAY overboard with these drills and is going to traumatize these kids for no reason."
b7ifra,NTA but I would also trade you for 2 million dollars.
b7ig0i,NTA. You are now patient zero. The others will start to fall. It was pretty dumb of your husband to have people over if you’ve got a stomach bug.
b7ihkm,"YTA. Her family is covering half the cost, you're staying with her other family and you've been together three years. Your reasons for not wanting to go honestly come off as very racist. There's more to Kenya than violent slums and white people visit Kenya all the time without problem. 

I'd be pretty hurt if my partner of 3 years didn't want to come with me to meet my family because he thought it'd be dangerous when I've assured him it's not. Get over yourself, dude. "
b7ikm1,"NTA

She brought herself to your home to evangelize to you. You tried to get her to fuck off politely and she wouldn't, so you got her to fuck off rudely.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
b7il0m,"YTA

You're only 3 months in you gotta save that shit for when you're like a turtle stuck on its back. Trust me. "
b7imed,"NTA In my opinion it’s rude to order something super expensive when someone is buying you food , pro tip is to ask what they recommend so you know their price range on how much they are willing to spend on food."
b7ioyv,"I don’t think you’re an asshole, but I do wonder if you’re a good friend.

I don’t know what you were thinking when you decided to to tell Beth that the 2 of you dated, everything after that pretty much follows on from the fact that Beth clearly feels she can’t fully trust you."
b7is53,"NTA

A ""nice"" thing done to you against your will is not ""nice"". A kiss is nice, but not when I said no. "
b7iv45,I didn’t say you can’t I said you shouldn’t. 
b7iy5a,NTA You don't owe favours to people who treat you poorly. Also you said that your husband goes back and forth on whether your feelings are justified. Excuse me? Re-read that. Your husband doesn't have to right to decide if YOUR feelings are justified. Gross.
b7izag,NAH. Probably just stood there to be next to her daughter.
b7izga,To add to the childishness(?) she blared music down my small cul de sac at 3:30 in the morning as my mate dropped me home. Thankfully my mate lowered the volume once he was in my driveway but man...I was pretty embarrassed 
b7j03v,"NTA. You didn't say anything wrong, you were being honest about your feelings, and not like it was the hosts business what you said in a text to your friend anyways.

Parent is straight up acting like a child, holding a grudge over something that happened in 6th grade.

Sorry you got left out OP, you didn't deserve that. "
b7j1ti,"YTA, 

First of all for involving your daughter in this dispute. 

Second of all for yelling and throwing a tantrum. 

Third for being a backseat driver. The driver needs to focus on the road and the GPS but you pulled up another GPS and started yelling. That’s too much information. 

A wrong turn is not that big a deal. Let the driver make a wrong turn, don’t yell about it, ask if they want a backup GPS, and if not then sit there and shut up. "
b7j3qo,NTA.  This sounds like an impulse decision that she’s going to regret after having to share a living space with children.  
b7j6hn,"NTA but ultimately just keep your head down, keep your income, and look for something else if it makes you uncomfortable. You don’t have to be their cheerleader, but that also doesn’t preclude you from just showing up and doing your job until you find something better. Standing on your moral code here is just going to get you fired, for no real value"
b7j78v,"NAH, just talk to her about it"
b7j7j3,"YTA

People are still people even if you're paying them to do something. Without knowing the details I find it hard to believe that you couldn't find a way to let him have his day without threatening him. But even with details aside I can tell you're the asshole just by how you view and treat him. "
b7jcxr,"NTA. It’s an extension of *your home*. You need to feel comfortable with the people who stay there, and if you can’t trust this dude to follow such simple instructions, you have no obligation to welcome him into your home. "
b7jdql,YTA for burning bridges over a jersey. Grow up.
b7jevw,"NTA. Grieving people don't tend to think rationally and in my opinion you were being a good friend by gently warning her that she might be burning the bridge on a friendship with her harsh words. From what you said it sounds possible to me that he was hurting and couldn't handle the service and had to leave, but her anger isn't letting her consider that. Even if he did just leave to go get laid she doesn't have the right to dictate how others deal with loss. "
b7jinq,"NAH

That being said, you can't control another person and expect them to be happy about it, especially with the weird parental involvement.

You should have done it through friends, and never have let your parents handle it.

I understand why you did what you did, but I understand her writing you off because of how it was handled."
b7jjw7,NTA.  Also unless your dad is your manager it doesn’t really matter what he thinks.
b7jp3k,YTA for saying “killerbaby” during a time where women are fighting for a basic right to their bodies. I get you meant it in a joking way but people take that stuff very seriously
b7jpdb,"No judgment here, but please get and stay sober. Your boyfriend may have been trying to help; he may be an asshole. 

But your first concern should be to stay clean and sober. If it ends in a hospital visit, you probably need help. "
b7jr6d,ESH. His wife comes first now and that's normal. Him asking you to get an extra ticket after you mentioned having to take out a loan to get them is appalling.
b7js1k,"YTA. Your son lives far enough away that he’d have to make an overnight trip at least. He’s working two jobs to support himself and doing the best he can. He’s said he will try to get the time off, what more do you expect him to do? Co-ordinating with two different employers to get time off is probably complicated, and it sounds like he’s working fairly low paid/minimum wage jobs, so it’s not like he’s so essential that his bosses can be relied on to be accommodating and he can afford to make demands.

You’re not being understanding enough of his circumstances and you’re taking out family history stuff that has nothing to do with him out on him."
b7jvbe,[deleted]
b7k4dm,"ESH. She is for obvious reasons, you are for not communicating like an adult. You should have talked to her about it, tell her your doubts, and if she didn’t respond favorably or if you still felt uneasy then you should have just broken it off. No reason to stay with someone you’re always doubting, whether your suspicions are justified or not. "
b7k5am,"ESH - You could not have picked a more inappropriate time to air this grievance publicly, and you know it."
b7kc4k,"YTA - i get that there's history here, but, oddly, sadly, i have experience in this matter.  My family now has a rule.  He who throws piss is always in the wrong."
b7kdah,"NTA. You're in no way the asshole of the situation for taking control of your own mind and body. Although you've been together for a good amount of time, what matters most for your mind and body is what you decide is best. Although I'm sure he only has the best intentions and wants the best for you, the best for *you* is what you decide you is. "
b7kfx7,"NTA. From what you say it seems like she is in a position where she can choose if she wants to live 50/50 or just live with her biological mom. She's been driven to a corner, and living with her dad is making her miserable, even if it isn't her dad's fault. Her dad needs to either understand how miserable the step-mom makes her feel and accept her choice (even though I'm sure it will be hard for him), or he should try to control the situation, trying to reach compromise with the step-mom, and it looks like he wasn't able/willing to control the situation. So she should choose not to live miserably 50% of the time if she can"
b7kg7h,NAH - I often avoid people I know in public. 
b7kj7w,"NTA. From what you say your SO didn't even get upset at you or thought you had any kind of obligation to defend him in the moment. Your friend thought that you had that obligation, and expressed it in a way that was too aggressive (""got mad at me"")."
b7ko06,NTA whatsoever. It is entirely healthy to cut toxic people from your life. You owe your abuser no explanation. 
b7ktxx,"NTA, she should be keeping a better eye on her kid... He's only 4... So should be under constant supervision"
b7l4cq,"NTA

Your girlfriend isn't the asshole either its the other guy, You need to talk to your girlfriend about this guy and try to figure out what his problem is. You and your girlfriend seem supportive of each other its this other guy that's the issue. She had friends there to look out for her it isn't like you left her in a crowd of complete strangers with no one else. You could also calmly confront the guy to figure out why he reacts so negatively to you. It could be a miss understanding."
b7l92a,NTA. Explain why and if she freaks out ask for a manager or get the area managers number. Her nails poking through the gloves is clearly against h&s regulations
b7law8,"How old are you guys??? This is some high school drama. In the adult world, it's totally normal for couples to spend more time with each other than their friends. It's kind of expected. "
b7lceb,"YTA
I Understand your feelings and concernd, but they are a Packet deal.
Your cousin probably won't come then too, and maby cut ties with you because of that.

"
b7li76,"If you keep it factual than NAH (because your friend isn’t TA either). If random dude has been couch surfing and can’t keep down a job, your friend is going to be stuck bailing him out or get evicted at some near point in the future. However, you need to both get something locked down ASAP so you both feel secure. "
b7lix6,"NTA - You are in an abusive relationship/friendship, and if you can't handle it you don't have to. Especially if it's significantly degrading your own quality of life and mental health. 

Note: Mental health problems are serious issues, and people need to care for each other and pay attention. But, you can only do so much. Where the line of ""too much"" is depends on the situation. "
b7lluf,"YTA - Stop trying to be an edgy teenager, what other people believe in is their business. "
b7llvu,NTA. Your husband sounds paranoid and controlling and is clearly making assumptions about this guy. Your daughter hasn't done anything.
b7lsq5,"NTA, you handled the situation pretty tactfully. The feelings of guilt you're having are because she's suffering the pain of rejection which was inevitable no matter what. Whether you talked to Helen yourself or had someone else do it, she was going to feel this way. 

You seem like you've been pretty respectful towards her. You'd be the asshole if you were making fun of her, but it sounds to me like you're just trying to navigate your way out of a shitty situation."
b7lw4p,"NTA - If Meg was uncomfortable she could have organised a ride home, uber, a taxi or public transport. It's really unsafe and irresponsible to have someone that out of it drive home. This could have been the death of all three of you just because she wanted to leave. She was the asshole, not you. "
b7lx1x,"NTA
People aren’t understanding why you’re upset. Yes she’s cheating on her partner like a sludge of a human, and you’re free to not want to associate with her because her fix for a marriage in trouble is to cheat. But you also took time off and set up lunch and then she asks you “how long will this take, I need to set up a bootycall”. Making you feel like your lunch was an inconvenience. I think that telling her that if she would rather do that, then to feel free to,and then let her know you won’t reschedule would have been more straightforward. Instead you canceled and made excuses not to reschedule, and then you blocked her. Still not the asshole because it’s your free time, but maybe be honest next time. "

b7na9w,"NTA Baby items are things that should be researched before buying and the parents should feel confident in the products they're using to keep their baby safe. Personally, if you have a registry and people know about it and choose to buy an item that isn't on the registry, I find that kinda rude. 

My MIL asked me for my baby registry, bought a couple items off of it, and still decided to buy us some items that were cheaper versions of what we had picked out (and had worse ratings.) I felt no guilt returning the items and exchanging for the ones I picked out and was more comfortable using.

If you don't like what you got, return it and get the one you want. If people ask why, tell them the truth. You researched extensively and picked one out that you felt comfortable using and they decided to ignore that. It's not your fault and it's not being ungrateful. Registrys are there for a reason. "

When she asked for it back for the SIL, you should have just given it back. You don’t get to keep things that aren’t yours just because people are unreasonable in asking for them back. 

At the same time, your sister doesn’t seem to understand how either gift giving or selling things works. You can’t demand the return of gifts (the bassinet) or loan things to people, and then later demand that they pay you for the use of the items (the swing).

b7or1r,"NAH

Your fiancé has been placed in a horrible position where they must provide for their little brother. Just because the brother is 18, doesn’t mean he’s ready or able to be self sufficient. Many people rely on their parents into their mid twenties. To suddenly lose that support is terrible and hard to recover from.

You are caught in the middle of this and it’s understandable that you don’t want to move in. 

However, your fiancé is mourning and dealing with the reality of death in the way they know how and trying to gain back control in their life. 

I would try and find a compromise. Like maybe you can help the little brother find a job and move out and he can visit you guys often. Something so your fiancé feels like they’re taking care of their family. The house is a large expense though and your fiancé may want to keep it. That’s another conversation about who has rights to it and what to do with it. "

However, she wouldn't be the asshole if she said no.

They don’t even know you two know each other unless I’m missing something. They probably have multiple applicants for all the various roles they are advertising, all at various stages of the process from still scheduling interviews to already making offers. 

The guy was annoyed with her for wasting the company’s time and not giving them an answer. She’s coming across as someone who doesn’t really want their offer and is holding out for something better (which apparently In fact she is) and frankly that’s quite dumb of her because she doesn’t even have a job right now so she may as well take what she can get instead of sour her relationship with this prospective employer by seeming reluctant. If she doesn’t get another offer she runs the risk they will lose patience with her and rescind this offer, or even if she takes the job she will be starting off on a bad footing already.

I'm a Native American, of the [Salinan Indian Tribe of California.](http://salinantribe.com) (I point this out not to engage in a logical fallacy such as an appeal to authority or an appeal to pity or as an attack on a person--but only to frame my own perspective on this.)

> Recently, I (a white woman) was telling a friend (another white woman) about these plates ... I showed my friend the pictures and told her this, and she told me that I could not keep the plates. She said owning a set of dishes with Native American writing on them was cultural appropriation and I was disrespecting a culture by owning them.

(\*rolls eyes\*)

Okay, first, the only people I've seen complain about ""cultural appropriation"" are ""whites."" (I use the term ""whites"" in quotes because there really is no ""white"" culture, but there is Irish, Scottish, English, French, German, Spanish, and Russian culture, just to name a few groups of folks who generally land under the ""white"" category.) To be blunt, I'm not particularly a fan of someone outside of my tribe or the tribes of other Native Americans to be ""represented"" by an outsider who doesn't know the ways of that tribe. (And one could argue your friends claims about what the Cherokee believe is the real cultural appropriation here.)

(Edit to add: Yes, yes, yes; I know; there are plenty of folks with feathers in headbands running around claiming cultural appropriation. But then when my tribe did its geneaology for application to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, we discovered some of the most vocal ""members of our tribe"" were actually not descendant from the Smithsonian-maintained rolls from the turn of the century or the California rolls maintained as part of a couple of lawsuits. They were instead relatives by marriage--and were not Native American at all. So a lot of folks screaming ""cultural appropriation""--well, I take that sort of thing with a large grain of salt.)

Second, if an object is sacred to a tribe, it sure as hell would not have been sold to someone else for a buck. Native Americans aren't that stupid, ya know...

So no, you're not being an asshole to keep plates inherited from your grandmother, plates your grandmother bought from some Native Americans. Your friend is being a fool and somewhat of an ass trying to represent the opinions and culture of a tribe *she did not grow up in.*

Now, personally, if I knew I had an object with the Sequoyah alphabet on it, I'd be curious and try to translate it. I'd bet a small amount of money that it's either part of the Lord's Prayer or part of the lyrics of Amazing Grace. Both were some of the first works to be translated into a Native American dialect by earlier settlers attempting to convert Native Americans to Christianity.

Which then begs the question: is a Sequoyah translation of a biblical passage cultural appropriation of the Cherokee culture? Or are the Cherokee appropriating Christian culture?

Or is the whole bit about ""cultural appropriation"" just foolish nonsense spouted by overly sensitive whites trying to punch another notch in their ""sensitivity to victims"" card?

(Sorry for being so crass--but, again, as a Native American, this sort of nonsense drives me batty.)"

You mispronouncing it on purpose does not prove a point - it just shows that you think japanese names are ""weird"" and are being an asshole about it on purpose. Like your partner and stepson are both asian - how do you think that might make them feel about how you might view them?"
b7t9h4,"YTA this might not be popular, but you should have at least shut down the conversation. 
I understand that you were their ride and still waiting on your food. And while that may have made things uncomfortable, life is full of uncomfortable situations. How we handle them matters. If anything because you were the driver you actually had a better situation then if one of them were. 
I would have went with ESH since your friend chose to end your relationship, however you seemed to continue a friendship with the girls who were badmouthing her, so there's a loss of trust. 

Edit to ESH due to OP not continuing with hitchhiker friendship. 
They suck for bad mouthing, you suck for not standing up for your best friend, and she sucks for not forgiving. .

b7txyk,"YTA, this is why nobody likes vegans. Even other vegans are annoyed by how in your face vegan you are. It's a ~~diet~~ lifestyle, not a personality.

Edit: the recurring argument I'm seeing is ""it's a lifestyle, not a diet"" and I'm not sure if you guys are intentionally missing my point or if it's just hard to see from the other side.  It could be a religion or a cult for all I care, my point was that nobody outside your group cares.  It's not interesting, it's not unique, it doesn't make you better than everyone.  It's a moral belief of yours which you are entitled to, but acting morally superior has never won someone over to a cause that requires such drastic adjustment of their day to day lives.  This is why vegans are disliked."

How would you feel if your mom took a scarf you'd saved your money up to buy her, and spent an afternoon shopping for and unnecessarily ruined it? ""Sorry son.

See the problem with these 4chan idiots is they claim everything is a joke. For some it is, for others that excuse is a cover for the fact that they don't have the balls to say what they really think.  Its not up to your sister to answer the question about whether or not you are racist, you should be able to answer that for yourself.  Nowhere in the interaction you posted did you tell her you thought the jester just means ok and nowhere in that interaction did she call you racist.  Yet in the question you pose at the end you state both those things, maybe if you want to avoid these kinds of conflicts you should just say what you think, whatever that may be. "

b7yyfo,"I wouldn’t recommend this. It’s rude, presumptuous and tacky. Donate your own money. I wouldn’t stay friends with someone who was so judgmental about me spending my own money.

Telling other people how to spend their money, no matter how charitable your intentions, is rarely a good idea. "

My parents got me a cat (had dogs all my life) when they noticed my mental health declining and he really helps me, my dogs do as well. 

Being able to take care of some other living being like that gives reason to get out of bed and do things, sometimes you need to do things for others rather than yourself to get yourself out of the slumps. 

Also I love German shepherds I’m so jealous! 

If you’re still on the fence about it, talk to your therapist :) I think it’s a good idea and I wouldn’t listen to your friends and family’s “what if’s” especially since your landlord is helping you find a dog. So nice!"

b838ql,"NAH... I don't think your mom had any bad intentions on calling this out to you, I think she was just a little overly concerned with how you present yourself (depending upon how upset she got with you, she might be the asshole). That being said, there is nothing wrong with wearing a sports bra like that in public, [people do it all the time.](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-okay-to-wear-a-sports-bra-in-public) Her argument is also a bit flawed, children and men will see women wearing similar clothes on the beach and at the gym, so why should you be considered at fault for exposing this fact to them?"

So here's a little of my own imagining of the story: if your gf has been with you for a while she probably knows a lot about your condition and how you manage it... and if she thinks you were unpleasant on her birthday and not making an effort for her, then who am I to argue with her? She knows better than any of us about how well you normally manage this condition and what your effort level is. "

States Where an Engagement Ring Must Be Returned

Many courts look at an engagement ring as a conditional gift that is given in expectation of marriage. Conditional means, ""subject to one or more conditions or requirements being met or granted on certain terms."" In such instances, if there is no marriage, then the engagement ring needs to be returned.

The courts also have held in these states that the reasoning for no-fault divorces holds for no-fault broken engagements so an engagement ring should always be returned regardless of who decided to call off the engagement."

b83kf1,"NAH

The old lady was just confused. She thought you were cutting in the line"
b83lr1,"NTA. Your kids, your call, period. It sucks that she couldn’t respect that. "
b83npx,"NTA- as long as you don't give minimum wage employees shit for doing there jobs, there is nothing wrong with holding a large cooperation accountable for shitty practice. "
b83nsh,"NTA. I was no-poo for 3 years and my girlfriend did the same thing. She wasn't a fan of sniffing my hair. 

Compromise. The harmful ingredients in shampoo mostly surround sulfates, silicon, and parabens. Tell him to try co-washing (conditioner only) to make it smell better while still keeping hair gloriously volumic. ArtNaturals makes a great Argan Oil shampoo/conditioner with none of those 3 harmful ingredients. I switched to that, once every 2-3 days and now she loves sniffing my hair. 

Or if he's still unwilling, do like some kind of 75% water / 25% apple cider vinegar mix and wash the hair that way. Be careful if using ACV though.
"
b83oy2,YTA. You brought the coffee into the bed and it spilled. Wash the sheets. 
b83p2x,NTA -  believe whatever you want and allow others to do the same.
b83q6v,"NTA. Your friends were in the wrong. However, you might want to reanalyze why no one likes your girlfriend. You say she’s just shy by that’s a lot of hostility for your family to have towards someone for no reason. There’s obviously a part of the story missing here. "
b83u92,"NAH

Are you paying the kids to perform at your wedding? If not, then YTA for expecting them to do something nice for you without any recompense.

edited to change vote"
b83yfg,"NTA - She's an asshole for always being late. She is basically saying ""my time is more important than everyone else's"". Being constantly late to everything is a choice. She is choosing to be late and that makes her an asshole.  "
b83zwu,"NTA

Strange theat, but if it works then good. Your gf should not be forced to burden her mother's debts like this. "
b84144,"NTA- I am so sorry for your friend, but he is veering into extremely creepy, stalker behavior and this is probably pretty scary for his ex. You don't do him any favors by pretending this is acceptable. Could you have been nicer? Maybe, I didn't hear your tone or specific words. But I also think people in his state of mind will take any softening and hold on to that as opposed to the main message. "
b841oq,"NAH

You're clearly not helping your brother by doing this, but it's not your intention to hurt him either.

Maybe in future, make your posts about the stuff you get visible to everyone except your brother?
"
b8454t,NTA - Obviously you should tell her doctor that her mental health is deteriorating to the point she is being violent and threatening. How is this even a question? What is there to gain by not saying anything?

>but if it’s with my current girlfriend, I think I would be okay with just one.

Famous last words of people who resent the children they have. Be sure it's what you want."
b84fhw,ESH. you say it was 7 years ago yet y'all acting like you're 17. 
b84j69,ESH. This whole exchange was extremely juvenile.
b84jnd,"NAH, as long as you approach him privately and present it as information, not criticism.  "
b84k0a,"NTA

Just love that puppy"
b84o1g,"NTA. I think she's lying and trying to make you feel bad. If she really had meant to send a message to someone else, she would have told you BEFORE the event. It was a stand-up thing to accompany her to her event just so she wouldn't be alone, and even if it was awkward, she should have been thankful of your efforts."
b84pkv,"NTA

Your logic is sound.  I wouldn't talk to her either."
b84rj2," YTA, I mean really you suggest he starts a band then goes right for his band mate?

It’s really creepy to be honest."

 Change due to Edit: You have a right to know what you want to know. You do not have a right to inflict that on them if they have made it clear they prefer ignorance. 


~~NAH~~. Be careful what you open Pandora. "
b84rzq,"NTA. He made a threat with implied physical harm. There's no way around that. Apparently, he thought that was OK, or he didn't mean it because he is mad. Either way, big red flag.

I don't get what the big deal is about shaking his desk? Are all his fragile antiques on there?"
b84wxm,"NTA but A lot of cruises have an option to have the wedding prior to disembarkment so that all guests don't have to take the cruise. 

Do you know when on the cruise they will be getting married or of this is an option?"
b84xxt,"Pre-edit: no assholes. Do not turn down an opportunity just to spare her feelings. You will likely wind up being resentful and thinking of what might have been. Seriously, congrats - it sucks she didn't get in, but that is not your fault. You did, you earned it, enjoy.

No assholes bc it's not like the sister knows and has been awful to you....yet

Post-edit: NTA, sister is great, parents are the assholes, OP is probably just as smart as her sister but they have been running her down her whole life. "
b8514w,"NTA. You’re not involved in the argument, so you’ve got no reason to get involved. Your parents should have spoken directly with your brother rather than drag you into it, when you’ve clearly stated to them that you don’t want to get involved. "
b8515i,"YWBTA if you give a command or start a bad-faith, accusatory discussion.

YWNBTA if you start a good-faith conversation expressing your concerns. You're allowed to have feelings. "
b853z5,"YTA if you do this. You have the best of intentions, and you could be completely right about your mom not being over your dad, but either way it isn't your place to get in the way of a relationship. There are a few reasons to do this, but if your father is as over her as he seems then just let her move on. Maybe it's not the right call, but maybe it is. Being hung up on your dad is between her and her boyfriend now."
b854jl,"NAH. You didn't do anything wrong by bringing up something you didn't know would upset her, and she didn't do anything wrong by having an emotional reaction and then discussing it with you. She may have thought she could be more open to discussing this with a thin friend than she actually can be, people tend to underestimate how much something will upset them when thinking about it before it actually happens. 

Nobody here had any bad intentions, people are complicated and feelings are hard, don't discuss dieting/weight gain/weight loss with her anymore and make sure to be supportive of her self-image by telling her about things you love about her appearance that are within her control. Compliments like ""I love when you wear your hair that way, it's so pretty"" and ""That lip color was made for you"" help people feel good about the skill of presenting themselves well, rather than the genetic lottery of their metabolism and average body size."
b857s5,"NAH. Sounds like you guys low-key hate each other, though, so maybe ESH?"
b85bl4,"ESH. They’re obviously shitty, maybe consider who you’re hanging out with if all your friends trash a fuly functional but brain damaged, maybe they aren’t the best.

 You had your opportunity and your ego won.  You can try to make it up later by hanging out with him individually and telling your ‘friend’ group. Then maybe bring him in."
b85fu0,NTA. You're responsible for every aspect of your child's safety and privacy. And it's not ridiculous to want to keep your child off social for as long as you think is best for them. 
b85gsb,"YTA  


Hear me out. You're not the asshole in a bad kind of way. I know how it feels to have a beloved pet and not want to say goodbye. But by your own statement, he's the equivalent of a 90 year old man. There's no uphill from here. Sure he may make it a few more months, but that's with intense veterinary care, and even then he might have to be heavily medicated. The prime of his life has come and gone, he deserves a rest. Take some time to think about this, and process it. But I do think it's time to say goodbye."
b85l15,"NTA. Wow, morally there are certain things you just do not joke about on April Fools Day. Your mom is an extreme asshole. "
b85mrl,"NAH, you don’t have to be friends with anyone you don’t like. You do sound a little possessive over your friendship with the other girl though if you’re saying they “forced” their way in."
b85mzb,"Yes, YTA for not wanting to be seen with him based on acne.    
Additionally though, is he potentially using steroids?"
b85pcz,YTA - you technically don’t look American either. Why the hell would you tell someone they don’t look American? That’s just you saying that white people look American 
b85t7m,"NTA. It might seem like a dick move, but you have to protect yourself. The company is under no obligation to look out for your best interest, and telling them you are looking to get pregnant before getting hired is the surest way to not get hired."
b85v0c,"NAH. She wants to stick with hers, you want to go to yours. Do your own things."
b85y0o,You are NTA in this scenario. I would also contact the pharmacist myself if I were you and officially compliment the CA on how she handled the situation. 
b85y9w,"YTA unless you bought them yourself.    
Why do you need so many dryer sheets anyway?"
b863qm,"NTA. It sucks dealing with a family member like this, I hope he gets well. I wouldn't tell him about the storage locker but if you are honest about why you hid them it might get through his brain that he has a problem. Good luck. r/justnofamily might be a good place to look at for support if you need it, btw. "
b865eq,"NTA:

She wasn't 'his'. She is her own person and made her own choices. Your boy's got a bad case of entitlement and not seeing women as people. 

And he needs to stop blaming other people for his serious lack of game. 

*edit* added a few words. Grammar, yo."
b867r3,NTA - I have never understood why if someone has forgiven a person they get mad if you don't forgive them as well.  You can forgive him and make peace with him in your own time and only if you would like to do so.  
b86822,NTA and she wanted you to do all the work on homework that she should had done by herself.

b86ihv,"NTA
Your SM is a manipulative demanding asshole who does not seem to hear a word you say. I suspect she insisted upon paying because she thought it would force you to obey her orders. It's good to form an independent unit with your spouse, right from the beginning. You're doing it right."
b86ip1,"NAH. I think you need to work on your anxiety issues, and that doesn't make you an asshole, dear. "
b86ljg,"NTA, I have no clue who my third cousins even are lol. "
b86pga,"NTA, I can't believe people are saying you need to split 50/50. He didn't do a damn thing to earn that money, so I think he should take his $400 and deal. If you want, calculate the going interest rate for the $400 ""loan"" you got from him and add it to the original $400. He's not entitled to money he didn't work for."
b86t5v,"NAH - This is why you don't do these types of holidays. Something like this always comes up. If you want to do a holiday with friends, set it up so everyone is solely responsible for their own costs. If they back-out it won't impact the rest of the group. "
b86twl,SHP - Who cares?
b86xqy,"NTA holy cow hahahahaha.          
The bartender is the asshole here wow. "
b871sk,"NTA - sounds like a blessing in disguise. I would never sell a used car of mine to a friend, only because if it were to die the next day it would be VERY awkward. You don't want to be getting calls days, weeks, months, later with complaints about ""the brakes need replacing! You never said that when I bought it!"" etc."
b8724c,"ESH or maybe NAH? Either way you’re both on the same level. You both suck for watching a movie without the other when it was agreed that you would watch it together. But at the same time, it’s almost like neither of you is an asshole because you both did it to each other. I can’t decide!"
b873i4,"NTA

Tell her to drop a few bucks on a sleeping mask."
b8795w,"NTA- it doesn't sound like she's being very understanding of your side at all. You have already accommodated her a lot by including her- if she can't understand why you need some time to be with your friends who you hardly see I don't really know what to tell you. Having couples involved always changes the dynamic - it's not fair to you or your friends. It's totally understandable you want a few days where you aren't worry if she's having fun or if she understands old jokes, etc. She's an adult - if she can't fly a alone that's something she needs to work on."
b87d6v,You're both too old for this. 
b87iia,"Well, I guess it really depends on what kind of Blood he is running with.  Where I came from, there is a strict blood in blood out policy so asking him to denounce his gang is like asking him to commit suicide.  As for getting the legal job part, I would say that is it is extreme hard for an ex-convict to find one that pay anything above poverty rate.  I am not in any way trying to justify what his is doing.  All I am saying is that the lifestyle he chose for himself in the past is extremely hard to get away from.

As for you question, you do you.  If you don't want to associate with the people your cousin associate with or doing, you are well within your right to do so."
b87o4q,"YTA.

>I defended myself saying it's not a big deal and, eventually I got a little frustrated and said that I'm just humanizing a person who is gone, and that you should be able to joke about anything and everything. 

You don't get to joke about someone's dead father and decide that they should be ok with it because ""you should be able to joke about anything and everything""."
b87tc7,"NTA.

But it sounds like she, and your father, need a lot more help with things other than showering. Maybe sit down and talk with your mom about being honest with herself."
b87tf1,[deleted]
b87wir,"NTA.

> He told me if it weren't for her then I would have had to pay so it's only fair if I still give my half.

That's some ass backwards logic. The friend paid for all gas and tolls, why the hell does your roommate need your money?"
b87xav,"ESH, unless you have a medical condition that requires it, putting your feet on seats that other people will sit on later is just an asshole thing to do, regardless if it’s directly occupied or someone is sitting close to it. Your shoes could be dirty and it’s just one of those common courtesies. 

The other guy is an asshole for pushing your feet off the chair, getting physical with a stranger isn’t ok. But then you were an asshole again by yelling something at him that you can’t even seem to remember. 

Overall impolite, immature communication between you two.

Edit: I’ve never been to a baseball game, and judging by the comments it’s very common to put your feet up. Still unpleasant of OP to provoke and then yell at the guy, in my book it’s still ESH"
b886j6,NTA You aren't obligated to deal with somebody you find toxic and hard to be around. She complained about you not trying to keep in touch but nothing stopped her from messaging you sooner.
b88bd5,"YTA if you do it over text. If you can’t do it in person, do it at least over the phone. 5 years and a breakup over text is a slap in the face. "
b88kb3,"NAH. He’s just got a different sex drive than you. I think we grow up in a world that teaches us that women only put up with sex, while men want it all the time. So when we (as women) are rejected, it stings. We think men should ALWAYS want it so something must be wrong with us when they don’t.  

None of that is true, though. Men can have low sex drives too. Some people can shrug and do it for their partners even if they’re not super into it, some people can’t. If that is a big problem for you, that’s okay! You’re just incompatible. But there’s nothing at all WRONG with you just because he’s got a low sex drive. "
b88n9l,[deleted]
b88x63,"NTA. This is petty. If the baby has a big head, then the baby has a big head and jokingly pointing it out is the most normal thing ever. Jeez. 

Edit: Wow, a lot of these YTA comments sound like they come from big headed babies. What has happened to people? Weird times man. I would just laugh and say ""you're soo meeeaan shut up."" Theres way more important things to get butt hurt about in life. Grow up people. Yeah yeah we get it, your virtuous and morally above everyone, now piss off. "
b890wq,"YTA it’s business. Who knows if your fav gym will find a new home. I’d welcome the idea of more options and if you think about it... they are filling a void. 

Has the old gym even updated on their progress to find a new home? The longer they go without reopening, the less likely it is they ever will. "
b893ba,YTA - you made a public accusation without proof.
b89549,"NTA

I don't know anything about the church he's attending, so I can't necessarily pin it on them.  But at least part of the problem is that your son is 15.  He's going to give you guys shit about more than just your godliness."
b895q3,NTA: It's clear she's acting like a child. 
b899k7,"ESH

You were rude for taking up such a large table for one person. You also could have voiced your displeasure but chose not to do so. They were rude for not asking first. "
b89bca,"YTA

You're purposely misleading the women you meet in order to manipulate their opinion of you, and now you're trying to justify it.

Joke's on you, though, as it's going to backfire every time."
b89gll,"NTA - He got an amazing opportunity, that doesn't mean you need to cancel all your plans. Tell him you're really happy he has this chance, but you've been looking forward to seeing the movie on its opening night for a while now, and just like you don't expect him to change his plans for your prom, he shouldn't expect you to change yours for him."
b89gpb,"NTA. Your kids do not need to be exposed to that kind of negativity, whether directed at them or at their mom. 

Also like...context on the bra? Was your daughter like ""hey grandma something feels uncomfortable here, can you help"" and GM offered a bra to help with that, or was the GM like ""you have to wear a bra now?"""
b89gws,WNBTA - this has progressed beyond over night guest and is affecting your safety and security. 
b89im0,"NTA.  This sub is full of people who wait around for threads involving feminism or any kind of political correctness to tell people who express any kind of feminist views that they're the asshole. It's probably because of the demographics most attracted to a subreddit entirely dedicated to judging other people.... 

Anyway, it's 2019, if he's going to date a woman, especially a Hispanic woman, he should be prepared to occasionally listen to her frustrations with living in a world where women experience discrimination. He shouldn't have hung up on you. It would have been better if he waited for you to be done ranting and then told you that it made him feel icky to be lumped in with men who discriminate against women, so that you could have a chance to clarify that you didn't mean to imply he was oppressive, but that certain men even in your own family are.

You might have been tactless in the way you phrased it and you may want to work a little bit on how to bring sensitive issues up in a way that doesn't make people feel attacked, but he needs to grow up a little bit and realize that empathizing with a perspective different from his own is part of having an intimate relationship. If he wants to only talk to people who speak from a white male perspective he's welcome to date white men."
b89jvx,"IDK, I feel like I've often had better luck diffusing delicate issues with some light humor. There are certain times that call for direct honesty, and others that call for some levity."
b89l89,"NAH - Your intentions are good but it might be annoying for them. Just ask! Go to them and say ""Hey, happy to grab your packages on my lunch break or I can leave them on your porch, whichever is most convenient for you."""
b89ncr,"YTA

Look, if you can't handle dog poop... don't get a dog.

The fact that you expect other people to pick up after your dog makes you clearly the asshole."
b89r8u,"NTA. You’re not even withdrawing the offer, from my understanding. You’re just choosing to not continuously reaffirm and offer that always gets declined. If they want to visit, they’ll visit. No point in always asking. "
b89soi,"YTA, or this is a shit post. How was that a prank? You harmed the cat, took away its food and sense of safety, and essentially assaulted your friend by making them have an asthma attack. What the fuck is wrong with you?"
b89tab,YTA- grow up. What are you gonna sit there having a conversation the whole time?
b89vgc,nta but move the fuck out dude
b8a19f,YTA for making a rash decision affecting an animal's life. But just say it wasn't a good fit.
b8a2y8,"NTA  


Based on your edit, it doesn't sound like she was adding *any* value to the group, and was in fact hurting a lot of people. It's not on you to teach her how not to be a dick to people. If she was just a bit awkward, fine, but mean? Hell no."
b8a30f,"NTA. He’s using his disability to get away with creepy behavior and to manipulate you. Don’t let him take advantage of you, especially if you feel so uncomfortable. 

He got around somehow before he met you, it’s not your responsibility to help him with his mobility. There’s professional ways to get that help, if he urgently needs it there’s options like guide dogs. Again, not your job. "
b8a35o,"NAH.  It's your home.  If you don't want somebody in it, your wife and SIL can make arrangements to meet him elsewhere.  Why can't your wife be in contact with him, though?  She may have slept with him years ago, but you're the one she married."
b8a6zk,"ESH. That’s disgusting... a grown woman should know to have basic courtesy and clean up after herself. On the other hand, it was uncalled for to publically humiliate her in your office. She can’t recover from that. Shitty situation here. And there. And everywhere.

Edit: just saw OP’s update. It makes the situation better that there was no one else around, but yelling at her was still harsh. A civil conversation first may have been more appropriate. If she continues being disgusting after that then, well.. that’s another story. Judgement remains the same."
b8ak4n,"NTA- ""she should've stood up for herself"" is something a predator would say. Being famous doesn't void your right to consent to such things. Ask him how he would feel if a man did that to you.

&#x200B;

I would be careful with him, because he is quite literally victim blaming. This could be a red flag as to how he perceives women and even you."
b8almn,"YTA. chill out dude. 

just tell people you haven't set a date yet... lmao. "
b8alnq,"YTA. Your brother is an adult. He is entitled to make choices and he will have to deal with the consequences of his actions. Is dating a married man ideal or laudable, no, _but it's not actually your problem to deal with or solve._ You are not your brother's keeper. Sidenote, there is nothing inherently ""wrong"" or ""shady"" about a big age difference, it doesn't sound like this guy is preying on or abusing your brother, so that's just some misguided notions of appropriateness.

You said your peace to your brother, fine. Your brother decided to do what he wanted to do, also fine. Tattling to your dad was not your place, you come across as salty that your brother didn't just do what you wanted. Grow up.

_Then_ you lied to your brother over a conflict between him and your dad, which never would have existed had you not brought it up, that your dad frankly didn't need to know about. Oh how fucking awful, your brother had a hookup over, it doesn't matter how old the guy is, get over it. So even more assholery. Your dad had the right initial reaction of ""he's an adult, so it's his bad choice to make,"" then the follow up reaction is just as ludicrous as yours. 

You're the asshole all around and it's not your dad's place at all to break this up either.

If you want to leave a note for the wife, fine, but expect this all to blow up in your and/or your dad's faces badly, you deserve it. There was surprisingly minimal drama at the start of this ""married guy is hooking up with my brother"" affair, and all the fuel to the fire was added by you. 

If you have the opportunity, pull that note off the door. "
b8aqew,"NTA 

I’m almost certain his aim was to make you jealous if you didn’t talk for two days after a fight and he just HAD to let the world know two cute girls thought he was cute too 🙄"
b8au5w,NTA. This prank was pretty innocent but your brother was a bit immature. 
b8aywk,"NTA. You sound like a great person! People are allowed to be annoyed by others, but ganging up on someone behind their back like that is just mean. "
b8azyq,NTA. I understand there are cultural differences here but never be friends with someone who seems to be disgusted by your mere existence. Respect yourself enough to find people who love and accept you
b8b127,NTA. Your family sounds really complicated and clearly you don’t know everything that happened between the older generation. It doesn’t sound like it should have been your job to inform your aunt of the situation. 
b8b2n8,"NTA But you should visit him anyway, mostly to support your other family members. Death of family is hard, whether they're dicks or not."
b8b3af,"NTA - it’s your hair, you can choose what to do with it."
b8b4zq,"YTA. She's Indian too. 

If anything, come on, you should be helping her to better understand and appreciate Indian culture. I understand where you're coming from, but if you're Indian yourself my humble opinion is that you should empower her to have the Indian wedding she wants in the most respectful and comprehensive way possible. That's what friends do, and that's how you work through the issue of cultural appropriation. Win-win situation.

It's her wedding, be supportive."
b8b50l,"Interesting one... I'm going with NTA here. 

She's just not feeling it and you were... and that's ok. It happens.

No need to waste anymore time on her. Take someone else."
b8b83g,"NTA. You fixed the internet issue yourself for your home. They can do the same. But it's pretty shitty of them to keep asking. Plus they don't ask you, they ask your girlfriend, I'm assuming so they can undermine you and get her to agree. "
b8b8ad,NAH. He'll be fine and you shouldn't risk your job over something like that. 
b8be3p,NTA- she should respect your wishes if you don’t want to be touched 
b8bhac,"ESH- your dad's joke is clearly in poor taste and I don't think it's funny. However, the more mature thing to do would be to sit down with him and have a conversation on why it is offensive. If he can't seem to understand the error of his ways and take you seriously, then he has some growing up to do as well. "
b8bkuh,"YTA

I’m shocked you have to even ask this actually, he goes with his friends to see movies you’re not interested in. Why can’t you do the same thing with this one? He doesn’t like horror movies even if it is a comedy so why would you expect him to want to go? Plus throwing a fit about it is pretty silly. "
b8blp6,"NAH. You’re trying to be a good friend but he doesn’t want you to pressure him. You meant well, but Tim has his own reasons for not wanting to ask her out. Just let him be and he will get over it. "
b8bpr8,"Wait, so the receptionist is upset that the CFO asked them to print some emails??

NTA. Far from you being an asshole, you're the kind soul coaching a subordinate on reality. What an odd thing to get upset about."
b8bq9y,[deleted]
b8bqw5,"NTA. Someone was being disrespectful and you told them to stop, but instead of owning up to it they just turned the tables ignoring the criticism.  "
b8bsm1,"NTA

Get what you want. It's your money. There's a world of difference between vanilla custard plus chocolate syrup versus chocolate custard. "
b8bvrr,"NAH

If you thank them for the offer and explain to them the reason why you can't eat their sugary treat, it's all good. "
b8bvso,"NTA

Hi there. I'm 48 years old. When I was 20, I did exactly what you are thinking of doing.

If I could give the 20-year-old me advice, this is exactly what I would say:

Skipping Pop's funeral haunts me terribly, and I feel horribly guilty to this day. Plus, my extended family (still) gives me shit about it 28 years later.

Work is very important. Opportunities for career advancement feel like they are few and fat between. Family is more important. Grandparents die only once.  Guilt is an awful sucker-punch to the gut. 

When you attend the funeral, you will have no way of knowing whether or not you were right to follow my advice. But when you skip the funeral, you will definitely know you were wrong. 


That is the advice I would tell myself if I could go back in time. You do you, of course.

I hope whichever choice you make works out well for you.

b8m7sg,"NAH

I do wanna say a few caveats. 

 One of my best mates has a brother he's essentially disowned. He didn't have to go into the details, but even knowing he was cool talking about this issue was a good bonding moment between us.

Realise you will be potentially missing out on this with your partner and there is the chance of a genuine wtf is going on moment of she does find out you have a brother and didn't tell her."
b8m95x,"Then YTA.  If it was just the stuff that was rotten, fine.  You threw all of the food out though.  Not cool at all!"
b8mefu,Absolutely. Just give me the tickets and go see your family. 
b8meyk,Watch her take him to court for child support still think she'd lose? Shes the only responsible and supporting parent she doesnt need to spend her money so he can see his kid too. He must not want to that badly if he doesnt chip in or save up the money to make it happen
b8mi4y,"NTA-

&#x200B;

It's a shitty situation, but as you said- there is another parent in the situation. Only difference being that it is actually their kid. Parent 2 needs to step up. Of course you want to help your sibling, but at the same time, you need to think of what's best for you and your wife as well as your child that is on the way."
b8mmmi,NAH. You have a right to worry and are entitled to your opinion. But don't give the man a hard time for doing the right thing. If it was your husband who crashed and some other pregnant lady's husband came to save him you would thank your lucky stars that people like him exist and aren't being held back by their worried wives.

Take her to a professional.  Years of emotional and physical abuse aren't going to just go away if she's treated well for a couple years.  "
b8ngkx,"YTA - As mainly this makes no sense. Why have both your parents but not both your kid's parents? Your progeny wasn't made by just you.

Also this seems like a terrible tattoo idea singularly. Why not the DOB of your parents in one place, and your kid (and possible future kids) in another if you really don't want your wife's DOB on there?

Or - just don't go for this tattoo. Seems like a terrible hill to die on."

I mean, it's Amazon. The drivers are probably overworked and underpaid, and dropping off all packages centrally is the only way to ensure they make their delivery route in time. Amazon on the other hand likely knows about this, but it's cheaper for them to compensate the few people who complain, instead of hiring more drivers.

You two have a contract between you, and Amazon is trying to get away with doing it as cheap as possible. You complain about it, and the compensate you. Business as usual."

You wouldn't have been the asshole if you would have taken her feelings into consideration and apologized right away instead of protecting that pride of yours."

Open marriages are tough.  If you aren't willing to be even a little considerate about if your husband is becoming unhappy with the situation, that's a bad omen for this working long term.  And isn't a good look for you.

You should have talked to him before hand and said that you know his schedule is unpredictable so he should be a player instead so it doesnt affect the group if he misses time. I think he has the right to be upset because finding out your friends aren't including you/making group descisions without you fucking sucks
b8ttnj,"NAH. It’s a seriously unfortunate situation, and you did right by trying to resolve it with them directly first

b8txf2,YTA.  Not even a card is cold. Sex isn’t a gift that’s something for both you and part of the relationship.  Dinner was also for you and $30 for her dinner if you’re making $75k a year is a bit cold. Even a small gesture of a nice card or a poem or a gift she’d like would have meant more.  Dinner and sex can be like any regular date night.  You even admit it’s because your cheap so no doubt she’s hurt.

b8u3fz,"NAH. I think your situation is a pretty normal case among children of Asian immigrants.

You know that college is not a linear investment, nor does it presuppose a single life trajectory. Career changes happen all the time because we get something vastly different from what we expect while in school. You did your time struggling through a miserable job. Are you truly ready to have a miserable career just to fulfill a ""debt"" to your parents?

Having your parents' blessing in a situation like this is really special. I think that's something that's worth taking with gratitude rather than doubt and self-resentment. It takes a lot of courage to be doing what you're doing, and so I hope you'll believe in yourself and chase after what you love."
b8u54i,"YTA. I don’t know or care about the details of your political disagreement and they are irrelevant.

Pranks are supposed to be things that a person would find funny afterwards.   Joking that you knocked up her best friend when she already had suspicions about the two of you having an affair wasn't a fucking prank - It was just cruel.

b8uenb,"NTA

If there was a real concern and your parents knowingly ignored it, then they'd be the assholes.  But the most you mention is that they shrugged when you asked them, that's pretty non-committal.  You didn't mention your school noticing anything or alerting your parents to an issue that they ignored.  Most parents don't double as psychiatrists and you were probably *their* normal.  Not everything requires an assignment of fault or anger.  A missed diagnosis may just be bad luck."
b8utox,"YTA but barely. You said you didn’t want to spend money but told a stripper you were looking to spend hundreds. You misled her about your intentions. Also, regardless of what she does during the time she’s not trying to earn money throughout her night, you wasted her time while she was trying to make money. That’s like saying you can waste a waitress’ time in a crowded restaurant because she just took a lunch break. Yeah you were wrong. You’re not a total asshole, but you clearly don’t understand strip clubs. Those women aren’t flirting with you for fun, if you waste their time you’re costing them money. "
b8uzpw,"NTA - Some people just like to hate on cyclists. But for these people cycling on the sidewalk will always make you the asshole no matter how considerately you go about it.

b8w35u,"NAH but I think you will learn a lot over the coming years running your business.  Having competitors is not a bad thing.  Yes, you want to win business from them, you want to be the best within your market, however having competitors is a big part of what will keep you on your toes when it comes to developing, growing, and innovating in your business.  There's nothing wrong with having a competitive outlook and wanting to win - but destroying them only really gets you a temporary win.  Using them to continually push your business to do better is probably going to be more valuable in the long run.  Depending on what kind of business this is, you may also find value in cultivating relationships with your competitors, joining local business/sector forums, collaborating on innovations etc. but that heavily depends on what your specific business does.  If it's a coffee shop, not so much.  If it's a specialist engineering business, potentially much."

It's nice that you're both trying to get healthy and lose weight together, but at the end of the day you're both adults entitled to make your own choices, and it's also possible to eat healthily and want to have a cheat day and indulge every now and then. It's your job to encourage and support her, not shame her. You don't own her and you don't get to control her or her diet. I don't care if you think your intentions are for her own good.

b8xd1e,"NTA.

You're mum isn't well and I have to say, you going to these appointments isn't making her better it's just enabling her and feeding into irrational concerns. She needs therapy. You are right, this is a waste of money and it's making her worse instead of better.

Furthermore, setting aside her wellbeing, forcing you to go to a doctor to settle her anxiety is just...disturbing. Very disturbing. It's like hypochondria by proxy. It's not unusual for particularly neurotic parents to fuss over their childs health but this is crossing a line."
b8xdsc,"YTA. Destroying other people’s property out of revenge is standard, basic assholishness. "

Are you also new to common courtesy? The correct course of action is to answer or return the company’s call and say, “Thank you for the offer, but I will no longer be pursuing this opportunity. I appreciate your time, and thank you for explaining the company and the position to me.”  In effect, don’t burn bridges. The job interview/search process is like dating. Wouldn’t you call a woman back to let her know you wouldn’t be able to go on a date with her?"

But deliberately inviting him to your flat knowing that it makes Amanda uncomfortable and upsets her is seriously immature and asshole behaviour. Amanda deserves to be comfortable and feel safe (physically and emotionally) in her own home. See Toby at other people's homes or public places. Don't be an inconsiderate dick and invite him to your flat. Sounds like she even asked you not to keep inviting him there and you straight out refused."

Honestly this is one of the few times in life where being a complete selfish asshole is much more justifiable (as long as you are not bridezilla). 

Can you have a small wedding ceremony with _just friends and no family_ if she wants something? Her wants for the wedding are just as important as yours. You don't want her family and she's fine with that but can you do something, even if small and use with an officiant and close friends?"

He’s the asshole if he continues to pester you about a trip you’ve told him you can’t afford. 

You’re the asshole if you tell him you think his parents have some responsibility to pay. 

Tell him one last time that you’d love to go, but you cannot afford it and him talking about it constantly and trying to persuade you to go when that’s just not possible is getting on your nerves. 

ETA: you’re not the asshole for wanting to go or wishing that they would offer to pay, as long as you realize that they don’t have any obligation to pay your way. "
b8z7fh,"NTA. That’s incredibly imposing of them- to bring all those dogs (some of which aren’t even theirs) to your (smallish) home. It’s your home, your rules. I wouldn’t be okay with it if it were me - I think you’re totally within your right to cancel. "

b8zla0,"NTA

the fact that he's trying to justify totalling your car by saying he did you a favour is all the evidence you need to see he's the asshole. He took your car, without a license, which he lost breaking the law, and ruined it (Which you really should not have agreed to). I'd say that's his financial issue to deal with. "
b8zobm,"NAH - But I would give him a heads up that you're doing it before you do so he doesn't feel like you've gone behind his back. He may honestly just be waiting for the right time to submit it. Just say something like ""Hey! Thank you again for you incredibly generous offer to link me up with the company - unfortunately I'm just staring down the barrel of needing to get a move on job hunting, so I'm just going to send my resume along to them this week, no pressure on your end."" Or something like that."
b8zq33,"YTA.

b8zt6d,"NAH  


She's not wrong to want to grieve and you're not wrong to not want a set time to relive tragedy every year.

An anniversary of a death doesn't have to be an explicitly sad thing, make it a celebration of his life."
b8ztai,"NTA. Tons of people do this. It’s a legitimate way to make money. I know for a fact that Goodwill Industries knows about people like you and like you. They consider you regulars. 

Edit to add: I just so happened to be looking at the IBISWorld Thrift Store industry report recently because I’m doing a project on Goodwill. This practice was discussed in the report as part of the lifecycle of thrift goods. Thrifting also promotes sustainability because it keeps things out of landfill and in use. "
b8ztcn,"NAH. I don't think it's controlling asking your partner to let you know when they'll be home. I often plan my day and dinner around my husbands work schedule and vice versa. We always let eachother know when we're running late. Personally I think it's common courtesy. 

But if it's something she's bad at, and forgetful about just try to keep in mind it's not intentional. And I agree with the other poster saying she should learn to manage her time better."
b8zu9u,"YTA and your comment about “entering into a contract” is laughable. 

You said yourself you took the whole sandwich that you agreed to share. You didn’t even ask. You just took it. You acted like a baby. "
b8zysc,"NTA. Paying for the honeymoon is supposed to be a wedding gift from your family. If the honeymoon is now free, they should use that money toward another gift."
b8zzan,"NAH - feelings are never wrong. It’s ok to miss your father and have conflicted feelings about your mom getting married again. I give you props for recognizing how you feel, but still planning on attending and supporting your mom. It’s ok. It’s ok to have mixed feelings.
Your mom will really appreciate you being there and it’s ok if you feel that way."
b8zzh6,"NTA, turning a room into a litter box is more than enough reason to kick someone out of your home. All the rest is gravy. "

I mean she never broke the agreement, and you haven't been an asshole about receiving the money at all. I mean sure it could be awkward but it's money you agreed upon, so just ask for it. I doubt she'd blow up at you over it, you agreed to it after all."
b9012u,"YTA to the bone. 

They are doing you a favor, in essence giving you their time when there is no practical need.

b932zq,"NTA for conveying your opinions. You fucked up by lying about it up to this point though. That's why she thinks you're ok with it.

b93inx,"Well I also hesitate to take this stance because biologically speaking you’re body wants to experience independence from your parents and in a lot of ways you’re entitled to that. From the perspective of a mother, I would say that she just wants to be in your life and read all the wonderful things people said about you. She wants to gush to her friends that your beautiful sketches weren’t even your final version. She loves you and sometimes love can be a bit smothering. I guess I think it’s worth it. Hard to see it at that age tho I think. For me anyway. "

b950a1,"This is sticky as fuck, so I'm going to go with NAH because I can see everyone's point of view.

James wants to not waste the money already spent on this trip. Since his gf is no longer an option, he is looking for the next best thing which is his closest friends, you and Megan (and his brother). Although it sucks that you are all in the same friend group as the ex gf (who has equal ""friend"" standing), I can't really blame him for inviting you, as you are his friends.

You are also correct in assuming Sarah will probably be hurt to see all of her friends go on a trip she was supposed to go on, with her ex. Sure, she has no say in what James does now that he is single, and she has absolutely no right to ask any of you not to go ""in solidarity"", but that will still be a sad situation to be in.

You are not an asshole for wanting to go. The trip, as you said, sounds fun, and it will be good times with friends. 

In the end, I think I would probably go, but also arrange for something fun to do with Sarah before/after. Since you are all in the same friend group, both James and Sarah have to come to terms with the rest of you hanging out without them all the time, until they can be civil and cool around one another."

I recommend a roundhouse kick."

Yes, the kids are being overly pushy, but what's the worst that could happen if you ask her?  She says no, maybe they're a little upset for a while, and then everybody just moves on with their lives."
b95jpl,"NTA. You don't *have* to get on with your parents. Honestly, it sounds like all his talk about you being ungrateful is just an attempt to manipulate you, which is a real dog move. I don't really know what your relationship is like, so I don't want to recommend cutting him out of your life completely (it seems like you get on when you're together). But you definitely don't need to see him for three whole weeks. You don't owe him that."
b95r8d,"NTA, she doesn’t have any right to your sperm,  Jesus. Plus all the other reasons you listed like you don’t want your sisters SO to have your kids, and have a child of yours raised by someone other than you, etc. She isn’t owed a family from you, she is the selfish one"

b95xtj,"NTA - he's being a jerk. But it's also dumb to play texting games like that. If you're into a person it's perfectly ok to text them back right away. If it seems like they're playing games/waiting to respond, they probably aren't worth your time."
b960c4,"NAH. It is valid for you to feel upset over this. It’s definitely an uncomfortable situation. That being said, your dad should get to move on. It’s weird that it’s your mother in law, but not wrong. "
b9613x,"NAH. Fasting is certainly safe if done smartly. But frankly - find something less all-or-nothing than going from binging to fasting. That is textbook disordered eating if ""you can't stop yourself"" when you are eating and your only way to stop is to not eat. Consider talking to a professional.

The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem, and ""I binge unless I fast for 5 days"" _is_ a problem.

Could it trigger her anorexia? Maybe, but frankly you are not approaching food in a healthy manner either. If you don't want to look like you are doing something similar to what she was doing (which it looks like you are) then choose something less extreme than 5 days of fasting at a time. That will benefit both you and her. 

Going to the gym while eating literally nothing is also not a great idea. You don't want to lose muscle but this is the road to doing so. "
b9637t,NTA especially if you can do this tactfully and he's not one of your superiors or execs at your work.  Thank you for taking one for the team. 
b9653w,"NAH

I'd maybe leave a note again with your info if it's bugging you, but if you don't hear anything just let it go.

There's a good chance they checked out the damage, realized it was minimal and didn't want to bother with it."
b968np,NAH.  Likely not much you could have done in 4 days.  But it might be worth reaching out to him now and letting him know you are thinking about him and support him in whatever he’s going through.  
b969w6,"NTA: The reason he didn’t tell you was he knew you would be unhappy and refuse to go. You are an adult at 20. Call the Uber and go home. 

I had a mother that tried this kind of stuff all of the time. Invite me to lunch an hour away and I’d walk in the restaurant and there sat the SIL I refused to associate with. She was counting on me not making a fuss in public. I didn’t, I told her I wasn’t playing, turned around, walked out and drove the hour home. She got the hint. Walk away or it will continue, no scene, no fussing, just, goodbye. 
"
b96a4p,"NTA. This isn't a hard math problem... the fact that he can't figure out why 50/50 isn't fair in this situation is mind boggling. I don't think sharing finances is necessarily a good idea based on what you said, but a percentage basis would be more fair.  Like 60/40.  Him asking for half your tax return is BS.  I assume he got the tax write off from the mortgage? Half of his return there should be yours as you paid half of the total household expenses. "
b96ad8,"NTA. They aren't your friends, so it's probably healthiest for you to move on."
b96ax3,"YTA for calling him names.

Also, did everyone know this was a real bet, where the money would actually exchange hands afterwards?  When I was in high school, my friends and I might bet a few dollars, but a $100 bet would be all talk, no payment after.  Any chance the kid you bet with didn't realize you'd expect payment?"
b96d8k,"NTA, your child must come first always. SHE did this."
b96g26,"NTA

If your girlfriend/other friends treat and respect you better, they should be the ones you think about first. If your sister isn't close, and thinks she's entitled to them just because she's your sister... she's not"
b96j9i,[removed]
b96kga,"NTA in any way. You need to set boundaries. Any chance of you moving out? Also, there's no reason to respect anyone because of their age. Only for their character. "
b96lcr,"NTA, You are entitled to your feelings on the situation. Also, this is a TERRIBLE work envrionment. Your GF is just giving her boss the reinforcement to say this to ANY female under his management. In nearly EVERY company there are VERY strict rules AGAINST this kind of behavior from someone in charge of others. He is most likely VERY blatantly violating his company's rules in this area. Not to mention...this can be considered sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment(there may be other women who find this kind of behavior to make them very uncomfortable.)  


The fact that your GF doesn't seem to care is really irrelevant in this situation. If ANYONE is TA here...it is your GF's boss.  


Not sure what you can do in this situation. You COULD search out the company and make an anonymous complaint, most companies have this as an option. But, not sure it would end up well for you.  


If your GF doesn't seem to mind that her boss makes inappropriate comments towards her or co-workers, perhaps this might not be a healthy relationship for you."
b96xhv,"NTA. If you truly believe that she produced an incorrect recount of what happened to further herself, and this damaged the employees' reputation, then it is entirely reasonable to call her out, just make sure you do it in an appropriate manner. Just make sure you are sure of what happened."
b96zh2,"NAH

Maybe a tiny bit of one, and you might have started a terrible arms race for the future, but fuck. This actually made me laugh. Thank you.

On the bright side, if you guys get into a fist fight the next morning, maybe you'll force them into taking appointments?"
b971jb,"NAH-

You’re just old fashioned. I do see where you are coming from, but as someone who works with kids 95% of kids have a device of sorts, even those who come from a lower socio economic status. 

I’d say that the parents of the sleepover would do best to have extra devices on hand. I’d be interested to see what they have planned for this sleep over! Call and ask how necessary the device would be, and if she has an extra your child can use. "
b97294,RUN. She was trying to see if you'd cheat. Plan and simple. You were catfished
b973mw,"NTA NTA NTA!!! 

I'm so sorry that the people around you, and who are supposed to be supporting you as you grow into  young woman, are being so shitty and hurtful. :( You don't deserve their insults, and you don't deserve to feel hurt by the way you look and how much you weigh, ESPECIALLY because you are still developing. Please consider reaching out to the professional counseling at your school for a realistic outlook on how you really are, and in how to manage your habits to combat eating disorders."
b974g9,"ESH - but I would say they suck more than you. You should have just apologized for your arguing back and being cranky in the car. They should have never let the silent treatment go on for so long and to such a great length. Someone needed to be the bigger person and try to hash things out, and that bigger person responsibility falls more on them because they are the parents. "
b9750t,NTA I’m kind of concerned about some of these behaviors with your husband. Not wanting the child to eat frequently or not enough so they wouldn’t poop 3 times a day? (They have small tummies this is normal for each meal) or try and starve them to get them to eat vegetables - in combination with trying to get them to eat less to be convenient? This is scary. Some kids just don’t get enough if they don’t have varied or frequent meals. Being underweight is not a desirable trait for a child. If they get sick or the flu and really can’t eat for a few days this puts their heath in even more danger. It sounds like he prioritizes what’s convenient for him and hopes you and the child cope with it. Your pediatrician should talk to him about encouraging your child to eat more instead and the risks of being underweight. It’s one thing if it’s just once in a while but kids need more than 1-2 meals a day. 
b9762l,"NTA

She might say no, and she has every right to say no without an explanation, but it's worth trying. 

I'd probably do what you did. 

You are kind of using her, but that is also exactly what networking is."
b976rg,NTA it seems like the teachers in this situation are the assholes. Pressuring a kid to share information they already no is sickening. It’s not your fault and I would of been pretty nervous in an empty room being questioned for 30 mins straight. 
b977w3,"NAH

As long as you're keeping her budget in mind, which means you might have to move to a cheaper place that is affordable for her.

I, personally, find a percentage split works better than a flat rate. Meaning we're both giving up the same percent of our income for living expenses. But that's just up to whatever everyone is comfortable with."

b97fdf,NTA Fuck Karen
b97fdz,"NTA-

You deserve your privacy, even if she does pay for the phone. 

Unfortunately she is the parent, and can eventually push the issue. It sucks, and she really shouldn’t do it, but some parents just don’t really respect their children’s privacy and feel entitled to access to things without any suspicion or necessity.

Better luck next time"
b97ifd,"NTA. Who wouldn't want their kid to take an opportunity at a better life. Like, what? Your dad's priorities are obviously very skewed, and it seems like you've done your due diligence with trying to maintain your relationship with him. This is a two-way street. He needs to step up to the plate, which it seems like he's failed to do your entire life. Go live your dream. You've done nothing wrong."
b97ijo,"NTA-

Have you confided in her that it bothers you? I think that it would be an easier route to just say “hey I love grabbing food with you but I’ve started to notice you mentioning what I eat and making a few comments, and I really do feel uncomfortable with it. Would you mind not making comments about my food anymore?” "
b97j4h,"YTA.   A funeral is not easy to plan.  First of all, it has to be on a weekend so people can attend, so they are limited to 2 days.   It isn't possible to wait an additional week for many families (if you want a viewing, storage fees, etc.).   If they do it in a church, it has to be scheduled around other functions of the church -- weddings, other funerals, regular service, etc.  It isn't like they have their pick of times!  Secondly, IT IS A BRIDAL SHOWER.   This is not an important event for anyone...least of all the groom.   I understand that in-laws are annoying, but this is not a time to be annoyed.   "
b97jtv,"NAH I get why you want to skip since you're doing extra training & it does kinda suck that the teacher won't allow you to do other PE stuff in class but unfortunately that's just how it is.

b97lvx,"NTA.

As you tell the story, it seems like a nornal panic response.

If I thought people are trying to break in I would contacted the police as well.

Instead of yelling ""let me in!"" he could said something like ""Good evening! Sorry to bother, my name is _______, I got locked out, can you please help me?""

Yelling ""let me in"" is not something that would inspire confidence in me to help this person.


My humble opinion, as always."
b97mrp,"NTA but kinda hesitantly. I see your point and  agree, but you are wording like an asshole. You won't get anywhere with that kind of talk

b97pc7,"NTA. Autism doesn't give him the right to be racist or rude, and you're not obligated to like anyone, whether or not they have a disability. This includes letting him join your group.

b97s6d,"ESH - by non profit hobby, my guess is this is probably some sort of performing arts as your description kind of fits.

It reads like he is kind of a big deal and probably an asshole, but you got involved with him for one reason or another. 

Now you want to use someone else to remove him from the activity so you can continue without his presence. 

The friend doesn’t want to be involved because she doesn’t want to be ostracized either.

You should probably find a way of dealing with the issue on your own."

b97u5s,"NTA, you should be able to have your own time alone, and your sister sounds entitled."
b97wzs,"YTA if you stay in the left lane when you're not passing anyone, and not preparing to turn left.

**Edit:** I'll add a bit of clarification here.  So the primary goal with driving (besides reaching your destination) is to keep the roads safe.  Generally-speaking, you can't control how other people drive, so you have to promote safety with your own driving.  This realization often leads to the mistaken conclusion of, ""If I go exactly the speed limit in the left lane, I can stop *others* from speeding, thus making the roads even safer than if I merely didn't speed myself.""

But that line of reasoning is flawed on many levels, the simplest of which is the fact that you won't stop someone from speeding if they want to speed;  you're just going to encourage them to pass you on your right (which is significantly more dangerous that being passed on your left), *and* to potentially do so more aggressively than they might have otherwise, since they're reacting to what they perceive as your attempt to force them to ""obey"" you. 

A predictable driver is a safe driver, and you're encouraging people to act unpredictably, and thus unsafely."

4 - even if your wife got pregnant now, it will be 5-6 years until they start school, which is lots of time for school programs to change.

Teasing him between you two is one thing but publicly making fun of his penis, especially when he has mentioned insecurity in locker rooms, etc., was not cool and kind of a betrayal.

It would have only been okay if you had inserted the word 'flaccid' and/or immediately after the jibe from his friend you defended him with ""Yeah but that's just because he's a grower not a show-er"" or ANYTHING that didn't emasculate him and prey on his insecurity.

Ask how Amy feels about the situation and if she wants to I would consider highly supervised visits  in a location you can control. 
b9agxz,"YTA it’s almost never a good idea to tell someone they’re overreacting. It’s just not. It’s dismissive, rude and shuts down conversation. 

On top of that, everyone left your mom out on a big decision. It’s no joke to put someone in a home. It’s a big decision and often requires ignoring the wishes of the person being put in the home. It’s a choice people make when they’re done caring for or can no longer care for someone and you’re mother deserved to have her say. It feels like they decided to do it without her because they wanted to steamroll the choice and keep your mother out of it. All of this is a good reason to feel betrayed. "

I hadn’t had my flu shot yet and wasn’t allowed into the hospital along with a few other older family members who didn’t have their whooping cough vaccine. We were all worried for their lives at that point and didn’t want to hurt our new family members anymore if even we really wanted to see them.

It wasn't cool to keep your now-girlfriend on the hook while you were away, constantly texting her while you were sleeping with other girls. You were sending mixed messages and I can see how she would feel like you were leading her on.

What are you fighting about now when your girlfriend brings up this past misbehavior? Are you giving her reason to doubt your fidelity now, or does she bring it up in response to completely unrelated issues? "
b9c3rv,"YTA. You were reminded multiple times to grab your paperwork and didn’t. Since your permit is so important to you, your mom is right to use this to teach you a lesson in responsibility. Not getting your permit the day you wanted to will surely be something not easily forgotten. "

b9cc0y,"NTA, but as they do have kids together I can see why your husband doesn't mind (or at least mind less) giving her money. You should trust his judgment that he is making financially sound decisions for the ex as well as for your family. In terms of the rent, if all you're worried about that the money wouldn't truly be used for rent, a compromise could be a check written to the landlord. That way ex can't complain that the ex(your husband) isn't helping out.   
ofc ex is TA for always asking for money but if your husband really still wants to help out, this could be an option. "

b9cxcc,"ESH. Probably not what you wanted to hear. Let me get this out of the way first though: your mom should not have screamed that at you. That was completely uncalled for and highly innapproriate. That is the kind of thing that haunts people years after they move out. As a parent, one needs to keep a cool head and not blow up over some inevitable rebellion. So they are wrong for that.

However, you have it wrong. You don't have the power to ask your parents to do your chores for you. That's like being a secretary and asking your boss to make his own copies. On the surface, it's no big deal, but you were given this job and you need to do it.

It can suck, having to do chores. It feels like you're cleaning up after everyone when all you should worry about is cleaning up after yourself. But as someone who moved out less than a year ago, let me tell you that cleaning up after yourself is way harder than you think. Maybe you have to clean everyone's dishes, and perhaps a few other chores, but your parents (and perhaps siblings?) Have to do everything else you don't do, even the stuff you don't notice. Bathroom cleaning, shower scrubbing, laundry, cooking food, grocery shopping, vacuuming, sweeping, dusting, disinfecting, tidying, yard work, paying SO MANY bills (trash, water, power, car insurance, house insurance, morgage, food, subscriptions, etc.) on top of working 8 hours a day, five days a week in order to pay for all of it.

If you want to renegotiate the terms of your responsibilities, then try to have a respectful conversation. But no matter what your chores are, be it one or several, YOU have to do it. It's YOUR job. So just do it, okay?"

I wouldn't say that ESH, because your girlfriend is very entitled to her annoyance with you for what you did.

What you have to understand that is if you're making a request, then the other person has the right to refuse. At that point the ball is in your court in terms of leaving or staying. The answer to that question is dependent on how important the tattoo is to you.

Covering up the tattoo isn't going to change what he did in the past, so before you ask - you should really take a minute and honestly answer the question ""will this give me closure?"" You could just as easily see the new covered-up tattoo as a reminder of the infidelity. The cover up will need to be even bigger than the original, that's just the nature of cover up tattoos.

He did say at first that he didn’t mind but it was under the influence of alcohol. But just because you’re under the influence doesn’t make it right to make out with his girlfriend, his girlfriend is an ass for offering and you’re an ass for accepting it, knowing that your friend was also drinking. Drinking doesn’t make things excusable. "

And even if you weren't pregnant, they're being shitty and entitled."
b9h8xb,"YTA. 

1) You're victim blaming.

2) You have no idea how hard it is to shake someone like this. There's a good chance even if she told this guy to fuck off, he wouldn't.

3) It's hard when you're in the moment in a social setting to know what the appropriate response is to someone like this, to get them to leave you alone.

4) People often judge your reasonable actions when getting a creep to stop as socially unacceptable, aka more victim blaming.

5) Women are always afraid that creepy fucks like this will murder them if they reject them outright or harshly. As a man, you likely have never thought about this.

b9ht0x,"NTA.  Casually dropping that information like that was kinda heartless of your mother.  She definitely should have told you as soon as they made that decision.

Shouting at you for ""being petty"" was heartless too.  I don't mean to sound condescending, but you're 13.  You're at an age where emotions are more difficult to control, and honestly, I know some adults that probably would have acted similarly.

Just be careful about the battles you choose here.  You're going to be with your parents for at least five more years, so it's probably not a good idea to hold a grudge about this.  Give it some time and maybe the situation will change, and they'll be more open to getting a dog."

It would be NICE if you could offer to leave a few items till she's ready to move out as well (the desk in her room for example) but not mandatory.   You DO need to warn her in advance of your intentions so she has enough time to make plans (or not) to cope with the situation.

This comment alone is all of the justification you need to no longer talk to her about this topic. It's clear she has no idea what being bisexual means or even what sexuality is. 

Maybe with time she'll get used to it and accept it, but for now, as long as she isn't causing problems over your sexuality, it's perfectly fine to leave that topic alone and completely understandable that you wouldn't want to talk about it, given their initial reactions.
"
b9jee2,"NTA. That being said, I would tread lightly with complaining to the parents directly if you don't know them well. They may perceive it as an attack on them or their children.

A) Stop invalidating her opinions

B) Stop acting like you are the depository of all knowledge, ie a know-it-all

C) Stop lecturing her 

>My girlfriend didn't like the sound of that and told me she couldn't believe I was making her out to be a mental case

D) its ok to not be perfect. 


You want her to be content with her less than perfect appearance but you are incapable of being content with her less than perfect mental health.

Don't be disrespectful to your friends or family when they're trying to help. There's a better way to communicate and it's not shutting down the way you are. "
b9k52i,"NAH. This seems kind of silly to argue about. She has her opinion (which harms no one) and you have your opinion (which harms no one). If you two constantly bump heads over inconsequential shit, then it may be best to end the friendship. Neither of you are necessarily wrong. Opinions surrounding jealousy and other emotions are usually formed by personal experience, culture, etc., so to argue about something like that when it's harmless to both parties is kind of petty.

Saw that you still live with her, and OP, I feel for you so hard. I hope that when you turn 18/move away, you cut all ties. Sister/family member or not, she is very likely one of the biggest stressors in your life rn and needs to be cut loose. "

b9let3,"NTA. You can tell her how you feel, especially since there's a child involved who is going to get FUCKED UP by this decision, especially if they end up splitting. Just don't expect her to listen to you. If she's blinded, your words might not be enough to knock her out of it. It will just make her dislike you. You have some valid concerns, so just try to express your opinions logically.

I can see both sides to this

Your point of view:

Your wife's family is excluding you on an event that you should be invited to. You feel left out in a way and you wonder what is going on. I can totally understand this. 

Family's point of view:

They want to have some time with your wife and maybe relate back to older times when it was just them. I can see where they're coming from. (I'm assuming of course)

So if I were you, I would just let it go and possible apologize and try to see where they are coming from since her brother is furious. It just seems like a misunderstanding to me.

Instead, you gave her something she literally cannot use right now and very likely will not be able to use before it expires. Your intentions may have been good. But you clearly didn't think and you're also clearly not super sympathetic to the situation.

From the context of your story Alex was defending the guy because he was a dude... Refusing to see how weird it is to not only ask to share a cigarette with a stranger but *insist* on it after being offered you own is just his way of being like woman=bad person, guy=auto acceptable no matter what. 

Plus the guy could actually have had herpes that he transmitted by sharing the cigarette; it was a joke that was also not really a joke because it's true!

Kids dont solve problems. They create them. If your foundation isnt strong enough, it will crumble. If either party isn't 100% on board...a child can wreck even the most perfect of relationships. That said, kids are incredible, and the single greatest gift I've ever been lucky enough to recieve. Despite their faults.

Your wife needs to realize as much as she wants another child,  if the time isnt right....its not right. You need to be patient,  kind, and understanding with your wife. Kids are a dealbreaker for a lot of people. Listen to each other and be there for each other.

To me it sounds like your friend is just going through the growing pains of being a teen. Maybe it was a bit insensitive to tell him to get over it after you snapped, but good friends are supposed to tell each other what needs to be said.

I've had this same discussion with my husband. Do you have kids? I love the people up there making it about your ""standard of living,"" but if he's your family's main source of income, it's absolutely irresponsible to jeopardize that needlessly. Life insurance will never buy your children a father, and a two-parent home isn't an unreasonable lifestyle expectation.

Yes, people die in unexpected ways everyday, but you're not supposed to *set yourself up for it* when people depend on you. It's not selfish to expect him to hold up his end of the bargain (in our case, I do all the shitty, unpaid aspects of raising children and managing a household and work 10-15 hours a week for a little extra cash. I sacrificed a good career for our family. He's got to work and bring home the bacon, and he has to love with the reality that we depend on him almost completely for income. It's what we agreed on.)

In the end, we agreed that once all the children were launched properly and he'd only be leaving ME to my own resources, he's free to pursue risky things like motorcycles.

It's not about ""selfish"" or ""lifestyle,"" *it's about honoring his agreement* to provide for us if I relinquish my career path so he could freely pursue his career without the constant interruption of the children's needs."

Edit: Some of y'all are getting on my case because I said sexual assault instead of rape. I chose this because sexual assault is a term which encompasses all nonconsensual sexual activity. I do not know the specifics of what happened to OP, but I know enough to know that he didn't want it and couldn't consent to it. So I chose a broader term to indicate his inability to agree to sexual activity.

Sexual assault is broadly defined as forcing another person to engage in unwanted sexual acts with you. It encompasses anything and everything."

It's clear you WANT this to be NTA, but the fact of the matter is you're getting something you did not earn. You're probably thinking ""but there's no cost to anyone else"". False. The rest of the class gets their fair grade while you get a skewed grade based on an honest mistake.

It doesn't matter that she's a bad teacher or that you're normally a good student. Life is unfair and you're gonna get a lot more of these situations in university and your future career. Just because life is unfair doesn't mean you should play unfair. An honest man would tell the teacher and get their honest mark. 

I'm also gonna tell you that your grade 9 science mark is gonna have absolutely zero bearing on your life. Universities look at your upper years of high school mainly. You seem like a kid thats driven and motivated to succeed. That's good, keep up the good work, but keep it honest in the process.

EDIT AGAIN: You might be immune to her bull but a growing child won't be. If someone is willing to exclude you from your baby's scan for petty reasons, threaten that you will find out the sex of your baby on Facebook if you are not in a specified place at a specified time, she could be willing to use that child as a weapon in the future. Book in for some counseling and address the issues you have before the baby gets here."

Your ""friend"" that has the crush on you needs to grow up.  Throwing a temper tantrum because his crush didn't return his feelings is just ridiculous and reeks of nice guy syndrome (y'know the whole ""BUT I'M A NICE GUY - WHY WON'T YOU JUST GIVE ME A SHOT??

how is your sister driving your family into debt because of her white guilt because she is going to pay the money back herself later in life to the tribe to make good on it. something that is pretty respectable imo.

Being a friend means telling your friends they might not want to heat even if it risks losing that friend. And your male friend needs to know what he is doing is creepy, manipulative and is in no way going to get your female friend to like him back. He needs to be told to move on and not make these very public post about her again. No one is entitled to like someone back just because they like them. In all honestly if I was you, I would cut ties with the creep. But I do see the value in staying in his life to hold him accountable for his own actions. 

Mel had every right to know what he was posting. You do hold some accountability for introducing them. So I think your loyalty should be with Mel. What he is doing is very obessive and concerning. She needs to be able to protect herself from him in case he tries to escalate things outside of social media and knowing about these post could help her file a police report later."

Do....do you honestly think that by restricting their access at home rather than teaching them healthy habits that they won't ever be exposed elsewhere?

Do you think their friends won't ever talk about the newest movie or tv show - or video game that was just released? That your kids won't go hog-shit crazy indulging in these things when they finally do have access because, rather than teaching them healthy habits, you thought it better to just take it out of the equation altogether?

Look, at the end of the day, these are your kids and it's your choice in how you want to parent them - but you can't shield them from these things forever.  

Personally, I think you'd be better off teaching them healthy habits rather than pretending like these ""addictive, mind-poisoning"" things don't exist at all."
b9zmsb,"NTA

I’m sorry but there’s a difference between fangirling a little over someone to your boyfriend and being completely obsessed with someone. She is obsessed with this dude to the point where if you were sick in the hospital she’d still go to the concert. I don’t blame you for calling her out for this because at first, you went along with it, until she started getting really creepy about it. Yes, she is still young, but even as a younger person, I’m not that obsessed with a superstar to the point I would leave my boyfriend in the hospital to go see his concert."

I’m not sure if she’s invited multiple or just you but you don’t have to go and she’s being immature and unrealistic. 
b9zrc4,NTA - you know you’re not the asshole...  but you are the fool if you think for even a second that you can believe him
b9zv4d,"YTA . 

Read this back from your girlfriend’s perspective - whether you did or not, of course she thinks you faked it to go out with your buddies. You’re too sick to go to meet her family but within an hour, after she’s gone, you are surrounded by friends and heading out into the desert to hang with them. 

All without keeping her in the loop. You probably could have solved this with a phone call to her as soon as you felt well. If you’ve got a transparent relationship of course this is going to sting for her a bit. 

And also then when you begrudgingly arrive you sulk and insult her family. That’s not great. 

It’s not the worst thing you could have done by far, but yeah you messed up. "
b9zxxj,"YTA

Your fiance is correct - the right way to block your MoH's son is to not allow children period. Expect that some people may be upset at that too, or unable to attend.

Does MoH have a plan for who will care for the son during the ceremony and reception? At least one and preferably more adult family members (father, grandparent, aunt/uncle) can work out who will have the son at what times during the events. They should prepare him to keep calm (stim toys, ear plugs, weight blanket, whatever his comfort items are!) and be ready to take him out of the room when he's showing signs of approaching meltdown, not waiting for it to happen."
b9zydr,"NTA, sounds like she's gotten too comfortable with you taking care of the kids in the morning. I'm sure she's not an asshole but maybe remind her that you are usually the one to do this and you just would like to have one morning to work out with your buddy (which it seems like you have been trying to set up for a while)."

At the same time, it doesn’t seem malicious on her end. More like binge-drinking is a problem for her. It’s tough to talk about, but it could be worth expressing your concerns to her in a non-controlling way. Based on this post, it’s impacting your relationship. That’s not a good sign."

ba0vxk,"Tentative NAH

I'll give your friend the benefit of the doubt that he **was** interested, but it just fizzled out before he got the chance to give it a try. 

I also think it's pretty reasonable that you'd want the stuff back, given that he seemingly did nothing with any of it, and you'd still be able to make use of it. 

Although I think either of you or both of you could easily become an asshole as the situation develops. 

For example, if he accidentally lost them and you blow up at him over it. 

Or if he admits he was never really that interested and sold them all.

So maybe try to tread carefully. "

I’m glad your manager is siding with you, and it honestly sounds like this guy isn’t a great asset to the team if he started drama this quickly in his time there. If he felt you were hitting on him he could’ve approached it with you in private letting you know he had a girlfriend, or just given it time to realize that’s just how you act with everyone. "

That being said...  maybe the things she's interested in just aren't obvious to you? I'm really into writing, and video games (beyond just playing them) but from the outside I probably look like a lazy asshole addicted to electronics.

Also she's a kid.. sometimes they're just not into much.

Did she use to be interested in something and then quit? Has she gotten increasingly withdrawn, or sullen? Does she not hang out with anyone?

If so... maybe look into her experiencing some [depression.](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/depression/parents-guide-to-teen-depression.htm/)

ba9cc7,"YTA. Let's break it down:

>Last night we were at a bar celebrating this girls birthday party but also kind of celebrating my girlfriends huge achievement. Long story short, she started posting on Instagram and Snapchat right next to me about how she’ll be living in Europe in a few months and will meet one of her friends in Paris. 

IT's all about you, right? She couldn't possibly just be posting about something she likes! It's about you. That is insufferable. Your girlfriend is happy. Her social media posts about her well-earned accomplishment is not ""flaunting"" anything except what she has accomplished.

>I didn’t say anything but having her flaunt that in my face when she knows it’s a sensitive subject brought down my mood and made me shut down. She then went to the bathroom so I got on my phone for a little bit and was still on it when she came back because I was reading something. Admittedly, I didn’t really feel like talking at that moment and the phone was my escape but I couldn’t have been on there for more then 5 minutes after she came back.

So you're out at somebody's birthday, and somebody else's celebration party, and you're so upset and self-centered that you decide to take the most obvious, sulking, pitiful road and just shut down in the middle of it all? You do realize that everybody can see you when you get like that, right? It's not a cute look, and it's not something worth empathy.

>She then told me I looked miserable and to go home if I was having such a bad time. I told her I wasn’t having a bad time and I was here for her. 

Except that you were not! You aren't even happy for her, you're just upset how it will be a minor inconvenience for you. If you were there for her, you would have taken the out she had given you and left. Instead, you proceed to escalate, escalate, escalate, and mope, mope, mope.

>I questioned why she was upset 

gee I wonder. That can't have been a serious question. It honestly sounds like you were trying to get her to say *something*, *anything* that you could use to flip this whole episode back on her

>and she kept telling me to just go home because I looked miserable but I said no. 

So, repeatedly you moped and moped, even after many opportunities to leave with some dignity.

>She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as I followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling me to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to me saying “BABE” implying she wanted me to follow her and get in the car but I just said “No, I’m not going with you” so she gave me the middle finger and took off. 

Or she was pissed you kept following her, didn't know how to respond when you did, and it ended in a stupid mess. I'd have flipped you off, too.

>That last bit made me upset and I texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn’t some game where she runs away and I immediately go chasing after her. She said I looked miserable when I was on my phone and humiliated her because I couldn’t even hold a conversation. 

She's right. How you acted was humiliating.

>Today we talked about it more and she says that she’s incredibly hurt because it’s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around me. She says my excitement for her isn’t genuine and that I say all the right things but don’t mean them. 

So she told you this and you're still justifying yourself? What did you even post for if you heard THIS and you didn't see that you're being an asshole?

>She says she understands that I’m sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure I felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration we would start having those conversations about how she’s feeling. In response I said, “If it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we’ve really talked about it. I’d know that something this big is obviously a good thing but it affects you too as my girlfriend so I’d try to be aware of your feelings.”

Well, then you're very selfish. If other people's accomplishments make you feel bad, then maybe you should be working on getting some for yourself instead of dragging down the person you supposedly love most in the world. Being happy is not ""flaunting it in your face,"" you self-centered ass, it is being happy. It says a lot about you that you can't bare to see your girlfriend happy about receiving a prestigious scholarship.

Edit: Not to mention that somebody's birthday party/celebration party isn't the place to be trying to get some concessions from your girlfriend. You weren't even looking for a solution, you were just upset and put a huge damper on the celebration. Why couldn't this have happened before the party, or after? There is literally no reason for you to have done this."

I think really the issue comes from how people from different backgrounds define feminist. A lot of people from conservative backgrounds are super uncomfortable with the term. But when you bring up basic feminist principles like wanting men and women to be paid equally for equal work, they're all for it. They just associate the term with badly made strawman arguments from conservative talk shows and Breitbart. These places deliberately go out of the way to find the craziest extremists possible and record them saying outrageous things, like ""kill all the cis white men"" etc. When you grow up with stuff like that playing in your head, of course you're going to have a skewed view of feminism.

Someone from a more liberal background would have very different connotations of the word feminist, associating them with women's rights, suffrage, civil rights, etc. In those cases, feminism would be a core tenet and a part of their identity. Something to be proud of, that was always associated with positivity.

I don't think you're wrong for asking her to define feminism. I also think the reason she got offended was because by asking her to define it, you showed that you at least partially subscribed to the conservative view that feminists are obnoxious twits who blow tiny issues into large ones and seek to oppress men rather than help women. In reality, that's a pretty tiny subset of the population.

I can see why you'd ask that, and I can see why she would be offended by it. NAH I don't think either of you did anything super wrong. Sometimes things fall out like that."

> He even told me that he waited to tell me because he knew I would be pissed.

But he didn't know you'd be pissed *prior* to telling them they could stay? Bullshit. Inviting them over without realizing what a shitty situation he was putting you in is mere asshole territory. The fact that he *knew* you wouldn't be okay with it and did it anyway is a total violation of your boundaries. That is a *major* asshole move, and you need to have a serious conversation about this as soon as his parents are gone. And you're doing a lot more than you're obligated to by going *way* out of your way to be nice to his parents and avoid waking them up."
baafcy,"NTA. My answer was YTA until I read that you’re watching your kid all the time. Last I checked, he helped create her and not that truck. I think you have every right to sit him down and ask him to share the responsibilities of parenthood more. You are a person too. "

Has your father given any thought to how traumatising a ""not guilty"" verdict would be for you?

You are not the aggressor, you are not the criminal. Your only responsibility is to do what is best for *you* to be able to heal. 

If your abuser hurts someone else, that is on him and only him, not you. You cannot control his actions, only he can. "

Your mum lost valuable earning years supporting your father, as an investment in their combined financial future security. Your dad then ripped that future away from her. Alimony is partially to cover the funds she misses out on her entire life because she wasn’t working on a career in those early years. 

Think of it as if your dads career was a business- she helped front the start up costs, then as soon as the business started making profit your dad brought in a new co-business owner and cut your Mum out. If she had invested in herself she would have a secure income stream, but because she invested in your dad, she lost that. So alimony is like her having stocks and regularly getting dividends from her investment in your dad. You don’t ask business men (or women) to refuse their earnings from stocks just because they’re involved in another business. She made that initial investment, she’s entitled to that money. 

Just because another income earner is in the picture, doesn’t mean she doesn’t deserve alimony. It’s a wise financial decision on her part to wait until the alimony expires, and not tacky at all. What was tacky was your dad cheating on her. "
baaofw,"NAH: if he doesn’t want to switch the classes he doesn’t have to, but if his schedule doesn’t align with yours he shouldn’t expect you to drive him an hour before you have to go in. If he says no to changing classes and is upset with you not driving him then he is an asshole. He needs to figure out a way to get home or school by himself if he doesn’t want to try to make the schedules more convenient. "

You’ve made it clear you don’t care if you share stuff, just that she asks and that doesn’t make you an asshole. She’s an asshole for ignoring your requests and just continuing to do whatever she wants. It’s your room and your house as much as it’s hers. You’re entitled to your privacy. Try talking to her about this and if she still continues try getting a lock for your door, but definitely talk to her first. Make it clear it makes you uncomfortable and that she’s invading your privacy. She’s being a ridiculous asshole for no reason. Good luck hope you guys can work this out "

I don’t blame him for being mad, you did lie to him and it’s just not good for friends to lie to each other but you didn’t do it to hurt him. Ultimately I don’t think either of you are assholes but you should talk to him about how you can improve the piece instead of asking for his opinion. He probably doesn’t want to shit on your work and won’t list the problems but would help you make it better. Just try talking to him "

I think you're mad/resentful that he adopted two dogs you did not want and do not like. But since you gave in (and therefore can't be too mad this was 'forced upon you'), this minor thing is getting to you a lot more than it should. Not only that, but it's a valid and new reason to be able to vent your frustrations about the dogs.

It sucks, and your husband was really selfish to push this on you, even if you did say yes. But, being that you did, you need to find a way to live with it without it eating you up. It's done now and it's not going to help you in anyway if every time the dogs do something mildly annoying it sends you into a rage. "

bacpd6,"NTA. Long distance relationships are tough. They need to have an ending point in sight where you can be together in a way that makes you both happy. Simply put, his version of that end point doesn’t make you happy. You are 22, he is 24. You have a career near the big city. He is still deliberating about police training. Your lives may be turning separate directions. You can still love one another, but compromise is what’s necessary in this situation- and it sounds like your boyfriend isn’t willing to consider the big city even though it’s common to live safely in a city. Plus, your boyfriend wants to be a cop. Wouldn’t he want to experience different communities to prepare for a career in public service? 

You are allowed to draw lines in the sand. I think you should discuss with your boyfriend about your plans for moving in together and work towards a compromise. Otherwise, the end point may not happen. "
bacpol,"NTA

bacpzr,"NAH. I can see why she would be upset, you basically said “I don’t trust you enough to tell you.” At the end of the day it’s your birthday and you deserve to spend it how you like.

bae5p9,[removed]
bae8bj,"NAH but I would reconsider your stance. I’ve been out of high school for a fair amount of time now, but basically everyone had a smartphone. I didn’t get one until I think 9th or 10th grade, purely because I was sentimentally attached to my old flip phone. But it did make it hard to socialize sometimes. Kids these days are using Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok. Those are all apps. So by not having a smartphone they’re getting left out of a lot of social opportunities that others their age have access to. Unlimited minutes means nothing because almost no one does phone  calls these days. Even texting is getting pretty unpopular.

 I also remember the kind of general assumption by teachers that everyone had a smart phone. We wouldn’t use our phones often in class because they were normally not allowed, but every so often, a teacher would say, “alright, pull out your phones!” And if you didn’t have a phone for whatever reason then you had to awkwardly look on with someone else for whatever the activity was. And I’m sure that’s become even more common in the past few years since I graduated. "

How aware is she of her issues? Does she know she's gross but doesn't feel like it matters, or does she wonder why people dislike her? Until 7th I had no idea that people thought I ate fast, or that my bra was doing weird things to my figure, or that other people could smell that smell, or that they didn't think girls should be making the types of jokes boys make. 

If you talk to her about it, try to remember the way you would like to be spoken to, if someone was telling you that you were fundamentally gross. Hopeful language, roughly equal amounts of positive and negative feedback, trying really hard not to talk down to her like she's some kind of idiot.

And if she doesn't get it still, like you talk to her and she goes ""so? I don't care what they think "" (which sounds crazy, but some people really just don't care) it might be time to GENTLY explain to her why it is embarrassing for you to be around her when she's like that. "
baehf8,"Considering this is a vacation and not a nowhere-else-to-go per your comment, NTA.

It sounds like his brother is both overstaying his welcome and disrespecting your space. You don't leave empty beer cans all over the place when you're visiting someone. I also think it's 100% reasonable to want some breathing room! Asking for a time limit on visits is totally OK; it's not like you're banning him from the house.

Hostel dorm beds are dirt cheap, too, and a lot of hostels are actually pretty nice -- no-frills compared to a hotel, but more than adequate for a few nights. I stay in them all the time when I travel. :) The brother could absolutely get a bed for a few nights there."

I knew my grandad, he picked me up from school every week, but we weren't by any means best friends. When I turned up at the hospital when he had days left, he cried.

I'd start off the conversation about his drinking (especially since it's scaring both you, your mom, and your little sister). Also, working 20 hours or so bagging groceries isn't going to provide for your family, so I'd be worried that he's mooching off your mom.

bai01h,YTA. Its a fucking game dude and she's absolutely right in that you have no excuse to have less patience with her when she's your girlfriend.

baiavi,"NTA. But -

No one will do anything about dogs that don't get walked and have fleas. As long as they're fed and have water, her dogs will remain with her. That is the unfortunate truth.

If you want to help -

First, there are flea shampoos. If you're OK with it, you can buy a bottle for $5-10 and give them a bath. If the coworker truly ""doesn't know what's wrong with them,"" maybe she actually just needs an answer. Some people are really, really poor pet owners, even if they technically ""love"" their pets.

In terms of helping her, approach it from the perspective of, ""I noticed that when we did X, the dogs seemed to love it, I think it's a great idea to do that going forward,"" as opposed to, ""your dogs are neglected and you're a shitty person, you should do something about it."" Even if the latter is correct, no one will take her dogs away from her based on your description, so it'll just make her defensive.

Little dogs should have harnesses rather than collars for walking. One, they can get out of leashes (and should be able to get out of their collars in case they get trapped in a bush or something). Two, their necks can be fragile.

All dogs need exercise. Coworker has two kids, it's a bonding experience for them, too. Even a quick walk is a good thing. It's possible that she genuinely doesn't believe they need a walk--some people are dense (we have a yard!)

The barking is a different issue. They could be barking at her home because they're protecting her home, whereas you're still a stranger and they know it's not theirs. Or because they're under-exercised and under-stimulated. It's hard to tell just based on this.

Lastly, if you think she's good for it, you could take them to the vet and have her reimburse you. ""Hey I know you're busy, I don't mind."" Assuming you don't mind.

It is an unfortunate reality that people don't provide appropriate care to their pets, and an unfortunate reality that animal control won't do anything about it unless the animals are being explicitly abused (no food or water, or physical abuse). Unless you convince the woman to give the dogs up, the best you can do to help them, is help them and nudge her toward better habits, in case she really is that clueless. "

baigi6,"ESH.

Who the hell are you to decide how necessary someone's service animal is?

That said, she shouldn't be letting her dog piss all over a grocery store. You both suck imo

&#x200B;

Edit: I've had a couple of people say that service animals are trained not to pee in public -- I hear that, and you're right. But we can't say off of this *one time* that the dog peed that the dog isn't a service animal at all. We're all potty trained, but I'm willing to bet we've all had close calls in our adult lives where we only just made it to the bathroom in time. Same deal with this dog. And the woman's reaction to it (confusion, then surprise, then *immediately cleaning it up*) makes me think that this is NOT something the dog does regularly. She should have kept a better eye on her pup so that he didn't need to go in the grocery store, but OP is definitely in the wrong for yelling at her about it.

Also, I know that a lot of people have ""service dogs"" that don't actually need them. I know. We *don't* know that this woman is one of them."

You are forcing your wife to deal with your parents instead of dealing with it yourself. Because of your parents' opinions one of you will have to not enjoy the conversation, her if she has to make shit up, or you if you tell them that's now how you do it in your relationship. So, who's responsibility should it be to have the annoying part of the conversation with YOUR parents??? It should be your responsibility every time. "
bainkj,YTA -100%. imagine you having the courage to ask out your crush and she doesn't even decline or give a reason but just ignores it. imagine that and then this girl avoids you in school and finally when she could give an explanation she just stays quiet and acts like nothing happened.

baj77y,"NTA - but to be honest after reading your comments and post, it sounds like there's a lot of layers here. Mother's, some of us carry and birth our children but we don't all do it the same way. If, after 6 weeks, you feel ready to go back you should feel free to do so. And you should enlist as much help as needed, it takes a village and you can never have too many people around to help care for your child when you can't. That being said, the first 6 weeks are really tough with a newborn and can definitely make you hate being at home (the damn hormones), I would talk to a counselor to help you figure out your feelings. But it really is totally okay for you to feel like being at home is not for you. Good luck!"

bajlo3,"YTA for not even trying to respect your roommate or find a compromise.

It's not unreasonable for him to expect to go to bed in the evening and get a good night's sleep.  You're the one keeping late, non-standard hours.  

Do you really have to put your books away at 1am?  How much time do you really need to get ready for bed?  Can you use the light from your phone screen to navigate to your bed without bumping into things?  Can you open and close the door slowly and gently so it doesn't make as much noise?  There are so many ways you could try not to disturb him when you come in, but you're saying you can't be bothered to try.

It's irrelevant that lights don't wake you up, they wake him up and he's communicated clearly that it's a problem.  Telling him he has sleep issues he needs to address when his issue is that you are coming in late and loudly, which he's trying to address and you're ignoring him,  is complete YTA territory.  Your social life choices that keep you out late are your problem, quit making them your roommate's"
bajmd7,"Nta

I'm sure that this is how you build resentment in a relationship. Her thinking is self absorbed and entitled. Cold day in hell before I handed that cash over. I dont think this is unreasonable. If she thinks it is and you're flabbergasted over there, maybe a good time to talk about things before spending that on a wedding too. Good luck."
bajndv,"YTA. Friendship is not a consolation prize. You've been friends this entire time with the sole intention of being together some day. You girlfriendzoned her. You lead her on to believe you were genuinely her friend and someone who cared about her. You're effectively telling her she's worthless to you unless she is your object of affection/sex. She dodged a bullet.

Edit: OP, if you really wanted to be ""honest"" with her, you should have told her you wanted to date her before you wasted all of her time. You're the asshole x1000000

Could you have maintained your professionalism to the end and not brought up the harassment to his face? Sure. 

However, you didn't insult him or demean him in any way. You simply parroted something that he'd already said. He embarrassed himself. You just let that factoid slip to the woman he was with.

bak1gr,"NAH....yeah, she didn’t communicate properly, but she’s obviously frustrated. She’s dealing with an enormous amount of guilt right now. She wants to feel like that super mom, but deep down she knows she isn’t enjoying it like she thinks other moms do. If I were you, I’d wait until emotions have calmed down a bit and when baby is asleep, have a talk with her. As someone who has kind of been in this situation,  a good alternative that might not make her feel as bad, is to consider part-time work for now. Maybe just a day or two a week...to see how she feels. If she hates it, then she quits and no harm, no foul. She may find it’s exactly what she needs to recharge her soul with adult interaction. 
I know she snapped at you, but try and be emotionally supportive (it sounds like you have the physical support down pat!). She may even still be dealing with some post-partum depression."

She's lost interest in going to school despite previously being a good student. She's started to isolate herself from her friends and is no longer a social person. She's apparently been cooped up in her house with her boyfriend. These are some very glaring signs that your sister is dealing with depression. Instead of calling your sister's behavior that of ""the very kind of people I don't like"", maybe try looking deeper to see what you can do to *actually* help someone who sounds like they're really struggling.

I can see how it could be uncomfortable, especially if it catches you off guard. However, she has every right to use the bathroom that she identifies with (especially since that’s school policy). And with that you might have to make some adjustments to make yourself more comfortable.

I don't think you can even imagine the amount of stress that is and then to come home, do the housework, and make dinner while you're doing that. I would lose my fucking mind. That guy I lived with at least cooked dinner and half assed the house work and I was still ready to kill him about half the time. 

I'm sorry, it just sounds like selfishness to me. "
ban5gv,"Given the setting, this is a literal shitpost. NTA, though. Can you imagine how much slower those lines would move if nobody except people who need it used the accessible stall?

Doesn't sound like a healthy work environment for sure. Is this a franchise and can you escalate this problem higher up than the owners?

bann0h,"ESH.

Her parents were dicks to you, that much is pretty clear.

>it seemed the only reason she wanted to give him an Arabic name was because of her parents influence and her parents are toxic

It sounds like you're making this name thing into an argument where you want her to choose between her parents or you. That's really unhealthy for the relationship. Are you sure there isn't a compromise where you can both be happy?

>I don't think we should give names that will make it harder for our son to fit in or hurt his future job prospects and there are racist people who would look at a name like Hassan or Ahmed negatively.

That reads like you're ashamed of your wife's heritage. Whether intentional or not, you're perpetuating that problem and projecting the blame onto other people.

If the problem is her parents, why is this even something that you're bringing up?

>Before we even got married we made a deal that since she was taking my last name and our kids would have my last name she would get to chose our kids names, although I could veto it if I hated it.

Would she have entered into that agreement if she knew that you planned on vetoing any Arabic names? This does not seem like a situation where either of you is sticking to the spirit of the agreement. Maybe it's time for a serious talk about whether or not that agreement was a good idea.

If you want to let her pick the name, you need to let her pick the name. If you veto all of her choices until she picks one that you like, that's pretty much the opposite of letting her pick the name.

>This made my wife angry and she started crying saying she sacrificed her relationship with her family to be with me and that I don't respect her heritage.

I can see why she's upset."
bannox,NTA I'm sorry your manager was unreasonable. Of course it takes time to learn how things are done at different establishments even if the job title is the same. I'd say you are lucky to be out of there!
banqjm,"NAH. You haven't had the conversation nor do you know what it will entail. You may want to think about what your response will be in either scenario, though (wanting to be more serious or not)."
banqr9,"NAH

Given your history of avoiding showing weakness and acting tough, I can't exactly blame your friend for not reading you correctly and thinking she could treat you like normal.

That said, given that you were seriously upset and even openly admitting to that vulnerability, I can sympathize with you for blowing up when you were seemingly shot down at the worst time.

Instead of dealing with his food waste issues, which you should stay out of since it isn't your concern, and your moral code is not shared by him, deal with the issue that does affect you. The issue of leaving your pans or pots with food in them. 

That's an issue you should be focused on, since these are, as you said, your cookware pieces. If he has leftovers he should be putting them in appropriate sealed containers. "

baobfz,"NTA. Regardless of whether it was cleanable or fixable, it is no longer going to work the same as it did previously. If the pot is warped from being bent, it won't cook evenly. Both roommates agreed to replace it. They absolutely should. Either one or both. They did not respect someone else's property and as a result damaged it.

bap46n,ESH your daughter lied and that makes her somewhat of an asshole. You grounding her until the end of the year is **very excessive**. You and your wife should have a conversation about why she can't go to prom with someone you don't know. Grounding her for the rest of the school year is going to make her more secretive and cover her tracks better. In about a year or two she'll be an adult.

If you really value her friendship, it would be better to bring it up directly and see what she says. It may be that she'll stop, but if not, you should be honest with her and say that you're going to start telling the truth. If you go behind her back to expose her, odds are that she will find out down the line, and then it'll be even worse for you. Might as well make a clean cut of it now."

I left my books in the common room for literally 2 minutes while I went upstairs to get something to drink, and when I came back down, it was all gone.  The really sucky part was that I had my final in two days, so I had to buy another textbook so I could study and pass.

You said you grabbed some lunch - so it wasn't just a couple of minutes that you were gone, correct?  If I were waiting to use the computer and ten minutes passed by without someone coming back, I might move their stuff too.  It's not ""your"" desk and ""your"" computer, even if it's your stuff.

I spent much of my childhood bloodying the nose of any kid who dared to use her adoption as a way to make fun of her. The child inside of me wants to strangle you through the screen. 

But... Your feelings are valid. No matter how vile they are. NAH. 

Just for the record, I hope that this is just some kind of social indoctrination, and that you really aren't a shitty person at heart. My own personal feelings are obviously coloring my comment, here, but I feel like I have to say this: An adopted child is a REAL child. And no matter how much you try to treat them equally, your children will pick up on your feelings. Children are amazingly and tragically perceptive to unconscious cues from the adults around them.

It’s almost like (though I know you don’t mean to) saying that she didn’t have a significant impact on you. 
Idk where you live or what kind of culture you’re from, but in my culture your last name is what links you to your family. After all your loved ones are gone, it’s the one thing you have of theirs and it’s something to honor.

You can just stop being friends with someone; you can’t stop being family. So is your not speaking to the individual in question/cutting ties going to have long term consequences?  However, if you feel that strongly; it’s your house and your family, you get to decide who you want in your life. "
bau6dc,"NTA.

Honestly, if you want to change your last name then go ahead and do it. At the end of the day, it's your decision and no one else's."
bau79o,NTA- If he had a burn permit then I don’t think there’s much you can do. We have a neighbor that pulls the same shit in MI it’s super annoying but it is what it is.
bau92r,NTA. Shit kids and shit parenting 
baubcg,"YTA

Why are you moving in with someone it appears you have very little respect for? It looks like you want to be upset with him. This whole thing reads like an angry rant. 

I'm all for treating your pets with love like they are family but it's his pet snake and if he wants to find it a new home to keep *your* cat safe, that's his prerogative. Some snakes *are* dangerous to small mammals and you can't just expect them to ""get along"" because you want them to. 

Also sorry maybe you can explain? I don't understand what he said that was homophobic."

bauspm,"A tough one I’m going to go for YTA . 

Only because you are asking about this situation I’m not counting his previous behaviour. 

You told him to move and that you wouldn’t see him, it would be extremely hypocritical to then ask this favour off him. Although I am feeling that maybe you should be the arsehole and just ask anyway. Tough one :) "
bauuem,[removed]
bauw1b,NAH- she doesn't want you to solve her problem. She just wants you to empathize and shut up.
bauydt,NAH. Tread carefully. I would phrase this as you want him to seek help for his mental health and I would add that it’s important that he has people in his life that support healthy mental health and not one’s that trigger him to devolve. 
bav2d2,"NTA. Your gf overreacted. The correct reaction if she thought you were flirting would be to come over and insert herself in the conversation to see what's going on. 

Maybe the other girl did have some intentions? Who knows. It never made it to that point and you never entertained it."
bav3eg,"NAH, your both used to how you/your parents treat a house and one another. This is a learning experience for both of you, have a mutual diolouge establish mutual expectations and be forgiving. Also yes gross kitchen things stay in the kitchen and bathroom things stay in the bathroom."

bav9jt,"NTA

You guys ended things on bad terms and you never gave it to her, plus she asked you if you wanted to keep the t-shirt, meaning there was the possibility of her taking it back. She’s the asshole just for that. And then she went on to spread rumours about you? Even more of an asshole. 

You’re on the right here"
bavbmr,"YTA, but to yourself not to him. Why stick around someone who makes you so uncomfortable? You don’t need to do that. You are under no obligation to be friends with this guy. If anything you are causing yourself more harm than good by pretending. Don’t do this to yourself!"
bavc5i,"NAH, sorry you two had to go through that"
bavcgp,"NAH.  She was so sweet to gift you the scrub but the smell is too intense for you.  You could try to use it on your feet to exfoliate then wash them with something else to mitigate the scent, but she might as well enjoy it if she can.  "
bavgwc,"YTA

She already gave you leash by being okay with the hens, and now you call her crotchety for not wanting a rooster?  It's apparent she also complained about Jim's roosters, so it's not like she singled you out."
bavj1o,"YTA. Obviously. You weren't even involved, just said something mean because you felt justified, for some reason. You had no leg to stand on, there. "

baw2d6,"NTA- you’ve said no. You have clearly defined reasons and boundaries and you have repeatedly reinforced them.
Anyone pressuring you to do something you aren’t comfortable with is an asshole.
Sorry you e been dealing with that."
baw92o,"YWBTA - but only if you lost your shit and screamed at him. The dude just had a heart attack.

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he like the reach & validation he gets from social media just like a lot of people do. You have a right to be upset that your own father isn't letting you know when major family events occur.

If he refuses to change his behavior, a simple solution may be to just make sure he @-mentions you in each post or in a comment on his post(s)."
bawaf6,"NTA. She's an adult and could have stopped drinking at any time. Also, lots of people get drunk at their weddings and she didn't cause a scene or embarrass anyone, so what's the problem?"
bawcp6,"NTA. I'm sorry they forgot your birthday, especially an important one such as your 18th. More so, it's worse that they essentially 'doubled down' by listing all the birthdays and omitting yours. While it might be seen by your mom's side of the family as an overreaction, it's certainly a reasonable response to being left out. I hope you put this birthday behind you."
bawdjk,"NAH but I think speaking would be the right thing to do. If you really can't get over your fear I think your sister will understand but as her sibling, and especially since your Dad can't speak, it's understandable she wants you to. I think it's important to remember you do not have to give some crazy long or intense speech - tbh half the people probably won't be paying attention. You can keep it short and it's totally okay to get up there with note cards which should help with nervousness (I've been to multiple weddings where people used note cards it won't be weird). You just have say some nice words about the couple and how happy you are to have this person joining your family and maybe a funny story about when you and your sister were kids then thank everyone for coming."
bawefu,"NTA. She was totally inconsiderate. Maybe if she gets left out enough times, she'll learn to respect other people's time. It's ridiculous to expect three people to wait around on one person."
bawg0e,"NAH.

It can be hard to show intent through text! Maybe she interpreted it as you having a lack of trust in her, and checking in to make sure she was really where she said she was.

I'm sure that this will blow over once the two of you have had the chance to see each other and hug it out!"

bawoht,"NAH, but we (i mean, most of redditors) are not psychoterapists, and therefore are not able to emit a diagnosis.

baws1t,YTA if you don’t have an actual reason that’s just controlling
bawt3h,"NAH. I think you not replying is sort of asshole-y, but I think that may be because you’re shy and overwhelmed with the idea of continuing a conversation? Remember, him saying happy birthday doesn’t mean you have to be engaged in a drawn out convo and reconnect, it’s a simple and quick way to show someone you care, so just say “thank you” and move on. Kinda shitty to flat out ignore him."
bawtml,Gentle YTA. Your intentions are good but it is kind of a asshole move to give away a gift someone else bought you especially since you live with them plus they gave it to you when you were 12 and still use it from time to time.
bawy33,"NTA. Paying tuition is a gift, and he's acting incredibly entitled. You're not obligated to provide him with the ""college experience"", whatever the hell that is.

He should be grateful you're offering anything."

Keep throwing it in the sink. If you get shit for it just say ""There wouldn't be hair to throw in the sink if [sister] cleaned it up like she's supposed to"""
bax330,"At a baseline, NTA - his comments were really inappropriate. If it meant that much to you, sure you can end the relationship...

...but people make inappropriate jokes & say dumb shit all the time. A year of an otherwise healthy relationship is a lot to throw away over some drunken comments. Which leads me to...

INFO: Was there something else going on that was pushing you to break up with him, and this tipped the scales?"
bax46z,"YTA.

You're a thief dude."
bax48o,"NTA. I wouldn't make a public scene about it (the guy in charge of the app is honestly an asshole for suggesting you should), I'd just quietly go to HR about it."
bax4oy,"YTA. Are you not a mom? I'm a dad and I agree its kind of a ludicrous question because breast v. formula isn't some simple decision and as a parent I would hope they drilled into you that you can't just go back and forth. If the kid has been on formula for awhile, whose to say mom is even producing? Further, theres costs associated with breast i.e. pumping, storage, etc. And lastly, as indicated, if you need to go on post-partum meds you can't breast feed. I think thats the issue, your asking a question that makes you side-eye how little info you have on this topic. Its almost like asking someone struggling to pay rent ""Have you considered just living in your summer home?"""
bax676,"NTA, but don’t be surprised if he takes it as you being interested in him if he does find out, crazy people only get more attached when they’re invested. Stay safe definitely a super sketchy dude."
bax735,NTA. In no way at all could you ever be the asshole here. At a young age like that things can get very confusing and your mother should be very open to the idea of being called grandmom or nan or granny ect.

baxim3,"YNTA Your family is. I don't know where you're from, but most places it's literally illegal to send a child to bed without dinner as a punishment. But I would try to talk to your mom or Nana seperately, just one on one and try to calmly explain what happened."

IF the woman decides to get married again and IF she asks your wife to be in the wedding again, there's a very real possibility that she won't want to use the same bridesmaids dresses since they'll be tied to the first almost-marriage.   I really doubt any bride would want that kind of connection.

You're well within your rights to ask her to sell it to try and recoup some of the costs."

bay2zb,"Disagreeing is fine. The way I see it OP just talked to the exact same person about the exact same thing the other employee did, there doesn’t seem to be a better person to talk to about it imo.

When I taught classes, cheaters really pissed me off. The administration made it impossible to actually punish them, but I still didn't like it.  I never made the class difficult so you had to cheat, you just had to read the book and do the homework. I also had copious office hours that no one attended.

Fuck cheaters."
baz81n,"YTA for scheduling it over her birthday and then not bringing her along IF that's what she actually wants. You're fucking her over pretty bad in favor of your own hobbies. An 11 day tour is not going to make you any money, it's not a full time thing, it's a hobby.

If you had just been upfront and said ""hey, our band wants to go on tour these dates, but we'd like it to be a band-only trip, do these dates work?"" then it's a NAH situation. You should have communicated."

You won't necessarily be able to stop the behavior, so instead look to the source--what's her self-esteem like, what is her peer group like, and what is motivating this behavior?  Does she have issues that could benefit from family therapy? How did she cope with the divorce? These are all important questions that might address the root, rather than just trimming back the branches."

bb0777,"NTA. Are you serious? You’ve already “loaned” him over $5000 that he’s never paid back and has no intention of paying back. It’s very generous that you’ve willing to write the loan off, but that doesn’t change how shitty and entitled it is to borrow from a good friend and just not pay them back. This guy isn’t destitute, he works and makes a salary. I cannot fathom why he thinks it’s appropriate for him to ask you for large sums of money like that like you’re his personal bank. 

Ok, he’s been a good friend to you when you’ve needed him, that’s what friendship is about, I’m sure you’ve been there for him too. But this is ridiculous. You don’t “owe him” monetary payment for having been your friend.

EDIT: Also, how the hell do you get yourself in a situation where you owe 10K in taxes? Maybe I’m not familiar with the US system, but where I live your taxes are automatically taken out of your salary and then you get a tax refund when you do your taxes.

You said yourself there was a problem with late employees. The manager tried to institute a change and whenever a manager has to do that, they can't afford to make exceptions- not even for the top employees. Otherwise it makes them look like they pick and choose who has to follow the rules. Or worse, it makes everyone think they don't need to respect the rules anyway.

bb1n5g,"NTA, your boxing teacher is responsible for managing the behavior of the kids and they shouldn't be getting away with interrupting practice like that for another member. I was in a karate class and if anyone ever acted the way they did they would be yelled at and severely punished.

You, however, need to stop being a pushover about it. They are three years younger than you find a way to handle it. I'm not saying beat the shit out of them, just don't let them do that. They are at the point where they think they can mess with you cause you never do anything."
bb1o7z,NTA - he is objectively a manbaby. Someone has to call him out bc his mom definitely isn't.
bb1rb9,"I wanna say NTA cause fuck him honestly and his problems. I guess I'll play devil's advocate, did the girl know about you? Maybe he was playing you both."
bb1uk3,NTA if there are other machines available why are they so fixated on using yours.
bb1yl0,"NAH. Ultimately I don't think either of you are in the wrong. But his parent's views are not his own. If he is a good person, and supports your family despite his parent's obvious disapproval he sounds like a decent guy. 

I also understand your apprehension. His parents seem like they're probably outspoken about this which is not comfortable for you to have to deal with when it sounds like you have two very loving mothers who just happen to be gay."
bb1yu1,NTA. You can never be an asshole for how you feel. Everyone is entitled to their emotions.
bb1z23,"YTA - A gift is a gift man. Sure you don’t like it, plenty of people dislike gifts, but accept it and move on. Her hurt feelings even if only temporary are worth much more than $50."

He shouldn't be talking like that to *any* student, or really any person in general. A person like that shouldn't even be teaching, jesus."
bb25bp,"NTA, with a caveat. I'm going with NTA because calling you a baby and saying you'll fuck things up isn't an appropriate way for him to talk to you.

That said, asking your dad to come make introductions for a business meeting and then leave isn't really good optics. I totally get struggling with anxiety and the difficulty that comes from transitioning from a student role into the workforce, but this is a relatively ordinary, low pressure meeting. It's the sort of thing an employee or someone being recommended for a job would need to do on their own. If the contact is a total stranger to you, having your dad show up to do this with you could actually hurt your chances since it could impact their perception of you. Asking for it doesn't make you an ""asshole"" per se, but it might give the contact concerns about your ability to interact with co-workers/clients (or anyone else depending on what this industry is)."
bb27en,"NTA, but you've probably shot yourself in the foot by losing your cool. What math subject/level are you in? I can probably suggest some good resources if that would be any help.

Edit: and what textbook are you using?"
bb27ir,"NTA.  You shouldn't be guilted in to giving more of yourself than reasonable. You're own baby takes a lot of work, especially those first few months. You were sleep deprived, stressed, and hormonal all before worrying about SIL's problems."
bb28s8,"ESH: You're being condescending. Just let her have the win, it literally doesn't matter. Then this: 

>I can’t afford stuff right now like an engagement ring, vacation, or taking time off (I don’t get any paid leave or sick days). Sometimes Martha will ask where her ring is, and it’s really making me feel like she doesn’t appreciate me or doesn’t understand. If I tell her I have zero money, she’ll say I don’t make enough at my job.

Until she has a job, she has no business pressuring you about your finances, and then equating her efforts to yours. Cleaning the house is not a 50 hour a week job."
bb29bp,"NTA, real friends would respect your very reasonable wishes not to have alcohol at YOUR party."

bb2grh,"It's not a huge deal, but if there's another stall available then YTA a little bit. Keep in mind that you can use any stall you want, but they can *only* use that stall. By using it you're essentially locking them out of using the entire bathroom."
bb2jao,"NTA: You worked hard for this. The people there for you should be the ones who supported you, instead of trying to tear you down. I was a hard child as well (ADHD, Depression that surfaced as anger) but my parents helped me and therefore they will be at my graduation. This is about YOUR accomplishments, not theirs. Fuck 'em."
bb2jv5,"Struggling on giving an answer, but I would feel pretty odd in your boyfriend's shoes with you looking for conversation on chatroulette. I don't think there's anything *inherently* wrong with what you're doing, but it would definitely feel weird if my girlfriend was looking for conversation late at night on skeevy websites.

Edit: I would go with NAH. There's nothing inherently wrong, but it does strike me as *odd* regardless of the context or intent behind it."

bb2prz,"NTA.

You’re not going to hear this from your friends, because let’s face it, most will see you as a traitor, so let me say it: you did the right thing. Getting clean and out of that lifestyle was the best decision you could have made and it may be hard now, but you won’t regret it in the future."
bb2rl9,">She challenged me and asked if we had a kid who was allergic to strawberries, would my family change the tradition then? I told her I don't know, probably? How is this even relevant?

bb2xou,"NTA. You didn't insult her, you didn't say anything to her face, you didn't leave her with the bill, you didn't immediately ditch- you're allowed to not want to continue with a date. People can't help what they're physically attracted to, and physical attraction is a large part of forming a romantic relationship."
bb2y90,"NAH- you're not an asshole for not responding if you don't want to. At the same time, you didn't really ask for help. You basically said you were doing pretty good, and had a few bad days. That isn't a cry for help, so I'm not sure how you wanted your friend to react."
bb2zx5,"NTA, she's using your friend. On top of that, your friend kinda seems creepy for hanging around an underage girl so much and could get himself in serious legal trouble even if he never sleeps with her (supplying her with booze/weed, even if he didn't he could be on the hook if she gets busted and says he did). He needs to stop seeing her ASAP."

bb32p9,NTA- Cs get degrees
bb33i9,"YTA- you are that guy. As you said, you KNEW she had no power to do anything about it and was simply following orders, and you still took out your frustration on her. Your ire should be directed at the administrators higher up the ladder, not the worker  on the lowest rung."
bb34fa,"NAH. Imo, a maaaajorly obvious side effect of social media and groups is they get hiveminds, and it sounds like this has effected your sister. Everyday we see posts from people in the community telling us what to support and what's toxic, followed by the comments section backing them up. There's no space to question it, and even if you do it's not a supportive space to go in the opposite direction of the river. 

Question stuff, make your own decisions, but spend some good time contemplating it and looking up information. An informed decision will make you feel more certain about your standpoint, and it'll be easier to defend it when someone asks you about it. Alternatively, who knows, maybe you'll change your opinion on the way. That's all, have a good day. :)"
bb34yu,NTA- you. Don’t. Throw. Things. Around. Babies. Especially newborns and ESPECIALLY preemie newborns. Those kids are just gonna get worse and worse unless something changes

bb37p8,"NAH. Ha, I could see myself making a mistake like this. Obviously, you didn’t mean anything by it. I wouldn’t dwell. 

I seriously doubt she thought much of it either. It was probably just an “OK this conversation is over” walk away."
bb390q,"NTA, but you need to tell them in advance so they have enough time to prepare (around 1-2 months)"

bb3bjo,"YTA -

I’m only saying this because it really sucks to be the person who thinks they’re being ignored or blown off. My former friend did this to me all the time and she would be online tweeting at everyone but would take days to respond to a text from me.   It takes only a second to say something to let the person know you will chat later. 

Don’t be surprised when your friends take the hint that you’re blowing them off and stop texting. It’s what I did."

bb3qow,"YTA for a few reasons

1. You're wrong, plenty of virgin drinks are delicious (on vacation when I was young I survived on virgin Daiquiris)

2. Your girlfriend was trying to have some fun and you just shit all over it.  Even if you think it's dumb, it's dickish to shit on someone who's just trying to have a good time"
bb3tw9,NAH I don’t think you are an asshole. But try to imagine how much extra money and work it will be for the families to set up 2 and plan different weekends and buy presents etc. won’t some people end up skipping one or the other because it’s just too much? I can see it from everyone’s perspective. It’s nice to feel special but also going to be hard if the same people have to plan both and have it take over even more of their time to try and be fair to both when most people would likely prefer to attend one on only one date.
bb3ucb,"NTA, you don't owe anybody your friendship regardless of your history with the person. Though I would maybe tell her if you decide to not be her friend but you also don't owe her that either."

bb4arp,"NTA. You are justified in feeling uneasy. That kind of talk perpetuates the whole culture of sexual harassment. I don't care if it's a man talking about a woman, or a woman talking about a man, or what have you. ""Joking"" like that with people in public, in front of others whom you don't know, is inappropriate. It's rude, and they were out of line. Even if they didn't mean anything bad by it, it is at the very least extremely inappropriate."
bb4drv,YTA for your double standards. Don't be surprised if she rejects you for sleeping around.
bb4e4h,"NTA but holy shit- he actually said the words “oversensitive bitch”?” 

The problems here are bigger than the massage boner in that case..."

bb4fpr,"YWBTA if you expect him to pay your rent while you’re spending the time abroad.  Unequivocally, yes.  Your rent should have been fully factored into the cost of going abroad for however long you’re going, unless you had no rent to pay.  But you have rent, so you must pay it. To ask him to pay EXTRA to live while you’re having fun in another country would be absurd."
bb4p8t,"NTA, that's a misandrist belief, not a feminist one. All she's doing spouting nonsense like that is hurting the feminist cause"
bb4s2k,"NTA your friend was completely inappropriate. His text was definitely a proposition of sorts - it's a ""I would hit it if you weren't married"" and potentially a ""I would hit it anyway if you're willing to"" sort of text. 

That's crossing boundaries, and it's a bit concerning your wife is either blind to it, or doesnt want to acknowledge it."
bb4t33,"YTA: you agreed to a sitter, you knew your partner's opinion and worries and ignored all that to do what you want.

you were being selfish if you had an issue with a sitter don't agree to it you did lie. 

why did you want to do drugs on your own? would it have changed anything to have a sitter and some stimulus?"
bb4veq,"NTA. This kind of shit is unacceptable from anyone, let alone a teacher."
bb4w2p,"NTA

Why would you want to be invited to a family event where you're being discriminated against anyway? 

You're old enough and grown enough to get an adult portion so you deserve one. 

The best way to handle it would have been to talk to your parents about your portions (though it sounds like this maybe wasn't an option at the time)"
bb50ux,"NTA I completely feel you here. I believe that the best course of action is to complete the project, because you have already invested time, money and effort into it. Do inform your teacher about the way your teamwork went and who contributed and who did not.

I don't recommend quitting because that would mean disrespecting the other folks who actually worked on the project."
bb50wd,"ESH.

Your coworker shouldn’t have been behaving like that and management should have dealt with it before it got to this point, but screaming at him (from your description, that sounds like far more appropriate description than “snitching”) was in no way appropriate, at all but especially in front of customers. Besides, if he behaved so badly with any regularity would it really have been so hard to get proof of the managers?"
bb50wk,"ESH - You’ve said yourself that you often forget to clean up as you get distracted. It really isn’t that difficult to clear up after yourself and keep the place tidy. So you really aren’t helping yourself. That being said, if you truly aren’t the only person to leave mess around the house, your ‘grandad’ shouldn’t be singling you out."
bb5357,"Ugh. NTA, it’s public transport, you have the right to sit where you want. But as a small woman, I kinda hate it how all the large people gravitate towards sitting next to me because they think they can take up more of the seat and squish me over into a corner. Like, dude, I’m still entitled to my half of the two seater train seat!"
bb598c,"NTA - 

However, your dad on the other [hand](http://imgur.com/26KYGH7)

Also its really weird that they had the candle, seems as though they might have been invited and chose the other persons party above yours"
bb5dxg,"Your parents sound controlling but also like they were trying to choose what was best for you. First child syndrome probably. I would say you're NTA. Wouldn't say your parents were complete assholes, just wrong. You're right to be angry but upside, you're an adult now, they are paying for your school and in a few short years, FREEDOM :)"
bb5lvl,"YTA.

1. Firstly, if you think kids magically turn into mature, responsible, worldy-wise adults at the stroke of midnight on their 18th birthday you're deluded.
2. Your job as a parent is to love, nurture and teach your daughter how to be level-headed, reasonable, compassionate, etc. Sounds like you're doing none of those things. Kicking her out and disowning her will accomplish nothing. She will resent you and you'll irreparably damage your relationship with her, and probably your own relationship with your wife. You'll probably damage your wife's relationship with your daughter too.
3. You seem pretty okay with disowning your daughter at the drop of a hat here. Like, you wouldn't care if you never see her again? I think that's weird, and a sign of a terrible parent.
4. I think you think this will ""teach her a lesson"" or something, but it won't. Everyone in your family here will be worse off after you kick her out and disown her. Nobody will gain a thing.
5. The fact she stole and tried to pawn a family heirloom shows she has her own problems, and that means she needs help. As her parent, that is your responsibility, and should be your concern. She could be lacking a moral compass; maybe doesn't respect you or your wife; could be lacking a sense of compassion. Those things might come directly from how you parent (i.e. without compassion or sense of reason). It's possible she could even have a drug problem or something. You should be trying to figure out why she stole from you, and taking action to set her on the right path so she can be the happy and responsible adult you think she should already be."
bb5t87,YTA - Pretty much every reason you listed. Being called exotic is not a compliment even if you intend to use it as such. It is outdated rhetoric and I've yet to meet a single woman who appreciated being called exotic.
bb62lk,"NTA your dad should be less of a slob and clean up after himself.  Everyone in a household should contribute to the running of it.  Your dad’s primary contribution is working and your contribution is household chores, but that doesn’t excuse this disrespectful stuff."
bb69h0,"ESH. She was shitty *at times*, but so were you. Some of your complaints are genuine, others are you just needing thicker skin and realizing its time to grow up. 

At 19, you're an adult and can take full responsibility of your mental health. You can also get a job. Were you bad with your significant other? That's hard to comment on since we don't know. Your complaints about your father seemed serious, so maybe it was best. Again, not enough info there. What's wrong with staying with your dad *because* he was ill and living in a house ready to be taken? Your rules sound reasonable coming from a parent. Your complaints against rules makes you sound ignorant and entitled. 

I just don't understand some of your points."
bb69ip,"YWBTA if you DEMAND she stop talking to this guy friend. 

However, its totally within your right to tell her how her interactions with this dude make you feel, and the concerns you may have for your relationship and her safety. This dude sounds like a creep and she seems to know it.  

From personal experience with guys like this- sometimes they blow up when you ask them to leave you alone, and sometimes its easier and less drama to just do a slow exit, stop answering messages and block. Let her make the decision about how she does it- shes the one (probably) with more creepy dude experience and shes the one who will have to deal with any fallout."
bb6d72,"YTA if you're doing this mainly to destroy his relationship to get back at this dude, which is kinda how you come off in this post...mentioning him getting in trouble for sending pics of your friend and now your friend has been single.

bb6x3j,YTA. Both these people are more important than casual acquaintances and you should have been worried enough about the man who opened his home to you to at least call and check up on him and your FWB.
bb6x9q,"ESH, I would say. She's an asshole for pointing that out and commenting on it to you, but going off on her I don't think was the right response. It sounds like this is a one time thing; if this had been a recurring problem I may have leaned more towards NTA."
bb79ai,"YTA/YWBTA. This is a case where telling the 100% full truth is just unnecessary. I don't know if it would be hurtful or insulting to your manager, but the chances are more than zero, and you don't need to do it. What you're saying about your stress levels and compassion fatigue is more than enough to justify changing your job to your manager - leave her pregnancy out of it.

Good luck with whatever you decide to do next."
bb7epd,"YTA I recently memorialized my father's facebook, and it was an emotional experience for me. It took me over eight months to come to terms with doing it. It may seem like nothing to you, but when you are truly close to someone even little things like this can be a stab to the heart because it's a bitter reminder that they really are gone. It's hard to admit that when you're grieving. 

First of all, you say you weren't even close to the person before doing this, so why exactly did you feel it was your place to do this? If it bothered you that the page wasn't memorialized you could have just deleted it. 

Second of all, if an account doesn't have a set legacy account it becomes completely locked down once it is memorialized. They will have no way of setting special memories and photos, no way of viewing any photos that had been set to private, and depending on the privacy settings they may not even be able to post to the page. You essentially locked them out. It's always possible that they didn't have the password and were searching for it so they could save photos and adjust settings before memorializing yet you've stripped them of the chance. 

If it was my family member I would be beyond infuriated that someone had done this, 100x moreso if I found that they weren't even close."
bb7gkm,"NTA

Holy self-absorbed, Batman! (Not OP, but the friend)

Why are you still friends with someone who only values you for your entertainment?? I know you've been friends since 15, but damn she does not care about you as a person one iota. This is s toxic person that you have obligation to reach out to. Feeling down?? She needs a therapist or psychiatrist then, not to send you abusive message after message. You are not her mental health professional.

And your other friend is also an as*hole for encouraging and enabling this nonsense. Get some new friends cuz ugh, too much bullcrap here."
bb7hj8,"NTA, honestly it doesn't even sound like a joke. It's, like you said, a statement. We all know humor is subjective, but this just isn't funny. Where's the punchline? You cleaned your house because ... cooties? 

Good for you for standing up to this guy! I can imagine some kid that's following their livestream hearing that joke and feeling like they're disgusting for their attractions. I hope your bf comes to see your point of view."
bb7ivy,"YTA! You're gross. ""the girls aren't super young either"" mentions age 13. 

Having body pillows of lewd images of 13 year old girls is absolutely creepy and disgusting. 13 - 18. 13 - 17 are still children what the hell OP? I'm not saying you're an asshole. I'm just judging you as a disgusting creep."

bb8499,"NAH but a bit confused why it seems like you’re parenting her son instead of her? Why was it up to you to take away the tablet, toys etc."
bb8c1p,NTA - Those clothes were meant for struggling people. People who can't always afford brand new clothes. Not your BF's sister whose parents could easily afford new clothes for her. I absolutely see where you are coming from. If she had asked beforehand about taking a few items that would be a different story but she just helped herself. Would it be OK for someone to dip into a food donation box before dropping it off because they liked some of the donated items? Hell no.
bb8grx, NTA.  Not much else you can do without lying.
bb8i3a,"NTA 

If anything, he should see it as a compliment because you do it to him"
bb8if1,"NTA. As much as you're ethically in the wrong, you have the right to tell someone not to talk to you; the fact that he is autistic is irrelevant to the crucial information, which is that you don't want to talk to someone. That being said, you could be more tactful in how you get the message across."
bb8jgc,"Nta. Sounds like he is too comfortable with your shit. Also lol has he admitted to all the pissing and ravioli? Cause you blacked out, could have been you that did that."
bb8mgz,"NTA. First of all, I think your grandparents are being very polite: they're giving your MIL the option of taking photos with them, or hanging out. It sounds like she has chosen the latter, which is fine. She could bring a book to read while she waits. It doesn't sound like something worth getting upset over. If she doesn't want to be sitting around, then she could take photos with everyone. Or read a book!

Also, different cultures are different. So the fact that your wife is assuming your family ""doesn't understand common courtesy and how to treat guests properly"" is ridiculous. How does she know what common courtesy is in China?"
bb8pas,"NAH, I think you're overthinking it.  He hasn't given you any indication that he doesn't want to be friends still, you admit that the distance is caused at least to some extent by your own lack of casual interaction as you used to."

bb9dgo,"ESH - you could have handled the situation better, ie. Explain and apologize, saying you didn't know and there was no malicious intent. But she also didn't need to be so confrontational about it and should have accepted your explanantion."

bb9mtq,"NTA.  It's your choice whether you want to go through with meeting him.  I would hesitate too if I found out that person had a manslaughter charge.  I would have just had a friend accompany you to make the exchange.  Even if they don't have a criminal record, I avoid giving out my address if I can help it.  I know it's a bit harder with a couch, but I would have got a friend with a truck to help move it to a neutral location like a mall parking lot."

You can't tell him you like the food and then come back later on complaining about how bad it is. You want to spare his feelings, but then tell him the food is making you gag? And you're definitely an entitled ass hole, just because ""he can definitely afford making me something different"" doesn't mean he has to. How old are you?

I would hesitate to put myself in a position where I was being outright used like that. They left you to do it all _knowing_ they would each individually be responsible for completing the homework - so I think it’s on them. What are they gonna say “oh I let OP do all the work and then OP wouldn’t do my homework for me?” Depends how you handle conflict - but this is some bullshit. Plus also if you go into marketing you’re going to have assholes like this who rock up unprepared and ready to claim your work as their own, so just be aware that marketing is LIKE that."
bb9v2d,"NAH. Trans only spaces are very important, honestly. But so are ones where cis people, especially close friends and family members are allowed. There is an importance and benefit to both. I think it wouldn't be the worst idea to explain how beneficial it was to have cis people be allowed, at least sometimes, to the leader. Perhaps there is a compromise to be made here, where cis people are allowed every other month, or a separate group is set up.

&#x200B;

Edit: Trans only spaces are important because it is a place where no one has to worry about catering to cis experiences/questions/etc. It is nice to have a space where everyone has a kind of uniform baseline understanding of what it feels like to be trans, and these spaces can serve as a place for people to really go in depth about it. Often times the mixed spaces serve as a learning place for cis people, which is SO important. But I imagine it'd be frustrating for trans people trying to really dig into their identities and experiences.

Tell her she needs to grow up and be responsible for her own life. You are not her slave and not required to do what should’ve been her work and her responsibility in the first place.

bb9z40,NTA I would ask if they would accept the bank statement with everything else blacked out?
bb9zyd,"NAH - Honestly I'm shocked at how many people are saying YTA. From your edit it sounds like you're going above and beyond to help these people, more so than most would. People are not entitled to have pets. Pets are not a right. They are living, sentient beings with their own ability to feel pain and suffering, and if someone can't look after their pets they should not have them. I agree that the animals might help them with their mental health but that does not come as a priority to the animal's own wellbeing and right to live in a clean, safe environment."

Grow the fuck up and communicate like an adult, dude, or _at the very least_ send it to her in a text when she texts you.

Addressing the issue with him directly didn’t work. His behavior was certainly unacceptable. Pranking him, without harming him in any way, is a decent way to make the point.

It's great that your dog would have a big building and a heating pad to keep him somewhat warm - but that's no substitute for living in a house with his people, getting attention, and being warm 24/7 without having sleep on a small heating pad (What are y'all going to do in the summer? I know it gets hella hot in Minnesota too).

> ""I don't really want an indoor dog""

Then give the dog up to a family that is willing to give him the love and adoration he deserves, rather than confining him to being outdoors in all of the incliment weather that comes with being up north.

Or, if you're deadset on having an animal but think your house isn't big enough, get a smaller dog and give the St. Bernard (who is gonna be a BIG BOY) to someone with more space."
bbbqd0,"NTA

D&D games can be badly derailed by a player who thinks they're funny, this guy is clearly TA because that kind of behaviour ruins everyone's time.

There is an idea called good faith. When you play in good faith, you are playing to make the game fun for everyone, and to help the DM tell the best story he can. When you play in bad faith, you are ignoring what the group wants and making yourself laugh, or trying to ruin things because you think its funny. 

A bad faith player can learn to be a good faith one. Maybe when you are experienced you can ask him back on the condition he plays in good faith. But right now, as a new DM, not inviting him is the right choice."
bbbtkc,"NTA. Why should you go around telling all of your friends every time you hear a piece of information about one of their exes? . You didn't lie, and you didn't even lie by omission because it never came up."
bbc0xq,"NTA i understand but trust me its better to stay out of peoples relationships cause theyll only get pissy and bitchy about it and its usually way too late and the shits already dried and caked to the fan blades before they see that it was a bad idea and you were right, let them make their own mistakes"
bbc8aw,NAH. That sounds like a conversation that needs to be had between mom and dad.

Visa credit is a widely acceptable form of payment in the year 2019.  Any competent business owner/manager would know that not informing the customers of this change will cause delays. The employees having to put things away is a cost of business and is a result of the decisions made by management.  

It's unfortunate the employees have to do the added work, but that's upon them to voice their ideas to management on how informing the customer would increase production.  To me, this is a employee-management issue and it's upon them to hash out."

Standards of language have changed over the past 20 years. Swearing doesn't carry the taboo it once did. But it is always a good idea to watch one's french in presence of others one might not know. You have a valid concern about someone flying off the handle.

&#x200B;

Ideal thing to do would be to talk with your BF about it and get his temperature on the subject. It is highly possible he might have a filter around kids, but is somewhat oblivious of his surroundings. It might get him to be slightly mindful of his surroundings.

I'm going to say YTA.

I'm sure he doesn't want to be this way, and the way you're wording things makes you sound selfish. I know dealing with someone that depressed is hard and discouraging - but he needs your support.

bbe555,"NTA - Your friend cannot use ADHD as a crutch for poor behaviour. Coming from someone who has and struggled with it, understanding your disability and getting the right help to cope with your symptoms is on the individual. Learning to take responsibility/apologize instead of self-victimizing is a maturity issue. A lot of what was described sounds like typical ADHD and I get we are not all perfect people but... the ditching last minute is an problem. That typically sign of disinterest in someone. Or anxiety. Which again can be from their condition. Your might want to have a heart-to-heart to try and understand your friend better and to express how her behaviour is affecting you before writing off the friendship entirely. 

 You deserve to have someone who puts as much effort into maintaining a friendship as you do. But if they don’t want to reciprocate, you’re better off without them. Regardless of them having a learning disability."
bbe9lp,NTA. Everybody needs to vent sometimes and he didn’t need to rub your face in it at the very moment you were pissed off.
bbe9rj,"No A-holes here. You’re not an asshole for wanting to save a kid but the principal’s logic is totally sound. If it says in the rules to keep your door locked and don’t open it, then do that.

bbeb3q,"NTA, it’s your right"
bbec7g,NTA.  You don't know how he'd react to this news.  He might throw a scene and then they might dig into how he found out.  This would be something I keep out of.  Plus for all you know they could be hiring two purchasing managers.  My company has two.

bbf206,"NTA. It's your life, but consider that your relationship with your parents doesn't have to be either A. be open with them completely about yourself/your life/your sexuality or B. cut them out of your life completely.  If you're going to be living far away, you could still stay in contact, but keep them on an info diet.  

Maybe some time in the future, you'll be more comfortable coming out to them or maybe not.  I just would advise that you consider not making the choice to cut them off completely when you're 18 and might regret it later.  That will be hard to take back.  It does sound like aside from their bigotry (which is a big issue, yes), they are good parents to you and are overall, good people.  Maybe give them a chance or at least think about it for a little while once you have some distance."
bbf45i,"Is it high standards or self sabotage? The example you have looks more like he was looking for an excuse to break up than that his standards were to high to me. 

Either way, the fact that this is coming from a place of love and caring about him, *and* that it's a pattern multiple of his friends have seen means nta for bringing it up. It takes a really good friend to have a difficult conversation with their friend because they care and want to help them grow."
bbf5v9,"YTA

You lied. It's not OK."
bbf8i5,"Holy shit NTA. Your mom is a huge asshole and she’s now trying to minimize her shittiness and gaslight you and try to make it your fault for her extremely poor scheduling and communication on this matter.

In no world would it be normal to get baby shower invites less than a week beforehand especially considering most people will be buying their gifts online and having them shipped to them to bring to the event. 

For comparison, my husband and I recently attended the baby shower of a dear friend. The shower was set like 5-6 weeks before her due date, and invites were officially sent a month before that (but we had been verbally invited even a week or so before then). They intended this timeline to help get everything set up in the nursery and still have time to buy more stuff they might need after seeing what was gotten off the registry.

I am so sorry you are experiencing this. The whole point of a shower is to celebrate but also take some of the burden off of you for buying stuff. Instead you probably would have been better served planning it yourself or just buying all the stuff yourself from the get-go."

Heres a hot take, she has no source. Shes talking out of her ass and has no actual proof. She wants Amy to suffer because your mom probably isnt happy. She sees your dad happy even though shes gone and it upsets her.

It doesnt sound like she has a partner or anything so shes probably very jealous and bitter that your father found someone and shes still alone. 

The fact shes trying to drag her child into this is incredibly low. My guess is she needs some kind of counseling to get over whatever her issue is.

You know Amy isnt talking shit about her to you so you already know shes lying, source or not. Your mother really has no place to talk either way because she is constantly bad mouthing Amy. She cannot simultaneously be the victim and the perpetrator of this event. She cannot claim victimhood when she does the exact thing she is accusing Amy of. 

Honestly Id stay out of it. Tell your mom shes an adult and she can fight her own battles, her kid isnt getting in between it because thats not fair.

 ""Standing up for her"" would mean taking her side completely and telling Amy to fuck off, ruining your relationship with your father and Amy. If thats a tactic for your mom to isolate you from them it would work very well

bbjk1f,"Now to the argument. My friend is pretty reserved and has never been the type to speak out about her political stances, but I knew that in the past she's been supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, which was something we agreed on. However, last week, my friend made a comment about how being gay was against God's plan and morally wrong. All I could say was an incredulous *what!?.* I was shocked to say the least. She continued to say that God still loves gay people and having homosexual urges isn't sinful unless you act on them concluding that she thinks that gay marriage should be illegal. *WHAT!?!???* I couldn't believe my friend was saying these things. I really couldn't. After staring at her blinking for probably a good ten seconds I told her that she can believe that something was morally wrong and that was her right even if people disagree, but it was absolutely horrible of her to want to take away someone's right to marry the person they love. Everyone has the right to believe/do what they want as long as it doesn't bring harm to others and it didn't matter if it doesn't align with others' morals. If we made every ""morally wrong"" (according the the Bible) thing illegal than we wouldn't have freedom of religion, divorce, or premarital sex. She responded saying that freedom of religion and marriage equality was not a good comparison and that I was basically saying that incest was okay too since it was also two consenting adults who want to be in relationship. At this point I was fed up. I was done having a friendly discussion and I just snapped. I told her to fuck off and if this was really what she believed than I didn't want to continue our friendship because this was not the king, accepting person I become friends with. I feel like TA for yelling and walking away without letting her answer. We haven't talked since. I'm extremely hung up on this because she's my best and longest friend and I feel like I may have overreacted. AITA?

&#x200B;

Just a note: I feel like a lot of people are going to blame the church for teaching my friend hateful messages, but the sermons are always full of messages of love and understanding toward *everyone,* which is what I believe Christianity should be about. The pastor has never directly addressed gay marriage as far as I know, but then again I only attend about once a month. The general vibe of the church is *a lot* more laid back then the strict Catholic Church I went to as a kid (which I would never attend now)."

I am also from the UK and feel you're trying to paint an inaccurate picture of British pubs to sway this one in your favour. Many pubs double-up as restaurants (we call them gastropubs, don't know how universal that term is) and if they didn't there'd hardly be any left, and there's quite an obvious distinction between *family* pubs and *adult* pubs. Additionally, unless you live in a particularly unfortunate location, there's no shortage of over-18 only pubs around that you could go to if swearing is that vital to your conversations. 

You're being obtuse and pedantic with regards to pubs being adult establishments. Particularly in this case since you yourself are describing it as a child-friendly pub. If I saw you behave like this in a family pub I'd think you were an asshole too. Reading your description of the exchange makes me cringe because I can just picture exactly that situation in my head and I can imagine what everyone who heard it must've been thinking of you at the time."

They aren't livid because it's another couple, they are livid because these are total randoms from Craigslist that will be in their home. 

When they had a friend crash in your livingroom, at least that was their friend that they knew and could vouch for, and also they were in the apartment with him and also took responsibility for him. You intend to move out and leave the risk of having randoms in your room and in the common areas up to you ex-roommates. Yes, these people could be normal and down on their luck, or they could be criminals, or drug addicts or damage or steal your roommates stuff.

It sounds like you just dislike your ex roommates and see this as a way to get revenge, but it's shitty. Ask yourself how you would feel if a roommate ""sublet"" their room to complete strangers neither of you had ever met who they found on Craigslist and fucked off to live elsewhere leaving you to deal with whatever they did?
