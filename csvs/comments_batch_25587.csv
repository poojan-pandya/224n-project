bbojj9,"YTA. A baby shower isn’t about how much you love your baby. Your baby doesn’t even exist yet, don’t pretend the party is for its sake. Your baby doesn’t frigging care. It’s your own desire to feel special and make a spectacle of yourself and have people get you gifts. Well you should already have enough baby crap from last time and anything you don’t have you can buy yourself. You literally just had a baby less than a year ago. You need people to fawn all over you again?! Baby showers are tacky gift-grabby occasions anyway, and particularly so when you have a second one. And an extra “ew” for you, for referring to yourself in third person as “this Mama”.

The question is this: is it reasonable for your SO to demand that you stop hanging out with a longtime friend on the grounds that she made a drunken pass at you years ago?

**No. That is not reasonable.** She has no reason to suspect you of cheating on her. Your behavior has been beyond reproach, and your relationship with your friend is platonic."

bbp690,NTA this is beyond ridiculous for her to expect another replacement gift if she’s bailing a second time and you did everything you could to purchase them in advance and reschedule the first and second time. Her being upset at you is selfish and dismissing all of your attempts.

bbpmjk,"NAH, because she is acting very much like a 14-year-old (who is in an incredibly adult environment for her age) and you are acting as a protective parent. But I will caution you, being too restrictive isn't going to make her stop having sex - it's going to make her be more sneaky and she's going to stop talking to you about it. It's great that she felt comfortable telling you she was going on the pill. That's the type of communication you want, so if something bad happens she can rely on you. By punishing her you will be ruining that pipeline."
bbpnqy,"ESH

You the least of all.  What you said was justified completely, but still an asshole thing to resort to personal attacks like his.

bbq0k7,"NAH - It's OK to be miffed about the social pressure inherent to the way she asked. If I were you, I'd give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she didn't do it that way to try and shame people into participating. Group chat is a pretty normal way to communicate now days after all. It's also OK not to contribute. If anyone explicitly names / shames you for it, and *especially* if the GF does, that person is a colossal asshole. But I have a feeling if you just don't respond, and don't contribute, no one will notice."
bbq8qs,"NTA:

That is pretty damn racist sounding....

> I talked to my professor today and he literally told me “stop being an asshole and making things hard for me.” 

How are you making things harder on the professor, fuck that guy."
bbq983,"J is NTA.

While perhaps J should have realized that having a career, children, and the restrictions that those come with may not have been the most conducive for being an attentive bridesmaid, most reasonable people, bride or not, understand real world obligations. Once J realized she wasn’t able to meet expectations she did the right thing by dropping out. A is clearly looking for people who can provide an investment in her wedding that J can not provide. While I understand being annoyed or frustrated with that, it’s not as if J dropped out with a month or a week to go; there’s plenty of time to replace her. 

A also seems entitled. How is man with back issues supposed to help anyone move? Does she not care that excessive labor could exacerbate his issues? 

A is also being petty by not inviting J to the shower and deliberately excluding her. It’s as if A wants to punish J for not being who A wanted J to be. She’s exacerbating the situation instead of simply letting it go because she feels that being the bride entitled her to be more important than anyone and anything else. 

At the end of the day, a wedding is just a big, expensive party. It’s not really worth destroying relationships and burning bridges. Sadly, weddings and funerals do tend to bring out the worst in people. 

I would advise J to not waste the money on a sitter and sit the wedding out. If she wasn’t welcome at the shower because the bride felt uncomfortable, then it would stand to reason the bride would feel the same about J attending the wedding. J should save the money on child care, send a gift, and plan a fun activity with her husband and children. If A gets upset, well, she played a silly, childish, game and this is the prize she gets for her entitled, selfish behavior."

Why? That's not your problem and it's not your fault."
bbqokh,"NAH.

You aren't her parent, and you should respect her mother's wishes. She has every right to tell you not to spend so much on her, and there may be several reasons. Maybe their financial situation wouldn't accommodate something like this normally and she doesn't want her daughter to become accustomed to getting gifts like this elsewhere. Perhaps this is playing into a deeper insecurity the mother has about her ability to provide for her children in the ways that will make them happy. Perhaps she doesn't want there to be resentment in the future that she can't/won't provide the same thing.

If it's just the two of you, and if you have some of the materials/experience on hand, how about you two do a mani-pedi together at her home and teach her about the importance of nail care, sterilization, etc. That way it can be a bonding and learning experience, it gives you the opportunity to gift her some of the materials, and it could be a fun way to end up at (approximately) the same result.

bbsi94,"NAH because I have a hard time calling a 16 year old a AH but I do not agree with you. At 16 you are not old enough to make your own choices. I’m assuming you are driving one of your parents vehicles not your own. As a child (because you are a child whether you like it or not) you need to respect their wishes and only drive when they want you to. Besides, I can assure you that when you get older you will get more than enough time to drive and it’s not going to be nearly as fun as when you are 16. 

Obviously, I am a mom and my kids aren’t even allowed to get their license at 16 because driving is dangerous and I want to make sure I beat it into their heads how to be a responsible driver before I even consider letting them get their licenses.

Not the same thing at all. 

You don't need to be around anybody who makes you uncomfortable. If his emotional needs and crush on you make you uncomfortable or anxious walk away. I've totally been there. My dad was bipolar and after his passing one of my co-workers was leaning on me very heavily with her suicidal past and thoughts and I was OUT OF THERE! I cannot handle that and it's not my responsibility, and it's inappropriate at the workplace. 

He needs help. Even if they sound like jokes he should get help. Every joke has a grain of truth... But it is NOT your responsibility to take care of him or even to maintain a friendship.

Luckily you didn't fuck up too bad yet, I mean you can fix this no problem. Wanting to hit someone for sending creepy messages is mainly out of line, I know it makes you mad and if it happened IRL you might fight over it, but ultimately it seems like you are frustrated. Why are these guys such creeps?! You'll do better to learn about social issues and deal with them more thoughtfully than just wanting to punch anyone who's too out of line. 


But more than the feeling, talking about it all the time is quite aggressive. You're telling the person you care about that you want to hit people, harm them ruthlessly. It's not a good look and shows that you have a desire to punish people harshly who get out of line. Punching is disproportionate to most messages, and if she is not recoiling in disgust you are likely going WAY too far by expressing a desire to hit them. 


So if you cannot get over your desire to hurt bad people, at least don't talk to other people about it like this, because it is scary. What if you start to think she is bad, will you punch her? I know that seems unthinkable to you, but when you start talking about hurting people over words that she is not that upset by it's alarming. 


But she's apparently not too weirded out by your behavior. Just tone it down and just talk about how much it bothers you that people act like that. Again, I think exploring it academically could be a good outlet for your frustration. Just think: often problems are solved not by brute force but by understanding and craftiness.

But if you expressed that you didn’t want to take them in just to pay vet bills and she insisted they were fine, I also can’t blame you for being frustrated that they aren’t fine. So it wouldn’t be unreasonable for you to at least ask if she’d be able to cover all or at least part of the vet bills. Can’t really see how you could force her to, though."

I disagree that any kind of coming out needs to be a serious planned discussion these days and this guy is still probably learning how to do it as you are all pretty young.
bbwn5e,NTA but honestly almost half the people at concerts these days are filming and taking pictures. No one enforces anything anymore just movie theatres and formal play houses it seems.

You're right, he should have told you sooner. Pregnancy is obviously a bigger deal for the person carrying the child too, so he is endangering you and making things very difficult so that he won't have to have the conversation. 


Just let some time pass... You're not mad that he doesn't want the surgery, make sure he knows that because I think it's great. And then, let him know he doesn't need to be afraid to tell you stuff like that because you dont want him to do anything he doesnt want to.

Any decent co-workers would understand that. It's not your fault or problem that people are going on maternity leave. They didn't schedule their pregnancies around workplace requirements, and nor should you make your own personal decisions that way. 

One option you have is to go to your supervisor, explain the situation and see if they will agree to match the extra pay you're being offered at the new job. If they can't or won't match what you're being offered, you at least gave them every opportunity to keep you by asking. If they don't value you, your loyalty is misplaced.

Consider however this is a little kid that probably just mimics things she watches online and is being creepy without realizing it. Small kids have no concept of social inhibition and I don't believe there is intentional evil in her behavior. As an educator, it is important for you to think also that if this kid keeps being segregated for its behavior and considered ""creepy"" even by adults then the situation will worsen, I believe you should have another, very open and honest conversation with the parents, sharing your thoughts, maybe suggesting they should not allow a little kid to uncontrollably surf the net.

You meant well at the time, but I don't think you could really understand what that promise would entail at 20.  You're basically being expected to upend your life to care for your grandmother.  This situation happens often, and it's unfortunate.  Your husband wasn't a factor in the promise at the time, I'm guessing, so not only would it be affecting your life in a major way - it would be affecting him, possibly straining your relationship.

I say do what you think is best.  If your mother feels this strongly about the subject, she should take responsibility for your grandmother instead of expecting you to take it on.

Also - I'm honestly disgusted that your mother decided it was your responsibility to do this.  How does she not feel at all responsible for helping in the care of her mother?  It feels just so entitled."

bc2agf,"YTA. Its just weird that you wouldn’t tell them. It’s not as if it just never came up, because going to your family’s house for dinner where meat is served is obviously an occasion to tell them if you have dietary restrictions.

If I was your family I’d be so confused because I would feel like you were intentionally concealing being a vegetarian from me.

So why did you keep it a secret for so long?"
bc2bh7,"NAH. Your dad is obviously sensitive, bringing up the death of his brother and stuff like that. He probably thinks you look beautiful, and is just annoyed that he has less pictures of you than he did before. Parents are weird like that. At the end of the day, it's your dad showing pictures to his coworkers. I highly doubt any of them are possible SOs, and they probably think you look fine anyway. Is it really super huge deal if those pictures are on your dad's phone?"
bc2bip,"NTA. At all. He's an entitled slob and a prick to boot. He tried to start a fight between your BF and you over asking him to clean up the mess he makes with *your* dishes.

You are 100% right that calling her is a conscious choice and she seems to just want a little more money in her pocket.

> she basically bullies me into seeing her one more time because this her “process” and how she gets closure with her clients. 

Is she the therapist or are you? You don't have to explain your reasoning at all. This isn't mandated therapy from how you explained it. Her reasoning is ridiculous."

bc2goe,"NTA.

I've only ever pet-sat for an ex's family, but I know they specifically provided food whenever they had someone stay at their house and watch the pets. They expected the sitter to eat whatever was in the fridge/pantry. I would do the same if I had someone stay at my house and watch my child or pets. 

Besides, even if you eat their food you're still probably saving them money in boarding costs."
bc2iml,"YTA. If he is gay, it’s kinda fucked up to call it out before he’s ready. If he’s not gay, his GF just fucking called him gay! That sucks! Even if he is gay and not ready, that sucks! 

There was nothing definitive that says he’s gay. He could be uncomfortable around an outgoing gay guy because he’s never been around one because he’s hyper religious. 

But if yo feel that way, you two shouldn’t be together.

Edit: there are ways to approach this conversation without accusing someone of being gay or assuming their sexuality."

bc2sua,"NTA

You're rationalizing a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. Your girlfriend isn't ""naive"", not to the point that she's misunderstanding this really obvious situation. This guy is literally inviting her over to his place to spend the night. ""Maybe next time""? She said that in front of you? And you didn't say anything?

What are you doing?

>I asked her to subtly drop the hint she had a boyfriend, she got mad and yelled at me saying I never let her have friends. I told her if she promises to drop the boyfriend hint, I'll drop asking about. She agrees, but never follows through.

A ""hint""? Uh, how about explicitly telling him that she has a boyfriend? If she were interested in being friends with this guy, she would want to do that ASAP, so he doesn't get the wrong idea. Follow?

>GF met him and started chatting with him at a meet up. It started around 10, and **they chatted until nearly 2 am**. Not really a huge deal, new friend, new experiences. .

>GF **lied about where she was going** because she was afraid I would be jealous. That's kind of a different story though. They meet up at 3, she comes home around 1 in the morning, so **10 hours together**.

1. She is thinking about fucking him
2. She is fucking him

This sounds like an interpersonal issue. No one is being an asshole. She's allowed to appreciate other people, and you're justified in being annoyed if she does it on a date.

bc4ang,"NTA

I'm also in my late 20's and my dad died when I was young.  His brother, my uncle, had nothing to do with me for 26 years and then when I moved back to my hometown he suddenly triedto be involved.  

I gave it a shot for three years (29 now, almost 30) but at the end of the day, I resent him for not being there and I'm just not really invested in who he is as a person.  So I thought to myself, what would I do if I had a friend I didn't really identify with?  I wouldn't keep that friend, I would let them know I don't think we're compatabile and move on.

So that's what I did with him.  You don't owe your dad a relationship, he didn't try to establish one with you during your childhood.  I can almost guarantee the only reason he's willing to put the effort forth now is that you're grown and he doesn't have to parent you in any manner.  You do what you think is right, but I don't think you'd be in the wrong to cease a relationship with him."
bc4dke,"NTA - But don't bail.  Instead, please go and then stand up and turn your back to him while he speaks.  Bonus points if you hold a little sign ""God is love, not hate.""  or  ""#ImWithPete"" or something."

bc4jvp,YTA.  Your husband was bitten hard enough to be missing a chunk out of his chest.  Dropping whatever attacked him is a normal reaction to *having a chunk bitten out of your chest*.  He didn't intentionally hurt your child.  You owe him an apology for making him feel like a shitty parent for a normal reaction to being harmed.

But other than saying it’s what he’s “passionate” about, is he willing to talk with you about it more in depth? What’s interesting or exciting to him about this pursuit? Does he want to (or does he already) share his art online? Design tattoos? Make hentai? 

Maybe it’ll help you understand it beyond what you see in front of you (sexy lady drawings). Or maybe you’ll find out he’s a fucking weirdo."

If they are in a better place to help you pay this line of credit down then perhaps it can be a conversation, but if you’re comfortable taking care of it on your own I’d say there’s nothing wrong with that.

bc54pb,"NAH ... I don't think you realize how you're coming across. It's not your friends jobs to fix you or your depression. It sounds like they're doing the best they can and you're criticizing them for it. I think it's the depression making you think these things about your friends. That's why I don't think you're an asshole either. I think you're stuck in a cycle. The more depressed you get the more guilt tripy and harder you are to be around which makes people less likely to want to be around you which makes you more depressed.

I think you should try to be really nice to your friends and focus on only saying nice things to them the next 3 times you communicate with them.

I think you should also seek professional help for the depression. You can do counciling over webcam these days. 

Either way I wish you luck on your road back to health :)"

bc61v9,"ESH:   If you're regularly buying groceries together and living together, sometimes someone is going to overconsume something.

Can you pick some up tommorrow?""   Seriously, have you never eaten an entire anything by yourself?  She even made sure to ask if you want any.

Yes, she should have been more considerate, but don't drop the 'we paid for that consumable thing together' unless you want to start dividing boxes of cereal down the middle."

Nobody **wants** to go to a funeral. And a lot of people are a complete wreck when they go to them - it’s expected. I honestly feel like I look bad at a funeral simply because I have trouble expressing emotion that I feel internally and maybe look callous. 

You don’t have to go to most funerals. But if you know someone well or they are really close to you or your immediate family unit it looks really poorly to not attend. I guess that doesn’t matter to some people, and that is fine if you don’t care. But it does absolutely make you selfish."

&yes you were a jerk about it. She wanted you to join her for her trip. You told her you’re going on your yearly trip together whether she comes or not because it’s more important for your trip to be in March than to have your girlfriend with you."

You’re not an asshole for expressing concern about your partner’s health. It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to see a General Practitioner at least once a year (even to draw blood once a year) preferably. That way, you can detect potential cancers or other diseases early.

bc7pci,"YTA but a really, *really* minor one. Gender confirmation at that age is mostly just pronouns and stereotypes, so letting your child play with whatever they want and wear whatever they want is essentially all they need. Why in particular aren't you okay with 5 year old boys wearing dresses? If they enjoy it, where's the harm?

If your child *does* show signs of being transgender, a child psychologist can help you out. The main things to look for are that what they say doesn't change over time, and that it causes them distress. If those two things are true, you need to assess letting your kid transition socially. Sometimes this happens super young - there are records of kids being persistent at 2-3 years old, but that's really rare. 5ish, though, they've already got a good handle on things and it's not uncommon for trans adults to say they knew they were trans from that age.

No one is going to do surgeries on a kid, but in the case of a young kid with multiple years of insistence, they can prescribe kids puberty blockers that give the kid a few extra years for their brains to grow and mature before hormones start doing irreversible things."

bc8vt2,"NTA - as someone who also has a very emotionally/mentally abusive mother (I just cut ties with her last year right before thanksgiving) I understand where you’re coming from. 

If she does go to counseling that’s great! Then MAYBE you guys can have a relationship after she’s been doing it for a while, but you need time to heal and time with her out of your life. Its honestly so draining dealing with it. 

I told my mom 3 years ago almost, she won’t be in my life till she seeks therapy again. She said ok. Has she? No. Until your mom actually does it, don’t take her or your dads word for it tbh. It’s another way for them to keep you around longer with empty promises.

I don't think you should blame yourself too much for his firing because he was being pretty careless about it. If he insists on keeping it secret, that shows he's aware of impropriety of the situation. However, since you did give him your word, you are a bit of an asshole for breaking it.

Also, him not being scheduled doesn't necessarily mean he's fired. It varies from school to school, but on occasion final teaching assignments may not be set right away.

Edit: I'm surprised to see how many people are absolving the professor of all blame. In this case the OP was very mature and considered any implications, but that's not to say future students he meets will be as well.

You did absolutely nothing wrong. Your post indicates that you're an adult, presumably at university living away from home. You have academic obligations to fulfill. You're an adult now and have friends, a boyfriend, x, y and z tasks to do. Your first priority cannot be to dote on your narcissistic and frankly abusive mother, *especially* at the expense of your own mental health.

Or your father going to great expense to install a new expensive heater so they can enjoy a hot shower *in their own house*?  If you think your hot showers are so integral to your mental health then you fucking pay for the heater, you’re a “professional writer” after all.

I know you said they used to talk but again, she isn’t your girlfriend. If she was I’d say ESH since you shouldn’t be controlling and she should respect boundaries if it makes you uncomfortable. Ultimately communication and trust are keys to a healthy relationship."

But you may have expected too much of this friend. In future, I'd suggest you don't confess personal thoughts via text. It is great to have in depth conversations with friends, but this is the kind of conversation best had in person, verbally, where you can take your cue on how much to share based on the body language of the person hearing it. Also, you want to gauge how much personal info to share based on how personal the other person is being with you. It is something learned over time - very few people instinctively grasp this - and I don't want you to decide to never share anything personal again, but you have to learn to judge the time and place. Sometimes texting can feel safer than saying something out loud, but once it is sent you no longer own it and control who sees it. In that sense a verbal in-personal conversation is safer (or an anonymous reddit-type conversation not linked to you).

Please respond to her and clear the air. It's okay for you to feel disappointed and let down, and she clearly is trying to apologize and ensure you know she feels bad.

Some people find these types of fundraising commitments to be easier to say yes to in the abstract past than to follow through with in the present. Learn from this and if you ask her to do something like this again, ensure that she is actually as committed to it as you are.

Not only was it just ridiculous and disrespectful to do something he asked you not to do, to HIS dogs, and to also try and do behind his back, but if he specifically said “they have to learn” and he’s trying to curb that behavior you giving in and rewarding them is just teaching them that they just have to wait X amount of time to get what they want, which is going to disrupt what he’s trying to do. You were super immature and disrespectful."

I needed help. This boy was new in town and had known me for a couple months, and watched my downward spiral. All he did was offer help and a place to stay, driving me around, buying me food, he was basically my new boyfriend. I saw the way he looked at me, I wasn’t naive to it. I felt like scum, because I didn’t feel the same way, but I didn’t have any other options. I needed his help. So I was nice, I helped clean his place, made meals, I knew what I was doing and what he expected but I played dumb. Just needed to buy time until I found something, a job, a place, anything. During this whole thing, I kept making excuses like you are. “Well, he’s offering, it’s not like I’m asking for help.” “He hasn’t asked me out, so it’s not an official thing.” 
Months later, after I pulled myself out of my hole and thought back on it, it just made me hate myself. I was that girl, I used someone. I took advantage of a situation, someone’s feelings for me. Made me feel like scum. I eventually reached out and made amends with him, talked it all out and got the truth that he basically thought we were dating, and it hurt really bad when I beat feet the way I did. 

Trust me when I say, YTA. Have a conversation with this boy before he gets hurt and this goes on too long."

Or alternatively just tell them you won’t be going unless they can fix the booking and won’t be paying her back for booking tickets on dates you did not agree.

They shouldn’t have taken your spot, but your note was definitely a bit overboard. 

Threatening destruction of property is not good from a legal standpoint even if it’s just a hyperbole.  Although the likelihood is slim, if anything were to happen to their car the note would be taken seriously and the blame might end up on you.

In my adult life on average I’d say I go out to eat 1-2 times per week (not as much anymore but definitely way more than that when I was younger). In that time I’ve only left a $0 tip two times. Even though I default to 20% for the bear minimum of “if you show up at my table, provide adequate service and never say a word to me or check up on my table” I still believe that a tip is something that you only get if your customer left content with the way you performed your job (with that said, I separate kitchen mistakes from server attitude). 

It is not on the waitress to decide your upcharges and while I’m sure she gets away with it often because people don’t check their bills her main goal was to increase her tip amount by increasing your check amount. She tried to screw you, she doesn’t get rewarded for that. 

This is on top of the fact that clearly she didn’t care and was unapologetic when caught."

This does not seem mutually exclusive to me. He has the right to ask you to talk to him, and you have the right to refuse. Based on his previous attitude towards you and your family, you have a reasonable reason to refuse to interact with him, however this is irrelevant to your decision.

Maybe just go to him or write him a letter to take with him that says how much you love him, how miuch you miss him when he’s gone, and that you’d like to have a dad and daughter date (or include your other siblings, if you want,) because you want some quality time to talk and make memories with him."

What’s the $2-5 to you, versus the $2-5 to the owner x every guest if they had the same thought process as you. If they’re short staffed to the point the owner is serving tables regularly, it’s probably a sign that they can’t afford to hire more wait staff."

No, you did not ruin the party. At worst you were mildly awkward and messed around with your painting. I can't believe people are saying ESH for painting it over because ""nobody cares how they turn out."" Exactly, and I doubt anybody fucking cared if you painted it over anyway. Nobody would have given a shit unless *he* had made a scene and drawn attention to it.

Yes, you should get therapy to address your anxiety issues, but given that he is refusing to help you and it sounds like you are financially dependent on him, this is *his* fault.

Later he apologized for harping on the issue at the studio and said he should have just left me alone. But my outbursts are a big burden on him and are stressful.

You are not an asshole for questioning those decisions especially since it sounds like her financial burdens will become your own.

It's time to help him develop a life plan.  While he is 19, that doesn't mean it is too early for him to get some lessons.  You need to break down what everything costs.

If he wants it, work. The video games go next.  Take the card off the account.  If he wants games to play or wants to keep playing online, then he needs to work for it.  Next is the phone.  This is where it gets tricky.  You want him to have meaningful employment, then employers need to get a hold of him.  He can either pick up his own plan or get a shitty cheap flip phone.

  You went clubbing as your gf's date and spent most of the time hanging out with her touchy, flirty friend?  That's... not cool.   Is it possible that you were flirting back with this girl?  Based on how you spent your time it sounds like you're kind into this girl but genuinely don't know it."
bd18s8,"NAH

As their son you're totally right for being worried about them, but you also can't make decisions for them, despite how unnecessary and wasteful they seem to you. It sucks that they're potentially going towards financial issues, but it's going to be difficult to convince them that they are making poor choices if it involves something they believe in spiritually. Have you talked to them specifically about being worried in regards to their finances? It may just be something that you need to let go if they won't listen."
bd1a1l,**NTA.**    I have to confess that I'm probably an asshole for giggling at her passive-aggressive song choice.      **Sounds like she was baiting you for an argument.**  Glad you didn't give her the satisfaction.  What a twat.
bd1ee2,"NTA - don’t let him ruin your prom. In 20 yrs, 10 yrs, hell 5 yrs, none of this will matter."
bd1hzd,"YTA for making your girlfriend jump through hoops. Just give her the link, she can report it, the mods can ignore it if the post doesn't break sub rules. You didn't have to make it harder for her just for the principle of the thing."
bd1in2,"NTA. Clearly NTA. He agreed to go, to pay cash and bailed last minute.  He's going to anger his whole group of friends over £7?  Not only is he an asshole, but short-sighted."
bd1kcn,NTA.    Sounds shady.  Even if it *is* legit curtly demanding personal details isn't appropriate.
bd1kwh,"NTA she is going to break your agreement also I hate this ""she told me to man up"""
bd1o54,"NAH. There are tangible legal benefits to getting married, i.e. taxes, etc. Do your personal objections to marriage outweigh the financial, medical, and/or legal benefits?  Presumably you are dedicated to one another, live in the same household, and have children together; you’re effectively married in all but name.  The rational that you don’t want to get married because it’s “just a piece of paper” is pretty weak. If it’s just a piece of paper, then why not do it?"
bd1pez,NTA. Stop enabling them. Are they toddlers? Why can't they carry keys?
bd1qvf,YWBTA. It's one day a year. One day where you show up and make nice to make your sister happy. It's not a hard ask. And you will need her support someday. Don't alienate her by skipping out on parties she wants you at.
bd1ta3,"NTA

It sounds like that he will just cause problems."
bd1w0s,"NTA, but grow some backbone and stop entertaining this toxic and manipulative dude! If you keep being a doormat, he will keep walking all over you. Definitely suggest hard block on all social media and cut communication with him altogether."
bd1zj4,NTA- I always felt there was a reason teachers did shitty group projects. And I think it’s to teach the hard workers that there will always be leeches. And to teach how to GET RID of leeches. Don’t let these fools take credit for YOUR work
bd25ws,"NAH, obviously I couldn't hear her inflection or anything, but just at face value that doesn't sound at all like she was implying you were wrong to leave early"
bd2684,"NAH, but you’re acting childish. Just because you work together doesn’t mean you’re entitled to an invite to their outings. You complain about “acting like adults”, but wanna throw a fit over your coworkers treating it like kindergarten where everyone has to be included? Cmon."
bd29t1,"ESH - you should do it for your neices/nephews. If the mother is really that terrible, it would be nice if they had other family they knew they could rely on."
bd2a76,NTA even though it’s looked down open you’re not forced to tip because without customers there’d be no restaurant at all really
bd2ao1,NTA and so never host a party  again for them because they don't respect your home nor you.
bd2dri,NTA.  He's acting unstable and gave you reason to be worried.  You did the right thing.
bd2k3i,"NTA. you do you, it's not a big deal"
bd2mk1,"NTA.

They chose to sit behind someone that was 6’8”, then got all shockedpikachu.jpg when you were tall."
bd2p5f,NTA but I’m incredibly sad your best friend is being forced to marry against her will just to appease her parents and family. They’re fucking horrible people.
bd2pxg,"ESH 

She sucks for not joining you or allowing you to go.

You suck for the way you talk about her...it was HER fault you missed the DJ last time because SHE wanted to spend NYE together....if my bf didn't want to spend NYE together I'd dump him : B

You both have issues."
bd2r7d,Lets hope you wont find yourself in their shoes as technology advances and your experience becomes irrelevant. You do sound kinda cocky so I'm leaning towards YTA
bd2r9g,"Edit: based on OPs edit gonna go with NTA for this one. If you can, move the router into one of your rooms. If she can't pay for it she (and her boyfriend) shouldn't get to use it. And if she continues to not pay you might have a case to have her removed from the lease. 

INFO did you try to talk to sandy about her lack of payments"
bd2tka,"NTA, but people are sensitive. If asked, just say you're happy with yourself as you are. You don't have to go into why."
bd2ux6,"YTA, I could get that you’re upset that She isn’t really spending time with you, but you aren’t entitled to it and schema’s allowed to see her boyfriend whenever She wants and as often as She wants. If you feel lonely, maybe get a pet?"
bd31wv,"NTA

She's not being a good friend and it sounds like you communicated directly and fairly. You didn't name call or shit talk; you just addressed the very real issue of her wanting everything on her terms and giving nothing and no shits about anyone."
bd33je,NAH- honestly your wife might just be a badass. Who TF just smashes a scorpion like that lol. I don't consider myself a pussy or anything but I would definitely use a shoe or more to kill it
bd34e9,"NTA. You're on the hook for $16k debt; she isn't. If she is ghosting you, you have no choice but to get ahold of her probation officer and failing that, the police. 

I would say whatever happens (even if you two patch things up for example) you must get the car back, and consider selling it to clear as much of the debt as possible. You'd be mad to keep up such an informal but serious financial relationship like this, as you're the only one who loses if she doesn't keep her side of the bargain (your credit record, your obligation to pay the debt even if she totals the car etc)."
bd35ym,"NTA. No issue if she can’t/doesn’t want to drive you. However, don’t tell someone you can and then decide you can’t."
bd394g,"NTA

No one likes unsolicited advice. Can you tell her you can't afford to shop with her as much? To avoid as much interaction?"
bd39xa,"NAH.  There are a lot of things that go into people's determinations of authority, including age, gender, posture, clothing, etc.  You can both be right in this situation, and probably are.  I think she is right that you don't understand the nonsense that women go through in that regard.  It's not hard to imagine that the 10,000th time you get overlooked in that way, you just might start to see a pattern.  Does that mean she can read the mind of the homeowner?  No.  Does it mean that she is justified in her belief?  Yes."
bd3ffk,"Nta. If you're casting for a black character for a movie, you would obviously pick a black actor/actress. I don't see how this is any different personally.

I could be an asshole too though, and am open to responses as well."
bd3j2c,"Nta. Hotels, Airbnb or rental property exists. You have already been more than accomodating."
bd3jpf,"NTA - your GF is TA though. If no one had ever ""stirred the pot"" by advocating for positive (but initially unpopular) change, your GF wouldn't be able to vote or own property.

It'd be one thing if she disagreed with the petition on its face, but saying you should just go along with the crowd regardless of your actual opinion is wrong and immature.

Edited to add: so... this blew up. Cool. Also, to clarify, I purposefully did not weigh in on the balloon issue. My point is that opposing anything--no matter how big or small--just because it ""stirs the pot"" is TA move. That's not a reason. That's cowardice."
bd3jq4,"NTA- give his parents back whatever money they've given you and plan a wedding you want with your parents' gift. (Or elope as you suggest elsewhere!)

This is definitely a case of ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes."" They want to get their way because they gave, $$. Give them their $$ back. 

Do not let them ransom your wedding."
bd3lmh,"NTA.

It sounds like you’ll need an extension at best and it sounds like he’ll purposely put it off enough that you’ll have to do his part. Reporting this is necessary for you to do well."
bd3qxe,"I was beginning to think I was crazy/the only person who understood that ""bylaws"" are the bare minimum - not the standard for being considered a decent/kind roommate or friend to the people you actually live with!"
bd3rs3,"NTA for sending them, and addressing their lateness/your faux pas. 

YWBTA for not sending them at all."
bd3rsm,NTA you should always take antibiotics as prescribed and one pill would not help her even if she had a bacterial infection.
bd3sbd,"NTA. That’s gross. If you aren’t allowed to smoke somewhere, then you shouldn’t vape their either."
bd3wc2,YTA.  You know you are too and you came here for validation because you're trying to justify not doing it.
bd40c2,NTA you are allowed to decide who you associate with in person and via chat.
bd45r6,"NAH. 

You have no proof and even if it was their cats, what do you expect your neighbour to do about it? Get some of those solar powered, cat repelling things for your flower beds."
bd49n1,"NTA. food safety is extremely important, ESPECIALLY for those in higher risk groups (being very old is one of these risks). hell, i’m young&healthy and got food poisoning a few months ago and it put me in the ER for the weekend and i was life threateningly dehydrated as a result. don’t eat ANYTHING you don’t think has been cooked or stored properly and don’t be afraid to be vocal about it"
bd49pf,"It sounds like he was mad at your attitude with his child and not the fact that you wouldn't go in the water. You have to have a lot of patience with children and you might have been unnecessarily mean once you got annoyed. 

Of course, you're NTA for not wanting to go in the water."
bd4b5b,YTA. You were willing to abort the baby but not let your family members raise him/her? Damn.
bd4d3u,"NTA - but if your GF is getting this upset over cooking, something else is going on between you and you all need to have adult communication."
bd4eva,YWBTA.  Stay out of it.  All you’ll do is stir the pot.   This fussing on your part isn’t going to make him magically go “hmm you’re right! 🤔”.
bd4hoy,"YTA adults have more responsibilities than “bro codes”

They don’t expect you to actually do that shit especially since it was such a stupid bet."
bd4ihy,"YTA, you could have left a couple dollars (depending on how much your bill was, for not attentive service like 5% tip, since 15% is for good service) since you knew many of the issues ere things she didn't have control of. Also YTA for only ever tipping $3 when you go out to eat. If you don't want to tip then eat at home. I could see not leaving anything if she was rude or all of your issues were her fault but it sounds like she was trying"
bd4kyx,"NTA. It’s a bad idea to marry someone who’s so financially irresponsible. Your fiancé needs to demonstrate the ability to handle this stuff, and is failing so far.

Edit: maybe explain it to him like that. It’s not you trying to micromanage his finances, it’s you wanting to feel confident that he’s not gonna put you both in debt when you’re married. Don’t let him brush that off. People’s financial habits don’t change that easily or without concentrated effort."
bd4obd,NTA. You were being kind. Who doesn’t clean their teeth before a bootycall?
bd4ron,NTA for initially sending her the article. You will be the asshole if you continue to belabor it.
bd4sd3,"YTA - She wants people to see the win. She's not posting it to shame you, she's posting it to show the team winning."
bd4t57,NTA - fuck those kids
bd4u01,"NTA. It is so rude to just cancel and not give anyone a heads up. I would say it's a valuable teaching moment for them too, but it seems like the other mom totally missed the point."
bd4v32,"NTA. You're essentially renting a room, if your landlord (stepdad) doesn't want anything resembling a gun on his property he should've sat down and talked to you about it instead of basically stealing it. Definitely talk to your mom about this, it's her house too."
bd4vc5,"NAH. It would be weird to leave something already opened, although it’s also  weird to bring something that’s already open. Just make it clear that the sparkling wine is the gift, and maybe even explain why you brought the other one."
bd4wdc,"NTA, your shitty family is just mad you put their shitty behavior in the spotlight. I would tweet again ""my shitty aunt won't be at the party after all. Anxiety gone."""
bd50zz,[deleted]
bd598h,NAH. Up to you in the end whether to be the bigger person and help someone in need or cut her off after her attitude during your vacation.
bd5an6,ESH. The 'k bye' and 'don't push it' messages show a bit of an attitude but you overreacted about a few forks. Taking her phone seems a bit dramatic.
bd5dpd,"ESH - This is far too much unnecessary drama.  The liar sucks.  But you repeating a lie about your dead friend just makes the lie more highly publicized, even though your intent was to shame the original liar.  Ignore."
bd5dz4,"NAH 

Maybe you two can compromise and have her middle name be your wifes grandmother's name. My mother did that with me"
bd5e4z,"NTA. 

It doesn’t matter how petty or dumb they think it is. You spent 8 hours on something and they ruined it. 

Imagine if your boyfriend spent 8 hours on a video game and you decided to delete his save file. Or he worked 8 hours on a painting and you threw it away. It doesn’t matter what it is."
bd5e65,"NAH. 

You aren’t the assholes for not wanting to go. You have no obligation to go. 

I don’t think they are the assholes for expecting you to come either. They might be for the general racism, though."
bd5ek5,"NAH honestly.
Pregnant women tend to clean a LOT. It's a behavior called nesting. She needs everything to be just right and comfortable for when little one comes. Just grin and bear it and you'll be okay. Understand it's her horomones changing and her body changing that are causing this. Other users will probably have better advice then I do tbh."
bd5iwv,"That’s not how it works though- a teacher can’t push back an AP exam, those are given through the company."
bd5j7h,NTA. This is only because 1) she specifically said that she was better than you and 2) you had to find out through someone else instead of directly from your boyfriend.
bd5nyl,NTA - If when ordering you selected to the door they have to honor that. What if you guys were disabled and or injured in which getting down stairs is difficult? So that itself makes the delivery person the ass because they have no idea what the situation could be.
bd5pf9,"NTA

If she isn't filing tax returns, then she is breaking the law and she should be reported. Simple as that."
bd5txg,"NTA. Who the hell marches in to someone else’s house and rearranges it to their liking, that ISN’T on HGTV? That’s rude as hell."
bd5yqs,NTA - You can hang out with whomever you please.
bd60fv,"NTA. Backseat driving is the worst & can be dangerous. Tell him if he wants a ride; stfu or drive himself. If you have passed your test, you have evidenced your ability to drive."
bd6czu,NTA just tell him you'll make it to the next one
bd6elb,"NAH, while it may hurt some to only have you in their life a short time others may be grateful for the chance to reconnect with you before your gone."
bd6fed,"you are not the asshole...but it is your brother and if its his birthday, you should support him...any other time, feel free to just tell him your not interested and go about doing you"
bd6ig0,">In this fight I told him how ridiculous it is to argue about the money in a videogame like its a serious matter,

And yet you argued just as much if not more. If it's such a minor issue, why not just concede the point and move on?"
bd6lio,"NAH - You are allowed to set boundaries in your relationship, but realize that she doesn’t share your point of view.  You might see it as she is flirting with a sexual encounter and she could simply see it as risqué fun with friends.  

I would be more worried that you brought up a concern and she summarily dismissed it."
bd6md6,"NAH. 

It was an accident, maybe buy her flowers to make up for the mishap if you really wanna *wow* her. 

Or ask her on an official date and joke about making sure you’ll remember your wallet this time."
bd6mee,NTA You're doing a good thing for her and whether you want to keep on doing it is your decision
bd6nyh,Let the friends that payed somke don’t let the ones that didn’t
bd6opm,"NTA, they should take some responsibility and clean up the messes that they make in common areas. ""They need to soak"" is a shitty excuse to not do your dishes, and I've heard it from every single bad roommate I've ever had."
bd6pc1,"NTA - even if she doesn't know ""all about birds"", how does she think screaming every time the bird so much as moves will be anything but bad? Plus, she shouldn't be offended when you tell her off for doing something that is potentially harmful to your birds.

&#x200B;

 If she's afraid of birds to the point of screaming, she needs to just not go over to your house, or, at the very least, not remain in a room where you have your bird(s) out."
bd6qt0,"NTA-  I understand feeling defensive over your husband - at the same time, your husband is an adult and he should be able to invite his friend if he wants."
bd6quq,"NAH. You seem considerate, and like you genuinely do have his interests at heart. 

I had a colleague who was the same. Then one day he stopped smelling. A few months later we were chatting about constructive comments, and it turns out that a manager had had a word with him. It was embarrassing for a bit, but ultimately he was grateful."
bd6rkj,ESH - yelling at coworkers is in appropriate and borderline bullying. You’d be better of speaking to them and getting them to better understand how they can help you.  If this doesn’t work then approach your superior or their superior for assistance about their job performance as they may need retraining.
bd6uga,"NAH. You're really aware of how to help your mental health, and you're insightful into what would bring you down. You could explain that you're taking a break from social media, but tbh you don't have to explain yourself. Your mental health is more important, and I'm sure your friends would understand if they knew"
bd6wsg,"NTA

There is a reason youtube had to disable the comment section on all videos featuring kids..."
