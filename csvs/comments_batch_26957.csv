bd6xq1,NTA. Dude can say no if he doesn’t want to help. He’s a grown man.
bd74l2,"NTA I know how hard it is to hold your tongue after someone does something like that to you. As long as you bring it up in a calm, collected way, no matter how angry, you should be alright. I hope she realizes all of this and slowly backs off from her friend due to toxicity, but good luck"
bd76ni,"NTA. Not only is she controlling, but she’s also a pedo. Don’t apologize to her OP"
bd78nm,NTA. Don’t dish it if you can’t take it
bd7b1v,"NTA for accepting the job if you did if you wanted to. NTA for not accepting the job either, since you didn’t want it, but those friends of yours are acting kind of catty about the whole thing"
bd7bws,NTA it sucked for making her feel bad but the feedback to her bist might get her more support if it's too much mess for just her to handle
bd7fkl,"NTA but to be honest I’m sure she wouldn’t want to attend her ex’s family wedding. However if they do get back together, you might want to be prepared to flip the invite back."
bd7isl,"NAH you should just mention it to her, she probably doesn’t realize you can hear her that much."
bd7j72,"NAH.  Funerals are for the living.  Will it give you a sense of closure? I bet your friend would want you to have a good time.  A lot of people forget to check in on families after some time passes.  If his mom is up to it, she might like having dinner together soon.  You could send them a meal or a gift card for delivery and a condolence card for now.  

I'm sorry for your loss."
bd7jpd,"Why not just talk to her and be like yo, you need to be more quiet about that and tell them to wear clothes when they’re out of her area?"
bd7lb1,"ESH (besides the 3rd guy) if you do.

You screwing over the other guy makes you no better than the other two who are already dead weight. Either see if 3rd guy also wants to give up, tell the teacher about the two dead weights, or suck it up and work on the project the best you can. 

The moment you screw over an innocent 3rd party you become an asshole. Even if other's wronged you first."
bd7num,"NTA - From my understanding of it was your money and he didn't transfer it straight away, then proceeded to yell at you (his customer). 
Based on this I would consult your partner first since they have some Freindship with the accountant.

It is still pretty shocking that he would yell at you especially when your in that tense of a situation. 
(In Australia we have free health care). 

So basically yes I would fire him but first consult your partner's."

bd7u3b,"YTA

Sorry mate. I think you should have stood up for your brother. The prospect of losing a relationship with both of you might have convinced your parents to actually reevaluate their stances on this. I'm not unsympathetic to your financial difficulties, but it's not OK."
bd7v0y,"YTA. ""I don't think this thing I enjoy should be translated so the masses can enjoy it"" is elitist as hell."
bd7v58,"I don’t understand, if you paid in cash how did it keep going after it reached the $20? It should have stopped automatically at whatever amount the cashier put in.

Edit: NTA from what you’ve said it sounds like a machine malfunction or human error on the cashier’s part. You shouldn’t be held accountable for their mistake."
bd7xxs,"This is so YTA that it has to be a shitpost.  You're not entitled to his GI bill.  I'm sorry you've had a tough life, but you're not entitled to paid college or anything extra from him unless it's backpay for child support.  If you want a GI funded education, feel free to enlist."
bd8ays,"NTA.  Go and have fun at your reunion.  Send a gift to the shower.  Its April now, you have a life, and made plans.  A shower is easier to move than a ten year reunion"
bd8bho,"Short-term: YTA. 

But more importantly, long-term: NTA. It's a dick move tbh, but it's a valuable lesson they should learn sooner than later to never let anyone do the thinking for them."
bd8d4a,NTA. Sounds like she has been asking for it and it was a long time coming.
bd8grq,"NTA, if the other boyfriend can visit on occasion so can yours. That’s a clear double standard."
bd8gsc,"NTA. You didn’t say anything derogatory against anyone else and shared a reasonable opinion. I wouldn’t worry about it, especially since your friends were fine with it."
bd8lhb,"NAH for not being comfortable going there.

She wouldn't be the asshole for being disappointed.  Continuing to lie about the reason will likely cause problems and could make you the asshole at some point."
bd8nuj,YTA because obviously you don't know 1) not go on Facebook via your own free will and 2) shut Facebook notifications off.
bd8o6h,"NTA 

Sounds to me like everyone assumed someone else told you. That’s not your fault and they shouldn’t act like it was. 

Plus I can guarantee you that kid doesn’t even remember. Even if she did, she can GTF over it. Kids aren’t entitled to winning BC they’re young"
bd8vps,"NTA- Your father is actually using a line that I find to be a red flag. The “ after all I/we/she/he have done for you” is an extremely manipulative way of guilt tripping a person into feeling like you’re the one doing wrong no matter the situation. 
In this case, your mother was distracting you and keeping you from driving carefully. At which point, you were justified in snapping. Maybe you feel bad about telling them to shut up but it wasn’t meant to be disrespectful or to be unprompted. 
Having been in that situation I understand what it’s like. I would actually advise not to let it get to you because this is a tactic people to do to make you bad about something based on things that have no relevance to the situation. How your mother has treated you all her life has no bearing on how distracting she was in the car."
bd8x4a,"YTA. No you can’t always be there for every girl. But you can be there for this girl. You know he is abusive and you’re willing to let a girl get physically and emotionally battered because you just don’t want to get involved. People not wanting to get involved is a huge reason abuse continues. You have no idea if this is going to be the girlfriend he finally beats to death. You don’t know if, should she decide to finally leave the abuse, he finally snaps and goes after not just her but her family and friends which plenty of abusers have done in the past. 
You absolutely have an obligation to do good for others. We all do. You can’t force her to believe you and you can’t physically drag her away but you can do everything in your power to warn her and try to save her from abuse. Those who stand idly by and do nothing when others are being hurt are honestly no better than the abuser. You’re still passively contributing to the abuse by knowing it’s happening and choosing to do nothing."
bd8xai,"NTA. 

What's your roommate's problem? You live there too, and you share the space. It's unreasonable of him to expect that he gets sole power on deciding what is and is not okay to leave in the shared living space."
bd8z1s,NTA but dry weddings suck for the guests.
bd8zia,"NTA

Saying ""oh you don't seem the type"" is ridiculous. It doesn't hurt to ask even if you expect the answer to be no, because if they say no then there's no change and at least the other person knows you offered and feels included. Making assumptions about how you wouldn't want to go out isn't how you should act."
bd901b,"YTA for generalizing, NTA for moving if someone smells."
bd986q,"NTA

i think that she should have introduced you especially since you didnt really know anyone. it probably just didnt cross her mind but i think that she should have been more aware of you. not everyone thinks that way though so it might not be a big deal to her. maybe just talk to her and get her to see that if it was the other way around she would be feeling awkward and not great. 
not the asshole at all"
bd9ai3,NTA. Based on your description of events your clothes and your person smelled because you were extremely ill for most of the week. Just because she has cancer doesn't mean she gets to be a dick because you were also sick.
bd9c1m,"NTA ...you aren't and will never be the asshole for taking a break for video games to engage in real life interaction, especially with family. 

Real life > internet/video games.  Always."
bd9dgk,"ESH, what a silly hill for both of y'all to die on."
bd9g03,"YTA. Not being friends with her anymore was your choice, but ghosting her without warning? You didn’t have to do that. Also, “if she was acting out like this in the 8th grade and her mom was still alive I still would've cut her off but probably would've done it nicer” you would’ve been nicer to her if her mom HADN’T died? This seems totally backwards to me. You did her a favor by not being her friend anymore, tbh, it doesn’t sound like you cared about her in the first place."
bd9htz,"ESH you're being pretentious as fuck after being healthy for a couple months, you're taking out payday loans to feed yourself and threatening to starve your children if your wife doesn't bend to your demands. She sucks for not trying but carbs are cheap, it's likely the only things she knows how to cook and doesn't have the money to experiment with new things. She should try, but your like 80% asshole, she's only 20%."
bd9kta,ESH- not saying you’re an ass for not going to Walmart but the way you handled it could have been better. And you’re gf is definitely in the wrong for pestering you and her final comment before leaving. Enjoy your day off OP.
bd9t2f,"NTA 

Your family are cunts. Sorry you had to deal with that"
bd9uuf,NTA but I have to ask what the hell is in the rice causing it? Plain white rice shouldn’t be rotting and leaving putrid smells like that.
bd9yb6,NTA but your friend sure is
bda48f,"NTA. 


Good friends offer FULL price when asking for professional work from other friends and then it's up to the discretion of the professional to accept less than full price."
bda4pd,NTA. 2 hrs is much too far for a daily commute. Hopefully they can see that it’s not personal; it’s practical.
bda6v6,"NTA. Your brothers *were* the assholes, but are no longer assholes in talking about the stories if they don't think their antics actually caused you harm and you haven't told them they have. I *do* think it would be healthy for you to sit down with them and actually talk to them and tell them how much you were affected by how you were treated by them growing up. How their actions still deeply affect you and you don't appreciate them making light of it. Now, if you're plotting some kind of revenge or way to get back at them, ***don't.*** You're not going to feel better at the end of it, it will ruin any chance you have at building a healthy relationship with them for the future, and at the end of the day everyone's just going to see you as the asshole."
bdaada,NTA. Tell them you're jerking off and guaranteed they'll stop barging in lmao
bdacc3,NTA he was being a complete asshole and you don't want a repeat of that and you have a right not to invite him if you don't want to
bdae4o,"NTA. Go to HR and report your superior, they're clearly trying to take this out on you."
bdagjr,You’re asking if having sex with a drunk married person makes you an asshole? Really?
bdahc5,"NTA. She ignored a clear and reasonable request from you and then initially declined to pay for the consequence. However, it may have been better to take the headphones out yourself or at least tell your mom why she shouldn't put your clothes in the laundry yet. Maybe she would've been more considerate."
bdakkr,"YTA.  Come crawling back to you? Wtf? Who cares if she's moving, he's spending time with her while he can. If you don't want to hang out with him, fine.  But he gets to choose how he spends his time, not you."
bdaodv,"YTA ""dropping hints"" what are you 12? talk to her like an adult, your reasons for firing may be fine, but the way you handle it is awful. You could've talked with her, like an adult, but no you ""dropped hints"", leaving this caring parent with an ill person on his family without a job. Maybe if you had talk with her, she could've look for a new job, but all of the sudden she lost her job without any proper notice"
bdaq3e,"YTA what even is this... i thought at first NTA bc she was just being forgetful and it’s annoying, but now that I realize this was done maliciously... you’re the asshole here.

You should never try and trick someone into having kids with you. 

if your wife doesn’t want kids until she’s out of school and you don’t respect that, you don’t respect her. Making sure you’re protected is both of your responsibilities."
bdaubx,"NTA, the markup on fish is big and many stores could care less if there are losses. Unfortunately the fish suffer.  Betas happen to be some of the most abused as well as hermit crabs."
bdavod,"NTA, funerals are for the living. If they are not useful for your grieving process, that's okay."
bdaxo7,NTA. As the driver she is responsible for maintaining awareness at all times. That's part of getting your license.
bdb1c4,NTA. It was your seat and you have the right to sit in it. She wasn’t an asshole for asking but was for being rude to you for saying no.
bdb68r,NTA - listen to your mom on this issue. But don't take relationship advice from her. Staying with a grown up who throws tantrums is questionable behavior. Your dad is TA.
bdba9w,"NTA.

It's legal.

Would you be the AHole for smoking a cigar or cigarette? For drinking beer? For grilling meat?

It's YOUR backyard. You do you."
bdbatn,"NAH if you phrase it a little more kindly than “you need to get rid of her.” That implies he did something wrong, which he didn’t. I would say something like, “I know they were completely unsolicited, but the photos that girl sent made me feel very uncomfortable. Can you block her number? It would mean a lot to me.”"
bdbb7v,"NTA it would be different if she wanted to see the grandkids (as our grands do for our kids) but that’s to being a judge mental jerk. Sounds like a natural consequence to me. Especially picking at your kid, not cool."
bdbcyf,"NTA

As a good reliable worker, you probably have more clout there than you realize.  Don't belittle your coworkers' problems.  That's treading into asshole territory.

Instead, discuss the relevant parts of the equation with your manager... be slightly dispassionate about the personal stuff and come across as mostly just worried about the workplace.

Also, as a good worker, you should be looking to move up... either within the company or to a better position/employer somewhere else.  These guys are never going to amount to much, but you can."
bdbd18,"NAH *if* you’re showing your sons equal love and your eldest isn’t exhibiting behaviors showing that he thinks you love the other baby more, especially if your eldest is 5/6/7."
bdbfct,"NAH - This is very common in relationships but sucks so much nonetheless. As hard as it might be, you need to schedule sex.  You need to make it a priority.  If her libido is low so she doesn’t want to have sex, then you are turning her advances down because you don’t want to have sex with her if she’s just doing it out of guilt all that means is no sex.  It an important part of many relationships is physical intimacy and sometimes it needs a little jump start even if means feeling a little awkward."
bdbiee,"YTA. You're throwing up all kinds of flags. ""They got too close to each other for my liking but I dealt with it"" what does this even mean? You want people to not like each other because it might... mean less attention for you? What? And then asking people not to talk to people due to your insecurity? You give ultimatums but she ""made"" you give one? 

Not even gonna go past the first paragraph as the rest is you going on about how you're justified in your controlling behavior. She doesn't need ""justifications"" for hanging out with whoever she wants. And you're very dishonest; you give ultimatums and then say ""I'm not like that"". WTF. Yes you are. And you blame others for doing ugly things. 

""If you're TRULY my friend then you naturally won't be friends with this person"" is a petty and toxic. No one needs to prove themselves to you."
bdbipq,"For starters, you're dumb as a brick if you go to a lesser college just because you want to have fun. 

Second, you're dumb as a truckload of bricks if you pay more to go to a lesser college. 

College is an investment you make on yourself. I understand if you mention extracurricular activities, a chance for interpersonal growth, etc. But  ""having a blast""? Sounds like a waste of a great chance. 

And third... yes, probably YTA."
bdbojo,"NTA and if you want to ask her but no assholey, just say, 'hey, this summer we're getting season passes, I'd be happy to take your crotch fruit along with me if you were thinking about getting passes also. xoxox' 
Just make it sounds like your doing her a huge favour."
bdbpk3,"YTA. You have unresolved issues with your parents that need to be dealt with. This has nothing to do with her, you are projecting your issues onto her."
bdbqs8,NTA. It’s ok to have conflicting feelings. This may not be really helpful to you but I need to point out that this sounds like a toxic work environment.
bdbt3n,"NTA- I wouldn’t make it due immediately, but it’s a good time to make a plan for repayment now. Maybe something once he’s graduated and working? If he’s a decent guy, he’ll be looking to repay anyways."
bdbu1z,"YTA-

Read your title aloud very slowly, but stop after the word “people.” Rinse and repeat until you understand"
bdbzue,NTA. Good on you for standing by your mother.
bdc46a,"YTA. You made a commitment to this girl, just suck it up and go."
bdc6hl,"NTA - You’re the parent, you deserve this time to spend with your child and your wife. This seems very reasonable to me. Good luck as a new parent!"
bdc7pg,"NTA, at the end of the day your grade is on the line and having them ruin that for you is not okay. 

You need to talk to them and get them to pull their weight so you can do well in your class. Be stern when criticizing them, but don’t attack them or it’s likely nothing positive will come from this. You need to let them know you want everyone to succeed and in order for that to happen, they all need to work with you."
bdc7tb,"NTA. If this is a dorm, ask the dorm master for a new room... for your roomate."
bdccdy,"NTA And fuck that cashier for enabling that behavior, now shes just gonna do it all the time if she isnt already"
bdcglp,"NAH. You two have different perspectives in this situation. You have a new and exciting prospect that happens to take you away from your girlfriend for a bit. She has a boyfriend that is excited to be doing something that takes him (you) away from her. 

Different perspective means different emotions means tension that's not being handled well, but the misalignment isn't a result of poor behavior."
bdcjaj,"NTA  
  
At this point you wouldn't be an asshole if you didn't go because what's the point if you're gonna get steam rolled or ignored for negligible reasons by her and her mother.  
  
You wouldn't be an asshole if you set the boundary that it's just you two. Your girlfriend's mom doesn't need to be there. You're both adults and should form your own opinions on this kind of thing.  
Sure she can ask for advice on it from her mom, but it's ridiculous that she's gone to so many apartment viewings, and the advice needs to be a grain of salt type deal- not a be all end all.  
And, I have a close relationship with my mom. A lot of times it is to my detriment, and a lot of times I do need to suck it up and leave mommy behind.  
Time for gf to do the same.  
  
And as far as a deadline goes. I'd say go for it. She probably won't be happy, but she needs to get her ass in gear because those negligible reasons are just excuses.  
  
Maybe have a serious sit down talk and really see if there are deeper issues because it sounds like she's hesitant and it could be for a reason that should be discussed now instead of after moving in together.  
  
Edit: typos"
bdcjw3,NAH. How could you return it if he's blocked you? If you're going out of your way to keep it then the situation is different
bdclxl,NAH your bf doesn't seem upset and seems to share similar concerns.
bdcn5b,NTA.  This isn't a game I would want to play either.  There is a risk to it and I fully understand the reasons of why you would be against it.
bdcp50,"NAH since you want the best for both the cat and your mom, but you might want to reevaluate your mom’s wishes. Discuss the possibility with her. Don’t just assume you know what’s best."
bdcrix,"ESH - are you joking? You might have deluded yourself into thinking you did this for someone else,  you did that for you. Everyone involed with this is a massive a-hole, end of story"
bdcsl0,NAH there's something much deeper going on. Please OP make sure your wife is okay.
bdctdr,"ESH combind with NTA. Since you start off as an asshole and end it by not being one. She starts off not being an asshole and ends up being one.  
You dont have to be friends with anyone, being nasty to them is the asshole thing. You tried to apologys and all that, but she ended up being nasty to you.  
Good on you for growing and seeing your mistakes.  
Just let it end, not all people are meant to be friends."
bdctod,"NTA - If they have the money for a new car they have the money for a one-day rental. Toxic family member trying to make you feel bad for valuing your own time. I’ll admit when I saw it was for waxing I was like cmon, but seeing the reason for it, it’s more than understandable."
bdcwlm,"YTA. I think the way you tell this story vs the way it must have actually happened was probably very different. For her to react in that way, I’d say you would have delivered the joke in a pretty bad way. Also sexist jokes aren’t really all that funny man, women face enough shit without it being joked about by their partners.

If this story is told right however, then ESH."
bdcwoz,"NTA - Better to exchange it and get something that will be used. You have used it and loved it and now you dont, thats more then fine. Just be nice about it and they should understand"
bdcz8g,"NAH: Your team know that they voted for you. Be smart about it though, instead of building suspense, be like ""The next award is X and you guys have foolishly decided to award it to me, I totally don't deserve it for X, Y and Z reasons, but thanks you guys."""
bdd4a7,"NTA I think it's very reasonable of you to say you think they're gross but if your *daughter* (not your wife) really wanted to go to one you'd go for her.  I think it's a little weird that your wife got so worked up about it, and that seems like something you two will need to work out between you. 

Anyway, here I go image searching ""purity ball"" to creep myself out before I go to bed, thanks"
bdd4gk,"NAH. Your server, your rules."
bdd7ws,"NTA.

Fundamentally he betrayed your confidences to his then-girlfriend (who then spread this information) and he’s only interested in being around you when he’s single (read: when he feels he has no better alternative).

He sounds exhausting and he’s not worth the investment of your time. I would find it very hard to trust him also. He’s made his bed and he has to lie in it."
bddb2j,"NTA: 

Its really not cool for them to smoke in your room. The rest wouldn't bother me though."
bddc81,"NTA, but have you consulted with the other members of the house? You shouldn’t be the only one pressuring him to pay his rent, and if the other roommates agree with letting him stay you should split the rent between yourselves rather than you having to take up the financial burden on yourself"
bddevf,"YTA. Gay people can and do get married and have kids. Even if they were straight they don't owe you grandchildren.

It was wrong of you to impose your wishes on your sons."
bddg3v,"We are civil to her. However, we are not changing our entire joke-set or attitude because of her. More than half our jokes are insults to each other with some of the most crude stuff we can say. We aren't changing our entire dynamic for one person when they have the option to just not be in discord."
bddh4b,"NAH provided you were polite.

If I'm not wrong, I don't even think 13 year olds are supposed to be seated in the exit row? Since those passengers can have an important role to play in the event of an evacuation, they want them to be adults.

If you wanted to go the extra mile you could have asked a flight attendant if anything could be done but it isn't your responsibility to do so."
bddh84,"YTA obviously my guy, just apologize. ""the type of person you are"" isn't an excuse, that type of person can be asshole."
bddmze,"ESH you got to check rental laws in NZ so that you are complying with the law when you evict him.  There are often regulated ways on how to go about this.  

Touching his possessions is a big no....

Anyway check the legalities first because he last thing you want is for him to have the upper hand or for you to cop a fine.

Perhaps the real estate can guide you as to where to get advice?"
bddq41,"NTA!

Your in-laws are fucking grade A assholes as they seem to be super controlling over your sister. Your sister is only a grade C- only as it seems she got roped in on the whole thing and had no option but to say yes.

Go talk to your sister privately and state your fears and anger. I think she'll understand why you are starting to have some resentment against her."
bddsr9,"NTA, if they wanted your help and expertise they either should let you help them by listening and following your advice or find someone else."
bddvp0,"NTA. Not only is mumps contagious, it can cause sterility in young men who get it. 

But if she's vaccinated and still got mumps, what to say you wouldn't be in the same position? You might want to go to your own doctor and get a vaccine booster, as well, assuming the doctor thinks that's medically appropriate."
bddvxs,"NTA.

> My parents are disappointed in my reaction. They explain my GM's attitude with ""old age"" and ""she's always been difficult"".

lmao perhaps you should explain your reaction with your ""young age"" and ""you always not putting up with childish tantrums"". 

The only big AH here is your grandmother and her children are arguably smaller AHs for justifying and enabling her narcissism and entitlement.


Like you said, he entire fiasco seems like a misunderstanding that could have been cleared up amicably until your grandmother stuck her batty old nose in and if they're blaming you for instigating it and excusing your grandmother's behavior as ""natural"", then by that logic your reaction to what she said is ""natural"" as well."
bddxcr,"NTA

Instead of trying to learn and asking for help during her training stage, she just made wrong statements and provided terrible service. It's better for the customers and the company if she doesn't work there any more.

Plus if there were multiple other complaints it really isn't your fault because others felt the same way and reported it. It's her fault for providing terrible service."
bde13w,"Just out of curiosity, how much is 3$?
How much beers can you buy at a normal bar or student bar (say Which kind of bar), or how many hamburgers can you buy at the MacDonalds, of breads can you buy?

What is the difference between those events?

But from what I already know I would say NTA
Why do they have to ask for donations that many?
And why would you donate to an event that already passed?"
bde4kq,"YTA sadly.  Your sibling was trying to have a private conversation.  For whatever reason, they weren't ready to tell you yet.  People have boundaries and you should respect them, and wait for people to tell you things when they are comfortable to do so.

I would apologise, express that you are just worried and care, but in the future you'll let them come to you in their own time."
bde5hp,"YTA. What if the person in the front of the line brought in 14 of their friends just as the event started? 

It matters in this case because people got in line and waited there for a substantial amount of time to secure their spot in line. Someone probably got in line and counted themselves as the 15th person, and was suddenly booted out of getting the award because you and your friends jumped in. Asshole move and really immature"
bde5s9,"NTA

She damaged your item so you are no longer obligated to buy it. (In fact you aren't obligated to ever buy anything)"
bde65i,"NTA 

I actually thought I'd say YTA but you are trying your best to make her life easier. 

Why wouldn't she want to get checked for it? At least then the doctor could try to help with the symptoms. 

May I ask what she would do if she lived alone? Would she not eat or clean on those days? 

I think it's pretty crappy that she's on at you about the cleaning not being right when at least you are doing it."
bdeak4,"NTA, you don’t want the drama and I think you’re being pretty respectful about it."
bdeazo,"NTA, you need to prioritise you and yours before anyone else. It was amazing of you guys to give it a go."
bded2i,"NTA, they where locking his door for a reason. Nice guy or not it won’t be long until you’re tired of this guy living on your couch. Talk to management about it."
bdeias,"Try going to the doctors about his snoring, there is help out there to help him get better"
bdejbi,[deleted]
bdeke7,NTA. Your brother sounds like a choosing beggar and he is lucky you even watch his kids after the shit he pulls
bdekzr,"NTA - Sounds to me like he could actually need something to occupy him. 

He should also fully support you while you're working this hard to have a good life. That also includes being quiet when you have work in an hour - he can rock in his chair after you're gone for the entirety of your shift."
bdenr2,"NTA - you were just trying to keep yourself and others safe, I don’t see anything wrong with that. I think yelling was justified as well"
bdep6s,NTA - If it was that important they shouldn't have been so tardy.

You should also be thanking them not just for the recommendation, but for the time they invested in you.  The time you took to post this would've been like the time it took to thank one of them. Grow up and get over yourself.

Edit: OP. I'm glad you're writing the thank yous, but even in you edit you come off as a selfish little prick.  Thank yous aren't about helping YOURSELF, they are about thanking the people who have done something nice for you."

However, you do describe yourself as being depressed and stressed. If you start putting up walls between yourself and social events due to depression it tends to turn into a downward spiral. Your mind needs normalcy or depression, sticking to oneself and stress becomes your new normal.

Make sure to maintain a healthy work-life balance and a healthy mind or you can find yourself where I was 6-7 years ago. Alone, paranoid, never meeting friends or family, overworked and hating myself and life in general."

You are under no obligation to write a character letter and, regardless, you should only write one that reflects what your experience with the person.

However, your issue with writing a character letter doesn’t seem to be the guy personally, but your own philosophical objection to character references being considered with regards to legal proceedings in unrelated matters (after all, why would someone’s behaviour at work be considered relevant to what they may or may not have done outside of it?)

So, if asked, you could simply point to your philosophical objection to character references in the justice system and that you therefore will not be giving one.

(Also, I find it *very* strange that a workplace would be actively trying to aid someone with legal proceedings against them. That is beyond merely not assuming they are guilty.)"

By “full rent“, I assume you mean “her share” and am proceeding under that assumption.

Yes, she has an obligation to pay her share. She signed the lease and had an agreement with you to pay half of it until this June.

If she doesn’t want to pay, it should be up to her to find you a roommate that *you* considered to be suitable."

I think you can also frame it as changes that you are making and you want her as an accountability buddy.

Take up a fun active activity together like tennis or yoga or whatever would catch her interest. You said she said she’s into sports, so tell her you should condition together so she “stays” in shape over the summer."

You're not objectively doing anything wrong, although it's usually frowned upon, and she's entitled to be upset although she shouldn't really be guilt tripping you.

bdgu6p,"Yes. You would. Please read this comment, I'm not going to lecture you but I need you to know the severity of this situation. 

You are not the asshole for thinking it might be a poor idea for her to adopt Tumblr genders. However, sending her to mental health camp is NOT the way to respond. Not at all. I'm a professor/counselor at a liberal college, and therefore I encounter many young adults with gender dysphoria. Your daughter is likely experiencing this. She knows she doesn't identify as cis, but she's confused about what she *does* identify as and as a result she's attaching herself to something arbitrary and momentarily appealing. What you need to understand is that gender dysphoria is absolutely terrifying, and sending her to CAMP for treatment will only exacerbate these issues. 

You need to respond with kindness and get her in therapy if she isn't already. Preferably an open-minded, generous therapist who specializes in LGBT youth. This is a crisis moment for your daughter, and she will likely come to her own rational conclusions about her gender if you let her evolve on her own. Adopting confusing genders like this is often a step on the road to self-actualization and sending her to camp with people who suffer from severe mental illness could be disastrous to her health. 

Consider this: If you react with kindness and a year down the line she's still suffering, you still have the ability to choose different ways to react. If you react by sending her to camp, you will never be able to take that back. No LGBT kid responds positively by being sent to mental health camp. Not one."
bdgvkt,"NAH, holding on to the case would be nice, but you don't have to."
bdgvyu,"NTA. And to the people saying INFO, why is it his responsibility to ask her why she didn’t get him anything? She should’ve communicated why if there is a legitimate reason rather than leaving him hanging. Because she didn’t she is an asshole. 

She also got his hopes up by asking multiple times what he wanted, which made it seem like she would get him a present. That makes it even worse in my opinion. 

I do agree that he should ask her about it to communicate properly, but that doesn’t mean she isn’t in the wrong."
bdgwrb,"NTA- they're rude wow. I'd say focus on your other friends that have shown they're true. The ones who didn't even bother canceling showed their true colors. You did a very kind, generous gesture and they were unable or unwilling to show you it was appreciated. 

FYI, as an adult when I make plans or confirm my presence I show up, it's what you should do."

bdinfo,"honestly. Its a pretty understandable rule for that age. she's 14 years old. that's really young. and her boyfriend is 15. still really young but easily old enough to pursue sex. 

every girl i dated up through highschool's parents had similar rules about not closing doors. my own parents even had that rule until my sister was 16 and her boyfriend was allowed to stay over. 

it would be overbearing if she was 17 going on 18. but she's 14...

bdjdm4,"YTA in so many ways, OP

Pay day lenders are a disgusting, predatory industry that is designed to capitalize on people who literally have no other choice. I've never heard of someone taking out a pay day loan and agreeing to the monumental interest rates they provide unless they absolutely needed money right away to keep a roof over their head or feed their children, and *even then* it's a terrible decision that will ultimately blow up in their face. It's such an incredibly horrible deal that you'd have to be really backed into a corner to actually take a pay day loan...or so I thought.

The thought of taking out a pay day loan because you wanted to blow thousands of dollars on a fancy hotel you can't afford for some imaginary anime party you're hoping to have just may be the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. There's nothing ""normal"" about a mistake like that. 

You're not self reliant. I'm assuming your parents are funding your education so that you **dont have to go into debt**, and how are you repaying that generosity? By going into massive debt anyway so you can party instead of focusing on school.

I don't blame them one bit. I would cut you off too. You've shown that you have no appreciation for their money or their sacrifice and that you fully intend for them to bail you out of these problems over and over again because you ""should be allowed to make mistakes"". That kind of reckless, entitled attitude is not going to make anyone inclined to help you out."

> he never made reservations for dinner, so we end up having to try 3 different places and finally get seated around 8:30pm. 

If he really wanted to make the day about you, he would have made reservations. Good reason to be upset.

> He said because it wasn’t technically my birthday until the next day, it wasn’t a big deal we didn’t end up doing anything fun. 

It was a big deal because the fun things were promised then not delivered upon.

> he and his mom had promised for months that my birthday would be special, that they would make up for the lifetime of neglect I’d had with my family, and then when the day actually came, it was the usual letdown. 

If you can't follow through with a promise, don't promise something.

> Late that night, BF gifted me an expensive watch. His POV was – “See? I got you something nice, don’t you feel silly for being upset?” 

It's not about how much is being spent, the price of a gift is far less important than the way the birthday is to be celebrated and he should have known that it sounds like."

The problem isnt the masturbation, its just being a nuisance in bed when people are trying to sleep. It would be no different if she was typing away on a laptop in bed or crocheting. If she wants to do anything like that the decent thing is to go do it somewhere else."
bdlr4d,ESH you for overreacting or cussing at her and she for being all up in your business. Both of you should have gone to a superior. I totally get it. I also have a severe case of astma and it can be annoying to have people doubting you but you have to realize how it looks like to other people. Next time instead of saying trouble breathing actually say astma. Most people I know kinda know what it is so

bdm92q,"YTA, at least invite her and explain to her that you don’t have enough money to pay for her trip but if she has the means she’s able to come along.

bdmcxq,"YTA. Somewhat reading between the lines, but - you've discussed this, seemingly a lot, and she has decided what she wants to do for work this summer. You don't appear to have new points to make, you just want your way because you ""know better."" And want more of her time. 

She can work two jobs if that's how she wants to deal with her expenses. I have friends who did the summer counselor thing despite the crap pay and absolutely loved it. To your GF, it's clearly worth it. To you, not so much. That's your opinion, you've expressed it, accept it and move on. Until you do, you're the asshole here."

Only a little bit on your end though.

She definitely shouldn’t be demanding gifts, or saying that gifts aren’t “significant enough”, regardless of your financial situation.

But you probably should’ve given her some sort of gift at/near the time if you were going to her birthday celebration. Gifts don’t have to be costly, just thoughtful."

bdmmzq,"NTA, but with the caveat that she’s right about you not understanding what it’s like for her. She (and every other young woman in the corporate world) deals with stuff like this quite a lot, and there have been many many times where women have gotten fired/shunned for standing up to their male peers. It’s not right, but it’s reality. You don’t have to like the guy, I wouldn’t either, but as long as you trust her not to act on his advances, I’d leave the rest to her judgement."

She should try being more understanding of other people's schedules and lives. They do not revolve around her."
bdmu05,"YTA, but only barely, because it clearly means a lot to them to send you this stuff even if you're not close with them. I would try to find ways to make it up to them without outright rejecting the gifts."
bdmxae,YTA. The car: It's not your car and it's not your son. The pets: Did he decide to have pets or did you guys? You can't just shove these costs onto someone just like that. It's different if this came out of an agreement between you and your gf but this seems to be coming just from you.
bdmz9s,"NAH, but I'm legit worried about your dad. 

"" I'm really not doing very well, and wasn't sure if it made any difference"" when he's talking about a huge family event that is far in the future is a huge red flag to me.

bdnhhk,"YTA:

>that would be like saying the word moron is offensive to morons

You completely missed your coworkers' point. The word you used is a slur that pretty much only exists to be used against a certain group of people (LGBT). Calling someone a moron is like calling them stupid or dumb, which is very different from calling them a slur.

My problem is that you knew the joke could be offensive, but then you told it anyway and acted surprised when people actually got offended. I see this a lot with """"""dark humor"""""" on the Internet and it's really annoying. In my opinion, the joke itself wasn't even that horrible; the way you reacted to your coworkers is what's making me say YTA."
bdnhyt,"NTA your girlfriend is being a very irresponsible dog owner. Owning a dog is a privilege and requires a lot of time, patience, and effort.

bdnly9,"NAH. You did what you thought was best, although your wife didn’t see it that way. You tried to do what was in her best interest but she valued the truth over low stress. You’re not an asshole for trying to help her out and she’s not an asshole for wishing that you had told her."

bdo2kz,NTA at all. Trust your instincts and decline. Not worth the risk.
bdo4jl,"YTA. What if you were friends with someone and all of the sudden they just stopped talking to you and left you on read? You’d be confused as fuck. You should be straight with him and tell him that you enjoyed being friends with him but got the feeling that he wanted more than a friendship and that wasn’t what you wanted. Crush or not you just don’t drop people with no warning. The only “creepy” thing he seemed to do was walk you to class, and that could have easily been avoided by saying “hey you don’t have to walk me to class, I’m fine/like walking alone”. He probably keeps messaging you because he’s wondering where the heck he went wrong and if you’d actually be honest with him.

Edit: Typo :P"
bdo5qw,"NTA if the kids are going to be spoiled brats and try to get him in trouble they can stand outside the car for five minutes.

bdognj,"NTA, not your choice to have this baby."
bdoipx,"NTA

A relationship shouldn't have to be this minutely planned. James doesn't seem to grasp the concept that you are your own person as well as being in a relationship. In case you are not aware of this fact, in a relationship you don't cease being yourself, and your partner should be happy for you maintaining your own happiness and outside friendships.

I think the truth is lying in your second sentence. When I have heard similar sentiments from friends in the past, the thing that has helped the most is to hear from a loved family member (grandmother, parent, cousin) ""you don't have to keep seeing him, you know?"" You already know you're tired and stressed out from being with him. It's not going to get better."
bdojzr,"ESH.  You can't be serious.  Your choice of words and tone were terrible, and she is terrible for continuing to press the dog agenda after you've told her repeatedly that you don't want one.  Speak to each other like adults."
bdomhv,"NAH but you're treading a fine line.  You've got a good reason for not paying extra dues in there (your money is tight) and a bad reason (I didn't drink the beer).  The tact you're taking risks ostracizing your team and sounding very judgy.  

Talk to your captain about the money situation and also talk to him about maybe doing more team events that don't revolve around booze, but don't cut yourself off from the team by ditching the parties."
bdoo9k,NTA - you’re not required to remain friends with anyone.
bdoscm,"YTA. Your friend is a piece of shit and you’re desire for comfort outweighs what all your other friends are saying. No one else agrees with your decision because, as I said, he’s a piece of selfish shit."

bdoysf,"NTA, he has the option to clean or not take them. You’re being perfectly reasonable."
bdozoo,"NAH, but you should tell your friend if you want to pursue her and be prepared for the fact that he might not be interested in being friends anymore. He doesn’t get to call dibs on women though, so if you’re both interested you don’t need his permission."
bdp1s4,"**NAH, only fools.**This is a hot damn mess.  You broke up but still are basically in a relationship. She started off with another guy and was bouncing back and forth between the two without really disclosing it.  

You have a right to not be okay with that and to state as much (and choose what you will and won't do) but you do not have a right to start giving ultimatums. She has a right to see who she wants but the weird sneaky nature of it all was a bit dishonest. 

All of you need to grow up and start setting boundaries in the beginning of things and not after something kicks off."
bdp2ej,"NTA.

> But then he made comments about his penis that pretty clearly constituted hitting on me, and I told him I had to leave about ten-fifteen minutes after those comments

All of this when you were first meeting up...jesus. I'm not a fan of ghosting people but he kept hitting on you when you clearly weren't comfortable and followed you, you were ok to do so in this case."

Oh wait. You can't.

bdp2uw,"NTA.
It’s your trip, and a fairly expensive one at that. You should’ve considered it instead of flat out saying no, but it’s completely understandable to want to ensure that you’ll enjoy your time and not leave with any feelings of being excluded.

bdp5vf,"NTA 

You can end a friendship for any reason. Your reason sounds a lot more legit than most."
bdp7vv,"YTA you don't really have any strong reasons to cut your sister out except for the fact that you think she's ""self-absorbed"". It's a really big moment for her. You even admit that you don't want to go and are using the possible promotion as an excuse. It seems like there might be some sibling rivalry going on."
bdp96d,NTA. I hate those games. Don't call me then get mad when they don't call.
bdpady,"YTA. Small growths should be at least treatable, and refusing to let a vet see your dog in this situation, is like refusing a doctor to a sick child, **they can't make the choice for themselves**.

Take the dog to the vet, they will tell you what's wrong, and help him/her feel better. Do not be afraid of judgement, decent vets will understand that you were educated one way about how to take care of your dog, and give advice on how to IMPROVE the care.

Lastly, if you love the dog, then putting it to sleep is the humanitarian way to end the suffering **after a long treatment**, it is not the first course of action."
bdpc7n,"NAH, but if I were you, I'd just go to the wedding. If your kid was old enough to care about the birthday it would be one thing, but birthdays for 1 year olds are just adult socializing anyway."
bdpcne,NTA the original deal was a trade the moment she said “don’t worry about it” you were absolved on the debt. And you even tried to           re-offer the trade item. She needs to remove the stick from her butt.

bdpmms,NTA for leaving. WBTA for telling. You can leave it at a vague “disagreement over terms.”
bdpnmj,The fuck kinda therapy is that?
bdptn9,NTA - sounds like your friend is unstable and demanding. I am not sure what your living arrangement is but he sounds like an ass to me.
bdpv4a,"NTA, you did the right thing. There’s an immediate conflict of interest there, you took the proper steps towards HR then to the boss, and you left it in the hands of the boss. Nothing there is overreaching. Your boss is an asshole though that should be kept confidential"
bdpywd,"NTA 

That is gross and can help spread diseases."
bdpz6g,"NAH. Your concerns are valid. So is his feeling hurt by the reversal and feeling as if he's been cut from the decision making.

To be honest, it sounds like you weren't that convinced this is what you want in the first place. If his salary is as described, I wonder if you're using this as an excuse to get some breathing room on reconsidering what is a big and life changing decision."

bdq139,"NTA. 

Those people know how their company works. They know what the lead-in is. They're choosing to participate anyway."
bdq2io,"NAH. I get what you are saying and you are right. Look some RAs are very cool, very lease and some are very stricter. She’s an R.A. that seems very strict. Even though she has no right to speak to you like that, but if you was doing “wrong” or in a situation to do “wrong”, you’re fighting a up hill battle (wrong being break a simple rule like no sleeping in the public couch if you have it or not). First I would go to the hall coordinator (head RA) and/or collegium and tell they about the interaction and what you don’t like about it and go from there. Since you are the older one here, act like the older one. Turn every interaction into a work business interaction with her. If she says points out something you are doing wrong, stop doing it immediately, don’t argue, and leave. Then write an email about that situation and send it to the powers that be. Explain the situation clearly and without getting emotional and show the fault in her ways and arguments. If she wants to make your life difficult, make hers difficult as well. And do it with a smile too."

bdq4fb,"NTA 

You don’t have to deal with anyone who doesn’t make time for you that’s your right as a person but it would be shitty of you to be like him and cancel last minute as his ride, if you’re gonna cancel at least give him like 4 or 5 days in advance to manage a new ride, and maybe mention you want a genuine apology and to be treated better"
bdqfse,"Honestly? NAH. Your boyfriend seems awkward and doesn't know when to join into a conversation is what it seems like to me. However maybe tell him how it's rude to cut into one at certain points, and maybe give him tips on how to join a conversation naturally and not rudely."

bdqn4d,"YTA

Like I get it, but she’s about to go under the knife for you, which has risks for her health, and you’ve convinced her it’s because you love each other when all you’re seeing her as is an organ farm. You’re getting the kidney under false pretences and that’s completely and utterly morally wrong."
bdqpr8,"NTA - not only do you have the right to not want to send the money, instead of flat out saying no you offered legitimate alternative solutions to this problem, it seems clearly like if MIL has a place to live rent free theres no reason to be sending $400 a month.

You could have respectfully texted him asking him to take out the trash without calling him out for something petty in front of someone else.

bdqr90,"NAH

It is your knife.  You can tell people who uses it.

If the other knives suck that badly, they probably just need sharpened."
bdquqt,"NAH - some people just don't communicate as well over text, and I think you gotta understand that. Talking to her about it, and explaining the way you feel, would be the best way to approach it. If you feel as though you don't feel as close to her over text, she'll probably care about that and make an effort if you explain it."
bdqurp,"No judgement.

Ultimately, it is your money and your children.  Buy them whatever you want in accordance with your custody agreement.

Realize that you're raising their expectations for what they should be receiving evidenced by the wish list, and that will come to a sudden end if your prognosis is terminal.  You buying them more material goods isn't going to make them love you more or create any long-lasting memories.

Consider instead taking them on a trip or doing something with them they'll enjoy.  Taking 10 year olds on a vacation to Disney or something sounds like a much longer-lasting experience than getting them toys they will grow out of."

bds1zi,"NTA, but your brother may be though.

You and your boss are assholes. 

That was an opportunity ripped away from someone who actually deserved it.

I had actually planned on writing ESH because you took the stuff down without his consent but it isn't like you threw it out and to be honest, I have very loud alarm bells going off inside my head about this guy's behaviour.

bdslxn,"NTA.  Dogs sleep on the floor especially huge ones.

However, it looks like the dog means a lot to him.  So now you are on a rocky road.  You either can compromise or he has to compromise.  But since you do not like cuddles at all, you put yourself in a sticky situation

Ask him if no cuddling bothers him and let the honesty out.  Sometimes finding another bf to put up with your sleep maybe better.

He's putting on a tantrum and not looking to compromise either.   The dog clearly has his own bed."
bdsmls,"I have siblings, so I can relate.  Honestly, it sounds like he’s just getting under your skin because he can- even if that means he has to do more chores.  So, honestly, I’d just stop letting it get to you.  Either he will stop or you will get him to wait in you hand and foot- lol!  

I’d just say something like “if you can’t wait an hour, then have at it, bro” and then refuse to engage if he tries to rub it in later.  Just ignore those comments.  You do have choices here and you don’t have to play the game if you don’t want to."
bdspio,"NTA since that's how you and your girlfriend joke with each other. Though if I were you, I'd avoid making those jokes in front of people you don't know well and who don't know how you interact with each other.

Your girlfriend's new co-workers sound pretty sanctimonious though. Especially since she's already explained that you two were joking."

Why would you be the asshole because you find certain groups of people annoying? I would phrase it differently though, just say it's not really your type.  You don't need to go into details.   

Behavior is not a race.  Personality is not a race.  You dont' have to date people you find obnoxious to be seen as open-minded."

bdt2kz,NTA I do the same shit and unless it's something important that has a time based concern then fuck it You reply whenever you want
bdt2uf,"NTA - though the asshole here is your brother, not your parents.

From your parents POV, they've done what they need to with you - you're succeeding. You've achieved enough to no longer need their help.

Your ""Bad"" brother still needs their help - in their eyes he's less independent, and they probably blame themselves. He's their kid, what else can they do but prop him up?

It's his problem, taking advantage of their good will.

If I were you, I would have a chat with them about whether he might, just a bit, be taking advantage of them."
bdt6s8,"NTA

But tell her why you are ending the friendship. Don't let her argue with you or try to tell you you're wrong because she is legit being an uncaring and terrible friend. I think its fair to let someone know why the friendship is over though."

Intro level courses are for people with no experience. If you want more of a challenge, take a higher level course."
bdtfok,"YTA, but not for the reasons you think. I understand your love and passion for your career and it sounds like you have been doing this for awhile. You’re already missing so much, and your wife has already made years worth of compromises for you and for your passion, but you work in maritime logistics. There are other ways of doing this while still coming home every night.

Why I voted YTA is because your wife is lonely, and she has very valid concerns, and you suggested for her to get a nanny. I was gonna say NAH, but that was kind of a naive suggestion and showed that you don’t really understand her concerns. She wants you. She wants her husband. She wants her children to have their father. Yes, money is great in this world, but there’s family. 

I would suggest based off of a couple paragraphs I’ve read (so like take this with a huge ass grain of salt), but possibly discuss relocating the family to work at a marine port where you do shift work. It’ll pay well, maybe not as well as your current position, but the kids will have their dad back, and a wife will have her husband. 

Lastly, it sounds like she’s already made huge compromises. It’s time you made some for her"
bdtifv,"NTA: She is literally abusing you and your family. You have every reason to not give a damn about her, and the fact that you specifically say you don't hate her speaks volumes to your character. I applaud you for being able to put up with A+ tier bullshit."
bdtll7,"NTA to me. You were worried about the wellbeing of an infant. Your husband was trying to dismiss it ""because culture"" which is a shitty excuse. Tradition does not make it right or moral. Maybe the cops did something, maybe they didn't, but you did all you could. You didn't go further that you should have. If you had tried to personally intervene, I would understand the hostility, but all you did was inform the police. Public safety is their job. You aren't in the wrong."
bdtmv6,"NTA, he's not taking no for an answer. Honestly do not respond anymore. He took you agreeing to meet him as him having a chance."
bdtrhx,"NTA: She is much more advanced than the rest of the group, and although she may be getting a confidence boost, it's certainly demoralizing for the other girls. Especially if they realize that she's not working as hard as them. You gave it a shot last year to see if she would move up, she did not. At this point, the only way for her to move was to force her too. Also, the mom is seriously mad because her daughter is BETTER and has to be put in a more advanced level? That's insane."
bdtsxk,"NTA. She is the one who's being rude and a dick to you. You're definitely NTA here. As for giving her a second chance, I'd be very wary. Test the waters, don't dive straight in though. You can usually judge a person better this way, rather than just forgiving straight away. And if you do forgive her? Don't forget what she did."
bdttnu,"I don't think you're an asshole for pointing out the differences. This is pretty common though. The first kid usually has more restrictions. Your parents were new to parenting. When your sister came along, they loosened up more. I have the same age difference with my little sister and she definitely got to do things that I didn't get to do. I remember having to wait until a certain age to get my ears pierced but my sister was able to get hers done as soon as she asked at a younger age."

bdudyg,"First let me say you are a stand up guy for not allowing your sister to cut the ex out of his children's life. Fathers are important. 

With that said: 
ESH, 

The ex sucks for cheating and I'm guessing he's doing some other things that you don't know about.  
Your sister sucks for keeping the kids away from the ex. 
And you suck for bad mouthing your sister to the ex and casting suspicion on her current bf despite no evidence to the contrary. In the best case your, bad-mouthing just destroys your ability to act as an honest broker between your sister and ex, in the worst he'll lawyer up and use your words for to sue for custody of the kids. 

Apologize to your sister, but let her know in no uncertain terms that keeping her kids away from their father is evil and you will not help her in that."
bdues1,"NTA. Ok, your gf and bff were dumb to play this joke BUT your bff took it on snapchat AND saw no problem to tell you it was your gf. For me it sounds like something just funny to them. If it was a real flirty thing, your bff wont snapchat the thing and tell you. Once again, you right to be hurt and giving the cold shoulder but I dont thing it was cheating.

bdvycf,"ESH. Its really hard for me. First off, I'm black so fuck her and her racist attitudes.  That said, I don't know that using a private conversation to go to the dean is really a good move for you either.  If she was publicly shouting this at someone, posting it on social media, or something else, then I'd be a bit more on your side.  Saying things like this in your home, to me, is a bit different.  Hell, even if she yelled this at your boyfriend in her home, I'd say it was different.  But this is too slippery of a slope for me to really be ok with it.  A lot of things have become ""hate speech"" these days.  Even if you don't like it, I think that people can say certain things in their home and shouldn't suffer professionally for it.  I have used the C-word to describe women in my home (I don't use it often, but I'd be lying if I said I've never used it) and I'd hate for someone to go to my job claiming I'm a misogynist.  I've used the r-word when saying something is dumb.  I wouldn't want someone to report me for being ableist.  My point is, people say things in private that they wouldn't necessarily feel great about being made public.   This clearly crossed your line . But when if your boyfriend or someone else used terms you didn't like to describe a person who pissed them off?  Do you report them too even if it was just said at home?

Also, do you have an RA (I assume its a dorm, but can't tell).  If so, maybe go to them and tell them the story and see if you'd be able to leave your room and move someplace else to get away from her."

bdw5y2,"NTA

This is a common pattern by parents who are abusive to sabotage independence for their kids and create a dependency and is more about control than anything else. Even if you come from some privilege, it does not make it okay for them to completely eradicate autonomy and reasonable amount of free will.

It is not okay for them to prevent you from getting a job or prevent you from getting a license and prevent you from doing things on your own and threatening you it’s either or. A reasonable parent will try to have balance between both their support and your autonomy."

Could we limit the overnight sessions to X times per week for a while?""

Your brother doesn't suck for expecting his family to accept the person he loves, and you don't suck for not wanting to hear your brother having sex all night long. What makes you all suck is your inability to sit down and talk with each other like grownups- you can't speak up, and he can't react rationally."

bdyd35,NTA . family's are tricky. Your mom sounds like my mom.  I just put distance between us then I filter all information I give her so she only hears the good. I never show weakness and when asked I always jokingly say I am the greatest and try to exhibit as much confidence as possible. This makes it really hard to compare me to others as all she knows are my successes. This while sounding bad has successfully turned an emotionally abusive relationship into a good one as I've successfully made her respect me even if it is through censorship.  That being said she will still try to tear down this barricade of success.  Like I told her I have only 100s in my major classes.  Her what does that say about your School?

You will be dead, so you won’t be affected, but you will destroy the relationship between your three children.

be3mcn,"NAH.

You are more than welcome to be upset about an independent agency reducing the funds they had told you that you would be receiving, but at the same time, those funds are provided to people for the costs of tuition.  You won't have costs of tuition and if you do it right, the government is going to take care of everything.  Yes, you have a serious commitment ahead of you with military service, but scholarships are limited to the most deserving.  Clearly you are deserving in the academic and moral sense if you have been recruited to an academy, but financially, you just aren't as in need of other applicants.  If you have been accepted to an academy, you are going to school and getting an education.  Someone in a similar situation as you that won't be going to an academy may not be able to afford their own tuition, and that is why scholarships exist.  Scholarships aren't designed to be awards for being a kickass high school student, they are designed to help people pay for an education...and the federal government has picked up your tab."
be3wuf,"WNBTA for sharing your perspective, but in your post you say “maybe there are people poorer than me for whom $300 is a massive burden.” I’m going to tell you right now, that isn’t a “maybe”—there absolutely are people, many people, for whom $300 is the difference between eating or starving.

You have clearly been willing to compromise with the arrangement, as someone who woke up for school at 6:30am and now for work at 5:50am I can completely understand waking up before the impending alarm (it happens to me at weekends too).

There is the really obvious point of doing it after work (like I go to the gym after work twice a week), I suspect you may have already covered this previously. But surely she's losing sleep too by setting the alarm earlier than she needs, in order to simply wake-up (without Yoga)!"

It was really awful. We always insisted on taking her out somewhere for dinner but she refused. I'd usually either ""feel sick"" or ""I'd had a big lunch"" or declare that I was stuffed after eating as much as I could stomach. We always stopped at McDonalds on the way home.

I feel like you just said that it was their last day and that you were going to spend it with them. That's why he feel's scorned because you most likely just made him feel guilty that you never get to see them.

After a whole week of entertaining a family while being super depressed about work, I would be a bit sad too. He probably was so happy thinking about the nice relaxing birthday night he was gonna have since he figured that's what the plans were after he was nice to spend that time with your family.

I'm calling bullshit that you asked in a compromising way is the main point.

Edit: For everyone thinking I'm bashing, I'm not. I've just been in a similar situation and feels like quite a bit is missing out of the story. How long was the BF with the family? I mean like if he was hanging with them a majority of the time vs only seeing them once then yeah wtf was he thinking.

Edit2: Switched to ESH because this relationship has awful communication and could have all been avoided with a simple conversation from both sides.

Edit3: Thankfully u/rabbitgods didn't take offense to my questions like some of the other people. Hearing more from that side of the story, he acted way out of line and she was nice of enough to let him know with plenty of time beforehand.

Your friend is in a denial stage, and honestly, I'd get a school counselor or someone else to deal with her depression and other mental issues. There's not much else you can do, and it would be hard to always have that cloud over your head when you've been able to weather the storm."

be9jbq,"NTA.

On the one side, I understand your friends.  It's legal.  It's medicine.  It's whatever to them.  If you are at their place, they dictate what is and isn't allowed.  You can request, but they are under no obligation to conform to your wishes.

On the other side, I get that you have a profession to maintain and advance.  You have to look out for your own interests and well-being.  I have known far too many people willing to pass on good paying jobs because weed.

Just be brutally honest and put it on you.  You can't have any negative drug tests because of what you may put yourself around.  Because really, your piss test is on you, no one else."
be9v55,ESH - she should not have snooped through your phone while you were sleeping. But you did a very difficult thing to get over and she’s probably still insecure about your commitment to her and affected by it. She needs to learn to trust you but it takes time and you should be also be willing to be transparent and give her opportunity to trust you again. Maybe negotiate with her that she can ask you at any moment for you two to go through your phone together until she feels more comfortable again? But don’t stand for clear violations of your privacy. Discuss it with her and see how you can both feel comfortable going forward.
be9x0g,"YTA. Or would be. 

Racially diverse casting is a good thing. I get that you’re concerned about the implication, but the actors that best suit each role should be cast. 

Also with it only being two weeks out, it’s a bit late."
be9xtf,"NTA, this was a zero-sum situation and she made the event unfun for literally everyone else by cheating."
be9zgo,"NTA at all.  You vouching for someone is also a reflection of yourself, which looks bad if/when they flake out.  Protect numero uno"
bea05h,"Yeah YTA. Sorry. Not a huge asshole, but still an asshole. 

It doesn’t matter how friendly everyone is with each other, nobody wants to hear someone else have sex (unless that is their fetish, I guess). 

If the other girls are being loud, you are more than welcome to call them out on it. If the other girls are being loud and nobody else is calling them out, then they are assholes for singling you out."
bea1b2,NAH. But I would advise you to use this as time to try out methods that would help cope  best you can. There are times in life where you will be forced to break away for your comforts and having a tested protocol for dealing with it can be helpful.
bea87c,"NAH. While I understand and appreciate her hurt feelings she needs to suck this one up. Shes asking to live in with your family, I'm assuming rent free, so its natural they want to know why you are bringing a freeloader into their home. You aren't an asshole for being honest given you aren't doing it maliciously. 

She feels shame which is understandable but if she wants the benefits of you/your families wealth, she has to understand the cost may come to her privacy. If this is a step too far for her, thats on her (even if I think thats insanely dumb)."
beaaz7,NTA. She sounds like a spoiled woman-child. Her reasons for imposing restrictions on you and your mom are arbitrary and ridiculous. She sounds pretty crazy and I would stay away from her if I were you. Definitely a wedding that will not be fun to go to anyway.
beab2v,"Eh, ESH. Obviously the two girls were being dicks and I can understand the difficulty for you to concentrate on driving, but on the other hand the idea of leaving two 15 year old girls alone on a country road in the middle of nowhere makes me really uncomfortable. I would have maybe stopped and told them what shits they were being and explained why it was dangerous and given them a chance to sort themselves out before kicking them out."
beabo6,"NAH. Just remember you're a product of your environment and unfortunately a lot of environments perpetuate the idea that whiter is better/more beautiful. Dark skinned girls get treated poorly all around, more so than guys since girls get judged more on looks.

Also fwiw as a mixed girl I get really suspicious when a guy only dates one ""type"" of woman especially when that type doesn't look like him. It's some kind of self hatred going on that I'm not willing to be around."
beaeal,"NTA, that's pretty hurtful."
beaeeo,"NTA.

You can't seriously think you're an asshole for not wanting to live with your ex? Lol. 

Get your own place."
beafz5,"NTA but unless you really need of the money I'd let it go and just not lend him your car again. He absolutely should have stuck to his end of the bargain and refilled your car, or at the very least filled what he used. But you guys are friends and you know he's having a hard time - he probably wanted to make prom special for his gf and got in over his head and tried to clean the car to makeup for it. If you need the money you aren't the asshole for asking for it, but if it's not going to impact you that much I'd let it go this one time."
beaheq,[deleted]
beak3z,"NTA

Your money, your stuff. If people don't like that, they can buy their own."
beakbq,NAH. It makes sense why she wouldn’t want him over. I doubt it’s with ill intentions but unvaccinated kids CAN spread diseases and illnesses around and I think she’s just being cautious.
bealvn,"It's an unfortunate situation, but you let them know as soon as possible and it's not like they can expect you to give up your job to watch their kid. They're just in a tight spot, is all. NAH."
beanqq,"NAH: I don't think you were being rude at all. When my mom takes us out to eat and pays, I'll often front the tip or at least contribute (if she insists we don't pay at all). I always leave something, though."
beapmt,"NTA, but I still think you should call if you can stand it at all. Also check out r/raisedbynarcissists for help dealing with your parents."
beasr8,"YTA - This is a stupid malicious compliance.

Why not just leave all your stuff at home. Show up with no pencil, no paper, no nothing. When your teachers ask just say super loudly IT WAS IN MY BACKPACK THAT IM NOT ALLOWED TO BRING ANYMORE 

When you get sent to the office, repeat. 

When they ask how youre gonna do work with no supplies, flip it on them, and ask ""I Dunno, how AM I gonna do work with no supplies? Did you consider that before banning the thing I carry my supplies in?"" etc. 

It would actually be fun, if you have the right kinda personality."

Absolutely NTA. If she is in medical school then she definitely *should* know that she shouldn’t be doing this. But we all have somewhat skewed visions of ourselves and it sounds like hers are driving her to be unhealthy. Add to that wedding stress and i can understand why she would be upset at you. It’s a tough situation, and I don’t know exactly how I would suggest you handle it, but you are *definitely* not an asshole for caring about your spouse’s well being."
beaz1y,"NAH. You have legitimate reasons for not being able to attend and you still chipped in to keep costs down! And the bride, while expressing that she would miss you, understands.

Stop feeling guilty!"
beazij,"No, I wouldn't say it's you being jealous. There's a level of respect that animals/pets deserve and roommate is essentially keeping *your* pet hostage.

beb26y,"Yes, YTA. If your daughter is vaccinated and not otherwise immuno-compromised (and neither is anyone else in your household) this seems like an over-reaction.

Cheating is never acceptable.  Literally never.  If she wasn't happy in the relationship she could have talked with him about her needs that weren't being filled or left.

bec8rg,"NAH, but you're close.  The thing about funerals is that they're not for the dead.  In this case, it's not for you, either.  It's for your dad.

If you're really that concerned, take it up with a supervisor. As someone who has also worked for a particular non-profit school age program, I ultimately stopped policing language unless it was happening around the younger kids. Sure, it's not great to hear potty mouth teenagers talking about this or that, but in the grand scheme of things, there's a LOT worse they could be doing. This student doesn't seem to be disrespecting anyone and knows his boundaries with other staff. If a particular staff member is okay with this/partaking in it, either leave it alone or complain to someone who can actually do something about it. At the end of the day though, it's not really harming anyone. I'd say to just leave it alone."

bedljy,"NAH

I think the biggest problem is your last comment "" feel like a racist asshole because I don't really think what I did was 'wrong' in the first place. ""

There's a lot to unpack here and it probably can't easily be gotten into in a thread on AITA. But I'll try to be brief:

It's possible to do or say something that isn't ""wrong"" and still have it be something that other people have to deal with so often that it becomes a needle in their side. Historically black women's hair has been mocked, made fun of, judged, reviled, \[add any other derogatory you want to think of here\]. Black women have been told that their natural hair is ""inappropriate"" for business. They have been told that it's not appropriate for them to dye their hair or wear locs or have a 'fro or wear cornrows or braids. If their hair is ""too straight"" or colored the ""wrong color"" - whatever that means - they're accused of trying to ""act white"". If they wear wigs, that's mocked or considered unprofessional (although most white people couldn't tell if a black woman was wearing a wig if they were asked). If a black woman wears a headscarf or tells a white person that she needs a silk or satin pillow cover to sleep on, she's mocked. Little girls are teased for having twists or multiple pony tails. 

And then there's the fascination that many (not all) white people have with black people's hair. Black women are constantly asked ""can I touch it"" or ""is it oily"" and things like that. 

So if you're a white person, think about it in terms of if half or 2/3 of the people you interact with every day commented on your hair. Even strangers. Every day. Or every other day.  Even if what they were saying wasn't rude or overtly racist, after a while wouldn't it make you scream in frustration. ""It's just my goddamn hair just shut up about it already""??

That's what a micro-aggression is. It's not about you intentionally being a jerk or a racist or anything like that.  It's about a society that doesn't allow black women to just have hair without comment. 

So was what you did ""wrong""? That's the key here. It's all in how you define ""wrong"". Were you intentionally perpetrating a white micro-aggression on a black woman? No. Because you didn't know. You meant well. But now you know. Now you know that white people commenting on black women's hair is something that is an issue that you weren't aware of. 

Are you racist because you did something you didn't know was a problem at the time? No.

Would you be racist if you kept doing it and kept insisting that it's not wrong for you to do because you have no way of understanding what black women deal with every single day about their hair and appearance? Yes. 

And maybe this analogy helps: You are joking with a coworker about work and you make a comment about ""this project makes me want to kill myself"". Your coworker laughs but later another coworker tells you ""you know her father committed suicide. you were pretty insensitive there"". Would you consider that you did something ""wrong"" with your original comment? Would you still apologize for being insensitive and then NOT do that thing again, knowing now what you know? It's kind of the same thing."

bedqk1,NTA. She sounds like a treat to be around.
bedtx9,"NAH but you should at least understand your fathers grief by imagining how it would be if one of your own parents or sibling died.  It’s not cool to inject your own lack of empathy into the situation.  Also not cool for your Dad to do, too.  I’m sure he found the contrast kind of distressing."
bedxh3,Not the asshole. It would cost more to take an Uber / etc. 20$ is more than reasonable.
bedxnd,"YTA - having your first kid is a pretty trying time, and no doubt your wife is just as nervous and unsure as you are. I get that you want to retain some semblance of self, but your wife probably isn’t able to see how she’ll manage that too, and you *are* being a bit “me me me” with it all. 

The reality is that you can’t really plan in such detail now for when the baby is here, because you just don’t know how things will be. But if you do want to have these conversations, perhaps you could frame them like this instead: “honey, I was having a think about it and I reckon if I went to work...etc etc then I could go to the gym *AND then I could look after the baby at X time so you can [insert wife’s favourite hobby here]*”"

Im not saying don't show, im saying the opposite.

This is gonna be the best shifts of yourlife. You get to go in and 100% give zero fucks. If anyone so much as looks at you funny, you can walk out. If they ask you to do a task you don't want, you can walk out. 

This is going to be the best shift, or shifts, of your life in that place. Why would you give them up?

beedp3,"NAH

It was an honest mistake, but why didn't you just call him and say he had mail?"
beehb4,"ESH. Yes, you would be the AH for locking her out. The mature thing to do is establish your boundaries and have a conversation with her. Stand up for yourself, not by passive aggressively locking everyone out of the laundry room. But calmly and firmly establish what you will and will not compromise on as someone who has an equal right to be there (since it sounds like you both aren't paying to live there)."
beehp8,"YTA. When your friend asks ""Do you have a specific day in mind?"" you should have replied with when you're available and making it clear that you can cater to his friend's schedule. That 'maybe' definitely sounds like you may or may not show up and his friend will have to wait to see. 


Also, the fast turn around between asking for a favor and the fairly dismissive ""never mind"" is not so cool. If you were going to change your mind so fast and you didn't ""need"" him to be your ""middleman"" or ""set up the meeting,"" why did you bother your friend in the first place?"
beehsa,"NAH- it's a shitty situation, you want to be supportive but literally cannot make the sacrifice because it's such an important meeting.

bef9kx,NTA. Once you said “does it matter” your prof should have stopped. That’s it.
bef9sj,"NTA

Obviously. That sounds like a very good parenting strategy, making her think about what she likes about all the kids and making her think twice before she acts like a bully again. Of course your wife totally undermined it for no reason whatsoever. I guess we know where your daughter learned to be a bully."
befd4o,"I'd say NAH. While ghetto does not literally mean ""black"", I think everyone in North America can agree that contextually, it means lower class black person. You'd most likely call a white person of similar class white trash, not ghetto. So the word ghetto definitely has racial undertones. If all of the people she rejected for being ""ghetto"" are black, it definitely seems like she's at least picking up on those racial undertones. Assuming she's a white woman, married to a mixed race (I'm going to assume 1/2 white and 1/2 black?), she probably definitely considers herself not racist, or able to ""look past"" race, maybe even prides herself on that. So it makes sense that she'd be offended, especially with that accusation coming from you. I'd recommend you try and help her understand the racial context of that word, and how it feels seeing it only attributed to black people. Normally, I'd say you have no responsibility to teach someone to understand things like that, but considering she's your wife, you'll want to help her get it, and how you feel."
befdzd,YTA - why dont you ask your boss his opinion?

befqpr,"NTA, you don’t want them to come on the cruise for the family. That’s ok. You guys are seeing them for a week afterwards. If they want to go on a vacation with you guys, everyone should plan that accordingly. But they shouldn’t just hop on to the family vacation you had planned out"
befsp1,"YTA.  (or would be).  

You can at least invite her, try to keep it civil & on a friends level since you'll still be around each other.  Not inviting her would only add tension to the situation & perpetuate the awkwardness - extend the invitation & leave the decision to her whether or not to attend."
beftwi,"YTA

>I still live at home

She's still supporting you.  Lying to her about this is a shitty move.  If you aren't interested in the party or making a big deal about it then be an adult and have a conversation with her."
befuki,"NTA. I think that it might not be a bad idea to monitor it, like the friend can only come over to your house, only playing in the living room, etc."

beh241,"NTA - having a rabbi come and discuss the holiday is not a problem - children should learn about different religions, especially if they are going to make informed decisions as adults, observing holidays is not a problem as we should observe more than just Christian holidays. I do draw the line at having students wear a yarmulke though, if they were entering a temple this would be fine because they are choosing to be a part of the proceedings of that faith but they are not, that one should be parent/student choice.

You are in your rights to want your relationship to be taken seriously and to sleep next to your partner instead on small beds with children. Talking to her about this is reasonable.

However it *is* your sister's house and you are guest so you gotta abide by her rules whatever she decides (much as you and I and lots of us here disagree with them).

**Could you argue to sis that you have what is equivalent to a common law marriage? I know only a few states accept this and the rules are not so clear but this could be a way to legitimize your wants and express to her how you two view the relationship - long-term partners who haven't said an oath yet even though the sentiment is there and you clearly have shown a big level of commitment.**"

behnmi,"NAH. It sounds like it's not really a scholarship, just money that your family friend already decided to give to you. Things like that are pretty common in Asian cultures at least. It comes with some light strings attached and it's meant to maintain the friendship between your families.

If no one else is writing essays for it, then no one's time is wasted. Just accept the money and do good things with it. If you want to give it to your friend, the future chef, she probably won't accept it directly. Just support her whenever the opportunity presents itself."

behph6,"I'm gonna go with NAH.

Call me old-fashioned, but I'm not a particularly big fan of polyamory myself but I totally understand that other people's love lives are none of my business. However, it's very reasonable to see why your parents may have a problem with the situation, especially if the holiday is a religious one and there will be other family members that they may have to explain the situation to. 

They are completely within their right to ask you to come with just your husband, especially considering legally, he's the only one part of your family. Bringing Z, would put your parents in a difficult situation that they might not be comfortable with and you need to respect that.
However, if you truly do love Z and your husband, and can't bring yourself to go without Z, then it's also reasonable for you to not go. Quite frankly that's probably the most mature decision you could make if you don't want to leave her behind. 

That's why, while I am personally on your parents' side due to my own personal beliefs, without my biases, I would say NAH."

bek19t,"NTA - you get to choose what relationship you have with your parents. Being a parent doesn't mean you can act anyway you want but still own the right to a relationship with your child. Your father has been repeatedly disrespectful to you and whilst you can empathise with why this might be, because he's clearly unwell, it doesn't mean you have to put up with his behaviour. You are entitled to set boundaries in order to protect yourself and IMO, if what you need to do right now is shut him out of your life because he is continually disrespecting you, frightening you and stressing you out, then by all means, shut him out. Sorry to hear you're having to deal with such a horrible situation, it can't be easy."
bek1o6,"NAH....First and foremost, you should be proud that you stood up and helped out your mom like you have.  Most kids would not care.  Major KUDOS to you for doing that.  Secondly, you are young and have a life, that your mom wants you to stay is selfish.  You need to get on with your life and be able to find your love and move up in the world.   Be strong and move out but do not forget to visit, write, email, text or call your mom daily.  She will understand in the end.  That illness for her is called empty nest syndrome.  All parents get it.  I hope you have a great time once you move out and expand your wings.  Just be wise and don't do anything that could jeopardize your future.  Best wishes for the future!"
bek4y5,"NTA - You’ve been helpful and a good friend to them this entire time. Overcrowding your living space would be a big stressor, financially and emotionally.

Besides, it's wonderful to know that you've got this unconditional love. And you will be super accountable to stay sober. 

Btw good on ya OP. You broke addiction many do not and survived some harsh harsh harsh things. 
You're a strong fella and a great example."
bekffx,"NAH

You’re allowed a private life as long as you aren’t doing anything to hurt others. Casual dates don’t need to know everything all at once.

But that’s up to you to decide."
bekgu5,NTA. You can’t keep putting your life on hold while her and her parents drag their feet about her moving in with you. She has no right to be angry at you for wanting to start your career and do well financially. Once burned and all that as well.
bekpp8,"YTA for being unaware of the crowd dynamics, concert layout and GF for being a bit of a drama llama.  If the balcony is sloped gently downward, people standing in the front row of the balcony will block the view of 100% of the rest of the balcony (unlike most floor seating  arrangements where people are looking upward at the stage so standing isn't always blocking everybody.)   So yes, it's an asshole move to stand in front on the balcony.

Instead of crying, maybe GF could be a little more aware of the hundreds of other people around her to avoid stuff like that in the future.

Edited:  realized it was GF who was being a drama llama, not GF's friend, who was just being oblivious"

bel7qz,"NTA

But I would be very wary. This sounds a bit like your mom wants to ""buy"" you back? Like she would expect you to be forever grateful, and will bring it up every time you try to critizise her."
bel86c,"NAH. You deserve to have your voice heard, and hiding any pain won't make it go away. 

Making your mom aware of your situation may make it easier to find coping mechanisms for the time being. Earplugs help me when I get overwhelmed by noise, and a sachet with some essential oils could help you control what you smell.

Edit: Should have been No assholes here, not not the asshole"
belae7,"NTA. 

The problem here isn't you, it's your boyfriend. You describe him as great in every way except for the fact he belittles your financial contributions, which he uses as an excuse to justify spending all his time on work or skimming through his phone. 

If his mind is truly racing and he needs to be learning, he needs to have a consultation with a family doctor because he could have issues like ADHD or anxiety. This is not normal behaviour. Setting guidelines in your relationship where the phone doesn't come out, like at dinner, the hour before bedtime, or on dates, might help you here as well. If he outright refuses to get a checkup or wean himself off his phone -- there are great apps out there to limit use, fyi -- then the problem isn't you, it's him. Use a request to spend more time together as a litmus test. If he spazzes out or refuses, you might want to reconsider this longterm. Business shouldn't trump you. 

No one in a healthy relationship frequently reminds his partner ""I have to work so we have a roof over our head"" in a joking tone. That's being an asshole on his part. Please reassess the boundaries and behaviours of a healthy relationship, because he's not being supportive of you!"
belb94,"NAH - feelings aren't always reciprocated, whether it be friendship or relationship.

If you don't feel comfortable, you don't have to speak to him.

Men ~~NEVER~~ in my experience rarely touch other men on the lower back in the same way. If you wouldn't touch a guy you don't know in that location in that way, then don't touch a woman you don't know there.

I realize that this is one of those changing social norms - it used to be ~~ok~~ socially/culturally acceptable for a man to touch a woman in places that he wouldn't touch another man. But it's no longer ok. So you didn't know that before. Now you know.

Rules where I am are you cannot touch your phone while the car is on, even if you have the handbrake on. That's because it means you aren't paying attention to the road, even when stationary.

ben9yu,NTA. But you’re seriously missing out on these fun events. It’s really so sad that your cousin did these awful things and put himself before you but you need to be an adult and confront him and either put it past you or move on and keep going to family events and keeping a distance.

benbm3,YWBTA don’t single people out like that. It’ll be more of a distraction if she keeps getting up and leaving.

As for telling your family I'm not sure that's the best idea, but if they somehow find out that you're ghosting your cousin then you can tell them if they ask. I just wouldn't go out of my way to tell them if it were me."

You’re an asshole if you tell her that she can’t see you when she visits unless she’s visiting *solely* to see you. That’s ridiculous when her *boyfriend* also lives there *and* it’s a 3 hour trip. You’re essentially telling her that she has to choose you or her boyfriend, and that’s how friendships and relationships end. 

Make plans with her but don’t sit around and just wait. If it comes time that she’s supposed to see you and you haven’t heard from her, go on with your day and do something else. Also, talk to her and tell her that her current behavior bothers you. If she texts/calls after you after you make other plans, you can go from there. But giving her that kind of ultimatum?

You're entitled to your own diet and that of your kids, but I think your reasoning is flawed and yes, potentially fucked up. It's a moral/ethical issue for you but there's a double standard. What about overfishing? What about the treatment of fish and the dumping of chemicals in the ocean? You're drawing a line that includes your girlfriend and potential wife/mother of your children on the other side of it."
beo7rn,"NTA. Your sister yelled at you and (deliberately?) injured you just for trying to drive. She hasn’t apologised to you and instead has only doubled down and further insulted and yelled at you. Maybe if she apologises genuinely you can eventually go back to giving her a lift to school (or other places) but you are certainly under no obligation to do so. She needs to dial down the entitlement and learn that actions have consequences.

If you do agree to drive her again at some later point. She needs to be clear on the fact that you will have the temperature and the radio the way you want and will drink coffee and do anything else you like in your damn car, and she should just be grateful for the lift. If she doesn’t like that, she can take the bus. Also obviously under no circumstances is she to put her violin case in the way of your brake, or find other reasons to yell or complain at you."

beog83,"NTA because it's your choice but you're setting a fine stage for some high-drama and bad feelings. May I suggest that just before you leave, you tell her that the future MIL will be there. That way, if your mom knows she's going to be an upset ass, she can just refuse to go and you can have a nice day. If you tell her and mom still goes but then grumps, you can at least say you warned her and expect her to act like an adult. How does your future MIL feel about your mom? Does she know what a Negative Nellie she's been? Will this event be setting her up too for suddenly feeling like she has to defend you and getting in an argument with your mom?"
beombr,"NTA, he may have been stressed and wanted to go work out, which is fine, but he may have included you in that before, and not the last minute.

I'd talk to him about how it was crappy that he didn't think to tell you that he wanted to hang out around 10, and not right after his conference call."

beos65,"ESH. Asking a woman “why didn’t you stop him?” inadvertently puts the blame and responsibility on her to stop potential predators

Too often, women are asked why they didn’t stand up to, or say no to, or fight back against, assholes who take advantage of women. It fails to acknowledge that if a man is already clearly doing something unacceptable, it’s fair to be afraid that they’d react poorly—or dangerously—to interference

A better thing to say would’ve been, “why didn’t you help her get home?” Or something like that. I know it’s a small nuance, but at least in my experience, it matters

That being said, your friend sounds like she was choosing to ignore that a drunk woman was in a potentially dangerous situation, which is shitty. We should always look out for on another and do our best to help, even if it’s not our fault or responsibility

It’s dumb she made it about herself. So, imo, everyone sucks here."

Anyway, my point is: follow the advices of those more qualified than you. Not doing so would be like going to your doctor, getting prescribed medicines but not taking them because ""nah, I know what's best for me!""

If you're so concerned about the advice received, maybe go to a different vet to hear a second opinion, but don't just ignore that"

beuxbi,"Who gets jealous over a clean house??

Based on what you posted NTA but are am I missing something?"
bev23u,"NTA, she sounds shitty to be around. Good for you and keep taking care of yourself.

&#x200B;

Also, I realize this is the least of your concerns with her, but... her idea of deep conversations is limited to ""space and stuff""? LOL, GTFO."
bev4ox,NAH. But leaving some batteries on the charger indefinitely can weaken them over time.

bev80f,[deleted]
bev8is,NTA. You're allowed to confide in your father. What he does with that information is his own decision.
bev9zt,NTA and I think a lot of the people saying you are an asshole are not Australians. Huntsman are good spiders and are known to be fantastic to have in your house and garden. You did your neighbours a favour if anything.
bevc4l,"NTA, it shouldn't be that an adult has to get an other adult to fill out an application with personal details like that."
bevglg,"As a gay dude trust me when I say this. Just let your son come out when he wants to. But start talking about gay rights, and drop hints that being gay is okay. So that when he does come out he knows you won’t kick him out.

Edit: I didn’t come out till I was 14 when I knew for a fact my family was totally okay with me being gay. But even though I knew I was going to come out to open arms. I still needed to do it in my own time, and when I was comfortable. If he knows you will still love and support him he’ll come out to you. Also thanks for not being a homophobic father, more if though need to exist."
bevhnf,"Find a different vet. She treats you terribly and it seems like she is unwilling to at least look into other options with you and instead keeps pushing for a very expensive, invasive procedure that doesn't have high success rates and limits a dog's quality of life for a year or more.

NTA."
bevi9w,"NAH

It would be NTA if you hadn’t said that he recognizes that it’s a frivolous thing to be arguing about, but from what you said it was a very low-stakes debate. I wouldn’t worry about it"
bevm20,NAH - Everyone grows at different speeds but you have every right to be concerned about what's happening.
bevtfd,"YTA, theres no reason to hide anything, i also don't understand why you needed closure with an ex from 4 to 5 years ago. Hes in the past and should stay there. Theres nothing wrong with having him as an acquaintance, but you shouldn't hide or neglect to tell your current boyfriend anything. it just appears shady, even if theres is nothing bad going on. How would you feel in his shoes?"
bevykj,"NAH. I just wanna provide a bit of advice, having been in a very similar situation. Sorry if it's a little long and hard to follow. I also lived in a dysfunctional family and am currently 18. My boyfriend and I moved in together last August (I moved into his place with him and his parents). We broke up one week ago. While we are on good terms and he is helping me until I get moved out, it doesn't go so well for everyone. My mom is my only option to move currently and while she isn't perfect, we are also on good terms, meaning I have her as an option. My point is, you will want to be on good terms with your family in the case that something unpredictable happens. You may think you guys will be together forever, but their concerns are very reasonable. Unless it is absolutely imperative that you leave now, do not burn your bridges and do not escape an overall safe environment. I would also STRONGLY suggest you at least wait until you're 18 to move out. I know it can be hard being in such an unpleasant environment, but you really need to be logical before you take such a huge leap. It is an incredibly huge stress to transition, even with support from my mom and ex. Imagine having to move immediately and having no backup and being a minor. I'm no expert, just some rando on the internet, so take this with a grain of salt... But I'd hate to see you stuck in a worse situation. Good luck with your endeavors!"

bew5ma,"NAH, you said how you felt, and cashier apologized. You are in the right, but if the cashier would've reacted differently the only ass hole would've been her"
bew82d,Just stop it before the beeps.
bewd2s,"YTA. Do it properly dude.

If you ask her, when the cinema trip is already arranged, it will make her feel super awks and she might feel forced into saying yes. Which is the worst possible start for a potential relationship.

Go to the cinema as planned and then, another time, ask her out for a drink."
bewdmj,"NTA. It's rude to bring uninvited people to a gathering, especially a small one, without asking the host. I don't know how much space you have or how many from the list came, but if there were a lot of people you could always say you have no more room for anyone who isn't on the list. Alternatively, you'd be in the right to tell them directly, too."
bewewr,"Wow, NTA at all! 

You handled yourself like an adult, because guess what? You're right! You're responsible for your daughter regardless of time of day, and you're being a good dad and an amicable ex. She on the other hand is acting incredibly childish and if she's blocked you then that's even worse. You should probably talk to her about how being a dad is a full-time job that you can't just throw away because the clock struck 7. Compromises need to be made. Don't let her guilt you and stand your ground."
bewfvx,"NTA.  
Please kick that woman out of your life, and maybe find an other therapist.  Being in a bad slot in life isn't an excuse to be an abhorrent human being, and I'm sure she would keep going till the day she die if you didn't snap. I got a relative like that, and so far I could safely conclude that people like that rarely change their heart; they just change the tactic so they could have some grip in your life again.  


I'm not therapist so I can't recommend you anything, but so far if your keep told you to  ""Let it go"" , then they pretty much would give no improvement for your case. It's equivalent with tell a sobbing person to smile."
bewi59,"NTA

Biphobia is very real in the LG “B” T community. It’s why I no longer associate with it"
bewiyc,NTA for being a picky eater if you prepare and get your own food. YTA if you expect them to cook separately for you all the time.
bewjr8,"NAH yeah it was a peace offering but the problem with peace offering who are not explicit (like ""Hey can we talk"") is you cant not always know. Go talk to him to explain yourself (or if you see him thank him and say you cant go because you have an other thing the same day)"
bewkkt,"NTA. It surprises me that your mum trusts you with a car and a job that doesn't finish until 1am, but won't let you sleep at home alone. Is it worth having a discussion with her about what her exact fear is? If you could find out, you may find it easier to calm her down."
bewl1m,"YTA. 

Unless the cashier tells you who is first, it IS a free for all. I would have laughed at you if you asked me to go first. You aren't special, buttercup."
bewmx1,"NTA - if you think things are going to get physical then you should always call the police. The police aren’t going to be pricks about it and they won’t even tell them it was you. If more people would act like you, there’d be a lot less domestic violence tragedies, so don’t worry about it."
bewn9w,Just here because I thought you said you bought a camel. Now I'm disappointed and must leave.
bewopb,"NTA. it's ok to say ""what's up with that""? and the way he freaked out certainly suggests you're onto something."
bewrj4,"NTA in the slightest. 

First, it's irrelevant *why* you quit. They can fire you for any reason, or no reason at all. You're free to walk for any reason, or no reason at all. You gave them two weeks' notice as a courtesy. 

Second, the way she reacted to this tells you all you need to know about how invested she was in your personal development. Good managers are happy for their people when they move on to bigger and better things. Shitty managers think only about themselves and their needs, and they take stuff like this personally because they know they're shitty managers and every departure raises the risk of exposure."
bewu0i,"YTA, but not for not wanting to be friends with him anymore. I personally think ghosting isn’t a very kind thing to do unless someone is harassing you or something of the sort. I totally think moving on from that friendship is a valid thing to want to do, but a chat about it wouldn’t have hurt. This is a pal of 4 years, ya know? He’s not a bad person. Unmotivated and possibly detrimental to your goals, sure. But not bad."
bex0r1,YTA- Ain’t no girl got any business sending pictures of herself to a married man. END. OF. STORY.
bex17m,"YTA - it’s not just her kid, it’s both your kid. You are just as much responsible for these appointments as she is."
bex2mp,"NTA.  What the hell is S even doing at college,? If he's doing no work and obviously unable to even take basic care of himself,  there's no way he should be at a higher education establishment and living unsupervised.  This isn't fair on anyone.  You're NTA for not wanting to be around him."
bex5ip,"I know I might be in the minority but NAH. She’s not wrong for wanting you to be with her but you guys are so young. Sometimes shit happens. I’m a military wife so I can tell you that there are many special occasions/days that my husband and I don’t get to celebrate together but you know what? The world just keeps on turning. We just celebrate those occasions earlier or later. I can see her feelings being hurt but to me this isn’t a crisis. Just go do the race and then you two celebrate each other’s birthdays when you can. And if she wants to break up over this, I’d say good riddance."
bexcty,"NAH. They made it clear with what the limit is, and you're honoring it. As long as you don't try to push that limit, then it's okay."
bexhje,"NAH; except maybe your future MIL. Holidays are for family, and you should feel comfortable with spending some of that time with your dad, even if most of it is just sleeping at his house."
bexmim,NTA - and a foundation of savings will go so much further for the two of you than a one night event. Down payment for a house one day?
bexn6l,"YTA, kinda. I know you want to help your country, but you have kids, a house, and a wife. Stay, and piss off ISIS by just living"
bexpcu,"NTA

She cut your plans short to get laid. Not great friend behavior when the only reason you even came out was she didn't take no for an answer."
bexqp8,No A-Holes here. You’re trying to work and you’re siblings are being irritating. Its what siblings do. Maybe investing in head phones or moving the tv would work.
bey45z,YTA.  The fuck is wrong with you?  Are you 5?  You know this kind of behaviour is unacceptable.  Grow up.
beyf0g,"NTA, especially since your fiancé wouldn’t even stick up for you on this as you’d previously discussed it. I can understand why his family would maybe be a bit sad, but they can’t just threaten or shame you into doing it. It’s your life, your name, and your choice."
beyhi7,"NAH, but in the future, you can always let people know (kindly) when you're not in the mood to chat."
beymsb,"NTA

This is YOUR wedding. And that's your choice, she has as much authority here as my left nutsack.

If you do confront her (which you should) don't got too hard, cause that can cause long-term rifts, but if you calmly explain it, she will understand, if not imediatley then in a few hours.

Your wedding, she has no business deciding on what your name is, it's such a small detail.

Tell her that if she loves you (she does) she should let you make some decisions on your own."
beypkg,NTA. But I think it's your responsibility to talk to Jamie about her actions. And you should make it clear that this is a fun league. Also it would be wise to tell the girls bringing this up that you will talk to her so they know your hearing their complaints.
beyscj,"NAH, but either you need to be more understanding or she should start taking steps towards adulthood.

You (understandably) want her to be more on her own feet since her reliance on her parents is impacting your relationship.  You are not an asshole for this.

She recognizes - correctly - that she is living at her parents' expense. If she pisses them off then it will have a major financial impact, which she might not be able to afford.  Part of living rent free is that she has given up some control, which will remain the case until she is prepared to live independently (and pay for her own stuff).  It is not realistic to expect her to act against her parents when the result might be dropping out of school to work."
beyt7c,"NTA - not sure who made your ""friend"" in charge, but you should probably just do your own thing for this tradition."
beyvnd,"NTA - you're not dating anyone, and neither is the person you're talking to."
beywq7,"NTA. I was gonna say ESH, but you gave him a damn month to go to the store and buy an extension cord. Jesus, he sounds like a child (also don't know why he goes to the store multiple times and doesn't get a cord)."
beyye5,"YTA because it sounds like you were expecting other students to confront the problem students and resolve the situation rather than you actually doing anything concrete...emails are an ineffective and quite passive way of dealing with a problem that you are just hoping will ""go away"" rather than actually dealing with the root of the problem

You have now affected innocent students negatively that may have even tried to do your job for you and said something to the others to no avail"
bez08v,NTA. LOL what even are they mad about? Do you really need to say something to a strangers kid just for bumping into you? Obviously the kid didn't mind that you didn't say anything so I'd say you're good man.
bez0uy,"YTA 

&#x200B;

Dude, when you destroy yourself, it hurts your parents deeply too. They demand you apologize to them because they feel like they spent so much time and energy raising you, and protecting you for you to throw it all back in their face. It may not be the right thing to take it as a personal insult, but what you're doing to yourself is also killing them."
bez3of,NTA. Its petty and i love it. You aren't hurting them or yelling back. You're just informing them that Dora the Explorer kills Thanos.
bez4ci,NTA. Not wanting your stuff to smell like weed is a perfectly valid request.
bez57a,"Undecided honestly, but if you have their phone number why don’t you just file a police report and press charges for them stealing your money?"
bezc09,"NAH - (edit)

INFO - How are you planning on canceling? I find that assholishness isn't always about the results, but what actions you take to get there."
bezhu3,"Nta, she lied to both you and her parents. Let them give her what she has coming to her."
bezj1p,"NTA, but I’m not sure there’s a clean solution unfortunately. You’ve addressed this again and again with your parents, and they’ve consistently ignored you while favoring your brother. That sounds like an incredibly frustrating dynamic, and one that breeds a lifetime of resentment. I don’t doubt that there’s been other issues- the driver license is probably just the most immediately visible. 

You’re going out to join the military, and you got your GED. You finally got a photo ID for yourself. All good things! I’m sorry they spent the last few years mocking you and giving you shit, but you’ll move on to better horizons soon. You sound self-sufficient and resourceful, so whatever you do you’ll go far. Good luck!"
bezj6i,YTA. If your roommate is paying rent and utilities he can let someone use his room while he’s gone as long as the guy is normal.
bezjdm,"NTA.  Don’t ever put yourself in an uncomfortable position just to please others, regardless of who they are."
bezl6o,NTA - How the hell are you being grounded at 19? Stand up has curse words in it 80% of the time. I'm not sure what they were expecting when they started watching it with you.
beznz9,NAH it’s important to have time to yourself to recharge. She’s just excited and wants your opinion. You’re doing a lot to help her and I hope she tells you how much she appreciates it.
bezqcg,"NAH - even though they couldn't see you, you were able to see your stuff at all times, right? And they're not the assholes since its constantly being hammered into us to report unattended bags on public transportation these days."
beztc2,"NAH  I understand your reasons for doing this, truly, but you need to stop.  As I assume that this is a recent thing (her going blind) and you are BOTH still adjusting to the realities (and the fear) that goes along with it.  I would come clean to your wife and tell her your fear has gotten in the way of your good sense and that you realize it was wrong, and you're going to work on it.  

I've been in a similar situation but you only get so long to come to grips with your fear, and then you have to stop letting it control you and your behavior.  That time has come."
bezuv1,"Yes YTA if you are just passively waiting for him to notice since he brought it up. Be an adult and have a conversation about it.

Not an asshole for not inviting him to be a groomsman though, that's just your personal prerogative and reciprocity isn't required at all."
bezxsb,"NTA- But you shouldn’t have thrown his backpack. 

Don’t pay for his surface pro until you know exactly what it was (really all you should have to pay for is to get it repaired but if you have the money and don’t want to deal with the hassle of getting him to admit he didn’t throw it out then buying a new one might just be easier). Don’t bother pay for his ripped jeans. 

Seriously talk with your wife about no longer letting him into your home. He sounds like nothing but trouble!"
bf040z,"NAH you were asked not to refer to them in a certain way and you complied, no one was a asshole."
bf04vw,"NTA. If you can’t handle being served, don’t dish it out."
bf0607,"NTA

You are under no obligation to give anyone a second chance. And with these circumstances, it just sounds like he just wants the fwb (although it seems he cares more for the benefits then the friend) back since he's out of a relationship."
bf067x,"NTA, you just vented to your friends about a difficult situation, they’re the ones that chose to confront her. And she isn’t entitled to your forgiveness or trust, if she wants that she can earn it."
bf06a7,"NTA. You should always report abuse if you see or suspect it.

However, it may be better to go through your school. Can you tell a guidance counselor?

Depending on their reaction (if they say they’ll call or if they don’t believe you), you can decide if you call CPS yourself

Wishing you the best"
bf06qz,[deleted]
bf06zx,"YTA. Their parents are getting divorced and you're the ""other woman"" you don't get to decide how they feel about that. Chances are they'll never like you. 

You're getting one side of the story from the previous marriage, you make his ex out to be a villain and I'd bet it's a gray area where they both did shitty things. 

You can be happy in your marriage and that's fine, but you can't expect his kids to like it."
bf0avs,"NTA.  Appropriate alcohol use should be modeled to children so they are raised understanding that it needs to be used responsibly.  Being left home with a 6 yo and a 10 yo, getting hammered, then bragging about it isn't responsible."
bf0d10,"NTA - You can't help how you feel about these things, but I think you should be open. Therapy isn't a bad thing, and could be really helpful for you."
bf0dnc,"NTA. You are a student, but don't forget you are also a customer paying for a service."
bf0ejw,"YTA. You took a grieving family post about a dead dog that everyone loved and made it about you.

&#x200B;

If your reputation is so fragile that people would honestly believe that about you, then you need to take a look at yourself.

You need to apologize to your BIL for being so insensitive after he did you a 10 year favor and did it with love for the animal."
bf0eys,"Sorry, but YTA if you insist on calling him Jakob. I understand that this may feel like a loss for you, but your relationship with your kid will be much better if you respect his wishes.

Also, Malcolm is a normal name that is not particularly difficult to spell."
bf0m2b,"NTA

Both parties in a relationship deserve to be happy. The timing sucks, but, you matter also. 

Now, if you had purposefully waited until exams to break up with her to cause distress, then my answer would be different."
bf0ny8,"NTA, you were upfront with him about being asexual. Sounds like he didn't understand what he was getting into and thought he could change your mind."
bf0o9q,"NTA, the “finally gone” piece leads me to believe that you were the last of many. Totally not your fault."
bf0pbn,"NTA 

I like how your mom is trying to put the same level of importance on a freaking *massage* as your surgery. It's, quite frankly, laughable."
bf0qg5,YTA - I'd feel hurt if I was asked to pretend I was my S/Os niece or sibling just to save a few bucks. I'd feel like I wasn't worth a goddamned amusement park ticket. Like my dignity is worth less than the few bucks you would be saving. You're the asshole.
bf0vcg,"NTA

 That is utterly ridiculous and entitling behavior. If what your saying is the truth OP you are not the asshole at all. Don't believe that for a second"
bf0y7z,"NTA 

Your child comes first, and especially with his disabilities, you have to protect him from what he can’t himself"
bf0z4j,"NTA. Your sexuality is part of your identity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Sounds like she wasn’t a keeper, so you dodged a bullet! Better to see if she accepts you for who you are early rather than waste your time beating around the bush."
bf1026,"NTA. You didn't lose out on the love of your life, you were going to break up with him anyway. Might as well profit a bit."
bf104n,"I definitely let her know before, it just wasn't until after we started physically going to places to look that I brought it up again. 

&#x200B;

And I started looking for places to live because a house is cheaper than the dorms. I don't get a free room like she does."
bf12n0,[deleted]
bf140x,"NTA - Dump them hard. I wouldn't be shy about why, but that's because I'm probably a jerk."
bf14or,"YTA- you're the asshole any time you physically touch (or keep asking to) another human being in that way when you know they don't want to be touched. Orientation doesn't matter. The kiss thing is just 100% crossing the line.

&#x200B;

They're concerned about your depression, they are probably good friends. Stop making them uncomfortable or you can count on that support vanishing."
bf155l,"NTA

Coming from personal loss, fuck people who text and drive. That she had children in her care makes it 1000x worse."
bf167g,NTA.  It sounds like he's trying to recruit you for a cult.
bf16um,"NTA for feeling a bit resentful for how this played out. Tell them how you feel. If you were that close, they should know what their actions did to you, and be given an opportunity to explain."
bf1ck7,"NTA, that lady is nuts. Even if it were an actual grave, people have picnics in graveyards all the time. My family has freakin family reunions in the family graveyard. The dead don’t mind."
bf1cuc,[deleted]
bf1hcl,"Nta. She’s literally saying “why should you give my daughter a present when you can buy things I want!?”  

Honestly though if you end up giving your niece the 3DS she’ll probably sell it."
bf1lbm,"YTA - Why not just say it's like the crappy mop some people use on their floors? What did the race of a hypothetical housewife have to do with anything? (And really, why did it have to a housewife at all?)"
bf1lqg,"YTA. You could offer to help her budget, but you can't tell her to do anything."
bf1qop,"I'm gonna go with YTA, mostly for doing it before he asked. Being asked and rejecting is a lot better than rejecting preemptively."
bf1r8k,"YTA for 2 reasons. 1) do what the customer asks and 2) not knowing it is ""my two cents""."
bf1uqt,"NTA: She should know who she is marrying, and decide for herself if ""temps"" are acceptable for her husband."
bf1wxn,"NTA

Rule of thumb: once someone unironically uses the words ""bro code"", you're free to disregard everything else they ever say."
bf1z4u,"NAH, you certainly aren't an asshole for having feelings, but your sister also isn't he asshole for finally picking a date after 4 years of engagement"
bf23no,"NTA, that's a ridiculous idea to suggest in front of a group of people IMO"
bf25s5,"NTA. You had plans and she completely disregarded them. That's rude. I wouldn't do that to a friend, much less to someone who I was interested in dating.

Sorry to say this but I think you were exactly right when you said she sees you as just a flirt. She probably just doesn't like the way that sounds, but it seems to be the truth.

My advice to you would be to back off and let her make the next move. If she *proactively* talks to you to try and schedule another date, then maybe she really does care about a relationship with you and maybe she's just disorganized or something. But if you back off and she doesn't really do anything, then that should tell you exactly how much she cares about being with you."
bf26je,"ESH:

>So this weekend, which was sprung up at the last minute, his parents told us that they **couldn't afford to pay me anymore** and that they were **going to Louisiana for the weekend to buy a boat house.**

what

The parents sound...questionable, but yeah what you're planning on doing is illegal. It's ""chaotic good"" at best."
bf29rs,"NTA, obviously. How could you be the asshole when you're not the one who did anything wrong? Any consequences of you telling him is consequences they've brought on themselves for being massive assholes."
bf2acs,"NTA- if he values sex over your mental stability, he is an asshole. What happened to ""for better or for worse""?

&#x200B;

No one is denying that sex and intimacy are a very important part of a relationship, but he needs to be patient. At the very least not try to make you feel selfish or guilty."
bf2b8p,"NTA:

Those students all sound really entitled. Your ""CA"" (not sure what that means) gets it."
bf2bg7,"NTA. I wait ten minutes and do exactly this. 

I don’t want someone doing it to me so I set a timer and make sure I’m back 1 minute before the washer is done!"
bf2e5e,YTA. The conversation is over and what she said was very mild. Although if she says something else sexist then you won't be TA for speaking up.
bf2eh5,"Woah. NTA. I would suggest counseling, because if someone was blatantly hitting on me like that I wouldn't need my husband to ask me to block. I get missing the friendship, but it's disrespectful to both you and this girl to continue a friendship under these circumstances. Cutting her out of his life may feel cruel but it's what she needs if she's this invested in an unavailable man."
bf2g3j,"NTA 

Why is your mother acting like you wanting a diagnosis is something you're doing *TO* her? Is she prone to making shit all about her?"
bf2gmu,"NTA. She is being childish and inconsiderate. Thats like if we go to an NFL finals game and shes asking how Football works.

Yes its just a show but people are very passionate about their TV shows in todays inactive, couch potato society.

And whats with the ""maybe i should get another boyfriend"" dude maybe you need a better girlfriend."
bf2hkb,"NTA but I think you know that deep down.
I've been there.
You don't know anyone anything.
The fact that Myra didn't text you herself and is talking through someone else speaks volumes.
Explain that this is some of the behavior you don't want.
Be honest.
Explain how you saw your old and toxic friendship, and tell her how you no longer wish to involve yourself in it. Some wounds can't be healed. Time doesn't always fix things.
Keep it brief and polite, and then I advise blocking both of them on any platform you can.
If it's anything like mine, she'll come back around and shit talk you on social media or send abusive texts. 😅"
bf2hmj,YTA if you aren't sexually attracted to her and keep leading her on
bf2j9n,NTA. sounds like they needed a wake up call. gotta love aggressively defensive parents tho lol
bf2l1b,"YTA for sure.

Normally I tell people they are entitled to break up with anyone at any time for any reason.

But *most of those posts doesn't involve the poster convincing their girlfriend to leave their job and move with them*.

You royally fucked this person."
bf2mwf,"NTA, you are 100% right if she is offended by your posts she can simply unfollow you. If she opens a dialogue to argue you are 100% allowed to argue your opinion."
bf2qgu,NTA - People getting irate because their partners masturbate and/or watch porn is ridiculous.
bf2rbu,"NTA.

What kind of backwards ass thinking is that? Straight people don't have to end every conversation with ""oh and by the way, I am heterosexual."" Gay people don't have to wear glittery capes that say ""GAY"" in big fabulous letters. Easy people don't have to walk around in assless chaps, and abstinent people don't have to walk around showing off their chastity belts like they're WWE Heavyweight Champions.

You can tell people what you want to, or not. Fuck them. You do you."
bf2ul1,[deleted]
bf2vkl,"NTA, be safe have fun."

So I worked with this moderately annoying chick for about a year in a very small 5 person office.
She flipped out on the boss and quit. I texted her a few times the next day and was being friendly and offering ideas of jobs, ect. The very next day my 7 year old dog was killed in front of us and I have been sad and not wanting to talk to friends/family, just working taking care of my kid basic life so I haven’t texted her. Two weeks go by and she texts be out of the blue she found a job. After congratulating her and asking where her job was, I mentioned that I was in mourning after losing one of my dogs. 
Two hours later she mentioned where she was working and asked how work was going without any mention of my dog. She has two dogs! She has heard me mention so many times how much I loved this dog. All I’m saying is she could have said sorry for your loss or acknowledgment of it. 
I never responded, she just texted me asking about her bill at work. I want to block her.  My husband said she could be a psycho and I should tell her what she did was wrong so she doesn’t freak out.
I want to block her and call it a day. WIBTA

She likely was working under the assumption that you would warm up to the dog and *want* to take care of it.

Honestly, it's kind of shitty that she even put you in that position. Dog's are a *lot* of responsibility, and she probably didn't realize how much work it takes to take care of them and raise them properly. So now she's burnt out and expecting you to help out, when you never agreed to that.

If you want to lend it anyway, then make it clear that if it's damaged in any way, he's responsible for paying you the full replacement cost.

IMO you don't want money to get between friends or family, and you should avoid it whenever possible.

Obviously, once you start deliberately not inviting a friend, she's going to be less of a friend to you, and if she somehow finds out, I'm sure you'll be less of a friend to her. If you're really not OK with this, then you'd have to invite her to prevent that from happening. But, at that point, you risk damaging your relationship with the others who think poorly of S.

bfa1e2,"NTA. You are entitled to the privacy of writing down your thoughts and expecting that it will stay personal. Not cool, Mom."
bfa4qv,NTA for not wanting to go. Seems like you have some good reasons for not wanting to go. But your dad has a hard-on for you going so you may not be able to get out of it.
bfa6p1,"NTA 
Your friends shouldn’t try to peer pressure you, and should accept that you don’t want to."
bfacqq,"NTA
Dude was a serious creep.
And the Facebook group is getting angry at the wrong person"
bfadk9,"NTA

You stated your personal boundaries and they are not respecting them. As well as most likely disrespecting their current relationship's boundaries. Maybe you want to block them for the time being."
bfaf4a,"NTA - no one has to carry on dating anyone they don’t want to, and can have any reason for leaving they want. I agree that the timing of him bribing this up is also a bit suspect, and I’d wager that he’s trying to guilt you into staying with him, especially if he knows for sure you’re not feeling it anymore. I’d be getting out of there."
bfagh9,"NAH. This is hard to judge, but ultimately I don't think anyone is being an asshole here (besides not giving you any info, that is not fair). I can see your ex-wife and family wanting to keep some stability through all this for your daughter by letting her still have her friends and school and such. I also understand that moving her permanently to you might be difficult for them because it might mean they have to face in a more real way the very real risk of your ex-wife passing. But I also 100% understand why you want your daughter to come live with you, you are her dad after all and will most likely, sadly, be her only parent soon. And if your daughter is alone a lot and has to take on extra responsibilities, then that is of course another important reason. 

I don't know where you live, but wouldn't the school year be over soon anyways? For your daughter it might be best to get to finish the school year in her current school and with her friends, and to start in a new school (where you live) next school year. That way you can also give the family of your ex-wife some time to mentally prepare for it.

Also, what does your daughter say about all of this? She is old enough to have an opinion and say in what she wants. Possible she might feel guilty about ""leaving"" her mom, and therefore feel she should stay, but have you talked to her about it?"
bfaibl,"NTA - dude, run for the hills! There’s so many red flags here, I’m not even sure what for, but none of it good.

For the record, you never have to be around anyone who makes you uncomfortable, and it definitely doesn’t make you an asshole."
bfamlj,NAH if you are upfront about it and let people know ahead of time. If you know that is your preference you definitely should ask if they have a pretty before you go over if you don't know for sure.
bfapbw,YTA - nice honey is expensive.
bfaxoo,"NAH. Family dynamics can be complex and so it’s hard to judge you for your outburst. You shouldn’t have yelled in a public place at your parents but it’s also a common experience  we all have (frustration and regret with our upbringing). 

You have sincere sympathy OP. That’s sounds tough and I recommend a therapist, for you and maybe even for your parents. There definitely more there that needs to be discussed and worked through, but acknowledging an issue is the first step, and maybe the toughest. 

Good luck!"
bfaztf,"NAH. It was an honest error. Also, it would only have been bad if you'd intentionally won by a large margin. Disabled kids don't have to win every single time - it's okay to lose occasionally to a team. Don't stress about it. But consider other ways you can give back - hold a hockey skills clinic for these kids? Volunteer with a special olympics team?"
bfb01c,NTA you are entitled to recline your seat on a long haul flight.  The woman should have stopped asking after the first time.
bfb17y,"NAH - It's your wedding, you get to decide what's what."
bfb6p7,NAH but the idiot who yelled. Seriously sounds like she wanted to do one thing and everyone else had another idea. This is when someone should have stepped up said hey I got a playlist or something
bfb7et,NAH. You aren't obligated to share your food.
bfb7p7,[removed]
bfbax3,"ESH it sounds like she could work on her communication skills, but you can’t expect to hog such a valuable space for 3 hours - that’s inconsiderate too"
bfbbd1,"YTA - wtf dude they're your parents, have some respect. When I read that you payed off the mortgage I though that you did a great thing... for your parents. Not that you're basically kicking them out of their home.

I could never and would never do such a thing.

I'm not even sure how you can ask if you're an asshole with a straight face, are you really that self absorbed?"
bfbg5f,"YTA. A pretty big asshole. She very reasonably explained that it wasn’t about controlling your time, just explaining that you wouldn’t make it so she wasn’t sitting around waiting for and worrying about you, you admitted you’d be even more pissed if the positions were reversed, and then for some reason you doubled down and were an even bigger asshole. I don’t blame her for leaving and you have a lot of apologizing to do. And should also probably do some reflection to figure out why on earth you would try to sabotage the relationship instead of apologizing (and honestly, instead of texting when you went to get drinks instead of coming home in the first place)."
bfbhz8,"ESH

You could have just deleted him from Facebook, instead of engaging. He's not a close friend at all.

He's an asshole for falling into that crowd so hard."
bfbj77,NTA - go spend your time off with people you actually like.
bfbkyw,NTA cause like... it's just eggs.. your family sounds super insecure. I don't even understand why an underage person would be expected to go get eggs. Why is there all this egg drama?
bfbpv7,"You can't control your biology, but you can control what you say and how you say things."
bfbqi7,"ESH. How is this going to end? She’s misinformed (and I’m assuming inexperienced), you’re looking for a weird way to tell your dick size to the internet, and you two aren’t communicating like adults."
bfbyi3,NTA. It's exactly the same as her talking about other guys or you talking about other women. If you are uncomfortable with her talking about it then you are 100% not TA for asking her to stop.
bfbyja,"NAH - I can understand from your Dad’s perspective that you look like TA but that’s because he clearly doesn’t understand what you’re doing. That said, if you’ve got guests over, I’d suggest not gaming. I know it’s difficult when you’re a competitive gamer, but real life should always come first (one of my mantras when I used to game competitively)."
bfbzi0,"NTA. Yes she can’t help herself urinating all over the room but she can still clean it up. She doesn’t have to have her urine build up such a toxic smell that everyone has to deal with it, disability or no disability. And considering how the honors dorm is supposed to be nicer since you worked harder, you shouldn’t have to deal with daily suffering from somebody who isn’t supposed to be there."
bfc4dj,NTA. They are all a bunch of douche bags and get away with it because people don’t stand up to them.
bfc8ze,NTA you need better friends
bfc9c6,"NAH. I don't think the other student knew of your autism and, in any other case, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. With your diagnosis, I'd talk to the teacher and have an assigned spot so there's no problems in the future."
bfccbe,"NTA - in the UK the tipping culture is very different to the US. We actually pay servers a liveable wage, whereas in the US tips are used to supplement income so servers can afford to live. There is absolutely no requirement or expectation to tip over here, and I only do it when I feel the service has been excellent."
bfckma,"NTA, but this could have been handled better. I think you overreacted to what was probably just a flippant remark, rather than something designed to ""put you in your place"", so to speak. Learn that sometimes the better option is to nod and smile and turn the other cheek rather than engage in an argument."
bfcldd,"NAH - it’s a very sentimental item and while you really wanted your gf to enjoy it, in the end it is a normal worry."
bfcv2g,"NTA.

He had debts and he paid them. His mother is the asshole for thinking her son didn't have to pay what he owed."
bfcw3f,"NTA 

Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.

You are being used for your money."
bfczn2,"NTA entirely; however, from the little context I have I think that you may have been bottling up your feelings towards your friends and then just exploded when you couldn’t take it anymore. From their perspective that would just look like a random outburst and I think you might need to have a full conversation with them so you’re all on the same page."
bfd386,ESH. Yeah they were assholes for leaving you out like that. But I think you overreacted a little by cutting ties with them so abruptly. You should've had a conversation with them and been honest with how they made you feel. Maybe it really was just an honest mistake but they didn't think you'd be that hurt by it. Now you don't get to have that conversation because you already distanced yourself.
bfdbeo,"NTA: you come first, sounds like a toxic friendship you should’ve been out of long ago
Edit: spelling cause im a mobile user lul"
bfdfc8,"NTA

Bodily autonomy is a thing"
bfdfvh,"NTA. You had your earphones in. Unless you were looking up and rotating 360 degrees, you’d have no way of knowing she was there.

I often wear wireless ear buds when I’m in an office working, on the subway, and even at home, so my music, podcasts, etc., isn’t disturbing the people around me. If someone says “hi” to me, I’m not going to hear them unless I’m looking at them. 

I think your sister was trying to start drama where there was none."
bfdhu4,"NAH, except for the bf obviously. I understand your frustration and it is your own choice if you want to leave your friend to the situation if she clearly doesn't want your help. But being in an abusive relationship (which is what this sounds like) is also really hard for the person being in it and since he is manipulating her it is probably hard for your friend to understand your reasoning when you try to help her. I would say just be patiemt and be there for her when she does actively seek help but if you are fed up with her bitching that is totally understandable and again your decision to tell her off for that."
bfdjcy,"NTA it sounds to me like she’s being kind of hypocritical. You still had to pay half when she got her money, so why do you have to pay the full cost when she didn’t have to? That’s not fair. I understand why she would want to keep her savings but the agreement was 50/50 and always has been."
bfdmd8,"ESH - I’ll give you sympathy where it’s due; the guy should have been more aware and listened to what you were saying. A lot of people would consider it rude

However, it would have been better if you just walked away with your child. No need to blow a fuse. Just been on your merry way with your grocery shopping"
bfdojd,"YTA. It may have been a bit rude, but cutting out a friend for something a BIT rude their boyfriend said is a way overreaction"
bfdrdo,"NTA- It's your $2 that you have a legitimate need for.

bfdspj,"People will make the connection- he's one of the most well-known superheroes.

That said, Peter Smith is innocuous enough to not get questions and people will probably just slightly chuckle when the learn about ""Parker."" The name is perfectly fine and shouldn't be an issue."
bfdu2e,"Yeah pretty clearly ESH. People vent, sometimes they vent to their parents - he's the only one here who is not an asshole though. 

His parents are assholes for getting this involved in his personal life in a really inappropriate manner, that's frankly disgusting and he deserves to know that they did shit like that

You're an asshole for letting yourself be bought out solely because you don't think he should talk about your relationship issues with anyone, which is absurd

He probably blocked you, which you deserve."
bfdvvh,NTA  Being married doesn't mean you lose the right to independence and time with friends away from your spouse.  Your wife needs to work on her issues and you need to assert your right to have time without her.
bfdy1w,Hahaha. NTA. This is creative and low-harm. I say do it.
bfdzb4,NAH. New baby is an adjustment and she probably got cabin fever.
bfe1tm,"ESH. He's clearly an asshole, we agree there, but in your conversation, you're being unnecessarily inflammatory. 'You're 18, you can't really say that'? Really? Don't socialize with him if you don't want to, but you're also an asshole here."
bfe1wb,"It would also depend on noise bylaws. I think most of them kick in around 11, but it could be as early as 9-10 depending on where OP lives."
bfe24x,"YTA. You bought your girlfriend a vacuum cleaner for her birthday. Even if she wanted it, you still gave her something to do chores with. On her birthday."
bfe287,"NAH.  What you saw was suspicious.. but not obviously criminal, and there was at least a plausible explanation.  It was a judgement call in a gray area.  

You probably got it wrong, but it's not one where you obviously should have known different."
bfe2zb,The f1 started to ignore us with my circle of friends because we're not really in good relationship with f3 which f1 favors. The whole circle of friends were not talking to f3 except f1 because they were best buddies and started to lie more frequently that damages the whole circle of friends and f2 has good intentions.. f2 lies because f2 wanted to fix f1 relationship with everyone else but f3 is completely blocked off now. I should be calling f3 = exf3. Anyway f1 started lying way before this exf3 happened.
bfe4bu,"NTA. Sounds like your husband was thinking more about his needs than anyone else. I could understand him being disappointed having been looking forward to a toddler free evening, but it is immature for him to be having more of a tantrum than the one he imagined your toddler would have."
bfe5ix,"I say NTA. Someone with the emotional range of a 13_14 yr old won't understand the emotional aspects of sex on her own, and she needs to be safe if she's having sex."
bfe6ae,NTA Your dad sounds like an a-hole and I say good on you for not putting up with that shit
bfe8xl,"NTA. What the hell? These people don’t live in your home and don’t pay rent! What gives them the right to take up common spaces that you need to use?! Let alone destroy your expensive belongings and then bitch at you for confronting them about it?! You need to develop a backbone and stick up for yourself. This is your home and your roommate’s guests should not be imposing on or inconveniencing you!

Why are you living with a guy who treats you like this?! They are all huge assholes! Move out yourself or if you can, kick this roommate out and get a new one who has some basic respect!"
bfefw6,You need to post in the relationships sub or something similar. You know you’re obviously NTA but what you’re really seeking is advice on how to grow a backbone and communicate with your roommate in order to set appropriate boundaries.
bfeh3l,NTA at all. Sounds like she wants to use you as a baby sitter. That's not a vacation at all.
bfehft,"NTA. It's unfair for him to expect you to spend all your time with HIS family, especially if you're not doing anything special. You should go enjoy your time with YOUR family, and let him go do nothing with his."
bfelh0,"NTA. He's making excuses, not really apologizing. I'd tell him you that you feel he isn't sincere and what he did not only hurt your mom, but you, as well. If he really apologizes, takes responsibility and owns up to it, then you should accept it. I hope your parents can work through this, I've known couples that have."
bfemnl,"NTA

You accepted you were wrong so why do they feel the need to mock you? Let 'er rip OP."
bfemob,"NTA. And it isn't your fault this girl is a manipulative cheater.

>we are still talking as friends just because i cannot live without her

You need to learn to live without her, the longer you stay """"friends"""" with a toxic person the harder it will be to disconnect. She's not worth it"

bfev7s,"NTA- Teacher is an asshole in my opinion because either way, your friend didn't know certain things. You helping doesn't change what he did and didn't know. I get not wanting you to butt in, but he could have addressed that then and there. A simple ""I need <friend> to answer alone."" would've worked.

&#x200B;

Giving you a lower grade than your friend after the fact just seems spiteful."
bfeytp,"NTA

I was so sure this would be a YTA situation and yes technically they should be on there but honestly, fuck them. They don't seem to have done anything for your mother in the last few years, it has all been on you. If they want their name on an obituary for your mum they can write it and pay for it themselves."
bfezen,"ESH- your family sucks, fiance sucks and you suck. But I have so much sympathy for you because I want you to be able to get that Visa and be happy."
bff2dc,"NAH.  It's a hygiene product.  You could go to the bathroom and wash up, but it's not okay to use someone's hygiene products without their permission.  Spray deodorant is a different story because it doesn't make contact with the pits."
bff7si,"NTA. Speaking as someone with autism who got a diagnosis at the age of 42, I wish I had known earlier. If I had known age 6, my life would have been very different. I would have made better decisions for myself, and I would have probably avoided some crappy situations. The sooner he knows, the sooner he can get the support he needs...assuming your ""diagnosis"" is accurate."

Women are never under the obligation to change their name.

It's not just your ex's last name. It is YOUR name. Your reasons are all good ones. Tell him you are keeping your name and the reasons why. 

It also doesn't matter what ""most people"" think. You like your name, keep it."
bffa3d,Info was that the entire conversation? Where did you tell him he has no friends?
bffcla,"ESH

You could have handled it better. He's still just a child. 
The dad could have too though. You both need to try and talk about this again when emotions are calm and apologize to show your kids how you're supposed to deal with conflict ."
bffg4y,"NTA , she had other people that helped her you had no need to help in that situation."
bffi74,ESH. You don’t get to control who your gf talks to and she also lied to you.
bffkuy,"NTA

Nowhere in this story did you do anything wrong.  She just acted like a royal, selfish asshole a multiple points.  Her making your dad's life a living hell for 500+ days after this is fucking insane, but in no way falls on you."
bfflcq,"NTA  He's expecting you to lie to your mother to cover his ass.  That makes him an asshole, not you.  Plus, he did tell you that he told her.  Now, I totally believe he doesn't remember it that way because of the weed and the throwing up.  But that doesn't make his stance any better."
bfflms,"YTA but in a very small way.  Yes, your father's going to try to help.  But he has his own life and the chickens are your responsibility.  Plus, pulling the ""I can't do this because I'm a weak woman"" card is wrong.  Wear better gloves and get digging."
bffn12,"So your dad thinks you will never amount to anything because you don't feel like seeing The Goddamn Music Man? A bit extreme.

Do you even like musicals? I personally wouldn't invite someone to something like a musical, opera or postmodernist art exhibition unless I 100% knew they liked that sort of thing.

If it was something more neutral, like a dinner, I'd say ESH. But this sounds like NTA to me."
bffo14,"NTA, toxic family don't deserve a place in your life just because they're family. Live your life and don't be guilted into contact with toxic people."
bffq0g,"NTA, but I think you should tread carefully as it's not really worth the breakdown of a healthy relationship that you seem to have with him. You'll get more milage out of it if you take the piss out of him for it. I would suggest letting it slide, but how about you make a point of buying him really bad whiskeys for his birthdays!"
bffqoc,"NTA

That's the precise level of passive aggressive appropriate for the situation.  Calling her out directly might have been a step too far, what you did was perfect.  Plus it's a great teaching moment for your own kids"
bfftdk,"NTA

Sounds reasonable. Worked hospitality and it's incredibly stupid how lazy some are, and how then you pay the price and have to pick up after them. She shouldn't be getting more tips than she's worked for, maybe instead of whining she could actually put some effort in."
bffuko,"INFO + NAH. If you're relationship with your mother isn't complicated and you aren't harbouring any ill feelings then I will say: your mother won't be here forever.

A mother who wants to spend time with her child isn't being unreasonable and is such a lovely thing to see.

I understand that you wanna hang with mates your own age but that doesn't mean you can't hang out with your mum, ya know?

You can hang out with your mates anytime, all the time. You only get one mum and a small time to spend with her and build memories.

It's unlikely the friends you have now will be there for you in the future but you can always count on your mum.

&#x200B;

If you have a strained relationship and she has been awful to you, then disregard everything I've said."

bffwcf,YWBTA for taking money from a company that has nothing to do with your purchase
bffwhp,Her mother died of a heart attack. Unless your girlfriend visited her mother with a syringe full of adrenaline or cortisone I'm not sure why you would think she could induce a heart attack. Please explain further why you think she had the means.
bffyqn,"NTA. That's such a douchebag move and a dumb rule. Ofcourse you need to help out but you can't not feed your children if they didn't help out. Especially if they weren't even there. Yeah there's other food, but it's still bullcrap. What if you weren't there for a longer time? Do you just get no food at all? Ridiculous"
bffzug,"NTA for refusing her another week, but ESH for how this whole thing has played out.

In future, young immature guests such as this need to be explicitly told clear expectations in advance as to what their role is (e.g. are they expected to join the household in outings and meals? are they expected to help cook meals and clean up after themselves? are they expected to bring money to help pay their expenses?) and what they are and are not allowed to do (are they not allowed to shut themselves in their room? are they expected to go easy on the A/C?) 

During the week your GF should have spoken up and told her her behavior was unacceptable rather than accommodating every whim like she's an entitled princess.

Why is she not in school? Where are her parents in all this? Why didn't they send her with money for food?

You were wrong to lie about the reasons you aren't having her back for a second week. Be honest: we were extremely disappointed with how disrespectful you were of our time and resources. We did not enjoy having you and unless you decide to be a better guest we won't be inviting yo you back in future."
bfg2qg,"NTA

Having a dog is a major, major, major decision.  Both from a financial perspective and a time perspective.  Especially a puppy.

If your dog is the same size as mine (60 pounds) you'll be spending around 7 hours worth of work a month to pay for thd food and maybe 2-3 extra hours for supplies.  Plus all the time spent training (and wow to puppies take a **ton** of work) and caring for the dog.

Your wife just unilaterally made the decision for you to work 10 extra hours a month + 30-60 hours actually walking and training and caring for the dog.  That's a lot ofn fucking time for her to unilaterally decide to take from you.  Thats not cool."
bfg36q,"NAH, as long as you handle it delicately. I wouldn't just come right out and say ""everyone hates you because you talk too much,"" but if you can couch it more as ""you shouldn't be chit chatting so much on the job because it's bad for productivity"" or something like that it can be more palatable. Make it more about the job or something outside of her rather than a ""her"" problem. Telling someone that everyone complains about them is too soul-crushing to be helpful, IMO."
bfg3zq,"YTA - You wanting a dress and him not thinking that’s wise is called a difference of opinion. They happen and financial decisions like this are always difficult. However, turning around and calling him cheap is an ad hominem and completely toxic to relationships. Imagine if he called you names because you “need a new dress to feel good about yourself?” Or called you names like “shallow” etc.  because your self worth is attached to material things? 

This name calling is completely asshole behavior. Especially since you’re calling someone “cheap” who was supporting you financially up until a couple months ago. Someone who supported you even though by your own admission you “needed to curb your spending.” Someone whose financial support likely indirectly helped you achieve your job since you could focus on education, skill gathering, and/or job hunting etc. since your finances were handled. 

Splitting all finances right down the middle (including rent, etc) might be a good idea for a variety of reasons, but you two need to work on your communication big time."

I honestly don’t go to church anymore despite having gone for years with my mom. I’m just in the youth group now at the new church but I don’t attend every week. I think you’re fine.

While it’s technically an all-ages event, she should realize that in an event where people are literally beating the shit out of each other, there will probably be cursing as well.  It’s not your responsibility to parent her child and prevent him from cursing - That’s HER job."

You have every right to be upset, hurt, and angered by their neglect of another living creature, one that they know you care for very much. Propriety goes out the window for emergencies like this. I hope someone finds your dog!"
bfh1xm,"NTA, it's your wedding shower; not theirs."
bfh7qt,I don't see how this is even a question. NTA.
bfh9p9,"NAH, if you can't get over it then best to distance yourself before you subconsciously sabotage her happiness with potential future partners. You should try and get over it though, sucks to lose a friend for these reasons."
bfhc2t,"YTA. She didnt ask you for your comment, why would you say it?

&#x200B;

There's a difference between welcome constructive criticism and telling a girl she looks bad in her picture"
bfhe9u,"NTA - You provided a defensible opinion on the matter, and your tonality seems neutral.


YWBTA if you had said something like “They’re massive losers in life so the only poo-nah-nee they can get is make believe in their delusional minds. Jeez you’re such an IDIOT for supporting them!!!1”"

Hey, I'm the guy who mentioned this in the other post.  I also don't like calling people an asshole for breaking vague social regulations, but the structure of the sub makes me say ""You're the Asshole"".

Here's where I'm coming from.  I don't think the location matters where you're flying out from matters.  The plane itself is the same no matter where it embarks.  It's still a tube with recycled air.  There are still a hundred people crammed in next to you.  

Secondly, I'm not saying your feet smell, but there are definitely people out there who have keener senses of smell than your husband and family.  The bare feet smell bother somebody.  I promise people have smelled it.  

Third, an airplane is a public space and a public means of transportation.  There's a consideration aspect to it.  It's not acceptable etiquette to go barefoot on a plane.  It's also against most [airlines' terms of service](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/support/conditions-of-carriage.jsp#AcceptPass), albeit who actually enforces that.  

Slippers and socks are 100% appropriate, so again, if you're willing to switch into socks during the flight that will make you not the asshole."

bfhisf,"NAH. Of course your-wedding-your-rules, I get that. 

&#x200B;

However, 3 months is very, very little notice for a whole family to plan a trip several states away."
bfhmku,"NAH. I think it’s perfectly okay for you to say, “Hey Mark, I went to the group and I didn’t notice any creepy behavior but I did notice that the newer people had a hard time jumping into the conversation. They’re probably all shy so maybe you should try to do more “get to know you” type of convos and see if that helps the return rate.”"
bfho3z,"YTA.

He doesn’t like horror movies.  Calling his fear “irrational” is dismissive and selfish.  Unless he specifically asks for your help, leave him alone."
bfhx1o,NTA but just wondering why so many people don't discuss shit like this *before* getting married.
bfhxco,NTA and for the record your grandma is NOT a saint.
bfhybc,"NAH honestly. I've seen many similar family situations and you probably will never see eye to eye. Doesn't make anyone an asshole until they start getting toxic/vindictive over it, the biggest asshole here is religion (and that includes atheism to be honest) itself."
bfi19k,"NTA, but perhaps you could have done your mom the courtesy of asking/discussing this with her first?"
bfi4zn,"NAH - I understand you wanting to spend time alone with your dad, but if he is constantly busy during the week, his other children probably with they had alone time with dad, also.  Realistically, with 5 children in the house and 3 of them being small, it is very difficult to get alone time.  Instead of asking him to spend the weekend with only you, maybe set up a 2 hour time period once a month where you and him (or you, him, and sis) get to do stuff alone with him."
bfi7yg,"NTA, that’s the definition of rape (non-consensual sex)."
bfi9hr,">  I feel like I'm ruining their fun and that I'm controlling them.

Because you are. YTA."
bfi9x4,Ok and?

Let me start off with: Ltl and FTP 

&#x200B;

I know this guy, let's call him W. I've known W for 2 years. We started hanging out sort of regularly and he seemed great. Recently, however, W has been a huge dick. We're both disabled and i remember him saying that he's tried being friends with the ""Normal"" (Able-bodied ) kids but no one likes him, disregarding that i was right there.

&#x200B;

He also acts like this girl he has the hots for is his ONLY friend, never stops talking about her as if she's all he has in life, interrupts my conversations, takes food from me, and just disregards me generally. So one day, i went off about how much he sucks and now everyone's saying i'm an ass

AITA?
