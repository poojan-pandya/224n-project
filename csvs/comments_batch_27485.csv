*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
bfigy3,"YTA. When people are excited about something, raining on their parade is not cool. You gotta let go of that bitter betty attitude surrounding weddings if more of your pals are going to get married.

I don't have advice on how to fix it, sorry. There are subs like r/relationshipadvice that would be helpful"
bfih9d,"NTA. I won’t really get into details on how your dad is not an asshole when it came to choosing friends to hang with because that’s what a parent can do. But I will say he doesn’t respect you at all and he bad mouths you a ton. So no, you got your shit together so distance yourself from them. And I mean no contact to all of them."
bfii8a,"NTA- Your body, your rules. It's okay to set boundaries with people, even if those people are your family."
bfii8q,"NTA - it was really unfair of him to spring that on your in front of your daughter, and I’m sure he would have known that when he did it."
bfije6,NTA. You can’t help if you feel indifferent about someone you didn’t have a relationship with
bfiqlc,Honestly? NTA because your mom literally accused you while knowing fully well it couldn't had been you because you were in Virginia with her and her boyfriend. Even an sensible adult would had flipped out on your mother for being falsely accused and the way she was ranting off...
bfir4w,"NTA. 

don't the Nazis also hate gays???? That's some cognitive dissonance at best, Bruce McArthur-ism at worst"
bfiuca,"ESH i feel bad for your sisters and,  in all honesty,  your brother too. The whole thing sounds messy.  But here's the thing,  those kids are still going to be your siblings long after your parents are gone.  Make the kid a little Easter basket, it doesn't have to be a big thing.  You didn't say how old they all are so I don't know how long this may go on but the baskets don't have to be big. Be the bigger person in this group."
bfivxs,"NTA. You tried to do the right thing and were unfairly accused. I don’t blame you for removing yourself from the situation. That said, if you still feel guilty, make a charitable donation of $12 and balance out your karma."
bfix42,"NAH

>I’m very angry with my parents for forcing me to apply to med school.

You're an adult. You're responsible for your own decisions."
bfiz6h,YTA. Never reuse an engagement ring. You could have had your grandmothers stone put into a new setting for your fiancé. Nobody wants to look at their engagement ring and know their SO gave it to someone else first.
bfizna,"NTA but could definitely be handled better. Think this way - his daughter is leaving him, to a place that he (may or may not truly) believe is dangerous, or at least has that potential. He's probably spent more time with his daughter than you with your wife. He just sounds like a super worried parent to me. May be sit down with him and address his concerns one by one once you are both calm? If it helps, do it with your wife present, she's on your side."
bfiznp,"NTA she seemed to be using him, charity will appreciate it more than her IMO."
bfj0f4,"YTA for assuming that because you feel a certain way for a girl that she should instantly eject all of her emotional baggage and be with you. Was she really flirting with you or was she just acting friendly towards you? I don't think you can count a kiss when you were all drunk as evidence that she sees you as anything more than a friend. She doesn't owe you anything. You can't turn off emotions, its fair for her to still have feelings for someone else. A bit ESH if she really was flirting with you when she knows she's not emotionally invested in you but there are so many times guys take a friendship and see more when there's not."
bfj2lz,"NTA for asking, but .. could probably have phrased it a bit nicer.

You catch more flies with honey and all ..."
bfj3y8,"NTA

You're the kid. She's the parent. It isn't up to you to comfort your mother."
bfj4ds,NTA.  She's firing you for not being a good enough free therapist.  This is to your benefit.  Friendship isn't about one person being a permanent support beam in someone else's life.
bfj4l8,"NAH, maybe I'll get for that but.. Her behavior is obviously not acceptable and she actually acting like the A here, and I'm not a doctor but it doesn't sound like she can help it/is responsible for it in this case. Obviously you aren't equipped to handle it, nor should it necessarily be put on you. I get that she's a grown woman, have you tried to talk to her about getting more help than she's getting, because it sounds like she really needs it. Also (you know better than I, and I understand she's a grown woman) but it almost seems like the situation could warrant getting her parents involved, there are places you can go away to for a while that specialize in that sort of trauma and the PTSD that could follow that (the right ones are very nice and not like jail and not like looney bins). Good wishes for all involved, that really sucks all around."
bfj538,"NAH. I don't blame you for not wanting the ring, but I also don't blame him for giving it to you. If he truly doesn't have any sentimental value attached to it like you say, then it makes sense he'd want to give it to someone he loves vs. getting rid of it. You're also totally right to not want it though, would be hard for anyone to overlook the ring's history."
bfj5rz,"NTA, but coming from a young brother I think it would be bad to leave your young brother with your mom. Right now your probably tge only good influence on him. And without you he will have to take care if his mom by himself. For his sake I would wait till hes old enough."
bfj68s,"NTA

>she said she was just trying to get people to text her. 

There are better ways to seek help for depression than to get a bunch of thirsty guys hitting her up. She's looking for attention, and social media is just going to get her in trouble again. Then again, you can't stop her from going onto social media when she turns 18, so this might all be moot."
bfj7q9,"NTA. Your dad seems very abusive, and narcissistic. If your sister's and adult, and lives on her own, your dad has no right to know where she lives, if she doesn't want him to know. It really sucks that you got kicked out, I don't think you did anything wrong. That being said, considering how much your father escalated this situation, and I'll assume this isn't a first time thing considering that both you and your sister bailed on the family dinner, getting away from him may be a blessing."
bfjdk8,"NTA, but you shouldn’t think this is just some “juvenile” response to being broken up with. I understand it may appear that way, but I feel confident it goes deeper than that. However, you are under no obligation to stay friends, or deal with this bs going forward"
bfjg2i,"You’re Not the A-hole imo 
seems like you just made a comparison to hopefully get her to understand her actions. It not like you were saying anything bad about the mom or bashing her."
bfjhg1,"NTA, you provided far more than your fair share and are cheated on? I'd be livid.

Edit: it comes across as you being used. Smart move to get out of that situation.

And if her situation is gonna end up being so devastating, she should have thought about the consequences of something like cheating."
bfjim8,"NTA, your mom is a little whack. Buy whatever the fuck you want lol"
bfjp7u,NAH. Just give her plenty of warning.
bfjrph,ESH but this kinda just seems like bait so I'm thinking potentially it's a shit post.
bfjsp8,"NTA because she kept nitpicking on you. However, I think there could have been a better way to tell her that it was too noisy because she might have felt embarrassed that it happened in front of her friends? Or she hasn't seen her friends in a long time and you ""killed the mood""? Try to ask her about what has made her mad."
bfjsva,"NTA, clearly. They tried to take advantage. They told you roundabout what the renovation would entail, then did waaaay more shit than that.

Edit: also rather assholey of them to act entitled to your money at all.

Edit again: 13k?!?!?! I guess I'm not surprised, they ripped out walls and stuff... but that is sooooo much more than you should be required to gift to your sister."
bfjtlu,"NTA, lol do not let anyone ever tell you that you were an asshole here. I was expecting this to be a case of your granny making a sly homophobic joke or something and you freaking the fuck out. Definitely NOT what happened here.

That woman clearly doesn't know what love is, don't even bother trying to explain yourself.

---

why did you delete and repost this?"
bfjudv,NAH as long as you keep the drawings to yourself.
bfjvje,"YTA for not considering these things when you agreed to take on responsibility for another living creature, it was cool for a few months and now you’re bored of it? Yikes"
bfjx62,"YTA. I get why you did this but it wasn't your place. Learning disabilities don't mean you're incapable of handling yourself... For all you know this was a big step for her and you just completely ruined it.

edit:

I didn't even think of the potential outing of her you just did either. Come on..."
bfjxze,NTA but you might be to your husband if you both don't move out and live just the two of you.
bfjykm,"NTA

Eh, this one is weird and verges into legal territory, but I agree with you that things on r/writingprompts don't have any more intrinsic legal protection than tweets do. Plus, I'm assuming nothing the AI produces can be traced back to a specific post? If that's the case, then I'd say you haven't done anything wrong."
bfk24l,"NTA for wanting to sit out out at all, they sound like a lot lol. YWBTA if you committed already and bail though."
bfk2am,"ESH. Mostly because he just said ""find a better paying job"" instead of having an actual discussion on how expenses are handled between the two of you. Provided your finances are still separate (IE: no joint bank account, which is probably smart after only 6 months of cohabitation), 50/50 split is fair. I'm sure that living together combines more expenses than just the rent itself, and these types of discussions are part of a relationship. Not a good sign if you can't work out something this simple."
bfk3e0,NAH except J. You are taking steps to protect yourself and your gfs mom is reaching out to Q who must be going through an unfortunate time in her life. Unless your gf or her mom attempt to pressure you or make you feel bad fir not going then they WBTA.
bfk503,NTA who the hell brings giants tubs of rice and beans only for themselves to a baby shower ??  I can absolutely see this same thing happening to me and I would've been mortified and pissed simultaneously.
bfk6bj,"NTA

It was literally your job and your actions caused no harm.  Your coworkers are assholes though.  Both for calling you an asshole and preferring he bother the other residents."
bfk7jv,"NTA

>I should keep my opinions on what I find unattractive to myself

Then she shouldn't ask your opinion.  It's that simple. If she expects you to follow a script she needs to provide you your copy before the scene starts.

Although it's worth clarification: did she explicitly ask for your opinion or simply show you what she was looking at to show you?"
bfk8c0,"YTA. It's important to your son, but he's said he understands if it's too difficult for his father to come to the church. Follow his example and let it go. You wouldn't push your child to attend a church against his will, you shouldn't do it to your spouse either."
bfk96t,"NTA, they’re not doing their job and it’s affecting you so it’s fine if you report that to your superiors."
bfk9xo,"WBTA. It sounds like you were both busy. Holiday weekends with travel and family can be stressful. You said you are “brothers for life”. I assume that means understanding that people need space, time, boundaries and understanding. 

Maybe “asshole” is too strong a word but it seems odd to skip over giving someone the benefit of the doubt if they are as good/close a friend as you describe."
bfkauk,"NTA, they liked them, that's what matters."
bfkf12,NTA. What a couple of little monsters.
bfkgpe,NTA I’m sorry your mom took your money and thought it was ok to spend it at the bar instead of food for you guys   And you tried to do the right thing
bfkj81,NTA.  The old lady needs to be considerate with shared living spaces.
bfkp6p,"NTA
If your sister really had a problem with birthday parties in her beliefs, then she wouldn't have gone to another one. If she just didn't want to visit, she should have been up front about it, not lied and use religion as an excuse"
bfkpxq,"NTA, you didn’t want to go with him to prom so you said no. I’m sure it hurt him a bit that you didn’t say sorry or anything (not that it’s required), but you did what you did and there’s nothing you can really do about it now."
bfkpzo,Banned for criticizing mods
bfkv6b,"NTA

You have 17 years worth of reasons of not wanting him in your life.  You don't have to change your mind for any reason, ever."
bfkwtw,"YTA.

When it comes to gifts, it's the thought that counts. So let's count it out:

1. You bought the gift off an amazon ad;
2. You didn't check to see that the earrings were children's sized;
3. When the earrings arrived, you probably noticed they were tiny but didn't think twice about it;
4. You didn't get a card because you're not a card guy;
5. You didn't wrap the gift because you're not into wrapping; and
6. While money isn't everything, you literally spent a dollar per year of marriage on this gift.

Dude! Be honest. How much thought and effort did you put into this gift?  Because it sounds like the effort less than a minute of clicking on a suggested ad and clicking for 2 Day Shipping and the thought was ""good enough.""

You don't like card shopping? You don't want to spend a lot of money? You hate gift wrapping? Write a letter. A long, heartfelt letter, about what the last 10 years have meant to you. 

It doesn't have to be pretty or expensive. It's the thought that counts. And that's why your wife is wicked pissed."
bfkytx,"NTA. yes, he is gaslighting you. The ""you're racist for saying it's racist!"" Card is in fact something a lot of Diet Racists like to say to deflect any blame. Free speech has literally nothing to do with respecting each other in a relationship. 

Quite honestly the whole argument sounds fake so there's that too."
bfkzgn,"NTA. Mary obviously sucks and April is very immature. However, you don’t need to totally cut April off unless you want to, just be a bit more careful about how you hang out."
bfkznx,"NTA, your mom sounds old school is all. She’s not wrong, but she’s not right either."
bfkzs1,NTA but keep an eye on her. Her dementia may eventually cause her to eat something that does make her sick.
bfl6db,NAH - culty culty cult cult RUN.
bfl7ol,"YTA. Dude, smoke in your car or something. Or at least somewhere where nobody will have to smell it. Smoking inside is so inconsiderate of everyone around you."
bfl953,"NTA, with a pen she could easily smoke outside"
bfl9v6,"Eh, I’ll err on the side of NTA. She essentially signed a contract in which her neutering the puppy was one of the main clauses of her gaining ownership. I’m sure the breeder would take fault with that. I’d suggest do what you think is best."
bflau4,"YTA - Drivers I believe pay for their own gas and get paid little on the assumption they will make tips. Would you stiff a server at a restaurant because your bill was high? (If you answered yes, YTA for that too.)"
bflbv7,"NTA, there's literally nothing about weed that prevents you from hearing about seizures. I'd be super into hearing a first hand account of it, and even if I wasn't, I would probably just space out and be fine. Your friend is bad at weed."
bflgpt,"ESH, and I use that VERY loosely because she’s an obvious asshole. The only reason I say ESH is because you should have just confronted her. 

But you should have ran for the hills once she blamed her psychotic jealousy on trust issues. That’s not an excuse to act like that. 

I’m glad to hear you’re leaving her. She can’t be in a healthy relationship the way she is. Hopefully she gets better."
bfli25,NTA. That’s extremely unprofessional. She doesn’t even really know you.. it’s kind of creepy to pop in unannounced.
bfljjs,"YTA - you clearly have some sort of underlying issue if you felt the need to self-medicate with codeine several times a week, think that it takes approximately five drinks to relax, and now are planning to sneak around and smoke a couple of joints even after the issue has caused you and your wife to not speak for a day and a half. Based on your description of yourself and her past experience with her brother, I totally get why she is against it. You are being selfish. If you are that stressed out maybe you should re-examine your life to pinpoint the source of the stress and then take steps to mitigate it in a manner that is not destructive to your marriage. (I.e. therapy, taking up a new hobby, exercising, etc. )"
bfllth,"NTA - they sound very entitled. “But my baby’s first easter”. You stick to your guns, girl."
bflofq,"NAH, let her try it out and let the world be the executioner on this one."
bfloyg,NTA:  They should notify you if your schedule changes.
bflpub,"NTA - the family sounds like a much better home. Ultimately it comes down to what's good for the cat. Speaking from experience moving and changing owners is traumatic for cats and Cat A shouldn't have to go through that.

Also, as the primary caretaker of the cats you really should have the final word on it. Your roommate couldn't be bothered to feed them so why should he decide their fates?"
bflsn9,"NAH I mean... She does only want the best for you, for her, that's religion. She thinks she is helping you.
On the other side, you have every right to choose your beliefs. But, the mature way to go about it, isn't waking up one day and refusing to go. You should talk with your mother and explain your side of things. Try to make her understand how you feel.
Anyway, I don't think there are any assholes here."
bfltq6,"NTA.  If he needed a gate code, he could have contacted the storage unit office to confirm his rental agreement and get the code.  Maybe he has one, but maybe he doesn't.  Not worth the doesn't option."
bflx3u,NTA he can't take possession of it whilst you are paying rent. If he wants early access to decorate then he has to end your lease. He can't have his cake and eat it.
bflxic,"NTA, that's the point of these type of surveys as it allows people to say what they truly think without putting their own heads on the chopping block. If it's as bad as you say, you probably weren't the only one who spoke about him on the survey."
bflzue,NTA if I am honest it sounds like your girlfriend is making you a smaller priority from the other things she wants to do when she visits. This may be a red flag for your relationship.
bfm1xi,"NTA

If you didn't hear the door, then you didn't hear it.  Your dad is overreacting BUT I have learned that older parents tend to dig in more if they feel they are right, instead of just letting small things go. Apologize to your grandparents but explain you didn't hear the bell rang and let it go. Believe it or not, you have to be the mature one the older your parents get."
bfm4ar,"NTA it’s not your job to refund him. He entered a contract with the hotel (not you) and it cannot be broken without the money being lost anyway. I am sure if the hotel would give refunds then he would have gotten one. It’s not your fault he changed his mind, you owe him nothing yourself."
bfm68w,NTA. That’s what close friends are for. You help B through this and let X’s close friends help her through it.
bfm81l,NTA
bfm9xs,"NTA in the slightest. Well done you for speaking up and not losing your temper. 

It's good that your mum didn't get angry back but just be aware that sometimes the deflated/poor-me thing can be a bit of an act (ie if anger doesn't get them what they want, they'll switch to guilt) - chances are if they still don't get what they want, they'll switch back to anger again. 

My mum was like this. Might still be but we don't talk much anymore (I wasn't as calm as you when I laid it all out). To my parents credit I've had to ask for help since (very reluctantly) and they've given it... For me, being 'in their debt' is something I've always tried to avoid but I'm working on accepting it as their way of showing love (whilst not letting it become a tool they can use to control me).

Btw, check out r/raisedbynarcissists if you haven't already"
bfmcki,[deleted]
bfmd69,"YTA.
""Maybe she will get over the abuse if I violate her trust in me""
Therapy is good and important but she isn't a dog who has to be forced into taking medicine. It really takes time to adjust to medicine and getting mentally ready."
bfmdex,"NTA but you need to tell them how you feel about it if you plan on not going if you’ve already said you would. You’re not obligated to go, especially if their beliefs don’t align with yours and you’re an adult."
bfmdjb,"NTA. That’s crossing a line, and if he lied about it that’s even worse. I’d make it clear that that is the reason why though or else you’ll have another “nice guy” running around thinking you rejected him because of finding out his feelings."
bfmiyr,"NTA. You don’t owe him anything, especially after being an absentee parent for such a long time."
bfmizv,NTA. It is none of your faults that john isn't self aware of his own actions.
bfmj3b,"NTA. I would be careful confronting her as it may affect your grade. 

This might be an issue for the parents to confront the administration about because she sounds extremely unprofessional."
bfmn7w,"If your mental illness is so severe that it is interfering with daily life functions, then you need to be seeking appropriate treatment.  Otherwise, YTA for neglecting yourself.

If you aren’t that mentally ill, YTA for not going to your aunt’s birthday party.  Half of life is just showing up, even when you don’t feel like it."
bfmn96,"NTA- this is a tough one BUT you were super clear about what you wanted and your mum is going against that. It’s your wedding day. You and your partner should have exactly what you want.

However, your mum has put a lot of thought into making a wedding you would like. She is going to be hurt by your decision."
bfmqcs,"NTA

That's some bullshit they were pulling. $5 is a lot to pay, *especially* for a toilet that isn't clean and doesn't work!"
bfmrwz,"NTA. Not just for your mom’s sake, but for that of the entire family. I get wanting to protect and take care of your children but you have to let them learn from their mistakes and it seems like bailing your sister out would only lead to more problems."
bfmt6b,"NTA Definitely

Also this could fit in Maliciouse Compliance!!"
bfmuax,"NTA.  Just take all your stuff out of the kitchen and move it in your room. Use it, wash it and then back to your room. Trust me, they will not change.  No need to stress yourself on this."
bfmue3,"NTA. 

All they got was a telling off? I probably would've cancelled the whole damn party and have held a smaller party with just family (after all, your sister did nothing wrong in this case)."
bfmw1n,"NTA. It is indeed true that you can't always count on your mother to fix your problems, especially when it comes to stuff you should be able to do yourself. Your mother has good intentions, but she needs to understand that, and stop blaming you for it."
bfn0vb,"NAH... No ones unhappy here, it just didn’t turn out perfectly."
bfn19b,"NTA

> She wanted to do a share custody thing

It's a dog, not a child.   If you give in on this, she's going to find other reasons to stay in your life and you'll never get rid of her."
bfn4qy,"NTA. Also she’s a bit of an idiot. If you’d filled the form out wrong, she might not have been eligible for whatever the form was for. She should have at the very least stuck around and ideally, have had somebody help her with the form before she arrived there."
bfn6sq,"Why not suggest some meals you’d love for her to cook? Even cook together? NAH. She wants to do something nice, you want to eat healthily. I feel this can be resolved."
bfn7xb,[deleted]
bfnfxg,Nah homie you just unobservant
bfnkqx,"NTA - your dad seems chill and you've rearranged with him, so that's fine. You have your reasons for having to cancel on people and I am sure that they understand that. You're definitely not an AH, and the people that matter in this situation (ie you and your father) know this."
bfnl2c,"NTA, at all. Your dad sounds like a Dick and you have no obligation to go near him, let alone meet him. Just be careful with your mom, She might be kind of emotional at the moment. (Not saying you should meet for her sake btw)
 NVM just read your comment: your mom sounds like a Dick too, sorry to say it."
bfnp74,Why didn't you tell your wife but did tell the entire universe instead? Like you told ten people but not your wife.. sorry if unrelated just weird
bfnrck,NTA something like this happened with me and my sister. My solution was to create a second private story with just her added on it. I then post some of the stuff on there as well as on my normal private. This means that I can choose which posts I want her to see without her feeling left out that she isn't on my private.
bfns4a,"YTA if you don't give him a chance, NTA if he comes back and gives you an excuse to kick him"
bfnt7s,"~~INFO: why is your sister angry that she's getting the rest of your punchcard in free classes? Is it more that she's angry that you're not joining her anymore at the dance studio? Have you sought therapy or other assistance for your anxiety disorder?~~

NTA. You are taking steps to deal with your anxiety, and it sounds like it's quite severe. It's unfortunate that it's wrapped up in one of your main hobbies, but you're doing everything you can right now. I'm not a psychologist but it seems it would be counterproductive to go back while you still feel this anxious about it.

Edit 1: one more Q  
Edit 2: judgement rendered"
bfnvm0,"ESH

Just stop trying to have these discussions with him. If you start a conversation, then yes, you're the asshole for dropping it, but you are not the asshole if you stop having those conversations at all or decline to engage if he starts one."
bfnvrw,"NTA, find a new job. It won't get better."
bfnwho,"NTA! Why would you give her money in the first place? You owe her nothing after years of abusing you. Just cut off all connections with her, you have no point in staying in contact with your abusive mom."
bfnx6z,"NTA because well, Emma is verbal & emotional abusive to the point she almost hit you in Iceland - Nah, fuck her; that was smart of you to get out of there when did because who knows what would've happen if she struck you...."
bfo2xn,"YTA. It's not your body and it's not your choice. What he chooses to do is his business and to dissuade him from literally saving someone's life is a dick move. The hospital will almost certainly evaluate him for the things you're concerned about and ensure that he is mentally and physically able to handle this organ donation. 

If you desperately needed a kidney, would you appreciate someone convincing possibly your only hope at one from donating? Reverse the roles, see how you'd feel."
bfo3l0,"I kinda feel like if your sisters helped, itd probably a thing your family has done for each other and you should therefore help out even if it's a little bit. You couldn't have done it without your siblings help and it seems like a nice thing to for your family.

Ultimately its your money and NAH."
bfo6zb,"NTA. You all used the oil tank, it’s only fair that you all replace it at the end of the lease (regardless of who is staying or who is leaving)."
bfo9gm,"NTA. His jokes are childish. You specifically asked him not to continue the jokes, and he did. He needs to grow up."
bfo9lf,"ESH. “Fling” isn’t the proper term here. You are obviously underplaying **years** of experience you to have together. That said, you made clear what you wanted from the start. She agreed on the outside, but clearly not on the inside. You (and her) *knew* this after the first incident, but were okay continuing after she cried about it. Literally ESH lol. Ya’ll need distance."
bfofu1,"NTA. Your mother seems like an entitled pos. Don't bring your son for two main reasons:

1. Your mother will be a very, very bad influence to him.
2. It's your son, so you decide what's best for him."
bfokir,"NTA

You live there, so does he. He broke the rules it's as simple as that. Talk to your RA or whomever is in charge, a hefty fine may get them to change their ways."
bfolba,"""We order and my SO is already visibly annoyed because he thinks I could’ve chosen a healthier option"" I knew then your SO is an asshole



NTA"
bfon1q,"I'm Autistic too, and here's my POV:

**YTA.** mainly, for using autism as a scape goat for your problems and dislike for people.

You can't expect your parents to be unhappy because you are. Life goes on. If you don't like them, move out. I don't live with my parents, and they still try their hardest to support me. But you mentioned that you live with them, and they pay you to do so. If you don't appreciate that now, life only gets harder the older you get. Adapting to the world is something that we all have to do, Autistic or not. Those rules of society aren't that bad or hard. You'll have to support yourself one day, might as well adapt when you can. While you have their support as they're alive."
bfopul,NTA. Just don’t ruin the ending!
bfostr,"NAH this is a complicated situation. You can’t just open your wallet unconditionally, but you also can’t (from what you’ve said) see your sister become homeless or destitute.

I would suggest that you need to sit down with your sister and ask her for full disclosure on her financial issues. If she needs & wants your help, she should be willing to do this. It might be an issue of pride/privacy whatever, but she can’t just expect unconditional hand outs, no matter how much you love her, or how much you ‘owe’ her for bringing you up & her previous sacrifices. Though of course that appears to play a part in all of this.

If you sit down together to work out the best way to get her back on her feet. 

For e.g it might be that for a few years you find somewhere bigger that she helps you pay for, so you can all live together. She could then help with rent/mortgage, bills, childcare & the burden on you and her is less. Or perhaps you have a large garden that she could put a caravan/tiny house type temporary building & live there for less for a while to pay off debts etc.

There will be a solution that works for both of you, if she’s willing for full disclosure & compromise, but that can’t be you just keep bailing her out, as that’s not a long term viable solution."
bfowdx,"NTA - If your mother wanted to surprise you, she should have also made sure you weren't doing anything else. Then texting you that you should 'do whatever she asks without question' definitely makes her the asshole. Then also likely shit talked you to your sister who now thinks you're the bad guy too."
bfoy7y,NAH.  Bail out with your Aunt and enjoy the day away from the rest of them.  You'll regret the time you missed together if you don't.
bfoyrm,"You are totally not the asshole. I have depression as well, I’m seeing a therapist and I’m on medication and for the first time in years I feel normal. Mental illness is not an excuse for people being assholes. It simply isn’t. Also, drag shows have breaks so that the queens can go smoke, simple fact. I say don’t sweat it, her actions are on her."
bfp30b,"NTA - It was an accident, accidents happen. On top of that you got the keys back so IDK what her problem is."
bfp3m2,"NTA. Now's the time that you tell the maid of honor straight up that he is not allowed at the wedding. This is YOUR wedding, and if you don't want a shitty guest there that COULD cause a scene for shits and giggles, you have that right."
bfp3x4,"NTA - Ryan is a twat and isn't your friend, you don't owe him shit. Your friend is stupid for saying you should have let him copy because it was the ""nice"" thing to do."
bfp5a7,"YTA, you sound paranoid and are reading into things unnecessarily. Move on. 

Also if you have not had a discussion about exclusivity, you have no right to be mad if she _was_ with someone else."
bfpeif,"NTA  I feel like that's a lot of story missing here, but it would probably be too long to type out.  I'm going with NTA because the fight between you and Jim was between you and Jim.  You apologized, Jim accepted your apology.  Situation over.  The fact that Gary is using that fight to ghost you is not okay.  It feels like there is something else going on, but if Gary doesn't tell you, then you don't really know."
bfpjb6,"NTA. And it's your relationship, you don't have to justify it to anybody. With you being such a dog lover, and him apparently not a dog lover at all, this relationship seems kind of mismatched anyway. In the long run, I think you'll find it's for the best and you should never be guilted into a relationship. It should be mutual and enthusiastic, not a powerplay. Good luck! And have fun with your puppies!"
bfpk8z,"NAH.

Tell her that you would like to keep it private. She doesn't know how hard it was to talk about, or how you would like to keep it private, since it might not be as serious to her.

If you tell her, and she keeps going that's another thing."
bfpl50,"NTA. She's a racist, homophobic asshole, according to what you've said. And even if she weren't, you still wouldn't be absolutely obligated to do anything for her on Mother's Day."
bfpl6o,"NTA. Call him at your leisure, when you want to talk to him, and leave it at that. If he calls you out for not calling him, you take a deep breath and you shout... ""I LEARNED IT FROM YOU, OKAY! I LEARNED IT BY WATCHING YOU!""

...Okay, maybe not that, but you can't be expected to initiate all the phone calls."
bfpl8u,"No, NTA.  You've potentially saved somebody's life. 

God knows why your parents don't want you donating."
bfpljd,"NTA.

You don't have to accept any of his bullshit. As long as he's actually being a dick you shouldn't worry about what they think. 

But just make sure you aren't actually being the controlling one, and not cutting him some slack, he's only 10 after all."
bfpqav,NTA. Fuck that guy and his happiness. Your friend is also being a bit of an asshole by putting this guy’s feelings before those of an innocent 16yr old. Tell her before he ruins her life.
bfpqbl,"YTA because they are not your kids. Do what you want with yours (I actually agree with you) but it’s not up to you how and what to teach other kids. If a curse slips out, explain the adult thing and apologise, if only because it causes much less aggravation."
bfprpa,"NTA - The person who puts the money in shoulders the risk of losing it, so they also get to keep the winnings.  Your bro should be happy they are throwing some of it his way."
bfpurl,YTA If your parents are paying your way through school and also supporting you financially. It’s a slap in the face to them. True love will wait if you truly feel this guy you met is the one.
bfpv5d,"ESH. I think that you should be able to do what you love. Why is she so against motorbikes? It seems like fun. I can’t think of any reason why she wouldn’t want you to do that, as long as you had the finances. It comes across as controller. 

However, you shouldn’t have gone behind her back to do that. You should’ve been up front about it, or at least had a conversation about it. 

I think you need to talk to her about it."
bfpwa1,[deleted]
bfpxfg,NTA. They invited you. You said no. That’s ok. You don’t have to justify saying no to a lunch.
bfpyww,Nta it's very possible she might have OCD and shame on s for calling people with the disorder freaks.
bfq0vr,NTA.  You are allowed to feel as you do.  I am glad that you have Joe in your life.  Someone taught you to have character and standards.  It doesn't sound like it was your mom.
bfq2dk,"YTA if you go to your parents house while they're home at any time for any reason and don't at least pop in for a hello. Your mother asked you to come in for '30 seconds,' and yes, it might be longer than that, but it's your mother and it's Easter and you're going to her house. You say hello."
bfq4nf,"YTA

You would be the asshole. You go to support your boyfriend. He needs you there with him."
bfq6ox,"NTA they don’t respect you or your home. And if they can’t use pot responsibly they shouldn’t be smoking. They knew what time they had to leave, they should have paced themselves so they’re be sober to drive home. Chalk it up to being irresponsible and don’t invite them over to smoke again if they can’t respect your house."
bfq9p2,"YTA. 

It’s normal to see your friends car, get excited and call them. Her conclusion that your wife was awake was valid. While your wife may not trust the car and sleep in late, it’s still entirely possible she woke up early on a holiday to run to Walmart. Just as you did.  Also, as far as her “tattling” on you...you’re an adult dude. You can drive what you want.  You could’ve jus laughed the situation off. There was no need to be aggressive."
bfq9pr,"NTA  Just because someone is genetically related to you doesn't mean you have to like them, love them, or forgive them for being assholes.  Your aunt sounds like an entitled asshole who has a codependent relationship with her parents.  Stay away, OP, stay far, far away and thank the family gods that she's your aunt and not your mother."
bfqccc,It’s not pissy to want your sister at your wedding.
bfqd9q,"NTA. Bet you the rest of your family wishes they'd had the courage to say the same thing.

Maybe you could host a family get together and not invite the caustic couple?"
bfqiag,"NTA.  I understand why your friend had to reschedule for Sunday, but according to your post, he committed to being there at noon.  He made the commitment, he should have been there instead of stringing you along on Sunday."

bfqjzf,"NTA. You tried to set a time and she said whenever, then took 2 hours getting ready and blamed you for giving up easy. Bullet dodged"
bfqkb3,"NTA, you have a child and your GF is feeling left out because you're doing something for your child's team? She just sounds insecure.

Can your GF come to the games?"
bfqlj3,NAH. Round the clock elder care is hard and frankly I think should be left to professionals if you can afford it.
bfqoje,"NTA - It's your life and you can do whatever you want over easter. I can understand that your mom might be upset if she'd asked in advance, and then you cancelled on her, but she chose to assume you'd be coming without consulting you, and is now holding that against you. 

It's fine for parents to want to spend time with their kids, no matter the age, and she was probably looking forward to seeing you at Easter, but that doesn't excuse how petty she is being over it."

Your father may be upset, but at the end of the day, you are an adult and able to make your own decisions. Your name is what YOU have to live with for the rest of your life."
bfqpp8,"I'm gonna say something weird and say ESH. It seems like you guys are so focused on who's getting the credit for what gift instead of focusing on how to appreciate your mom and making the day special for her. If you guys are fighting, I don't think that'll make your mom happy for her special day."
bfqrwu,"NAH.  You haven't done anything wrong, but you're current SO is understandably upset. Look, isn't there a more appropriate person he can vent to? You've moved past that point in your life and I suggest you keep it that way."
bfqvwc,"NAH.  It sounds like he's trying to maintain his friendship with you, but being married and doing things with/for his wife is more important to him.

bfqybo,"YTA yes of course.

It doesn't matter what you *mean* if what you say is something completely different. Try in the future to think of different ways to say stuff. I've rewritten this comment a few times already because it wasn't quite what I want to get across."
bfqyxq,NTA.  You're hormonal. Congrats on the pregnancy and continue to be a good mom to both kiddos.
bfqzfx,"NTA. You didn't tear the family apart, your mom did. It is your right to cut off toxic people, regardless of how they are related to you."
bfr02x,YTA if you go on a match-making website and flirt with people with no intention to actually date. All you're doing is inviting people to waste their time.
bfr21j,"NTA. You gave him chances to contact you positively and he didn’t take it, keep doing what you are doing.

bfr4g4,"NTA. I totally get his culture of taking care of his family, but he cannot afford it. He should only be giving money he has as extra after bills are paid."
bfr6qj,"YTA. If you're on the phone go outside. Super obnoxious to do that when someone is watching TV or doing homework. What do you expect her to do, carry the TV outside?"
bfr7u5,"NTA. He's being a sore loser because he didn't want to fully lose to someone he thought was bad at the game. Have you explained to him that it hurt your feelings because you don't win very often, so it meant a lot to actually see the win screen? I can understand his ""logic"", but I think he was just salty."
bfr9cg,NTA. You seem more responsible than both your mother and your brother. The fact that your mother doesn't care about the poor Guinea pigs is astounding.
bfrak6,"NTA. She was asked multiple times. I would say, she contributes to vet costs for being irresponsible, and you need a new roommate that respects your pets and home. She sounds lazy, rude and self centered."
bfrapp,"NTA. I would suggest that you send him a text/email/whatever telling him that you do not want to currently have any relationship with him, and that he is not to contact you until you decide you want to re-open that door. Make it clear and concise, and don't go into a giant explanation about why - that will just invite him to argue with you and you don't need that."
bfrclm,NTA. She's a shitty mother.
bfrewu,"NTA.  Using or blocking access to someone’s property just because they aren’t there is bullshit, especially if it’s done regularly."
bfrfci,"NAH, but if you're fine with it, then why are you lying. Have you ever seen a doctor for this?"
bfrghu,NAH - You both have a different view of when pockets should be checked and thought the other person followed that view.

bfrkbw,"YTA. 

What is “what it means to be a man” supposed to even mean. You’re putting a lot of blame on your father for your own shitty life choices. Look up toxic masculinity if you think you have to be loud and domineering to be seen as manly."
bfrlx8,"NTA I felt so sorry for you while reading this.

I hope you can find something to calm you down or talk to someone other than your parents.

I don‘t think or don‘t hope that your dad was being an active ass but he should know by now that those things are important for you and when a situation like this escalates step back and help you calm down.

I can imagine it being frustrating to have to change place but hell, its like 10 seconds of inconvenience for him."
bfrrdm,"NTA. You already do 6-8hrs every day, it’s unfair to ask more of you.

Good luck with AP tests btw, coming up soon."
bfryr1,"NTA - My gf has spoken about the exact same thing to me, it is rude on my behalf to be pre occupied while speaking to her. If she makes the time to speak to me; I should do the same for her! 

Didn’t really think about it until she mentioned it, I didn’t have an issue with it and I’d hope your other half would be the same. 😊"
bfs0hc,NTA at all. As you said if she wants to have this big thing she can rent a hall or something. Don’t even bother offering your parents’ place.
bfs0x8,"NTA. I agree with your decision; I think your niece needs some tough love at this point. You've given her plenty of time to get it together, and she hasn't yet. Also, you get to set the rules for your home, and if she doesn't abide by them, you can definitely show her the door."
bfs2ob,NTA. Your Aunt sucks.
bfs3hq,YTA - For still dating him
bfs4vn,"Has he done anything wrong besides be in college at 27? You don't know what circumstances may have lead to him still being there. He could have not had the money to do it at a younger age.

YTA because you sound judgmental as fuck. Tell us more about how successful you are, you amazing 22 year old."
bfs9yu,"YTA because if it doesn't bother her, why does it bother you? As a person with tits, in my experience, you will ALWAYS get hit on. No matter how many people you block, 50 more come back. You've said she isn't flirting back and is clear that she's in a relationship, so it sounds like an insecurity that you guys could talk out."
bfsam5,NTA - not nearly enough time given to request everyone bring a dish. Everything else is irrelevant.
bfsbww,"YTA.  It's a service dog, not a regular pet.  The dog is essentially equivalent to her eyes.  You've only been dating her for a couple of months, why are you already planning on ditching HER EYES for the honeymoon?  You're dating her and she comes with the dog.  It's not negotiable."
bfsgzq,ESH use your words to communicate that they should wait instead of just automatically giving a low rating/not tipping.

bfspuc,"NAH it’s your parents money if they are nice enough to pay for school you should realize how fortunate you are to have it available, but it shouldn’t be used as leverage to force a belief onto you.

bft1qp,">But it still doesn't avoid the fact that her tic is a real big turn off for me. Especially during when we have sex, it doesn't look pretty to see your girlfriend's eyes spasming while you're looking down at her. In fact, the tic is really affecting the way I see her. I see her tic as detracting from her beauty, even though I really don't want it to. It's gotten so bad to the point where I kind of resent her, which is why I want a break up.

bftkj0,YTA. He spent a lot of time talking and then he was done.  Learn how to accept some personal time and space every now and then.

bfusrp,"NAH 
I understand your concern and resentment, but he has made a choice to forgive and move forward. Now, if there was more such as an inappropriate relationship, then that would be understandable.

Okay, ESH. You suck for not handling that better—not for your sake or his sake, but for your girlfriend’s sake. I know what it’s like to have your parents angry with your partner. It’s hell.

That said I do understand the reaction and he is such an asshole for doing that to you. No one should ever do that to anyone."
bfvhjl,"YTA, this post reeks of entitlement. They owe you nothing giftwise especially at 16yrs old. And I'm amazed at your mother's patience. 1 Walmart trip for parts is forgivable, mistakes happen, but 3 in a day makes her a saint for putting up with your awful planning."
bfvlk5,"YTA, yes she was reckless and endangered you but you went out of your way to ensure she got in trouble for it.

If the dog seems to be too aggressive towards your father then it may not be the best idea to bring him/her over. It seems like your Dad's opinion is not important at all when it seems that since he is the one being barked and threatened by the dog, his opinion should be held above others.

I don't get why the Dad's ideas are left out unless he's never said anything about it. My family has 3 dogs and one that passed away just over a year ago constantly barked at my Dad but never bit. We had him for 7 years and he always barked. We tried constantly to keep him from barking but he kept going. It seems that since the dog is actually aggressive and tried to bite your Dad then it might be best to leave him at home so that if he does bite your Dad something crazy doesn't happen and the dog ends up put down.

Make sure to get your Dad's opinion over all else, though"

bfvub7,"NAH.  DVM here  I'm very sorry for this whole situation.  Bone cancer sucks and it almost certainly HAS spread, even if it's not visible on Xrays yet, especially since it was bad enough to cause a fracture.

You are NOT an asshole for wanting the best for her, but the best thing might have been to put her down.  Even with chemo, you might have bought her nine months, and losing a front leg is harder on a dog than losing a back leg.  

You might want to fold a bath towel into a sling and put it under her chest to help her walk.  I would focus on her quality of life.  Be sure she has adequate pain medication, whatever she wants to eat, anything to make her comfortable.  And if an emergency DOES occur, you might want to have her put down then.  Find out now whether your vet will come to your home to do it, whether there is a house call vet who could come, and what your options are if she needs to be put down in the middle of the night.

I'm so very sorry."

I'm sorry that you have to put up with this insane situation, but you've been handling it fantastically.  You aren't in the wrong for not inviting this woman to your graduation, especially when she didn't even ask.  Your sister sounds toxic as hell too.

I know this isn't an advice subreddit, but the best thing you can do is go to university and succeed so you can get the hell out of there.

If you're at Thanksgiving dinner and your cousin mentions that she's a virgin and you say ""But I saw you fucking some white trash guy on the hood of a pickup truck last week"", you might be entirely correct but that's still a dogshit thing to bring up in front of her parents. 

You can believe that most snakes are completely harmless and be totally right, but if someone asks you not to talk about snakes or bring your pet snake around them because they have a phobia *you would still be the asshole for doing those things*. 

And if a trans person says ""hey, the language you use towards me makes me uncomfortable, would you please modify it slightly""...""But I use it towards everyone"" might be CORRECT but the NICE thing to do would be to make the bare minimum effort to make someone comfortable instead of dying on the hill of saying ""dude""."

Being overweight in Highschool is tough. maybe when she is older, things may be different, but when you are growing, weight is often times going to be wonky. You are asking HER to sacrifice, when you refuse to do the same.

Furthermore, how do you think the director would look if he all of the sudden recast the best singer because she has a weight issue. not only is that cruel, but that could get him in big trouble. 

He also gave you the option to be a background dancer, which according to you is a more complex dance routine anyways, which would fix your official complaint, although I would be willing to bet your real issue is you probably don't want to be seen with her, because you have been offered a solution to your ""problem"" already.

She says it's temporary and something she would enjoy doing. If money isn't a concern, then there shouldn't be a problem which her taking the kind of job she wants.

Not exactly sure this belongs in this sub. Asking for a judgement, I know what I have to do.

Throwaway account.

To get things started, we are not exactly kids anymore: 26 (her) & 23yo (male, me).

So, I have chronic depression since I'm something like 14 or 15. My mental health is not really balanced, as I can have 2 months being just fine and get down for 6 months from one day to another.

For the past few years, she has been my shield, she did everything she could to bring me up whenever my health fell down. I owe her my life, literally. I owe her absolutely everything actually, and I even felt invulnerable for some time.

As she was my only real support, life made its thing and I fell in love with her. That's important for the rest of the story. I did tell her already, and she just said ""not for now, I prefer to be by myself for the time being"". Hope was still a thing.

We casually discussed about it some days ago, as we regularly do. But this time was different: ""I don't feel something like this for you. I mean, at least, not now.""

I know there is not a lot of difference - but English is not our main language, and the way she did say it meant quite a lot in our language. It's basically ""welp, maybe in some years, but don't count on it."" Then, she went on with the possibility that she finds someone, one day.

I know it's her life, and I have to accept it. I do, I think.

But it was enough to drag me down once more.

She does feel bad for me loving her, she feels like she's responsible for it, especially as she know it drains me, despite me never telling her how bad it does.

Anyway, today her Grandpa had to be hospitalized for a serious problem. She is really close to her whole family, so it did affect her really badly.

She is broken and I can't help her as I am struggling myself, as I have been for literally years while she was doing everything she could for me.

So, AITA?

Tell your teammate to consider the opposite of this situation. You are already talking to the client, and the client asks you a question about the project. Do you refuse to answer her question and ask her to wait and ask the entire team later? No, that's ridiculous, and in a real-world environment that client would wonder why they're paying you to be an obstinate noncommunicator. It was a simple question that was asked because the opportunity arose and it was convenient. This is basic communication. As long as you relayed it to your teammates in a timely fashion, then they're just as equally apprised of the situation as you are.

If you sat on the information and didn't tell your teammates, that's getting to be asshole territory.

If this persists, most capstone projects have a faculty advisor. It's not worth pestering them now about it, but if this kind of behavior from your ""leader"" gets to the point where it might influence your grade (e.g. peer assessment), then you should let the advisor know. To be safe, it might be worth keeping a record of these kinds of communications."

Some of these places are not pleasant. Some are extremely *unpleasant*. To me, ""military-style boarding school"" sounds like code for ""we will break your delinquent child into compliance by any means necessary"". It only takes one problematic instructor, or one problematic roommate, for this to be *very bad experience with lasting repercussions*. Boarding schools can be terrible.

Your son doesn't sound like a degenerate, just like a sixteen year old kid. Sure, maybe he's not as disciplined as you are today, and maybe not even when you were sixteen yourself, but this would be an extremely dramatic action to take for ""a sixteen year old who likes to have a good time.""

Have you considered a much less dramatic action instead, such as requiring him to get a job instead of providing him with money (that is to say, he has to get a job, he has to keep it, his earnings go into his account and he has to manage his money)? Or perhaps requiring him to volunteer in order to earn his allowance? Some action that puts him in touch with lower-income people, or some experience that requires him to take slightly more responsibility? This sounds like you've gone from 0 to 100 overnight, for a kid who is mostly normal. 

>He couldn't do cheat days, occasionally eating some junk food

A couple of years ago would mean your son was 14! You are expecting adult behaviours from your teenage son. It's okay to want to teach him responsibility, but there are less dramatic ways to do it.

EDIT: You may also find that the school doesn't teach your son personal responsibility, but instead teaches him not to have any personal responsibility at all--to rely on others to provide structure and rules."

3) You didn't even have the decency to to break up face to face, nor did you have the decency to either do it fast or wait after the surgery to do it. 

Bruh. Is this a shitpost?"
bgfd93,"This one is difficult. I feel like the difference between not the asshole and asshole is how she would feel about it. If she thinks you're hitting on her, then YTA.

Honestly, I just wouldn't do it. She might have resting bitch face. She might not appreciate the attention, even if it's well intentioned. I understand where you're coming from; you just want to do a nice thing. But it's possible that she might take offense."
bgff5j,NTA - He's gatekeeping how people transition? wtf
bgfgqm,NAH.   As a 39 y/o male I appreciate that you would tell your friend your Dad isn't interested. Saves him from something super awkward.  Let the poor girl down gently

I’m confused. If you bought her a ticket to this concert and you’re not even going to the concert...why are you driving with her? Just have her go the 5 hours alone and let her spend time with her friend she never gets to see."
bgfkne,NTA. They were doing drugs in front of customers and you all could have gotten in trouble.

You are not a-holes for having the wedding you want. Your parents are not a-holes for being hurt. 

You may want to have a heart-to-heart about it."
bgfqr8,NTA - She sounds like an oxygen thief. You are under no obligation to have anything to do with her.
bgfyg8,"NTA. That woman sounds horrible. Is there a reason to even keep communicating with her? I get that she’s your neighbor, but I would mostly avoid her if she’s going to be a homophobic bigot who is upsetting a child. Your neighbors who defend her don’t sound all that great, either."
bgg2qe,"NTA, you were left out of the email chain, and were *barely* informed of just a shred of information at the last minute! What on earth were you supposed to do?"
bgg3nc,"ESH. Plan B can actually be a very unpleasant experience. Heavy periods, cramping, etc. She has every right to not want to take it. But y'all both fucked up in having unprotected sex."
bgg785,"YTA - You have some first world problems if don't feel well because you drank too much water and cant let a 70 year old woman have a seat on a bus. 

Nobody was talking shit about your family.....they were talking shit about you."
bggcvf,"YTA for the method in which you did this. Calling it out publicly on Facebook is inappropriate. She absolutely has her shame of blame in this situation, but as your father said it was not your place to say anything - at least not to the whole world. Saying something to her privately and/or to your father would have been much more reasonable."
bggdsu,NTA - 'so I’m sleeping on the floor' FUCK THAT. If my BF was ever okay with me sleeping on the floor to attend a family event I wouldn't be his BF for much long.
