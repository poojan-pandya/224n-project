bggiuw,"ESH. He’s an asshole for cheating, you’re an asshole for drinking and driving.  You said that flippantly but it can’t be overstated. DRINKING AND DRIVING IS FUCKING STUPID.

Poor Sarah."
bggs0s,"YTA.

You made plans and promised her to help, now you're changing plans and putting her in a bind. It would be different if you had something come up that wasn't based on some fun thing your trying to do. You're clearly more invested in going out with your friends drinking and partying, which translates to ""you're not that important to me"" to her, and she's right.

If that's your priority (friends, partying, drinking) that's OK, but then you're probably not ready for a relationship of any serious kind, and after 4 years she should be taking some priority in your life.  The fact she doesn't to me means you need to reevaluate if you should be together."
bggueo,"NTA. Welcome to marriage life. Use this as a training ground for fake interest. If you have kids, it will be needed much more."
bggxaf,"YTA

There’s a difference between looking and leering."
bgh3m9,"ESH. I had two really hard, really awful pregnancies. I never threw away food or called my husband a fucking imbecile.

But withdrawing support and affection from her in response to her bad behaviour is petty, and will cause long-term problems in your relationship. She will never, ever forget that you withdrew your support at the end of her first pregnancy, with twins.

Sit down with her and reiterate that her behaviour was hurtful and unacceptable. That there will be no more late-night snack runs after 10 pm (or whatever) and that she is responsible for making sure the house is well-stocked with the snacks that she likes. 

That you will not be cooking for her, as she insults your cooking, but that you are happy to order takeout for you to eat together. 

That she is not allowed to insult you, throw food away, or lose her shit and yell at you. Crying is fine. (She probably won't be able to control crying, but you can always control yelling). 

And that she is not allowed to wake you after 12 pm - she can go and get her own snacks from the well-stocked cupboard and refrigerator after midnight.

That you love her, but that doesn't excuse her treating you badly, and that you are hurt by this behaviour, and that its unnecessary; and more than that, that apologising afterwards *doesn't make up for doing it in the first place*.

DO NOT stop sleeping with her, or supporting her. You would be the biggest asshole on the planet if you did this in retaliation, or to punish her.

And while we're on the subject of sleeping, does she have a body pillow ? The ones that form a giant ""U"" shape are the best thing ever during late pregnancy. She might sleep better with one like that.

Does she have a doula organised ? It might help to get one organised now, so that she has someone to help her and calm her fears and help her with pregnancy issues. Having twins is really rough on your body, and its super helpful to have someone who knows what they're doing helping you with maternity belts and bras and pillows etc. This in turn may help her to feel calmer and less panicky."

You weren't egging her on to drink it down. You're not her mother. Any person there could have helped cut her off."
bgh5ff,"NTA You asked her to stop, it should have been clear to her at that point that this joke was hitting a nerve. Continuing and refusing to apologise beyond that point isn’t nice.

People default to “its a joke” often when they realise they have upset someone unintentionally and are embarrassed about it. She probably wasn’t being malicious, but no, I don’t think you’re in the wrong here."

bghhtg,"NTA. 

That’s entitled as hell and pretty bold of them to think that just because they don’t feel like waiting in line like everyone else, they can just skip it. I’m so glad you said something and I wish there were more people who would speak up in that way, because the sheer entitlement and self-absorption of people today is getting out of control. So thank you for speaking up!"
bghhvo,"NTA - SOOOO NTA. ur husband is being so unreasonable and petty. he was being kinda super gross about your intimate area in front of health care professionals, and calling him out wasn’t wrong to do

bghwvf,NTA. You are very much allowed to not enjoy the company of drunk people.
bghynv,"ESH - the shopkeeper was an asshole.  He determined that it was more profitable to cut the two customers hair than to cut only your hair in the time allotted, violating his own stated rule that first come, first serve.  It was unadulterated greed.

Allowing the argument to escalate to the point where someone had to threaten to involve law enforcement meant that you went too far in your defense.  Being refused a haircut under these circumstances is not enough to allow for this level of escalation."

He gets a job thanks to you and wants to be paid for getting it."
bgi60p,"NTA. 

You are cutting yourself off from a toxic source in your life, a person that will do you nothing but harm if you decide to keep up with them. 

They are wasting your time, resources, and energy by constantly nagging you and mentioning sex every time you talk. 

You also need to distance totals from those who support him, because they aren't doing anything to support you either."

It's perfectly reasonable not to want strangers at your wedding. Presumably, you invited her and her husband by name, and did not give her a random plus one."
bgid52,"I'm going to go with ESH. Your sister still did knowingly get with an engaged guy. Even though the guy lied about it, her best friend did tell her that he was engaged.

bgixnn,"YTA (barely).

You can choose not to be friends with other people for whatever reason you want (which would change this to NAH), but asking if you can demand/dictate if they both can and can’t attend events or show up together is  not your place.

Just don’t be friends with people if you don’t want to be, but don’t try to control their lives just to “maintain a friendship”.

Just walk away."
bgixqz,"NTA - they never bothered asking you for permission to use your account, so you don't have to bother with niceties. These people are grown ass adults, and if they can afford ass cream, they can afford an amazon account."
bgiz9b,NTA. Tell the school yourself you don't want to be listed as an EC.
bgizht,"NAH, but you need to not put the responsibility of your need for validation on others. Validation is going to come from within to be perfectly honest. At the beginning of this, you described those two people as acquaintances-turned-friends, but you seem to crave their friendship at a deeper level than you led on, which is, idk, giving me pause? I'm having a hard time discerning what you really want from this friendship, and whether it should come from those people, or if you should self reflect and get whatever you need from within."
bgj07n,"NAH- She can ask and you can say no.   


BUT have you considered the ways that she has supported you in getting this degree? Is it worth hurting her feelings because you don't want to wear a hat?"
bgj50b,NAH. Discuss it like adults. You have serious issues and I don't think it's fair for you to pay rent when no one else is either. You might as well pay your own mortgage at that point.
bgj66v,"> I told her “Yeah that’s fine” without inflection or joy in my voice. I immediately regretted it because I probably could have replied in a friendlier tone.

Do you have some insane issues with self-esteem and/or social anxiety?"
bgj6oc,"NAH for not remembering them. 

I do think in future though you should try to remember them a bit. Maybe try to remember something they tell you about themselves to help jog your memory. Like, “oh that’s the IT nerd” or “that person went to Bali”. 

You can use it to your advantage by asking them about it in future and they’ll never know that you don’t even know their name. They’ll think you’ve been paying attention to them all along.

You’ll easily end up knowing everyone that way, and no feelings will be hurt in future. :)

Edit: typos"
bgj70h,"NTA of course. 

You are entitled to your beliefs. 


That being said, at 17 your life will be easier if you go with the flow for now.  Don’t fight going to church etc and don’t make a big deal out of things. 

Once you are able to get yourself financially independent you will get to decide what kind (if any) relationship you have with the assholes that you have for parents. 


As an aside, don’t put yourself down by calling yourself an “NPC” and other such things.   Be kinder to yourself than that"
bgj9wl,"ESH. Your heart was in the right place. I probably would have just said ""I'm sorry, I don't have the funds right now."" Instead of bombarding her with information (to which I entirely agree with you). She also could have taken your concern genuinely instead of instantly going on the defense.

But I'm also a very non confrontational person, so I could be wrong.

bgjbdi,"NTA - If they don't approve of your partner, then in my opinion they don't deserve an invitation to the wedding. Certainly if you're not even close to them and your dad isn't going to be extremely angry. NTA, don't invite them. Hope you have a great wedding!!"
bgjbmg,"Nta

What’s a grown woman doing throwing bowls lol

Is it maybe that when you’re up you do stuff for her? Now she’s doing it and doesn’t want to? It seems like such an ott reaction. 

Maybe sleep in til 9-10 and then get ready earlier to keep her happy? My mum had this weird thing about getting up after noon. I could get up at 11:45, all was well, but 12:10 and shit went down. Parents are weird. If you’re studying, looking after ur bro and helping around the house then she is TA, especially for her temper tantrum."
bgjd25,YTA. You went on a cruise and didn't watch your kids at all and then wanted them to get lost so you could get cozy with someone else. The kids were obviously upset but you cared more about this guy then their feelings.
bgjfru,"YTA. Honestly it more or less sounds like you want to do it just because she told you no. Classic ""telling me no only makes me want it more"" situation. YTA"
bgjhne,"ESH, but I'm leaning towards YTA due to severity

Question. Are you paying for your schooling, housing, groceries, etc.? 


You're having a tough time, and your mother is doing a horrible job at understanding that. If you are paying for all of your things, then tell her to stop pestering you, and you'll do it on your own time.

If she's paying, you need to straighten the fuck up. You go to school out of state. In the off chance that you are getting an in-state rate, you're still spending an enormous amount of your parent's money, and you're acting as if signing another lease for several more months of living space, on top of the extra fees for not taking a full course load, is nothing.

You seem to be too focused on whatever is upsetting you, and I really do hope that improves. But you're acting silly about everything else. You fucked you. You failed the classes (that I'm assuming you didn't pay for) . Now you think you should still go on the vacation? And even better, you think the vacation should take precedence over you taking the courses needed to graduate BECAUSE you failed them the first time?"
bgjozn,"NTA. It's your life and she doesn't get to dictate how you live it and it really does sound like your husband is more supportive than she is/has been.

That being said it sounds like she's teetering on the edge of not wanting to associate with you anymore so calling her out may put her over the edge. If you don't care about that then go ahead by all means and call her out, no one can blame you."
bgjqji,"NTA

your letter was concise but not condescending

you gathered up the trash and put it in a bag, rather than just piling it up on their porch (which I guarantee a lot of people would do!)

honestly I feel like you handled this the best possible way, so don't feel bad"
bgk2mb,">**I took a snap of her and sent it to her** and said ""you like single dads, huh?""

&#x200B;

That's fucking creepy.

>We got in a fight over it and her defense is that the guy was her cousin's husband and she was just hanging out with them, but there was no way for me to know that.

&#x200B;

YTA- it doesn't matter if you knew or not. You handled this situation terribly. You're seriously debating whether or not to apologize? You really are an asshole."
bgk4ag,"NTA - The girlfriend is hiding this because she knows it reflects badly on her, not because she thinks its such a minor thing. Tell the boyfriend."

This is the only one that I think was kind of uncool."
bgkbro,"Thankfully, I hardly ever work with him. But if he does it again, I’m going to flat out refuse to work with him. I’m leaving at the end of the summer anyway. I don’t really care about the job.

bgkjl2,"NTA at all, although you might want to double check with your cousin that your getting the whole story. Your family could be giving them a hard time too and you just don't hear that part. Or maybe your beautiful wedding changed their mind about how nice Mexico actually is.

Ultimately, they are hypocritical, and it's your choice to allow toxic hypocrites in your life, just make sure you get the whole story before jumping to conclusions."
bgkmdx,"NAH. You're really overthinking this. You made a reasonable request, she agreed end of story."
bgkmrv,"NTA - dude, she's crazy. Block her on every possible means and run like hell. There's no commitment after a single meet up. 

If she's going that cray cray, imagine if you dated her and broke it off later. Eesh."
bgknpw,"YTA

You're fine in not wanting to be friends with the dude or hang out or whatever - but don't just ghost the dude.  That's an asshole move (Yes, he was an asshole by just kind of inviting himself over - but don't ghost people, my guy)"
bgko5r,"NTA at all, if he’s making you uncomfortable you can definitely tell him, but you don’t owe him anything."
bgkokw,NTA. Your friend is a bridezilla and needs to get a grip. Trying to control your hair? Negative. Absolutely not. Nope. No. Just no.
bgkor2,"NTA- Quite literally throwing rocks when he lives in a glass house.

&#x200B;

That's a life lesson. Not your fault he was unaware."
bgksc9,"NAH. I think you know you weren’t the asshole. You had a bad day, you asked him to get off your PS4. He didn’t ask. You didn’t do anything wrong, and although maybe he should’ve asked, maybe he was under the impression you’ve let him in the past, so it would be okay."
bgkt4f,NTA. Fuck your friend.
bgku11,"NAH - although I'm leaning toward her as an asshole since she is being kind of rude.

I'm voting NAH, because it sounds like you haven't directly spoken to her about this yet and given her a chance to change her behavior.

I would suggest take a moment and think about what's really bothering you the most about the situation (in simple words) and what you would like to change, and talk to her about that.  Talk to her calmly, be polite and respectful, don't come at it like you are spoiling for an argument.

A good starting point is something like, ""When you do X, I feel Y.  I would like things to be different Z"".

E.g., ""When I let you stay over at my house and you leave a mess for me to clean up, I feel frustrated and like you're taking my generosity for granted. I'd appreciate it if you would start doing (whatever it is that is reasonable and you think would help).""

Or maybe your issue is more that you feel like she doesn't spend time with you when she comes over, so maybe that's something to talk about.

You could also experiment with just telling her ""no"" when she asks to ~~come~~ stay over, too. ""We can hang out if you'd like, but I'd really rather you not stay over tonight.""

Edit: Changed some wording

Edit2: My ""NAH"" is also giving her the benefit of the doubt that she doesn't realize she is taking you for granted.  If she is purposefully using you, then yeah, NTA (and she is)."
bgkwcq,"No big deal. That's why I'm not confronting them about it or making it into a thing; they didn't do anything wrong. I'm just a little sensitive, so I'm choosing not to actively try to hang out with them. Does that make me an asshole?"
bgkxv9,"YTA. She is, in the eyes of the law, essentially equal to a parent. The two of them are a package deal. You are allowed to not like it. You are allowed to leave. You are not allowed to put your gf in the absolutely shitty position of having to make a choice between you and the entire human being whose life she is responsible for."
bgkzne,"YTA.

> She didn't care about my beliefs at all 

It doesn't matter what your beliefs regarding abortion are - it's your friend's body. You have no right to dictate what she can do with that."
bgl1kh,"NTA- she made a mess of the fridge, so it's only fair she cleans it."
bgl2bg,"YTA for sleeping with someone and kicking her out.  If you take someone home for sex, assume they may want to stay over.  If you needed to get to sleep, you shouldn't have taken someone home with you.  She wasn't so random when you wanted to put your dick in her."
bgl7uc,NTA you tipped more than enough. And most of the time it’s added up over the end of the night and they take the cash tip out of all the cash they receive and often have to make change anyway. It’s to be expected and most people pay with credit card. I doubt she’d be upset to get a good tip and cash out as usual. Your friend probably hasn’t been a server and didn’t realize everyone is making change and usually has $2-$5 of change on them for every shift as it is. The change goes back into your change bag.
bgl82m,NTA. I wouldn't want them at my graduation either.
bgl9ip,"ESH. I feel for you, the scattering of your fathers ashes is an event you should definitely get to be there for, and it is a bit selfish for your mother to tell you you can’t be there, but you reacted extremely immaturely and instead of talking about it, you got aggressive.  Perhaps if you had talked to her instead of shouting at her, you might have gotten across the point that you should be there because it’s your father. This is a stressful time for both of you, and both of you could have done much better to not make this about yourselves."
bgla16,"NAH. As long as you're not a dick about it, there's no harm in asking."
bglc83,"NAH - you obviously didn’t have any ill-intentions, but given how many dickheads are out there, I can understand why she’d react the way she did. (EDIT: I mean it’s obvious *to us* that your intentions were cool, but it probably wouldn’t have been to her)"
bgldvb,"NAH

giving her a 3 months heads up to move out is totally fine and will give her plenty of time to look for anew place. Just because SHE thought she can wait till winter does not mean that YOU have too.

From what you describe it seems tome that she sn't really aware of how much the situation stresses you out and has probably never lived by herself before. Hence I am not saying NTA. Should I be wrong and she is just taking advantage of you being nice to her, this would bee an NTA instead of an NAH"
bglfzc,"NAH. Honesty and communication in a situation like this is vital. You have an uneasy feeling about a sperm donor, and your wife doesn't seem to be forcing you into it or making the decision without your consent. 

What you need to do is both sit down and have an in depth and real talk about this and what it could mean in the future for both of you. I wish you the best OP!"
bglkac,"YTA - this is 100% your fault. You cheated on him for 6 years, he owes you nothing. Every day when 6 asks why he can’t go to dads house that is your fault."
bglmdj,"NTA bye bye Jack, time to start adulting !"
bglooa,"YTA - you apologized to her because you wanted to feel better and wanted her to forgive you. Even at 40, your interactions are still all about you. She was the victim, you were the asshole, and instead of just sincerely saying ""sorry"" and leaving it at that, you told her ""it would mean a lot if she forgave \[you\]."" You deserved exactly what you got, and dude, I know you were young, and we all do regrettable things, but you were 17 - more than old enough to know that what you were doing was Earth-shatteringly bad for that girl. You ***should*** feel bad about having done this, and she is well within her rights never to absolve you of your guilt. Leave the girl alone, and quit reopening those ugly old wounds. You should probably never really feel comfortable when you think back on this, not because you're obligated to wear a hair shirt or feel miserable for the rest of your life (you deserve overall happiness as much as any other human) but because that uncomfortableness and guilt is a reminder to think about the consequences of your actions."

If my friend was in a stupid relationship that I knew wasn't going to end well, then I would probably say something to him because I don't want to see my friends get crushed. I'd hope my friends would do the same for me. However, it's important not to be demanding by making it seem like your giving him an order. Just be like, ""hey, so as you're friend I just want to say that I think you're taking a huge risk being with this girl because of X, Y and Z. You can do what you want, but my honest advice to you is that you should cut ties with her. I'm just trying to look out for you bud, don't take this the wrong way. You can make your own decision, this is just my two cents from an outsider's perspective"". Hopefully he'll be smart and take your advice."

It's very likely that if you bring another roommate into this situation to replace her, you will be in for a very nasty surprise.  Two days on this sub will tell you all you need to know about bad roommates, and how common they are.  There will always be issues with roommates, and these issues are WAY at the mild end of the spectrum, and I believe you feel the way you do because you do not have the breadth of experience necessary to make a better decision.  Your experience with roommates up to this point has been much, much better than the average, which skews your perspective."

This is a perfectly reasonable compromise. He can drink like that, but you don't want to be a part of it. That should be a wakeup to him that something is wrong.

If she is unwilling, try to gauge why. Be wary that she might try to manipulate you into paying more. It is easy to rationalize “she’s my mom” or “they’re my family, I should help”, but at the end of the day: do what is financially healthy for you.

bgrzoi,"NTA

If things are indeed the way you describe them, then your parents are clearly abusive towards you. They treat you in an absolutely horrible manner and don't seem to care about you at all.

Unfortunately, given your age, you are not yet in position to completely ignore your parents; you are still legally dependent on them. In addition, finding a job at this point will have a serious impact on your education. And make no mistake; acquiring solid educational foundations is your only shot at going away to a college and subsequently becoming independent, thusly escaping your parents' grasp.

Therefore, my advice to you would be to stay as strong as humanly possible. You are already doing a great job by undertaking all the abuse. Try to keep it up while you're still in school. It's going to be really hard, but you should try your best to not allow your parents' behaviour to affect and/or traumatise you. Maintain your mental and psychological stability; try to let your anger and frustration out by doing things you enjoy, preferably things where your parents can't affect you. Talk to your close friends or even partners about your situation and rely on their help to manage your feelings. Try to pull through as best as you can, until you can stand your own ground. And above all, do not neglect your education; it may very well be your only saving grace.

As a final note, bear in mind that, should things ever get too abusive and dangerous towards you, you can always ask for external help. For example, going to a psychologist in secret can really help you deal with the situation. And if the situation goes to extremes, you should always remember that the law is 100% on your side; it's much better to contact your local police office or DA, than to endure excessive abuse. Do not be afraid to take any necessary measures to ensure your mental, psychological and physical well-being. Just make sure not to go as far as to cause harm to your parents; violence is never the answer to violence, and you will only end up hurting yourself in the end."

Just stay with me here. The things you complained about are your perception of how she feels, it's pretty normal for people to express even fake remorse at our troubles. If you don't enjoy the fake sympathy, just tell her. Be like ""hey thx for your concern but it's not a big deal""

Passive-aggressive games poison relationships, because you both know something is wrong yet no one will step up and claim ownership over it. It's just not worth starting bad blood over, at least not yet"

EDIT after thinking on it some more and seeing it from the boss's side:

He was being a boss. You can't just let employees show up late again and again otherwise they'll start taking advantage. He was perfectly within his rights to tell you to be on time or find another job, which you did anyway.

You were very petty and quit without notice though. It's not your boss's fault you have poor timekeeping and took his warning literally instead of facing the consequences at work, which would likely be some form of disciplinary and not a firing. You don't sound like the best employee."

You should tread carefully in how you give her advice. You're probably right in assessing this online relationship, it isn't a stable rock for her to stand on after what she went through. But compared to what she went through, this is the best relationship she has had in years. And she's right

So she doesn't really know any better, and to her you are taking a small dump on her happiness. The best way to navigate this is to encourage her into therapy before embarking on another serious relationship. Once she is in therapy, let her make her own decisions and understand that your role as her friend is to just be a rock of stability. Sometimes being a good friend is knowing when to give advice, and when to hold back"

Personally I feel it would be more respectful for you to take a moment during the day or at sunset (as the line says ""at the going down of the sun""), when you are actually fully awake and thinking about it, rather than to go to the ceremony when you are not able to be mentally present.

It sounds like your mother will understand. As for the distant family member, although there is more emphasis on that these days, remember ANZAC day was to honour all the war dead, not just people we have a personal connection to. At Gallipoli we honour the Turkish dead as well."

Mental illness is something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. And it can affect the people around you as well. When she lashes out against you, it makes you feel sad and upset just like she is. That’s not a stable environment for a relationship to thrive. I strongly encourage her to work with a therapist or see a psychiatrist because she’s only causing more pain and hurt to herself, not to mention the people around her. 

I have GAD and PTSD from previous sexual assaults. I did some of the same things she did to my boyfriend as well. Eventually he confronted me about it and said I need to make a change. So I took online therapy and it was amazing. I actually just stopped my sessions less than a week ago because both he and I agreed that I was in a place that was so much better from where I started. 

Sometimes you have to accept that you can’t be abusive to yourself and loving to someone else. Those two don’t fit together. To be in a relationship with someone else, a person must make sure that they are in a mindset and environment where they are able to handle the pressures and responsibility of a relationship. And mental illness can affect that. She doesn’t have to get better overnight but she can start the change."

Look, you have no idea why these people are eating in class. Maybe they have to run to work, or just got to class from work. Maybe they’re hypoglycemic or diabetic. You’re not the only person out there who has a medical issue and trying to make it so that you’re the only one being catered to in the class is short sighted at the least and entitled at the most. BUT, your classmates are guilty of this as well as they should at least be conscious of allergies and the like that might be set of by food and food smells. 

You deserve to be able to sit in class without the distraction and interruption of possibly being disturbed by your own illness. But those that need to eat for medical reasons or due to time constraints (ever tried concentrating when you’re starving? It sucks.) should be taken into consideration as well. 

The best solution would be to talk to your professor and classmates and find a solution that works for everyone. Maybe taking 10 minutes out of class to allow for a snack outside the room. Or separating those that bring food to one side of the class. Or even banning MEALS but not snack like items like protein bars, fruits, crackers, etc. 

There’s a way you can all coexist that doesn’t put you before them, or them before you. You all just need to be polite and work it out."

Yours is a difficult age. Sure, you see your parents all the time so you don't have much to discuss.

However, they feel you drifting away. They want to spend ""quality family time"" together, precisely because of that. They did all the logistics for a family vacation, and they want it to be a good memory, however bland it may seem to you. Yet their child chooses to stay in their room."
bgwigf,"NTA 

She sounds like a narcissist. You did her and your family a favor by moving in and helping her and them out, not to mention keeping the house afloat. She couldn’t even provide you with a place to sleep. Even Harry Potter got a cupboard under the stairs. You got a fucking floor. 

She will continue to bleed you dry in all aspects (monetarily, emotionally, mentally, physically) if you continue to let her. 

Move out ASAP. Take the WiFi and phone plan with you. She’s an adult, she needs to be responsible for her life and her minor children, not you."
bgwiyz,"~~I don't think you're necessarily an asshole but~~ (see edit)

this would be a red flag to me if I was a woman dating you. Men who specifically only want younger women and not women their own age often have other problems with how they approach dating and relationships. For example, control problems, unrealistic standards (even that 23yo is going to age eventually), creepy paternalistic attitudes towards gfs, etc. 

This would be a strong signal to me ""maybe this guy is creepy and toxic in dating."" Doesn't mean that's TRUE.  It's just a potential that you bring to mind when you say this. I think that's probably what your friends are reacting to.

Edit to add - It comes across hypocritical and judgmental that you think 32 y.o. women have ""too much baggage"" but you don't, also.

Edit 2 - **Actually I changed my mind. I think YTA for that line and because I think you actually rule out women over 28 if you really are the [identical tinder poster from before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bdsipc/aita_for_having_my_tinder_range_set_to_2228_i_am/).** If yes, just accept you're acting in a creepy way and have an unhealthy attitude.

Just a little edit, I'm probably a guy like Chris. I bet my gf would get mad at me too for not putting in the effort. Seems like Chris doesn't want to go, so they should speak to eachother (Chris and Jen) and not get mad at you. Jen is probably just looking for something to get angry about since she can't talk it out with Chris or something like that lol."

bh34s9,"NTA, I've been my Dad's photo assistant on a number of freelance shoots of the year and what you were doing shouldn't have caused any harm to a normal functioning tripod. Your friend is being a jerk.

bh36lg,"INFO how old are you?

Edit: I see you are 19. YTA you can get your own food"
bh3777,NTA - Your dad is the TA for putting you in the middle if his divorce. He needs to respect that she is still your mom and not force you to take sides.
bh380z,"YTA for trying to switch back. You should've done your due diligence ahead of time, something along the lines of ""I really need the aisle seat, is yours also an aisle?"""
bh3apy,"YTA.

I don't blame you for wanting to go and see your friends.  But newsflash - this isn't about **you** (""why do I need always press pause"").  The fact that you don't want to be there for your wife when her father might die - makes you the asshole."
bh3aqw,"NTA, but I’ve been there and all you can do is adjust / plan ahead. Like saying you have to be there earlier than you really do. Getting upset won’t fix it, trust me.

bh3bm9,"NTA, tipping at those places was never the norm before those iPad POS things (I used to work in a similar kind of cafe). It was nice if someone tossed us their change or the like for a cup of coffee but it was never expected. My own thoughts on it is if there is a tip jar then 1-2 bucks at the time you pay is nice but there is not the 15-20% expectation that there would be in a normal restaurant."
bh3duo,NTA. You told them you couldn't work that day. What are they gonna do? Fire you?
bh3ecq,"YTA

But it really doesn't matter if you're the asshole or not.  If the estate owes a debt, they must be paid before the inheritors get their inheritance.  If you force the executor to take you to court, you'll get even less in the end if lawyers have to get involved.

You're just shooting yourself in the foot if you don't return the portion of the inheritance needed to pay the taxes.  Ask for proper documentation and fork over the portion you owe."
bh3fr6,"NTA. You owe him nothing. You weren't close then, and he straight up told you ""yeah campus police got called on me 'cause I upset a girl so much."" He was testing the waters to see if that'd scare you away or make you feel bad for him. 

Find a club or three to join if you wanna make friends, or talk to people in your classes. He's not your only option."
bh3gsb,ESH. Everyone sucks. I understand your frustration but she’s 9. You should try more efficient ways to help her with her bathroom habits rather than punish and blast her. Your mom/dad should have taught her this already and should go over it with her several times if they haven’t.

bh3kyh,"NTA. I think with some people, they don’t care about the consequences of their vote until it directly affects them. They’re perfectly happy to hurt others. Maybe she’ll learn something. But probably not. She’s gonna shit talk you all over Facebook, tho."

bh3uuv,"I’m going to say NAH

The people in your class just wanted to have more time to prepare. Nothing wrong with that.

The presentation date did not work for you, so you voted no. Also nothing wrong with that.

I don’t even think the professor was an asshole. The reason the vote had to be unanimous is because people plan around these things. Someone could have been greatly inconvenienced by the new date. Whereas everyone should have been planning for the first due date the entire time."
bh3vlc,"YTA. I'm actually allergic to high dosages of fiber (the nickel content, technically) and I'll get a rash. I know it's rare, but there may be other reasons why someone can't have too much fiber. Plus, you were doing it to be a vindictive asshole. I get it, trust me, but part of customer service is to just deal with it, unfortunately lol."
bh3wdv,"NTA, you have every right to be upset. But just think it out, these kinds of choices have the potential to created regret later in life"
bh3zn7,NTA. At all. I’m sorry your family hasn’t been more supportive. Please reach out and find someone that you can talk to.
bh41zp,"I'm gonna say YTA. You know this means a lot to your mother and you're picking a race over her. Yes, it has symbolic meaning to you, but there are other 5ks. Your mother is only graduating once.

bh45fn,"NTA. Some random strangers bodily fluids got all over you. You don’t know what the hell caused the kid to be sick. There is a specific reason the cleaning and disposal of bodily fluids is taken seriously and protective gear (gloves) as well as a cleaning agent to clump it up and then disinfectant is used on any area vomit has touched. Anyone saying You’re the asshole can shove it. You had vomit touching your bare skin. He wasn’t your kid, or a family members."

bh49m1,"YTA. Or your sister's the asshole if this really is her story. Sweet zombie baby Jesus, punishing the aunt for the dad's behaviour is not okay. Your aunt and cousin would be within their rights to stop speaking to your side of the family entirely if you're going to side with your asshole dad."
bh4eza,"NTA

You spelled out your constraints, budget, time off etc, but she clearly didn't consider your needs or offered to comprimise.

Sounds like you've dodged a bullet anyhow."
bh4fsb,"NAH. It's okay for her to feel disappointed that you didn't get a gift for a day that is really important to her, as she probably expected a gift like every other year. 

Remember that you're also hiding something from her. While this is a good surprise, people often think their boyfriend is being shady when they're about to propose and *that* might play in to why she is upset."

>he is 100% at fault for being a grown ass adult that opened a car door while it was in motion. His excuse for opening it was that he needed to get something from the house, yet did not verbally state that he was going to exit.

He broke your car. He should pay the deductible. End of story."
bh4ram,NTA health trumps all other concerns
bh4rob,"NTA. you’re doing the right thing. If she decides to remove you from her wedding, just know that that’s on her completely and is not your fault. It’s probably because you aren’t very close with one another (I’m not very close with my sister, who is also 7 years older and very different from me) but she should be able to put this aside so that you can still be a part of her special day (and hopefully still go to dinner for her party)!"
bh4vhy,"Ah, the folly of youth

NTA. School drama. It'll be forgotten"
bh4vo4,"NAH but

""We decided to go to Hawaii for our honeymoon in may so we could attend her best friends wedding.""

You did it to go to the wedding. There are other aspects of the wedding she wants to participate in. Y'all shouldve picked a different honeymoon"
bh4y80,"NTA she wanted you to notice she wasn’t talking as much, and she wanted you to worry. She’s being emotionally manipulative."
bh54ok,"NTA, sounds like he’s a little crazy. Thankfully you made it home in time!"
bh54x3,"NTA - he sounds needy and insecure, which is probably why he’s not finding women to date."
bh59yp,"NAH

It sounds like neither of you are mature enough for a romantic relationship at this point. Personally, I would keep the friendship going. You'll find that it gets harder to find and keep good friends the older you get.

Just don't get all jealous if she hooks up with someone else while away at college. If you can't tolerate that idea then you'll have to cut her out of your life."
bh5a59,"NTA you need to set some boundaries and offer to visit but no driving and running errands, take it or leave it. If your mom has means to buy a car she can get her own car."
bh5dl2,"NTA. 

Seems like your friend is overly sensitive, maybe a little needy."
bh5fym,"NTA. It's extremely rude and inconsiderate to bring sick kids and/or adults visiting to others. Most people literally cannot afford to be sick, others have compromised immune systems."
bh5gbh,"YTA

Just because you don't like the cut of their jib doesn't mean they should be treated like lepers.

I really hope you have no actual power over people if this is how you'd treat people you don't know."
bh5hzr,"NAH - I’m so sorry, OP. This sucks in every way. Your parents clearly care hugely about you, and want this to be as easy on you as possible (although none of this sounds easy). You clearly care about your family too, and want to be there for them. I don’t think you’d be in the wrong if you chose to do either. I’d decide what to do by forgetting everything that’s been said, and work out whether you’d be ok without attending your fathers funeral, and work from there. If you think you could say goodbye another way, then do it, but if you need the funeral for closure, then go."
bh5kfe,"NTA

He's out partying and spending money on random crap, while you literally keep the lights on for him.  Sounds like a moocher."
bh5p08,NAH - you don't have to use Facebook and none of your friends/family have complained about the situation.
bh5p9m,NTA- they should have definitely told you earlier especially if they were struggling the week before. Speaking from experience mental health issues don’t automatically excuse bad behaviour
bh5rz9,NTA- You have a right to live your own life and also im assuming you are going to get into a relationship some time in your life which means you will need some independence from your parents
bh5s28,NTA. They have to pay their part. Maybe this will serve you as a lesson not to put the charge on your card with people who don't pay everything back. Why did the waiter insist on having one bill tho? I thought you could ask for separate bills.
bh5wqa,"ESH - to me you all just sound like pretty shitty, manipulative people..."
bh5xn6,"NTA, you guys were impossible, move on bud"
bh67dv,"NTA - who does that? If you want something, you save up and get a proper job.

Edit: see below. YTA, OP."
bh67mj,"YTA.  It's hot out and she was wearing a tank top.  Who gives a fuck?  Only you.  She can go out in a bikini and it's not your place to tell her to cover up.  Being a woman doesn't mean it's acceptable for you to slut shame and degrade her.  If you're going to pull the woman card, one would think you'd be more sensitive to how gross this behavior is.

Biphobia is not acceptable.  Bisexual people can be perfectly monogamous.  Grow up."
bh6ddx,"NTA.  No one is entitled to touch your body or make you uncomfortable.  Even if someone is trying to be loving or blame being old, no one is entitled to touch you.  You're not a terrible daughter or granddaughter.  Your family is being terrible for not respecting your bodily autonomy."

bh6gjt,"YWBTA 

&#x200B;

It sounds like you made your opinion clear and he didn't agree with it.  I doubt returning it is a viable option and selling it now wouldn't fix whatever loss he is taking on the transaction.  Likely he might not be in a position to buy another cheaper car if he sells this one for much less than he paid for it.  

&#x200B;

This is one of those life situations where, yes he made a bad choice, and you were correct to advise and warn him upfront, but having another intervention isn't going to accomplish anything productive and will only damage your friendship.  He will learn this lesson the hard way, and hopefully you can sympathize while knowing he made the situation himself but holding back the urge to say ""I told you so"""
bh6ksj,"NTA if you think he didn’t do his job well or did it badly, give a bad review. You’re only an asshole if you write fake reviews"
bh6zm8,"NTA. But I definitely agree that they way you broke it to him was a shade cowardly, but then again when is a good time to let an old friend down? What matters is that you stood up for yourself and your bandmates and  of course you feel like an asshole because you’re human and you don’t want to disappoint close friends."
bh7355,"YTA-suck it up, life is full of doing things while you're sleep deprived.  Look at any parents, and you'll see your surrounded by walking zombies ready to pass out."
bh74am,"No, you wouldn’t be the asshole.  If asked then just say that it was booked out the day you wanted to go so you had to swap it for X experience instead but that you had a fabulous time."
bh773k,You wouldn’t be the asshole for talking to her about your feelings but you *absolutely would be the asshole* if you ignored her for a bit afterwards.  That shit is petty.  Grow up.
bh773n,[deleted]
bh7bff,"NAH, but it might be a good idea if you know in advance that someone is going to be staying over to either grind the beans the night before, or have a stash of already ground coffee for things like this. 

Ultimately, you pay the bills and they're a guest. It would be considerate of you to make as little noise as possible, but it's unfair of them to expect you to upend your routine because other roommate doesn't want a boy in their bedroom."
bh7il6,NTA. They are abusing your generosity
bh7j0i,NTA but I’d maybe be a bit more direct about it so you don’t have to hide from her.
bh7pd0,"YTA could’ve accomplished your supposed goal by just saying you two broke up, without getting into specifics.  I’m sure the mutual friend doesn’t want to be put in the middle of your relationship drama."
bh7r3c,"NTA. You’re being nothing but polite and considerate and on top of being a shitty host, your boyfriend’s Mom just obviously has a stick up her ass in general. If she was a respectful person she’d make sure she made some food you could eat so you wouldn’t have to bring your own. 

Your boyfriend needs to be a united front with you here, or you have some serious problems in your relationship. Frankly it’s his responsibility to run interference and sort this out with his family, and if they continue to disrespect you, then he should stop attending their events in solidarity with you. That’s what I’d do if you family was shitty to my partner."
bh7r4n,Have you thought that perhaps she may need your help/company driving BECAUSE the wedding is nine hours away?
bh7wq7,This post demonstrates why this sub is awful. These are the children commenting on most every post
bh7zno,"YTA. Like you said, she only wants what's best for you. Shes probably also worried about your future and general well being. By snapping at her you only reinforced her opinion that you need to be playing less video games."
bh842r,NTA- can you claim it on insurance or take it to a small claims court?

bh8iqz,NTA - If you won't be able to see your Dad for 2 years pick the time with your Dad. Maybe you could take your brother out to do something one on one.
bh8lt6,"NTA - They might not ""get"" why you're upset, but they can still be sympathetic.

What parasite do you think your snails have?"
bh8nvx,"NTA, I don't get why she couldn't just tell you over email, especially considering you made her aware of your situation"
bh8q4r,"Going against the grain here; YTA.

He's not entitled to a relationship; you're not interested, that's that. 

What everyone ITT doesn't mention is that by the exact same logic you're also not entitled to his friendship; he doesn't want to remain friends with you and you lashed out at him for it after what by your account was a relatively quiet cutting of ties from his end."
bh8qaj,NTA .  No no no no danger Will Robinson.  IMO there is a difference between hitting the withdrawal limit and not having the money.   My grandpa told me: never lend money you can't afford to lose.   You made the right call 100%.
bh8qd2,"NTA if you do the second option. But you really shouldn't destroy his HDD. If it were me, I'd copy the data on them, for future use. I'd be careful about what was on them before I copied them though. You don't want to be in possession of something that will get you hemmed up. Get yourself out of there. You love your mom so I'm guessing you'd make an effort to create a safety net for her once things finally fall apart and she gets away from him. Document everything because she's going to need it. Just don't do anything that would put you in a bind, your mom is gonna need you."
bh8rmw,"NTA, you shouldn't give out other people's phone numbers. The best response is along the lines of: ""well I can give her your number if you'd like."" Which would have left the ball in your bosses court."
bh8srm,"NAH, but maybe find out what she would like to do and chip away at this, and that if and only if it’s restricting the things you can do together in a way that’s actually causing your friendship trouble, or you’re just worried about her long-term happiness if she doesn’t grow up a bit more AND your friend says she is aware of the problem and wants to get more confident about these things.  Can’t expect anything big overnight.  And pick things that aren’t in anyway ethical issue (i.e. alcohol might continue to be an issue because your friend believes it’s wrong, rather than only her mum thinking that).  Does she still live with her mum? - would imagine so, and that it’s making it even harder...."
bh8stq,"YTA

If Ryan has never acted on those feelings or made you feel uncomfortable, then you're uninviting him for no reason.

It is one thing to have feelings for someone you can't have.  It is another thing entirely to act on them.

Haven't you ever developed feelings for one of your female friends who didn't feel the same way back?"
bh8v1u,"YTA, they gave their time while you were working to watch your child. If it's such a big deal, you now have plenty of time, due to being unable to work now, to go see them and bring your kid with you. It's kind of a slap in the face for the service they did for you. 

TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT"
bh8x5j,"NTA - you've asked them nicely, they haven't listened, so you escalated."
bh917k,NTA. Babysitting is a job. There’s no requirement to do any job.
bh95rp,"NTA - you deserve to be heard and the damage this did to you needs to be addressed. You don’t have to keep this to your self. Please tell your parents and set up some counseling.

Edit: I’d like to point out that him being a good person now doesn’t absolve him of the damage he’s done to you. Maybe he doesn’t deserve to deal with the fallout now but you absolutely shouldn’t have to carry the pain he inflicted with you forever."
bh98r6,"YTA. You say you think her expectations are fair so this is something you've agreed to. But you don't stick to it, and continue to upset her. I don't know how you keep 'accidentally' breaking the agreement? 

Personally I think the situation sounds unhealthy but you signed up to it so abide by it."
bh99bd,"NAH -  ON YOUR WEDDING INVITATIONS, NOTE THAT THE EXPECTED ATTIRE IS BUSINESS CASUAL."
bh99r1,"ESH

Yeah you should be more careful with these products when there are children around but everyone makes mistakes. There was no need for your husband to react like that."
bh9aie,NAH. It sounds like you're really concerned about your parents money management. Some ideas around money when you're in poverty. Can really hurt you when you're no longer in poverty. This sounds like a symptom of something else bothering you. I would graciously accept the gift if they offer again. Thank them. Wait a few days. And then sit them down and address your concerns about money. Leave the jewelry out of it. Point out everything else that you think is hurting them. And gently suggest they need to reevaluate their budget. And offer to help.
bh9axv,"Honestly your roommate is the asshole. If he let's someone sleep in your bed he could have at least asked and definitely changed the sheets and cleaned everything up and not just left it like that. Although thinking about that someone had Sex there cleaning isn't enough and a new bed sheet is a requirement.

Edit: NTA"
bh9bpr,"YTA. Whether or not it *actually* works is irrelevant.. Sometimes things make us feel better for reasons we cannot explain.

She is not causing harm to anyone."
bh9gkt,NAH - Why not keep it as a middle for them and change your first?
bh9jzp,"YTA, princess."

You: Because a good prank is a prank after which *everyone* can laugh. A good prank doesn’t harm anyone or trigger intense negative emotions. What you you did has made this man fear for his family and life — and that over a longer course of time. You should absolutely be ashamed and learn from your mistake. 

Him: Because of how he overreacted. I understand how upset he must have been, but punching a wall and lashing out at his wife like that was *too* much. He’s not an asshole for being upset, but he’s an asshole for being borderline abusive in this situation."
bha8xa,"NAH

I would say while you understand his family is very close knit would it be possible if he spent time at their house instead of yours all of the time?  It sounds like you would go to your parent's house all of the time but not the other way around.  When we see my in laws we visit them at their house or a restaurant and the same for my parents.  No one comes to our house as it's the agreed upon safe zone for both me and my wife (aka our house always has a billion toys around it). and we don't always want to pretend it's not like two tornadoes are living there."
bhac1g,"NTA. You're not obligated to see ""New popular movie"" (are we not allowed to just say Endgame?) with anyone you don't want to. If your friend asks, your line is ""Oh, you already knew the ending so I figured you'd seen it without me or just didn't want to see it."""
bhagjz,">I then told her to stay out of my work life and that she didn't need to have anything to do with it.

YTA- if that is how you talk to your wife, she really does deserve better level of communication. 

You drink in your office.  With your secretary.  Are there any rules in your company?  

>this secretary is probably wearing what people would consider to be excessively tight and revealing clothing and is naturally flirtatious.

No dress code?  No rules against drinking in the office? 

The scenario your wife walked into would bother/trouble almost any reasonable person.  Your rude and condescending **dismissal** of her concerns sucks dude."
bhagxr,You made your mother cry and you couldn’t care less.  That’s pretty douchey

I wouldn't want to take people like your ""friends"" either. Take who you want and have a good time."
bhavky,"NAH. As a vegetarian, I try to be clear to other people preparing my food about what I do and don’t eat, but sometimes there are miscommunications. Realizing that something I’ve been eating actually goes against my personal choices sucks, so yeah, I imagine that friend is having some feelings about it. But that doesn’t necessarily make it your fault, so long as you weren’t deliberately trying to conceal anything from him (or deliberately trying to upset him)."

bhb7sd,"This is ridiculous. NTA. They're doing your brother a HUGE disservice by not teaching him how to manage his disorder or to take responsibility for himself. Letting him get away with all of this (and literally wiping his ass, which is a completely different level of disgusting) is just going to tank him in the real world. It would be a great idea for your parents to seek counseling, for him and for themselves. I get that it can be overwhelming to raise a child with a problem like this, but they can learn how to cope with it while also helping to prepare him for adulthood."

Get into therapy to work on your insecurity and lack of self esteem. 

And never stiff a waiter over your imagined insults. 

Also, instead of sitting there like two sacks of wet leaves, after a minute or two passed, why didn't you just go ask someone where to sit/if you needed to wait.  being proactive and advocating for yourself is never a bad thing if done politely."

bhc6y4,"NTA. The right answer is what you already suggested - don't be in the party if she doesn't want your tattoos in all the pictures. I don't know how more reasonable you can be than back out.  Wearing a coverup sounds awful and not fun, and you're not ashamed of your tattoos.

I don't get why it's so important for you to be there, but not actual you, just the non-tattooed version of you she wants. It's weird."

You wife clearly has concerns or insecurities about how your family treats her, and you dismissed it without even discussing it with your family."

Those people sound awful."
bhcez5,"NTA- Take him to the vet, see if he is chipped.  If he is not chipped, and has no identification tags, the ""owner"" probably has no legal proof of ownership. 

In theory he could try to take you to court- if he has the money and interest.  But you should tell the vet the full story, and ask the vet to certify the cat a stray, and facilitate an adoption with full paperwork in your name, and microchip."
bhcgda,"ESH 

You are both immature, inconsiderate little weasels. He's a rat for expecting you to just move out.  You are a vindictive snake for jerking him around for petty, 2nd grade ""revenge"". 

Oh, you are both so impossibly dumb for not having a lease. lease's protect the renter **more** than the landlord."
bhcjnj,"NTA- you have been **BEYOND** accommodating thus far.  

The dog goes, or Joe goes, it is that simple.  Stick to your guns."
bhcm0h,"NTA. If it was his scheduled time to have the kids, it was his responsibility to find someone to watch them while he took care of whatever it was that he needed to."
bhcp4e,"NTA, because I get the argument, but you sure as shit will look like one in their eyes. You are personally singling out their kids going ""Yeah, you did a shit job raising them""."
bhcr8q,"NTA. He probably felt like there was an implied ""if I could I would"", so he's getting upset over something you didn't say; he thought it so loudly he thought you felt the same."
bhcu5t,"NTA: You definitely don't appear to be doing anything wrong here, at all. It's obvious your MIL is manipulative, and taking advantage of her hierarchy stance by constantly running to your parents to complain.

Posting in relationship advice would probably be a good idea, so they can provide insight on how to deal with this until the middle of June... Good luck."
bhcw0i,"NAH- Monica is not anyone’s property, and Chandler definitely had plenty of time to try and make a move. He chose not to. If you and Monica get along well and you see things progressing past hookups, I would suggest being straight with Chandler and just taking it as it comes. Keep in mind, he is probably going to overreact and he may end the friendship. But you aren’t the asshole, no."
bhcw2k,I think call you an asshole is harsh but there are instructions for just about anything online. Even if they are not super specific it shouldn’t be that hard to figure out. Like when you made plain oatmeal you took a bite realized it wasn’t good now you know to add shit to it.
bhcwla,"NTA. Fuck racists.

**If the races were reversed, people would be applauding you.**"
bhcwvu,"NAH, at 17 it’s normal to want to be independent. She is your mom though and you will always be her kid! She just wants to feel included in your life, and it can be a lot. Just talk to her and tell her how you feel, don’t let it build up or you might blow up and say things that you will regret when you get older."
bhczov,Idk if asshole is the right word but you’re (unfortunately) in the wrong here. CPS wouldn’t do a thing beyond making sure she’s being fed and has a safe place to live. You can’t force a diagnosis or services.
bhd04g,"NTA but this behavior should have been relayed to the professor LONG before the final project was due. In all my classes, they would have removed her from your group and made her do the entire project herself."
bhd1ar,"NAH

Seems legit. You can ask the theater if you're not sure whether that's okay. Just follow what they tell you. If they say the ticket is for admission, period, and that you can't save seats, abide by that."
bhd7wu,Nah -  but I think you can both get over it
bhd9c2,NTA.  It's *your* name.  It's easier for your legal name to match the name you use.
bhdavn,"NTA. Your mind was in the right place - what if something WAS wrong with the other guest? You would have been the hero. You were just double checking and being extra cautious, and if the manager was grumpy about it afterwards that’s their problem, not yours."
bhdje1,"YTA, she handled this appropriately and you massively overreacted.

And although it isn't germane to the question at hand whether or not Jordan Peterson is trash (he is) it **is** relevant if I tell you that part of the problem here is that you've staked out a contentious position and so you need to be mindful that most of the people you talk to about it are not going to want to hear it. If you send someone a cute cat video that's 30 seconds long they are likely to watch it relatively quickly, if you send someone a half hour interview with a pseudointellectual misogynist they are not going to be in a huge hurry to block out some time for it. 

As a general rule the longer and more unpleasant the thing you send someone the more time you should give them to review it."
bhdk6l,"YTA: Morally speaking, yeah. I understand, because I've been there.

Honestly, have you tried just talking to the professor? I've found teachers are REALLY accommodating if you talk to them... If you tell your professor how much you're studying, but you're still really struggling with the subject, then they'll be more than happy to help you."
bhdk7v,"YTA: This could have been such a good learning experience for the class, and for the student. You could have asked her instead to elaborate and write a paragraph on maybe how she feels about that... Instead, you asked her to basically pretend she was born in the USA and could do it. That's pretty offensive, and I could see why she would be upset."

bhdnls,"ESH. This is a pretty clear-cut case. Your ex is a terrible person who is acting despicably, but you crossed a line in sending that to her family. They did nothing to deserve being dragged into this situation.

Edit: Also, as u/wzlywzly points out, OP is pretty clearly wronging the guy in the video. His ex deserves what's coming to her (though OP's an asshole for involving her friends and family), but that firmly cements it as ESH.

Edit 2: So the guy in the video is the same one who's spreading rumors, which means that he's an asshole too. Everybody's an asshole! Though OP's ex is still the biggest asshole by far."

bhdv87,">He says that he shouldn't have to pay child support once he has a stable job for a child that he never wanted. However, even when I suggested adoption, he told me that he did not want some random person raising his child.

What we have here is a dude who doesn't know who he is or what he wants. You want to have this baby, you're gonna have to be prepared to do it without him because he's obviously not going to be reliable.

PS- that's...not how child support works. He should look into that.

You split the cooking and you respect her food choices so she should respect yours. (Wholegrain pasta might be healthier but it definitely doesn't taste as good).

bheqop,"YTA for not setting the record straight about your friend to your other friend. Opinions of people matter and you have no idea if they would ever meet.  


Sidenote: I find the idea that you mentioned 'Rachel' in this entirely irrelevant and feel you need to really think about why you're letting this external 'close friend' talk shit about your other friend and big up the idea of you being with this girl."

Instead of telling him that he can’t use your car, which doesn’t seem to be the main issue, why don’t you just tell him that your feelings are hurt because he didn’t give you attention when he came home? It seems to me like there are several points where you could communicate with him about how you’re feeling, but instead you don’t, and just tell him to figure his own way out with fixing his car."
bhew43,"Yo, dude, format. But about the content, NAH, you seem a bit childish about it but in the end you're allowed to choose your friends and them having shitty taste in other people and not regarding your feelings is as good a reason as any to quit being their friend.

bhf8uh,"NTA, you paid a fair amount and if she wanted it to be a 'share everything' deal then she should have said so upfront so you knew (and could have said you wanted the shrimp to yourself if necessary)."
bhf9gy,"YTA. A living room is for living in, and that's generally where the TV goes in a home. If you are upset that you can't use the TV as much as you would like to, that's something that you should discuss with them so that you can reach an agreement about you getting more TV time. But you can't outright tell them to move the TV to the bedroom, that's ridiculous. The living room is a shared space."
bhfb9m,NTA. Do companies give us 2 weeks notice before we are terminated? Jobs should be treated as more disposable than people. Working in an industry where there is high demand for semi-competent people I have almost never given notice when I left.

Don’t say shit behind someone’s back — especially to their friend — if you don’t want that someone, and others, finding out. 

Glad you at least feel bad about it. 

Also, as a side note, check out some actual feminist literature, because there’s a hell of a lot you could learn."
bhfjl1,"ESH, they shouldn’t be so flaky and you shouldn’t be using your dead mother to win an argument, that’s just tacky."
bhflfp,ESH. You suck for essentially kicking her out. She sucks for putting you in that situation and taking the biggest room in the first place
bhfls9,"NTA. It's completely fair to not support what you believe is an unhealthy relationship, ESPECIALLY if it began when she was still with your dad. 

Though, if you've made peace with your mom, you should make sure your mom knows you support her, just not this marriage. Otherwise, she might believe you just don't want anything to do with her. Is it possible for you and your little brother to have a sit-down talk with her to explain where you're coming from, and why you think her relationship isn't healthy for her or you?"
bhfml9,"NAH.

Something of a Machiavellian approach.  You're for defs a Slytherin, but this doesn't amount to asshole behavior if this is really true in your school:

> 99.999% of high schoolers, myself included, obviously support rights for LGBT people

In my kids' high school (rural America), this is not the case, and plenty of people would have made the case you made out of genuine homophobia."
bhfpve,"NAH, because “white” isn’t a culture, which you do not seem to be aware of. Estonian? Absolutely. Celebrate the fuck out of that, it’s who you and your ancestors are. But things like “white”, “black” etc are socially constructed and imposed categories which in reality don’t mean much. They don’t tell you who you are or where you come from."

bhfuos,NTA it's their fault for not doing the project. You don't owe them they're work.

Edit: changed to NAH based on clarification."
bhg1e9,"YTA for not being upfront with this friend about your boundaries. I think it would have been beneficial for you to have a discussion with him about some of these issues you have, and let him know that it makes you uncomfortable when he vents to you.

bhg1t4,"YTA

There is nothing wrong with giving kids an incentive to do thier best but to say they will lose 200 dollars for a B and 300 dollars for a C is fucked up. What if they do thier absolute best, get a B or a C and are essentially punished for it? It doesn't make sense at all. You will put unnecessary pressure on them."

bhga59,"I'm going against everyone else and saying NAH. 

This might sound odd, but i think she should've communicated with you. While it's her body, half of your interest in her is how she looks, so it'd be nice of her to say, ""hey, look, i think i want to do this."". Now, it's her body, so she's under *no obligation* to not go through with it if you don't like it, but it opens a door to communication to stop things like this, but she definitely doesn't have to do what you like. 

However, you could have given her a chance to respond also. If you don't like her red hair or nose piercing, I think you should've told her a little more gently and/or before you broke up with her so she had a chance to respond. However, you're also under no obligation to date someone who you no longer are attracted to.

Rough situation :c"
bhgale,"NTA, if she complains, remind her that she ghosted you."
bhgaws,"NAH. I’m the new family in my family. I’m the one who got the Disneyland dad while my half siblings got the military alcoholic. It’s hard. And I can’t speak for your dads other kids, but I want you to know that they probably aren’t dummies and realize this discrepancy, too. I sure did. That knowledge and guilt is something I will always carry with me. But my siblings and I have learned to be open about it, and reconcile these feelings to the point where we have an alright relationship. We aren’t amazingly close, but we love each other. And we became even closer after they made up with our dad. And even closer when our dad died.

Your feelings are so fucking valid. Honestly, they are. But remember that these kids aren’t the ones doing this to you. And that your dad is an imperfect man who treated you poorly in the past, but is trying to put a foot forward in the future as a better man and a better father to all of his children, including you.

Edit: this also was a process which has taken nearly two decades, and will probably continue for the rest of our lives. But we are still family, and we still have love for one another."
bhge4u,NTA. Sometimes people you love are fucking stupid. My sister thinks crystals have magical properties. Your brother sends unsolicited dick pics. We all have our burdens.

bhgi08,"NTA:

bhgixt,NTA. Holy shit I felt uncomfortable just READING this. Being trans is cool and so is being cis but that is something YOU figure out for yourself. You don’t get fucking chosen for it. Wtf
bhgkgn,NTA. Just split the bills 4 ways and tell him that he and his GF owe for 2 portions. That will at least stir the pot.
bhgkxy,"NTA - She said she would move in, was all excited, and began to move in and then drops it and says “cover my share”. I’d be pissed off too. Sorry this happened and I hope the 3 of you can cover her ass."
bhgnwa,"ESH. Obviously the mother for not feeding her kids. Your sister for being a heartless human. And you, for even thinking you put hungry kids to bed unfed. Two possible solutions:  you get a certain amount of money to feed them OR you stop babysitting for her. If the latter, please also report this. These kids need adult helpers. She’s neglecting her children."
bhgnwg,"NTA. I agree with you. Now if you wanted to maybe make the preexisting characters LGBT, that could be a different story. But it is a show about being black first and foremost."

bhgv61,YTA if you do it. I’ve screwed up enough anniversaries to know. Shit actually I think mines coming up. Thanks for reminding me.
bhh1m6,"NTA.  If it's just a cultural disconnect, he needs to know.  They're most likely not going to fire him, just give him a warning.  I don't think they really end up firing people for this unless there's proof or assault at this point.  If they do fire him, someone else has probably reported it as well."
bhh2lf,NAH after reading they get paid a fair wage. If they bring drinks or are extra friendly it would be nice to kick them a little extra. Quick question though... do you always write the larger number first when giving a range? I have never seen that before and you did it 3 times in your post
bhh4t8,"YTA I know it's uncomfortable, but all these people are coming to celebrate YOU, at great expense and long days of travel, and it is important to your parents that guests be made comfortable. Be gracious. And thoroughly hide or remove from your room anything that might cause embarrasment to you or your guests.

P.S. We're not Indian but we also give up our rooms for short term family guests."
bhh5mm,"NTA, but maybe a compromise of keeping receipts for the improvements. When you do sell then subtract the money you put in and split the rest. Rather than 50% of it now."
bhh7j0,"NAH, you're allowed to not do things like that, but keep in mind that he's also allowed to break up with you over it. In the end sex is a big part of most romantic relationships and you're basically turning the tap from a small drizzle to completely off."
bhh88i,"NTA going against the grain you shouldn't have said ""Control your fucking dog"" but either way he shouldn't let his dog run wild and get all up in people's personal space. Also I feel like 90% of the time when people say their dogs an ""angel"" it usually misbehaves and intrudes on other people's space."

bhhcpm,"NTA, A is being weird you can probably talk to them privately about it before you straight up cut them out of your life, if they are really good friends with your SO."

bhhr3r,NTA. Your house your rules. If he's old enough to make decisions like this he's old enough to find a place to live.
bhhrsa,"YTA

If he smells like BO tell him that and only that. You don't need to specify and make it about curry."
bhhrus,"NAH - except probably the dude. You might check to make sure.  If a random person messaged me I don't know that I would waste time correcting them. My relationship status isn't their business.

I would check with the girl after finals though - she deserves to know if they are still dating."
bhhx6t,NTA. I wouldn't even bring the daughter to the other party.
bhhzlh,"YTA

Your only reason for not attending is jealousy. So yes you are the AH here."
bhi4qr,"YTA. What in the goddamn hell? No wonder your daughter doesn't talk to you. Hopefully your son will do the same. Also, your wife clearly has issues with women if she doesn't get along with your daughter and your sons wife to be."
bhi8od,"NTA, if you’re tired that means you’re not getting enough sleep. So sleep!!!"
bhi9ia,"NAH. This is sound advice, and is all reasonable and well presented. Unless she has some other driving factor you aren't mentioning making her want to quit, then your advice is sound, and would be best for maintaining the relationship as well."
bhie74,"NAH. My guess would be that gift giving is their love language and telling price is meant to be a ""see how much I care"" rather than a guilt trip.

I wouldn't come right out and say ""don't get me anything"" but an open talk about how you feel bad they spend so much money would be good. Maybe instead of banning gifts you can put a price limit on it."
bhihjg,"YTA
Just break up with her dude, unless you can live with her being a flat earther and you think you can continue the relationship but just need a little bit of time, in that case take your time, but do tell her about how you feel."

bhim9r,"NTA

She has been your girlfriend for what 8 months? That's not long at all my dude.

My girlfriend and I had this same conversation a few months back as I am in a position to buy a property. She said she will happily sign whatever is needed to be signed once I buy something to say it's mine and mine only. 

If she genuinely loves you, she will understand you wanting to protect your hard work."
bhimok,"NAH

I think more people should speak up when it comes to people having babies. So many people want the pregnancy, bc of all the glow and people giving you attention, then freak out when it comes to actually taking care of the human they created. Some people get pregnant bc they think it will fix a relationship, or keep one going, when it does the absolute opposite and creates even more stress and problems.

Sometimes a baby will straighten a person out, and sometimes it doesn't...but either way having a baby isn't an experiment to find out or not. 

Your conversation won't be well received, so be prepared for her to get very angry and not want to talk to you... So ask yourself, do you want to fake happiness for your friend, or be honest and get this off your chest?"
bhip3a,"NTA. Your wedding, your call."
bhiqt9,NTA - you're doing your best to fill the spot and if your friend doesn't want to live with this person they should really be helping you find someone else.
bhizkk,NTA- the whole “don’t speak ill of the dead” thing is total bullshit. You are allowed to feel however you feel about someone who traumatized you being gone.
bhj134,"NAH.

Who is paying for the wedding, though?  If you/your partner are, then more power to you.  If your Mum is - then weeeell, she should probably have some say about where the wedding is."
bhj35r,NTA. It sounds like she has a lot of issues and that is not your shit to flush.
bhj3ah,NTA - the agreememt was to help care for your kid in exchange for her living there. It sounds like she is not doing that..it also sounds like she doesnt even clean up after herself. When confronted about this she says disrespectful things about you. She's lucky u didnt just kick her out.
bhj92i,"NTA I'm an artist have the same problem with my (expensive) art supplies. You bought and paid for the rope, you don't seem to even be close with these people either. Honestly they seem like the entitled kind of shitheads who would steal stuff because ""you let them use X thing once"". They aren't entitled to your stuff, hell even people who are family or you've known for years aren't entitled to your things"
bhjhyx,NAH - You are not obligated to like anyone.
bhjnbb,"Cigarette smoke permeates through doors, clings to clothing and fabric, and basically follows you everywhere.  There is no way to smoke in your house and only have it affect one room.  YTA for sure man."
bhjpmi,NTA having a drink with your friends without their SO's is perfectly reasonable. Only thing that could make you the asshole is in how you handled the situation with telling her she couldn't come.
bhjqom,NTA. He’s a 26 year old able bodied adult. He can get a job or go on welfare. He needs a wake up call to figure his own life out and you need to stop throwing money away and focus on your own financial goals. You may as well do this now before he’s 40 and still in the same position as now.
bhjr8k,"NTA but rephrase. Explain that you would love to join in but not having the uniform is making it really difficult for you to feel part of the crew. I would hang in there. I was a cadet and remember a new kid waiting months for custom boots because his feet were so large. It happens in the actual military too.  

Damn - I had to wear old army greens with gaiters when I joined and we ate ration packs made in the Vietnam era. Best jam biscuits ever..."
bhjrbq,"YTA - it was unfortunate for you. but should he have been kicked out or not allowed to see the movie due to his medical needs? i don’t think so. i’m sure it’s much easier for you to deal with his breathing machine in your VIP seat than it is for him to deal with his medical conditions.

edit- complaining to the cinema definitely sold that YTA in my mind. what did you expect them to do?"
bhjsk1,"ESH - not the daughter clearly, but he should never have pursued someone not wanting kids when he had one and you for doing the same. 

I really don’t think it’s right at all to make the child some sort of negative aspect to the relationship."
bhjt5x,"NTA. This is classic r/entitledparents. People think having a disabled kid allows both themselves and the kid to get away with anything and everything in public. The kid isn’t an asshole because she couldn’t help it I guess, but the mother definitely is. It was her job and responsibly to control and manage her kid, and she was way out of line trying to guilt and harass you."
bhjw3y,"NTA. I had to stop all contact with a sibling, and it’s sad our kids don’t know each other at all, but I am glad that my kids aren’t exposed to my sibling’s toxicity anymore. We tried for two years with my eldest child (to spend time with my brother) but my sibling and I becoming parents at the same time ramped up his nastiness to the point where it was a game for him. My kids deserve better."

bhk44s,"YTA  

You criticized her daughters medical decision.  Then called her daughter a quitter.  When you realized that was probably uncool, you apologized for calling her daughter a quitter, but then doubled down on criticizing her decision.  Everything else is really irrelevant.  Keep your opinions about other peoples lives (or deaths) to yourself.  Especially in the workplace."
bhkelp,"NAH.

Don't really see what the issue is - you are letting them try things, so it isn't like you are pressuring them to avoid animal products.  As long as you don't shame them if they decide to switch to being a meat eater, or a vegetarian when they are older there really isn't a problem."
bhkeza,"NAH yet, but you should probably put more effort into understanding why she gets moody when you go out without her. She feels isolated, with you possibly being her only anchor. As someone living in a foreign country right now, I can attest that it can leave one feeling rather adrift, especially if there is a language barrier between you and everyone else."

But seriously, you don't know whether they have just had a miscarriage, or have been trying and been told they can't have any more, or it is an ongoing heated argument because one wants more and the other doesn't

Why would him saying he's not really attracted to people other than his SO make him ""better"" than you? He never says anything like that in the conversation you described. This is your shit, man. These are your psychological issues, your insecurities.

Still he might try to push boundaries bc he doesn’t realize or isn’t thinking, so hold firm. That’s worked with most autistic and Aspergers people I’ve encountered.


PS it sucks you have to deal with this"

As for your question, not dignifying that with an answer."
bht7pd,NAH. Death is THE fucking worst. I have nothing else to say.
bhtbbv,NTA. You can only let family get away with so much. Being autistic doesn’t make him being homophobic okay. I wouldn’t blame you if you cut him off completely.
bhtc5d,NAH but you should speak up. I would be kind of pissed if my wife dragged me 1500 miles to meet her family and ditched me for a girls night and left me with people I barely know or am comfortable with. That’s what a solo trip is for. Her friend can come over and hang with her at her parents house if she needs to see her that badly.
bhtcj6,"Meh.  It's always kind of a dick move to try and make a profit off someone else's kindness.  If someone gives you something and then you don't need it, the normal thing is to pass along that kindness to someone else.  But whatever, not that big a deal."
bhtiki,"NAH. This is communication. Tell her how you truly feel. Talk with her about it to get it off your chest. But don't do it in a way that makes it seem like you're blaming her for anything.

From a non biased standpoint though, she is looking out for you in your better interest. Stick with vaping, please. Don't give into cigarettes."
bhtjmj,NTA- are people really that reliant on their phones that they can’t ring a doorbell
bhtk55,NTA.  You might turn this around on your wife next time she asks for help with laundry.  Tell her that is women’s work and then see what she says.  There is no reason whatsoever that work should be assigned to specific genders anymore.

bhtpt4,"NTA.

I'm going to tell you a story -
My best friend and I have 2 rooms in a 3 room apartment, the third taken by a girl we didn't know until she moved in. She moved out in December, and needed a subletter for the following semester. She found a girl, named X. 

I looked up X on Instagram, just to see who was moving in with us, and saw some sorority letters in her name. I texted a friend in that sorority and asked about her. Turns out, X is a HEAVY alcoholic, mean, and had a pretty serious blackface scandal the year prior. Me and my best friend panicked, and eventually managed to sort things out so that X couldn't move in with us (it involved us snitching to the complex that our roommate was planning to illegally sublet, but sometimes you gotta do that)

It sucked, but we are SO thankful that we did. The alternative would be living with this girl, who was mean, manipulative and racist. It would have made for a terrible housing situation for us all.

Moral of the story, you WANT to know what other people think about your roommate before moving in. Saves everyone a lot of stress later."
bhtrif,"NTA: I only had to read the title to say that. Let me read to give my fill opinion in a second.

bhtyi7,"YTA. If you are feeling up to doing yoga everyday, you can do housework. And it's a bit suspect that your mental health just happened to get so bad shortly after marrying someone that makes good money."
bhu08g,"NTA omg why is health coverage a factor in whether or not people stay with a company? This should not be a normal question 

Jeez this is awful. Take whatever coverage you can get. Basic health care should be a human right and I can't believe you feel guilty just cause you might get coverage.

Why are people even saying you are the asshole here? No one gets hurt by you actually having health coverage. No. no no no. NTA NTA NTA

\* I reread your post after reading the ""you are asshole"" comments and it just infuriates me. nothing about what you did is wrong. Benefits are part of your income, your long term and even short term plans don't restrict you from what income you deserve. That's bullshit. Seriously OP, NTA"
bhu35q,"YTA if you can pay $60 for a bottle of wine, you can afford to tip 20% or you shouldn't be going."
bhu3e3,"YTA - you’re being pretty judgmental all around. “Immigrant” covers a WIDE range of experiences, and that scholarship isn’t only meant for starving, put-upon homeless people. Besides, you don’t have any way of knowing whether your lives would be different if you were born here. You could have been enjoying infinitely more privilege. 

She owned who she was and it benefitted her. You are holding her (and yourself) to unreasonable standards. Lighten up, for both your sakes."
bhu4ta,NTA their employee stole from you.   I don’t think a $100 check for some liquor would be enough compensation for what had occurred. I would post the video and say that she was someone sent by such and such dog walking service.   Don’t let them bully you but do not state any opinion just post video and the facts.
bhu55b,YTA because it's ultimately your poor self-discipline that has caused these events to occur. It's not just the eating fast food that's embarrassing for her most likely; it's also the constant tardiness and the fact that (it sounds like) she has to practically drag you out of bed like a little kid.
bhu8nq,"> I dont hear any concern for her health, just your attraction

But this isn't unreasonable, especially at 21 and 22. 

If there isn't sexual attraction present, their relationship is in deep trouble. Love is great, but for a sexual relationship, it's not enough and it's not sustainable."
bhuapn,"I think ESH.

F1 shouldn't had told you that he believed you were a dick for 3 years,  he should've not stayed friends.

F2 Started this whole mess.

F3 Had to introduce himself when he wasn't involved.

Now you.

F1 did not say the racist term, and even if he did it was only 1 text. ONE TEXT.

Are we gonna start drama and not allow someone to join a chat group just because of one offensive term that was only said once in your entire friendship, which wasn't even sent by F1?

F2 admitted that he said that and we're gonna punish F1 for something he didn't do?"

bhuibb,"NTA. You're the DM, it's your character and game, and it's super acceptable and appropriate for you to cut off any behavior you find problematic, whether it's in character or out of it. If I'd been a player in that game I would have been so uncomfortable with my fellow player's behavior.  

My husband just read this over my shoulder (he is often our DM) and just said, basically, ""Pfff. It's your villain and your story, man."""
bhuk0q,"NTA, but you need to have an explicit discussion vs assuming she is going to change or will automatically be on the same page. It's OK to set boundaries with family."

bhuvo0,"NTA. You're an airhead, not an asshole."
bhuwkv,"NTA, your friend is a toxic person. He has no right to dictate anything, whether they are dating or not. As for her, she sounds like she's bought into his ridiculous expectations and is obviously delusional. Stay away from them both. They both sound bad.  As for dating someone straight out of a relationship, this is bullshit. Different people have different grieve times and to begin with, you were both consenting adults going into this new relationship. Walk away, some people are just not worth it."
bhuwo6,"Sounds like a mild amount of emotional frustration brought upon by a lack of communication. No asshole behaviour from either of you, yet. Provided that your ex pays up and you don't harass him for it, all is well."
bhux43,NTA for $2200 you could have hired a temporary part time caretaker. They have websites for gigs like that.

Stop enabling each other's alcoholism and bond over something more healthy. Then all of these problems are eliminated :) 

(You are being a hypocrite and her behavior when drunk does sound shitty and problematic)"
bhuzp7,"NTA. Why do people think they deserve your attention immediately? Sometimes I won’t text someone like that back for days, but they appreciate me opening it so they know I’m still alive.

bhv78a,YTA Did she wait on you? Then she deserves a tip.
bhv7y3,"NTA. You paid your rent for the month you technically own it for the month, you don't have to leave. The realtor not asking you to leave to your face proves that point. The home I have when I looked at it the guy living here was home and I thought nothing of it."

You're not his mum."
bhvc8q,"NTA, as long as your SO is okay with it. Your choice of children is not your mother's business. Wayyyy too many of her generation are fixated on watching their kids go through pregnancy and it's honestly really weird and gross."
bhvcdj,"NTA, although I know you probably feel like you are. The truth is, people like that need specialized help, of which you are not qualified to offer. If she refused to get help, and you couldn't force her to get it, you can't really be expected to make your life a living hell to cater to her insanity. 

The truth is, there is no gauranteed the same thing wouldn't have happened at your house, or worse. She may have gotten violent and killed you or your husband, paranoia can take a violent turn extremely quickly.

You need to see a therapist, and work out the guilt and trauma of going through this, because even if your head knows you aren't responsible for her death, you are a good person with empathy, and feeling guilty is a natural response.

I wish you the best of luck!"
bhvckg,"YTA. 

You’re going to get a lot of previously hurt users posting NTA because cheating sucks. I know. I’ve been cheated on before. If your sister is cheating, her boyfriend deserves to know. 

You jumped to conclusions. That’s the objective reality of the situation. For anyone who disagrees, reread the post. They weren’t fucking or doing anything more incriminating than being on the sofa watching (I’m going to assume watching TV but IDK). 

If you had more evidence, I’d say tell him. But you didn’t. You could’ve destroyed a relationship  because of a “hunch”. A relationship you claim has always been so close. That’s a shitty thing to do to your sister. 100% YTA."
bhvcnf,"NAH but honestly this points to more overall incompatibility than anything else.

My partner and I both work in competitive industries averaging 70hr weeks. If either of us wanted the other to dial back to 40, we’d probably break up because our careers are an integral part of us and it’s a sacrifice neither of us are willing to make. 

However your gf may not feel the same way and see her work as just a means to an end, in which case she’s not likely to understand your side. I can see a lot of resentment building up over time. Either you resent her for holding you back or she resents you for not being there enough. 

I think it’s a matter of differing values that are ultimately hard to compromise. You’re not wrong to love your work and she’s not wrong to want to see you more."
bhvh6k,"NTA, he sounds like a creep. Trust your instincts. And the sooner you recognize you don't owe anyone time or space in your life, the better :)

bhvrls,NTA and ew.
bhvtci,"tough call - a little ESH because it sounds like maybe your brother does have some stuff going on and you’re unwilling to acknowledge that he might actually need help. But you’re right, that diagnosis should come from a licensed professional, and not your sister who seems to have something to prove."
bhvuox,"YTA - You could have said no, I don't have the time. Do something with full effort or not at all. Not this half-assed foolishness."
bhvxjr,"YTA - the money you owe is real and irrelevant of your personal relationship. The debt doesn’t magically disappear. While on a personal level she sucks for cheating, the two things are completely separate and you would be indeed the only asshole here if you don’t pay her back.

Edit: I just saw you actually have no proof for her cheating. Even though you may be right it still doesn’t change anything."
bhvy6j,"NTA. I’d feel a little differently if he’d had a conversation with you and explained why he was pulling back. However, that isn’t what happened. Ghosting is nasty, especially when it comes from a good friend. 

You’re within your right to choose how you want to move forward. Do you want to revive the friendship? Go for it. Do you want to continue moving on without him? Well, he set the stage for it. 

Whatever you do, I would recommend expressing how this whole thing made you feel and if you choose to cut ties, tell him why. Be better than a ghost."
bhvzep,"NTA, PLEASE TELL YOUR GUIDANCE COUNSELLOR she sounds like she might be under influence of drugs or developing a mental disorder which could endanger you .

You're both assholes for acting like children rather than having a productive discussion like adults

Neither of you were assholes here, but you both oughta work on your communication skills to avoid silly fights like this in the future."
bhwse9,"Nta just walk away. But maybe in the future go to an actual hair stylist and not some rando on instagram. I never understand why people just trust anyone on instagram. 

An actual salon is way more likely to give you a proper haircut because you know those people are licensed."

Well, try not hitting their mother or calling them sluts/whores and maybe you'll be able to avoid being in that situation."

She might have taken it as an insult that you meant she looked funny/weird during sex"
bhwy27,"ESH.

While I don't disagree with your position, you handled it poorly from the get-go. You should've been on his ass from the first month that he needed to pay on time -- your permissiveness got this ball into motion, which led to your brewing resentment that exploding into a rage-filled (yet, not unjustified) tirade. 

Your roommate is an absolute asshole, who should be paying his rent on time and shouldn't need reminders."
bhx272,You are totally NTA. Honestly what both your parents did was a total slap in the face to what you were trying to do with your life not to mention selfish. I would cut contact myself. Also I am so sorry this happened to you. *virtual hug*

bhxet5,"ESH.  Your roommate absolutely needs to take his dog and get it treated for fleas, and you also need to get an exterminator to handle the ones in your apartment.

bhxfey,"I had one rabbit by itself for 6 months. It behaved exactly the same. When we got a second rabbit the change in him as instant, he was so much happier and more relaxed and playful. He’s definitely lonely. But make sure to research how to bond them otherwise you’ll just make things worse."
bhxhh1,NTA. Your actions were reasonable. If she's blocked you on social media and won't talk to you in person then there's nothing more you can do for her anyway.
bhxjg0,"NAH. It's a special trip with you mom, and as much as it sucks not getting to go, it doesn't close out the chance that he can still do the trip at some point. I hope you have a good trip and that your husband gets to go someday soon, too!"
bhxk6z,"NTA,


In many offices that's common approved practice to get people to lock their devices. 


That said, next time give him a break. Or do something a bit less severe, like a halfwritten email but don't click on send. 


Seeing as he now thinks you're bullying him he's not going to get any message you put through. Time to remind him you value him as a coworker. As soon as someone taps out of a prank it's no longer a prank."
bhxnhk,Buy them flowers or cook dinner and tell them the reason you got/did that was to thank them for the awesome room makeover.
bhxnrx,"NAH it was a pure accident, she probably paid for a new one to make herself feel better. All good here!"
bhxtkc,"NTA dude, you didn't know your girlfriend's mother was going to react like that. Plus that was a huge overreaction that you didn't deserve, you were just asking about a dog. Her reaction made it sound like you were asking, ""How would I go about getting a new girlfriend?""

Plus the way she put her hands on your daughter when your daughter obviously didn't want to be hugged, that would piss me off even more than her verbal abuse of you. There's no point in acting aggressively towards the daughter (hugging her tightly when she obviously doesn't want it)"
bhxubq,"YTA. You completely overreacted. You could have been calm and collected, but instead, you came into as if the kid and the mom had shot your dog and danced on its grave. Then you went the extra mile to yell at the kid when they were walking ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD minding their own business.

I've heard places in Europe are much the same way.

EDIT: Better yet, where was this conversation happening? Don't worry you don't have to get specific, do waiters get paid fairly wherever this was?

Now, typically news stories follow a strict format- adding extra time to a story is not taboo, but it is usually discouraged in the real world.

Are you in a position to talk to your professor ahead of time and explain the situation you guys are dealing with? Reassure them that your parts are fine, but Penelope has not been able to complete her part due to health reasons? If She's really having trouble with her mental health- that shouldn't be a problem on the team.  She should be able to get a doctor's note and perhaps have her section of the broadcast graded separately with an extension (this is also a good test for her to see if she's cut out for journalism). Or, be graded separately from the group entirely. 

If that's not an option, I'd stick to what you guys are doing- which is filling in air time.  Because at the end of the day, a deadline is a deadline, no matter what.

Many cultures strongly value family staying close together for their entire lives, my own included. There's plenty of families that live in the same house from generation to generation. But then the new generation raised in a different country has a different perspective, and so they become their own adult rather than stay with the family. It's very possible that OP's father had expectations of staying together, but OP has a different idea of things. Neither is wrong, they just have different expectations. 




I bet it'd work out if OP just talks things out a little more. As it stands, it just looks like an unfortunate lack of communication from distance."

Talk to him about that instead of making it personal. Being an adult isn’t easy.

You can still try to reach out and express your condolences and let them know you wished you could be there. Maybe when it blows over you’ll have time to discuss the process if you want or need to.

People honestly don't know they're being cruel to their pets by keeping them in small places (prime example is goldfish kept in 1 gallon bowls). People don't know and pets are advertised as being suitable for those terrible living conditions.

bi6wwg,"ESH, but more on the teacher. Mental health is just as serious as other illnesses. If that student had a physical type illness, I bet they easily could receive an accommodation, or medical leave with a chance to write a paper or exam in the summer. Finals week my junior year of college I was in a bike accident and got a bad concussion. I literally could not read for 2 weeks. I didn't fail a single class. I simply got incompletes and turned in final assignments during the summer after a doctor deemed I could do mental work without endangering my brain.

I’m gonna take a real stab in the dark here and say this goes deeper than just the card. She brought out ten years worth of cards and said you don’t make an effort. 

Sounds like possibly she’s not getting the kind of attention/affection that she needs from you. 

She’s not communicating well with you and vice versa, hence everyone sucking.

bi9abb,"YTA. I mean, I get your frustration, but given no one knew diagnosis before you went, it was possible that your light lunch could have caused a horrific result for your friend.

I suspect there is a deeper background to your seemingly callous response here that’s not part of this story."
bi9ez9,"NAH - You shouldn't starve yourself all day at work if you don't have to.  But I can understand why a pregnant woman with her hormones all over the place would be upset about such a thing.

Or do something with your immediate family and friends during the day or another day and attend your mother's party in the evening Whatever you do someone will be hurt and you have to make the choice that is best for you.

Also if you feel steamrolled just consider for a moment that your mother has lost 30 years of being the ""birthday girl"" because she gave birth to you on her birthday including big ones like the 40th because she probable had to celebrate your 10th which is nothing to a lot of people but a huge deal to others"

However, their reactions are somewhat understandable as not telling each woman you were also seeing someone else inadvertently gave them the impression that you weren't. 

Going forward it may be a good idea to be more open about your casual dating with the women you're seeing. You don't have to give them every detail, just enough to know when they aren't the only one you're seeing."

I really can’t believe how ungrateful you are being. Your ex voluntarily vacated the apartment, saving the awkwardness of living together. She pays her full share of rent, even though she’s never there. She allows you to take advantage of all her stuff.

Your response is to break the agreement you voluntarily entered into???

No, because you are free to do exactly what she’s doing- anything you want OUTSIDE OF THIS APARTMENT."

There's nothing racist about not wanting to take your underage children to a rap concert and there's nothing racist about not wanting to take your children to a music event that in the past has had trouble with violence. But now your children's teacher has insinuated that your family is racist and she's also planting that seed in your kids heads as well. I would be going above the principle at this point

What??? You are a woman so now you think you know and can dictate what's best for HIS children? No dude, you are way out of line and I get him getting angry at you if say some bull like that. Nothing excuses him for yelling (only reason why he sucks, btw) and, yeah, probably in the long run that's what's best for the kid. But you don't get to say when and how.

The dude is trying to be a good father and he gotta do his way and if you can't handle this then only be there when his kid is with their mother."
bidjbh,"So, look, I’m gonna say NTA because if anybody has brought this shit down on themselves it’s your ex, but you should definitely not do it. Not because it makes you an asshole, but because it’s not going to help you move on or find closure. If anything, it’s going to keep you entangled with him, even if it’s indirect. You’re hurt. It’s gonna keep hurting for a while. But you’re better off trying to find a way forward than trying to make sure everybody else knows how bad you’re hurting."

bie29n,"NAH, you need to look after yourself as well. It is not like you haven't supported him through it all, you clearly showed you cared about him, made sure to look after him and support him, but at a certain point you also have to start thinking about yourself and what is best for you. If you are afraid you will end up hating him or simply cannot support him while being his girlfriend (boyfriend?) anymore, it is totally fair to break up with him. You have done nothing wrong, but neither has he.

&#x200B;

Edit: Since I noticed quite a lot of people saying YTA I figured I'd explain my answer a bit more. I understand that this must be incredibly hard on him and that he is going through hell right now, but I am afraid the OP might be dragged down into his (what sounds like a) depression as well. I do not think it is fair to stay in a relationship with someone when it is making you unhappy or stressed. If it is all too much, it is fair to break things off with someone. I hope you will continue to support him though, not as a partner, but as a friend because it sounds like he really needs one right now.

Your tone was condescending, but I am just going to assume that was not your intention."
bie41n,"NTA 

Doesn’t matter where you are. Community washer and dryer rules are the same.  If you need the dryer and the clothing is done, it’s okay to pull it out. 

If the clothing isn’t done, leave it for a reasonable amount of time (my rule is 30 minutes) if they don’t add time by then, that’s their problem."
bie5sp,[deleted]
bie8r0,"YTA.  Mildly though.  She absolutely needs to know and needs contact information for where the mother is at all times in case of emergency.

It's less if YTA and seems more thoughtless/inconsiderate or inexperienced with being a parent.

If you are experienced at being a parent then it's just thoughtless and inconsiderate imo.

Emergencies happen, always give info on how to reach and where you'll be."
bieaey,"YTA- their relationship is their business.

Your mother shouldn't be compromising your comfort and privacy because of her and your dad's crappy relationship; that's highly unfair.

~~I am going to get downvoted for this, but...~~

Nobody, under any circumstance, should be made to perform a sexual act of any kind that they do not want to do. Now, I know it’s hard for so many people to take men’s concerns seriously in the bedroom, but that doesn’t mean you can just ignore what makes the guy uncomfortable.

He didn’t want to do this specific thing. It doesn’t matter if it’s fair or not. He didn’t want to do it. You made him do it. YTA.

Edit: Unexpected support for this. It’s appreciated."
biefgw,"Nta, for breaking up with him for lying about it. 

However imo I would say you’re in your right to not want to date a guy because he watches anime. It’s your preference, don’t let people make you feel bad for it. 

But I wouldn’t group all guys who watch anime into fetishizing you because you’re half  Japanese."
biehjf,"NAH. Your definition of 'emergency' is obviously different, and y'all should get together to clarify it.

bif5oy,"YTA. You said your fiance is being very supportive with everything and it's a great relationship.

bifmf8,"NTA. Source: staff scientist in a molecular bio lab, been working in labs since I was in your shoes as a sophomore undergrad in 2004. 

Your PI is a walking stereotype, and toxic. There are several things you owe him. You owe him gratitude, you owe him making sure your work is at a convenient point for someone else to take it over, and you owe him making sure your notes and protocols are well ordered and legible. You do not owe him indentured servitude. Go take that other job, but if you really want to throw him a bone, let him know how much the offer is for, and what kinds of hours you'd be expected to work in that lab. If he can match, you can consider staying. But I wouldn't recommend it; some things aren't worth the money, like working for a PI that grinds his undergrads. 

You will learn this as you go through grad school and further your research career, but work-life balance is tremendously important. First, you need time to relax and decompress. Second, if you are constantly in the lab, you are probably not working very efficiently, so it can actually be detrimental to your training to have all the time in the world to get experiments done. You can get a ton done in an 8 hour day, if you train yourself to be efficient. PIs who don't encourage their trainees to learn to be efficient and respect work-life balance are poor teachers and poor mentors."

bigr8y,"I'm gonna go with NTA, from a womans perspective here. It is pretty uncomfortable when you catch guys looking at your tits but most of us do understand that you do catch yourself getting distracted by them, shit if I lassie walked by me with no bra and a see through top I would find it hard not to accadently glance. Growing up with a large chest I'm well used to having both glances and stares, it does get uncomfortable but they are things that easily catch peoples eyes, especially if you're not wearing a bra cause they bounce like all hell.

Go outside! Paints are super messy, even if you clean up. 

What you want isn't always as important. Would you rather be friends with your mom, or get what you want? You sound like a snotty brat to be honest, and I wouldn't ever want to live with someone as inconsiderate as you. 

Also, I read through your post and you kept using the word passive-aggressive, when nothing passive-aggressive was happening. Grow up, people have conflicts and have to communicate their problems, and that alone does not make them passive-aggressive. Please go apologize to your mother, and thank her profusely for cleaning your living space alone.

 Leaving your things (books) in shared living spaces for long periods of time is, by definition, not cleaning up after yourself. It's perfectly reasonable to think that painting will leave a mess. Have some respect for those cleaning up after you, and this has nothing to do with your brother."

Nobody wants to hear this, but I'm gonna go out there and say it cause all the signs are there and your just choosing to ignore it.

THEY ARE JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU

This is not normal friends behavior, people don't just happen to ""forget"" to tell someone. Please go out and make new friends and if it happens again, please consider what your doing that might be making people hesitant to be around you."
biihl7,NAH. this sounds more like a /r/relationship_advice thread honestly and if anything I really think you should be seeing a therapist. You’re still traumatized and hurt from your best friends death whereas this new friend is just trying their best to comfort you. If you feel it’s moving too fast I think you should have an honest and open discussion.

Even if HR brushes off everything else as personality differences (which they absolutely should not do, but might), the comments to customers about you being a ""millennial"" are a form of discrimination/harrassment. Age is a ""protected class"".

Edit: forgot the ""judgement""!"
biikn4,ESH - it makes sense you’d split the fee.  But if you were ordering anyways.  If you were going to drive to pick up food and she asked you to pick her something up would you have asked for gas money
biilcq,"NTA. Based on the examples you've given, it sounds like overdramatic is an understatement. She def needs counseling."
biilvd,NTA. 22 credits is no joke and your roommate should respect your need to excel academically even if her own ambitions fall short.  The semester is almost over - she can give you some space for a couple weeks or so.
biipj1,NTA. i was 100% gonna call you an asshole until i read egg. thats a little ridiculous.
biivnd,"NTA. You need to have a serious conversation with your bf that you don't like the way she's treating you. It sounds like she's being rude af. You feel insulted and unwanted when she's around.

bij2b3,NTA You don't have to look after anybody's children. Seems like she is using you for a favour only
bij396,NAH- What’s this “getting to someone first” trash? She’s not property that can be claimed. She can make her own decisions. Having some tension is normal and time will improve that.
bij3uq,"YTA - You can wait to watch with him so you enjoy this together as it’s something you two have been doing as a unit. Avoid social media and do your best to not talk to anyone about it. And if you get a little spoiler, at least you have a fun happy relationship."

bijf6l,"NTA, but she is going to think you are. I'd just start opening every piece of her mail till she got the point."
bijfwk,"Sure. 

Well, your dynamic just seems like too much *Sturm und Drang*.

You break up, then hate each other, then get back together, then argue and break up.

Then he berated you for not supporting his career as a drug dealer. You, on the other hand, apologised for not being supportive of his career as a drug dealer. 

He then pretends nothing happened for a few weeks, as do you, but then you confront him and he responds immaturely. 

It goes back and forth between you like this and that’s not healthy behaviour. You’re both just being overly dramatic while ignoring the fact that he’s dealing drugs as a career choice."
bijidc,"YTA I was going with NTA up until you said she’s not your girlfriend.

She can do whatever she wants short of sleeping with someone (per your agreement) and you have no grounds to be upset.

In fact. She could just arbitrarily tell you the deal is off and she’s going home with that guy she was dancing with and it’s totally acceptable."
bijk17,YTA. Go talk to them.  I also have a hard time believing the smell is permeating your clothing in a noticeable way.
bijqox,"NAH.  Consider doing it for them.  Take this walk as a loving thank you for your parents' support.  Take it as a ""Fuck you, I'm outta here"" to your program.  To them, this is a moment in which they see their child succeed after all of their efforts in parenting, whatever financial backing they've given you, and all of their emotional support.  It's a few hours of your life to give them memories for the rest of theirs."
bijrrx,NTA- I would report the nasty issues to your city and find a new place to live. It sounds like a health hazard

The only way for people to do nice things for others is if people allow for nice things to happen to them. Accept this, be grateful, but you're not an asshole for letting someone do something nice. On the contrary, if you prevent someone from doing something nice, you're an asshole, even if the recipient happens to be yourself. 

If you have terrible sleeping about it, just pay it forward."
bik96j,"NTA. Have you ever heard guys say don’t stick your dick in crazy? Well, don’t let misogynists stick their dicks in you."
bikfkh,"NTA. That is just pure laziness on her part. Unless this is a drastic emergency situation in which her mom absolutely has to stay with both of you, she really REALLY should have been the one to tell her mom that she can't visit. I'm always inclined to NAH judgements as I like being charitable to a fault, but things like this:  
>My spouse said she had to talk to me about it,  **and she got livid when I reminded her of our agreement**
  
make my blood boil as I've been in many of these situations where someone selfishly violates a fair agreement from before and then gets self-righteously indignant when merely reminded of it.  
  
Also INFO: Is your spouse now demanding that your mom stay with both of you? What's her reasoning and excuse for neglecting to mention your situation to her mother?"

If you’ve got a vegan friend who is cool enough to go to In n Out with you and not shame you for eating meat or make you feel bad in any way, and you make them think they’ve accidentally ingested something they’re ethically against, it’s kind of just an asshole joke.

You can take any promotion you desire. His clinginess has no bearing on that. Extra money is never a bad idea, and he should understand that. 

How long have you been together?"
bim5d8,"YTA, plus the title is misleading. There’s no harm to these things and it’ll be a lot of fun for them to go through all the motions, leaving the cookies out, carrot for Rudolph, shut their eyes really right so they can get to sleep easier, etc. 

Plus your ex might also enjoy that kind of make believe being shared with his kids, and you’d be a dick to take that away from him because you’re too much of a cynic. He’s clearly got fond memories of it from his childhood, and it’s likely something that he’s always wanted to do as a father."
bim63u,"YTA.

Why do you care more about having coffee with this girl more than you do your girlfriend's feelings? 

If there was some kind of pre-existing relationship, that would be one thing, but it really doesn't sound like there is. Can't you make friends that don't have a crush on you?"
bim6dn,"YTA

Instead of *you* trying to *guess* what is causing her snoring, you should have suggested she visit a doctor, and let the *medical professional* figure it out. There's a good chance it has absolutely nothing to do with her weight."

bimilw,"NTA.

Your house, your rules.  If he wants to get laid that badly, he can get a hotel room, like normal people do."
bimmxn,"I'm gonna go with NAH. You have the right to be concerned about your property, and while the timing was unfortunate, you did it (in my opinion) tactfully as an addendum to a thoughtful response, rather than ignoring/interrupting your friend. When your friend told you he was upset about it, you apologized.

At the same time, your friend has the right to be upset about the timing - it's completely understandable that he might have felt a tad slighted. You're helping him to work on expressing his feelings to you, and he did exactly that; while he could have handled it a bit better, it doesn't sound like he whined or threw a fit over it. I can relate to the need for solitude and reluctance to talk to anyone when I feel overwhelmed.

This sounds like a hiccup in a very strong bond. It's rare to find someone who sincerely cares about your feelings and encourages you to express them, as well as someone you're comfortable enough with to do so. Your friend is lucky to have someone like you, and I hope you can get things patched up."
bimrl9,"NTA. While it's completely normal to tell friends you hate them (if one of my friends comes at me with a bad pun, for example), this just seems like a genuinely bizarre interaction and you weren't wrong to be confused by it all.  

It's strange for them to pressure you in this oddly specific way and then get hung up over a joke apology. The whole thing just seems like it stems from a lack of social skills."
bimwiz,NTA.He had it coming.
bimx45,"NAH.  You didn't register that it was hers.  You realized it was hers when she mentioned that she lost her bracelet and helped to look for it.  Did she check with the bank?  Someone may have turned it in.  You're very sweet to think of getting her a replacement, but this wasn't your fault."

bin3fw,"NTA

Boundaries are important in any relationship. She isn't respecting yours."
bin4ed,"NAH.
Personally I think asking two months in advance is early enough, but if people have other plans already thats how it is. You can't expect anyone to change their already made plans for you, so your sister shouldn't expect you to change your plans."

Trust me; when a guy is interested in a  girl, he does not forget when the next date is. Calling you crazy is the cherry on top. Cut ties and move on."

binj5y,"Things you bought for yourself = yours to take

Things you bought and gave to them = YWBTA to take them away again. You could mention the things you would like to take though, and it would all be a non-issue if they say that's fine."
binlgj,"You certainly wouldn't BTA. She sounds like a real manipulator, the type that pulls at your heart strings until you do something they don't like and then move on just like that, in this case, you simply wanted to take things slow which is completely reasonable but she couldn't place herself in your shoes, all she could think about was herself.

Any self-respecting adult should steer clear of these types of people, if they can't understand how others feel then they also can't truly respect those feelings. They'll just use you and move on."
binqjd,NTA - I personally think this could be a good learning curve plus think of how happy it would make the cousin! I actually think it’s a really good idea.
binzzs,">**He said he'd watch it in another room and be careful not to wake me**.

>Middle of the night I wake up to him walking on top of the bed to close the windows. He lies back in bed and leans on top of me to get his glasses from my bedside cabinet. He does it a second time because he didn't grab his glasses the first time. He sits in bed and opens his laptop with his headphones on and the full brightness laptop screen shines in my face. I went to sleep at about 1am so I assume he stayed up. I look at the screen and it says 7am...

Goddammit. How can anyone be so inconsiderate of someone's sleep? And he lied to you on top of that. I'm surprised you put up with it for so long. 

NTA."
bio0kw,I'm very hesitant to go near this with a 50ft pole. But NTA. There is a reason handicapped people don't compete in the regular Olympics. Its not fair someone who was clearly worse won just because she was brave. Wouldn't there be specific tournaments for less able people?
bioe8y,"NTA, you have been clear you don't want anything to do with him, he was toxic for you. You don't owe him anything"

You might want to reach out to the organizers/space owners and tell them that you identify as non-binary, but born as a male. There may still be spaces and events you won’t be allowed in, but others where you’ll be welcomed for your identity. But, you won’t know unless you reach out to them."
biomb7,"Yeah NTA. As a female myself I don’t understand how this would work without making a mess and being unhygienic. There is a thing called feminine products poverty, but this doesn’t sound to be the case here. If she is worried about the environment (you haven’t mentioned that though), there is menstrual cups you can suggest to her."
biome4,"NTA. Your mom took what was more or less clutter and turned it into mementos. I personally like the idea, but even if it had been something that I liked less, they were hers to craft with as she wished. They were changed but not destroyed."
biong0,YTA. Home schooling is a perfectly viable option. Plenty of actors have their high school diplomas and go on to college. Look at Mayim Bialik. She quit acting AFTER high school then went onto have multiple science degrees. Just make it clear that he is to still put effort into his home schooling. It sounds like you have a very talented son.
bioohd,"NTA, your just doing your job, It’s one thing to comment on her personal life when it doesn’t affect her job but this clearly. She needs to stop being passive aggressive about it, and talk to you like a professional would."
bioolj,"I think it depends on who you’re asking. If you are asking me NAH since you’re not even in a relationship with the new chick, let alone an exclusive one. 

If I were the new chick though? YWBTA and I would probably not date you if I found out you were still having an ongoing sexual thing with another woman. I pretty much only date exclusively, so I would end it with someone who isn’t looking for the same thing I am."

bioy4e,NTA. Back off now. Convince you mother and sister to do the same.
bip4us,"NTA - I agree with another comment here that you didn't provide enough information for us to understand what you did. But seeing what the manager (superior) did, I'm going to call that person an asshole. It's more like the office pranks people play on each other and a manager shouldn't be involved. I understand the ""Clean Desk Policy"" many companies have and they make sense and should be enforced. But it's a poor manager that does it this way, either with communicating the policy or enforcing it."
bip65v,"ESH - I don't think a friend needs to send a thank you note after ranting or whining to you, and you give help because that's what friends do. With that said, if the friend never listens to your advice and either goes against what you say or the conversations don't lead anywhere, I think it's worth mentioning that maybe you shouldn't be her sounding board if the type of advice you give isn't what she's looking for."
bip91i,"NAH. You had/have no malicious intent, however your friends reaction is understandable. No assholes here"
bip9xj,"NAH, but wouldn’t it be in better taste if your new husband asked his parents that? in-law relationships can be tricky, and you’re stuck with them now..."
bipggh,NTA at all. friendships require two people and if you’re not feeling it and never tried to be his friend in the first place it’s not your responsibility to pretend.
bipkd4,Nta. It’s shitty of him to assume you were interested & had the money especially after the talk you had with him. I mean that’s almost bizarre.
bipnik,"NAH. This is tricky. Usually in cases like this you never hear an apology come immediately after and on the other party's own accord (he's probably genuinely sorry and didn't mean for it to come off that way). Because of this, I'd probably hold off on telling your boss, but keep this account written down (date, what was said, etc.). If it happens again, then I'd move it up the chain."
bippl5,NAH - your life. Though I would take an hour or so and think about how your husband is who your family will jump at once you are gone for not telling them.  That's how my family would react anyway.

however, he spent 40 years with somebody. and now that they’re gone i’m sure it’s really weird and off putting being alone romantically. since he’s a grown adult he can date whoever but you’re not wrong for voicing your opinion. just don’t demand he stop seeing her"

bipz8d,"YTA

If you have sick days (separate from vacation/PTO days), then use those if you're going to call them ""impromptu mental health days"". Then call those in and DON'T WORK. That's what they're for. 

If it's company policy that you need to be at the office to do work (and it sounds like it is, based on boss' reaction), then go to the office. If you feel you're more effective working from home, work out a flex schedule where you work some days remotely. 

When you're expected in the office and you suddenly don't show up EVEN IF YOU ARE WORKING, that's not professional. Your contribution record isn't going to save you from getting reprimanded/canned."
biq5ti,"Going against the grain on this one, but YTA.

You are entitled to your fears, but once they reach a point where it consumes you and negatively impacts your daily interactions with the people you love, it becomes your responsibility to get things to a point where you can function normally.

It sounds like this interaction, where your dad is trying really hard to cheer you up and you continue to shut him down, happens a lot. Your dad can only take so much before it hurts him, and that's why he yelled.

If your fear of tornadoes is really this bad that it ruins an entire month, go to therapy."
biq9gg,"NTA. If she can't handle working the hours she is scheduled, then she needs to address that with the supervisor herself. It's not your responsibility to take on the extra work she wants to shirk off. This time it wasn't even for a good excuse like having to get her kids, so she has no leg to stand on."
biqbdz,"NTA- Jokes are supposed to be funny. But, no one was laughing. 

He's telling other people that you're not married and pretending you're not married at work is a classic sign of cheating. (I'm not saying he is. I think he needs to be more aware of what this behavior could imply)"
biqc6y,"NAH. There was no prior agreement to paying. He didn’t ask, you haven’t offered. When you get some extra cash, maybe say “hey here’s $10 for taking care of my pet a few months ago, sorry for not bringing it sooner, I’ve been tight on cash.” If he’s your friend, he should/will understand. Again though, there was not prior agreement for pay."
biqdjx,"NAH It's their choice to do this, you might as well benefit from it while you can."
biqh4t,"YTA you chose to work with a partner and instead of trying to be a team and explain in a respectful manner what you think is wrong with his part of the project you’re going to go behind his back and delete his work. It’s amazing how highly you think of your own work I bet he’d have a few things he’d like to change with yours. 

Constructive criticism is fine but purposely destroying everything he worked on is not. If you can’t learn how to play nice don’t do group projects."
biqk2n,YTA - no matter how much of a dick she is misgendering her is petty and an asshole move.
biql2c,"NTA. If it’s your money that you earned and saved up, you’re the one that should be spending it. Considering you’re a young teenager, your parents should honestly be proud of you for saving up your own money for something you want, instead of just going to them."

You made plans and broke them for boba."
bir1of,"NTA. Are you being too kind to these housemates of yours, OP? They're walking all over you, taking advantage of you, and it sounds like chaos. Put firm boundaries up.

You've tried the polite route and if that doesn't work, be firmer. Same thing goes for the shelves in your room! It's YOUR room. Why are you letting someone else use your bookshelves?"
bir3zz,"ESH. I don’t know about asshole, but you are way too immature to be getting married if this is your reaction.

Edited to add a judgment with the additional info that she ghosted OP for two months. Y’all need to talk this through, preferably with a counselor, *before* you do any wedding planning."
bir40m,"NTA - When you grow up, and leave your drug using teenaged brained at any age friends behind, its common not to invite them to your wedding.

If they were actual friends, you would still hangout without the drugs and raves. They are not actual friends. FB friends are not actual friends.

bir5k4,"NAH

She was confused.  You did nothing wrong, it wasn't an accessible spot.  It would have been nice if you would have moved for her but I get being a bit confused about it."
bir6nq,"NTA. 

But maybe your husband would prefer that you upgrade and continue to allow the family to use it without asking them to pay for it. My husband and I pay for lots of little things for our families for no real reason other than it is a nice thing to do. I have the dollar shave subscription for my dad. We do a magazine subscription for his mom. Maybe if it isn't big money, might just be nice to let them have this. Regardless of ""fairness"" or whatever."
birc6t,NTA - If you had refused or just slacked off it would be different. But Chris just went ahead and did and is now being an asshole about it. That’s lame.
birfko,"NAH. You have every right to try to postpone, and she has every right to be upset she won’t get to do this birthday thing with you that she clearly cares about a lot."
birhmw,"YTA because you are mad at him for a completely separate reason than his comment to you when you were playing with the baby. Communicate if you feel the baby duties need to be split up differently, don’t overreact to a small comment that doesn’t really sound rude."
birj5f,YTA. You’re both adults. Handle this like adults. Use your words.
birkjn,"Yikes. Might I suggest some couples therapy first?  What she did was clearly an A move, though I don’t think you’d be in the right to have her move out while pregnant."
birmo1,"NTA

You made it clear the first time you weren't ready for that kind of thing and he continued to push the boundary and got super creepy."
birnqn,"NTA 

I'm not even going to read it. Chances are the company would exploit you in a similar way. Get paid what you're worth."
birrxy,"YTA sorta, but I get it. 

The problem is these games only work if you all stick it out until the end, even if there's no way for some players to dig themselves out of a hole. Do it for your friends, and pour yourself another drink."
birtln,"NAH.  Your coworkers are right you need to bring your A-game when you're working with little kids, and you especially shouldn't be around them if contagious.  But your parents are right too.  Employers don't look kindly on employees who are constantly calling in sick.  Your parents aren't being assholes, they're trying to look out for you."

As long as you go about it respectfully and talk to your boss with tact, there should be no issues.

It was a mistake on your part, but it was unintentional and not done to be mean. Them being upset is valid though because they didn't know you were talking out of your ass about the ending."
bis2le,"Ultimately, NAH, but as a broke college girlfriend, if my boyfriend went to Japan without me (we have been planning to go), I would be a bit upset, regardless of the circumstances."
bis4d8,YTA if you say anything. It's not your place to say anything. You're allowed to be bothered by it but it's not your problem to fix. Some people just have serious issues with expressing affection.
bisaug,"YTA. A mistake is one thing, a drunken mistake is another. She wasn't in her best state and you making fun of her is pretty fucked. After sobering up she was probably really fucking embarrassed of what she said to him. There was no need to rub it in. Hope you apologized well enough."
bisccd,NTA. Boys night out is perfectly acceptable.
biskdx,"NAH. you could say something like ""hey everyone, SO's birthday is coming up, here's some things he's been talking about if anyone's interested!"""
biskt1,NTA. I think it’s perfectly reasonable for him to ask if he can bring you. I don’t really see what is awkward about it.
bisln4,"NAH.  You're hurt.  It won't go well for you if you still are.  Maybe you can be friends down the road, but you're not there.  She will be there faster; she broke up with you.  Her feelings were not as hurt.  You may never get there.  That's all fine.  But take care of yourself."

>I could see it coming. They were constantly fighting

So you admit that your parents were both clearly unhappy in their relationship, and you even understand that they needed something better than their unhappy relationship.

>I know she isn't a gold digger.

Honestly, YTA right here, but let's continue.

>She's very pretty and super nice to us which makes me hate her even more

Grow up. You're showing the jealousy signs of an 8 year old meeting their dad's new girlfriend, not a 14 year old. Your dad has met a nice woman he works with who is making an effort to be kind to you, and you respond with hate and name-calling.

>my dad isn't having a crisis so I don't get why they're together?

>she works at the same company

>She's very pretty and super nice

>She has a good job and a normal family/social life

Are you serious? Every description you give of this poor woman makes her sound like a wonderful partner for your dad. The age gap is a little high, but she doesn't seem to be after him for his money, is it really *so bad* that your dad has found someone that makes him happy?

>My brother is really dumb and immediately liked her just because she's 'nice and pretty'.

This woman is being kind to both of you, seems like she cares for your dad, and has even made the effort to bring her boyfriends kids (that's you and your brother!) on fun outings like movies or the zoo in an attempt to bond with you. These are not the actions of a gold digger, they are the actions of a caring adult who wants to be part of your lives because she loves your dad.

>I do my best to show her that she's not welcome

You're being cruel to a person who seems to care about you, despite your terrible behavior. Think about that.

>I don't think I'm wrong to protect my mom and my family

You aren't doing either of these things. Your mom and dad are broken up. You aren't helping anyone by hurting your dad's new girlfriend. 

In summary, you are *so much* the asshole here. You are young, but not young enough to not know better. This woman is a good thing in your dad's life, and you are hurting her for literally no reason other than your own jealousy. Your actions are not helping anybody, you are not protecting your mom, you are not helping your family, you are creating problems and need to grow up and apologize to your dad and his girlfriend."

biwpi8,"NAH on the question itself, I have more to say though

>Would I be the asshole if I broke up with her now? Should I wait for later?

This bit tells me that you've made up your mind on the end result, and that's okay. Break ups don't inherently mean one party is awful. 

The issue I have is staying just because she's having a tough time when you've already emotionally checked out is very... fake. I get that being as close to the situation as you are it seems like decency, but I don't agree that providing a false sense of stability is the decent thing. I mean what happens when her life levels out? You throw it into disarray again with ""this was a good time to break up."" If you're done, be done.

This sounds like a miscommunication / different communication styles. The fact that your mum wanted to take you out for a nice dinner shows she *does* care.

biyy9d,"NTA. It can be awkward entering that age group when some of your peers have had kids and others haven’t. Like you, we don’t have any kids yet but many of our friends do. Despite this, we make time to see our friends, both with and without their kids present. It seems your friend has consistently made her kid a priority over maintaining friendships. This is especially hurtful given the very reasonable options she has to get some alone time with her buddies (ie having her husband spend time with the kid on certain evenings). While you’re not an asshole for wanting to spend time with your friend without her kid present, it’s tricky knowing how you want to proceed. Your best bet is to talk with her about your feelings (may be awkward since her kid will probably be right there too!). Take that chance to hear her perspective on the issue: does she want alone time with friends but feels guilty taking it? Have her interests evolved now that she is a mom, ie Is she interested in doing different activities with her friends on a night off (pottery class instead of dinner/drinks)? Is there more going on behind the scenes at home that you’re not aware of? Or is it simply that she wants to spend 24/7 with her kid, even if it’s at the expense of every other friendship and adult interest that she has? Parenting a small one is exhausting and can be isolating, it’s hard to imagine not wanting to take a break with a supportive friend if you could..... give her a chance to explain her side of things. You may ultimately be in the difficult position of asking yourself if her approach to parenting is a dealbreaker for you. Best of luck to you both!"

That being said, your coworker's claim that you're a racist is ridiculous and annoying as well as incorrect.  If this colleague is white, and so are you, then there's no chance of racism being in play.

she once brought up to me how frustrating it was that I would get further ahead in shows.  So after a bit of talking we decided that the **quote** *important* **end quote** shows (as chosen *by her*) I would not watch ahead in.  

This system works really well.  There are a few shows I just flat out turn off AS SOON as she goes to bed.  Anything else is fair game.

bj3nvn,"YTA — But hear me out. I don't think you're an asshole for the tattoo itself, it seems like you put a lot of research and care into the symbols, and it's meaningful to you.

The reason I'm saying this is because you flat out said you view someone's religion as a fairytale, and referring it as so. You can be respectful of it, but saying some of those things in itself is disrespectful. You can say, ""i don't personally believe in this idea, but enjoy their symbols and the meaning behind them."" rather than ""This belief is a fairytale.""

I'm native too, and I don't quite believe in what our ancestors believe in either, though I am religious. But if an american girl told me my beliefs and cultural ideals (because voodoo is very much cultural in parts of the world) were fairytales, then I would be extremely offended, but insanely less so or not at all if they said they didn't believe in it but enjoyed the lessons behind it."

You were so close to not being an asshole until this:

It's worth having some additional conversations to understand what these things mean to you that they make you uncomfortable. To me ""PDA"" means kissing/making out, and that can be gross for other people to see.

On the other hand you are including holding hands or even his hand just brushing against yours as a type of PDA, and I wouldn't characterize it that way. Hand holding is sweet. It's what parents and kids do, and friends walking comfortably with each other will touch shoulders or hands. There is nothing about it flags anything negative to me, or even overtly sexual. 

So be clear that you are not just uncomfortable with PDA such as kissing, but you actively dislike any physical contact, even a light touch or hand hold.

If you grew up in a culture or household where male / female contact was forbidden, then I would understand a context for your discomfort with any public touching.

If it's not your culture or upbringing, it might be worth talking to someone about where this fear and discomfort is coming from. And I hope your boyfriend will give you some space (figurative and literal) to figure this out."

You just have to accept that you're going to burn the bridge. So if you don't care about working there again, or getting a reference from there, and if there's not a concern that your boss would be able to effectively blackball you at other places, then you don't need to be a martyr for two more weeks."
bj9mb3,"YTA. There was a much, much better way to communicate your frustration to your mother than flipping her off. From your story, it doesn't even sound like you made it clear to her that you were feeling sick and couldn't talk. Regardless, flipping her off was wrong and there are probably 1000 better ways to handle it than that. You should apologize"
bj9mty,"NTA. She should have consulted with the landlord first and also with you. It sounds like your finances are combined (I'd imagine this is the case if you have 2 kids), so it should have been a group discussion. Mocking you is also an asshole move.

P.S. - Satellite internet sucks and costs a fortune for anything half way decent. An unlimited mobile data plan is often the better route."
bj9myn,"NTA. You're paying for delivery, not almost-delivery. I do the exact same thing. Whenever Uber Eats calls me to let me know they're ""out front,"" I always ask them to bring it to the door. They get huffy sometimes, but I'm not paying a delivery fee AND a tip if I have to put on my shoes, walk outside, and pick up my food myself."
bj9qlk,"NTA - the waiter really shouldn't have tried to look at your survey, that seems invasive. I do however understand that she was having a really shit day and she honestly should've been allowed to go home after finding out about her divorce since she wouldn't have been able to serve well with that shit on her mind."
bj9r64,"NTA. She lacked common courtesy, maybe she needed a bump back to reality where social order is upheld"

He proved that he didn't want to be a part of your life. Now you can do the same"

Disgusting."

bjaesl,"NTA

It's your stuff, you define the terms of use. If they break that then you are perfectly within your right to ask them to stop using it."
bjahve,NTA. It's an animal waste bin.
bjajfi,"YTA

I don't even understand why people are saying NTA. 

How do you know this isn't the thing she needs? Why would you discourage a friend from something they are interested in? 

Like, sure, it's okay to ask leading questions, get to the root of it, get them thinking. But please, for the love of the great green earth, please don't directly discourage her. That would be such an asshole move. This could be a thing that finally gets her engaged. It might not be, but it *could* be. Don't be the person that discourages her from it just because of her past."
bjapwt,"NTA.  You gotta do what you gotta do to get them to do the basics.  No apologies.  When my son was 3 the commercial advertising the Lord of the Rings was on TV and it showed a picture of Gollum creeping out of the darkness.  Son asked, horrified, ""What IS that?!?""  and I told him ""that's a little boy who didn't eat his vegetables.""  

There was a substantial increase in the veggie consumption after that.  I'm not sorry.

Good luck with your little booger."
bjarjd,NTA that's not how giving things works if they gave it to you then you own it
bjastb,"YTA

Contrary to popular belief, being ginger and pale is not a death sentence"
bjaw02,"of course there were better ways you could have handled it.

still NTA. guy sounds like he sucks"
bjawgs,"NTA, I would print out your grades from before you started working and after. Show her that forcing you to work in jobs that will probably not take you anywhere considering you’re still in HS, is just making things worse. If she’s keen on you working, maybe see if you guys can work something out and find somewhere you want to work. Look around for job openings, and if there isn’t any there you like, maybe you can do volunteer work instead. At least then you’ll be getting out, you can pick what you want to do, and it’ll look good on college applications if you continue your education after HS."
bjb11c,"NTA. We have favorite and closer friends. Other friend is being immature, which I would wager is part of why they aren't the closer friend."
bjb1lt,"NAH here. She can point out that some might find it offensive and you can continue to wear it.   


But honestly, I think it's super weird to wear a hockey jersey if you aren't a hockey fan. And the whole concept of using a group of people with unique cultural traditions and heritage as a mascot is just kind of racist. [Many Native American groups](http://www.ncai.org/resources/ncai-publications/Ending_the_Legacy_of_Racism.pdf)have called for ending the tradition of using their people and images as mascots."
bjb3il,"NTA. 1. You're a longterm customer that has spent a decent amount of money. 2. You still buy things, albeit rarely 3. You bring them food 4. Ultimately, if it's a problem then it's their responsibility to tell you. You'll likely either hear something explicit about it or get bad vibes if your behavior is unacceptable."
bjb5wg,"YWBTA - I was fine until you said you wanted to get a new cat. If you don’t have time to care for a pet, don’t have one. All pets have needs. Seems like an excuse to get rid of your cat because you just want a better one that isn’t as demanding. Your cat has separation anxiety so your solution is to get RID of him and get a new better one? Asshole move."
bjb71l,"NTA - I feel so bad for your Grandparents. To have the son they raised now call them by their names and then call this new person ""Mom"" and then bailing on them for mother's day. That is hurtful."
bjb994,YTA - that’s asking a lot of a “roommate” and because they are scheduled to be there from 9:30 - 7:00 “shifts” they’re essentially working for 45+ hours per week in exchange for a room worth...800/month? That’s like $4 an hour. I’m surprised you found someone willing to do this for that arrangement +$200. Take them up on it before they realize how bad this deal is for them and change their mind.
bjbaud,"Edit: since I’m here I might as well judge you. I’m gonna say ~~NTA~~ NAH (I forgot there was such thing as NAH) if you have a grown up conversation about how the pictures make you feel uncomfortable but you would be the asshole if you demand that she removes them or doesn’t post them.

I don’t really have judgement but why do people do these kinds of pictures? I really don’t understand the obsession with people giving themselves a wedgie and then taking a picture of it."
bjbb76,"YTA - only because I can’t put no assholes, it is kind of asshole-ish. Not extremely. I get why you asked but it was emotionally manipulative. 

You should talk to these things with a therapist. This ex of yours asked you for space and you used your last communication with them to manipulate them into forcing you to behave. This speaks to other harmful dynamics you might be engaging in that led to the breakup in the first place.

Do I think you meant to be the asshole? No. But we’re you? Kinda."
bjbct6,"NAH, but honestly this is such a big thing I doubt you’ll get any valuable input from strangers on the internet. This sounds like a pretty big discussion you need to have with your husband."
bjbfmh,"NTA:

I've had to deal with people like this...ignoring them is the best thing you can do"
bjbjax,"NAH. But I wanted to point out “no visible signs” of pregnancy doesn’t mean it’s not affecting you. At seven months pregnant I was fine; at two months, I could barely stay upright."
bjbjj0,"YTA. 

For both that formatting, and for giving any grief at all to someone buying you a luxury that you want."
bjbjl1,"NAH, but you should probably figure out if you are sexually compatible or not."
bjbrn2,"NTA, it doesn't sound like you were rude about quitting and I don't see how your manager thought they were going to convince you to stay by acting that way when they knew you were already out the door."
bjbxrl,NTA. Set boundaries with your animal. Maybe give him his very own fuzzy blanket so he can frickle frackle to his little heart’s content.
bjbzug,"YTA

sorry bro, weddings are fucking expensive and the RSVP is basically saying 'i promise to be there for the really expensive shit, that will be wasted if i dont show up' also you left it way too late. When did you know the date of the exam?

bjc3xw,"NAH Everyone is trying to make nice things happen for people they care about. Your brother wants his fiancé to be there based on her schedule, and that’s much more difficult to rearrange than dinner out. I say have dinner with you mom the next day, and let the whole family be together Friday."
bjc6xs,"NTA at all. You did what you felt was healthy for your new relationship, and this girl didn’t sound like a very good friend anyway so this was probably just a good move whether you’re taken or single."
bjc7du,"NTA- first of all, SHE lives with YOU. Not the other way around. That means your house your rules. It’s your roof. Second of all you’re a grown ass woman you’re allowed to have sex toys."
bjc8ei,"NTA

""Brutalize""?? Gimme a break. You don't have to show her your ID and she was pretty aggro about it. If she was just nicer and less hostile the whole situation would have been way different."
bjc98f,"NAH - A lot of people need isolation/alone time as part of their self care. It may confuse your friends/family but I’m sure if you explained your ghosting is not about them or you not liking them/caring about them, that it’s about you taking care of yourself, they’d understand. 

If you’d like to modify/change this behavior speaking to a therapist would be a good idea."

Do your Goddamed job like an adult."
bjcext,"NTA. Your bf has double standards. And just for fun, I think you should become the biggest Jason Momoa fangirl out of the blue."
bjceyt,"INFO:

How much do you do around the house? How much responsibility do you have besides just taking the trash out? Is that the only chore you do? 


Tbh I'm leaning towards YTA. Mainly because you know the expectation your mom has for you to complete this chore. If you know she wants it out by 7pm on Tuesday and in by 10am on Wednesday, I don't see why you can't just do it without having to be asked or nagged, which I'm assuming is probably the main reason your mother is upset. It also doesn't seem a very unreasonable request even if she's going about it the wrong way."
bjcgc1,NTA. Your aunt's behavior is dangerous. But I would reccomend getting her checked in at a facility instead of just kicking her out and avoiding contact. She isn't going to get better by moving houses.

And kinda bad at parenting.

Where was the conversation about WHY she wanted to do this? She is at an age where she is starting to notice things, her peers starting puberty, what media feeds us as standards of beauty... Serious stuff that requires conversations. Not taking away video games.

Your money, you do what you want with it, but if you're talking about having the TV in a shared space that you both pay for he is just as entitled to use that space.

If you want to keep the TV to yourself put it and your playstation in your room.

They did a shit job keeping it on the downlow knowing it was wrong.

Regardless if you said anything or not, you're in the right. Not your problem either way."
bjd4xc,"ESH.

You should have formally quit to not screw over your coworkers, but I couldn’t care less about your company. Company loyalty is a stupid idea because the company isn’t loyal to you back. Corporations will never give a shit about you so you shouldn’t put them above yourself, either. Plus, I’m not going to lose sleep feeling sorry for execs raking it in from 20mil deals, fuck that.

That said, I do believe in solidarity among fellow workers against corporate bullshit. So would I have jumped ship to the other company? Hell, yeah. But I would have communicated first and foremost with my coworkers to help prepare them for the transition. It’s not my coworkers fault shitty bureaucracies and short sighted capitalist greed has caused the higher ups to wrong me.

And if I was part of a union I would’ve given my union a heads up I was leaving, too, but I don’t think it sounds like that was a factor."
bjd959,NTA. STFU or watch it on Netflix later.
bjd9u4,"NAH. You have certain feelings and you addressed them with respect for hers, by the sound of it. This may be a case of simply having incompatible values. If something someone does crosses your personal line and when you bring it to their attention it creates conflict, you either need to come to a compromise, to evaluate your personal bottom line, or to figure out just how much of an issue this is for you. If her behaviour makes you uncomfortable you dont have a right to demand change, but you do have a right to have your feelings heard and to decide where to go from there."
bjd9zt,"Oh wow. Your class also has that guy. It has been years since I was in college and I still cringe when I'm reminded of that particular student. They aren't necessarily assholes, just highly unaware and a smidge self absorbed.

bjdf5b,"NTA.

You were nice it seems, and she wanted to go in the opposite direction. Sounds like she's annoyed other coworkers too since she's trying to barter so much with you"
bjdhm0,"Did you actually talk to a doctor about this? A lot of western doctors actually send women to the Eastern medicine clinics because they are supposedly a lot more helpful with fertility than the western kind without being as invasive. I come from a family of doctors. You should probably consult a professional instead of deciding that your ignorant opinion trumps her ignorant opinion. Also, it's one thing to tell her you're skeptical, but to tell her that ""I'll be disappointed in you if you get scammed"" is weirdly condescending, dude. YTA for that passive aggression."
bjdke8,"YTA. You made the commitment, plain and simple."
bjdkpk,"ESH.

But you particularly, adding a ton of unnecessary information. Let me make it more succinct for you:

>""I work at a gas station. I saw a guy shoplifting, I stopped him from doing so, extorted 100 bucks from him, and said I'd call the cops if he didn't leave. The next day he was mad.""

...He's a thief, so automatic asshole there. You're a thief, so automatic asshole there. So everyone sucks here."
bjdlg1,NTA. He's taking the risk to be spoiled by watching them later.  It's not your job or everyone else's job to cater to him. You're being way too generous by waiting a week.
bjdltb,Your brother isn’t an asshole. He’s a dick
bjdmih,YTA. That was embarrassingly petty. Either have an adult conversation with him about what he did or don’t talk to him. Making his life difficult is just a dick move.
bjdrk7,"NTA.

Some people take their superstitions very seriously, and your MIL is clearly one of those people. She shouldn't force that on you, and that is where your husband should step up. You said he agrees that it's nonsense and he came up with a ""solution"", but the principle stands. Your husband should stick up for you over his mother, especially when his mother is treating you this way."
bjdrt9,"NTA. If the dudes religion means he can’t be around tits, he should avoid places where there are tits. It’s not everyone else’s problem to cushion his fear of women’s nipples."
bjdseb,"ESH. Britney's a bully and incredibly stuck up. You went too far in responding. I have no idea why Andy is involving himself in this, and ""considering not speaking to you for a few days"" is just immature."
bjdtcp,"NTA.

If he asks what you think, be honest. Life needs more honesty in it.

If he doesn't ask but you feel the need to tell him, put it in a nice way. ""Hey *insert friend name here*, man if I'm being totally honest, I don't think that nose stud fits you. You're kinda one of those *types* of people that *x* looks better on you instead."""
bjdu8n,"NTA. That's way too young for cosmetic surgery.

Bonnie sounds like a narcissist though. Probably best to just let your friendship with her end. Treat her like law enforcement; anything you say can and will be used against you.

bjdzhr,"YTA. Let the man sleep. Imagine if gender roles were reversed here what people would say about a dude waking his gf up for sex whenever he wanted, irrespective of her schedule? Show him some basic consideration."
bje46s,NTA - tell her immediately to stop talking about him and keep him away from you. Keep yourself safe. Don’t put yourself through that shit for her or him.
bje48t,"YTA. You introduce your post talking about how fat she is and then say you cut her out because you're not friends with her. No, be honest, you cut her out because you thought she spoiled your photo."
bjep9m,Ywbta: Geeze if he never practices he’ll never get better and you’d trash his confidence
bjesfx,"NTA. But you aren’t the brightest tool in the shed, uh?"
bjetx7,NTA they need to grow up.
bjevxz,"NTA. You make a tough decision that is in the best interest of your friend. They need help, heroin is not a joke."
bjf0nh,"NTA - he needs to learn that if he wants breakfast he should get out of bed and go with you.

Have your parents had him checked over physically ?  Sleeping that much is a bit of a worry."
bjf1qy,NTA. You are not doing because you feel gross. You have a health issue associated to it.
bjf2nu,[deleted]
bjf5xp,ESH. It’s customary and professional to give two weeks notice before leaving a job. There may consequences for leaving as you plan.
bjf747,YTA; the world doesn't revolve around you. You can't expect your friends to babysit you.
bjf9bs,"NTA, provided employment is one of your goals for treatment. She’s trying to force you into something that you’re just not ready for, which could have major consequences."
bjff0u,"NTA - Leave. LEAVE! Your life has been in danger multiple times and you've suffered severe abuse. She's a piece of shit and the fact you came from that piece of shit doesn't mean you need to spray perfume on her and pretend she's a scented candle.

Couldn't resist making that analogy... But seriously I'm sorry she's your mother and I'm sorry for what she's gone through too. But you deserve better and you are not in the wrong for wanting out. You shouldn't have had to endure what you have and she did not protect you in any way shape or form. She treats you and everyone else like filth. She's not your mother in any meaninful way."
bjfi3h,NAH. They miss you and want to spend time with you. You're busy and stressed and need time to yourself. Tell them you want to spend time with them but that you need to plan it ahead of time. That you had been really needing a day to relax. Ask if you can go have dinner together in a few days (or whatever and whenever suits you).
bjfjuv,"YTA, simply for the reason you never talked to them about it. You should have explained your situation to them first and asked them to stop their baby from crying or you would take action. But it it seems like you gave them no warning and it's possible they didn't even know their baby was disturbing people.

Edit: After reading some replies it seems like them not knowing was a stretch, but he still should have talked to them first."
bjfn52,NTA they sound like immature little bitches.
bjfq5n,NTA but jeez do they sound like they have way too much time on their hands or something.
bjg36t,"NTA- my nephew is going through the same thing right now. I told him as long as you’re home not paying rent and a phone provided by his parents you need to play by their rules.  Don’t like it, get a job and get your own phone is the easiest thing to do."
bjg3a0,"NTA, tell her boyfriend that she's blocked you for asking why her and her workmate were going on dates"
bjg3br,"NTA - the guy should use the crossings that are for pedestrians. He is asking to be run down especially walking towards a car.

You stopped 2 meters infront of the person - lets say 1 meter - that is further away than any car would stop from a zebra crossing in the UK!

This isn't one of them but things will happen when you're driving - you need to take them on board (when required) or quickly forget about them if they're not important (like this)"
bjgbrv,">Afterwards, I thought it was kind of unfair because I did not even spend that much time there

>During the three hours I sat there

***. It's a business, not a library.

Edit: Changed my vote -- ESH. You should have the self awareness and understanding of social norms when it comes to hanging out in a place of business for hours, especially in a cafe/hospitality business where you're taking up space for hours that could be used for other people who are actually spending money. However, if they wanted to police the amount of time you spend in the restaurant, and uphold a ""1 drink per hour"" rule, they need to have that in writing somewhere."
bjggf5,"> I have a 1500 dollar credit card that I would like to pay down  

NAH, yet.   

You need to make this the main point. Not that he owes you anything. Not that he got extra money because of you. It would benefit both of you to pay this debt down as fast as possible."
bjgjq6,"NAH, however you might wanna talk about it again with him and describe what it feels like for you. Since it is bothering you probably way more than how he thinks it is bothering you.

bjgmc7,"NAH, give it to him in private"
bjgnx0,"NAH, but tread lightly."
bjgr07,"NTA. Go to the doctor.

bjgwsl,"YTA. 

1. You know they’re not being used, you’ve already asked. Asking repeatedly doesn’t help. 

2. You gave gifts that aren’t usable, and told the person to fix it themselves? Why aren’t you completing these gifts — you say you ran out of time, but it’s been months now. 

Now, asking if they’d be more useful if.. or if she doesn’t like the style or whatever, likely a different story."
bjgxqq,"NAH. You're not wrong to feel irritated about her misuse of the word ""broke"" - yeah, I've had to leave things behind in the grocery store line because I didn't have enough in my account, so I feel you - but she's not TA. That's how she conceptualizes her money. Nothing left for entertainment that month? She calls it ""broke,"" you call it ""budgeting."" It might be annoying, but there are NAH.

Edit: You would not be TA if you talked to her about it, but the convo might not go so well. Be prepared for hurt feelings and miscommunication."
bjh8mh,NAH but there's not really anything you can do. It's fine you don't want to raise your child as religious - you can teach him what you want during your time with him  - talk to him about other religions or no religion - there are tons of kids books for you to share with him on the topic. It's also understandable your ex wants to teach your son about his religion - he is free to share that when he has your son. Your son can decide when he's older what he believes.
bjhaaj,Your brother is not looking for work. That is obvious. You have enough info. It's just a matter of whether it's worth the hassle of creating an uncomfortable living situation for the next 40 days. NTA
bjhav6,"NTA, but I also don't like the idea of pulling your kids out. I've worked in preschool settings and the bond some kids make with their caregivers have a lasting, wholly positive impact. Also, I'm not sure how it works where you live (I'm in the UK) but if your kids are 4, will they be moving on to school fairly soon? It might be detrimental to move them so late in the term, right before ""big school"".

I think it would be a bold stand and I agree wholeheartedly with your reasoning, so it's a tricky one. My heart breaks for the new mum. Is there anyone above the director you could speak to?"
bjhbuu,"NTA, there’s a reverse gear for a reason."
bjhd1k,"NTA You recognizes that a relationship was going to be a bad influence on you and you got out. That’s the healthy choice.

You COULD let her know why in hopes it makes her see what she’s doing, but that may not go well."
bjhdmb,"NTA, I would say NAH except he makes fun of you to the point of hurting your feelings. He says he doesn't care but then insults you until you dye it back and that is definitely asshole territory. 

Personally my wife is in her 30's and dyes her hair all the time all different colors and I love it, you do what makes you happy and tell him to quit being a dick about it."
bjhdmw,NAH - parents can't expect their children to keep every single thing when they pass - it sounds like you do have some things you will cherish and depending on whether these things are valuable it's probably  better for them to know what you actually want. They can sell it and enjoy the  money or leave it to someone who would enjoy it if it's an important piece to them.
bjhmke,"YTA. I understand where you're coming from, but you should at least talk to your dad about this and see how to proceed. Going behind their backs will be seen as an ""undermining"" attempt and would easily create more problems in the future (argument between you and stepmom, stepmom and dad, etc.)"
bjhmkp,NTA. Offer her the advice and hopefully she takes it.
bjhnog,"YTA, I see where you’re coming from but you should’ve consulted your friends first before making the decision to buy the card."
bjhqfq,"NAH. 

The teacher can make the request and you can refuse it. There are big issues with erasing the identity of non-binary folks in media, and we tend to ignore them. You don't think it's relevant, which is fine, but the teacher also isn't wrong."
bjhvch,"In retelling this to one of my friends, she remarked that if this girl's feelings are still stinging after so long, she's the real victim and I should have been more tactful to her.
______________________________________________________
Wait, so she's a victim simply because she's been pining for your fiance for a long time instead of moving on with her life?

NTA."
bjhvm1,NTA.  If the landlord had just given a verbal reference then this wouldn't have happened.
bjhzn0,I think you should make a case for moving to an online system... signing a piece of paper in person is ridiculous at this day and age. Honestly when I was in college we just used a facebook group to manage shift switches for work.
bji2aw,NTA - If he's your friend you should tell him. Maybe get some screenshots of the convo for proof. Doubt he'd believe you without evidence.
bji3pm,"YTA

Your nice won't be graduating from college again, and this is your only chance to be a part of her graduation ceremony.

Meanwhile, your six year old will probably be upset for a day or two and forget about it in the long run. Moreover, you can always take her to a fun run next year."

Death by mono is extremely rare. If she was worried she would die she should go to the hospital. It's not realistic to expect someone to skip work due to her being sick. Also, if she was so worried about her health she should have asked u to stay. You are not a mind reader."

You’re a child. He’s an adult. He needs to grow up and take care of his kids.

bjjrxa,"NAH yet... It sounds like you both had different expectations from the start. It was discussed that you would pay for the trip before. That, in your mind, changed when you were laid off. Her finances didn't change, so she assumed the plans didn't either. It just sounds like you both need to sit down and talk about it. You looked at plans and waited for her to say something and felt disappointed that she didn't. You needed to initiate that conversation. She may not realize what you're currently feeling."
bjjshv,"NTA at all.  This is your life.  Your name is on the lease too.  Be firm.  If he does not back down start making plans to get your own place.

Big question: is his mom on the lease?  EDIT: if her name is not, then do not let her move in.  she will set up shop and like a parasite undermine the household.  

If he cannot accept that, get out of the lease and have it re-written so that your BF and his mom are the signatures.  get your own place or stay where you are.  Have an exit plan and savings that he does not know about.  These kind of families drain your money and emotional resources quickly.

EDIT 2: He is TA bc he refuses to communicate:

>Now we’re not really talking about it because he doesn’t want to argue. He’s keeping to himself. I don’t want to argue either but I feel like this is definitely something that needs to be discussed AND prevented."
bjjtg6,"NTA- ... however... Karma will do what it does, you don’t need put your neck on the line for her screwed up life. She obviously does not mind hurting people, so best to keep your distance from her in any way possible."

It sucks you mom wasn’t a able to teach you, but you’re an adult now. You can take care of these things on your own. Get a job and a tutor and start getting your work done

Edit: just gonna throw in an ESH. Your mom shouldn’t have put you in homeschool. However, you do have control over what you do for yourself. I go to a fully online school where I basically have to teach myself through the material as I don’t have class. I use a combination of google and my textbooks to do this. You obviously have access to the internet where you can get answers to any questions you need. You can get a job to pay for a tutor and you can pay for your own GED. Stop putting so much blame on everyone else but yourself. Even when you’re in a bad situation, no one is going to fix things for you. You will have to dig yourself out of this hole."

bjmv73,NTA. He seems like an incredibly sensitive person which will probably have a great deal of trouble in life handling people who don't abide by his special exessive personal privileges.

bjnf4w,"YWBTA- IF you decide not to tell him, I can tell you right now if he finds out somehow on his own later on he will have suspicions that you didn't tell him because you might still have feelings for him, relationships are based on trust and that will indubitably cause trust issues between the two of you."
bjnijf,NTA-your house your rules period.
bjnlyg,"ESH

No offense but two bass players could be a bit weird and you're kinda horning in on his territory. Feel free to learn the bass but if what kinds of pieces do you expect to play able to play with two basses? Also assuming you can in two months get as good as someone who has been playing cor years is a bit rude to him and his skills (unless he's really not that good or you are an incredible musician, both of which are possible, but it's still a bit presumptuous).

However he can't just decide for you and unilaterally kick you out of the group. And his reasons aren't that nice either.

The nest solution is to decide on music and see what kinds of things you will be able to play with the players/instruments you have. Maybe you could compromise and play one song with bass, one with violin?"
bjno9x,"NTA

You were distracted and he took it wayyy too personally like you *intended* to close the door on him. Geez that's a bit self-absorbed of him."
bjnson,"NTA, but you kinda do suck because you decided to kinda rub their face in it it seems. But in the end it's your account and you're just being nice enough to let them use it."

bjo40k,"NAH if accidental pregnancy.

You two had discussed children at the start of the relationship and the agreement was no children until older and established careers/resources. That is the ideal case.

However, it was never discussed what would be done if a pregnancy took place before you both were older. That allows both of you off the hook in case of an accident like this one. 


You don't want to make the sacrifices necessary, and you're within your right. She doesn't want to abort, and she's within her right. 

She's the ass if she planned this pregnancy."
bjo4rc,YTA - you became one the minute you sent the email.  There's plenty of things you can do / give / say to celebrate their special days without spending much money and you could do that without ever announcing the fact to them.  You only sent the email to rub it in their faces how you were going to get back at them for punishing you for breaking a rule you clearly knew about and they enforced by enacting a consequence you didn't like.

bjod1m,"ESH - Not for deciding not to drive her, but for how you handled it.  While I get your point about the $20, basically saying that she should pay you in order to pick the music just makes you come off as a petty. So agree with your decision, just not how you went about it."
bjoddh,YTA. Nobody wants bedbugs but you won't get them eating with your mom because she goes to church with someone who has them. You're being illogical.

bjoxap,NTA- you can only bail her out so many times before you become an enabler.
bjozhb,"NTA. While you blocking him could've resolved the issue sooner this guy is still fully responsible for harassing you. It's also highly inappropriate for him to use a customer database as his own personal dating agency (in most places there's very strict laws about this and I definitely think he broke some). 

Don't feel bad about trying to get him fired. Feel good about that you tried to stop him from doing this to other people."
bjp7tn,YTA because you’re talking about pics but not sharing. Duh.
bjpdlc,"NAH

But if he doesn't want to go into a home, why don't you look into finding him someone who will spend time with him? There are plenty of volunteer services where people come to the house for free and just hang out with elderly people so they don't spend so much time alone."

bjpr10,"ESH, mostly because I think you guys should have just been upfront and honest with him before you hit your breaking point. But his behavior also sounds super annoying and frustrating, so he's not free of fault either. Still, you can't expect him to fix a problem he doesn't know exists."

Taking care of an senior dog is a lot of money, and a huge commitment for a reason. But it's cruel to put them down before their time because they become a little bit more inconvenient.

It kind of sounds like your husband’s sister is taking advantage of her brother....Is she being proportionately compensated for the administrative and advertising work she is doing, relative to the actual work (professional electrician jobs) that your husband is responsible for? It could be that she recognizes that the value that she adds to the “business”, so to speak, is basically entry-level, and what your husband is adding required years of professional training. Maybe she doesn’t want competition with you on control over the administrative portions? Maybe she doesn’t want someone else evaluating the money flow in this side business? Not saying that her contribution isn’t important, but I’d just check in with your husband in terms of understanding what her motivations might be in wanting to start this side business."

He wanted a kid so bad, it’s his responsibility to explain to her the circumstances of her birth. He’s got a voice and a memory doesn’t he? Then why does he need your help.

Even though your family doesn’t support you, know that countless strangers on the Internet - including me - do."
bjtfng,NTA. She’s being lazy.
bjthw1,"YTA, not for being unable to change your aunt's mind, but because you don't seem to understand that this is a *wild animal*. It's lived outdoors all its life. It doesn't want to be cooped up in some cage in your aunt's house.

>My aunt put the bird in a cage and they will be buying food for the bird. They had already prepared water inside the cage, and I also argued that some pet owners who don't have experience in taking care of animals buy them anyway.

Again, this isn't a domesticated animal and it's unfair to make it one. That bird is going to be miserable until the day it dies, which could be sooner rather than later since your aunt also doesn't seem to understand you don't go around capturing wild animals to make as pets."
bjtkaw," Yeah, nah, NTA. If he is precious about it just shout him a few sneakys alone on the weekend."
bjtkdk,"NTA. Easier said than done, but try not to feel guilty. None of it was your responsibility.

If you feel like someone needs to know, maybe you could have a conversation with your mum. I would definitely leave your dad in the dark, though."
bjtkf5,"NTA the law is the law, and no one, no matter how mentally ill, is above it."
bjtotc,"ESH. Her for cheating and lying. You for snooping and continuing to snoop after you broke up. Let sleeping dogs lie. You will gain nothing from continuing to snoop, except every time you do, you become more of an asshole. It's common to want to know what/who to blame for a breakup, but it gets you nowhere. Move on, assume everything was a lie, and maybe learn a lesson about being too trusting so early on in a relationship. Maybe learn a lesson about not moving in together so quickly next go around. Breakups are hard, but they teach you about yourself and about others. You'll feel better eventually."
bjtr5g,"YTA

That isn't ""solid proof"". If you can't trust him, just break up and move on. There's no need to randomly destroy friendships."
bjtueb,"YTA, but I don't think you're malicious.

It's just that this was probably the worst setting you could have made a comment (abused women regularly passing through the building who probably don't want *any* male attention right now).

Not only that, but as a woman, ""you smell nice"" from a random stranger is kinda creepy regardless of the environment."
bjtypu,NTA - however you are already showing signs of how damaging this is internally to you. Fuck the money and get out of there. If you want on your exit interview discuss that this has been a reason that you’re leaving. This does not need to be the hill you die on.
bju1kw,"NTA

You are running a business, not a social service.  It is admirable that you will retain and reward the good workers.  

Actually imho, you have more of an obligation to the success of the business than to the (poor)choices of (poor) employees."
bju63m,NTA. It's not your responsibility to change your diet for him as he needs to figure out how to self-regulate on his own.
bju6w5,"NTA, that's normal to lock your house up and belongings. What town is this? Because I'm pretty sure criminals would looooove to visit"
bju8j0,"NAH. You don't have to make them if you don't want, and he has a right to observe his dietary rules in his home. It is weird to me that you would pick this hill to die on, though--making them with chicken is no more work."
bju9cp,"NTA

You don’t owe her anything. If you prefer not to speak to her, that’s your right."
bju9ht,"YTA. She probably thinks that this is something she can commit to long term. You should really tell her, if for no oyther reason than to give yourself street cred for your next relationship"
bjubde,"I guess NTA, but you have to understand that people don't send those stupid messages because of you. They send them because they have their own shit going on in their lives. Like, that guy could have been going through a depressive episode too, and while shit talking strangers on the internet, and venting his anger toward ""society"" may not be the answer for him, it may provide temporary release fore whatever he's feeling. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that the same applies to you. I don't think it ruined anyone's day, but it was pointless, and speaks to a greater need for you to learn some better coping skills, especially if you're reacting like this to a petty, year old comment."
bjuexq,NAH - but that is odd. A family you never interact with and you gave the teen girl a gift? That is weird.
bjuggd,"NTA: Your reasons are pretty damn valid.  Height is [pretty damn important in our society still](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug04/standing), even though it shouldn't be as physical prowess is less and less important. 

Also I used NTA bc if your wife really is implying:

>insinuates that I wouldn't be supportive of our baby or love it less if it was a boy

Then that is fuckkkkked up.  She asked you a question and you gave a genuine, thought out response."
bjuizk,NTA and tell her to go fuck herself.  She had a year to politely ask for them back. Too bad.
bjuj7v,"YTA, you definitely need to understand that sex isn’t just defined PIV. Not to be graphic but if you perform oral do you not consider that sex? Because it is. Lesbians use dildos and they consider it sex. What you are doing is discrediting her and her intimacy with you. That’s why she is upset."
bjuki4,"Obviously NTA.

Reddit has taught me that people have weird views on religion. There's absolutely no reason to feel guilty because you don't share someone's opinion on their religion - even if they are your parents."
bjupko,"NTA - Don't jeopardize your good standing.  Just tell her you'll pass her application along and see what you can do,  then just drop it."
bjusju,"NTA! That isn't fair. You put in all the labor and his friends get the benefit. While I think it's healthy to have some seperate hobbies, you should have *some* together hobbies."
bjutn1,"NAH. You were just being honest. 

I’ve been in a similar situation, what seems to make everyone feel the best is take them, hold on to them for a while, (they can just stay in the suitcase) then donate them after a while. Maybe wait a few years. 

I live a very minimal lifestyle so when I’m guilted into taking grandparent’s furniture and other possessions this is what I usually do."
bjuvet,"NTA, do what is best for yourself! It sucks your family acts like this but you can either invite your parents to keep your family or just love them all from afar."
bjv28w,"NTA, they could have looked into what you need if they were gonna get you a practical gift."
bjv2zb,"NTA, at least I don’t think.

“If you do this, you will no longer work here”

*does it anyway* 

Management: You no longer work here  

Her: :O"
bjv5yv,NTA. It’s your house and you have a perfectly good reason for not wanting her to bring her dog.
bjv71v,"NTA

It's totally acceptable to call out inappropriate comments/behaviour. You and your partner should be on the same page regarding how to respond and you should be on guard against gaslighting from your partner's gem of a father. 

Keep your cool whenever possible. Stand your ground. Be an example of how to act. And avoid being overly preachy. You're in the right."
bjv909,"NTA

The aunt has plenty of time with the baby from the sounds of it and you have a right to privacy and alone time. Your phrase of treating her like her own daughter though gives me pause with some of her actions- is there any chance that she would try and retaliate if you limit her time or when you move out?"
bjvche,"YTA ""I have the personality where I tend to tell the unfiltered truth"".  

That's the personality of an asshole."
bjvicf,"NTA - Anytime a teenager disagrees with strict baptist parents, an angel smokes a bowl. Might as well die then mama, your beliefs are insane. People HAVE to believe what you believe, or your life is over? C'mon... she's the selfish asshole here."
bjvje8,NTA - It's a risk you take when you don't know the person. But I'd be annoyed.
bjvom6,"NTA - Fuck Mary, Fuck Mike. Sorry youve had to deal with this but you don't need people like Mary in your life."
bjvqy5,"YTA. 

But, you need to be that asshole. Being an asshole here will likely help her, while still risking your friendship. 

Make sure to frame it as you are worried for her grades, and not you don't like her spending time with her bf."
bjvru5,"ESH. I strongly recommend premarital counseling for you two to work on your communication. I get that you're (justifiably) sick of her disregarding your opinions, but throwing a tantrum and refusing to try to help at all is NOT going to fix things - hence everyone sucking here. You need to have a serious discussion if you are unhappy with these dynamics, or nothing will change, and your resentment will grow. Address this before the wedding, or don't get married."
bjvytu,"Nta. Because I’m a petty jerk, I wouldn’t go at all. She can send the shower invite where she’ll get presents directly to you, but the wedding invite goes to someone else? Your husband isn’t invited? I could see if he was a new boyfriend, but a husband? She doesn’t seem too invested in actually having you there."
bjw1i5,"NAH.  Your feelings are valid.  That said, don't cut ties.  You may regret it.  I lost my brother almost 19 years ago.  At the time of his death, he and our mother were not speaking.  She regrets this and has never really recovered.  Keep making the effort and one day, he may come out of his depression and be able to continue the relationship."
bjw3f4,"NAH

it was fine for them to request, and it's fine for you to deny as it would clearly be an imposition. 

they become an asshole if they pressure you or make you feel guilty. 

you don't even need to give them an explanation."
bjw8cd,"NTA.

but you have to stop stringing your aunt along.

tell them that you are feeling pressured and it's making you uncomfortable and you aren't going to donate your hair. 

it was completely inappropriate of your mom to donate your hair for you in the presence of the aunt."
bjw9lj,"I love the idea that you think it's necessary for people to put a sign up to let others know they don't want literal shit on there property. You'd think it would be a given that putting shit on other people's things was wrong and unwanted. Does the sign need to specify which types of poop are unwelcome? Like if the sign said, ""don't let your dog poop here"", would it be okay to have a cat poop in their yard?"
bjwcbf,NTA
bjwcyv,"NTA.

>They say that bugs in food is something that can happen at any place

No....the FDA would disagree.

Pages like Yelp exist for a reason."
bjwczg,NTA your friend sounds like she wanted some spa time instead of actually supporting you.
bjwdx0,NTA.  You've worked hard and deserve the life you want.  If they care that much they could move closer.  I wish they weren't making you feel guilty for this. You don't deserve that.
bjwg0n,"NTA

Kissing other people while in a relationship is cheating."

bjwquu,"YTA.

Who wants to take an 18 month old camping? Not me. You're being weird."
bjwsb2,"NTA. You did everything you could and the “you should have stayed even though she told you not to” is a shitty excuse for poor communication. 

It’s nobody’s job to waste time trying to figure out when exactly someone is saying the opposite of what they mean. It’s weird, it’s kind of rude, and it gets nothing done. 

She’s not going to be a good roommate going forward if she has such severe communication issues like this."
bjwwbt,"NTA - Your house, your rules. Depending on where you live, she’s underage anyways."
bjwx56,"ESH:

That guy definitely deserved to get arrested, but...yeah, bad move doing the stuff you did with young kids in the car."

i would encourage her to get therapy though."
bjx10x,"NAH

bjx44g,"YTA. 

No one should have religion forced upon them. There is nothing wrong with respectfully sitting quietly while others say Grace and everyone starting the meal together."
bjx485,"NAH, you offering your home is very generous but you're not obligated to spend every second with them. I've been on both sides of this: my friends came down and stayed at mine, I was with them for couple of small trips, but mostly working. Also visited a friend in norway, he took me to sweden and bergen but most of the time (2 other weeks) I spent coming and going alone."
bjx4rr,Clearly NTA - she sounds grim
bjx5du,"Holy shit **NTA**. That's not a ""leave it in the past"" situation. A ""leave it in the past"" situation is if this guy dented your car and didn't leave a note. This is a ""fuck this guy forever"" situation. Your boyfriend can't just ask you to forget about the fact that when you were raped you turned to your friends for support and one of them told everyone you were a liar.

You have every right in the world to hold a grudge. Frankly you have every right in the world to tell your boyfriend that he needs to choose between you and C right damn now because you're not going to continue dating someone who wants to be friends with someone who treated you that way. For what it's worth I'm very sorry that you had to deal with that on top of the trauma, I hope you're in a better place now."
bjx5rm,"YTA BIG TIME!!! She told you she didn't want you to attend this event because you embarrassed her last year, so you lie about it and go anyway?!?! Is there any possible interpretation of these facts that allows you to believe you are not the asshole?!?! Because I honestly don't see how that is possible in any way, shape or form."
bjx8fw,NTA. Everyone agreed on the plan. Now she's going back on it and acting like a child.
bjx93b,"ESH- sit down and talk with your brother about how it is impacting your relationship with your daughter. to ask him to stop giving to her, after he's helped you for so long, seems rude and ungrateful. maybe if you not so subtly tell him how this is effecting you personally, he will be able to understand. 

he sucks because telling his **niece** he will marry her when she turns 18 is wrong on so many levels.

OP, don't bite the hand that's fed you and your daughter for so long. don't hurt your brother or make him feel bad for what he's done. just talk with him."
bjxdax,">She just picks at me though, pointing out my various faults and flaws, magnifying them and trying to get me to flip first

NTA Your mother is goading you into taking the bait and then after bombarding you with further verbal abuse, storms off and immediately plays the victim in order to get you to apologize.

You are not required to endure this manner of bullshit just because you are related. Family are just as capable of being shitty to you as strangers, friends, etc. Once you move out, cut her off, you'll clearly be healthier without her. If she complains, politely bring up the fact that she's constantly been shitty to you. If she's willing to change, extend an olive branch. If not, hang up the phone and keep it moving. What do you have to lose?

Edit: grammar"
bjxgq7,NTA. He needs to learn to be responsible with his money and it’s not you or your family’s job to save him if he doesn’t follow through on that.
bjxij5,"YTA. Your girlfriend is helping her friend in an emergency, it's not like she's cancelling your date just to go hang out with her. You know you could go help as well instead of posting about it on Reddit."
bjxjdr,"NAH. This is a very sensitive subject, obviously. 

Everybody has a mourning period, and you're under no obligation to mourn when yours has passed. 

Your mom has obviously carried this with her her whole life since the event. It seems to me that she still wants all of you, including your sister, to come together as a family. I think your presence means a lot to her because it allows her to have some of the family back together again for a little while. 

Obviously this is a huge emotional burden on you and I understand that. It's like inflicting fresh hurt on you because you're not in mourning anymore except the pain of seeing your mother so heartbroken. 

Maybe you can gently explain some of this to get and explain to her that that level of emotion is very uncomfortable and difficult to you. 

You might even gently suggest that there are other ways you can remember and honor your sister in a positive way. Go to the memorial and speak with her. Write her letters and leave pictures of what's going on in your life. Ask your mom to tell you stories of how she lives. Play games there with your mom that she would have loved. 

I'm sure a child lost at such a young age would not have wanted her family to be so distressed all the time. I think you can hold on to her memory and spirit without ""mourning"" in the current sense. And it would probably mean a lot to your mom if you suggested your own method of honoring her that is more appropriate to the emotions you are feeling. Maybe then she would not be afraid that you are letting your sister fade away, but that you're taking positive control of your emotions in your own way. 

Just my thoughts"
bjxjx1,"NTA, this is probably why the first couple bailed."
bjxmiz,"NTA.

You were told you are not welcome while you have a baby. You have a baby."
bjxowk,"NTA. You tried to leave gracefully, you presented a reason (although you didn't have to!) why you weren't interested in participating and only after the activist persisted did you tell him off. 

I'm not a veterinarian, but I work in the veterinary field and at least a few times a month a client asks me if I eat meat or animal products, obviously spoiling to gatekeep animal welfare if my answer is yes. I tell them I prefer not to discuss my diet except with my doctor. I respect veganism, but a lot of actual vegans go out of their way to demonstrate that they won't offer that same respect vegetarians or omnivores."
bjxtpt,YTA  - who ever had to process your payment didn't give you the ticket.
bjxydw,"Eh, I think NTA but kind of leaning towards everyone sucks. I'd be annoyed too if there were loud parties happening during finals period, but:

\- you have your own apartment that you could study in. Put some headphones/earplugs on if your roommates are too loud, or talk to them about keeping it down.

\- if your gf lives in a college dorm, I assume that means she's on campus. Are there no common study spaces? A college library?

No point in wasting your energy and mental space being pissed off at the people throwing the party and trying to get them to cancel (which seems unlikely)."
bjy0rn,"YTA and mostly because of this comment:

> ""you alright? you look like a depressed person""

You already suspect he's depressed and then you say that to him? Very insensitive and rude. 

Other than that yeah you'd also be the asshole. It seems like he's doing a lot of stuff that you disagree with but is not against policy, so that's nothing you could even snitch about. The fact that he works less could potentially be something you could bring up but how about talking to the guy himself first about this instead of immediately going to the supervisors? 

Honestly you sound like a busy body that's way too judgmental about other people but doesn't even want to try to help them, just judge them."
bjy4pd,"NTA - I don't understand why families feel the need to criticize when someone says no to being a groomsman or bridesmaid. It's a question with which each persons answer may vary, not a requirement just because you were asked."
bjy4qm,"NAH. 

it's reasonable for them to ask and see if you are interested in switching but you are not obligated to switch. Its literally your room.  If they get angry at you not switching then I change my vote to Not the asshole.

Also you're not the reason people can't sleep. The snoring is. There are other options the snoring roommate can try like those strips or getting a mouth guard (it worked for my dad. Supposedly it keeps you lower jaw from slacking backwards so you are less likely to snore). 

Don't switch if you don't want to.

Edit: I originally said Not the asshole. Im changing to NAH assuming the roomies dont make a stink out of this. I don't think it's bad to see if OP would have an interest in switching"
bjy4yr,"YTA if you don’t get him some type of activity as his gift. He wants to spend time together, so plan something for you to do together, and give him a card. Just not doing anything sucks."
bjy88u,Yo dude you lost?
bjyav0,"ESH.

&#x200B;

This has office politics written all over it. You are basically developing an automated system to do what they are now doing manually? Effectively putting them out of work? And to do this you are breaking into their password protected files and ""stealing"" their code?

&#x200B;

Cover Your Ass. If this is what you need to do to do your work get it in writing/email from your manager that you are not breaking company policy by doing this and he has your back."
bjyb4y,"NAH: They have every right to terminate you if you are violating their policy, even if there appears to be some kind of unofficial agreement... But then again, it must not even be an unofficial agreement if they keep scheduling you knowing you can't make it at x time?

But you're more than welcome to be confident in your abilities and state you have options."
bjyevi,"YTA. My gf has a friends group and they are all close. One of those friends is married but has a similar type of relationship with a gym friend. Let me tell you this, every single one of the other girls in the friends group thinks it's fucked up and she's crossing a line and judges her for it, just not directly to her face.

Fucking seriously?

Your SO gets some flak for going through your phone like that but come on..."
bjyjny,"NTA - your friend isn't your doctor nor your counselor.   


If your friend is concerned about your drug use, they could've been more tactful in bringing that up to you. It sounds more like your friend is the one with issues if she's regularly thinking ""other friend are on drugs or addicted as well"""
bjyn0w,Ask her if she still wants to be a bridesmaid. You might not have to kick her out.

bjz3sj,"NTA. You can't light yourself on fire to keep other people warm. You tried being a good friend to him and seemed conscious of your actions and any mistakes or lines you might have overstepped. That's all you can really do in friendships. It's pretty obvious he didn't appreciate it and at the end of the day, you don't deserve to be doing your best while be treated like you aren't trying at all."
bjz40o,"NTA. It seems your manager needs to step in and take a more direct role in handling this. One way to go about it is have your coworker route all of her requests for coverage through your manager. That will hopefully increase her threshold to request time off, and will make her unprofessional behavior your manager’s problem instead of your problem."
bjz5kq,"I’d say ESH 
The whole situation sucks but you could’ve tried to get her attention. Maybe you could also try to learn some signs or at least the alphabet (I’m fluent in American SL) so I know the kind of “dedication” this won’t happen again. Especially if you’re working with deaf people. Basic signs would save you a lot of trouble. But the food people could’ve brought a couple options over to her as well."
bjz8ey,"NTA, you're entitled to your own opinion, nor are you ungrateful for not agreeing with them. 

Frankly insane that your own political beliefs might have some terrible ramifications. I assume your family is from some dictator state.

the only thing you can say about older people is that they have lived longer than you without dying. there is no wisdom that inherently comes with age"
bjzc1z,YTA women are capable of managing and living through their own periods. if she said she still wanted to and COULD go then you shouldn't have lied to keep her from attending. what an undermining thing to do.

bk0bnr,"NTA. TBH, I would put all of his shit unwashed in a box and leave it outside. You will keep being a doormat if he continues to do this.

bk0i8m,"NAH, and it sucks that there isn't an asshole here. Your wedding is not at odds with another person's wedding. There is no competition. Expect your family and friends to be happy for you, and leave it at that. If you put anything more into it, you are only setting yourself up for disappointment.

Let me say, as someone who is having a wedding in just a few months, weddings are crazy expensive. Maybe use this as an opportunity to have a small ceremony with only your closest friends and family, then, if you want to later on, hold a blow-out reception for everyone.

Of course, if the date is such a big deal to you, the tenth anniversary is probably more meaningful than the ninth."
bk0in5,"NTA. There’s no reason he should be there when she’s not, especially considering the history. He shouldn’t be cooking with your food. It’s your space, too. Your suggestion of them spending more time at his place is both reasonable and called for."

My mom has BPD (borderline personality disorder) and from what I understand usually this disorder comes about because of family trauma. Sort of sounds like from what you’ve described here, she reminds me of my mother... maybe to read some stuff on r/raisedbyborderlines and if it all sounds very very familiar... you might want to take some other precautions here, in terms of what you can expect from your mom and what to do to navigate this mess. 

You’re not the asshole for not wanting to be your moms personal counselor/therapist and you absolutely deserve to be happy- regardless of how the fuck your mom feels. Stand up for yourself. You deserve to be respected."
bk112q,Why not just add a mandatory gratuity charge?
bk14jy,"NTA. 
You are entitled to leave a job whenever you want and for whatever reason, and a managers incompetence is a good reason to go."
bk16m8,"NTA for blocking people on social media.  social media is the devil because it propagates drama like this. 

that said, seems a bit asshole-ish to also block your sister out of your life completely with an ultimatum that she apologize first."
bk16x0,"YTA if you spring it on her. If she’s being respectful then at least give her some time. Tell her that your mom has an issue with it and ask if she can stay with the other person, but give her at least a week to figure shit out. You can’t agree to let someone crash with you for three weeks and then kick them out with no warning. 

Also INFO: how old are you? Why was she kicked out of her parents’ place?

Edited to add: why do you feel like you have to entertain her or watch her constantly? She’s staying with you for a place to live, not to steal your shit or be entertained by you. This honestly just makes you sound selfish."
bk19hw,"NAH. I just lost my own great-grandmother to Alzheimer's, AND I started my career in medicine working as a nurse in a dementia ward. I KNOW how painful it is to see a loved one like that, to have them look at you and not even recognize you (even worse, seeing them recognize you just enough that they struggle to place you but simply can't, ugh). On the other hand, even if it's painful, Alzheimer's patients do still have some modicum of self-awareness. He might not be able to express it, but he may still have moments clear enough to recognize you--or if not recognize you then at least realize that someone he loves is visiting him. I'd hate for you to miss out on what could be some of the last possible moments to catch even just a glimpse of your grandfather-- and to let him know that he has someone who loves him, so I understand the rest of your family's concerns as well."

bk1q4o,"it was going to be “not the asshole” until you said the condescending thing about how he should be able to go a couple of hours without looking at his phone. 

He’s a father of a child with developmental issues. He is eternally on-call, and you’re selfish to imply he’s somehow acting in the wrong to check his phone. 

ESH - he needs to learn etiquette by stepping outside of the theater. You need to accept that your friend has a family with problems and stop expecting him to go hours without checking on them."

You cant be ""friends with benefits"" if you're sure the other party wants a relationship. It's no longer friends with benefits at that point. It's a ""girl looking for relationship with a friend who only wants added benefits "". Kinda rude."
bk20ih,"YTA. You're gating quality people based on their enthusiasm as you perceive it for your company which appears to be quite unknown.

I hate be a hiring manager in any company that pushes hard for people who are their niche clients. I worked for a company big on cycling culture, they missed out on great engineers because they didn't cycle. Put that aside. If a candidate is there, they are interested. Your colleague is right, it's your job to spark and keep their interest, and sell the company culture to the candidate."

bk2bnx,"NAH. 

It’s fine that you looked him up but it’s kinda strange you kept bringing things up with him about his outside of school life, and it was only made more awkward by his having to tell you to stop. It’s okay to google teachers but going this in depth is pretty abnormal in my own opinion. If you care, I would advise you not to bring any of this up again ‘cause it would just make things weird."

bk2d8z,"NTA. I wouldn't call the police without knowing for sure, but you should file a report with your area's child protective services. They'll do a random home visit and if they see any drugs they'll take appropriate measures to make sure the child is safe."
bk2dpj,Esh-this kind of advice is above reddit's pay grade. I suggest some advice from a professional counselor.
bk2f5d,"NAH - firstly there’s a lot of personal identifying info here which you might want to consider editing. 

He’s pursuing his dreams but it shouldn’t come at your expense. It sounds as if you are starting to resent him anyway so it’s best to get this out in the open. 

By the sounds of things you’re not asking him to give it up entirely, and that should be made clear. There’s nothing wrong with trying to improve your situation."
bk2iu3,"NAH. If she was in a car accident, I understand why she would share pictures and tell people. It's a big event for some people and they want to talk about it and share it, even casually.   


I would have said YTA if it was her car, but it sounds like you were driving and you're anxious on how this reflects on your driving. That's pretty understandable too, and I get why you're uncomfortable. Simply telling her you're uncomfortable and asking her to stop because of that isn't an asshole thing to communicate."
bk2n78,NAH - You did what you could. He clearly didn't want to talk about it.

bk32y6,"NTA 

I would totally decline being the best man (say you just cant swing it with family obligations), but I think I’d go to the wedding. Skipping it is burning a bridge that can probably never be rebuilt. Plus,if his bride is this awful, maybe the marriage won’t last. In that case, you won’t have the missed wedding as a stumbling block in repairing your relationship with your brother."

You bought communal supplies. Whether or not you notified him before purchasing them, by using them, he made himself responsible for part of the cost.

I don't think she was trying to learn about her race - she was just trying to express her challenges as a biracial person missing out on her mother's heritage. What you should have done is encouraged her to learn more about *real* Mexican culture, but not calling her racist as she obviously wasn't trying to actually study the culture of Mexico, but simply demonstrate her emotions. However, she definitely should've tried to learn at least a little Mexican culture before making a presentation like that."
bk3fx4,"Congrats, you've discovered a source of conflict before marriage.

Work through this together like adults.  If you can't do it on your own, get some couples therapy, which is a good idea even if your aren't struggling pre marriage.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
bk3xws,"NTA.  It would be kind to give her 2 weeks or 4 weeks to find a place, and let her know that you won't let her stay past that.  

At this point she's abusing your generosity, and your need to stick up for yourself."
bk3zfr,"NTA, but mostly because he bragged about it. Really though, if this happens again with anyone (it will), inform them first that you're not happy with their performance and if they don't get better you're taking it up with the teacher. Then if they don't get better, take it up with the teacher."
bk40jp,"NTA your game night has been set for a long time you should have to change that. 

However, I would highly suggest you take a night at least once a month to meet up with him at his place, bring a 6 pack, maybe some leftovers from your fridge and some snack and just shoot the shit with him, maybe even bring some fun board games, Catan, 5 minute dungeon, etc. Sounds like this guy really needs you and your buddies. He does need to get his shit together, but losing his friends completely may not be the kick in the ass he needs. Encourage him in the best ways to get his life together and be harsh here and there if you feel he needs it. But if you truly love this guy's friendship, be there for him and help him get where he needs to go (unless it becomes toxic to you, then you need to drop him)"
bk40s0,"NTA,  I don't think anyone should expect you to do any more than notify the authorities.  Anecdotal but one time I pulled over for a couple broken down on the side of the road.  Turns out it was bait and they tried to rob me.  I don't stop for people I don't know anymore."
bk40ug,"NTA for wanting an apology from the kid, but from the dad might be a bit too far, he's just going off the information falsely provided by the kid and it's not like he yelled at you without confirming or something. But yeah, requesting an apology from the kid isn't unreasonable, but not sure if you'll get it, it is a kid after all."
bk41w8,"NTA. Something similar happened to me when I took the SAT back in the mid 1980’s.  At the time I was more interested in substance abuse than academics so nobody, including me, expected much.  I pretty much just took it because everyone else was.  I ended up with a 1320, which turned out to be the best score in my tiny little rural school. The so called smart kids were genuinely pissed off. But I wasn’t going around bragging about it.  I told someone because they asked, and pretty soon everyone knew.  Even some of my teachers were annoyed."
bk422j,Wow. You’re mom is TA.  She should stick a sock in it and go pick up your Dad just this once.  You only have one graduation.
bk42po,"NTA.  Semester is ending, find other roommates."
bk44k4,NTA - they say they're owed netflix because you shared dinner with her in the past? They're deluded.
bk47ba,"NAH.

It's sad, people are hurting, and people made mistakes trying to look out for each other.

Don't hold this mistake against your mom, it was the wing decision, but made with the best intentions.

You shouldn't have said you'd never forgive her, but I'm not surprised you felt like that at the time.  I would apologize to her.

I'm sorry for your loss."
bk4a5w,NTA if it's clothing that's appropriate in other public areas like the gym. She's being insecure. She needs to get over it.
bk4abd,"NTA for rejecting MLM snakeoil.

Unless you do it disrespectfully.

But you have to tell her you're not going to use it, as you don't want her buying more for you."
bk4cyk,"YTS for ""sucker""

bk4xwu,"NTA. Not your project, not your problem. You still did a lot."
bk54ud,"NAH - I understand wanting some silence. It would be annoying if she were watching netflix out loud on a personal laptop, but if she’s just scrolling briefly online and it makes a noise, it seems excessive to pull out headphones. You could also go to your room. My apartment is the exact same layout and the common area is typically accepted as noisier, where people chat, watch TV, and cook, whereas your bedroom is meant to be quieter (studying, sleeping). I mean, she pays to be in the living room too."
bk5b03,"NTA, not my place to judge but the impression I get is that his precious guns are more important to him than your family's success and financial security."
bk5bd1,"YTA if your not religious why would you care about someone else’s option on the topic even if you do go to a catholic school 

Secondly yes it is very odd for a Jew to be going to a catholic school but did you consider that she probably doesn’t have a say in the matter ??

And yeah clearly she made a stupid comment that was probably a cry for attention but why go out of your way to call someone out on a topic you “don’t give a crap about”

Lastly technically if you phrased your replay the way you said  you did you’d be saying that everyone in the class agrees with her POV not that no one cares about her point of view"
bk5idz,ESH if you let him stay you’d be allowing more problems to enter the relationship. And he shouldn’t go back to an ex for comfort. Remember he’s an ex for a reason.
bk5jo9,"NTA, but you were kinda being gullible (borderline dumb) for believing that. Especially with that information not being directly from the hotel. Try to get a refund, doubt it will work though."
bk5lhm,"NTA. She's your EX. He's your child. The thing She's really mad about, is that she didn't stick with you long enough to get a BMW."

bk5md0,"YTA look he's black and wants to support black people. Sometimes women want to support women, gay people want to support gay people etc. 

There's no need to call him racist for wanting to support his fellow black people."
bk5rrc,"NTA.

You didn't ditch him. Ditching implies you had plans with him and you flaked to go to a party, or that he wanted to go and you didn't bring him with you. What happened here was that there was a party you wanted to go to, he could have gone with you, but he didn't want to go and for some reason he thought that meant that you weren't allowed to go.

You didn't do anything wrong. Your boyfriend is a controlling, immature jerk."
bk5zjl,"Nta
Yummy, emotional manipulation. Shes the parent you're the child.  Shes being selfish."
bk60jy,"Hmmm, I think YWBTA. And just know I'm saying this as an openly gay man. Like you said, you can wait until your grandparents move out to inform them of it, and not cause a bunch of issues in a household you are no longer a part of. Your parents accept you, and if they are loving and supportive parents I think you can do them this favor. Of course, your bigoted grandparents are the bigger asholes in this situation. Would you be able to bring your boyfriend as a ""friend"" by simply stating he's a close friend who had no family to go to for Christmas? This way you still bring him and get to see him but there is no issue with the grandparents

 As per your last comment, I still live with my parents who have a very different political viewpoint. Keeling my head down involves isolating myself in my room or never being home, as my father cant go 20 minutes without being up politics. I hear your parents may be in a similar situation, but as they have kids and responsibilities and are in their own home they shouldn't be expected to keep their heads down."

bk6cmk,"YTA, for continuing after she said she didn’t care. You can find almost anyone’s address on the internet."
bk6g3a,"YTA - just because you pay all the bills doesn’t give you the right to treat your GF like garbage.  If she’s been alone all day at home, she will be keen on human contact."
bk6gxm,"""You'll try to ask""?  This is about money.  You don't try to ask.  You sit down and say, ""you're using more than you are paying for""  Cough up more money or find a new place to live."
bk6vf6,"ESH this just sounds like you’re all immature, which makes sense."
bk6vmx,"NAH but your girlfriend is probably looking at you and re-evaluating you as someone who is not a good longterm prospect.  You are bad with money, make stupid and insanely expensive impulse buys of ridiculous items and money is one of the top 3 dealbreakers in a relationship.  

Blowing huge wads of cash doesn't make someone happy and if you think a car is what it takes to make you happy, she's probably thinking, long term,  you aren't a good catch.  And she's right.  You aren't.  

So nobody's an asshole. You just aren't compatible."
bk72t9,"You’re NTA. You don’t have to forgive her because your mom does. 

Now, your mom is dying. You can pretend to play nice or not share your plans to not forgive with your mom, as that isn’t information that will help her at this stage. Just love on your mom.

Your aunt is a wretched person."
bk763q,YTA. Not a big one - you are the wrong one here tho. I understand you don’t want to make a scene but at least say good bye to the host.
bk78ah,"NAH  First, you didn't hear anything and they wouldn't tell you what was said.  How do you even know anything bad was said?  Maybe there is history between these people that you don't know about and they are trying to get them in trouble.  Now, this may be far fetched, but it proves my point--you don't know anything about anything in this situation.  Therefore you shouldn't be running around trying to kick people out based just on what someone else said (and they won't repeat).  As for customer service make sure everyone feels comfortable and do what you can to make that happen."
bk7bdy,"YTA. I was on the fence for a long time, but ultimately, I think you were in the wrong. Her sickness sounds serious, and she was counting on you to be there for her. She needed you. Instead, you left her to see a friend. For 8 hours. And your answer when she confronted you about this today...

>I told her that I should be able to see my friends whenever I want to without having to feel guilt.

...was wrong as well. You know very well that seeing your friends isn't what she was upset about. No wonder she was hurt when you told her that. 

I suggest you make a good plan for an apology."
bk7ksq,"ESH  
what she does reflects on her character, but what you choose to do reflects on yours.   


HOWEVER, since its only one month, im sure no one would blame you if you continued to not tell her. ;)"
bk7mw3,"NAH

The motorcyclist certainly isn't an asshole for...existing?  TBH I have canceled ubers when the dude made me uncomfortable so whatever reason you have you're well within your rights to not want a female driver when you will be that close.  I don't think it makes you a sexist and I have a pretty low threshold to pull the sexist trigger,

I guess your friend is kinda TA here for calling you a sexist in a circumstance when if the roles were reversed it would be understood a woman wasn't be sexist for refusing a male driver."
bk7nrf,"ESH. I do think it's a problem that you allow your unleashed dog to go on your neighbors property, no matter how old or well behaved the dog is. I don't blame your neighbor's dog if the aggression happens when you bring your dog on their property unannounced. The dogs fighting with your dogs on public space is a problem. I'd let your neighbors know before talking to the condo board, but by all means do that about the public aggression."
bk7nw3,"NAH - your parents tried their best. But I know that it is hard when that best was inadequate. 

I had speech therapy as a child and again as a teenager. It’s not some silver bullet that makes you speak clearer or more understandably. I still stumble over words, there are certain words I can’t say, and people still occasionally ask me to repeat myself. But I’m still happy with how everything turned out. I’m also a pretty good thesaurus."
bk7om7,NTA. Tell him to take a bath.
bk7tlv,"NTA - If you want people to have the most likelihood of coming, you don't give them the plans last minute. I would watch the finale personally but I have a feeling your family will be angry with you for it. If that's something your okay with then by all means, GOT it up!!"
bk7x3c,"NTA, you should talk to her and tell her how you feel. However do not do it in a way that would make it look like your attacking her"

I am confused (as you prob are). You were told to clean the house without forewarning, which is not exactly a problem or anything but is a bit strange to me.

bk8jhp,"NAH. She has the right to be upset and it is fair if she isn’t interested in being friends because she wants more and you don’t want to give it to her. On her end I’m sure it is frustrating because from her perspective you are in to her and maybe she felt lead on. However, this doesn’t make you an asshole because you don’t have to want to be in a relationship and honestly you shouldn’t get in one if you don’t want to commit to it."
bk8kaw,"NAH

This situation is complicated and your best bet is to talk to J about how she would feel if you spend time with your friend and stay with him to save money on expenses. Considering she'll be doing the panel with her boyfriend, I'd be willing to bet (assuming she's reasonable) that she won't care but would likely prefer that you keep your time with D and your time with her separate."

bkaluw,"NTA. He isn't exactly wrong about her needing to learn responsibility, but he's going about it all wrong. You don't have these issues with her because you respect her as a human being, and if she's *volunteering* to help with laundry or other things, you're doing something right."

> I was a little annoyed bc I had spent months waiting on that position to be open and she only had just tried for it,

So, to get this clear, you think she didn't deserve the position because she hadn't suffered as much in the application process?  You don't say she isn't qualified, you don't say that her getting the position kept you from getting it.    And now, on the newest position, you're cutting her out of the loop because you don't want her to share it; ""kind of be my thing"".

>   Even when we are both looking for positions, I would never sabotage her or anything.  I love my friend and I’m always rooting my friends to succeed but idk why this case is just different. 

If you don't know why, and you're cutting a friend out of applications YTA.   You *are* sabotaging her.   And if you sabotage her, she's going to want to know why, and you don't have an answer."

As a woman, I genuinely don't understand women like this. When I was married, I would actively encourage my husband to have his 'boy time', because I thought it was important. 

I totally get why you dropped out, and it's good that no one gave you any shit for it. But what happens the next time you all arrange a guy's night? Is she going to re-insert herself? Or are you going to mitigate that by having it at someone else's house?"
bkb3en,"NTA it would be a little pushy if you expected updates for minor lateness, but ""I'll be home by 7"" turning into a message saying they haven't left yet at 10 is completely out of bounds, if the guy doesn't have a phone he definitely should've logged on and messaged you around, I don't know, 8 o'clock at least"

No. I do not send my child to school to learn to pray. Education and practicing religion should be kept separate.

Eventually the kids will realise they’ll get what they want when they go to her. This obviously a big issue.

I think you should have a calm and rational discussion about it in future, point out why it’s important for the kids to respect no as an answer etc. 

It definitely seems she wanted to take the easy route to keep the child happy instead of the correct way. Point out she’ll have trouble in future (with tantrums etc) if she gives in every time, instead of teaching them to respect her decision as being final.

I'm so fed up about how after 5yrs they accused me of cheating, meddled in our household, yelled at me, followed me and talked bad about me that I don't want to work things out with them. I dont want to see and hear them ever again. But I won't keep my gf from seeing them, I dont want to make it hard on her. Now she asked me if I can make an effort in trying to talk with her parents, yet I feel I have every right to deny that.

The attitude you have here may not be conducive to a happy long-term relationship with your girlfriend.  You say you don't want to make things hard on her, but her boyfriend refusing to talk to her parents *is* going to make things hard on her, regardless of who's right and who's wrong.  

My suggestion is take some time to calm down, then go talk to them.  Hopefully you get a sincere apology and a promise not to do it again, and you can start to repair the damaged relationship.  If they're defending themselves and making excuses instead, then fuck 'em, but at least you made an effort."

bkk6h2,"Hmmm... I understand both sides of the story.

Your parents (who are not only your parents but people with experience) want you to have your own income and to not depend all your life of them. Giving your age, it is logical you want to do your own thing, but the thing is, life will always have other plans. And you parent know it because it happened to them.

The best you can do is have a stable job, and to use your free time for your art. If everything goes as you want, there may be a time you can leave your day job and live of your art. But if this is not the case, you will have a job to not starve. This is what I did and so far I am still living and creating art in different forms. My job helps me a little, even (I am an IT and I love to tell stories, in books and in videogames, for example).

My husband works a job with a schedule just like this. What you need to know is that it will be hard on everyone. She will be doing _all_ the parenting with no help, and that can lead to resentment. It’ll be hard on your child, because believe it or not, a 7 month old can (and will) miss you.  And it’ll be hard on you because you will live in solitary hotel rooms and feel lonely a lot if the time. 

This kind of job is not for everyone. It can be a marriage buster. Many of the guys at my husband’s company who have this position have divorced, because of affairs or resentment that grows too toxic to deal with. 

The most important thing if you’re considering a position with significant travel is that you are both on board, and that you work together to make it bearable. My friend, your wife is _not_ on board here. That is a problem. Maybe where it’s a temporary job you can find a way to overcome that, but it’s also possible she will feel betrayed for a long time if you take the job because she told you what she thinks...and you ignored it. 

If you can’t really come to a consensus where you’re both okay with this job, I strongly urge you to find a different alternative. It wouldn’t make you an arsehole, per se, but it really could damage your marriage.

He also needs to make an effort to spend time with your family while they are in town. He certainly doesn't need to be with them 24/7, but when you marry, you are entering into a bigger family as well, & he needs to be social (particularly since he is the one who insisted they come)."

You could still allow her to see your kids in a neutral location or only in your own home with the rule that none of the terrible family members may be present.

Eight months is a long time to only see each other at school. It's fairly normal for kids that are dating(or even just friends) to want to see each other outside of school.

However, before doing anything rash, I would basically take everything you just told us, and make sure to explain it to her clearly, if you haven't already. You're allowed to want more from a relationship, but she may also have little to no control over what's happening, so I can't in good conscience call either of you an asshole.

You should just communicate openly with her about everything. What the issue is, what you want, and would could be done to resolve it, or come to a compromise.

You’re fucking over your coworker because you were tired.

I’ve worked shifts from 4:30-2:00am when the restaurant closed at 11:00 because the customers hadn’t left until 12:30 and the work took an hour and a half. It sucks, I hated it, I didn’t want to do it, but I didn’t put that work on someone else because I didn’t feel like it.

So, if her lying was such a big issue, why didn't you break up with her then? You actually *kept trying to get pregnant*, which is telling.

bkvyq3,"NAH; hear me out on this one. All the parents involved here seem to believe you're mature enough to watch both kids. You let your emotions get in the way of diffusing the situation which is expected of a 14 year old but isn't a great way to go about things when watching a pair of 5 year olds. 
The fact is that a lot of adults suck at interacting with 5 year olds when they get angry or jealous because it's hard to empathize with why one stick is the gold gilted sceptre of awesome and the other is dumb and the worst. There's definitely a learning curve with understanding kids that young. Just as it can be hard for an adult on their second child will take for granted that a 14 year old might not be equipped to handle feuding five year olds. 

A couple of suggestions;

Go to your father and ask him what he suggessts you could have done differently. Then explain that will know better for next time but that you only saw your sister getting hurt and acted on instinct.

Also, if you find yourself in this situation again go over and gently remove the attacker's hands from your sister (or vice versa if she's the one being physical) and say something like ""we have to use gentle hands with our friends"" firmly and then try to distract them from what caused the argument in the first place. This could include suggesting they do something different or (again hang with me on this) praising the bad stick and asking if you can take it because you like it so much. 

Kids are weird and hard to deal with, your dad isn't wrong in his reaction to you yelling at a kid, you aren't wrong for getting upset at the kid (you acted your age for good or bad), and the five year old isn't wrong because at five some sticks are just better than others."

bkz415,NTA - it's your party. It's about what you want not about appeasing others. If it gets brought up just be honest about why you didn't want them there. Just because they're family doesn't mean they get a pass to be annoying.
bkz62p,"NTA for asking, but

Like there's obviously some shit going on here. If he's super stressed or snippy, you may be oblivious to some underlying issues. That's fine. 

Time to learn how to ask without making it seem like you're checking up on what they do. Or tossing in a load of laundry. Just be sure you also get it into the dryer. Mildew on clothes is awful. 

He shouldn't have yelled at you. He shouldn't have been so defensive. But if your laundry is important to you, do it."
bkzbwr,"NAH. Chewing loudly/lip smacking is extremely annoying, your friend probably has no idea they’re doing it. Say something to your friend but be kind."

bkzn0u,Nta it's probably good for the little shit.
bkzuwv,"NTA. You have tried to help her, it's not your fault she left everything to the last minute.

To be honest, with my last move I had 5 days to redecorate the new place and pack up the old one and 2 people's stuff (partner was no help, partially disabled and terminally lazy, so they just checked out). I'd have loved to sit back and at the last minute cry and wail until people came to my rescue, especially considering I was so exhausted some nights I had to sit on a chair while packing things up, but I'm a goddamn grown up and I got that shit done."
bkzxhf,ESH. Dude sounds like a manipulative weirdo but you could’ve just moved on with your normal life.
bkzyl5,"NTA. You framed your complaint nicely. You weren’t calling her a rude bitch, you weren’t being emotional about it. You just said your piece nicely. 

I went to a theater production on a blind date when I was in high school and he looked at his phone and texted a few times (this was 2004) and it was appalling to me. 

I’m sorry your friends had a disappointing experience. Hopefully they can see you perform again, without the disruptive distractions."
bkzz3q,"As a parent, I would say NTA. Pee is still not good to eat and shouldn't be where people eat. I've had to change my babies diapers in many strange places and all you need to do is lay them across your lap.

bl03tu,"YTA - This has nothing to do with race, it's just shitty people being shitty."

bl0iws,"YTA - in my opinion, you do for family (this holds for “normal”,  non-abusive family). Your MIL sounds like she’s going through a real rough patch, and could really use some support right now. I think her needs trump your needs to relax in an evening at the moment. 

Your wife is right that you seem to have a bit of a double standard going on, despite your reasoning. Plus, she’d be able to help you out with a job you genuinely need doing! I personally think you just need to deal with this for a week for the benefit of your MIL, and also for you wife, who I’m sure would also benefit from having her mom close right now."
bl0k6k,"NAH. You don't have a right to be upset. You left your airpods in a pair of shorts you left lying on the floor. Accidents happen. Also, they're airpods. Why the fuck would you buy airpods?"
bl0rvi,NTA. Communication skills in a relationship are important. He clearly doesn't have them. You shouldn't feel like you're walking on eggshells around your husband. The phone thing in a restaurant actually triggered me a little bit.

I literally have no idea why this upset you.

>Am I the asshole for the complete shut off despite consistently saying that is the worse thing a person can do?

You seem like an overly dramatic person.  I don't think you need to stay in touch with exes, but I think blocking someone everywhere is usually an over the top move."
bl178y,"NTA. Seems like the trash took itself out on this one. If you don't have time to help her plan her wedding, then you don't have time. There are only 24 hours in a day and your friend should understand that."
bl18y5,"YTA, full stop.

This is the logic of an Incel, point blank. You cared more about who she slept with in the past than who she was currently sleeping with now: Which *was* you.

Enjoy that pickiness when dating. Trust me, finding a girl who's **never** slept with a douchebag starts to drop off very rapidly after they hit 20, and by their 30s every woman you date will probably have a history they're not exactly proud of.

She was probably trying to move on. Sounds like she just found a different flavor of asshole to make mistakes with."
bl1cjy,"YTA

While he was driving aggressively and dangerously, you did assault him by pulling his handlebars and forcing him to crash. He could have had you arrested, but he's only asking for you to pay for the X-Ray, so you're getting off light."
bl1ex0,NTA - Normally I would say everyone sucks here but it sounds like this guy deserves that sort of resignation. Two weeks notice would be normal but it sounds like he'd just fire you or make your life miserable if you did that.
bl1gna,The friend that took your ticket needs to pay for it. NAH
bl1hxz,"NTA.

You are not TA for wanting the house keys back, but your gf seems to think you are looking down on her family a tad bit too much. It might be wise to either have a conversation with your gf about setting boundaries together or softening the way you speak about her family."
bl1j7d,"I'm not going to rule a judgment, but I'm just going to say that I think hiding it is a bad idea. They'll think you smoked it, then they'll be pissed at you. They can just buy more. Talk to them about it instead."
bl1ktj,NTA- Tyler seems to want to control the group. Then he should book and do all that work. Making enemies is not the best idea with people that book.
bl1o0l,"NTA. ""we won't support you unless you serve alcohol"" is gross, especially in your situation. You aren't entitled to money, but that money was supposed to show their support for you and they clearly only support you if you serve them alcohol."
bl1v40,NAH you should do what is best for your mental and physical health. If not telling her makes your life easier then so be it.
bl1wcn,"ESH. Worth it to note that being jewish is not only a religious thing, but often a cultural thing and even an ethnic thing. Many many jewish people out there who are non-observant but otherwise identify as culturally/ethnically jewish."
bl23ej,YTA - frankly to me this reads like you took advantage of this girl when she was vulnerable (strung out on drugs and just out of a long term abusive relationship) and now don't want anything to do with her since she doesn't want to be romantically involved with you.  Did you really think she was in a position to begin a long-term stable relationship with you when you started having sex with her?
bl24f6,"NAH but asking her to sleep on the couch probably won't help anything. I'd suggest trying to train the dog to sleep elsewhere, maybe a bring a comfortable dog bed to the room so he's still nearby but not too close and taking up space?

My parents had the same issue, one getting a lot hotter than the other, so to solve it they use a double duvet sheet and put a single duvet inside so that one of them is sleeping under empty sheets and the other has a duvet. Obviously this wouldn't work too well if you're sharing a single."
bl26mz,"NTA

>My family, my mother in particular, is pissed at me. They say it's incredibly selfish and irresponsible to have made the choice I did. And my mom even goes on to say that my son needs to see me prioritizing work and earning over ""fun"" so that he can grow up with the right kind of priorities.

I'm really surprised at this. I think it's a much better lesson to teach your son about prioritizing family time and your close bond over materialistic things."
bl28d5,"NTA. Frankly I think it’s a bit immature for women to want their partner to start a confrontation to “stand up for them”. Being mature and avoiding senseless conflict is far more respectable and yeah, you don’t know that mans story. He didn’t even say a word to you or threaten her. She wants you to be “macho” and yell at an old man for looking?!"
bl2dtz,"NTA - You have every right to be mad. She’s simply attention seeking and being insensitive (talking about herself and her own trivial issues when i’m sure she is well aware you have a plethora of things on your mind concerning your forthcoming wedding)

Btw, congratulations! Hope everything goes great and you have an amazing wedding."
bl2fo3,"NTA. 

Aside from the fact that I also hate staying with people, I cannot imagine the cousin and husband will be comfortable having so many people in their house. I’d push for a hotel too. 

To throw the cherry on top, your daughters don’t need to overhear Frank’s lovely comments."
bl2hqs,"NTA. Having feelings and opinions doesn't make you an asshole. However, if you were rude to that person, then you'd be an asshole. If you don't like them, stay away from them and try not to talk about them or you may create drama that you don't want."
bl2ihg,"NTA - have a private conversation with her about it. I'm gonna guess its becauad she's sick of #2 roommate doing nothing, sees she'll have no communication in the future, so is being snippy. Depending on the outcome of your conversation you may wish to let #2 know the chores you do and that uyou won't be picking up #1's demands."
bl2j9p,"NTA - Might be better to say I’ll write off your debt as a birthday present,  which will assist with letting your resentment go plus act as a reminder that he’s not getting more out of you at this time"
bl2me7,"NAH

Even if it’s a mistake, that’s what it says. It’s not your job to make sure your contract is correct."
bl2ohz,NTA - You made it clear that you did not want her to wash your clothes and she ignored your request anyway. I get that she's trying to be helpful but the fact that you insisted on her not washing your clothes and she still did it anyway makes her the asshole and proves that she did not have respect for your wishes in that situation.

bl2wsj,NAH. I get her point because I don’t eat much either but why don’t y’all just save the food for later instead of throwing it out?
bl32v8,NTA - kid messed with an animal and repeatedly annoyed people after being told to stop multiple times. Little shit’s parents weren’t around so you had to take matters into your own hand.
bl34jg,You are not the asshole. She needs to use an enzyme cleaner like Nature’s Miracle. She should also switch to crystal litter. It’s much less stinky.
bl36zj,NTA things are not going to get better. As someone who lives with anxiety I would have loved to have people try to care enough to actually get help. Instead I have my Grandma treat me like an attention whore.

bl3ofq,"Dude. YTA. She is an adult woman and is allowed to consume whatever she likes. You don’t have to like it. If you had said it once and let it go, it’d be understandable but you’re nagging her now. You’re her boyfriend, not her doctor."
bl3ofx,"NAH. I don't mean to talk down to you, but you are a child. The mess that your adult mother has made of her life is not your burden. If you want a relationship with her, that's fine, but you cannot be responsible for her happiness. That is a very bad parent-child dynamic.   
I'm not sure what you mean by ""blocking her out,"" but if you mean keeping an emotional distance to protect yourself, that's okay too. I would suggest finding a counselor through your school or family to help you do that in a healthy way.   
Good luck with everything."

BUT an intervention is not likely to help. The issue here, with any addiction, is getting to the source of the problem. It’s about working on mental health along with physical health, and also completely altering their lifestyle.

Hosting an intervention won’t do this. But perhaps you could express your concern kindly, not about her weight, but her health. Encourage her to seek counseling and suggest physical activities to do when hanging out. Ask her to be your workout partner.

Just have a conversation with him and tell him that it’s awesome that he’s such a generous tipper but it’s not in your budget to match that right now, and you don’t want to take advantage of him, so you just want to let him know that when he orders for the two of him you’ll be reimbursing him for your share plus 20%.

bl4y55,">So WIBTA if I press charges?

If your fiance says to not press charges and (G) pays you back then you're the TA. Even then I say this grudgingly.

>I know the bank will likely need a reason for the cancellation and issue of new cards.

There are so many wonderful teachers out there, but there are also a lot of bad eggs. Unfortunately, some people become stuck in the bubble of ""school"" and cannot see a world beyond it. This has the effect of insulating them from having to judge their own competence--by the nature of their job, they are around people (students) who are less competent in almost every facet, and this can lead to the continuance of antisocial behavior and a sense of entitlement.

&#x200B;

That said, you should be reporting this behavior to your director as well. If what you are saying is happening, it is abusive and outside their duty of care.

I am sorry that you lost your drawing. Hopefully you can keep it and a memento of the sort of behavior to avoid in yourself. Remember the saying: a wise person learns more from a fool than a fool from a wise person."
bl5qdy,"NTA. Not at all.

She got upset because you didn't let her and her BF use you.

Do not sign another lease with her. Make sure she pays for the furniture her BF's dog damaged.

bl64o1,"ESH. He shouldn’t have gone through your phone. Sure, that was an invasion of privacy. Having said that. You’re an asshole for not being open and honest with your partner. Then you emotionally cheated on him with someone else because you were so emotionally closed off from him."

I have a chronic illness that left me bedbound a lot of my adolescence and it would completely shut me down and make me so so upset when my mom would share the details of my illness to completely random people.

See if you can have a special dinner with your family or an evening spending time with them to 'celebrated' your graduation or something like that."
bl87t8,"YTA. For two reasons.

1. Strictly based on what you've said, from her perspective, you're going from 0 to I won't talk to you anymore if you don't do what I say. Have you even tried talking about your feelings regarding Buck with her first? An ultimatum is never a good way to start a conversation, certainly not when the person you're talking to hasn't done anything wrong. Even ignoring a moral opinion on it, you're introducing your problem as an attack rather than a conversation, which puts her in a defensive position. And holding your relationship hostage. If it's your backup plan, that's one thing, it shouldn't be your opening move. ""Do X or I'm done with you"" is terrible to hear from someone you care about.

2. Ending a friendship because you don't like their friend is just a dick thing to do period. Saying ""I want nothing to do with Buck."" is fine, you're not obligated to keep toxic people in your life, and you didn't even know him beforehand. But what part of not talking to him means you can't talk to her? It comes across like you just want to monopolize her time, and aren't cool with her spending time with him even if you're not there. This is, again, assuming you haven't talked about it at all with her first, as your post doesn't say you have. Now if you have tried cutting Buck out before, made that clear to her, and she just refuses to respect that and brings him into your chats anyway, it's a different story."

Your friend sent you a clear message by blocking you after you were honest with her:  “I only want friends who will not challenge me to be better and will support my shitty decision making then be a shoulder to cry on when it comes out badly (as it has each and every time before this)”.  If you’re up for an emotionally draining friendship while you smile stupidly and watch your friend choose to be verbally and emotionally abused, then be the sole organizer of her pity party when the asshole does something asshole-ish and completely predictable, then by all means continue to contact her on other social media after she blocked you.  

She isn’t your friend.  She doesn’t value your opinion.  If you let her contact you without apologizing for her behavior, then you’re volunteering to let her put you through this again.  You seem like a good person.  You deserve friends who treat you with respect.

How you go about asking for payment should be considered carefully- don't go in too aggressively or sounding entitled or you could end up being TA and having your school payments cut off.

I think it would be a shame to not have a relationship at all because of this.  But I can see why you might have to making outings shorter.  Could you host in your home sometime to see if everyone could get more comfortable with the dog?

We don't have dogs.  We have cats.  We have relatives that bring dogs to every family gathering and I find it slightly annoying that the whole event becomes about tripping over these dogs that are marginally well behaved and don't actually like large social gatherings.  So does your dog actually like kids and behave well in a large group of people?  If those kids are at a crazy stage it might be really stressful to keep the kids off the dog all day."

You have valid concerns about the size of your home (though really, 3 dogs 5 cats already, how big and disruptive is dog #4?), and more so about the interactions between this dog and your dog.  However, the latter point can be overcome with disciplined training.  

Is the crux of the issue just that you don't want it?  That's OK but be honest about it.  Your GF can break up with you for any or no reason though so do you not want it enough to put your foot down?  Can you discuss a compromise like taking the dog pending rehoming with a friend or other family member?

Additionally, it's not at all clear to me that this expectation was ever made clear to your GFM. Unless there was a conversation you didn't mention where this was spelled out to GFM (which again, would be rude as fuck), I'm sure she assumed she would be asked to stay for dinner....which she was.

 *  Shouting at a 13 year old kid for 2 HOURS STRAIGHT over grades
 *  Criticizing you for your looks and your social life. If he's worried about you being lonely he should be finding ways to encourage you to socialize with other kids, not shaming you.
 *  Putting you in the position where you feel the need to defend your mother against him and then shaming you for it.
 *  Being immature about expressing his sadness that you don't call him. Instead of saying ""It hurts when you don't call me and I want us to have a better relationship"" he went tit-for-tat with this ""Well I'm not going to think about you either"" crap. Why can't he just call you, since he's the parent and has more responsibility here?

I'm not saying your dad is a bad person, just that he's not handling this situation well and it's okay if his behavior makes you not want to talk to him. I do think you should consider talking to him about how his behavior has impacted the relationship to try and work things out."

That's also not your fault because like you said, you'd never planned a night out before.

I'm also sorry to hear that you felt like your efforts at dressing up were wasted. But even if you were only out like that for three hours, you still looked good! You were with your boyfriend and friends, and they saw you like that at dinner.

Once you get out of med school, then you're away from home 80 to 100 hours at a stretch or more.  No.  

One of my cats came from someone who had gotten her as a kitten.  The girl had good intentions, but she brought this kitten home and either was already working 2 jobs and going to school or she started not long after she brought Sofia home.  At about the 6 month stage, she started talking about rehoming her (I worked with her cousin) but then decided that she had made a commitment and was going to keep it.  Admirable, but naive.  She finally gave her to  me when the cat was 10 months old and that cat had essentially gone feral inside that apartment.  It was literally 2 months before I could pet her without her trying to scratch or bite me.

It sounds a lot like “I will come and see you, but only when I can have sex with you”.

I have an amazing mum and step dad who I love very much. But, for me, wondering about that side of the family has always been extremely painful. I know my father was a dick and didn't want to meet me. But what about my grandparents? Uncles and aunts? Maybe siblings? Nevermind that I know nothing about half of my family's medical history, so I have no idea what I may or may not be at risk for. 

I'm 30 now and it was particularly bad in my late teens/early twenties, but it's still there. Maybe in a couple of weeks, when the dust has settled a little bit, ask yourself whether you think your ex would be abusive to your child. If the answer isn't 100% yes, then your child deserves to know where they come from."

On the other hand, I can totally understand where she’s coming from and not wanting to get fucked by a grading curve and wanting to have an advantage. Also, she’s doing great in all of her other classes by your own admission. Her reaction (from your description) seems genuine and her “fear” is very real as far as grading curves go, even though what she did was shitty. 

This kind of just sucks all the way around, honestly. You shouldn’t reward her when she cheated and didn’t meet the requirements, but I also get where she’s coming from and can understand her side.

So... NAH but I’m kind of leaning towards You’re the Asshole, I just... I don’t think You’re The Asshole though. Cheating isn’t right and should never be rewarded.

Sounds like he's happy with the way he is and has no real interest in changing. Since he has a good job and a functional social life, I think he has the right to enjoy his life so long as he isn't harming anybody, even if it is ultimately self-destructive.

My mother does the same thing. Even after I was an adult and was dealing with whatever health crisis / misfortune had cropped up. She makes it all about herself.

Please keep in mind I needed no caring / help. I broke my arm. I could still do things myself. I had my then-bf / now-husband bring me back to my apartment so I could heal in peace and not deal with my mother's drama. She became all offended over that too - you can't win with these types.

I've had medical issues since the broken arm incident, surgeries and other health misfortunes. I don't let her get involved at all. I just inform. She doesn't care unless it affects her directly in some form. Our relationship is fractured and strange, but it's better if I keep her at a distance.

Don't say ""the kids would be here all the time!"", rather say ""I really value our privacy and time together, and being 15 min away helps maintain some reasonable boundaries"".  keep it you and her focused."

bm8tqp,YTA because you were the one who lost the key.  Your carelessness led to you not being able to work.  You should stay late
bm8tx0,"NTA - It’s your money and your vacation, enjoy it as much as you want."
bm8wo1,So then you ghosted him? YTA.  Just reply that you changed your mind and don't want to see him.  THEN ghost him.  Don't leave him hanging.
bm90cf,"Wouldn’t be cool if her to post the video without your email permission.

But if you say you don’t snore, then proceed to snore. It makes total sense to record you"
bm929l,"YTA - you showed him up on his daughter’s graduation.  It’s a proud moment for a parent and you had to make a point.

I’d say he probably hasn’t forgotten it - and if you’re still feeling something today about it, here’s what you do:  Go to him and say “hey, I feel bad about the way this went down two years ago.  I made the situation about me because I didn’t like a comment you made.  The day was about your daughter and i should have let it slide.  I want you to know I felt that i was wrong in the situation.”"
bm92di,[deleted]
bm92wv,"YTA - There's plenty of other families out there who don't have the luxury of being able to ship off one of their children when a new one is coming along, this is a human being and not a pet and you shouldn't be getting rid of her because it's inconvenient to you. Your SO is an asshole here for not taking you into consideration and helping make more suitable prior arrangements and it's perfectly acceptable for you to be pissed with him for this, but you're the asshole for thinking of this little girl as a problem rather than a human being."
bm949q,"""you're too thin"" is a REALLY risky thing to say.  some people can take it, but it's unreasonable to think that it won't be offensive to everyone.  

I think it's reasonable that you were offended, and your feelings are legitimate.

He's not really justified in commenting negatively on your weight and then being surprised that you didn't take it well.

also, HIM being angry that you didn't take it well isn't fair. 

> I just told him I didnt like him commenting on my weight and telling me I'm ""too""- anything. 

that's an extremely reasonable and rational way to inform him.  if that got him hot and bothered, I have other concerns about your relationship. that's such an easy thing to respect.

NTA."
bm9cfq,"NTA. Seems like Larry has some hidden feelings if he's going to trash you for no reason.

This is also her friend, who you barely know, so confronting him without the girlfriend might make her be angry that you went behind her back."
bm9fay,YTA - you're putting a mediocre video game before your relationship and getting irrationally angry about it.
bm9mdc,[deleted]
bm9o1g,"NTA. You’re intentions were good and honestly If my parents were in another country, I wouldn’t worry them either. I’d wait till they were back and everything was fine to mention it. Your mom is a mom and she’s going to be upset regardless, so not the asshole. You meant well"
bm9qe4,"ESH (assuming you were to reply by hounding him)

Don't reply. Pretend like he does not exist. This guy has SERIOUS mental issues and there's no way to play this game that doesn't end with you losing. **Do not engage!**"
bm9tt0,NTA - your uncle sounds a little unhinged and should not be watching you.  Make sure you discuss all of this with your parents when they get back.  I can see being mad that you didn't listen to him but there's no reason to go bat shit crazy and not only threaten a child but then chuck their phone across the room.
bm9tv8,"ESH

This is the kind of shit that starts to seem desperately important when you're not happy in your relationship. Figure out what the real problem is, because this ain't it."
bm9u93,"NAH. Once a gift is given, it's given and it's yours to do with as you wish. There's no point hanging on to clothing that is out of style, doesn't fit, isn't worn, etc. It's just taking up space and preventing you from establishing a wardrobe that suits you.  Sell or donate the items and be free."
bm9ud0,"NTA - I can't say that I would go.  This sounds like one of those weddings where when asked ""If anyone has any reason as to why these two should not be married...."" and literally everyone should stand up.  Also, why weren't the cops called if your dad punched your 16yo brother in the face?  That's abuse!  Do you still live at home?  If not, can you leave and take bro with you?  If not, can bro stay with you for a while?  Does your mom get abused by your father?  All of this sounds like a horrible situation.  I am so sorry you are dealing with this."
bm9ur4,NTA for sure.
bm9v9b,YTA because this could make it worse for her. Her physical safety and wellbeing is on the line. You need to get her professional help instead of intervening the normal way.
bm9vqo,"It's extremely unrealistic to stay friends, but ghosting was not the best way to handle it.

say goodbye (over phone or text is fine), and break contact completely.

also, you might benefit from therapy.

i'm sorry.

NTA"
bm9xvq,NTA. They had it good and they ruined it. They got payed 40 hours a week for leaving early instead of why should be 38 or less. Your friend is a good boss. I'd like to be hores by someone like him.
bm9zki,"YTA

And a very, very soft and understandable one. I've had that happen to me as well, it sucks. But, you should be able to trust in your friend that they wouldn't. Otherwise, you will be triggered just anytime you hear Spanish, and that's really not healthy. When living in Korea, I would sometimes slip into English, it happens. Just let it be, I don't think you're racist, but I think you're overreacting."
bma0h8,"NAH only because she waited until after invites were sent out. If she had spoke up later that same day or even the next day before invites go out, would be a different story

She's not wrong in feeling her birthday will definitely be overshadowed by your graduation party though, I don't blame her for being bummed about that"
bma5nm,"NTA - So many red flags here. Have a serious conversation with him, where you lay out exactly what you perceive to be said red flags. If he dismisses them, and refuses to understand your side of it then dropkick him out of your life. (Not literally)

If he is receptive to your concerns though, see ways of working it out."
bma6lq,"YTA for repeating your opinion over and over and really hammering it home. Hair grows back. There's nothing so extreme she can do that changes that. It's just a color, and your reaction to it is incredibly immature. So what if she sticks out in a crowd? If her job doesn't care, and she likes it, what's the big deal?"
bmain3,"NTA

Your cousin is an adult and capable of making her own decisions.

If she ""gets in trouble"" with her husband because she's exercising her ability as an adult to make independent decisions and consume alcohol in a safe environment, she should probably get out of that marriage."
bmamzu,"NAH- you're a bookie now. As long as you continue to pay all winning bets,I see no problem."
bmanvs,"NTA, the dumbass got herself fired."
bmaptb,"NAH. Your uncle isn't wrong for trying to get you to sit with this kid, he knew that he was going to have a hard time and that his personal relationship with you might get you to be a little more empathetic, it sounds. But you're not wrong for wanting to sit with your friends, and not with a kid that sounds awful."
bmas96,NTA- that’s a hit and run. He SHOULD face the consequences
bmash4,"it's fair to ask him to wash his hands correctly, or to make him a taco.

it's not unreasonable to ask that he respect your standards, or to not eat.

that's not a ban, that's asking for a bit of respect."
bmawdx,"NAH. Good intentions all around. My advice? Go through the toys and throw away any that are broken or in particularly poor condition; donate the rest. I see where you’re coming from- and absolutely think it’s disrespectful to donate used, broken toys. There’s a reason that places that accept donations generally accept things that are “lightly used.”"
bmawpz,NTA- first of all he lied to you and it was not what you thought it was so screw him. You also should learn to not let people play you like he did tho.
bmaxop,"Don't be ridiculous, OP asked them in an incredibly polite way. There was literally a thread here the other day about a similar issue where the top comment suggested politely asking for their preferred pronouns instead of just assuming. Given that OP's coworker looks like a guy despite identifying as a female, it's pretty unfair of them to get angry at others for being confused about how to address them.

Edit: Added a word I somehow missed, because apparently English is hard"
bmb13q,So she's basically depending on your charity? NTA. A month is long enough to jump to another sublease at the very least
bmb75h,NAH- you are going above and beyond by donating any of it. Getting plasma taken out is more painful and takes longer than having blood drawn. Be proud you are doing it.
bmb9q0,"yikes.

NTA.

what i suspect is happening here is that you are protecting the wife by being to polite to explain why it's hard to be in his house.  the dad, not understanding, is giving you grief you don't deserve

i do think you need to try to explain (as respectfully as possible) why it's so hurtful to be there, from your step-brother, to the ignoring you, because it isn't fair that you be punished for trying to spare feelings.

good luck."
bmba5r,"NTA. 

They brought the rabbit home, they can fucking pay to keep it there."
bmbczq,NTA in any way. She chose to insult you. You could have asked her to stop but she is in no position to be talking about weight. You reap what you sow.
bmbd0e,"I understand your concern.  At that age, kids are still learning how to be friends.  It was important that you let her know that she was being out of bounds.  NTA."
bmbd9s,"NTA - 12k is cheap for a wedding in North America. 

Your older relatives are out of touch with modern day. 

Good luck."
bmbeh1,"NAH, provided you didn't know he had a sister with autism. 

He's not an asshole for being upset about the joke; some people don't take so kindly to jokes on sensitive topics. 

However, again provided you didn't know the guy had an autistic sister, you're not an asshole for making the joke either. It was good of you to apologise though."
bmbkaa,"NTA - you don’t have to go to a party for someone you don’t like, regardless of how sick they are or how well they treated you. Aside from that, are you 14?"
bmbl0u,NAH But definitely something she will have to get over if she wants to stay with you. It's not unusual for a woman to be upset that their SO slept with prostitutes.
bmbluh,"Wow, SO very much NTA. Nobody should give a kid food unless they clear it with the kid's parent/guardian first. That really should be common sense. There's no telling what allergies or food restrictions a kid has, and little kids frequently can't say what their issues are, or don't know to check. I've had a lot of people try to give my kid stuff with nuts, which he can't eat. He's old enough to ask and reject things with nuts now, but when he was younger it was an issue."
bmbp2w,"NTA

And she seems to have trouble dealing with rejection. Good luck if you ever need to break up!"
bmbsf3,"YTA - it ended because she couldn't accept your children, and she gave no indication that that had changed, why would you think this was a good idea?"
bmbwqj,"NTA. I'll probably be downvoted for this, but it's fine. Cats should be kept inside for a multitude of reasons. It's dangerous for them to be out wandering, they could be attacked or hit by a vehicle. Cats are also an invasive species, regardless of if your cat is spayed/neutered, it still poses a threat to wildlife that normally would not be at risk. Keep your cats indoors. If you can't handle having a cat inside 24/7, don't get one. It doesn't matter if the cat is crying at the door, they aren't wild animals and they don't belong outside."
bmc341,"NTA but good adulting advice: never tell people when you sell gifts.  Now you can't do it because you gotta listen to your mom.  Next time you don't want a gift, thank them for the nice thought and quietly list it on Craigslist or something."
bmc508,"NTA. If they're renting the entire bar, the party can't be contingent on one person. (right?) They should understand you (and your bf) can't just do this any other time, and you've already come every year for three years to support/have fun with them despite not loving EV yourself. I understand why they'd want you to come and it is only once a year, but still feel they're being a bit selfish."
bmc6cr,"INFO why exactly are you so hung up on being friends with a bully? People stop being friends so I’m not sure why you’re so hung up on the fact that you were okay with each other last year. 


That being said ESH. She can’t tell you who to be friends with but it’s pretty fucked up to be friends with someone who is actively bullying someone you consider to be a friend. You have no reason to keep being friends with Cookie other than the fact that you have a mutual friend and were cool last year."
bmc6n0,"NTA
All jailhouse calls cost money.  The visits are difficult for children (for those who don’t know, waiting for hours without so much as a pencil or a snack). It seems to me that if he wanted a relationship he would have kept himself out of trouble.  

You have enough on your plate raising 3 kids on your own.

NTA"
bmc8nb,"NTA.

Sounds like Chris is hiding something, I dunno. But it's weird that he doesn't want/won't let you tell anyone you're dating. And then he gets mad at this dude, and he apparently wasn't even surprised so it's like he knew the guy liked you, probably cause he's seen how he looks at you.

I dunno, Chris sounds like an asshole. 

Peter sounds like someone that actually likes you and* wants to be with you and wouldn't mind everyone knowing. And yet you'd rather be with a guy who wants to keep you a secret.

Edit: a word"
bmca5t,You really have no legal recourse to deny entry except for the notice not being given 24 hours in advance. Report him to the fair housing board if u must but Yta if u deny entrance.
bmcb67,"NTA - everyone say it with me ""It's your child you can do what you want""."
bmcbkb,"NTA, you and boyfriend are happy and that’s all that matters. Who cares what a bunch nobodies who have nothing better to do than judge other peoples relationships think?.....wait a second..."
bmcd5y,"NAH, her reaction is understandable, but I can’t fault you for sticking to your principles."
bmcj22,"NTA:

That approach sounds like an excuse for your professor to not have to grade anything lol"
bmcpkb,"NTA. Just tell SIL and the MOH that while you'd love to join, its out of your current budget and you look forward to the ceremony"
bmcqcq,NTA. I understand why your mom is upset and it seems like you also are upset with your dad. But the issues in your parents’ relationship are not yours. He is still your dad and your mom should not impede a relationship between you and him or his newly acquired family.
bmctci,YTA. Maybe try saying excuse me before pushing through if the person has no idea you’re there
bmctph,"NTA - You gave him many chances to get his act together. You probably could have phrased things better and not ""snapped"" but it doesn't make you the asshole. You told him what you needed for the day and he ignored your requests."
bmcv9q,"NTA - if you advertise a fair price for the room and utilities and they’re willing to pay it then there’s really no issue if you’re paying a little less, especially if it’s your name on the lease and you’re ultimately accountable for the property."
bmcvog,NTA - It's a legitimate concern. Though you seem to have reasoned yourself that their response might be pretty harsh so it could go either way. As a compromise I'd tell an employee at the place and just let them know so your concern is addressed but nobody gets shitcanned.
bmcxk1,"NTA- From what I read I take it you are living on a strict budget to be able to afford the wedding of your dreams. I would not blame you for wanting to dedicate your time to something you will definitely remember for the rest of your life. There will always be more dance recitals but only one wedding with your soon to be husband. That being said, I would voice your feelings to your fiancé and his mother (fiancé first) and tell her how important this wedding means to you. If you are comfortable with doing so of course."

bmd1a9,"ESH.

Yeah, man. Gotta level with you. Your closing shot was... Really too far. I get the whole heat-of-the-moment thing but... Jesus Christ man...

That being said, it sounds like she's minimizing your fears and not hearing them fully. The comprises she's offered ignore your concerns and favor her side. So, I mean, I guess you have that going for you.

In the end though, you seem to have done a lot more unnecessary damage with your words. It's time to man up and extend that olive branch, dude. You said some horrendous things to her.

Edit: thx for silver?"
bmd4v3,ESH. She sucks. You suck. You all suck.

bmd74z,"NAH:

Not sure how to say this without sounding rude, but I feel like if I were one of the other parents that didn't see the actual fall, I'd probably also assume that the 2.5 year old pushed the 1 year old if she literally said she did...this would kind of read like an r/entitledparents story in that way.

Obviously, that's not actually what happened, and you're not an entitled parent. I don't think your kid should have had to apologize. Still, though, I can't say I blame the other parents for how they saw things."
bmdbpq,NTA. You have constantly reminded your husband to check the gas level. It's not like you kept silent and then blew up about it. It's understandable that you became frustrated after telling him so many times.
bmddwb,"Uhhh, this is either a miscommunication, him being an asshole, or you're not telling the full truth about how you ""said"" that you thought you guys had plans together and instead you yelled it or something. But just from your story, it sounds like NTA. Even if there wasn't clear confirmation that the gym thing was a plan for both of you, he didn't need to react that way."
bmdf7k,"YTA, and it's people like you who contribute to school shooters developing. How about instead of pretending as if he's a soon-to-be school shooter you make an effort to actually befriend this poor person?"
bmdlxo,it’s like choosing between your cat and your dad. Pets are important but that’s your dad and he probably needs some company after the passing of your mom. Get someone to babysit your cat
bmdly3,NTA. That is a huge life choice/change and you should only agree to it if you'd be prepared and willing to devote the necessary time. I don't think anyones feelings should be hurt from you turning them down. Kids are a huge responsibility.
bmdn75,"Yta

Just move on. This is such a minor thing and the school year (at least in the US) is almost done so you won't have the teacher anymore. And I why would you be punished the day after the incident? That doesn't make sense. If he tries, go report it to the principle. From what you described the teacher won't believe you even if you tell him the truth."
bmdndx,NTA.  She should have asked ahead of time if that was cool.  Not do it anyway with you suffering the consequences of you got caught.  Pretty inconsiderate.
bmdr4c,"YTA 

Just because you didn’t cause it doesn’t necessarily mean you shouldn’t help your friends/Roomates out.. the thing you said about you not bringing bedbugs into the place shows me that you don’t understand the nature of them either. They’re nearly microscopic and bad hygiene or other factors like that aren’t ALWAYS at play. They feast on blood and humans tend to have a lot of that so any person could end up being as unlucky as your friend was. Plus, if you don’t come up with the cash to get it treated, you’re all kind of boned. They will spread like wildfire without professional treatment.

You both cheated, and you feel bad. You should tell your partner what you did,  but you don't get to go easing your conscience  by telling his."
bme459,NAH this is a big old case of “life happens”. Good luck sorting it out.
bme777,Absolutely NTA. All the adults in your life failed you and now you’re living with the consequences. Do you have access to healing resources? Does your father still have access to children?
bmeetb,"I agree with you except on the part of the “dad” figure. You relate him to things like “open”, “honest”, and “not an asshole”. Imo there’s no excuse for abuse and he’s definitely an asshole. On top of it, him and his wive fuck up parenting, yet expect good grades from the kids. A bad childhood often has a major negative impact on grades. But you’re right on the fact that the dad doesn’t have to pay for anyone’s college/uni degree if he doesn’t want to."

3 hours...? The fuck is she doing in there? You haven't said, so I have to assume she's built like Terry Crews, nothing else makes sense to me.

bmegqx,"NTA, suffering isn't a competition, when will people learn."
bmeiey,"YTA. I think it’s almost cute how naive this sounds that it’s actually endearing. That being said, this is not how you handle a disagreement, and hopefully you’ll learn now as opposed to later. The right thing to do was actually talk to your friend; tell them how you feel and how you’re concerned for them. 

Ultimately, *you’re* not in charge of his body. Kid’s a sophomore in high school. High schoolers smoke; that’s the reality of things. The fact that you’re responsible for him losing his entire, very limited summers makes you the asshole."
bmelab,ESH LMAOOOOOOOOO idk what the right answer is here but I'm going with this is petty on your part and your boyfriend went about it in a ridiculous way. Proposals are so overrated but he was immature about it too
bmem7o,"YTA for stringing her along, and I have a feeling you didn’t try to work these problems out?"
bmeop3,"NTA. These fucking brides and hair holy shit..... Go to the wedding, be the person you are on your own terms.

Its okay to voice a preference, but she can do whatever she wants with her body. The fact that you ""don't understand why she wouldn't"" is bothersome. You don't need to understand her reasons. So sure, share a preference but don't push her to alter herself to fit your preferences.

Her screaming at you was totally uncalled for, and she should apologize but it's probably not going to happen.

What you did isn’t the same as a piercing or even bright blue hair, people can literally stare into the inside of your body.  

Goddamn I can’t believe I’m actually siding with the bride on this one, but yeah you are the asshole and your sister would’ve been justified in not making you and your mouth hole a visible part of the most important event of her life."
bmgdfy,"YTA

Honestly it just seems like you are making excuses for your behavior by blaming the way you acted on your professor. Talking to a friend while the professor is trying to teach a class is pretty disrepectful, and trying to start a fight with the professor for ""calling you out"" (despite them not mentioning you by name) is definitely entering deep into asshole territory."
bmgg9g,"NTA, also seriously dude I'd recommend moving out asap, that does not seem like a good environment"
bmgheg,"NTA but this is not as cut and dry as convincing him to stand up to his mom. OP You clearly love and want the best for you BF. Unfortunately you trying to force him or in any way manipulating your BF (no matter how good your intentions are) into doing something he is not ready to do may not work out like you think. This is years and years of layered abuse that cannot be fixed by one conversation. This is a family unit that is so dysfunctional but from what it seems still very involved in each others lives. It would be difficult for him to take a stance & then know how to deal with what blowback he might face from any one of his family members. He really needs to seek professional help to sort this out and learn to set healthy boundaries. The best thing you can do is support him, be there for him, let him know you are a safe space that won’t judge or tell him what to do unlike his mom. If he is open to therapy go with him. I wish you both all the best."

bmgwh1,"NTA- She has legitimate concerns that this job won't last forever and you'll wind up very much out of practice for the job market when that does happen whether that's a month, a year, or ten years. At the same time, the way she's going about it says she's clearly jealous about how she's putting in so many hours and making a terrible wage for it.

You're not an asshole in this situation because you're doing the work the company asks of you. So long as you are diligent, reliable, and accurate, it's up to them to decide whether you're worth the wage. At the same time, you're a fool for not stepping up your game and either putting in significant time building skills or working a second job that you enjoy without needing to concern yourself with whether it pays a decent wage.

So to summarize, GF isn't wrong, but she is an asshole. You're not an asshole, but you are wrong."

Mental illness can explain bad behavior, but it cannot excuse it. You weren’t well for a long time and apparently said things that hurt your loved ones. It’s inappropriate to say “it wasn’t my fault I was sick” because the connotation is unfortunately victimization. 

Look, I have PTSD and a slew of other diagnosed mental issues. Sometimes I lash out at my husband for almost no reason. I never say “not my fault cause PTSD”, but I do often say “I am sorry my behaviors caused you pain, it’s not an excuse but I acted like X because Y & Z were triggers for me.

However, he didn't know and was concerned about you. He shared his concern with his friend, who gave him good advice. The fact that his friend is also a coworker is irrelevant here, and he probably wanted her advice in part because she is a girl herself. So he's not an asshole either.

Maybe talk to this other mom and let her know that you understand how fond she is of your daughter but you're pretty fond of her yourself and you have some upcoming plans that conflict with some of her invitations."
bms8db,"NTA for sure. it sounds like she's being manipulative, hoping youre gonna offer her change or to pay. if she's ALWAYS short change, then she needs to be more cautious of what she orders. she's a grown ass woman. its not your job to take care of her."

That said, while it's fine and normal to be angry, maybe take a moment to think about that other dog and see this as an opportunity to let this good boy or girl have a loving home. And it's better than the owner dumping it at the pound, which is probably what will happen, then there will be two dogs with their lives cut short. It's current owner obviously is not bonded and every dog deserves to be loved and give love. It's not wrong if you decide you don't want to, but maybe just consider it. It also might be easier on your younger dog to have a buddy to be with him/her when the inevitable happens.

Again, my heart goes out to you."
bmso65,"ESH. I understand that you want her problem to stop affecting the family, but yelling at her and digging into her like that isn't going to help anybody.

bmtbjz,"As an addict myself, I will tell you that YTA for making your use out to be her fault.  If you want to get sober, you MUST stop blaming other people for your use.  It's easy to look for someone else to blame, but blaming then will not get you sober.

You're asking for validation on here for that behavior, whether you're aware of it or not.  There will always be a good excuse for why you used this time.  Always.  Your brain will always be incredibly talented at justifying your use.  It sucks, I know.  But, it does absolutely no good to blame anyone.  

What does do good?  Deciding that there's nothing left for you at the end of a joint, or bong, or vape, or whatever.  

I'm going to tell you this, and it's going to sound like I'm exaggerating, but I think you're at a place where you can follow the future paths you have in front of you to their conclusions.

Your addiction is going to kill you.  Not directly, but probably eventually by your own hand, or potentially by a cop's hand when they are trying to subdue a person with a clear break from reality who refuses to cooperate.

Maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but absolutely one day, and probably sooner than you think.

Can you think of an extended period of time during your use (months/years) where you were actively using and life improved?  If not, then don't let your brain convince you that you can continue to use like you do and still get better.  

Check out r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY and r/alcoholicsanonymous.  (Yes I know weed isn't alcohol, but the 12 steps can work for many addictions, and many meetings accept people of all addictions).  

Regarding your wife... Forget about being mad at her.  How does she fit in to a future where you are staying sober?  Anything you make more important than your sobriety is something you are going to lose.  Can she support you in that?  You'll have to come to that answer on your own.

Edit: thanks for the gold, but please stop down voting OPs replies in this thread. These are normal, sane reactions to such a painful conversation.  You don't just flip a switch one day and say, yep everything here is true! You have to come to terms with it, and OP obviously was."
bmtd2v,YTA. Enforcing parking laws is the job of the police and if you're concerned about someone's parking then report it to them. Spitting on someone else's car is gross and juvenile and if the person notices they probably wouldn't even know why you spat on their car in the first place.
bmtda5,"NTA Your family needs you to help out by watching your little brother, unfortunate, but necessary, and given how hard your mom is working this is just a bad situation. However, your family does not need you to take your brother to the park. It needs you to keep him safe and well. This can be done without a park trip. It would be reasonable for your little brother to contribute to the family by accepting that he won't always get to go out and do fun things and sometimes needs to entertain himself at home. Note, I'm not really faulting him for not getting this, as he is quite young. But your mother should not have pushed for the particular way you cared for him beyond safe and reasonable (trying to keep him reasonably happy within the limitations of your energy)."

How would you feel if someone did that to you?"
bmubsw,"NTA. While your words were harsh, they are a result of years of having pets prioritized over you and your father's health, happiness, and lives. The situation is completely unfair to you because although animals have value and deserve love, your mother has been neglecting you and your family. Furthermore, you two made an agreement that she is now disrespecting. By taking in animals that she cannot care for, she is being irresponsible and selfishly expecting you and your father to suffer for it. Perhaps you could consider saving your money and no longer lending it to your parents, so you have the means to leave if you need to/the situation worsens.

How does your father feel about this situation?"

If she had that much trouble paying her bills either she needs to work more hours, pursue some better career options, cut costs, or try to move to a cheaper place.

You owe her $200 and are trying to justify slinking away from it. Leave or stay in the friendship, but either way be an adult and pay her the money."
bmv2ve,I don’t understand why you’ve been giving them anything in the first place so I’m really not sure what judgement to give... if someone not related to me gave me a Mother’s Day present I’d honestly think it was a bit weird and probably not know what to say.
bmv4he,"NAH. Your husband is having a bout of low self-esteem, it happens. It’s annoying to be around sometimes but you can gently support him to get healthier. I would probably be irritated by the constant talking about it but not doing anything about it, but the behaviour is typical of someone experiencing a loss in confidence. That said, you didn’t say he was fat. You reminded him of a goal he made himself. That does not make you an asshole. He is being over sensitive about that. Maybe rather than be annoyed at his behaviour, support him through this by suggesting going on walks/hikes or the gym together, and focusing on eating healthier together. He might appreciate that more than feeing like he’s being reminded of his failures (even though that wasn’t what you were trying to do)."
bmvn6c,"YTA Because they are sick and getting good sleep is part of what they need to get better. But you're also in a tough situation.

You are 100% entitled to the $350 that was borrowed of you. Period. I’m not sure how they feel they have any argument here, or what their argument is even supposed to be?

I can understand how small and anxious it can feel to live in a space where it seems like multiple are against 1, but it would feel like that regardless of how wrong they were; the more people who are against you in a situation, the more it can tend to breed doubt in yourself. Being outnumbered is often an overwhelming feeling. They are outright taking advantage of this and your soft spoken-ness by using you as a doormat... because they are confident that they can. They’re manipulating you to the point that you’re actually questioning if you’re an asshole for wanting $350 that’s owed to you paid back. 

I’ve been in similar situations, though, OP. The logic behind the manipulative behavior is so bizarre, so mind-numbingly nonsensical, that you almost want to be the asshole because it’s less hurtful to believe than accepting someone close to you would treat you that way. Personal life details and financial well-being are null points in these situations, If someone owes you money, they owe you money, period. You’re a kind-hearted and good person. They’re idiots. Disregard their attempts to tear you down. Good luck with everything.

EDIT - Spelling and wording, though I also wanted to ask, as I may be misunderstanding; are you wanting the girl, who’s cat deposit you paid, or everyone agreed to help cover, to pay you back, or are you wanting EVERYONE to take money out of their deposit to cover it when they never agreed to? My answer is based off of some form of the former."

bmydra,"NTA if you dont suggest breakup. As a friend, you can voice your concerns, but I would not suggest anything else than him getting to know her better and finding if that’s all she’s been hiding. 

You could very easily be the asshole if you go to him and go “your girl seems dodgy you should break up”"
bmygfn,"NTA. Your boyfriend has the right to go out without you, but this situation seems shady. I can see why you feel uncomfortable and opposed to him going. It's extremely inconsiderate of your boyfriend to shrug off your feelings while knowing he'd feel the same as you if the positions were swapped. It's disrespectful of him to essentially admit that he doesn't care about you, that he prioritizes his desires/an event over your comfort and feelings. Why he is acting as if he is more important than you? The way that he ended the conversation by expecting you to give in is a huge, red flag and shows that he doesn't value you."
bmyhz3,I mean yeah kinda YTA.  As much as it sucks that's just how you deboard a plane; in order.
bmyk3w,"NTA - you’re dealing with a lot right now.   Are there any other relatives that you can contact?  A grandmother or aunt that could act as a go-between, where you can still see your brother but not deal with the asshole?"
bmymyq,"NTA but you better get a lawyer in there *now* because financial elder abuse is a HUGE problem, especially with sisters like yours who think nothing of abusing the vulnerable and your grandmother IS vulnerable.

Her rewritten Will may in fact be invalid, because she may not mentally competent to change her Will. 

NTA for being angry, but do get a lawyer and see what else she's been up to. The Will is probably just the least of it."
bmyrc7,YTA. I think you know what he meant.
bmysy4,"NTA.

this has all kinds of warning lights flashing on it.  stand your ground.

also, keep track of your own mental health during this.  might be wise to have some friends check in on you form time to time.

Perhaps let your daughter drive how often she wants to see and hang out with mom, but don't give up any of your legal custody."
bmyt89,"NAH, you're trying to help him get ready for his new job. But honestly, who waits and buys clothes for their fancy new job until they're driving to their first shift? He sounds really flustered."
bmytgz,"NTA, can we just back up to the part where your mom felt it was okay to look at your bank statements and interrogate you about what you're spending your money on?  Man fuck her.

If it wasn't this she would just be a bitch about something else."
bmyub3,"NTA Your parents are sabotaging themselves, trying to hold on so tightly to their children and control over their children's lives that they are shoving them further and further away, but that isn't your fault. Hopefully, they will come around with you as well. But you aren't required to stay with them just because they want you to, and they are making it so difficult for you to tell them."
bmyv2g,"NAH

You did the right thing. Jake is suffering right now. Hopefully he will get the help he needs and realize that you care about him."
bmywa5,"NTA.  Your wife is an asshole for saying ""**we** will support her"".  This is the only life you've got.  If you don't want to be a step-grandfather at 32, that's for you to decide not her."
bmyx1d,NTA: You aren't trying to change who he is or anything. He could pick the same color he has now from what you said here. Just a higher quality job. The boyfriend is going way overboard with this.
bmyx3s,"NTA I’m a female and if male cleaners came into the bathroom without knocking while I’m in the bath I’m ALONE I’d be super uncomfortable. Just because you’re a male doesn’t mean you don’t get uncomfortable. Fuck all these people acting like it’s ok and you’re the asshole. If it was me I honestly wouldn’t talk to the cleaners I’d go straight to a manager or whoever lets you use the bathroom and be like “hey, not trying to get anyone in trouble because I really appreciate you letting me use your bathroom but this is going on and I’m worried it might happen to a customer.”"
bmz0wh,[deleted]
bmz4er,"NTA 

There’s a golden rule of keeping personal and professional lives separate. Especially when it comes to community health centers. They’re already overworked as it is. The last thing they need is a bad attitude."
bmz7zn,NTA and get out of there as soon as you can.
bmz9l7,"NAH.

do your best as a family to encourage him to get help, but in the end, your brother is an adult, and you can't force him."
bmzagb,"YTA because you assumed he was holding the door open for her. He gave you no indication he was, you just assumed. Then you called him an asshole becuase neither you nor your girlfriend had the foresight to imagine that somebody might be thinking about something other than you. From his perspective, he may not have known what you were angry about and could have thought you were starting shit. Which you were."
bmzchv,"NTA

> he’s been secretly texting her that he loves her

While its very possible context is key here, taking it at face value this is over the line. You can reach out and be there for someone you know without expressing love and especially without doing it behind your S/Os back."
bmzf8h,"NTA.  Her dog went into you room and ruined your expensive item.  That being said, you need to store your earbuds better"
bmznex,I would probably just send a card or flowers to acknowlege her birthday/mothers day to show you made an attempt and that puts the ball back in her court. I probably wouldn't go above and beyond just showing you tried.
bmzo7r,NAH.  Go and have fun.  Stop overthinking this.
bmzrgv,NTA for not wanting to play games with children. It's your choice who you spend time with
bmzu58,NAH - But don't sacrifices your education for a single night.
bmzxu8,"YTA If you never talked to them about it at the time, I wouldn't use their wedding as an excuse to talk to them about it now. Just politely decline and be done."
bn000n,NTA: I find it repulsive these brides expect so much done for them in their wedding day. I paid for everything for my wedding except for the bridesmaids dresses and tuxes the guys rented. Even then I gave my bridesmaids freedom to choose what they wanted to spend and kept it really cheap. I chose to have a wedding not everyone else.
bn05q2,"NTA

This doesn't have to be an issue. Stand for the prayers, participate in the services. Just the way you would at a Muslim or Jewish event. Be respectful. You don't have to lie.

I seriously doubt anybody is going to be staring at you during the prayers to make sure your lips are moving."
bn0902,NTA.  I get your mom's thinking on this but you absolutely get to set the rules in this scenario and she really ought to be able to get that.
bn09gl,"NTA 

Title means you own it. Her family is a bouquet of dicks."
bn0c01,"NTA -  sounds reasonable to me,  I mean at least for her to apologize,  not sure it really needs to be in writing but it’s better than the alternative.  Also if Count Dracula over there didn’t want to get in trouble or be embarrassed,  maybe she should keep her teeth to herself ?"
bn0dew,"NAH I think it would be almost more awkward to ask in advance if she was planning on getting you a gift, but it certainly would be presumptuous to expect one. I don't see why you can't open some gifts before and some gifts during."
bn0gsz,"YTA - You ultimately can't expect others to do the things you do without communication. JUST because you changed things like that in YOUR phone, doesn't mean he's going to do the same automatically. He's not a mind reader.  


If you trust him, let it go :)"
bn0hh7,"Dafuq? Is my reaction to this post as well lol. 

NTA."
bn0j5d,NTA. All valid reasons. Is there any reason why you can’t take your car or your gfs car?
bn0jcu,ESH. He should have discussed his fees with you ahead of time. You should expect to pay a professional for their services.
bn0jg1,"I don't understand or agree with your view and I do think you are being selfish not even considering a donor or looking into other options like selective IVF. I think it's extremely selfish to bring a child into the world knowing that they will be at high risk for a major disability (if you do indeed know that). YTA for how little you care about your children's quality of life. All that matters to you is creating a biological kid between you and your bf at the expense of that child, at the expense of your bfs feelings, to the degree that your relationship is worthless if he won't take that risk on his child's quality of life? It's not like he doesn't want kids, he just doesn't want to subject his kids to the known risk of a very serious disability.

Disagreeing about children is a major dealbreaker and you're not TA for moving on from a relationship where you don't want the same thing in life. But he does want kids. Would you dump him if he discovered he's infertile? What about if you turn out to be infertile; what then, do you think you'd be okay with being thrown out after a long term relationship because you can't incubate for someone? If someone threw away your relationship because you were barren, do you think your family would consider that person to have been an asshole and selfish, or would they agree that relationships with you are that worthless?

I don't think anyone is TA for leaving an incompatible relationship. But I think YTA for how selfishly you are approaching this. You love an imaginary fantasy of parenthood more than you loved your BF and so much that your children's quality of life is irrelevant to you."
bn0lgo,"I'll probably be in the minority, but YTA. It sounds like this has only happened twice recently. I get that you want to spend time with him, but he is going to want to hang out with other people too. If you had concrete plans made in advance to go see a movie or something, and he cancelled that, then you'd be justified. But for dinner and chill type nights I don't think it necessitated starting a fight. I wouldn't say this makes you clingy, but it does look a little like you tried to make something out of nothing."
bn0nbr,"NAH, but you have to work on communicating with (and listening to) your boyfriend."
bn0ofp,"NTA.  Some people don't like having houseguests at *all* and that's fine.  You actually have very good reasons for not wanting houseguests.  I wouldn't expect it to go over particularly well with your in-laws-to-be, but maybe they'll be fine with it.  Good luck."
bn0oso,NTA. It's not unreasonable to not want to drive four hours for a quick family event. Your mother is being super pushy about this. But this is your sister's thing. How important is it to HER that you attend this event?
bn0wbu,"NTA. Honestly, people should be considerate of other people’s time. It’s bad enough they were late (without telling you, I assume), them blowing you off to smoke is worse. Not going to comment on talking with the random lady because that might have been legit."
bn0wf9,"NTA. If I were her manager, I'd want to know this. Firstly, so I could have a talk with her and make sure everything is okay in her life. Maybe she's going through something and needs time off. Secondly, because customer service is important. 

It sounds like she realized what she did and it's good that she apologized. But if I were her manager, I'd still want to know about this."
bn0x3x,"NTA, but your girlfriend is.  

It was a guys night.  It changed.  She was invited.   Her non-asshole choices is to accept, or say no thanks.   Getting upset was not cool. 

I will say from a counter perspective is read between the lines here.  She is not upset because ""now it's okay to invite her because other girls will be there.""  She is upset because one of your friends made the first move to include their GF, and you didn't.   That creates the impression that some of your friends cared enough for their partner to break up a ""guy's night"", but you waited until it was already broken.  That's the perception here, I think, and the real reason she is upset."
bn0y8l,NTA: They can only control you if you let them. You are 18 and they legally have no say over anything you do. Their behaviour is completely unreasonable and beyond controlling. I would reccomend looking for housing if you're financially stable.
bn0zzk,"YTA, but I think asshole is too strong here. As long as he specifies which time zone he means, I don’t see the big deal. You’re just as capable as he is of converting the time zone.

As far as it being a power play, he’s the client. He has the power. Do you want him to pick a different provider who will take whatever time zone he gives times in?

Edit: I have zero experience with international business, so take this with a grain of salt."
bn160k,"NTA

Don't go.  They don't really want you there."
bn17zq,"NTA. My GF started checking mine in an annoying way once, so I got a location spoofer app and just to mess with her, I was in another country every day when I left for work lol"
bn19xm,"YTA, it's actually a really common situation that you end up dating the friends of your deceased spouse (my grandma got engaged at 93 to her late husbands best friend). At a certain point in your life you aren't meeting a ton of new people and you are very likely to have a lot in common in terms of values, shared grief, shared experiences etc with the friends of your deceased spouse."
bn1bn0,"Yes YTA? 

lol. 

she didn't reply because she didn't want to. (might not have even given you her real number dude) 

if a girl wants to go out with you she will. if she doesn't she won't... don't push it and try to make things awkward or her feel guilty for not wanting to go out with you. 

yes she could have said no (if she even got the message) but also you could just let it go...."
bn1cj4,"I was kinda on your side until this: 

>I do this to create an association in her mind that periods=good

WTF you're not her programmer. YTA. Stop trying to brainwash your girlfriend and respect her a little."
bn1ged,"NTA - she's not respecting your beliefs or parenting decisions. Her beliefs do not trump yours. She’s a repeat offender, so this sin't a surprise, which makes her an a-hole."
bn1hdk,"NTA. If the landlord failed to tell them that bands were always playing next door during regular working hours, then that is on the landlord and not you guys."
bn1iku,"NTA if people want to watch videos on their phones in public, use fucking headphones. So annoying."
bn1tdc,"YTA.

They used a throwaway, indicating they probably didn't want it to reach their circle. 

If their AITA wasn't malicious or hurtful to anyone, then you bringing it to light was simply messy and wrong. Poo on you."
bn1tde,"NTA, get a lawyer to go over them and tell him to screw off.

Your wife needs to start standing up for you here."

bn1uns,"NTA and I get why you’re upset, and I know it’s disappointing, but I think you may have overreacted a bit in the heat of the moment. He was not kind either. I hope you got to snuggle her, and have a great Mother’s Day!"
bn1v7j,"YTA for making this a fight because you had a bad day at work. She's trying to help her friend, this dude isn't a threat. 

That being said, this will probably not end well for your girlfriend or her friend."
bn1vtx,"NTA, I'm sorry, but you're trying to find a way to make this your fault bc you don't want to deal with him not being interested in a relationship with you.  It sounds like he was very deliberately using silence to force you to be the one to break things off.  

This makes him a huge wimp.  Being in a relationship with someone like this suuuuucks, you dodged a bullet."
bn1w9e,"NTA.  Being afraid of being confronted over something stupid she did is her fault, not yours.  If she wants to apologize she can."
bn1wej,"ESH-you need to enforce rules better and he needs to not break them, but calling a child retarded, regardless of if it is true or not, makes you an AH as well."
bn1wxz,"NTA. Clearly. You took care of him when no one else was there for him. It was his wish for you to have that revolver, and therefor it is yours. If you do get sued, I'm confident you will win."
bn1y03,"NAH, nothing wrong with her asking a question politely, nothing wrong with your polite answer.  Don't overthink it."
bn1ygx,"YTA. I think you’re looking at things the wrong way. WHY do you have time to spend on your hobbies so often and she doesn’t have anytime to spend on hers? Hobbies naturally take a back seat when you have a kid, and I’m wondering why you are getting space to yourself to do yours so much more often than she is. I think y’all should look into both parring down your stuff and combining it into one room."
bn1zjl,NTA that dog could seriously hurt someone. Your neighbor is being irresponsible.
bn29gv,"This is a hard one.  I'd say NAH because what you want to do is noble, but it's really stupid.  You already have 4 people living in a three bedroom apartment.  that's already ridiculously cramped, especially since people are already sharing rooms.  Add a stranger into the mix and it just adds to so much trouble.  I think you are a bit naive to think that this is a good idea.  I understand that it's your friend but you have already taken the responsibility of taking care of you family. 

Also your girlfriend is definitely not the asshole here.  I would be weirded out too if my boyfriend completely inconvenienced himself for another girl.  Would you give your room up for a male friend in the same situation?"
bn2aa8,"YTA. Either find less douchey friends, or find a boyfriend who your douchey friends approve of. But don't ask him to cater to your friends."
bn2aip,"YTA. Yes, I think you should drop your plans to be by his side. Even if he's not hoping for it or expecting you to do it, it's a huge gesture of support."
bn2al7,[deleted]
bn2jpd,"YTA. I know it's irrational, and you know it's irrational. I really don't think your wife wanting to look pretty to more people than just you is something that should bug you on such a level. You guys seem to have good communication skills, which is great.

More or less, this is all super dumb, and I personally think you need to get over your lipstick phobia, but I also respect you for being self-aware.

I hope you two can figure out a solution to this strange issue."
bn2lye,"NTA. Even if he didn't have autism, he still wouldn't understand until he is taught. That's how you teach kids. You tell them over and over and over until they do understand. Your sister is not doing her son any favors by letting him do whatever he wants and using his autism as an excuse."

bn2on7,"NTA -  that’s not really how gift giving works.   It’s not really a gift when you tell someone they have to give you something.  Also expecting one in return isn’t a good reason to give a gift,  you may as well just go buy yourself something."

MAJORLY

First off, you know how many kids would give their left foot to have a mom that worried enough about them to not only go get you some more medicine, but then bring you some at school. 

Give me a break, and I hope you realize how great you have it and appreciate the things that she does. Often times we take it for granted until it’s too late and our moms are gone forever. So open your eyes. My god."
bn3652,"NTA, but I wouldn't say anything. It's not going to solve anything, and will just breed drama. Now you know where you stand with her. Think about this when considering your relationship with her in the future."
bn36xe,NTA. Bleach is dangerous. Accidents with bleach are dangerous. You gave her plenty of chances to fix her habit of forgetting.
bn3cj7,[deleted]
bn3crr,"NTA

She is treating you, at best, as incompetent and untrustworthy when it comes to your own son.

Telling your husband to lie to you or go behind your back is unacceptable. (Not that this is her only wrongdoing, but this really stuck out to me)"
bn3drl,[deleted]
bn3ewo,NTA. They can spend the $$ they didn’t spend on your meal to pay for a dog sitter.
bn3fos,NTA. When he has a job are you going to show up there to do his work for him too? He needs to learn this shit.
bn3ike,"YTA

Communication is a two way street. If you haven't made the effort to stay in contact enough to know he had a gf, he doesn't owe you a personal message to tell you he's having a child with that gf."

bn3jxd,"NAH. The two of you failed to communicate with one another, it happens."
bn3kmc,"NTA, violence isn’t the answer, but I do think it’s more of a big deal then your family is making it that he was dishonest about the money. I would have a discussion with your brother without your boyfriend for sure."
bn3l0r,"NTA

Driving under the Influence of anything is a crime and he will eventually hurt or kill someone doing it, maybe even himself."
bn3mnm,">Does he get OT? Of course not. His boss “banks” those hours for the short weeks—he never gets 1.5 pay. 

This is so incredibly illegal it's nuts, and, not to be mean, your fiancée is a moron for accepting this.

NTA"
bn3ocr,"NTA, personally I think you should tell her, or at least tell your wife and her family to get this dude more therapy to work out the anger issues. This could be a huge issue and a lot of the time divorce isn't seen as an option in Indian culture, so she could end up as sort of stuck in an abusive situation if she is not very independent. (source: I am Indian American and have tons of family back in India so I am familiar with some of the cultural aspects)"
bn3ohk,"YTA.  As it doesn't effect you directly (other than her being rude to you occasionally), it's not your business what she does with her time.  Yes, it feels like a waste of time to you, but no one has the right to dictate the rights or wrongs of another person's life."
bn3t6l,"NTA

But man, a shitty situation to say the least in deciding what to do. Maybe he'sin an open relationship, maybe hes a scumbag, maybe this, maybe that. Maybe you tell her and she gets mad at *you*. Maybe she would want to know, maybe she wouldn't. Everyone is different.

If you decide to tell her, screenshots of conversations, Facebook message, reaffirm that you didn't know until now."
bn3v4b,"Honestly, I’ve learned the hard way people are never “too busy”. If they really truly care, they make time."
bn3zdo,YTA. Your father played favorites and didn't treat your brother right. Now karma is catching up to him. Your brother is doing more than enough by even offering to pay half the costs. You are not entitled to his money.
bn48lx,"YTA, not for giving money to your ex but for lying to your current spouse."
bn4b2i,NTA - Dogs can be therapeutic but if Alex can’t afford to pay rent then Alex SHOULD NOT get a dog. It isn’t fair to you or to the dog. What if the dog gets sick and needs expensive treatment? Even a regular trip to the vet for flea meds and vaccines can be pricey. You have been very fair and said that you are on board for a dog if Alex gets a job and starts contributing.
bn4f7n,"Yta, I love dogs. My little buddy is my best friend, but I got everyone I lived with to agree to me getting him first. Because even if you and your mother are the one's doing most of the work, he's still going to have to deal with living with this dog. He'll love it eventually I'm sure, most people would. But it's still unfair of you to force him into accepting a pet he doesn't want."
bn4o0o,"NAH.

I know this is tough but after a devastating injury and severe medical trauma, I can understand why your sister is angry. I'm not sure how well she is functioning physically and mentally if it's a brain injury, so I don't think she is an asshole-asshole, she may be in a lot of pain and experienced a great deal of loss. That said, I can also understand why you'd need your distance. I'm all for putting up boundaries if you need them. Is there a happy medium between a little distance and no contact altogether? A way to keep your emotional health safe and also not cause additional pain to your family."
bn4ocz,NTA tell your husband about it so he can tell him not to text you
bn4q03,"NTA

But certainly not fair. Some people enjoy watching something to discover things about the story together because that makes it a bonding experience. If you already know the plot and the ending I’m sure that spoils the feeling. If binge reading is the hobby you enjoy there’s no shame in it, but exercising restraint to stay at the same story beats as your partner will be more satisfying, I think you’ll find. 

For example, watch a few episodes together and then read up to the point that you left off in the show. Then you can have discussion with him about what’s different between the books and the show and you preserve experiencing the show together instead of the lopsided way y’all do it now."
bn4qv6,"NAH but only because, as you said, they don’t test men for HPV. How was he supposed to know he had a disease they wouldn’t have tested him for in a normal STD screening?"
bn4t5d,NTA but very close to the Asshole :O
bn4tkr,NTA. No one should be stuck with a redpiller.
bn4u8w,"YTA - kind of, good intentions however....

&#x200B;

That company has quite a few lawsuits under their belt. Not saying everyone in the company is bad, but there is some controversy with negligence, death of animals etc. so to protect yourself you should definately of asked for permission first from the owner."
bn4v6r,"NAH It doesn’t matter if it does or not. If she feels more comfortable doing so, let her do it. Kindly redirect articles to her if you really want to, but don’t expect her to change her mind."
bn4vp0,NTA your sister probably shouldn't own a dog.
bn502h,NTA. Your friends are being shits
bn51ex,"NTA. Call animal control and any other possible agency ASAP.

PLEASE CALL THE AUTHORITIES! These furkids need you to be their hero!"
bn52x3,"NTA 

I’m Hindu too! But even though I still abide by the  restrictions, I don’t think you’re in the wrong here. It’s not a religion you’ve accepted and not something you relate to and you’re free to make your own choices."
bn53nk,"NAH, no one wants to be at the DMV. However, no one wants to wait there alone either."
bn55og,"NAH - mistakes don't make you TA.  He's not one either because at 16 you should be able to get yourself up and packed.  He probably hoping you'll learn the lesson of being more responsible by missing the trip which is why he didn't wake you and that you shouldn't take it for granted you'll always have a ride and/or someone to wake up.

 You made a mistake, experienced the consequences, should be the end of it - NAH."
bn5606,NTA. Why your mother would be upset about this is mystifying. It logically makes the most sense when you don’t have an SO or children to leave it to your brother.
bn578e,"YTA - Just to be clear, you didn't see anything and have no evidence? Just heard sounds while you were so drunk that you laid down in grass?

Gotta keep it to yourself unless you have some sort of evidence."
bn581u,"NTA you explained the situation in a clear way, she was fine with it. Now she’s changing her mind. If she does leave you good fuckin riddance"
bn58dm,NTA he isn’t paying for anything so it’s not his. If you don’t want to share it I don’t seem why you’d have to.
bn59wu,"I mean it doesn’t sound like she has much of an option or choice here. I get you don’t like him but it seems like you can’t help her the way she needs so she’s stuck with him. 

I’m also confused as to why he would go off on you out of the blue. I feel like you’re leaving something out. Like there’s a history of drama between you two that friend A doesn’t share and you’re expecting her to give up the help she needs over it. 

But yeah friend A is probably right that it’s not her problem. It sounds like you two have drama and she’s just trying to get by as best she can.

ESH except friend A."
bn5aoi,"Mooooooove out

NAH"
bn5cal,"NTA. Carrying the emotional burden of a dying relative is hard. I currently have a grandmother who's been surviving, not living, *surviving,* in assisted care for the past 8 years. She can't even remember her name most days. I really just want her to die so she, and all of her relatives can get off the emotional roller-coaster that is watching a once-proud woman drop down to 85 pounds and shit herself twice a day."
bn5dl7,"NTA. 

She has no respect for your safety, pleasure or sense of self. Why would she think you'd WANT to travel (especially assuming you're taking time off work, paying for it...) to a place where you're going to be scared and on edge the entire time?

She sounds super self centered.

“Karen, I want to apologize for calling you a c\*\*\*. I shouldn’t have used that language. I do not apologize for the sentiment behind it. I stand by my belief that you were out of line to shame your son for his sexuality, and I suggest you apologize to him before you lose him.”"
bn5ghh,NTA that's a pretty standard pizza tip. It's not really the same as waitress tipping and is extra annoying when the order isnt complete.
bn5hw7,"No you are definitely NTA! (Argh this attitude from him makes me so angry!!)  You should say you need to get into work early one morning to give him an idea of how difficult it is to get the kids out the door and how much you deal with every morning!  In a two parent household, there should be an even distribution of work. If he can’t wake up early, he can help make lunch the night before. If he can, he should help the kids get ready in the morning. 

I ran into this issue with the arrival of my second child; when I attended an out-of-state conference for a few days, I think that’s when my husband realized how uneven the morning responsibilities were."
bn5ih3,NTA. Cheaters deserve to be outed.
bn5ijh,"NTA, your sister is frankly not responsible enough to own any pet let alone a puppy in need of training. Especially if she isn't paying for it at all."
bn5q69,"NTA, it was really just adding to the horse droppings that were already there. 

What’re you gonna do? Pick up the part of the pile that only belonged to your dog? 

That’d be silly. If it wasn’t RIGHT ON TOP of the horse pile, then it’d be a different story. But for all anybody else knows, it was all just one big horse shit."
bn5r7v,"NTA.

He's being absurdly inconsiderate. Why not invite you and make it a double celebration?"
bn5typ,"YTA, but if not now, in some years you actually have to be honest with them about their dad. It is harsh but they need to know how things are so they can be more conscious about their decisions.

Also, work on yourself. Stop self loathing and become the strong woman your kids want to see. You are able to stand up on your own, without being shadowed by your ex husband."
bn5ucf,"NAH. It sounds like you're in a relationship that isn't working for you. 

It's not your fault that he's working the hours that he is (unless he's doing so to help pay for mutual expenses, etc. If so, ignore my comment). It's also not inherently an asshole move for him to be doing that. If you've found that you can't have a sustainable relationship with things the way they are, something is eventually going to have to give. Reasonably, that means his job changes, you decide you can live with it, or you will need a break from your relationship. It's ultimately your call, but I don't think taking a break makes you an asshole."
bn5wtj,"NTA

Your house, your rules. Plus the guy sounds like a jerk."
bn62w6,"NTA and calling him buddy or bro for the remainder  of the project is acceptable

Edit : repaired spelling"
bn66vm,"NTA. Group projects suck, especially when people don't pull their weight. G1 should have said something if she felt overloaded."
bn6bsw,YWBTA. This isn’t your battle to fight and would probably make things worse for your girlfriend. Sounds like your girlfriend needs to find a new place to live.
bn6hen,"NTA. She sounds like a monster of a person to date and you don't ""owe"" anyone your friendship."
bn6jf6,"NTA.  You did your cousin a solid, which was awesome of you.  But you don't have any obligation beyond medical info... which your cousin should know already since you donated sperm."
bn6lic,"YTA.  What is he able to do for you that you cant do for yourself? He cant make you less sick, he cant make you stop shitting, he cant make this go away.  You are going to feel the same level of sickness whether hes there or not.  The only thing him staying with you is going to do is prevent him from spending time with his mother on her special day before you guys move"
bn6mdz,"ESH

You’re smothering her. If she takes her time between responding, she’s busy. You’re constantly pushing to start conversations, even if she hasn’t responded in a day or two.

That said, she should tell you if you’re being a pain. Kindly. Shit talking you is a lousy way to indirectly resolve her problem.

Honestly, if you’re the one always initiating, she’s just not that into you.  Give her some room to breathe"
bn6mrk,"NTA. They're the ones endangering lives. They've already got the road and now trying to mow down pedestrians.

Better your hands slapping the hood than a body."
bn6o8b,"NTA kids and dog may need help but even if everything is fine, still acceptable to call. Where I live there are by-laws against noise and it’s not police but City employees who deal with it. Fines are good deterrents. 

I feel for kids and dogs who may have a crappy life though :("
bn6q0b,"YTA - Not for not wanting to be in the car if your niece is driving (that's fine, I don't like being driven around by my nieces either since they are both lousy drivers) but for telling her mother that while she was also in the room.  You should have spoken privately to your sister about your concerns."
bn6rwn,"NAH - In his 70’s, I’m surprised you haven’t already had a POA set up since he’s started losing lucidity. As far as taking the keys however, it’s definitely time. It’s always better to do these things sooner rather than later for the exact reason your husband gave: he will not take this well. Your father isn’t in his right mind and he’s not going to think about what you’re doing rationally; it’s clear that in his mind he’s done nothing wrong and he will feel wrongfully punished. It’s not going to be a pretty conversation, but if he was literally lost for most of the day and didn’t think to call anybody, he needs assistance. Don’t let the anger dismay you, you are doing what’s best for him at the end of the day."
bn6ys7,"NTA 

assuming that this isn’t something you bring up constantly, it seems like a reasonable statement and your soon to be ex is disproportionately acting the asshole here.

bn743m,NTA as long as it's set up with proper child restraints. Sounds like a fun time before kindergarten starts!
bn7608,"From my perspective, YTA.

&#x200B;

Discounting your wife's opinion as ""insane"".

Valuing your mother's opinion more than hers.

Unilaterally making the decision.

Start with a coffee, not an entire summer."
bn7bu9,"YTA if you do that. It’s way overstepping bounds and would embarrass her and be creepy. At most, mention your thoughts to your girlfriend and suggest she talk to her."
bn7c6t,"NTA!!! So very sorry he’s trying to pull you into the mix. He needs a therapist and it’s not supposed to be you! You have every right to stand up for yourself and feel angry and hurt by his words. Their divorce is their deal, and if he’s let himself get so wrapped up in it it’s warping his perception, while painful af to you, it does not mean you should carry any guilt over being honest with your feelings. Easier said than done I know, but you can’t fix this for him or your mom and I’m sorry for the mess you have to deal with."
bn7d84,"NTA. Given what you've said about his feelings about her, there's no way he would've left it to her had he had a will, so you're honoring his wishes in the absence of one. She has no right to it. If she needed closure on their relationship, that's something she should've pursued over the last 20 years; it's not your responsibility to give it to her now."
bn7p19,"NTA if you get the funds to him before the due date. It was his choice to pay the bill early. Even if that is what he always does. Unless you guys had an agreement to pay it sooner, totally NTA."

bn7zvj,"NTA - As a wise man once said: ""bros before hoes""."
bn84l9,"NTA- but for the grandmother part, you need to think if you will regret your actions when she is gone. No she’s not the same person, but she cannot help that. If you can, I’d make an effort to see her. My grandmother passed away with full blown dementia, she did not have a clue who anyone was, but I would regret not visiting her before she died and telling her how I felt about her, even if she had no clue it happened."
bn89ey,"YTA. Why didn’t you listen to your mom? She probably has good reasons to want to stay out of your uncles troubles. Idk what country you live in, but for some reason I feel nervous for you guys."
bn8bdb,"NTA - While his religion is important to him, that doesn't mean you automatically have to carry his work burdens for him. I would be complaining to management about the situation, it's nothing against his religion - it's about your personal well-being."
bn8dcv,"NTA - you don’t have to have this woman involved in your wedding, or indeed even invite her if she is really so terrible.  You don’t have to include her in your life at all."
bn8gwu,[deleted]
bn8m5v,"YTA. I get being annoyed, but it's completely natural for people to be interested in their heritage. You don't get to just revoke her ancestry. And blowing up at people in public when they haven't actually attacked you in any way is an asshole move in general. Not liking someone does not justify that behavior. If you must be a dick about it, pull her aside and do it privately, at least.

If you yell at someone to the point they run crying from the bar, you're an asshole even if you had valid points."
bn8qpk,"YTA - going to an authoritarian/corrupt country comes with ground rules. You have to follow them or else you can really end up getting in some trouble, even if they seem abusive and unreasonable. These countries don't have the rule of law that would protect you in most western democracies.

What puts it over the line is that you connected yourself with your friend - potentially putting them or their family at risk. Pretty irresponsible."
bn8qwb,"NTA, you didn't even make her leave. You just asked her to stop complaining if she wants to stay. It sounds like it was pretty obvious that it wasn't a convening of the academy selection committee."
bn8ul3,NTA. For the reasons everyone else has mentioned. It may be hard to enforce if the family and family friends are used to BYOBing. It'll be especially hard if your parents or someone else is hosting. Just a caution.
bn9gs3,NTA - these people don’t sound like friends at all.
bn9h25,NAH - it is normal for grief to fade with time and also to reassess relationships as you grow older and face new aspects of your own life.
bn9ia1,NTA - I'd be livid in your situation.  Why does your husband allow this to continue?  Why doesn't he stand up for his wife and tell his mother that her behaviour is not on?
bn9j6l,"NTA - if you believe you have a condition, there’s nothing wrong with seeking support and guidance from family and professionals."
bn9n0k,"NAH, but if experience is the only edge the white male candidate has, bare in mind that the black woman may never be afforded the same opportunities to gain experience as him. You are making a choice based on merit, but this woman is looking for anyone to take a chance on her. It isn't your job, but you know the odds aren't in her favour."

bn9vps,NTA - money mismanagement AND trying to hide it? wew lad.
bn9vtz,"ESH It was deeply inappropriate and unethical for you to look at that group chat. Sure, you had your friend's permission to look through the phone, but your friend did not have the right to violate other people's privacy like that. Which also makes your friend an asshole in that regard. Complaining indirectly but not addressing the actual problem is pretty bad too on the part of the girl. It's almost like everyone in this story is immature. Which, I'm guessing is the actual problem. You're probably all young. Well, doing immature things while young is the way of life, so hopefully you will all outgrow it. Oh yeah, it says eighth grade was last school year... so I guess everyone sucks here, but probably pretty normal levels of drama and suck for your ages."
bn9xu8,"NTA - effort in a friendship is a two way street. If you’re the only one putting it in, you’re a doormat."
bna0fe,"YTA
You told him to come and you would handle the rest. Why have him set up a trip for two weeks then act like that. Traveling in general is time consuming and tiring. One could argue that you knew what you were getting into and because of that.. the way youre acting by leaving him alone makes you the asshole"
bna1sn,YTA - I’m glad you’re aware of it without needing others to tell you. Pretend the roles were reversed and he got into a mood with you because you didn’t put out. How to fix it? Apologise.
bna3vr,NTA Your kid. Your rules. Your justification is rational and noble. It's good you see where shes coming from. It's strictly not her child though.
bna3zs,"You will be the asshole if you don't tell him. Tell him and explain what happened and how you handled it. If he's a good partner, he will understand and you two can get through this. If he isn't, you are better off learning that sooner rather than later. If you don't tell him then it becomes a secret. A dangerous secret some people know and can use against you. Something that will make him wonder why you didn't tell him. Something that will weigh on you, making you wonder what will happen if it gets out. Avoid all that and just tell him."
bna6tf,Wtf did i just read?
bna7p2,YWNBTA - why is she feeding a cat fucking olive oil? Is your cats name Popeye?
bna7vj,"NTA. I’m of the opinion that you’re right and twerking is inherently sexual, especially if she’s only in underwear, which gets worse when you say everyone in the chat is underage so now not only is she posting child porn but she’s distributing pornography to minors. STA."

bnb57v,"NTA

This is a deal breaker for me. If I spend the time and effort to be there with you, then I want your attention. I don't want to sit there watching you play games on your phone, tweeting, IG'ing, taking, texting someone else. It's so incredibly rude and it's hurtful to the person who's there to visit with you.

I think you could mention it once, something like ""hey, do you want to hang out another time? You seem distracted with your phone friends"" or something like that. If he's ""oh sorry dude, I'm just all over the place, let's go do xyz together"" and is attentive the rest of the time, then you got your point across. If he argues with you, or stops for that time but does it the next, then each time you get together and he starts getting on his phone or whatever, just quietly get up and leave. If he notices and says ""hey, where are you going?"" just say ""you look busy and I've got other stuff to do"" or something like that. Do this every time it happens until he either gets the hint or you just stop hanging out because he's selfish and rude."
bnb6bf,NTA. I'm guessing Paris?
bnb6oz,"If you can gather absolute proof, then YWNBTA. Anything else is a bad idea and best kept to yourself."

bnbije,"NTA, you can't help someone who won't help themselves."
bnbkt8,"NAH. If it's important to you and you can do it as part of a respectful discussion (since you value her friendship) then of course you should tell her how you feel. 

I might be tone-deaf (I'm not American) but it sounds like she probably wasn't trying to be racist and wasn't thinking of the bigger picture when she made that comment. It sounds like simple jealousy, though it would probably help to unpack why she equates ""length"" with ""best"".

That said, it might be a good idea to have your conversation with her after Best Hair so that you're not caught up in the emotion of that, and so that if it does turn sour, it won't ruin your time winning Best Hair.

bnc48y,"Tough one but I think NTA.The mother is understandably annoyed that you’re using the kitchen a lot, and even if it states you’re allowed to use the kitchen, using it a lot to make popcorn often at night etc might interfere with them more than they would like. However, I don’t think you’re an asshole for using the kitchen like that, since no terms were agreed beforehand. She is still letting you use the kitchen which is fair and doesn’t technically breach the contract, but not letting you get water is a step too far, it’s a basic need.

bnc6en,"YWBTA - petty, just like your title says."
bncdre,[deleted]
bnceag,"NTA, based on the way you tell the story those people are insufferable and extremely entitled. They gave no right to impede your experience because they decided to bring their kid."
bnckba,"NAH. I feel like you need to stop worrying about other people so much and think about what you want. How have you always pictured your wedding day? I’m a people-pleaser myself so I relate to this post on a very uncomfortable level, but sometimes it’s a good thing to put yourself first. Starting a life with the mother of our child sounds like a good time to do this."
bnclef,"NTA

Run. Breaking plates at 27 over things like this is a red flag the size of mars my man. If any other part of your relationship reflects this behavior, I’m concerned for your well being."
bncmcx,"NAH. You need to talk to him about how you feel. He probably has no idea you feel left out, and probably has very good reasons for not explicitly inviting you. For instance, he might be assuming that you know you are always welcome, or think you’re too busy since it’s the end of your scholarship period. Just let him know!"
bncoyr,NTA - they see it as harmless while the average person hearing those conversations would be very taken aback or even disgusted. The fact that those things upset you shows that you are normal and not a total piece of shit.
bncs6f,"NTA. It's your company, you get to make the harsh decisions. You even said that you're going to avoid other friends and family to avoid this situation. She won't die without money, if she has to work at McDonald's so be it. If you don't like her, don't hire her."

bnctd5,"ESH

&#x200B;

He's an asshole according to you.  I'll take that at face value.  If you had invited half the students, or a third of the students, or even 2/3s of the students, you would be fine not inviting him.  Inviting everyone \*but\* him, however, definitely shows you didn't take the higher road.  So, I'm going to say that this fits into ""petty revenge"", which also makes you an asshole."
bncv7o,NTA.. I think you hit the nail on the head when you said your parents don't accept your partner. I bet if you were in a heterosexual relationship they would help watch your son during this scenario. It sounds as if they are trying to make it hard on you to be there for your partner.
bnd106,NTA but what prompts the arguments? Does she just call you and shout at you?
bnd3uw,"NAH But I would recommend instead asking him to help you  think about things that might make this easier on you, rather than directly asking him to help. Maybe him helping is the way to go. Maybe you can afford to pay for some help sometimes for you. If you are living comfortably, maybe you could cut some corners here or there and have a maid service come in once a month or something. Maybe you two have family that could help. Basically, if you approach it as, this is too much, what can we do to make this more workable, and then talk and listen to each other, it's good."
bndglp,"NTA.

Your mother is enabling his behavior. Just because he might have psychological problems, doesn’t mean he can’t be held accountable. She isn’t doing him any favors by excusing his behavior- all it is doing is allowing him to think his behavior is acceptable.

Things get complicated when family is involved. People put on blinders. It doesn’t seem like your uncle would have any positive influence on your life, which should be what matters when it comes to being in your life- not whether you share some DNA."
bndkgs,You telling your parents to fuck off might be unnecessarily rude but I wouldn't say you're an asshole for it. Your dad shouldn't be there without asking you beforehand (it seems he might have just imagined talking to you but I really wouldn't know) and you're obviously not comfortable with either of your parents being there. I'd just politely send them away.
bndkzg,"NTA. He did the damage, and it's not your fault if you cannot or even simply will not get over it. You are under no obligation to accept an apology, even from family. That said, you have listed three different pschological disorders; what I suggest you do is talk over the issue with your therapist, and see what you two can come up with. What I'm saying is that you should do what's in your best interests here, and you two should work out what that might be."
bndn3g,"NAH. What you are doing is being paid for standby. It's not an uncommon situation.

Now, what should you do about it? Thing is, some people get bored. If you feel that way, just call your boss and ask for extra assignments. If you don't, well, that's fine. It's their nickel."
bndnf3,"You asked and I'll answer.

I might get downvoted to Hell for the YTA vote, but while I don’t think you intentionally were an ah, in that scenario that’s how the room read you. As someone too busy to be polite for 20 seconds and instead had to race off ahead of everyone who were showing respect."

bne4r2,NTA and holy fuck her parents are toxic

They are extremely overreacting and causing harm to your mental health even more than before. I would suggest trying to ignore them until the baby comes. I have a feeling trying to discuss this with them will cause more health problems

bne7l0,NTA. I’ve done it with no one around at times because there’s always the possibility there’s someone nearby with a camera or something else. You really can’t be too safe.

Holy shit, you have 5 pets in a 400 sqft apartment.

Your wording ""like any old person on the planet"".  Sounds like the issue is more you than your mother.  People vent to one another when they are grown ups - you have it easy - you are living at home free of charge and you are not being forced to pay rent, just listen to your mom vent once in a while, and you have an issue with that?"
bnemoi,"NTA. Your friend sounds like they are in serious trouble, and you did something you reasonably expected could help them.

bnersj,"I sometimes ask my wife how much longer food will take to cook, not because I'm impatient or trying to be a jerk I just would like a rough estimate to see what time I should expect to be ready for dinner if it's soon, I'll prepare the table or wrap up what I'm doing. If it's a long time I'll go do something else and I make it a habit of asking if she would like help with anything and she almost always says no. I think you're overreacting."
bneso5,How are you friends with a guy for 23 years without knowing when his birthday is lmao?
bnetek,NTA. If you don't wanna be her friend then you don't have to
bneuso,"NTA.  She's the one creating a non-conventional sleep atmosphere.  And even if you wore earplugs, the brightness is still an issue for you, right?  If it were solvable with just you wearing earplugs then I would say bite the bullet and do it."
bnevg1,NTA and I'd recommend calling someone to get those cats out of there. Poor things must be malnourished and if she catches you no one else my be able to help them.
bneyie,"NTA. IF you're being quiet, I can't understand why your sister would have a problem with you being in the living room, which is shared space."

you would rather your child work a minimum wage job for the rest of his life than for you to pay for his college when you clearly have the funds? sounds to me like you don't really like your son."

bnf9gf,Okay well IDK about being the asshole but I would also be pissed off if my boyfriend suddenly starts hanging out with his old sex buddy and then giving her the same gift as me lmao
bnfcp1,"NTA.  

You get to be involuntary babysitter while she decides she doesn't feel like being present for her children then gets mad when you tell them enough is enough, calmly? Hell outta here with that shit (not you OP, her)."
bnfimm,NAH. Those things are nasty. I think leaving him to take care of it is fine. Marriage is about sharing equal responsibility and all that. So next time there’s a nest of critters then op’s got it...right?
bnfjwm,NTA. Contact the other mom and get her to submit her sworn statement to the police station. The state shouldn't take long to close the case. Just stay on top of it.

bnfu4o,"YTA

You were not betrayed or cheating on. You two broke up. She can be with whoever she wants and has no obligation to even share that with you.

And for unsolicited advice, having this much contact with her when it's clear that you still care for her that way is a terrible way to try and move on."

bnfz48,"NAH

I get it why your parents were afraid you getting a job, maybe they were preoccupied you would relapse into your bad habits, but i totally get your point, money is important in ones independency. Maybe next time try to communicate better with your parents, explain why you want a job and what fears they might have"
bnfzdp, NTA it’s your right to decline her offer. You know you don’t like her particular service and that’s fine.
bng309,I’m going to go with NAH. You’re grieving and have a lot on your plate right now so it is understandable that you didn’t get around to telling your family. But your family is also allowed to be hurt because they missed you getting married.
bng5vx,"NTA. Agree completely with your logic. Sure, the other scenario is not impossible, but IMO yours is the more likely scenario."
bng9zp,"NTA Even setting aside whether they should expect you to accomodate them, planning on showing up with zero notice is a dick move. Adding to that it's not even you or a hotel if they have other relatives to stay with."
bngh87,"YTA - Just because you have enough money to support the baby doesn’t mean she WANTS the baby. She said herself that she isn’t emotionally ready. If you want to break up with her here, fine go ahead, that isn’t the problem. The problem is that you’re trying to pressure her into keeping a baby she isn’t ready for, and for that, you’re the asshole."
bngjte,"NTA. It's not like she made one comment and you blew up on her, she has spent a lot of time making rather insulting comments to you over a long period of time, that's just shitty. The fact that she actually cried after you fired back is just stupid. Also, your friends not saying anything about her fat shaming you while being mad at you for doing the opposite tells me you might need better friends. You rock whatever dress you want."
bngk33,NTA what she did was absolutely unforgivable
bngm2j,Nta. People are crazy if they think the next occupants will have the exact same taste.
bngngd,"NTA, sounds like you are trying to think of the best possible decision for you and being open-minded to other possibilities is not a bad thing. The CC could give you more options, not to mention it's cheaper so you'd save some money.

Your friend sounds like a bit of an AH because she can't accept that a lot of people do dumb things when they're younger, and learn from them and change. 

I think it's fair that you're upset about your bf's comment."
bngowp,I am torn on this one but I would lean towards yea YWBTA if you asked for them to return a tip. Clearly a mistake on them forgetting to ring in cheese and I think most places would just comp the mistake but taking the time to get them to return the previous transaction to take off the tip you gave already seems pretty petty.
bngqoo,"ESH  - except the cat

Todd is the asshole for repeatedly letting the cat out.  You are the asshole for involve the Po in your argument with Todd and are now paying a price since that backfired.  

&#x200B;

You saying that Todd caused you to lose the cat is not right because you are the one who brought the  ailurophobe  P.O. into an argument over the cat.  You kind of played yourself there, result was predictable.

bngt73,NTA she cheated on you and betrayed your trust. You don’t owe her anything
bngy6n,"NTA.  Just because someone birthed a person doesn't mean they get a lifetime free pass to be an abusive bully.  Being born doesn't enter someone into a lifetime contract of misery.  Keep sticking up for your wife, you are doing good."
bngyqm,"NAH.  I'm sorry, but it really sounds like you two aren't on the same page at all as to the future of your marriage.  You still want to make it work, he wants to move on.  He might have been a bit more tactful, but I really can't see a scenario where one or both you don't end up hurt and disappointed.  Sometimes there isn't a clear cut villian."
bngzbh,"I really dislike a lot of the comments so far, as well as the comments to come.

Losing a child is very similar to depression. It's an illness or a handicap.

This isn't some kind of Ayn Randian fantasyland where every man is fully actualised and responsible for their own success and shit.

There's no fucking guidebook on how to lose a child or grieve.

Jesus Christ people.

You're all the asshole.

OP, asking him to disclose something this painful is like asking a quadriplegic to go up the stairs to the Statue of Liberty. It's possible with a bunch of help, but it can't be done easily.

You are absolutely TA if you don't go fucking fight on this guy's behalf to get him whatever he needs to be successful.

Perhaps I feel worse because it happened around Mother's Day. I can also see how she might have felt ganged up on, by my mother and I. I feel like I can't tell how much of an asshole I am because I'm too close to the situation.  I appreciate her wanting to celebrate achievements, but it's always her way."

bnh68g,NTA. It's mother's day. Your kids should celebrate it with their mother.
bnh76t,"NTA. Listen, Jobs are important—but your mental health and well-being are more important. Nothing is more aggravating than dealing with managers who take the job waaayyy too seriously, putting the tasks above employees who do care about their work and exploit that. Accidents happen, and you did your part in terms of reaching out to HR. And even if she did fire you, it’s not as bad as you may think. You have good cause for leaving, and you could easily explain the situation to a new employer (most places that call you in for an interview try and give the employee the benefit of the doubt if you’re up front about why you were let go). Make sure you get a reference from one of the other managers if you can."
bnh8qs,"ESH

There’s nothing wrong with being friends. But I have a feeling you know you’re kind of crossing a line you wouldn’t like being crossed if you were the gf. The guy should know better as well than to be that close to someone he knows has a crush on him. 
Y’all are skating on some thin ice. So maybe let the relationship cool off before Pursuing anything with him. He might be trying to distance himself from you to support his relationship. Let him make the calls for now."

bnhk26,"**YTA,** say""excuse me"" and be patient. You let your dog ask them to move instead of doing it yourself? You sound like a child."
bnhlil,"NTA.

bnhmfa,"YTA. He is a bit because of his comment about you never having faced racism, but that's only a drop compared to your bucket of dickishness. 

You seem very bitter about him getting into Yale while you had a better score than him (I'm not American, I assume ACT is just the test score you ended school with right?), but if I'm not mistaken a lot more goes into getting into a school like Yale than just scores and race. You have no real reason to believe that is what happened (in contrast to, for instance, him *nailing* his interview for it). You just sound racist."
bnhp74,"NTA. But if you consider him as a friend, why don't you tell him?"
bnhsav,"NTA

bni5p1,"NTA No you aren't an asshole. You were in an abusive relationship with mental health issues. Is like being mad at someone for not being able to walk. Those fears make sense. But go for it anyway. I'm sure they are going to be happy to have you back. Try to be honest about how you feel and how sorry you are. They are going to understand and worst case scenario, if they don't, you can move on and find better friends. Just be honest and open about what happened, I'm sure they love you enough to understand."
bni6eq,"NTA, and you need to kick both of these leeches to the curb"
bni6pu,"I’m between everyone and no one in this case. It sounds like a super toxic friendship regardless. She feels possessive and entitled to your friendship while you try to use the little money you have to buy hers. The photo album sounds like a really sweet gesture and I am sorry she treated it that way. The unequal valentines gifts make this seem like maybe she is into you or vice versa? Either way, you should talk it out in a respectful way if you want to save this relationship and accept that things cannot continue as they are going."
bni79o,NTA and it's sounding like you should be contacting some sort of authority if they're stealing your disability money.

bniyso,"Argh! Yes you would be an asshole. You are only worrying about your sister endangering herself because you were a douche/risky online when you were younger.

Instead of snooping through her computer, start talking to her about what she does online, warn her about the creepy people she could meet and tell her if she does meet someone who asks her to do sketchy or explicit things to block them. Tell her you have her back and that you will help her if anyone bothers her online, judgment free. That means you support her even if she does something stupid like send someone a nude. 

If you have any real reason to believe your sister is being exploited online then please tell your parents. I couldn’t blame you for snooping if she was suddenly acting weird but the best way is to approach her like an equal and ask her if anything is wrong. Build a relationship with her.

I had a really good relationship with one of my older brothers because he talked to me but if he had snooped on my computer I would have become enraged and would never have spoken to him again.

Become friends with your sister! Talk to her!"

bnj290,YWBTA- no question. Have a talk with him instead. Kiddo is in no way comparable to fatass. Don’t be that asshole who bodyshames someone in order to make yourself feel better.
bnj4vj,"I'm gonna go against the grain and say YTA, its lying by omission, and looking at your post history too...

Also going a little more into your posts... You've cheated on every single relationship you've been in? Holy shit YTA"
bnj6f4,"NTA, she is, mostly because she offered to stop it, you took her up on that offer, and then she continued, and lied about it. This is a massive breach of trust and you have every right to be upset about it.

Are you an asshole for asking her to stop in the first place? I don't believe so, but many would disagree with me. I don't think it's unreasonable to not want your partner to have active, ongoing contact with their exes. Whether they need to adhere to those wishes is another thing entirely, but there's nothing wrong with not wanting them to and telling them that. But what she did isn't that. She lied. That's fucked up."
bnjb15,"I actually don't think you're in the wrong here, although you're extremely naive, if she'll cheat with you, she'll cheat on you. However, you're not actively trying to get with her from the sounds of it, so NTA"
bnjce2,"Wow. Massive red flag alert on that first paragraph. That's super fucked up and one of the most obvious signs of an abusive relationship there. 

I want to say YTA based on the actual question/situation though. In the end you've made decisions with him about this and while the relationship is fucked up, going behind his back to do things you know he wouldn't approve of is shitty of you. Either tell him and do it, or don't do it.

But seriously, this sounds like a super unhealthy relationship. If you really want to make this work you really should be investing in some couples therapy."

bnjks4,"NTA assuming you put up boundaries and he's crossing them, which seems to be the situation here.

bnm32p,"NAH, I can definitely see your perspective but mental illness skews perspective and what you think is tiny or unimportant is clearly a massive deal for her. Telling her these things aren't worth crying about won't make her have some kind of revelation. That will almost certainly just give her one more thing to be upset about.

You aren't obliged to stay with someone for any reason, and mental health issues are as valid a reason as any to leave. But staying with her is just as major a decision, and if you're going to do so then you might want to do some research into what she's dealing with so that you can empathise in a more appropriate way. It's clear that if you want to keep this relationship, you need to find a way to manage these times when she needs your emotional support. If you don't want to do that, then you should think twice about this commitment."
bnm3w2,"NTA a lot of red flags... he also keeps disrespecting your wishes about maintaining a friendship only relationship.

bnmycg,"NTA. Asking how long your boyfriend is staying for isn't really personal. Also, it may affect your friends. Eg they may worry that you're not online as much which can be important to them if they're gamers.

Your friend sounds pretty considerate considering he asked ""how do you feel about it"". Most people would assume you're excited.

Definitely, most people wouldn't consider how someone's staying as personal info. Now if he had asked what your bf is like in comparison.. that would be pushing it."

&#x200B;

But i wouldnt worry about confronting the best freind too much. Your priority should be talking to your girlfreind about the situation.

&#x200B;

If you basically go and complain to your best freind about his girlfreind that could cause alot of issues in your freindship. No one wants to choose between their best friend and their girlfreind. Not saying you shouldnt do it, but tread carefully.

&#x200B;

As i said, talk to your girlfriend. Explain that this girl is a little unbalanced. Warn her to be careful around her as it appears she loves to stir shit up. If your girlfriend is mature enough to understand the situation she wont put much stock in anything the crazy girls says and whenever she starts up you can both look at each other, smile, and roll your eyes"
bnn3tu,NAH. I get you love your dogs and your wife... But dude you can't take them everywhere with you guys. It will become very apparent when the baby arrives. Prepare yourself.

bnnsmr,"YTA.

You admit that you never spoke up for yourself while the trip was being planned, but are all surprised Pikachu that the activities of the trip revolved around the people who planned the trip rather than the person who didn't and who never voiced an opinion.

Planning, booking, and choosing activities all take time and mental energy. You didn't take part in any of that because you ""have a hard time speaking up for"" yourself. Your friends did all the work. You should be thanking them.

The one time the group planned an activity you wanted to do, you didn't inform them you were doing it. You made them wait for you.

Next time, get involved. It's not okay to hide behind ""but I can't speak up for myself.""

That's just an excuse."
bnnxpb,"NTA -- This is entirely unprofessional. You should be able to exchange funds for services without being worried about sexual/romantic advances. It really is that simple, and this guy should know better."
bnnzyh,"ESH. What a fucking mess.
First of all. Are you two in high school? Wanting to square up and fight each other like literal fucking children. And why? Where did that start? It all originated from a blunt. That all just literally sounds like a fight a bunch of children would have.

Second, your MIL is a major asshole LYING about both of your families to one another? And for what? For attention? Validation? To gossip? What's the point here. That just seems like middle school behaviour at its finest.

Are you sure you're all adults?"
bno3et,"NTA, it sounds like your neighbour very much overreacted. It is bad for the environment and Bluetooth can easily be transferred back to the phone but opening your car door to berate you and then slamming it shut when done is a violation of space and privacy (and potentially your safety)."
bno5l7,"I'm gonna bypass a judgment this time; honestly, this sounds like the two of you could use some counseling. You're living with a difficult mental disorder, and she's not coping with that well. You could use some help, and she could use some advice.

bno623,"NTA if you can’t handle the heat, stay out the kitchen"
bno6dc,"NTA this shit leads to separation anxiety and a bunch of other not-fun bullshit. You’re not supposed to rile your dog up when you get home, it creates a high energy point in their day and leads to misbehavior while they’re waiting for you to get home. You’re supposed to ignore the dog until it calms down and then interact with. I also have a little chihuahua which, while I love, can be a massive pain in my ass and her barking is grating. People think it’s fun to upset her and get her barking and reacting wildly to things then get confused when I get pissed off she’s misbehaving. This is not acceptable and you’re allowed to tell your sister to stop. 

If you have a private bedroom you can try to keep the dog in the room, refusing to let it out until it calms down but if your mother and sister still rile the dog up when it comes out then it’s a moot point. Explain your reasoning and continue to explain how dog behavior works until they hopefully get it."
bnobtp,"NTA - Be it alcohol, cracker jacks or pumpkin pie. If you don't have enough for everyone, you don't consume it. Just a basic rule I was raised-up under. 

Consuming any beverage or food while not offering the same to everyone who has gathering at your home is frankly rude.

Now is the time to get the answer to the questions you posted to us.  Does your boyfriend need alcohol in order to 'have fun' around others? 

Lifelong friends grow more precious as time passes. This evening may have given you just the right amount of 'feeling uncomfortable' to start discussing topics with your boyfriend that you two have been putting off or have not addressed. It may be like leveling-up in a life video game. In the meantime keep your friends  close."
bnof0y,"Uh... YTA for somehow managing to turn some poor girls being cheated on into it being about **YOU.**

You weren't betrayed, those girls were. The only way this could have been betrayal for you is if you had claim over her body which.... Ya don't. No one does.

You're not the victim here. You confessed and she didn't like you back. That's where it being about you stops. Those girls are the victims here.

Edit to add; Extra asshole points for finding out she was being cheated on and ""cutting her out"" in response. Your ""friend"" is being cheated on and you don't do anything to help them. Holy fuck."
bnofz9,"NTA, not by a long shot.
This ""friend"" hasn't respected your financial well being, and regardless of her shit, she should put you first, if you did her a solid.

Do you have proof of the loan? Texts and all? I'd start covering my ass, just in case. And you may even be able to take it to a small claims court.

Anyway, this person doesn't really seem like she's really a friend, not by your account anyway. You just have to be sure that you've said here is correct, and not an exaggeration. 
If so, get the money, and cut off all ties.

Because they have parents who know how to parent!! So people just expect you to put up with some strangers kid? Hell no!

You're biased against the guy and the new gf because of what happened between him and your friend, which is understandable. But you only know things from the side of your friend.

Everyone has a right to be happy, and it appears that those 2 have found it with each other. You giving them the stink eye from across the room isn't going to give them a sudden realization that they're not.

bnqagj,"ESH. He shouldn't have told you he'd stop talking to her if he didn't plan to. If they were talking about sex with eachother, that's inappropriate, if they talk about sex in general, it's not. Friends do that sometimes, and men seem to confide in women about relationship troubles for some reason. 

That being said, it sounds like you get this information through snooping, which is bad. You also shouldn't force people not to talk to people, let him make choices and if you're not okay with his choices figure out if it's a dealbreaker.

You’ve already said that he has trouble communicating, so it’s possible you took it wrong. Maybe he doesn’t have a good relationship with his family. Maybe he ditched a family event to hang out with you guys and thought he’d already told you that. Shit, maybe his family was abusive and they isolated him which is why he has no social skills. 

When it comes down to it, his social skills won’t get better until he has time to socialize. While that isn’t necessarily your responsibility, it would make you a good person if you were patient & openly asked him what he means by certain things. Explain how you took it, and ask what he meant. Then you can make your decision based on his answer.

There’s a lot of worse friends you can have than one that is maybe too honest and a little awkward. If he didn’t want friends, he wouldn’t be trying. It might take some work, but if you do become close, chances are he’d be the most loyal friend you’ve ever had."

That said, I'll tell you what I tell a lot of my students when it comes to graduation. It's absolutely your choice how you want to celebrate.

Original called for information:

I don’t understand how your behavior changes based on what you’ve shared which could make a big difference in who the asshole is here. It definitely sucks that the memory of a significant life achievement you’ve worked hard for is marred. Having said that, have you and your wife talked about your behavior around your parents being an issue for her before? Had you claimed that you would work on the issues before but haven’t made any progress? Had she set boundaries that weren’t followed? If your wife removing herself from a situation where your behavior is an issue (that you clearly agree is an issue) to avoid conflict I don’t think she is the problem but with the info provided I don’t know if you are either. I think the lack of communication in your story and her reaction saying “I hate you right now” shows you both need to work on some things."

Is there seriously no other time and no other place where you could Skype your gf? I doubt that your room or your sisters room are the only places you can skype... unless ""skyping"" is actually your way of saying you will be having video sex in which case ewwww I can see why your sister doesnt want you on her bed or trust you to just sit at her desk."
bntbef,"NAH you’re both tired and you made the drive to support her. She was of course overwhelmed and you fell asleep, you have needs too and can’t blame yourself."

bntcn2,what? she has no basis to go to HR If anything you could go to HR lol
bntfld,"You're definitely not at fault, but I couldn't figure out whether or not your mother was an asshole for her decision not to invite your dad. I've come to the conclusion that you have that she likely didn't invite your Dad out of spite, though not because his Mother died and she wants him to feel worse, but just a general spiteful attitude. (Judging by how you talk about their marriage.) So I'm going to say NTA, I believe your mother is to a certain degree, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go out with her to dinner. After all, it IS Mother's day, and because you have a good relationship with her and can't prove she didn't invite your Dad out of spite, that's probably your best course of action."
bntibx,"NTA
You cant expect it, even though imo you should have it. Just tell them how you feel in a mature way. Even when youre 18 its their house so that wont change much. Dont be afraid to confront them"

>...and our parents had her at age 40 so they get exhausted with her antics very quickly. As consequence, she usually ends up getting whatever she wants from someone or another after a tantrum or two.

Your parents decided to have 8 kids, they don't get to just skimp out on parenting just because this is kid number 8. This day is for YOU, and I'd stand your ground. Also, your mom is a complete asshole for this...

> our mother got upset with me because “now everyone has to listen to her cry about it”"
bntqv5,"ESH. He's obviously the biggest asshole, but I think you should tell her. They've been together for so long, and as much as finding out he's cheating may be devastating for her, finding out that her closest friends knew, and everyone kept it from her would be awful. She'd feel like she's lost everyone.

She deserves to know that her husband is cheating, especially since others in the friendship group know."

bntzo9,"NTA. Condoms don’t always prevent the spread of STI’s. While chlamydia isn’t a HUGE deal in the grand scheme of things, it can often be asymptomatic in men, making it harder to detect. Your gf was a major asshole for fucking someone at all knowing her treatment course wasn’t done.

Edit: and that guy could have caught it and gone on to spread it to others, too."
bnu20x,"NTA. I agree with you, it's never too early. It doesn't even have to be bought. Handmade gifts are often more valuable to parents bc it shows their thoughtfulness, don't feel bad bc your totally in the right here"
bnu2fb,Nta. They were trying to force you to pay for their mistake.

I would personally just say ‘sorry i cant hear anything really even with my hearing aids in’ they will understand."
bnugs9,NAH but I teach my kids to never pet other dogs. You never know if that dog is going to be kid friendly or not.. even of the owner says they are- people are idiots and It's not worth the risk. I've offended people more than once by telling my kids not to get their dogs after they said it was ok.
bnui9y,"NTA. Your daughter sounds like she is having fun and will figure it out, anything can happen at any time. Be it a week a month or 6 years from now she could end up in a relationship.

She's an adult, she can do as she pleases.

Edit: she could also just as happily be a spinster. There are no negative connotations with that life. I know a family freinds in their 70s, that never married and they had a rich fulfilling life where they dedicated themselves to many passions. Coincidentally, she is an artist. When I asked her if she would have done it differently, she said no, whilst they love the idea of children and love love. They sure had one hell of a ride and learned so much and seeing freinds children and being a part of other people's lives is all the love she has needed


EDIT: Thankyou everyone for the karma"
bnuj7n,"I'd say NAH, looks like you made a choice based on how your mom was acting. I'd say, get with your dad and plan a nice dinner. Than take a moment with your mom to talk and explain that you hadn't been sure she wanted your company, but you would love to celebrate her still."
bnujgq,"NAH - he's hoping to share with you stuff that means a lot to him, but, unfortunately as often happens, it's just not that important to you.  YNTA for wanting your room in your own style.

bnvgno,"NTA, M's Mom is definitly TA. First of all she accused you for not showing up with no real evidence, then she ignored your mom message, and then she told your gf that she should break-up with you, and more than that she made M's dad and sister believe you lie aswell. I think that this is an absolute bizzare behavior from an adult in her age. The situation that happened to you is really unpleasant, but it should have ended after a couple of talks, but she made a mass out of it."
bnvh1h,"NTA

Just do what you can to tolerate the visit and leave it in the rear view mirror.

That’s silly. Some take encouragement as sympathy and that can make them react differently. 

I’m sorry the person exploded publicly, but no, you’re not the asshole."
bnvkk5,"NTA- this doesn’t even sound like an issue. Explain to your mother what you just said here, and help her compromise. 

While you’re at it, wish her a happy Mother’s Day too."
bnvsam,NTA. Family stuff gets really complicated when your parents are divorced and don't play nice. You're NTA for wanting to avoid the drama altogether. Just decide if it's something you'll regret or not.
bnvu8u,NTA. They're wannabes.
bnvudj,NTA. Being touched by a stranger is weird. Doesn't matter if they're handicapped or not. You're allowed personal space.

bnvz97,"NTA. This person didn’t show any remorse for all the bullying they did and that shows that they probably haven’t changed, they might even try to manipulate your bf into turning against you (I wouldn’t be surprised if they did). You have every right to be upset but maybe this person has changed so you never know."

bnw5qe,"NAH. As a mother I fucking hate Mother’s Day. It gets so built up socially but you’re not supposed to ask for anything or say what you’d like - your kids and spouse are supposed to magically guess it. It’s so much hype and it just sucks. 

FWIW I’d have given her the card at the same time as everyone else. The breakfast thing is on them. I’d never guess “no plans” really means “important family breakfast and gift giving”. I’m sorry it wound up so sucky."
bnwaal,"YTA

You accepted, said you would make plans, and then bailed. Your friend may be pushy and you shoulda stood firm on rejecting the double date, but accepting and then bailing makes you TA here"
bnwbdj,"Disclaimer:  I am not a medical professional.  It sounds like you were babysitting a girl with a moderate to severe case of autism, and the family definitely should have told you.  With kids with more severe cases of autism, it can be very hard to get them to eat, and they're very picky about food.  It does not look like a case of abuse to me.  Likely, CPS will sort that out in short order.

""I'm now thinking I made a mistake.""  Maybe a little bit of a mistake but it sounds like you're a young person who has very little experience with special needs kids, and the family made a mistake by not informing you of their child's special needs."
bnwc2u,YTA. Your sister went through a lot of trouble to help you and has more reason to need the seat. It would have taken barely any time to get her to move on the plane.

Autistic person here. Your girlfriend completely has the wrong idea about us, and the fact that she's both trying to ""diagnose"" you and also trashtalking you behind your back is a huge red flag. You need to run."
bnwz1b,"NTA, but she may not realize the cost. I would just sit her down and talk to her. When. I turned 16, my BF at the time didn't have his DL yet so I drove everywhere. He would give me like $5 once in a blue moon... Even though I was driving him places that I wouldn't have gone normally. So I sat him down and went through how much I was paying monthly in gas and how much I was driving him around. He honestly bad no clue because he had never driven before (he got in trouble at 15 and Mom refused to take him to get his DL until he went on his own at 18). I'm sure shell be receptive."
bnwzse,"NTA

The guitar is your property you can choose who gets to use and who does not."

bnx7nq,"NTA.

>they think I should let her because I dont live there and I'm not using the room

In that case, they can pay for your portion of the rent. Tell them it's either your room and they stay out of it, or they can have it and pay for your share. They can't have it both ways."
bnx95n,"NTA, if you don't want a tattoo that should be the end of the discussion. She'd probably be (rightfully) pissed if you pressured her to get a nose job (or other permanent body modification) she didn't want. It goes both ways."
bnxagz,"NTA. I’m an atheist myself, but I also understand other people’s need for faith. His utter lack of respect for you and your beliefs is a major red flag to me. You didn’t preach to him, you aren’t trying to attack anyone’s rights, there’s no reason to be an asshole to you. 

He also needs to understand how to debate. “It’s stupid and people who believe it are stupid”, isn’t a debate."
bnxeao,[deleted]
bnxf48,NTA- this is one of those situations where you would have hated each other in a few months time.
bnxgc0,I'm gonna say ESH because you definitely should have talked to your brother before doing this. Your parents are definitely over-reacting. It also depends on whose money is being used to buy the vape stuff. If your brother is paying for it you and your parents are definitely the assholes.
bnxj5j,"YTA. Yes, small planes are more dangerous than commercial ones but they are still probably safer than if they were getting in a car (i dont have evidence for this, I'm just assuming. if there is evidence otherwise please lmk). Are you not going to let them learn how to drive solely because teen accidents aren't so uncommon? They will hopefully remember flying with grandpa for the rest of their lives, not ""Mom wouldn't let us have fun with him."""
bnxlnp,NTA - the only way to help an alcoholic is to avoid an alcoholic
bnxnjy,YNTA. People think they can treat people like shit and still demand respect from said person. Your mom sounds toxic and maybe the best thing you can do is stay a away from her and love her from a far distance
bnxnol,"NTA. You’re not his keeper, and he’s just looking for a free ride."
bnxplz,"YTA for lying to your boyfriend. It seems like you realize that. I don't think your intentions were bad but why lie about coming out? It wouldn't likely change his opinion of you, in fact it might give him the opportunity to support you through coming out eventually when you're ready. Lies will only ever hurt a relationship"
bnxpt6,NTA I think you’re being a great parent here and are helping teach him good habits that he will hopefully grow into doing himself.
bnxvtt,"NTA. If she's making you uncomfortable with her actions she should change them. Sounds like she should also see a doctor too, if she genuinely has health problems and isn't already seeing one."
bnxvuk,"NTA.   The fact that unqualified people don't believe you (which sucks) doesn't change the fact that somebody who is qualified, your therapist, does.  Pay no attention to the secretary; she's not medically qualified either.

Having an invisible disability or a mental disability is hard, because people gleefully disbelieve you.  If you can't believe yourself, believe your doctor."
bnxwzi,NTA. That’s super disrespectful (and gross) and they should be more discreet about their fun times in the shared bathroom. No reason you should be the one to clean after them.
bnxxst,"Yes unfortunately YWBTA if you did, so please don’t.  Getting a person arrested by ICE in this current political climate is not only cruel and in poor taste, but also a lot of assumptions would be made about you that you do not want, I promise you.  There’s got to be another way to solve your problems other than completely ruining a person’s life."

bnxysx,NTA. The neighbors are being obscenely selfish and they should get towed for double parking.
bny0mm,"ESH. You could have saved your friendship and a good working relationship if you would have hammered out the details beforehand, letting him know how much time and effort to into each one. You both failed at that and now you're squabbling over a very small amount of money."
bny81d,"NTA. She didn't raise you or even knew you before you were an adult, therefore she is not your mother."
bnya0r,"YTA. You accused them all of being disrepectful without evidence. You could have simply asked why they used his first name, rather than his last."
bnyb49,NTA. If it’s interfering with your sex life and esp if it ends up being painful for you then that’s a problem. IMO.

bnyemh,[deleted]
bnyg4v,"ESH (except your son) - Your parents suck for obvious reasons and you suck for keeping them around. 


Having to hide who you are because people who are supposed to love you hate people like you sucks. Your son probably feels on edge around them anytime the topic of LGBT issues comes up. Even if they never directed slurs at him until today, I'm willing to bet that they still said some nasty things about gay people around him and I guarantee you he felt every last one cut deep.


When dealing with bigots you can't play both sides. As far as your son is concerned you are either 100% with him or 100% against him. There's no middle ground and you need to lay down the law with your parents that they cannot be hateful and have a relationship with you and their grandson."
bnyih6,"NTA. They should've given you a heads up. Just letting you pay the bill by yourself without warning is fucked up. If it were me, I would just pay for my mom and myself tbh.

You should only pay by yourself when you want to, not when others want you to pay. Other than that, split it"

Your parents set your brother up for failure, and abused/neglected you in the process. Not your responsibility.

He needs help becoming independent. There are millions with schizophrenia that don't live with their parents."
bnyp13,"YTA. Mother's Day isn't the time to ""get the feel"" of \*your\* guns regardless, but especially so when it leaves her doing nothing and watching you for almost a half hour straight, and leaves her with less than half of the rounds once you were done. Her reaction seems pretty fair to me.

Her worse reaction to you not \*really\* owning up to being the asshole of the situation and shifting the blame to her for something definitely your ""responsibility"" also seems fair. (E: Even if you honestly didn't think you were, just straight apologizing is probably the right idea in this specific situation)

&#x200B;

E: That's why I'd say no assholes here... on any other day. On Mother's Day you should be actively making sure it's about her."
bnyqdt,YTA. Don’t bother wild animals for shits and giggles.
bnyqnz,"NTA - you both want different things. You made a decision based on a crush and found out he wasn’t all you imagined.  That happens 50 times a day, every day, so don’t imagine you are in a special circumstance.

As you get older, you will probably realize that you could easily be friends with him since he really did nothing horrible to you.  However, in reality you probably have little in common, so other than saying hello and being polite, there is no point to anything further."
bnysmc,"Nah man. Use whatever bathroom is free. People are too uptight. There is no actual reason for bathrooms to be segregated by gender.

Situations like this piss me off!  Guy can't be bothered to be a father, then once the kid is grown and all the hard work of the kid being raised is finished, they show up in the life of the kid they abandoned and suddenly wanna play Dad and be Grandpa and act as wholesome as Mr. Rogers.  

Totally your call and whatever you decide is ok. You owe him nothing, tho.

It’s part of his history and erasing the pictures doesn’t erase the history.

bnzo9y,"NAH Your girlfriend is going through a tough time, so I'm not going to say that she's an asshole. She sounds like she wanted space and you're giving it to her."
bnzphg,"NAH. I think this heavily depends on what you want to do with your education after high school (or very soon, by the sound of it). You’re young, and your parents want to make sure you know all of your options and don’t regret something you missed out on later. 

Your high school will likely work with the credits you’ve earned taking those upper level classes at the community college. Maybe you can graduate early. Having a traditional high school diploma wouldn’t be the worst thing, but you have other options, too. 

I would talk to your parents about where you want to take your education. Make sure they know you don’t want this to be a social decision, you care more about your education and good use of your time. You sound very bright and I’m sure you have great things ahead of you regardless of the path you take to get there."
bnzpne,"NAH.  You want different things from the relationship.  No matter how much you might like one another, you aren't compatible as friends because of this.

bnzqk5,"It sounds like you and R are friends.  You don't need to buy weed for him or do his work for him to be his friend.  Matter of fact, you should let him know that you won't do his work for him due to academic honesty policy.  But I don't think you'd be happy totally ghosting him."

bo08pb,"NTA... I think? Take my judgement with a grain of salt cause I'm unsure if I truly understand what's going on. But from what I'm understanding, you didn't intentionally do anything wrong. She seemed pretty sensitive and quickly annoyed. If stating things she already knows and editing a wiki wrongfully caused her to leave a Fandom, maybe she wasn't as into it as she truly thought she was. But then again, I'm a little confused here."
bo09fj,"YTA I'm not sure what you think ""bonding"" time consists of,  but I digress. Your dad isn't going to be around forever,  and if you really don't have any issues with him outside of ""it's boring"" you really should make some kind of effort to see him more than twice a year. It obviously bothers him since he seems to think you don't like him. 

You can't possibly be THAT busy to where you can't spare a couple hours every month or so to have lunch or dinner with your dad."
bo0a9b,"YTA. You’re so obsessed with “respect” for your parents, that you’re showing absolutely none for your girlfriend. She said thankyou to your dad, you admit that. But perhaps your parents are annoyed she didn’t fawn all over them enough? At the end of the day, you’re American, she’s American and your parents have lived in America for decades. Therefore, those are the cultural values that prevail. If you don’t like it, go date someone that’s also Filipino. 

Your girlfriend has apparently never actually been rude or offensive to your parents and has acceded your demands to acknowledge them more when you asked. She’s right that you are nitpicking and it’s never enough for you. Plus, you said you went with her to pick the TV up. So how are you in any doubt as to whether she said thankyou and goodbye to your dad or not?! Instead of listening to her, you’re letting your passive aggressive parents and sister create shit in your relationship with her. For someone that brags about how intelligent his parents are, neither you nor they seem very smart at all."

bo0l4n,"NTA 

You're not doing anyone any harm, just playing in to a fantasy like the majority of the people on there. The contact you have with the people on chat lines isn't long, you talk on the phone with them once and that's it.

bo16kh,"NTA. You would not be ""choosing"" your mom, you would be allowing her to manipulate and control you. You don't want to stay home, you want to go on the trip. So go. Clearly, your mom has emotional issues she isn't dealing with and you are not helping by constantly submitting to them. Sit your mom down and let her know, calmly and firmly, that the cats are going to a kennel, and you are going on the trip with your husband. Period.  She won't have to worry about them while you are gone. Do not allow her to manipulate you with whatever she says about how horrible it will be, just lay down what is happening in no uncertain terms."
bo17gj,"NTA, and for future, the courtesy is letting her know (which you didn't have to do either), not asking her if it's OK.  She doesn't get a say in this.

bo1o58,"NTA for wanting him to help out more. But the reality is that he's going home in a couple of days, and you won't have to deal with this anymore, so don't waste your time/energy/effort on this. Focus on your studies."
bo1xj5,NTA - your mate had chances to see the movie and prioritized other stuff.
bo1zls,"NTA. I’m going to ignore the labor thing since not only is English not your first language, but you addressed it in other comments. 

Look. I’ve got a dog. My dog is amazing. She’s the best decision I ever made, the best part of my day, and the love of my life. Her face makes me happy 100% of the time. I. Adore. This. Dog.

But. 

She’s a dog. 

My roommate has a kid that lives with us, so while I don’t have kids, I’ve kinda fallen into the role of step-mom. Ya know what I can do with my dog? Leave her alone all day. Train (or not train) her, which takes a few months of work and then just upkeep. Feed her twice a day. Dog park to socialize. Do I jokingly call myself “mama” to the dog? Yes. Mostly because other people started it, and I picked it up. Do I actually believe she’s my child? No. This isn’t parenthood, it’s responsible pet ownership. 

The kid needs help with homework, and good support systems, and reliable routines, and advice/guidance as to how to grow up as a functioning human. He needs a variety of foods, good nutrition (that isn’t scooped out of a bag twice a day), and to learn what healthy eating is. He needs to be shaped and nurtured into a good person who interacts with his world in a thoughtful and meaningful way. *That* is parenthood."
bo21fp,ESH - she shouldn’t have asked (tacky). You shouldn’t have promised.
bo2203,"YTA. Your dad is right about planning and is actually just wanting the best for you. 
Tbh, you're winging. 
I wish I had your dad that would ask me ""how do you plan on getting there?"". Main reason for that is if I explained my plan, chances are I would get experienced advice or motivation.

Stop winging at life cause you think planning doesn't matter."
bo22wx,"YTA, not for being mad about her ignoring you, but for this:

bo2c05,"In situations like these it’s tricky, you run the risk of again looking like an asshole because apologies like these are usually self-serving- more to make you feel better about it than to do anything for her. She’s most likely over it by now, you’re not getting her back, and there’s overall no real reason to apologize. She could be receptive and accept the apology but overall it’s not doing much for anyone but yourself. I’d say NTA but not really necessary to do so anyway"
bo2fzi,"YTA.  Five in the morning is a very strange time to go out riding ATVs with your boyfriend.  Could it be true? Sure, but that's weird.  It's also very unlikely two young people are out riding ATVs and neither had a cell phone.  It's also weird to ask to come into someone's house to use a phone.  You could just ask to borrow the phone outside.  

This person at the door was acting suspicious.  And the woman called police.  Who can help them with their being stranded situation.  Which is what the woman at the door wanted - help with the being stranded situation.  

This isn't the same as calling the police because a weird looking person walked down the sidewalk at three in the afternoon.  

If the woman who made the post ended up killed in her home, we'd all be asking why she was so stupid to trust this weird story and let a random person in her house at six AM."
bo2kw6,"NTA 
I'm not sure what age these kids are, but clearly they're quite young. 

There's no reason for this teacher to be going off on the kid like that. Sometimes parents are just busy and don't have anything in the house that's healthy. A lot of healthy snacks are perishable, it could just be that the parent thought a packet of crisps would be fine for one day. 

Either way, the teacher shouldn't tell the student off for it, the parent is the one who packed the lunch. She should have calmly told the kid to bring a healthy snack next time and contact the parents, if she really needed to. 

Can you file a complaint against her, even if it's anonymous? If she's upsetting the kids unnecessarily and causing disruptions to other kids learning because of her shouting, then she needs to be told to take it down a notch or two. 
Maybe if you can, bring it up with some of the other parents? They might not be aware of her behaviour and how it's effecting the kids. If enough parents complain then maybe something can be done about how this teacher is handling things.
School is stressful enough without being scared of your teacher."
bo2psk,NTA.  Your nephew was being extremely inconsiderate by inviting his friends to your home. You do not have to provide shelter to people you do not know.
bo2sno,"NTA but I would highly suggest using more tact than ""you're aggravating"" if you approach him with this. I come from a family riddled with addiction and am in recovery myself. Coming from a place of concern is going to get you farther than putting him on the defensive."
bo2tu6,"NTA. My neighbor frequently cooks dinner that smells awfully of fish. It lingers for hours. My family could only smell it when we stepped into the hallway which was bare able. You pay rent, you have the right to live there and cook whatever you want. I wouldn’t worry about it."
bo2v39,Yes YWBTA for sleeping at work and in a place not for you but designed for nursing. Regardless of your desire it would be wrong

bo3pu5,"NTA, your mother will be thinking her attitude is cute. It's not."
bo3tp5,"NTA: report that person that is not a normal response especially when told to stop. 

this is stalking"
bo3try,"NTA there's a reason why DCF exists, exactly for situations like this. Understandably hard because of the housing situation, like I get people are going to do what they want but getting children involved makes it a bit worse. Now just because you call DCF doesn't necessarily mean they'll immediately take action, but I think what you described constitutes evidence of something not being right. If they think they need to take action they will, but at least they'll be aware if you call."
bo3x8u,[deleted]
bo3y9q,"NTA at all. NTA especially if you're planning on actually having kids and passing them down. Now if you made that line up just to have an excuse to keep them, then you're a small asshole (they're your toys but not serving any particular purpose). But in any case you aren't obligated to donate your possessions that have meaning to you, regardless of whether it might be a good thing to do."
bo4ead,"ESH.

There is a current trend in parenting that is super focused on a child's boundaries being respected.  You're clearly very on board with this trend and FK's mom probably isn't.

I think kid's boundaries should be respected, but there is also a lot to be said for being resilient enough to go with the flow at times.  You start out talking about unwanted hugs (a real hot button issue with the parents who are focused on a child's boundaries being respected) but you also throw in FK ""yelling right by them"" (which is not generally part of the boundary setting mantra).

>K1 is getting out of the pool, already upset that we have to leave. FK, who is a bit ahead, says “let’s race!” and splashes K1 in the process of swimming away. K1 is pissed, and screams, “NO K1, I DONT WANT TO RACE, STOP SPLASHING ME!”

What you're saying here is that FK *inadvertently* splashed K1.  If K1 is nearly 7, she should understand the difference between intentionally bad behavior and unintentionally bad behavior.  Even a 5 year old should be beginning to understand this.  This is very different than an unwanted hug as FK is having his own party here.  Particularly since K1 was already wet, I don't think this should have been a huge issue.  

>My friend tells K1, “Just because you’re mad doesn’t mean you can be a jerk to FK.”

You are a jerk is different than you are being a jerk.  I'd guess neither statement works with your view of parenting, but there is a difference.

>Later, K1 tearfully told me that she wasn’t trying to be a jerk to FK, that she was just frustrated. I told K1 within ear shot of my friend that she isn't a jerk, and my friend shouldn’t have called her one.

I have sympathy for you daughter here and I'm not entirely sure how to best approach this, but your reaction doesn't acknowledge the difference between ""you are a jerk"" and ""you are being a jerk."" FK's mom wasn't damning your daughter to hell, she was saying that K1 is overreacting and being mean to FK.  Whether or not you agree with that, it is different from the way you treated it.

FK's mom might be a little lax for your taste (and maybe isn't a great friend match for you), but you seem so hyper focused on your kid's experience that it seems like you might unintentionally be  discouraging your children from developing go with the flow resilience.  I'd bet that if FK's mom posted this she's talk about how your kids always need to have everything their own way and can't handle basic kid negotiations without screaming for mommy and that you always make everything about your kids.

> My kids’ yelling is often used as vindication of FKs actions, as if FK not respecting my kids boundaries is ok because my kids didn’t set them nicely enough.

You talk about FK yelling as a violation of your kid's boundaries, but you then excuse your own kid yelling.  You seem to be missing the middle ground here.  Your kids should understand the difference between accidental splashing and intentional splashing.  They also need to learn how to negotiate social situations without being all ""Mommy, this child asked me to play a game I don't want to play twice!""

I'm not sure if you should continue this friendship as you clearly have very different values, but I think you really need to consider how your actions are effecting your children's social skills."
bo4l5n,NAH - Your wife is right to tell you to go on your own. You don't have to feel guilty for keeping this tradition on your own. Part of having a healthy marriage is realizing that you should each carve out your own space to do things on your own.
bo4m63,"NTA, but it sounds like your wife might be depressed from someone who has lived through a similar situation, so that might be something to speak to a psychiatrist about."
bo4ptd,NTA. You wouldn’t have been fulfilling your roles on those committees if you didn’t report the student.
bo4ris,[deleted]
bo4tc3,"NTA. Just understand that you are probably going to escalate tensions. Also, it’s a baby. The party may be for the nephew, but they have no clue what’s going on.  Middle ground would be scheduling something (theater tickets or the like) and lying your butt off that you had them before you knew the party date and send a small gift."
bo4u9i,"NTA.  You stopped applying, an interview kinda fell in your lap, there's no good reason to not at least give it a shot.  Your boyfriend is being a little stubborn for not even being willing to discuss it.  Why is it so important to him that you wait one more year before you move?"
bo4vux,[deleted]
bo4zrp,NAH You could take a picture of you and the bear together then you have the sentimental value without taking up all the space.
bo53gh,"YTA. A LOT of stores will enter in the “store number” for people without loyalty accounts for myriad reasons. It may very well be store policy, and they may have even been doing you a solid by enabling discounts for you. Calm down."
bo557d,"YTA. She asked for help with a few more items, and instead of helping like a normal person you started a fight."
bo56pt,"YTA - There are better, more mature, ways to handle this."
bo578q,NTA. Let her be upset and hurt. You're still visiting. And that's what matters.
bo5c2e,[removed]
bo5i53,"NTA, just because threatening to kick someone out of the car is a harsh reaction to what you said. Sure, complaining about his car is looking a gift horse in the mouth, and there is a more polite way to ask someone to turn down music. You weren’t very nice, but hey a lot of neurotypical brothers talk to each other like this too so it’s kind of up to the brothers IMO. If it’s really upsetting him then response should have been more like “see if I give you more rides after this in my junk car/I’d rather not do more favors for you in the future if you’re not going to appreciate them.” Threatening to kick someone out of a ride in progress is a bridge further than that."
bo5ib2,"NTA

You are absolutely right that a cat suddenly urinating places it shouldn't is usually a sign of a health issue.

Your friend may be trying to deny that reality or have some other holdups about bringing the cat to the vet."
bo5ix4,"NTA- if you've made your feelings pretty clear and she's not taking the hint, then that isn't your fault. You don't have to be friends with people because you feel bad for them. Be firm and let her know as kindly and politely as possible that you aren't interested in being friends with her. If she still doesn't back off, then I'd recommend just blocking her considering she lives pretty far from you and there's no real reason to keep that line of communication open."
bo5p7d,"NAH

He cut of his own arm why should you try to comfort him for his own mistake.

He should've thought from the beginng how it's going to end."
bo5u04,"NTA 

It was a nice gesture so she could celebrate Mother’s Day. You didn’t have to do anything, but you did and that was kind of you.

Your brother, on the other hand, is being childish. Even if you were having a thing, she’s not in a relationship with him anymore. He made sure of that."
bo5u0z,[deleted]
bo5wag,"NTA, because your mom sounds paranoid.

However, this:

>While presenting you would think I was talking to an alien race who had never bought a cheese stick before. One girl asked why there was so much calf housing, and I was like seriously? You know why. And she keeps asking, so I explained that the cows have to give birth every year to make the milk, and obv 🙄 we can’t keep the calves because not killing them costs money, first in the milk they would drink and then the incredible amount of grain a grown a-s cow would need, and we would double the herd size every year until the world was full of cows—it’s simple math.

> I think some people just pretend not to know it so they can drink milk in peace. But she and some other girls acted soooo horrified 😱 and sooo surprised 😱 , and my presentation got derailed, and I ran out of time. I didn’t even show the last three pictures. It's the insincerity that bothers me--I don't like ppl being FAKE.

Many people just don't know the ins and outs of farms, and are ignorant of the things that are necessary for farmers to do.  It's not insincere, it's just that they don't know.

As long as your cows are being treated humanely, your mom doesn't have to worry about those durned libruls storming your farm."
bo623q,"Just state that it's a mother & daughter only trip, since it is. NTA - Hope you and your mom get to enjoy it."
bo627h,YTA - not exactly sure why she would owe you an apology of all things? Maybe an offhand thanks for the uber but why would she have to apologize to you?
bo6342,"NTA she sounds like a MIL from hell, taking care of a baby is stressful enough without somebody breathing down your neck the whole time"
bo67ol,"NTA. I prefer to directly choose and research my charities *thoroughly* before agreeing to donate any money, even if it's $0.46. I want that money actually going to the cause, not into the deep pockets of some CEO.

Edit: but if you're feeling eaten up about it, pick your fave charity and toss 'em $5 or $10."
bo69rg,"NTA Two year olds suck and she won't remember this when she is older, anyway."
bo6h1f,"NTA

You didn't buy it from a breeder, you adopted it from some idiots. Big difference. Now just don't declaw it and I won't hate you."
bo6hkh,"uh what, that jumped from zero to 100 real quick

Edit: YTA btw"
bo6lyw,"NTA. After all the bullshit they put you through when you were trying to give them a safe and comfortable place to stay I don’t blame you for saying no. I wouldn’t have wanted to help them, either."
bo6v9e,"NTA.  I did terrible like him on the first mother's day for my ex-wife (wife at the time).  If you want it to change, you are just going to have to talk to him about it.  FWIW, I did way better this Mother's Day and we aren't even married anymore."
bo6yrz,"ESH, but also LOL your neighbor is a total dickwad. You definitely made an asshole move, but I must say it was not unwarranted. I think you'd have been better off gathering evidence and phoning the cops."
bo6yzn,"NTA... As independent adults, you aren't obliged to live where she tells/wants you to... it's really that simple. I'm guessing she's just a little disappointed that she won't be able to split the bills with someone in her new house."
bo71hz,YTA. This is a ridiculous thing to get that upset about.
bo73rx,"YTA

Boy i'm gonna take some downvotes for this one I feel, but at the end of the day he's free to want the person he wants for whatever reason he wants. I assume Jenny has the ability to say no to customers that she doesn't want to work with (if she doesn't, that's a problem on your businesses' end.)

Also, your company policy of not allowing him to reschedule when you've had to make changes on your end is complete bullshit."
bo77ex,"NTA but a few notes: 

I don't mean to be that person but there are more embarrassing times to be told this than here - weary means tired, wary means being aware or being nervous of problems

I'd also be wary of deciding you can help people with severe depression and anxiety because you've dealt with sort of similar things - mental health and how it effects individuals is deeply personal and different for everyone, and diving into a friendship with ""I'm gonna HELP"" as a catalyst rarely ends well for anyone involved 

S is absolutely the asshole here but a depressed guy being helped by a girl and thinking that means there must be romance is a tale as old as time (like, beauty and the beast doesn't help lol) 

However, you did handle it well, dropping hints you wanted to go alone etc. Was a good move"
bo78du," NTA, your Big is infatuated with Ben and simply frustrated that her feelings weren’t reciprocated. Things might be different if they were dating, but seeing as you just slept in the same bed, she’s wrong to make assumptions and blow the situation out of proportion."
bo78ow,"YTA.

If you want a dress up evening, discuss it in advance. Don't call her out for not reading your mind."
bo79ck,"NAH. You thought you were closer to them than perhaps you actually are, and got understandably hurt by that. You communicated it to one of the guys (in what I assume was a non-asshole way) and his response didn't seem asshole-ish. Maybe you could either continue the honest conversation with that one guy you messaged, or find some local friends to hangout with?"
bo7fp6,"NTA

Why not play a less noisy game...? Who tf wants to listen to bells ring all night?"

It's not a huge deal but she definitely didn't count on it still being there, and it looks pretty dumb and she agrees."
bo8ddf,"You’re NTA for setting boundaries but you are TA for the way you talk about your sister and her kids. What does her weight matter? How could giving her kids one ride (where you make sure they’re not eating or drinking anything) lead to you needing to spend “hours” cleaning your car afterward? I’m also guessing she snapped because she spent a lot of money to visit and you can’t feign interest in her children for a few days. If you can’t see why that would upset her, then you’re really TA."

bo8gxr,"Leaning towards YTA 

YTA because instead of working to fix your sexual issues, you just go ""EH. It's ok. I'll just use porn"". 

Sexual issues kill otherwise great relationships. You are seeing a glimpse of that now.

bo8xil,"NTA, wtf, he seems extremely demanding and entitled."
bo92sr,"A soft ESH, I can totally understand why you’re hurt, but the way you’re framing it is manipulative. 

She is backing out of an agreement which now leaves you in the lurch. It’s okay to feel screwed over, and you can absolutely explain to her that she’s put you in a very bad position which means you are risking your job because you helped her. 

There’s a fine line though between explaining how her actions impact you, and trying to manipulate her into staying by telling her you’re upset and not okay with it. One suggests she should be helping you come up with reasonable ways to solve the mutual problem, the other means there is only one right answer and that she’d better do what you say if she wants you to be “okay”. She has to make decisions that take into account her situation too. 

Either way, being okay with it or not isn’t going to solve the problem. Coming up with a plan is. You’ll need to figure out what your plan is if she doesn’t come back. Do you ask her to sublet her bed so you can share expenses? Do you move out and try to find another sublet for the summer? Do some research and let her know what the outcome of her actions may have to be. She has to decide if she’s okay with possibly losing her apartment and friend. You’ll then have to decide whether she’s someone you want to invest more friendship in. 

Good luck. Sounds like a mess and she really has put you in a bad place."
bo9332,"NTA

At 26 he should know how to not answer a question that he does not want to answer.  He could have made a joke out of it with a non-answer along the lines of  ""Not nearly enough mom"", laughed and then changed the subject.  Or even said ""A gentleman never tells Mom.  You know that."" or ""That's proprietary info!"" and kept on eating.  There are ways to shut mom down without being an asshole, but they involve social skills, skills which your brother is apparently lacking.

Not wanting to share that information with her (or anyone else for that matter) doesn't give him the right to explode, start cursing and screaming and ruin her Mother's Day or anyone else's in that restaurant."
bo939j,NTA but you can’t be annoyed if people you want to go cant afford to go.
bo95qr,"NAH.  You had a problem, were civil, and they seem to have responded appropriately.  Ramadan or not, noise considerations need to be made during the wee hours."
bo95xz,NTA. It's probably for the best honestly. This kind of secret is something that will eventually not only hurt him but also you. And it sounds like they expected it already. You just managed to find the evidence of it.
bo96qq,NTA.  They committed multiple criminal assaults upon you and your sister.  Fuck them.
bo9amz,"YTA. I am gonna get flack for this but please bear with me. You are an adult. They are under no obligation to pay for anything for you. Your food, your housing, your school, nothing. Its nice that they do though, and they seem to care for you. Your parents are concerned for you and want you to be healthy and happy. Dealing with something like this (potential food addiction) is very hard. It isn't like other addictions where you can simply avoid the temptation, no matter what you always have to eat, so you have to learn to manage this thing that is harming you.

&#x200B;

Your response sounds like some serious rationalization. If you truly believe it was a ""one off"" event, then why worry about the demand? If you are keeping to the instructions provided by the nutritionist, this goal should be attainable, even with a few cheat days? What is more, sometimes added distractions can make it more difficult to deal with these situations. Perhaps they see this as a matter of school being a part of the problem since you are unable to attend to it and your health at the same time. 

&#x200B;

Again, you are an adult. You are correct in thinking that they shouldn't be able to control you. As a matter of fact, they can't. As you said, you can do what you want and deal with the consequences. In this case, that includes neglecting the advice of physicians and losing funding for school, or finding alternate ways to make tuition."

bo9erl,"NTA - as a therapist, I can say her behaviour is outrageous. It is frightening to hear she works with trauma. You did others a favor by reporting her."
bo9g55,NTA. In my opinion I think the boutique should either reimburse the difference in dress prices so you can make the alterations or not charge you for the alterations since it was already twice as much as you were supposed to pay.
bo9jts,NTA in theory but good luck telling your girlfriend she needs help with basic hygiene.
bo9kse,"NTA The issue of asshole has nothing to do with right or wrong.

She would be an asshole for putting in something in a group project over objections of group.

You were not an asshole for offering a suggestion as to how the group project should be done collectively.

But right or wrong isn't the point."

bo9rib,"NTA

I think its acceptable (albeit a littly bitchy) for someone to request that you to not allow your dog to poop/pee in their yard, but this request should be made as nicely as possible, because dogs are just gonna do that sometimes.

Not only was she rude in making the initial request, but no body deserves to be shouted at and beckoned at like a child. I think its perfectly fine for you to just be like ""Um no, I don't respond to that"". You deserve a standard of civility in any interaction."
bo9w0b,"NTA, she had no right to video you without your consent and post it on the internet."
boa0j1,"NAH. You and your boyfriend have something that is fun a fulfilling to attend. Your aunt wanted people to do fun and fulfilling things, not dwell on her illness, nor her imminent death. I can't imagine a person like that wanting you to skip something for her funeral. Yes funerals are for the living, but they are also in honor of the dead. It seems to me that going on the trip is the best way to honor her wishes for her family. You all live in the same city. If you want to memorialize her with your cousins and other family do more fun things together."
boa0tj,"NTA- isn’t it a basic rule for the fetish community that you only participate with people who’ve consented? She needs to keep that baby stuff for the bedroom, and not when she makes a major mistake. For your own sanity, move out ASAP
Oh, and she needs to pay for new supplies and give you a genuine apology"
boa2e8,"ESH. She had no right to invent evidence and accuse you of something you haven't done. All the same, you can express that in much better ways. If you're slamming tables and pulling your own hair, it really does sounds like you might have an anger problem."
boa74n,NAH. It's good to do some things seperately. You're being very generous by helping him with a workout plan.
boa9yt,NTA. ghost him extra hard. hes an invasive creep
boaa19,"NTA this is clever and effective. Also doesn’t sound like you’re scaring her in a scarring way, it feels like when my parents “called Santa” when I was misbehaving."
boackr,"The problem is your ex, not your wife. If you both put your foot down and tell your ex that you aren't humoring her insecurities, she might eventually let off. Your wife helps you take care of your son; your son has 3 guardians, but your ex is behaving as if 2 is the maximum number a kid can have."

""You are who you surround yourself with"""
boainz,Yes - I have urged Tara to phone beth for coffee but to no avail. Beth has been ready to talk but its something they both need to agree to do. We knew it would suck 3 sisters going without the 4th thats why my mom and aunt always switched things up so they did things equally with both. But their done playing peace keepers :(
boajn7,[deleted]
boaknc,"NTA. Sounds like the whole setup of this business is a clusterfuck tbh, but you were being very respectful during your text exchange with her. She was the one being rude, but hey at least you got a heads up about them quitting!"

boap84,NTA. She is not an object that your friend can call dibs on.
boapv7,"NTA

It sounds like you two made an agreement and you were upholding it. I would probably follow up with him later, when he calms down, and see if he wants you to continue to uphold this agreement. That is if you want to continue to do so. You might even throw in some boundaries, that you won't tolerate his acting out like that when you're doing as he asked."
boaroe,NTA. Your sister is gaslighting you. Being angry when someone treats you poorly is a normal human reaction. Please find someone you can talk to so that they can assure you that your mother and sisters behavior isn’t normal and can help you cope until you can move out.
boasxd,"NTA. Your wedding, your decision. If your mother takes issue, she can stay at home that day."

boazys,"NTA- they're totally throwing you under the bus in a major grade. Sadly not unusual with group projects. Even if your script made no sense, they should have let you rewrite it. Now not only are you risking getting a bad grade, but if they just copy/pasted from other websites you could all get in trouble for plagiarism. Definitely bring it up with them again and if they won't budge, go talk to your teacher and explain the situation and hopefully you can work out a way to salvage your gradr"
bob03i,"NTA. Inviting someone to anything without asking is rude. Bring it up with your friend in a calm manner and let him know that the two of you are NOT ok with him joining you guys. Remember to give valid reasons like the one you stated about him living a ""different lifestyle"" than you guys."
bob1m1,"NAH

You're brother has a mental condition, and that's okay. But if my neighbor blared music for 2 hours every day, I'd be pretty pissed off too. I don't think your brother is doing it for the point of being obnoxious, and your neighbor probably has no ill will against him. He's just trying to live his life."
bob3pg,"YTA. He’s the one supporting the burden of the house’s financial stability.  Sure you have stress, but not as compared to his.  Your question was horrifically timed and not respectful of the situation.  Take some ibuprofen and have a hot shower then go offer your husband a massage."
bob5h4,"NTA however is this the hill you choose to die on? 

Alternatively, ask which families he would refuse to come if they were invited and if they are, apologise, say they’re invited and leave it at that."
bob5rd,"NAH if you give him a significant amount of time to find a new roommate, and assist with doing so.  Just be courteous with how you handle it.

That being said, you are going wayyyyyyy too fast with this girl.  There's no reason at all to rush this.  You have your whole life ahead of you.  Slow the fuck down, actually get to know each other far more deeply, and develop a healthy balance between relationship and the rest of your life.  This type of relationship is likely to be volatile down the line if you have no ability to pace yourself and force everything to move so fast."
bob5vd,"NTA.  How lucky your son is to have two considerate women on his team.

Replaced “daughter” with son.  Sorry!"
bobafs,"YTA. Have you ever considered the possibility that he was taking a personal day? The fact that you pay taxes doesn’t give you the right to micromanage his life and publicly shame him on social media. If you had to say something, you could have forwarded the info to the school district."
bobb3l,"NTA.

Moving so close to finishing school is hard. I can’t blame you for wanting to stay, and if you’re turning 18 it’s your choice.

I’d talk to your mum about staying though. Tell her what your step father said about revoking your visa though (if you haven’t already). That’s completely out of line."
bobdrp,NTA: I don't think it's unreasonable to ask every resident to pay equal shares
bobdu5,"NTA, but can you change the rating? That is far from a 5 star rating. Potential buyers need to know"
bobf3n,NAH... your mom is pushing retirement age working way too many hours so she's definitely stressed and taking it out on you. But you're also 22 and able bodied living rent free. You have a cushy living situation all things considered so take the good with the bad. Just keep your head down and do the best you can until you can move out. Sorry for your loss.
bobg58,"Um, you asked your ex wife, who you used to celebrate mother’s day with presumably, if she would meet your new girlfriend, ON mother’s day? Come on YTA"

bobne2,"NAH just tell Eric you would love a snake, but not until you are able to move out on your own.  Also your dad seems like a cool dad."

bobxli,YTA. Even my five year old knew to give me a gift on Mother’s Day. I wouldn’t want to talk to you either.
boc20o,"NAH. You need to talk to your parents. Since you are only 16 you don't get to give anyone a ""serious talk."" You express your feelings to your parents and they can act from there. The situation sounds incredibly sucky and I have a lot of empathy for you. We had a minor cousin move in when I was in high school and my brother was displaced to the living room for several months during some serious home construction to provide enough room. I get it, it sucks. But you aren't the one who gets to make those decisions in your house, so talk to the people who do."
boc443,"I mean, she is a homewrecker tho. Some (most) people can't handle a poly-relationship"
boc5dp,NAH but if you lay down rules like that it's almost going to guarantee that they get broken. Self fulfilling prophecy kind of deal.
boc5jz,NTA. He needs to learn common goddamn courtesy. Don't visit someone's house empty handed if you're coming over that often.
boc5n8,"YTA.

Some women might have been assholes to you because of your brother's career choice, but that's not on him.  I honestly don't think this is as big a deal to vast numbers of women as you think it will be.  Your brother is living his life, and has entrusted this secret to you, and has done nothing to you. Your feelings directed at him are entirely misplaced. 

And honestly, you don't want to date anyone who has a problem with *your brother*, not you, being a porn actor.  That's illogical and a woman who can't get over *your brother's* career choice is going to have a lot more problems with you that would require you drastically altering your life just to make them happy."
bocaur,"YTA. She's an adult and you're trying to control her life. She says there's something wrong with her, there's something wrong with her. BPD or not, if she wants to go to the doctor you take her to the fucking doctor."
bocdil,"YTA - Most definitely. 
As a father who has had to watch his wife go through a miscarriage, I would advise you to not ever take motherhood away from your friend. 
It was already taken from her."
bocg34,"Edit: the below advice is entirely predicated on K/L being willing to come forward. If they are, then everything I said still applies. If they are not, then you would be the asshole for outing them against their will. 

NTA. Holy shit, what are these justifications that people are giving you in AD 2019???


>1. He's a good football player

Entirely irrelevant. But if it were, then he shouldn't have groped your friend.

>2. He lacks proper social skills

No no no, me awkwardly asking a girl out to homecoming as a 14 year old is lacking social skills. Groping your friend is a crime.

>3. You might ruin his entire life

Probably not! But even if it were the case, letting this slide is letting this creep ruin other people's lives through his antics.

>4. He has depression

So did I, and I never groped people. Its neither an excuse nor an explanation

>5. He has anger issues

So did I, and I never groped people. Everyone has their own issues, its no excuse to hurt people


>and 6) You're probably reading too much into it.

I promise you that you are not. Jfc these adults are trash"
bochva,NAH. You have every right to feel upset that your family can't make it. It sucks that they can't come but sometimes conflicts occur. All of their excuses seem linked to their own kids so it makes sense that they'd prioritize those conflicts.
bocjwy,"NTA. yikes, this guy doesn’t seem to understand that a dog not being able to sleep on the bed or couch isn’t abuse of an animal, it’s just wanting your spaces to be respected!"
bock7w,"NTA, that's super weird and honestly indicative of mental health issues. It's not really classy of you to have said that in front of other people, but shit, I bet everyone was thinking it. That person either needs mental health care or just get her shit straight. How old y'all? I assume old enough to clean yourselves?"
bocy5r,"NTA

You're not obliged to stay anywhere. They'll figure things out, like you said, it won't be the first time."
bocy8l,[deleted]
bod30a,"YTA because your gift stemmed from the idea of improving something for your own (or your kids’ ) benefit, not because she would enjoy it. Not because of the “sexism” as you both would be doing it together. I do understand where it stemmed from, but would probably have been better received if it was a random gift rather then for your anniversary"
bod338,"YTA because you do seem rich and spoiled. Your friend is envious of your opportunity, and all you can do is complain."
bod33w,"NAH. 

As you said, she’s making effort since she’s filling out applications. I don’t know where y’all live but it may be hard to find a new living space. Maybe you could help out with the process as well?

And it’s good that you guys also offered to help with her pets. I’m sure that it would be a huge burden lifted off her shoulders. You do have to be firm now though so she may need all the help she can get."
bod7be,"NTA

This is fairly easy. Put in your two weeks notice and be on your way. I guarantee if your bosses we're in the same position, to work in a better environment and make more money, they'd take it."
bod8f7,"I do not understand this. If it is a work uniform, you should not have to pay for it. If you paid for the tux, you should be considered the owner of it, and not have to give it back. Aren’t tuxes like specially fitted for each person, waist, chest, inseam and all that? You are not the asshole. NTA"
bodca8,"YTA

You haven't even been together four months.

They've known each other since they were small children.

You are insane."
bodfjd,NTA - this situation is absolutely ridiculous and borderline abusive. You do NOT deserve to be treated this way! I think you are right to stay away from these visits for now. Your fiancee and their mom need to get to the bottom of this situation and deal with it ASAP.
bodhri,"Who could possibly be an asshole in this scenario?

NAH."
bodiaj,"NAH

You're not an a-hole for living your life. The way you phrased it seems like your mother has a fundamental issue with you switching to another religion, which isn't wrong on her part. From having religious parents, I know the tension in the room rises when you start talking about your own views on religion. Same old saying of everyone's entitled to their opinions. You said it yourself; there's no reason to apologize for proclaiming your faith."
bodlkm,"NTA.  It takes two minutes to fry an egg, and they don't hold well.  I wouldn't start cooking the eggs 'til the potential egg-eaters were in the house and looking for food."
bodm21,"NAH, it seems. While it's not wrong of you to feel upset about it, in the end your mother is legally entitled to that money before you are, and he does owe it to her."
bodmqy,"NTA, you have a duty to keep the dorms clean, and so does your neighbor. If they are not supposed to have a cat, and then can’t even take care of the cat, a little passive aggressiveness isn’t out of hand. You said the ra’s have talked with this person, so it’s a repetitive issue. I don’t think it’s your job, necessarily, but you’re not the A-hole."
bodpew,[deleted]
boduq5,"NTA, it's a severe dick move not to discuss something like that beforehand with you. Suddenly having another person in your personal space indefinitely is a big fucking deal and can't just be sprung on you like that, and you obviously have veto power over something like that if you want to enact it."
boduwd,ESH: Reporting your ex-friend for revenge on the chance she notified the police is straight vindictive. She's out of your life now. Move on.
bodvfi,"Ehh if they went on a camping trip with the husband this sounds more like a hotwife/poly type deal than an affair per se, if that makes any difference"
body57,NTA. He didn't even know the context of why she might be busy.  He's definitely the asshole
bodz7o,"NTA, your dad is. And no, that is not normal at all."
boe0os,NTA - to catfish their gay friend and then call him a dumbass for being fooled by them trying to fool him?  Fuck her.  She’s got a lot more apologizing to do.  That was cruel.
boe33a,NTA. Man that sucks. I think all you can do is act indifferent. Emotional abusers thrive on reaction because it gives them a feeling of control over the person. I hope you at least able to lock it while you’re using it.
boe7jc,NTA. Her fault for choosing someone she’s not even close with then being surprised that “gasp!” you look different.
boedwv,"NTA.

boefqo,"Yep, YTA. And like, really committed to it as well."
boeh8n,"YTA. You’re supposed to discuss these things with your wife, not make authoritarian stances because you make all the money. It’s a relationship. Two people.

boehgx,"NTA

It was one thing when it was their problem. It's now affecting you and your family. If she wants to enable his behavior, she's welcome to do so. But no, you wouldn't be an asshole at all for not doing the same."
boelgb,"NTA because you need to do what’s best for yourself and it sounds like this is an awesome opportunity for you! You should try to get her some help before leaving if possible, because the things she is saying are definitely scary. Just make sure she knows you’re always there for her and call to check in on her often!"
boemha,NTA. Not one bit. If they trust you to train someone then they should trust you with better pay.
boemui,If I saw someone fussing about the bumper of their car when some dude was gurgling his guts out onto the pavement I'd probably have much sharper things to say to them. NTA.

bof9ds,NTA and you can break off a friendship for any reason. She sounds like bad news.

bog0e9,"If you prioritise money over love then you’re gonna be really unhappy in the long run. I can understand why your boyfriend got angry. If you want more money then work for it. You sound like a spoiled brat who just wants to marry a rich person.

bogp47,NTA. He knows that it’s a part of your brand so he should know better not to ask for the solution.
bogt0m,NTA I would do the same thing. I don't see why you should keep something around that you got from someone who you've cut contact with and who's blocked you on social media. Especially if you don't use it.
bogwlc,"NAH. It’s normal for you to feel sad after being rejected, especially when you see him often because you’re friends.
But it’s also normal for your friend to try to keep the friendship. It honestly shows how much he values you as a friend.

Some time apart can probably make your feelings for him become less strong, if your friend gives you the time you need, I think no one is an asshole in your situation."
bogz30,"NTA

Find another job as quickly as you can.  You can't trust these people enough to work for them long term.

boh0wm,YTA. How often does it really happen? A kid's LIFE is in danger and could be helped by someone forced to be alerted.
boh6jg,"ESH - Yes, it is “normal” to gossip about such things but that doesn’t make it right. And when you put it in writing, it’s really easy to show or screenshot for people. His comments do seem far worse though."
boh982,So he’s her cat but everyone gets to pay for him.
bohjh1,YTA. You’re essentially asking him to foot the bill for a more expensive place because he makes more than you. That’s ridiculous and a fiscally irresponsible way of thinking. You’re way out of line with that thinking and make yourself look bad.
bohka4,"WTF!???


>Most of our other friends also sided with him, saying that he needs a man every now and then.

Then he divorces you and lives the single life!!! This is like saying it's totally ok for heterosexual married men to have multiple female lovers because they ""have urges""!

>that he just wanted to satisfy his needs

FFS."
bohofi,"well, put yourself in his shoes. Would you have preferred someone hiding the truth from you?"
bohoqy,"NTA- As a mother, I would never ask my kids for a $200 gift of any kind. Monetary or otherwise. She really has over stepped a bit here. I understand why you feel like an ATM, she is treating you like one. In reading this, I can tell there is a lot more to your story. I am sorry you grew up like that. Your gift last year of a nice dinner for her and your sister was more than a generous gift. Sounds like she's taking advantage of you. Read The giving tree by Shel Silverstein. You don't want to be a stump my friend. Good luck. Ty for helping to keep me and my family safe. We appreciate your service."
bohr7c,"This is going to get downvoted but I'm going to go with ESH here. 

He's an asshole for saying that you were in a relationship, flipping out, and blocking you instead of understanding, of course, However, my reasoning is for ESH instead of 'Not The Asshole' this line:

> I ended up developing feelings for him, but still didn’t feel ready to actually be with anyone. I told him this  and he said he would wait until I felt ready. I felt uncomfortable with that and told him not to wait because I didn’t want to feel pressure to hurry up and get over my heartbreak, but he said waiting was his only option as he couldn’t see himself with anyone else. I didn’t push it and our friendship continued as normal. 

You told him that you had feelings for him and that you just weren't 'ready.' That's giving him false hope, especially if you were never planning on dating him in the first place, which is leading him on. You saying that you 'didn't push it' left the question open-ended, instead of giving him closure and finality. I had an experience very similar to this, and I can tell you that when he fell, he fell hard. Not giving him the closure of saying 'no, I won't date you, and I probably never will,' is part of the reason of his behavior."
bohypy,"NAH. It's perfectly fine to stop this tradition, but I don't blame the rest of family for enjoying it. Is this a parents and siblings only dinner, no spouses or kids allowed? 

I would start by talking to siblings about being done giving birthday gifts, then approach your parents. Either way, you're an adult and you can stop going if you don't want to."
bohzeb,NTA -  Yeah the driver trying to make you get off and that get back on like your some child she is teaching a lesson is ridiculous.      Also what difference does it make who gets on the bus first ?

boi360,"here's the thing you need to accept: her boyfriend demands she gets rid of you but she CHOSE that boyfriend. she decided this was the person she wanted to be in a relationship with despite the conditions he gave her.

you're NTA, but you need to give some consideration to the fact that your friend is  fine with ditching you to be in a relationship. A lot of people make the mistake of ditching friends for a relationship.  Honestly, I'd say your friend - female, male or WHATEVER - has made a choice.  You aren't superman and it's not your job to save her. if you want to say you don't think her relationship is healthy, as a friend you absolutely can say that... but she can make her own choices, no matter how bad, and you have to realize that. Say your thoughts once if you choose to do so, and move on."
boi5y0,"NAH. You feel like your friend is a good support, and as you said, you didn't want to worry your dad.

I had to come back to switch my judgement based on this comment from OP:

>We did ask her to stop seeing the boy that caused this final rift between her and Luke. She refused at first but I do track her phone so I was able to call her out on it. It has since ended and she does use this as leverage. 

That comment makes it crystal clear OP values Luke's hurt feelings over Kate's desire to move on. These are adults. Trying to keep control of her romantic relationships at this point is... problematic.

~~Kate has made it clear to Luke she does not want to have a romantic relationship with him and he has asked her for space to clear his head and move on, and none of that has anything to do with your relationship with either of them. You care for them both and want them both to be happy. You love and support your daughter, so obviously continue to do what you normally do for your daughter to make her feel loved and supported, but you are not bound to cut Luke out on her say-so. Luke and Kate are adults now and it's time for your daughter to start acting like one.~~"

bok79i,"I’m Scandinavian, so... prepare for some super european opinions, i guess.

this woman did NOTHING wrong. she’s allowed to be naked in her own home. blinds and curtains serve our desire for privacy in our homes, they’re not an obligation to be unseen. she’s fully allowed to be naked with the blinds open. if you have a problem with what people wear or don’t wear in their own homes, don’t look in their windows.

your daughter also did nothing wrong - curiosity is a cornerstone of childhood, and pointing and laughing is a pretty natural and innocent response from a 6-year old. she saw a naked woman. that’s totally natural. i guess america is different, but growing up, i saw naked women all the time! on the beach, in changing rooms, tanning on public lawns, and so on. it’s just... truly not a big deal. there’s nothing inherently sexual about being naked, and kids won’t see anything wrong with it unless you teach them it’s wrong.

you didn’t do anything wrong in letting her know - but i think the important thing for me is what you were hoping to achieve. did you truly just want to give her a heads up? or were you actually trying to say “The Children shouldn’t have to see that, close your blinds so i don’t have to bother teaching my kids that looking in people’s windows isn’t super appropriate, and can mean you see unexpected things”?

if you genuinely just wanted to let her know, so she could prevent it from happening again if SHE so desired, no assholes here.

but i kind of get the vibe that you brought it up to get her to close her curtains, so the kids wouldn’t have to be exposed to something as natural as a naked woman. in her own home. which makes YTA.

edit: i’m feeling a little left out tbh, this made it to the top and i’m like the only person OP didn’t pick a fight with, haha.

to all the people ‘genuinely asking’ if it would be the same if a) it was a man swinging his dick around or vigorously masturbating or b) if this woman was having sex as though those situations are analogous - while you’re clearly being deliberately obtuse, there is obviously a difference between sexual acts in full view of the street, and simply existing while naked for a few moments in your living room.

also, shoutout to the guy who PM’ed me asking if there’s really naked women everywhere in scandinavia, and if so, where specifically."

bopcai,"YTA to such a degree that you drove me to comment on this sub after lurking for a long time.

I am a father and a husband, and I will say that I agree that fatherhood and motherhood are different, but not in the ways you claim. I try my hardest to raise my kids and be a good partner to my wife. We both work, we split the housework relatively evenly, we try to have equal time with our kids. At the end of the day though, I can never understand what my wife is going through. She had the added burden of creating our children and being constantly judged for every choice she made by everyone from friends to random strangers sitting next to us at restaurants. Now, things still can't be equal, no matter how hard we try to make them, because the bar is always lower for me. If I pack a sandwich for my kid, I'm dad of the year for doing the bare minimum. If my wife packs a sandwich, the teacher asks why she left out carrots and a juice box to make it a balanced meal. I get praised for putting my kid's hair up. My wife gets criticized for not properly laying our toddler's edges.

Fatherhood and motherhood are not equal because there is a higher bar for moms that leads to constant pressure and stress that you and I can never really understand. However, we can work just as hard as our wives to be the best parents we can to our children, and yes, that includes anticipating their needs, doing mental labor, AND supporting our partners through motherhood while they face a million criticisms that we will never have to hear.

Do better, and be better to your girlfriend, if only because your daughter will eventually understand that you treat her mother like crap and won't want you around when she's older."
bopdre,"Dude, dude, dude.  NAH.  You'll get their ashes.

Their bodies will be treated with utmost respect.  Students and researchers who are allowed the privilege of working with cadavers go through serious training sessions in how to respectfully work with bodies, and how to handle the conflicting emotions that might arise within them.  They are taught to feel gratitude for the people who gave them the opportunity to learn skills that will permit them to do research or practice medicine that could one day save lives.

The schools that use the donated bodies usually have a ceremony/service once a year for the family and friends of those who donated.  If you can, go to one of these services and see how your parents will one day be remembered and thanked for their donation.

The school cremates the bodies afterwards, and will return the ashes to you.

You can have a service or ritual upon their deaths, just as is usually done.  Their bodies are not present, but nowadays having a body present during a funeral isn't always how it is done.

I urge you to contact the organization that is handling their donation.  They welcome contact with family members who have questions and concerns.  Call your parents and ask them who is handling their donation.  Speaking to a representative of the organization will help you understand why your parents' choice is not scary, not macabre, but a *generous gift.*"

Edit: for the record there are some fancy as fuck ear plugs out there that you can get special for your ears. Just saying."
bord00,YTA for not telling us what it is. This is the internet my friend and you owe us an explanation.
bordd8,"ESH. His family sounds god-awful, but you didn’t need to make that comment to your boyfriend, even though you *were* right, “I told you so” comments have never, in the history of anything, gone over well."
borf7e,"NTA, she looks a bit crazy. Unless she can afford breaking expensive phones."
borm1i,YTA. Why do I get the feeling that this is about you and not your nephew? Your nephew seemed delighted so why did you feel the need to return it?
bornuq,"I don’t even know, y’all sound so fucking dysfunctional"
boro63,"NAH 

No one is an asshole for having feelings. She also taught you a good lesson that friends are the worst people to work with on a group project. 

Work with people you’re unfamiliar. That way, you don’t feel guilty when you blow their phone up at 4am depending their completed parts that’s due at midnight."
boro6h,"NAH. It makes sense that your Mom is pissed; this is going to drive an even bigger wedge between her and her sister. That being said, invite who you want to your wedding.

However if your Mom pays for most things, she may want more say in your guest list."
boroh1,"NTA

It's good your mom got to hear the truth,  and it sounds like your whole agrees this is an issue for her."
borotf,NTA he should be thanking you always for doing that for him.. if he's not normally thankful than this was in hopes you'd keep driving him
borpa8,"NAH. I think you should let him get his sleep, since it sounds like he works odd hours and must be exhausted. Talk to him about how you feel; maybe you can schedule some special family outings or meals with a ""no phones"" rule. If you're still frustrated, maybe you can talk it out together with a counselor. Sounds like normal stress that comes from having a 1-year old, so good luck!"
borpf9,"YTA. If you pretend to be someone else, you'll eventually slip up and your SO will realize they aren't dating who they think they are. 

It's fine to not know who you are, but changing to suit who you like won't help you figure it out."
bors4l,NTA. That’s fucking creepy. Weird pedophile vibes
borsf9,"That's a pretty shitty delivery tip. If you live in North America, YTA."
borvas,"YTA.  You don't get to ""save"" seats on public transportation.  Other people pay the same fare as you."
borvg7,"ESH here. Your wife sucks for disturbing your sleep by watching TV. You suck by disturbing your wife’s sleep by watching TV.

I think that you two should have a calm conversation about this, even though you find your wife’s actions to be selfish."
borz5x,"YTA. The car runs, gets you from point a to point b without exploding, and has AC. And it’s new. What more could you possibly ask for?

Edit: you may use your own money to get the specific cars you want."
bos15g,[deleted]
bos1yp,NTA I would definitely bring it up
bos48q,ESH. You guys both seem kind of insecure and untrusting in this relationship.
bos93c,"NTA

They honestly sound insufferable at times."
bosdeq,"YTA for waiting this long to have a goddamn conversation with people. From your post it seems you've made no attempt at bringing it up to them before this point or expressing displeasure. Some people have a higher tolerance to filth, and the only way to find a good middle ground in situations like this is *communication* which it seems you really suck at."
boshyw,"NTA at all. I feel the same way.

Your MIL shouldn't be in your bedroom snooping."
bosluu,NTA. Just because it’s a minor inconvenience for you and may not really matter doesn’t mean that it’s not rude of them. You said it nicely. The doorway is not a place to stand.
bosqkq,"NTA.  Your wedding, your decision.  

Your biological mother didn't offer and couldn't help, and instead made things harder for you.  

Your step mother has been making this about you (as it should be for your wedding) and it is nice of her.  You should be able to accept any help someone offers.  

Heaven forbid someone helps you on your wedding."
bosr7m,"INFO. We don’t know what your relationship was like before they moved. Was she a good, doting mother? A narcissist? A hands-off parent or a helicopter parent? Did you have a good relationship?

I used to spend EVERY holiday and vacation to go visit my husband’s family who (initially) lived a 7 hour drive from us. We made the trip nearly every month for several years. I later discovered, despite never doing a thing for myself and them not reciprocating the trip , that they complained if we ever spent time off with my family. That was it for me.

You ultimately need to do what’s right for you. You can’t prioritize people who didn’t prioritize you. A 5 hour buffer is damned significant."
bostp5,[deleted]
bosvxt,"NAH. Your wife probably doesn’t see visiting her family as a true vacation for herself. Could you propose something to the effect of each of you taking a 10 day vacation 100% for yourselves within the next two years or so?

Edit: I am assuming this would be financially possible for you based on the fact that you talked about spending a few weeks overseas like it was no biggie."
bot13s,"NTA.

To be honest, he sounds insecure and immature.

I don’t see why he should care about what sex toys you have."
bot2us,NTA. It's been six years. Initial suspicion and hesitation is fair but at this point it's gone too far and they need to move on from the age thing.
botbeb,"NTA
You have work to get done, and had a rough day. The cat prevents you from doing work and unwinding. Does your girlfriend know her cat acts like this to you?"
bote2b,NTA. Report her.
botg9s,NTA to ask what you feel you are worth and the owner is a bit greedy to ask you to do it for a reduced gym membership.  However $500 per session if 20 people show up is a bit steep in my view.
botgv8,NTA.  Has your non-binary friend actually asked the dog what it prefers?
botjwg,"NTA. However, you should have let them say goodbye."
botjz1,"YTA- when you do something to be an asshole, you're the asshole.. I'm not sure how you thought anything else"
botkq7,"NTA. Omg I would cry if someone thought of my favorite band and got tickets for me. You are an amazing daughter, don't you fucking forget it."
botmri,NTA. Consider yourself validated.
botofm,NTA it's a big assumption to think that they're moving in with you for **8 months** out of the year.
botpko,"YTA - so you'll loan him a camera to take shots of you, but you wont go to the library for him? Sounds to me like you don't do favors unless theres a guaranteed pay off for you."
botq52,"NTA - I'd suggest both a standard door handle lock and a chain lock if you can manage to install it. If you don't feel secure and you need a safe space, there's absolutely no shame in locking your door, especially since he pulled a ""my house""."
botqc7,NTA. You’re dating a man-child.
bott7u,"NTA - it was your laptop and you said your brother was perfectly content with what he had. Plus it’s Mother’s Day week, and that’s a great gift for your mother"
botwpe,"NTA, you made a responsible choice"
botxcy,"NAH - she didn’t say you couldn’t do better, she said you wouldn’t try and you agreed with her"
botxfb,NAH you can ask to not pay for the full week but depending on how it’s structured you might have to. Nobody **wants** to pay for things that they’re not using.
bou0r4,"NTA but if you can't come to an agreement on this, maybe don't move in with her?"
bou0sy,"Due to limited charaters in OP I couldnt state that I have 10+ years as a mechanic, so no shade tree here."
bou0td,"If you’re not withholding any of the story, you’re not the asshole. I’d fight it."
bou472,"YTA

She is your wife. She is the mother of your kids and also a part of your family. By not giving the family recipe to her, you’re saying she’s not a part of the family

Edit: typo"
bou8iv,"ESH. He’s an asshole for being a shitty dad, but YTA (or you would be) for trying to sell him a part of your liver. If you don’t want to donate it you don’t have to but trying to sell it to him seems a little shady to me. I’m also fairly sure that selling a body part is illegal."
bou9y8,"YTA - Your friend was the one who brought up the thing about the weight in the first place, and it's ridiculous if you think looks aren't a big part of why people date each other. The second half of his comment was bad, but overall it seems you went way off the rails for what was probably a poor attempt at humor."
boueqf,"NTA 

It clearly isn't a problem for them to do that since they did it the last 6 times. Did you ask to speak to a manager about it to find out what the issue is? If it continues to be a problem then tell them you'll take your business elsewhere."
boufcy,NTA- you shouldn't ask someone that just broke up with this. It would suck having a friend do this.
boug1d,I’d go towards no assholes here and that you two are just not compatible. You’ve both expressed your boundaries and they don’t match up. This happens a lot and the easiest thing to do is move on before one/both of you become the asshole through resentment.
bouklx,NTA. She is a child and she needs her mom. Good job.
boull7,"NTA. However, prepare for massive blowback if you do this. Your gf might get mad, this dude may not believe you, literally so much drama could unfold from you doing this stranger a favor. If you choose to do so, just prepare yourself for this."
boum5r,I would say NTA. Get clean but help encourage them to get clean too. You cant be responsible for what they do and you should think about life for yourself expecially if you're struggling to survive. Maybe you leaving will be a wake up call for them to do what's right because they wont survive without your income.
bouqvh,"YTA

Music concerts come and go but you only ever get one family. Not really sure how you can even consider prioritising a gig over family.

You may not have considered yourself close to your niece but clearly your sister considers you close enough to assume you would be going.

Maybe think that your sister wants you there for support because clearly she does."
bouuji,YTA. She’s 11. There’s a goddamn learning curve. This is where you *teach her how to be responsible*. What are you teaching her by doing this? That when she messes up mommy and daddy take the things she loves away? You’re awful parents.
bouw5v,"NTA - man I see so many dog owners take their dogs off lead where they shouldn't and its so dangerous. Too many times you hear stories of people getting bitten or other pets getting attacked and killed. As someone who lost his dog because some asshole didn't keep his dog on a lead and they mauled him to death, thank you for reporting it."
bouwlz,"NTA and I'm really having trouble not to say a shitstorm of nasty things about your mother. This is your graduation, that's something that should be burned in her agenda for years now."
bov19s,NAH it’s ok to be upset but not angry; I think parents should be able to talk to their kids about what’s going on in the family... and it’s important to know what kind of a person your dad really is.
bov1qu,[deleted]
bov2ny,"NTA, in my opinion! You were only saying what you saw to two friends, and your boss and coworker are the ones acting shifty about it. I’m sorry she got on you like that."
bov64t,"YTA. Your kid, your responsibility. You're expecting him to do what his father should be doing. If he wants to relax and you're pinning your duties on to him, you're definitely the ass hole."
bov7qr,"NAH. But you do need to work this issue out if you want your relationship to continue. The current situation, where

1. you don't want to sleep in the same bed as him
2. him thinking this is because you are less interested in him

**will** lead to the end of the relationship, if it is not fixed. You can try fixing either of the two points, but one of them **must** be fixed."
bov8gp,NTA.  Just move the PS4 into another room for a week?
bovay6,"NTA. He has misophonia, which must be difficult to deal with, but it is his problem and not yours. It's up to him to have his headphones charged/or get a back up like ear plugs to use during meal times. 

You can't eat silently, it's physically impossible. He can stop himself from hearing it. So the only solution is for him to plan in advance for mealtimes."
bovbi6,[deleted]
bovdq0,"YTA

Let the hospital know you are paying out of pocket and not through insurance, and ask if there's a way you can get the bill discounted or put on an affordable payment plan.

The debt isn't going to disappear simply because you don't want to pay it."
bovhd8,"NAH. Your wife is insecure for her own reasons and you seem like an understanding man. However, I don't think you should let this affect your work relationships. As long you (or the girl) don't develop feelings for each other, don't do anything weird, you should have nothing to hide"
boviro,"YTA - he loves this job. Don't tell him to quit, he is not your son. However, you can express you concerns without telling him what to do. And without guilt tripping him. It's not up to you to decide what he does. You only get to decide what you do. If his job is a deal breaker for you, then move on. If it isn't, just be happy you met such a compassionate person."
boviz2,YWBTA. This is a lot to lay at the feet of another person for no reason at all. This is something better saved for a diary or journal.
bovjbb,"NTA. Your dorm, your choice."
bovnbj,"NTA. You couldn't have known it was him, and it applies to anyone else living in your quarters. If anything, your flatmate is TA for chastising you."
bovt7k,NTA-she is a huge asshole and your friends are acting like immature teenagers
bovtpm,What?
bovu57,Info: how old are you? Was this always the plan? Does she know she’s going to have to get a cab alone? Where is she getting a cab from? Who says you’re the asshole?
bovvtg,NTA. Sounds like it’s time to get your own place.
bovx5i,"YWBTA. This isn’t the same as just asking your wife to get a job - that would be understandable. Asking her to go back to a job in sex work that she hated? Not okay.

Have you looked into any kind of assistance? It would seem that since the children lost their mother, there should be some sort of assistance offered."
bovzwv,Why are you friends with her?
bow20d,"NAH

He’s trying to assert dominance over you. Only one man can control the AC.

Kill him if you have to"
bow38y,"NTA- "" She even blocked me on all social media just so I wouldn’t hear anything or seen anything from her. ""

&#x200B;

this and other things from your narrative make her sound childish. It SEEMS that THIS year she kind of set the circumstances up to be the victim. Some more communication would have helped here."
bow65q,"""Hate the feeling"" does not mean you ""can not"", it means you WILL not. That's making an excuse, not giving a reason. The burden is not shared equally between you, and your excuse is lame. YTA"
bow8cz,"YTA your friend was helping you out by paying for you. Also its not like it was a small independent business, they won't miss a couple of bucks. All you had to do was keep your mouth shut. If you felt guilty go give some money to a charity that need the money more."
bow93f,"Oof what did I just read? I had to reread twice. :)

NAH. nobody at fault. You haven't signed the contract yet, no obligations. They could also cancel if they wanted to. Your reasons why are a bit confusing though, no clue what you're on about there.

They (the company) are also not assholes. (and why would they be) So NAH."
bow9mj,"NTA - Anyone can park anywhere on a public street, subject to any parking restrictions."
bowizy,"YTA - your mom isn't your personal driver, to be kept waiting at your whim. You're lucky she's willing to pick you up in the first place. Apologize and try to show some appreciation that she doesn't make you walk or take a bus home on the regular."
bowk63,NTA. I feel like that’s obvious. You did what you were told to do because you believed it’s what they wanted you to do.
bowl2f,"NTA She sounds like a spoiled bi...rd. Also there might be a good chance that her BF didn't win any trip at all, she seems manipulative enough to make it up."
bowoo4,ESH. She should have responded by now but you would suck if you rescinded the offer without notice.
bowrtb,NTA. What they are saying could definitely be considered racist. It is perfectly reasonable to ask them to stop and it shouldn't be hard to do that.
bowse7,"NTA, if indeed he needs to find another job. But telling him straight as he woke up wasn't very subtle. Maybe. 

Also, I don't know what ""game"" you are talking about. Maybe he needs to look at himself and admit that yes, he can be criticised without him jumping to ""racist"" ?"
bowssy,[deleted]
bowtv0,"Is that even a question? YTA, his wrongdoing doesn’t excuse you being an asshole."
bowvbr,"NTA.
Not an asshole at all. What’s odd is how willingly they stopped being your friend."
