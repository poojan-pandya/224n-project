There’s being a bad pet owner, and then there’s being bad to other people’s pets as well."
box3gz,"NTA.

We don’t have to like everyone."
boxbb6,"YTA. She made an honest mistake and did her best to rectify it. There is never an excuse for taking out your stress on a loved one (more so when they aren't the cause of those issues).

You need to apologize, no excuses."
boxbi3,"NTA. Your party, your invites. Your house, your rules. They're making this into a bigger deal than it is. You have clear reasons for having two smaller parties."
boxcfi,"YTA - Stand for something or you’ll fall for anything. Given the chance, management will do the same to you."
boxka0,"NTA for laying your cards on the table, though I'm not sure how I feel about your specific cards."
boxlqh,NTA she should be waiting to see when you’ll talk to her again....
boxmfu,"I’m gonna go with NAH. I understand your frustration but I think you should reframe what you think she’s doing. If she took 30-60 a month and used it to “treat herself” by getting a coffee every morning, going to the spa, getting a massage, getting her nails done, going to a movie, buying something for a hobby, etc, would you have the same reaction? If so, then that’s not a very healthy attitude to have because everyone needs a little self care. I don’t think you’d be an asshole to mention the amount but in a loving way to remind her of how much she’d spent and make sure that she is comfortable with how much she spent. If she’s comfortable with that and it’s not cutting into needed money, let it go and just think of it as a way she treats herself. Of course, there’s a limit to how much one can afford to “treat themselves” so make sure you both have an understanding of that monetary limit and both of you follow that limit."
boxqns,NAH sucks to be you right now.. but i guess your sister wont really care if you get her a new kitten from a shelter or wherever you want to get one.. yes it wont be the same but after a few days she will probably love it just as much
boxzei,"YTA for assuming that your sons would be incestuous, that's weird dude"
boy8f8,YTA. It was his. He said he wanted it and you ate it anyway. Dick move honestly in my opinion.
boy96n,NAH. It’s fine that he’s disappointed and it’s fine that you don’t feel comfortable going.
boybsi,NTA and technically she didn't cheat with you.... So you'll only get your head kicked in for no reason.... Usually im all for telling but on this occasion I think you need to put your safety first....
boyd6h,"YTA. So you took off from work to spend the day with her but you haven't made any plans and expect her to just sit at home and do what? If you want her to spend the day with you, plan something to do. Sitting in the house is not celebrating."
boykez,"NTA. That’s the thing about any sort of activism — you can’t just champion or stand in defense/support of only those you like. If you’re calling yourself a feminist, you have to be for all women, not just everyone excluding a boyfriend’s exes. She’s allowed to not like her, she’s entitled to her feelings, but to call her a whore, bitch, slut, etc is abhorrent. Using those clearly and horribly sexist and misogynistic terms while being a steadfast “feminist” is mind boggling to me. Good on you for calling her out on this. She needs to correct herself and do it quickly.

EDIT: Everyone who is challenging that there is one way to be a feminist is right. There is no right way to be a feminist. We all have our path. All women are so conditioned in opposition of our own progress. This doesn’t mean she doesn’t hold feminist values, as so proven by the wonderful work she does, OP. That should not and can’t be excluded. She has a right and deserves a chance to digest and learn."
boyq6x,NAH. It's a personal choice. Everyone is entitled to their own feelings.

boyrfh,"NTA because of the way you said it, assuming you phrased it like that and didn’t actually call her a slut. Don’t call her a slut. But pointing out the double standard is fair game."
boyrtm,"NTA,  if someone puts information on social media they shouldn’t assume the same info is still private."
boysgj,"NTA - start charging him more knowing you’ll be making them for him to sell. It’s not a bad the he’s selling them, but it’s shitty that he would hide it and try to make more than you."
boyvkn,"NTA, but only because you're willing to pay for the upgrade.  However, it doesn't seem like it's the fact that it's a twin size that's the problem, because 5'10 isn't exactly tall.  It sounds like it's the cheap mattress that's the problem.  Maybe he objects to the amount of extra space he'd lose with the bigger bed.  Try offering just to buy a new twin mattress.  A good one."
boyx1z,"Ugh, NTA. This is ridiculous. You're moving, not hosting a family party! The only people who should be there are the people who are actually helping you move."
boyylq,"NAH, especially since you're making an alternative for him.  I'd suggest making a lactose free mac and cheese for the 2 y.o. so he thinks he's eating the same as everyone else.

Edit: meant to type NAH, not NTA"
boyzue,"NTA.  You're not paying for her to be alive, you're paying for a fancy car and cigarettes."
boz05f,"NTA. You share a house, you both need mutual respect of each other's boundaries. If her family doesn't give notice in time they can't stay plain and simple.  I hate surprise guests."
boz1wy,"NTA.

Your friend hid the bottle there, not you. You did nothing wrong and the idea that this is your fault is ludicrous."
boz320,"NTA, I don’t really get what’s going on here, but if she’s abusing cats and being an asshole to a sick person.... could be ESH, would need more INFO"
boz7ws,"NAH - If you can and will use them, you are not an asshole for taking them. 

Also:

>$6000-7000 retail value in textbooks

Sounds like you only took 3 books anyways."
boz84k,"NTA.  She wants to accommodate her family and keeps offering up the place like a hotel.  It's nice that she wants to help out, but She's had people crash every weekend and that adds to utilities.  You want the living arrangement that you signed up for."
bozc8r,"NAH.

He can be upset, and you can be not upset.
It’s not a very important thing in the grand scheme, because it’s not long term.
Just focus on getting past it.
Reassuring him of the situation’s impermanence will probably help him."
bozdg9,"YWBTA if you tell them. Respect their religion, you can have different opinions on it sure and you can express your opinions but they don’t have to follow them. Their relationships are THEIR relationships, not yours."
bozdkb,"NTA, it’s like telling her you caught a cold from a decade ago. If it curable no need to bring it up as its moot and doesn’t apply."
bozei3,"NTA.

&#x200B;

Your silence leaves the cause open to interpretation, by all of your co-workers. I would probably let the problematic co-worker know what your issue is, but you're not obligated to be chummy just due to working together, and I'd say you're being a pretty big person for still helping out her tables."
bozej3,"NTA. All four of OPS grown children couldnt even put thought into a CARD? Or some flowers?

I'd be rightfully upset also. It's not about materialism or gifts. It's about being appreciated and acknowledged"
bozen0,NTA - But honestly I would just stay out if it if I were you. You're gonna cause a lot of strife that you don't want to deal with. High school is a shitty time for everyone.
bozmq4,"NTA, but you should report the bus for not stopping on the curb like a normal driver would"
boznxq,Wait you mean to say they want you to take her on a shopping spree that you pay for? So she gets to go shopping and doesn’t have to buy anything? NTA I wouldn’t do that for anyone (with a couple exceptions)
bozr5f,"YTA. Frankly, I don't trust your assessment of your MIL or of your interaction with her because of how insanely immature and disrespectful you're coming off in this post. You honestly believe that you ""truly can't help"" agreeing to be ready at 6pm, but then not even getting out of bed until your husband dragged your ass out at 6:05pm? That's unacceptable, and you acting like it's his fault that you took forever to get ready because you ""had to start from scratch"" and he was ""bugging you"" is ludicrous. And then, when you finally got to the event that you made your husband miss, you spent the entire rest of the night playing a game on your phone? How old are you, 14?

FFS, OP. Grow up. This isn't cute or quirky, it's a character flaw that you should be working on."
bozr91,"NAH

You don't have to like anyone, and your friends don't have to dislike someone just because you don't like them. Sounds like the kid is a bit immature, but that's what kids tend to be. You might not be, but I bet he grows up eventually."
bozv01,"NTA

That doesn’t sound particularly safe and that should be the priority. I would’ve recommended not allowing it in the first place, but now that it’s here you’re NTA for deciding which things get to stay in your house."
bozz5f,"NTA - while cutting the grass is a perfectly reasonable chore for a couple of teens, it's not a chore until you're asked to do it."
bp0035,"NTA - Jesus thats too much. Is there any way you could turn off the tracking? 

Alternatively, mailing back your phone and getting your own plan sounds like a great plan."
bp003f,"YTA for how you address it.  You're looking at this as a financial step rather than considering that she's her own person with her own goals. Studying doesn't detract from her ability to be a mother, it simply changes her availability.  Being a stay-at-home parent is still work.  It's unpaid work.  If she pursues a PhD, she'll make it back over time.  She may be able to get some kind of stipend in exchange for teaching.  After a point, the expense is for her personal value and career happiness.  She may be able to get tuition exchange for your kids as a professor so it could actually save a ton of money in the future."
bp00np,NTA: Your parents are not your doctors. They have neither the expertise nor the right to determine what the correct medical intervention for your health needs are. That's between you and your doctor.
bp03ly,"NTA, she’s embarrassed that you called her out for it."
bp04ks,"YTA, don’t tell your friends they are undatable."
bp06w2,NTA. Their commute is not your problem.
bp08v5,"NTA by far. 

&#x200B;

Contact the police, file a police report and hit ever pawn shop in a 20 miles radius, I really hope you get your medals back. 

&#x200B;

I hope you get your son back someday too.  My eldest brother was a similar case, nix'd out of our lives for about 20 before semi-straightening out an getting back in touch.  Sadly, he fell back into drug addiction and passed a few years back."
bp0c2i,"NTA, however A 4-Plex is an awfully small pool of people to be making enemies. Seems like it would be easier to just take your detergent back and forth with your laundry. But I guess if it’s labeled bleach and they use it anyway then they deserve what they get."
bp0cj0,"NTA. Listen to your vet's suggestions, and make your decision off of their professional advice.

You have always given this pup a great life full of love and treats and head scratches. But sometimes, ensuring that your pet has a good life means making the decision to end that life, if it will be a painful and sedentary one. It's one of the hardest decisions you will ever make, but it is also sometimes one of the kindest.

&#x200B;

(edit: I meant NTA! Your family are being jerks!)"
bp0es4,"YTA, you would be an asshole. From what you said this is the only time his fiancée could get married other then Christmas without it being when she is taking classes. He told you he was fine with you guys not making it, and you didn’t say anything about that not being genuine, so don’t go."
bp0ffh,"YTA for insulting your hosts dinner. Very bad manners, and saying it’s not a meal because it’s not vegan?"
bp0ghe,"I know this title makes me look like a massive asshole but please read the full story.
______________________________________________________
I did. You still look like a massive asshole.

YTA"
bp0iv7,"YTA 

“Man these matches don’t seem that great.”

“Really, mine are great! Check them all out!”

Dick move in your part. She may have overreacted a bit but her anger in justified IMO."
bp0lxx,"Honestly, she never stops talking.  I been around her enough to know that while she is nice, she is a motor mouth.  She answers questions not even directed towards and domineers a conversation.  I want to hear what my niece has been up to.  

I also don't like the fact that she asked her daughter, who is doing something much more important, got get her an invite.  Never once in our conversation yesterday did she ask if she could join.  She mentioned spending time with her sister at the time I would be with my Aunt."
bp0trx,[deleted]
bp0v1l,NTA but you might forgo getting your deposit returned (as she may not clean on her own).
bp0w88,"Ehh.. NAH. You definitely could have moved, it wouldn't have killed you especially since you've seen the movie already but since that was your seat you didn't have to move. I understand why he was angry though since you originally said yes, then backtracked."
bp0yfm,"NTA - if she’s letting it fall into disrepair and says crazy shit to you, she might need more help than she currently getting. You’re just looking out for your property, and the complaints might actually highlight the fact that she needs more help."
bp0zqg,NTA - sounds like the person was just vying to post it first and get that sweet sweet karma (or likes or whatever). Sounds pretty fucking petty on their part.
bp10mn, NTA - it could of been a abusive parent looking for their kids
bp11ir,NTA at all. You and me both know that they would have never moved out if you didn’t do that. You need to explain that to your husband and he needs to stop feeling bad about it. They just wanted to free load.
bp13vc,"NTA.

They don’t support you enough to even believe your anxiety / panic attacks are real, and you (understandably) don’t trust them enough to be honest with them? They don’t sound like very good friends. I think you’re free to avoid Pride for whatever reason you want and don’t owe them any explanation."
bp141k,"NTA. If you're not enjoying it, why would you stay? Block the people who have been mocking you and move on."
bp14ai,Can we get a 3 sentence TL:DR? I never understand when people do dialogues with initials of characters I’ve just met
bp16oo,"NTA. If your friend refuses to attend without her abusive boyfriend, then that's on her."
bp16zk,"Definitely NTA, your father has some serious responsibility issues and clearly doesn't care to recognise them. It also sounds like he spent half of your childhood trying to antagonize your mother to you. I wouldn't let him 500 yards away personally."
bp1cfd,"NTA. What your gf is doing is super unhealthy and disordered. I would focus mostly on being concerned for her when you talk to her about it, but you definitely shouldn't eat that way yourself!"
bp1ebk,[deleted]
bp1hto,Idk if YTA but you're definitely an idiot
bp1ic3,"NTA. Your bf's brother, and now your bf, are just pissed that you are doing something nice for their mom, when it should be *them* doing something nice for their mom."
bp1j4t,"NAH

I get being a clean freak but if it's too the point where the slightest deviation from gives you literal anxiety then you might want to get therapy for that. 

You're not an asshole for that but I would really try to control it somehow because if you start having fights because she doesn't clean it exactly the way you like it you will most definitely become the asshole."
bp1lad,"NTA - You're PAYING for this education and the grades you get can have a significant impact on your future. Colleges act as if they are doing you a favor but they are providing a paid service and you deserve to get what you paid for.

Report the professor, not just for yourself but for the sake of your fellow students."
bp1ndf,NTA - but you would be the uncool cousin.
bp1pyu,"ESH. She was very inconsiderate by not communicating for 2 hours, and leaving for a 2 hour drive at 4, when she knew you had dinner plans. However, it seems like you just ghosted her.. why not tell her when she said she's leaving that you couldn't make it anymore? Would just be not TA had you told her you could no longer make it."
bp1q5c,"NTA. Work to change the contact arrangement if needed and if it's not fitting with your experience with the child now. It's not fixed for life after all. Talk to your attorney, or get one if you don't have one.

She's the asshole here. She denied you contact, now she wants to set all the terms of contact."
bp1qa0,"Really this is NAH.  Your friends shouldn't be expected to change because of a change that you made having a kid and wife, and you seem to think that too.  That's good.  They aren't the a holes, they can do what they feel like.  If they want to be alcoholics, let them.  As long they don't curse really badly or something in front of the kid, NAH."
bp1rd7,[deleted]
bp1sna,[deleted]
bp22zw,"YTA. For one thing, weight gain and headaches, fatigue and not feeling well may be due to a medical issue. Depression's a possibility, but it could be many physical illnesses as well. So your pushy attitude about her food and exercise is not going to be helpful to her at all.

B, what the hell does her having a male friend have to do with any of this? That's just some jealous controlling bullshit."
bp2cz3,"ESH. Put the whole god damn thing down so your shit and piss container isn't open for the world to see when you aren't using it.

&#x200B;

(Edit: this is @ both of you, FYI)"
bp2d1t,NTA... it's weird she thought 12 yr old kid looking at her = sexual awakening. Weird and ew.
bp2hci,"NTA 

&#x200B;

You each had different experiences with this woman.  To him she was wonderful, to you she was awful.  If you name your daughter after her, he'll be reminded of the wonderful woman who raised him, you'll be reminded of the woman who was terrible to you.  He needs to acknowledge that she's your daughter too, and you don't need to be reminded of the pain his grandmother cause you every time you say her name.

&#x200B;

>He was mortified and assured me repeatedly that she wasn’t like this when she was younger and he had no idea where that came from. I don’t think she was ever formally diagnosed with dementia, but he swore that that’s what it was, he didn’t recognize her, she didn’t raise him that way, she used to be extremely welcoming and kind to all, had friends of all races, etc. I know it wasn’t his fault and you can’t reason with dementia, so I never gave him a hard time and just avoided her. 

&#x200B;

 Most racists are pretty good at keeping it closeted until they perceive a ""threat"", a ""threat"" like a family member dating outside their race."
bp2igm,"NTA.  There are a lot of other ways to be involved in things without playing a sport, and with all the brain injuries around football I'd think they'd be happy you left.  It sounds like maybe they're trying to relive their glory days through you.  Sad"
bp2ohu,"NAH, you are entitled not to like it. If I'm right and an Edward, is involved in the first one I can see where it's hard to watch. I cant blame them for trying to get you into it but maybe they should show you more light hearted ones like Ouran High School which isn't violent"
bp2pnm,"> About a half hour later I get texts from her saying that I lied about ever showing up and that she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. She proceeds to block me on social media. I tell her that I saw her family there as proof that I was there, because she neglected to mention her family being there at all. She just ignores me.

Way more going on here man. IMO she's doing something shady. NTA."
bp2rhl,YTA. You sound entitled and think they should be grateful you're even cleaning up after your own dog.
bp2src,"NTA. 

even though you went against what your mom said that doesn’t make YTA. Your thinking about what’s best for your pet. You could’ve just released him into the wild- but instead you took the time to find someone who cares for animals."
bp2t8x,"YTA. Virginity means different things to different people, and sex isn't just penetration. In fact, if you think only penetration counts as sex, there's a solid chance you're pretty terrible at sex. Especially for LGBT folks, it's insulting to say that sex must include penetration."
bp2uu5,"YWBTA, unfortunately if you want to have a wedding and start a family with your fiancé, you should not go to your ex’s fathers funeral right before your wedding."
bp2w7h,"NTA

To be nice about it, Fuck this guy. Anyone who puts their religion ahead of their family deserves nothing of you."
bp2ye1,"i mean is it really valuable if people here say youre' NTA?  like everyone in that group has made it clear they'd think YTA if you do this.

I don't think the question is are you an asshole or not, it's ""are you willing to die on this hill?"""
bp33in,YTA - I've had a fair amount of gardening stuff delivered and if you have them drive over your grass with a few tons of dirt you should expect to have some damage. If you don't want to damage you should have it dumped in the drive and wheelbarrow it back and forth
bp36wt,"NAH but as someone who is also extremely introverted, word of advice, go anyways. I hate large groups, parties, etc. I can’t stand being around a lot of people for very long, but making an appearance is often enough. When someone wants you to go to a party make it clear that you don’t like lots of people and you feel very overwhelmed about that you’ll stop by for five minutes and do exactly that. Say hello to everyone then excuse yourself and leave. Most people will understand and just be happy you showed at all."
bp3a3l,"YTA. Prom is supposed to be a fun, lighthearted occasion, kind of your last high school hurrah. I understand you don't want to impose on your grandparents, and that's a valid reason - not wanting to invite a bunch of random people to their house, but maybe you should talk to your friends about moving the dinner somewhere else, in order to accommodate the extra people? That being said, if its a potluck, then the amount of food should be sufficient for the amount of people, seeing as everyone will bring something. Honestly, it seems like you're being a little uptight in regards to prom and to ""your group""."
bp3ac4,NTA - your son sounds quite selfish.
bp3all,It's not your job to pay for everything. She sounds quite selfish. NTA.
bp3axb,NTA. Never work for free.
bp3b1p,"NTA ""I also have the right to never speak to you again and have zero relationship with you once I move out. Just because you have the *right* to do something doesn't mean you should."""
bp3edw,I agree with your coworkers that you should report her anonymously. All of those reasons about the dogs safety are valid enough
bp3f1j,"He’s your brother? Of course he has spare keys to your parents house, you’re overreacting"
bp3gno,"NTA but I'm inclining towards NAH. You had good intentions and some good points. But unsolicited parenting advice is one of the worse unsolicited advice you can give. It doesn't matter if it's a brother or a random guy on the street, if you weren't asked for your input, don't give it. It's very rare that people take observations on their parenting positively when they didn't ask for them. 

Also, as I said you have some good points about the situation, but you must consider you might also be projecting your own childhood on your niece. So you're not objective either way. 

If you ever consider your niece to be neglected in any way, you can try to intervene. Of course, if it would ever be a case where she's under harm or potential harm you could get the authorities involved. Until then, you tried to offer your vision, it got rejected. Learn the lesson and leave them be. This is not your child, it's not your call."
bp3hdi,"NTA, just discuss these reasons with her; it’s perfectly reasonable."
bp3nzu,"I’m not going to say YTA but I think you need to go. Graduation is a big deal. There will be plenty of times in life you have to be in a crowd, so unless you wanna be a shut in, I think you need to see someone about managing your anxiety."
bp3sqa,"NTA- The key to a good and healthy relationship is communication,if you didn’t say anything it’d just build up and lead to resentment"
bp3tzm,"YTA - Next time it happens in front of you just go way over the line. Overreact big time. 

You probably only need to send the message once. You don't need to escort him around, just make it clear that messing with him is gonna make you bring the wrath. 

That's how I stopped by buddy in high school from getting bullied...followed the guy down the hall absolutely screaming at him at the top of my lungs during classes. Followed him all the way back to the class he was supposed to be in. Had 3 or 4 teachers stop teaching and come out into the hallway to see what the disturbance was. 

Never happened again."
bp3uj7,"NTA. It's not like you had been talking about going together for a while or even that you were her first choice for going to see it with. She can either find someone else, go alone or don't go at all. What she does is her choice."
bp3uqi,NAH here I guess? If it doesn't bother anyone just let it stand there
bp3v1l,YTA. You fucked up the rest of his school year over him saying you liked a girl? Really?
bp3vgi,"NTA

It is really weird that your friend is inserting himself the plans for you to buy property.

Nip that shit in the bud.  Tell him directly you are not going to be sharing the property with him, and to stop bringing it up."
bp3wpu,"NTA. Hell no, it was your Xbox. If anything, I commend you for not getting physical with them. I think you handled the situation impressively."
bp3xjq,"NTA. Their negligence cost him thousands of dollars worth of work. Tell them to fix it and don't be afraid to use the word ""malpractice."""
bp3ydg,"NAH It's a strategy game and it's weird to copy.  That being said, your friend obviously thinks highly of your strategy and skill at the game or he wouldn't be copying you.  Maybe just don't share your strategy in the future."
bp47gl,"NTA for having concerns and voicing them.

YTA for having an issue with her going out once a week. You're not her keeper. I feel like if you had other social outlets instead of relying on the ladyfriend you wouldn't be feeling so at a loss of her going out once a week. I suspect you would be equally as disgruntled at her going out if there wasn't a creepy coworker/DWI, because you're more concerned about your own needs here."
bp47l5,"NAH - This is tough and my family has been there too. You want to continue traditions. It may hurt them to continue them without your grandma.

Neither is right or wrong, just different approaches. I think everyone needs an open discussion (FaceTime or whatever) and to remember that what everyone wants is to be together, so how can that happen?"
bp48i2,[deleted]
bp48s8,"Blunt and honest, no you’re not exactly an asshole. But having special alone time kinda goes with either being single or having a very relaxed and open partner. My opinion. Under normal circumstances with relationships and marriage, you just lose that ability to say “see ya when I see ya.” It doesn’t work very well. There is going to be some awkwardness, and it’s because of your trip."
bp4b5v,[removed]
bp4d7n,"NTA

Treating living beings like living beings is the name of the game. I would say your observation about him not being able to handle your level of affection is accurate. 

To be fair, a lot of the world are speciesists and may treat humans different from animals... but I wouldn't want to personally indulge a relationship with someone that can't respect my original friend."
bp4dlp,"NTA, your parents are for trying to control you. 

Be ready for your parents to react negatively tho if they are this controlling."
bp4dtv,"NAH. You can share or hold back whatever you want but sharing your past is also an important part of reaching and maintaining a deeper part of friendships, and some people are going to be offended by you not wanting to share. I can't blame them for that, but I also can't blame you for not wanting to be defined by your past.

I have a somewhat similarly shady past, though not as extreme, and whenever I do share I do find that people their perspectives of me change rapidly. Nerdy mid twenties white guy, people make assumptions, and having spent some time in jail doesn't fit the image they create and that I've created for myself. So I tend not to share those parts either because it doesn't fit with how I want people to look at me and who I am now."
bp4fwj,"NTA. Obviously. 

Unless you're straight-up lying about what happened, you're not even close to being in the wrong here. The girl is actively trying to be offended about something."
bp4h7s,"NTA- if you truly believed that his parents were abusing him, then not helping them find him was the right call. It wasn’t your place to explain the details of the situation to the other friend."
bp4hp0,"Y’all are NTA. This situation is personal to me so no matter how many downvotes I get or how many people say you’re TA, you’re NTA in my book."
bp4mih,NTA. Childbirth is not a spectator sport. You have who YOU want there for YOUR medical procedure.
bp4nv9,"NTA 

>there have been multiple occasions when I haven't been able to use my Netflix account because she has been watching it while my family has too, effectively kicking me off my own account

I would have logged that shit out the very first time that happened."
bp4obi,"YTA. 

Dude, your mum probably used to do loads of shit for you when you were younger. Helping her out with some work on the house shouldn't be seen as a gift; that's the kind of shit I would expect to be doing for my parents when I grow up in return for everything they did for me. 

Not only that, by the sounds of it you didn't specify that moving the flooring was her Mothers' Day gift until after you'd moved it. You should definitely buy her something."

bp54pu,">There is no contract, lease, agreement, etc regarding how much time we are required to give each other when we move out.

There's always a contract. If you don't have a special one with specific clauses, you default to the landlord/tenant laws of your area.

2.5 weeks is not enough time. Most laws state 30 days notice prior to moving out. 

Your roommate is most likely well within their rights legally to ask you for 30 additional days of rent and this makes them not an asshole to do so. 

You put your roommates in a tight spot. Did you know that you were moving in 2.5 weeks for a while and told no one until now? If so YTA."
bp55u0,"YTA. IMO this is a perfect example of how you can be “right” and still be an asshole. Yes, you paid for the room, including the right to recline your seat.

bp645z,"YTA because this reeks of incel BS. You call them Chads and call yourself a nice guy. Why the fuck do you care that they are drinking? It's none of your business, and underage drinking does not make you a bad person and is a completely normal college activity. Following the rules does not make you a good person. Ask them to lower their volume if it truly disrupting your work or if it is past quiet hours. Try talking to them like actual humans rather than dehumanizing them by labelling them as Chads. The fact that you think being a virgin has ANYTHING to do with any of this is delusional."

You asked your boss three days in a row if he had talked to his wife about whether he was coming or not. You also only invited four people. It's not some massive wedding where you need to plan out where everyone is going to sit and how many people are eating what meals. It's four guys coming for steak and shrimp.

I think it was disrespectful for him to continuously pressure you to change religions, after not only telling him that you didn’t want to, but after being accepted into a Muslim school. It really seems to spit in the face of the entire institution that he’s attending. I think you did the right thing by telling the teacher about it, and he was warned about it.

[Dor Yeshorim](http://doryeshorim.org/) screens for 9 diseases and costs $275.

[JScreen](https://jscreen.org/) covers 200 diseases and costs $149.

Considering the risks, I think it is perfectly reasonable to tell any Jewish dates ""Look, I know I am a Tay Sachs carrier and I don't want to get involved with anyone who might also be a carrier.  If after a few dates we both think there is potential, I'd like you to get screened like I did."" Tay Sachs is a big enough issue in the Jewish community that I think any Jewish dates will understand.

And it isn't like gentiles have no risk of Tay Scahs.  French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns have carrier rates similar to those of Ashkenazi Jews.

bpe4ty,"YTA but not because of the interaction with the lady. Tennis courts are not dog play areas, the park was on leash, stop breaking rules because you think you’re some exception. 

People like you that let your dogs off leash in an on leash area are why there’s so many more no dogs allowed at all parks."
bpe58d,"NTA,

Idk what a mudroom is but assuming she has blankets and a warm shelter you’re not neglecting the dog."
bpe5it,"NTA. If you feel unsafe, report. You don't want to fuck around with threats of violence."
bpe5xy,"NTA but if you’re having issues with her already and you’ve not even moved in, I’d be running a mile!"
bpebqq,"NAH, but be more careful next time and make sure you can 100% go. It sucks to have someone cancel that late for a big event but you had little to no choice."
bpecnb,"NAH, unfortunetly, nothing you can do, we all have weirdo co workers who aren't bad people, they just have poor social skills."
bpeio2,"Ywbta. Unsolicited comments on someone's health and/or eating habits is almost never not-assholey.

If you want to talk to him about company budgets do it professionally, without bringing in his personal drinking habits."
bpeky9,"NTA... but you're an idiot if you don't cash that. I'm sorry, no amount of ""rationalization"" would make me agree that you shouldn't cash that check. If you're angry? Sounds like a great time to cash that check. Happy? I have an idea. Cash that check. Don't know how to feel? I'll bet you can figure it out as you go out. To do what? Cash that fuckin check."
bpeno9,"NTA.
It's your party and from your description of him he's an acquaintance more than a friend

However, you may have to deal with flak from your other friends if ""Dick"" is excluded.
Your decision not to include him may force you to justify your position. As a result you'll either have your friends agreeing/understanding/supporting your position or others thinking you're being unnecessarily exclusionary. 

Either way, NTA."
bpenzy,"This is complicate but I'm going with NAH. You have a right to be uncomfortable and voice it to your brother, but he has a right to keep his own relationships. 

As long as the relation your brother has with your ex is completely disconnected from you, I think you're both in the clear."
bpepy1,"YTA.  You admit that you move the car for delivery people.  That means they have to see your note, call you and then wait for you to come out and move your car so they can do their job.  A job that is often on a very tight schedule.  You should make other arrangements just like everyone else"
bpeq4s,"NTA, but the next time someone starts following you, drive to a police station or drive around until they lose interest in you. Some people get violently aggressive, and it’s not worth the risk of injury or death to see what they have to say."
bpeqko,[removed]
bpewi6,"NAH— I understand that this is detrimental to your mental health, and I can see why you would want to remove yourself from the situation. But it is also difficult to leave an abusive relationship, for fear of escalating the abuse. Is it possible that you could hold on until this guy goes to boot camp, and then help your friend block his numbers and change her locks? Ghosting might be her only way out of this.

I don’t know that you haven’t had this conversation with her, but you don’t mention that you have. Please don’t cut her off without doing so. She’ll feel like it’s her fault, not his, and that might make her cling to a bad relationship because she doesn’t want to be abandoned."
bpexqz,NTA. If she acted like a mom and you consider her a parent figure then you should be able to make a card for her. A complete overreaction from your mom.
bpf0ko,NTA.. but you should point out that you will steal their souls..
bpf0xy,[deleted]
bpf3vg,"YTA (but not a major one)

Don’t touch things that don’t belong to you."
bpf6j6,"NTA. But if you can't concentrate on any work with your girlfriend around, how is living together going to work out?"
bpf6u4,"ESH - grow up dude. Yes the kid was in the wrong and his mother sounds like a handful but you’re an adult and the way you reacted was inappropriate from an adult

If you really wanted to make a point you should have reported the damage to the police seeing as you knew who was responsible."
bpfbf2,"NAH. It's definitely a shitty situation, and maybe could have not specifically mentioned the hospital bills. Personally I think 13 is old enough to handle these truths though. But there's a limit to what can be bought for him realistically. 

Also at the same time you've said you've been spoiling him, so also makes sense he's going to keep asking for things as well. 

All in all I'd chalk it up to it being an all around shitty situation more than anyone being an asshole."
bpfey0,YTA. Have you ever heard of insurance? Or license plates? Or filing claims? Or cameras? Or being an adult?
bpfi20,"You really don’t know their situation. I would really, really hesitate to call police in at this point. I understand the impulse to want to help, but unfortunately even if their home life isn’t great, getting the law involved could initiate a process that might make things exponentially worse for them.

Do you know anyone who speaks their native language? Could you maybe bring them along with you one day to try to get a better sense of whether the girls are OK?"
bpflik,"Jesus you can really tell school is out the last few days.

&#x200B;

ESH because the sub is filled with whiny teenagers complaining about relationships that won't exist after the summer. Go do what you want. If he doesn't like it, fuck him. You're 17, there will be many, many more boyfriends."
bpfo3l,"YTA you're 34 stop acting like a child. Nahha I don't look 40 people think I look 28, cause I apparently quiz everyone about how old they think I and everyone else look. WTF is wrong with you that you involved co-worker/student in this childishness. 

Oh here's a new flash to be polite people guess 5-7 years younger then they think if you're gossiping about someone they might go older to ""dish"" with you."
bpfp2x,What do French people look like?
bpfzut,NTA. Give notice if you can. But if you're sitting around unhappy and not making commissions then there's no reason for you to stay.
bpg0ky,"YTA. If the parking was supposed to be assigned, it would be assigned. Stick with your ""just park and go to work"" inclinations."
bpgive,"NAH

You made plans around her plans.  Her plans changed, so she asked if yours could too.  There's nothing wrong with her asking, because if she doesn't ask then the answer is no.  You can't move the contractor, so your plans can't change.  That's life as an adult.  It sucks that she can't have as fun a day on her exact birthday, but it's not like you won't be celebrating with her at all."
bpgk2s,"ESH. She really shouldn’t be doing that - but seriously, what the fuck? Just because someone’s being stupid doesn’t mean you should follow suit."
bpgn8d,"NTA this guy sounds like a creepster, honestly."
bpgoya,"ESH, as long as you told this story accurately. However, my guess is you're leaving out a lot of detail surrounding your behavior."
bpgqc6,[deleted]
bpgujr,"NTA:

>Personally, I believe that calling the costume racist reduces the character to just a black superhero, instead of just being a superhero who is super cool and a king and also happens to be black.

As a black person myself, I sort of agree with this, although the wording did throw me off a bit. He's a bit more than just ""happens to be black"".

Also, the girl that compared your costume to a Native American headdress is stupid, in my opinion...Native American headdresses have been around for hundreds of years and have huge traditional and symbolic meaning, so I totally get why wearing those to be ""fashionable"" could be considered offensive. On the other hand, the Black Panther movie is barely over a year old. It's a great movie for the black community, but the black community isn't defined by it."
bph1jw,NTA.  Cover yourself.  I don’t see how anyone could say you are doing something wrong in having a back-up.
bph2zh,"NTA, but I absolutely wouldn't frame it as ""stop talking about being gay"", but rather ""please stop disrupting me while I do my work"". He is allowed to speak about being gay, even if it is excessive to others, as it may be a point of pride for him. But idgaf what he's talking about, he shouldn't be bothering others in class."
bph8fp,"ESH.  Irene sucks for cheating.  Your ex sucks for helping her cheat, but you had no right to be angry at him when you weren't dating.  Slow dancing doesn't mean anything.  Irene's fiancé deserves to know that she's been cheating.  It's better for him to have the knowledge before he goes through with the wedding than try to get an annulment or file for divorce after."
bphgsl,"NTA. At all. He acted super creepily towards you, on multiple occasions, over the span of multiple years, despite you repeatedly asking him to stop. Ignore the heck out of him."
bphh65,"Of course you are NTA. You sister paid an idiot tax of $100. Tell her you never got the item you paid for, and if she was any other seller this would be fraud. If she wants to continue being an asshole, just don’t talk to her anymore."
bphi10,"NAH - hard to plan a destination wedding like that but they also can't to expect everyone to drop everything and attend, even more so when you're traveling alone and know no one there. I'd bring it up to him causally now. He may be very understanding about it and either say you're off the hook or allow you to bring your SO. And the earlier you bring it up, the easier it is for him to plan."
bphi9c,"NTA

Rita didn't care about your opinion when she put up her fence.  Why do you care about her's when you want to put up yours?"
bphjfk,"NTA - this is called being smothered. It isn't reasonable of him, and it's not your fault. If you're unhappy then you should end it."
bphl5d,"YTA - you basically told her that she and the faculty standing up for what they believe (and what is right)  is less important than you having your precious  free time. 

&#x200B;

BTW, she is doing this makeup schedule out of her free time, so that YOU ALL can pass your exam. You're an ungrateful little shit."
bphnq6,"Wrong sub really, but it's not really that shocking to say ""that would be disgusting"" if you were barely out of high school and he was in his 30's"
bphq1z,"NTA. It's weird as hell for your almost 50 year old dad to date a girl half his age, let alone someone in your social circle. He can find another 25 year old to date if he's that desperate for a younger girlfriend."
bphso1,"YTA. Internalized homophobia is a thing, being gay doesn't make you immune to homophobic thoughts."
bphwtb,"YTA - you offered a free ticket to someone. They were your tickets to offer. If you offer someone something free it shouldn’t be expected that they suddenly have to pay. You plan on going either way, no? What’s the harm in bringing your friend along."
bphyez,"How about asking your mother to pay for a small storage unit.  Since she is financially supporting him she then makes the choice.  Put it in storage, pay the first 2 months, give your mom the key.  Then it is up to your mom and brother to figure out what to do."
bpi03p,Do you seriously consider you're an asshole for having long hair and other people knowing you as the son of your mother? Validation post.
bpi2ck,Game of Thrones is the asshole for going out with a whimper.
bpi58o,"NAH

You are contributing to the household just as your husband is doing so.  Presumably, he likes not having to cook/clean/do that stuff, and having a lot more free time outside of work.  By not working, you too have free time to spend with him while still getting that stuff done.  That is the luxury that your work in the household is buying for your family."
bpi75l,"NTA.

I don't think you can ask her to reschedule the pictures, but your other suggestion -- show up after the party for the pictures -- is absolutely a good compromise and she's being difficult if she can't accept it. Stay firm and re-iterate that the party is not going to work, but you understand that the photos are important and you will make it work to be there at x time to be in the pictures."
bpi7v0,"You are all children, this is what children do... so I guess NAH... or maybe ESH. Whatever."
bpiaut,"NTA - the driveway is your property. You decide who gets to be on it. Even if they guy was nice and asked instead of telling you, taking 10-15 minutes to get the kids out is more then reasonable. Honestly, you could have left your car in that exact spot all day and not be the asshole"
bpice2,"NTA. I have a service dog, and I can tell you this is clearly a fake service animal. She is not only being an ass for having such a misbehaved dog around roommates but also for lying about her dog being a service dog, it just gives a bad name to everyone who actually has one. It sounds to me like she doesn’t want to get it trained because you (usually) have to have some sort or doctors prescription to get it trained and it *has* to be trained to be a service dog. Does she have an actual need for the service dog?"
bpiczj,NTA - you have no obligation to comfort her. Just carry on.
bpih16,"Dude what the fuck is going on in your school>?

But

NTA

what she did was fucking dumb no shit, and she doesnt have to be an asshole about her friend giving an opinion. but that's not going to get through to her anyway because she obviously doesnt cre about consequences, so dont waste your breath in the future."
bpimnl,NTA.  She sounds very entitled.
bpiobz,"NTA

You're purchasing a ride with everything else on the app. By not doing what you basically paid for, they're the a-holes"
bpirou,"YTA, but it's okay, you had no other choice"
bpit8r,"NAH. I wouldn't fire her though, tell her to focus on her job instead of yours."
bpiv0i,"NTA - your ex is hurt yes but she should respect you as the father of her child. Parents should never trash tall each other in front of their child, that can easily lead to a child developing issues when it comes to then trying to build their own stable family."
bpivvz,"No judgement, please seek therapy. You don’t need to live with this pain."
bpiwod,NAH
bpiybd,Not giving her a bath when she smells would be negligence. You can do it yourself or bring your pet somewhere to have it done. I’d probably bring it to the professional first before you try it. Just so she gets used to it.
bpizaq,"WNTA BUT WBDB (would be the dumbass).  Your landlord could evict you.  Your roommate is not a good puppy owner, and she should have in no way gotten a puppy.  If it’s a purebred, contact the breeder or a breed rescue.  Otherwise, she needs to rehome the puppy.  I hate people like your roommate.  No common sense, or forethought or planning, zero sense of responsibility. And that poor puppy that just wants to be loved gets screwed."

bpj4mr,"NTA, you are legitimately disabled and protecting yourself from further injury, your friend is TA."
bpj52s,"NTA. You're being paid to advertise stuff. Most people paid to advertise stuff don't always use those products. You're fine. Get paid, and when you leave the area no one will care."
bpj7tk,"NTA. You get to choose your friends. Also he's not just pro-life, he's anti-women. Cut him lose."
bpj928,"NTA...  I’m a “boss” and 90 days is bullshit.  It’s his problem if he’s understaffed, not yours... and if he fires you he’ll be even more understaffed.

I hope you addressed it professionally with him at first though because staff dropping last minute changes to availability is a PITA."
bpjixh,"YTA, you said “it’s put away,” so long as it’s not on display in your home there’s no reason he can’t keep an old memento in a box. It’s controlling to try to tell him he can’t keep a photo. If he looks at it often etc and that bothers you that’s an issue with the relationship, not with his possession of the object."
bpjk0b,"NTA. While it probably would have been better to tell her ""If you don't tell your exes, I will"", it sounds like you were basically cleaning up her messes and looking out for your friends.

This stopped being her secret to keep when it affected the health of someone else.

Her being mad at you doesn't make her an asshole (she feels that her confidence has been violated which is understandable), but her not telling her exes to get tested does."
bpjl6m,"NTA - Don't pay anything. Tell her first step is selling her expensive crap and using that cash to pay it off. Once your are 100% sure she has done that, then offer to help. 

You don't help her until she helps herself. She doesn't help herself until she sells some merchandise."
bpjseq,">having very quiet sex to ensure she feels included

&#x200B;

Um...yeah.  So I'll just leave that alone and say...

&#x200B;

NAH.  You guys dealt with the situation by including her as appropriate, but everyone is different.    


You do need to work out an equitable arrangement, though, as it could get somewhat out of hand if you don't."
bpjt31,YTA for doing it to strangers who likely want their farts to go undetected. Family and friends are another story.
bpjwtg,NTA she just wants to keep up with her friends. Gestures are more important than material gifts. If you've already broken up a couple of times this early on just let the relation go
bpjwux,NTA. Fuck the people who think you would be an asshole for telling a guy his life is a lie. This is some information he SHOULD VERY MUCH KNOW. It's on posts like these I hope this is all bullshit.
bpjxi7,"NTA. Her comment clearly made you uncomfortable, you have every right to express that to her and make sure she knows you don't want to be friends with someone who behaves or speaks that way."
bpjxum,NTA. Seems to me like you're in University and an adult. Some parents that University is quite hard and a straight A student in high school is often seen getting some B's and C's. These grades aren't bad. If you passed you passed that's all that matters.
bpjyh7,"NTA.  Her birthday is on Sunday, not Friday night.  This has been planned months ago.  She can be a big girl and go out with her friends for not-her-birthday."
bpjz0a,NAH.  It's a broken arm.  Not like it's life threatening.  She'll get a cast and be out and about I assume.
bpk1pz,YTA. It’s not your business to give her a job application and you’re doing it for passive-aggressive reasons. You don’t know if she’s mentally ill or whatnot.
bpk4ee,NTA.  Find a new job.  That’s grossly illegal.
bpk7ac,"YTA, I get the joke and even laughed a bit.  But given the issue here in the US and how polarized and sensitive it is, I'd advise this; ""just because you can do a thing does not mean you \*should\* do that thing""."
bpk904,Wow I can’t believe the plot to Stranger Things S3 leaked on Reddit.
bpka9g,"NAH. I mean, we all have bad days, and marriage isn't always easy. Just apologize, tell your husband you love him and move on."
bpkaqr,"ESH. This wreaks of immaturity, which makes sense considering you're all high schoolers."
bpkay9,NTA. Although it might be worth it just to rid yourself of him.
bpkbje,"YTA. You are wanting everyone to accommodate YOUR schedule, yet you give no thought to anyone else's. No one had agreed to your schedule, you set it and just expected everyone else to jump on board. Your husband definitely had a right to be annoyed with your selfish behavior."
bpkg48,"NTA, She's not respecting your wishes for your child, so you're perfectly in the right for firing her"
bpkh2b,NTA. There are people in this world who take like 30 minute showers. Your little one inch ass bath is not a problem.
bpklac,"NTA it is your house. However, you should be honest with her about your relationship."
bpkmre,"NTA. I don't think you deserve to be apart of the photo because you pushed through and still did the play. I think you deserved to be in the picture because you were part of the play in general. You put in the time and effort, and deserved to be in the photo."

bpkpe4,NTA - just call the power company and tell them the day you are moving out and you want your name off the account. You owe nothing to the subletter in the least.
bpkqfm,"NTA. It's not even that it was her boyfriend it seems, she didn't treat you like a friend so she doesn't deserve to be your friend. (Good luck on your date :P)"
bpkt6v,"NTA

bpkunu,"YTA - Wait your turn, that's how lines work."
bpkzxs,NTA if you tell her. You'd be TA if you didn't tell her. You're at least somewhat friends with her and she doesn't deserved to be treated the way she is being treated. Though try and get some actual proof or have a little bit more knowledge for be you confirm it with her.
bpl055,"I'm going with NAH.

He wants to be there to share this experience with you. He's not an asshole for that.

It's your body, the baby is coming out of your vagina, and you get final say over how it happens and who is a part of that. You're not an asshole for that.

I don't know that there's a good answer here, though. He may be hurt if you tell him you don't want him in the room."

bpldps,"YTA ... In that he's the Asshole - that person is not being payed enough to get shit on by your husband because he waited 15 minutes instead of 5 to go ask the front of the store what's going on. Speaking to the manager okay fine I guess, but the kid doesn't set the price, doesn't control any staffing choices, and had some random asshat berate him for going on break, and is probably now in trouble with management. 

Does this make your husband feel powerful? I just don't get why people do this"
bplf9h,"NTA.  Call her out.  

Also...

Only loan out money that you never actually expect to see again.  It is nice if it does come back and you act to others like you expect it back, but really never plan on it coming back."
bplgq7,"NAH. Dude, you really should not cut off all your friends. It's really not good mentally and can lead to depression. That being said, have you tried taking with your friends about not drinking? If they really are friends, they will be supportive.

bply41,"NTA, your loyalty to someone shouldn't be questioned because you refuse to make your regular living situation a complete nightmare by disobeying a pretty basic boundary that hasn't ever produced a tangibly negative effect on your life. You're not an asshole for respecting one person's wishes and maintaining the best relationship you can with both people involved."
bpm0oq,"NTA.  The are uncomfortable with an LGBT wedding, you are uncomfortable with homophobia.  Seems like a logical response on your part."
bpm39c,"NTA but it could affect relationships for years, your wife’s relationships.  That makes them shitty but it’s a reality."

bpmeh5,"NTA.

""We miss hanging out with just you. It's a different type of party when he comes."""
bpmem5,ESH. The employee is TA and so are you for going along with it.
bpmf2e,"Yeah YTA - your mother supported her through school and you think you deserve to be more important than someone who actually played a massive part in her life. You don’t have to talk to people, you could just act like a grown up. If you want to be her parent, then be her parent. If a photo or sitting together is too much to ask, then you are immature and a pretty shitty parent 

TBH, if you had pulled that shit with me, you wouldn’t have been invited and I would have kept my grandmother there."
bpmgf4,"NTA

I literally cannot understand her reasoning.  You were a paying customer using customer seating."
bpmijv,Yta. You keep responding to her. How is she going to get the hint when you keep responding? Just block her and be done with it if that’s what you need to do. Or stop responding.
bpmn13,"NTA

That does sound weird and would seem to hint at some sort of deep-seated issue.

You might even want to suggest a counselor when you talk to her."
bpmoqs,"NTA. Your husband is. Your kids are 4 and a half years old - missing a few days of school isn't going to scar them for life. It's more than worth it considering you have a strong relationship with your sister.

It sounds like there might be something deeper going on with your husband that he's so adamant about this..."

bpmtuw,NTA. It isn't really your place to attend a funeral of someone you don't know... And that teacher is awful for trying to force people to attend.

bpmvhp,"...based on the info you've given, NTA.

Probably worth a conversation though. I'm wondering if you did something specific that bothered her without realizing it - the volume was loud enough she could hear porn from the next room (thus her wandering in) and she assumed you were being passive aggressive, something like that. But on the face of it, I'm just confused about her reaction."
bpmvnq,"NAH because I think you’ll just have to prove to him reheated food tastes good. I guess some people aren’t used to it, but you can show him! Like this is just classic meal prepping. It’s efficient, cost effective, and smart. Obviously assure him you’ll make food that reheats well - curry, lasagna, pasta, chili, soups etc. and try to convince him to try it for a week or two. If the food is genuinely good and he’s still not happy, he may well be the asshole."
bpmvr4,"NTA. Explain the situation and how the criteria makes it feel like you’re being singled out. See what he says and if he doesn’t want you to bring your girlfriend, feel free to not go. It’s weird and very bad form on his part."

From her perspective - she went out of her way to give you something that benefitted you, meaning that she went without it, then she had to go out of her way to get it back, even though doing so meant that people would say things to her that she finds hurtful, and even though you could have caused the hurtful things to be avoided by going equally out of your way.

Having step family is very difficult for all involved. When children are born in a family, there is a slow evolution of norms and expectations as the family develops. When a step parent comes in, there is a strong and sudden cultural shift, which can be extremely difficult.

You are not the asshole for being a normal kid in a difficult situation. It sounds like your stepfather has worked to help you as well, and to develop a relationship, and based on the story, is a good person.

My advice: now is the time to be mature and show that you're ready for more. Offer an olive branch. Have a cup of coffee and talk about how you have felt, and how you feel now. Maybe apologize, if you feel that it is needed. Maybe thank him, if you feel that it is deserved.

&#x200B;

As an aside: I truly and utterly despised my stepfather from when my parents got married (I was \~12) until I was in my early 20s. It wasn't all his fault, or all my fault, we butted heads. Since then, we have a very strong relationship and I call him ""dad""."

Girl, you've got to raise your standards. ""Willing to sleep with me"" is a very low bar. You can walk into any space with single men and find men who will sleep with you.

The concept of a two weeks notice in the US is absurd. You're rarely given notice before you're fired from a job, so you should not be obligated to give notice before you quit. The notice is a COURTESY, not a requirement. Looks like they're not extending much courtesy on your end, so why should you? Keep in mind, though, that you probably won't be able to use this job as a reference in the future, because they'll probably tell anyone who calls that you quit without notice and that doesn't look great to future employers. 

You have a migraine (VERY different from a headache, sometimes my migraines are so bad that I can't even see) and your job is expecting you to put them before your own health and comfort. If you don't show up, they'd likely fire you anyway, and your coworkers would have to suffer that loss regardless.

Also your pet insurance might be interested in a full update on what happened. They had to pay out for damages that someone else is responsible for. It's not a huge amount of money so they probably wouldn't go after them, but your pet insurance would totally have the right to sue them for the $314 that they dished out. It's called subrogation."
bpwxd8,"YTA you offered to drive and because they haven’t contacted or asked how your stress levels are or hung out with you constantly over the ONE WEEK you haven’t worked with them and they gave you a magazine you found boring you want to cancel? 

Yes they assumed you would pick them up from their houses which is a reasonable assumption being that you clearly didn’t tell them when you initially offered the lift that you would only pick them up from the bus stop. 

To be clear it’s ok to pick them up from the bus stop but you’re the asshole for not communicating that in the first place."

No you are NTA.  You are quite literally, doing your job.  She is trying to bullshit you and make you feel sorry for her by crying and calling you 'classist'.

bpz7w2,NTA - I was a bit on the fence until you said your girlfriend is bi. That's essentially the same as her making out with a guy if you're going to take her sexuality seriously.
bpz99g,"NTA.  Relationships aren't hostage situations--one person can end them.    


Don't forget that you met the new person while rebounding from the end of a difficult relationship and be careful not to go too fast.  If it's meant to last, it'll work out if you go slowly, too.  I speak from experience here because I have fallen hard on the rebound and it was just that--hard."

bpzlrj,"NTA. Being old doesn't stop someone from being an asshole and it sure as hell doesn't give someone the right to say whatever they want to whomever they want. She had absolutely no right to say what she did. On top of that, you didn't call her names (except maybe in the end, while in the cab, to your bf). You simply told her she was rude."

bq00fq,"YTA:

Sorry, but that was an *extremely* stupid comment on your part. You met this guy once, while your wife has known him for her entire life. The fact that your wife was on edge the whole time is also worth noting.

What you basically said to your wife is ""lol shut up your abuse probably wasn't even that bad"""
bq00yt,"Absolutely NTA

 Can't say the same about your ""friend"" though...

She sounds exhausting and it seems to me like she doesn't really respect you all that much.

If i were you i'd take a good long look at this friendship and its dynamics. 'Cause it sounds a lot like it's skewed towards her advantage."
bq01ot,"NAH - your intentions are good but I feel like maybe you're missing a step. I wonder if you backed up a bit and gave her time to talk about how she feels about it rather than focusing on the action of helping it might feel more supportive? I also wonder if she feels a pressure because you are in the air force and have succeeded, like maybe you will think she's dumb or let you down if she can't do it? I dunno, that would make it harder if it were me 🤷‍♀️ I think if you could give her some space to talk about that with you that she might then feel more able to accept your help or be able to say what she would find helpful? 

Caveat: I have no idea what the task is she has to do or what a duck walk is 😁"

bq1fts,YTA for keeping them up and talking noisily at 2am. But I get that it wasn’t intentional.
bq1lhm,"NTA, holy cow. I am so, so, so, sorry you had to go through all of this. You don't owe anyone anything and definitely not your mother. She sounds like a horrible person and please don't let her succeed in guilt tripping you. Keep her away from you.
I suggest though, because of that massive palette of things happening to you and the nightmares that accure, that you might look into therapy? Moving away is a great thing, but it doesn't necessarily help with the things on your mind. And it would be awful if your new life would still be affected by them.

bq2hbt,"This sucks for everyone but I’m going to say NAH because I don’t think anybody is intentionally trying to hurt the other. 

I think it’s lovely you’ve kept her room as-is but there are other ways you can remember her and honestly, it does seem a bit daft to make your kids share a room when you have a spare room but I get that it hurts like hell. However, it’s a chance to make new happy memories in that space and surely that’s a good thing in the long run? 

Maybe it would be an idea to save some of your daughter’s favourite things etc., make a piece of artwork or scrap book or something cool to display in the house permanently? That way she’s still there and you will always remember her and even if you moved house, you’d be able to take that with you.

Edit: as some people have asked. By DD I meant darling daughter which is a common acronym on any family threads around here. Sorry for any misreading there.

bq2rnn,"NAH. Sounds like she is going through a rough and stressful time. I do think as her friend you first and foremost must be as supportive as possible no matter the situation. I think it’s all about how you bring it up. Maybe frame it as “I’ve been thinking about the things you said about fiancé last week, and they are things I often see in couples that come to me for therapy. Do you guys have a plan to work through these issues?” This will open the door for more conversation without you immediately putting her on the defense. If she continues to express doubt about the marriage support her in leaving him. Gently bring up that spousal behavior rarely changes without significant effort, and overall gently prepare her to think about what she’s getting herself into.

bq38od,"NAH. Her post-partum hormones are going absolutely insane. They’ll shed off of her for a few weeks if not a month. She’s also frustrated bc her mobility is significantly impacted by her recover pain. She can’t help her nagging - she’s miserable and panicked and wants to control what she can. Just help her through this. It’s normal to be frustrated, but you have no clue what she’s going through mentally or physically after childbirth (and a c-section at that)."

As a Chinese person, let me tell you. These dinners annoys me too. But luckily my family likes to go to different restaurants.  For birthdays, you can skip everyone's besides the in laws (her parents, you must attend in laws celebrations), just have your wife bring a small gift (like chocolate or candy) and give them an excuse like you're busy with work (Asians will accept work excuse cause they value work over a lot of things).

&#x200B;

Chinese holidays you can't skip : Chinese new year (the one before for gather the family and the one after for starting the new year).The dinners where you visit the elders after new years. The winter solstice (its like thanksgiving). Anyone's 50,60,70,80,90 birthday. Her grandparents, parents birthdays.

Other than these, you can skip pretty much everything with work excuse, I would go to at least one a month tho.  Have your wife always bring a gift when you are missing, candy, chocolate, wine, always works."

I’d give her a pass on the dress if everyone was wearing the same dress but given that that doesn’t sound like it’s the case, she can’t dictate how much you spend (although she can veto a specific dress) 



All that being said, think it through. There are consequences to pulling out of a wedding, socially speaking.   People are going to talk, make assumptions, maybe even take sides.

But think this through... If you refuse to carpool, when you are both coming from and going to the same place at the same time, it will cause a lot of anger and resentment.  Once your coworkers learn of this, they will not understand your feelings and your reputation will suffer anyway.

I said if they’re worried ( as in, if they’ve been given reason to believe) their friends and partner are the type to use people for their money, I have no idea why OP would want to maintain those relationships. I personally couldn’t date someone who felt like they couldn’t be honest about their financial situation with me.

Or course she wants to come along considering her child is an infant. And those are her child's grand parents whhom I'm sure she still wants to maintain a decent relationship with. Dating somebody with a kid means you have to be more open and comfortable with scenarios that pop up like this.

But you're not an ass hole for feeling uncomfortable. It's only nautral especially given the context."

bqbgw5,"NTA - My dude... You spent a lot of time talking about this guy, but your girl sounds like a complete fucking asshole, man.  Seriously.

It sounds like your girl sucks and needs a swift kick to the curb for not understanding basic, common decency."

bqbkfj,"NTA. People can be passionate about whatever they want, but they can’t force that passion on anyone else."
bqbkye,"YTA.

You reconnected *only two weeks ago*. This is a huge gift, and you really mean well, but your relationship just isn't at that point, either as friends or as couple. 

By all means, get her something small from your trip, to show her you care, as you do. Give it to her yourself. And if you want to date her, ask her out! *Then* you can buy her expensive gifts.

Buying people expensive gifts when you barely know them is not necessarily creepy, but it *is* a bit too much. It unbalances the relationship at the point where you're just getting to know each other. She's going to wonder what you mean by it, she's going to feel awkward like you're trying to bribe her, she's going to wonder why you put her in that position--and all of those things are not going to be good for the friendship. 

So cool it. You can cheer her up without the headphones. You want to do something with that money you hate, donate to charity."
bqbmh7,NTA. She’s a racist asshole and you responded appropriately. I appreciate your sass.
bqbq5a,"YTA - I've been a tabletop gamer for years, which might skew my opinion.  #1 sounds like an excuse.  So what?  As a DM, you CAN and SHOULD adapt.  #2 this is 100% your fault.

If so, you are COMPLETELY the asshole.  If not, did you CLEARLY convey your requirements for complete, descriptive backstorys?  

There's nothing wrong with pushing a game, but stop blaming them.  At least own it and be like ""Sorry guys, I have not had the time to get the game together to make sure we all have a great time"".  That's way better than what, from the limited info I have, sounds like you've dropped the ball and want to blame them for.

All shit aside, I hope you guys have an awesome game!  If you're looking for another player, let me know!  :)"

bqbv14,NTA. The behavior reflects their character and I don’t want a friend with that kind of character.
bqbxat,NTA but you may find yourself unemployed. I’d work the one and then no more.

bqbz3m,"YTA unless you're personally able to offer her a better income that's a job she doesn't mind doing. 

Some jobs involve a bit of acting. All customer service jobs do. 

Put it this way, if she were a Hollywood star would you be on her case not to take romantic roles? 

As a bartender, she can brush off people hitting on her in a friendly smiling way and make tips for it. If she was a cashier, she'd have to do the same thing but she'd get paid less and treated miserably. 

No one gets to speak their mind all the time on their job except Elon Musk."
bqbzfl,[deleted]
bqc2hb,"That is your issue to deal with, not hers."
bqc64o,"NTA.  IMO tips are based on service, and it sounds like their service sucked. Also, they already charged you extra. You spent way more than what you would have for just the two hours + a tip. You don't owe them. Lastly, your friend chose to give them a tip. Whether she thought they deserved a tip or not, it was her choice. Her expecting you to pay her back would be the equivalent of you buying someone a gift and demanding to be repaid."
bqc6h1,"NTA. You did give them a heads up. Next time, call instead of text. Also I do think that you made the right call to stay in your boyfriend’s house. It’s dangerous to drive when you are too tired."
bqc73k,"NAH. It’s their house and they are paying for it, therefore they get to decide how much work they want to put in to maintain it. You have every right to want to live in a cleaner house, but since it’s their house that they’re letting you live in for free, if you want it to be cleaner, that’s on you."
bqcauj,NTA. It was ridiculous of her to ask a question like that on a first date.
bqcddc,"NTA - your mom sounds like the type of person that needs policing. She was actively making other people's time worse.

That being said you should not be the one policing her, for your own sake. I actually think it's very good of you to keep her in line, and is the opposite of being an asshole. But you should enjoy your life and not have to ""mother"" your own mom. If I were you I would make dad do it."
bqcden,YTA. If the photographs were that important to y'all you should've told her to gtfo of the shot.
bqcg5d,"ESH.  


She was out of line.  However,  


""...that would have upset me and the situation could have turned ugly.""  You're an adult.  We can't control what emotions we feel, but we do get to choose how to react to those emotions.  Don't act like it's some external force that would make the situation turn ugly.  It would be your choice of how to react to her being an asshole."
bqchsz,"NAH - Sometimes you have to confront behavior like this to know exactly who your friends are. As long as it was done respectfully, you are fine. On the same token, there is nothing saying that they have to have you along for everything, especially if they were going to be doing something they know you may have been uncomfortable with, and were keeping low key so as not to hurt your feelings. Hard to tell, but this kind of stuff happens in any circle of friends."
bqci8h,"ESH. Teens are gonna teen, but if there's a pedestrian in the road, drivers must yield the right of way.

bqcroy,"NAH I suggest that you sit down and talk to them about your feelings. It doesn't sound like this is a malicious choice on their part, especially if you live a culture that speaks their first language predominantly. However, it's absolutely a valid concern and worth starting a conversation about. If they can't understand why you are bothered by it or they aren't willing to meet you halfway, then I would question if there's a malicious intention behind it."
bqcsyy,NAH - Ya boy has a porn addiction
bqct5z,"NTA. This is an unpopular opinion, but the use of spotters by a towing company is illegal. That the owner of these lots is using a tow company that is operating illegally is wrong.

bqdofw,"YTA - Sam is probably insecure about her looks anyways, and the last person she wanted to reinforce that negativity was her own mother. You go to your mom when you want to hear little white lies to build your self esteem. hence the phrase, “you’re my mom, you have to say that.”"
bqdqao,"YTA. You can present your case, but petitioning and repeatedly asking teachers to change their curriculum to fit students’ liking is massively inappropriate. You’re there to learn, not teach teachers how to teach.

Newsflash, teenagers don’t like doing uncomfortable or difficult tasks in school. What’s next, homework? Tests? Public presentations foster important skills that you really can’t live without in adulthood. Teachers would be doing you all a disservice by forgoing presentations because a few teens find them awkward.

Ironically, for a campaign to be successful you 100% need to have good public speakers/presenters. So what you are all doing right now is literally another exercise in public presentation lmao."

It was wrong of him to take his pain out on you but you seem to understand where it comes from and you have similar pains to deal with.

bqdu2z,"NTA, he wasn't paying you and lied about when you'd get your money. You would have turned up to work for free for another week."
bqe1m6,"NTA.  I was homeless beginning the week after I graduated high school.  Was scared and hungry.  Had a group of drunk guys offer me takeout food late one night, and before I could take a bite one dude said ""you know he jacked off in that right?"" They all laughed like it was the funniest shit theyd ever heard when I dropped it and got the hell out of there.

After that, no matter how hungry I was I wouldn't take food that I hadn't watched while it was bought, and that wasn't sealed in wrappers still.  Because no matter how hungry I was, I couldn't trust what people gave. 

The homeless person could have just wanted cash for drugs, or he could have had an experience like mine.  But the fact is you tried to do a good thing.  That's a reason to be proud of who you are.  Don't let one potentially negative experience change that.

Edited from NAH to NTA based on OP's further description of what he tried to give."

bqf981,"YTA

You got a kid now. Being timid and shy with your parents is a poor excuse. Put your big girl panties on and be firm with your folks. It's great that you have a good relationship with your folks, but that kid and your wife are your family. You're responsibility. Don't hand me that ""it's my culture"" bullshit either, that's just an excuse. If they grt mad so be it, but running from your problem will only make it worse.

bqfe4p,"NAH - You have a reasonable excuse to pull out IMO and you are giving him a reasonable amount of notice if the wedding is in October.  Hopefully, he'll understand."
bqfi60,"Because your girlfriend sounds like a responsible adult who is trying to work her way through school and build a life for herself, and she won't be able to do that with your sister, and her two kids, crammed into a tiny apartment, when she is trying to study and relax and live.  And your sister, is a grown ass woman, ten years older than her and has apparently screwed up her life and finances so badly that she's trying to sponge off her decades younger little brother and your girlfriend is trying to build a life so that SHE herself doesn't end up homeless on the streets and instead of recognizing that, you're attempting to torpedo her efforts.   

That's why."

bqgbic,"NTA. They are your tickets for the people YOU are close with. Time to shake off the chains of your parents, set appropriate barriers, and enforce them.

Remind your mom that these are your tickets, that you've grown away from your aunt, that these two people are very important to you, and tell her to drop the subject. You can remind her if she brings it up again.

It would also be a very nice gesture to reach out to your aunt and express your sympathies that she didn't make the cut (with nicer caring words of course). Unless you aunt isn't aware.or expressing any concern herself. Perhaps this is all your mom..."
bqgizd,"NTA - It makes me so sad that you even doubt this. 

In no way are you obligated to keep working for someone who crossed your lines and made you uncomfortable by instigating something sexual, no one would expect that of you if it was a regular client. 

The fact that it’s a family member only makes your consideration of quitting even more understandable, as such a situation should never occur between family. Your grandfather turned a normal and platonic gesture into something it shouldn’t be, and that’s not ok.

The slight guilt I sense you feel by your mention of his lack of physical capabilities is misplaced. Your grandfather might be old and unable to clean his house himself, but that doesn’t change the fact that his weird and bizarre action has made you uncomfortable. He can hire someone else if he needs to, it’s not your obligation and wasn’t to begin with.

I’m sorry you had to experience this and hope you’re okay."
bqgizl,"NTA - he brought his iPad to a party. Someone, who is not you, damaged his iPad. Now he is demanding that you pay for it? He’s lost his mind. If he wants the people who spilled to pay for it, he can find them himself, that is not your problem."
bqgps4,"Gonna go against the grain here and say YTA. In my opinion, your wife is fully aware of her health conditions and as you said has pretty good will power controlling it most of the time. If once a month she wants to eat a slice of cake, fully aware of the consequences, and you take it away from her because it ‘interferes with plans for sex’ then yeah, YTA. You wouldn’t be if you gently reminded her she will feel like trash, but by physically removing food from her that’s controlling and weird.

Let her have a slice of cake when she wants to. If it were all the time Id consider a serious conversation but if it’s only once in a while, you’re just being controlling."
bqgts3,"YTA, but for the right reasons. You’re worried about the impact that this could have on you and your family, and that’s absolutely reasonable. However, if your siblings have expressed interest in finding your father then it’s not up to you to hide him from them. You don’t get to make a unilateral decision for everybody, you only get to decide for yourself. 

Give them the nitty gritty and make it clear that YOU do not want him anywhere near you or involved in your life in any way. Let them decide for themselves how they wish to proceed. They have a right to decide what they want to do with the information you found."

I think you wife may be assuming this is selective hearing rather than actual hearing loss (have you had a dr verify the hearing loss?) because it does seem selective if you can hear others but not her...but it is possible that her voice just hits in a range that is difficult for you to hear."

You can vent about the emotional toll it takes to care for someone with PTSD without literally saying you ignore them and that you don't know how others can handle it. That's incredibly rude.

bqj2bf,NAH oof this is a tricky situation but they’re both adults and your mom doesn’t work directly for the firm. This could potentially be a conflict of interest but I’m not really sure? You and your mom might also feel better if it’s out in the open.
bqj57e,"NTA. He didn't really care about what you'd want to do. I assume he didn't even care that you didn't enjoy it, so it would've been a waste of time to pretend anyways."
bqj5y9,NTA  Maybe it's time she learned about repercussions.
bqj7j2,"YTA. You may know more about baseball, and that's great. Use your knowledge and skills to teach him better. But your daughter should be just as important and it's not about you or your wife. It's about HER. If you don't know her best race time, which is literally like the most basic question if you attend any competition, then it shows that you don't care about her sport as much. I'm also sure your wife wouldn't have noticed if you actually put more thought into it. It's entirely possible that your daughter brought it up to your wife, and was too nervous to come to you directly with it. That's just an assumption but you should consider it possible. 

Your wife quizzing you makes me a little uncomfortable, but I can see a quiz coming up during an argument / casual conversation where it's like ""Oh yeah? Can you even name her best time?"" In which case she's just proving a point to show that you really haven't been paying as much attention as you say you have."
bqj8es,"You're never the asshole for not wanting to date someone, but he's clearly just nervous. Just ask him to tone it down.

Obviously, you're not obligated to teach him anything, but if he doesn't have experience, and you want to turn him down for inexperience, how's he going to get any experience? If you're just aiming for a fling, sure, maybe not worth your time, but if you're looking for love, experience will come as he has experiences.

NAH, but I think you should give the date a shot."
bqj8jl,NTA. College graduation ceremonies take freaking forever and are so boring. They trudge up every speaker they possibly can to drag the damn thing out. It also sounds like they want some free photography out if it. Big NTA.
bqj9az,">So me and my girlfriend have been dating for 1 year, and we are definitely going to get married. 

Narrator: They didn't"
bqjloy,YTA. Wait till you get older and realize high school popularity doesn't mean anything.
bqjnf7,NTA. He broke into a locked section of your backpack and stole money. If he didn’t want a criminal record he shouldn’t have stolen.
bqjnor,"NTA: That dog is a ticking time bomb and she needs to train it. There is a difference between a dog pulling at its leash and barking and lunging and trying to kill something. If that dog gets off its leash it is very possible it will kill something. Then friend is liable, dog will be labeled a vicious dog and it will be destroyed."
bqjnx1,"im gonna say NTA, people have lives, school, doctors, ect things that need to be figured out ahead of time. its bs they try to change it like that on you. i would 100% not go in"
bqjonp,"That is such a low effort task and if I were asked to do it I would feel bad to charge an old lady for it. While I sympathize with you for wanting compensation for work, this is a small favor and they supplied all the materials you'd need.

&#x200B;

Slight YTA"
bqjos7,"NTA. She doesn't ""allow"" you time, you're entitled to it. Why does she want to change though - her schedule?

It doesn't sound like you're communicating very effectively so a court order is probably a good idea."
bqjpx5,"NTA- but, one suggestion is if you do have bad ibs, or even a borderline possibility of chrones or colitis, check out some of the hunting undergarments that are made with built in charcoal filters. 

The charcoal filtering is made to dimish/reduce / eliminate odors significantly if not entirely. 

This may help you a lot.  

I'm sorry that your friends treated you this way. 

You had to have felt uncomfortable enough on your own, without being chastised by them. 

I hope this helps you."
bqjqsw,"YTA, it sounds like he's had this cat in his care longer than you've had at this point. I'm hearing that you had the cat for 1 year, then he had the cat for 8 months + a few months in between + another 9 months + another 4 months from now? So this guy has been taking care of this cat for over 2 years, then you flat out admit that you have no idea if you'll be able to care for the cat again in another 3 years? You are NOT in a place to take care of this animal, pets are for life, not for when it's convenient. Your ex should keep the cat."
bqjr51,"NTA.  It's up to you if she's earned that second chance, but you aren't an asshole if you cut ties.  Seems like you don't want to be an emotional punching bag the way she becomes harsh to you."
bqjvd7,NTA - she can't expect neighbours not to party when she does the same thing
bqjvng,"Nope - definitely not the asshole. You didn't tell your friend to risk it all on a get-rich-quick scheme. It'd be nice if you bought one piece of jewelry (maybe to regift) for $10, but if you have no desire to buy it, then you are in no position to buy it (and you're not an asshole if you don't do it). 

&#x200B;

Maybe you can help in a non-monetary way. You said she has some spelling errors on her ads or whatnot - maybe you can offer (if you feel comfortable) to revise her advertisements before she posts? But you'd still not be an asshole if you didn't do this - again, this is just if you felt like being nice / wanted to support a friend in a non-monetary type of way."
bqjw37,"NTA. You was being respectful since you’re in a relationship. 

Waving someone off classified as sexist now..that’s a yikes"
bqjz9p,"NTA- you did them a favour by selling their tickets to get their money back. That postage cost should absolutely not come out of your pocket. If they physically possessed the tickets and tried to sell them (instead of having you do it), they would obviously also have to also pay the postage. Would it be reasonable if they then sent you an invoice to cover the postage cost? Absolutely not! Make sure you deduct the money."
bqk44e,"NTA because you are an adult. Maybe you need to get your mom’s name off your account so she can’t check it. Even if you feel like you have to live at home for whatever reason, it’s good to work and learn how to manage your own finances sooner rather than later."
bqk785,"NTA you’re doing their loved ones a favor. If you didn’t, maintenance probably would eventually"
bqkh5a,"YTA. 


Not for your beliefs, but because you call a perfectly normal activity a waste of time, to the people who are inviting you to it!


It's just rude. You could have simply declined the invitation. 


And they are right BTW. Work life balance is a thing, and you might end up rich, but.... Why. If you've got no one around you."
bqki9u,"I’m working on my own communication as I do have major, major issues. It’s very difficult to repair the relationship while she’s in treatment as we’d just piss each other off more. 
I know I could have a better relationship with her"
bqkmay,"YTA. You have no reason to go other than she didn’t attend yours, even though you admit she was suffering from mental health issues. That makes you an asshole. You should support your sister."
bqkv80,"NTA. It’s your wedding, you are paying for it and it’s better to apply the rule to everyone instead of make exceptions. That way you avoid hard feelings from people who were told they weren’t allowed to bring their kid."
bqkxst,"NTA she obviously doesn’t know what she’s talking about, is being unreasonable and unapologetic. I’d unfriend your aunt so this doesn’t repeat."
bqkxu0,NTA you’re just in a bad living situation and it’s getting to you. GTFO with your friend and leave this situation behind.
bql1q0,"NTA - she's not upset that you didn't ask for permission first or the answer would be different.

>me sending her cash is not the same. We are now in a fight and I'm being told I need to get cash from an ATM to replace it

...did you not just tell her that you would be giving her cash to replace it? What is she pitching a fit over? If you replace the money how is it not the same? How old is this person?..."
bql7nb,"NAH.  But you should do the other interview anyway, because the other job isn’t a sure thing yet,"
bql833,NAH.  The dog needs a home and an owner that loves him.
bql9vf,"NTA.

Your parents are ridiculous. You can ask anyone that has gone to a University. They have always wished to go to community college to save money and not be in so much debt as they are now. This is your future not their's."
bqlagp,"NTA she was being out of line yelling at you, accusing you of stealing etc. and then she boarded with the wrong group. I say it's a fine example of karma coming for someone & you had no responsibility to remind her since SHE was the one who forgot to unplug her phone."
bqllop,"YTA. You RSVPd. They probably already spent money on you. And you aren’t even a Padres fan.

You should maintain a better calendar if it took you that long to realize you were double booked"
bqlm2s,"NAH, you aren’t an asshole. You just screwed up. It happens. It sucks your crab died. I’m sorry for your loss."
bqlp7d,"YTA. Funny how you're trying to save up to fight how much you pay to support your children rather than fight to get court appointed visitation rights. These are your children, dude! Not having a relationship with them and even trying to get one makes you TA"
bqlrae,"NTA. He’s a dumbass and a dick. If it was that important to him he should have had a conversation about it with you, about actually watching it not the “checking in on it” nonsense"
bqlxsq,"NTA. If you aren’t comfortable going, don’t go. You wouldn’t enjoy yourself and may make it difficult for others to enjoy themselves."
bqlyxo,Why do you have location sharing with her sister and she doesn't?
bqm11b,NTA. He left and said he had homework. Were the rest of you supposed to avoid all fun activities until he could rejoin the group?
bqm38w,"NTA you should always be paid for work, family is no exception."
bqm684,NTA. I’m now worried about how the rest of your pregnancy will go with a lot physical changes that might inhibit you from doing your chores. I’ve been pregnant twice and I mostly just wanted to sleep. Is this show of temper a normal occurrence?
bqm71x,"NAH. Dementia is a curse, I’m sorry you have to go through this."

bqmeco,"If you have proof that she was cheated out of this medal, I think you should report that."
bqmfl8,"NTA

You had a job to do. You were already aware about the new guy, and were (probably) going to greet him when you were done with your job. Even if you don't greet him, it's not that big of a deal. His day won't be ruined because one person didn't greet him. And the way Sue talked to you...jeez. No one should ever be talked to like that. Why is it her business whether you make any friends in the workplace or not? You should get to live your life how you want, she doesn't get the right to boss you around, regardless if you have autism or not. She's being overly dramatic and controlling. And since you do have autism, you have the right to socialize how you please. That applies to everyone, with or without autism. So yeah, no worries my guy, she's an asshole and you're in the right. Sorry this had to happen to you."
bqmgqp,"NTA. The way he's acting is not how any good friend would ever act. You've spoken to him about it and he still won't change his behavior. I'd say you wouldn't be cutting him out of your life for your girlfriend, you'd be doing it for you..."
bqmhmn,"NTA. Sounds like you could name your price for cooking for him. But do you need/want the extra income? If not, maybe let him in on the freezer meal section of the grocery store (Healthy Choice is a great option)."
bqmjch,It’s always a dick move to throw away someone else’s stuff. This feels more like a conversation type thing. YWBTA
bqmnt7,YTA. Why is a drunk asshole more important than someone else’s safety and well-being? Why is the drunk assholes fun night more important than the other persons? Why is an adult who willingly got drunk incapable of taking care of himself should he be “kicked out”?
bqmq5b,ESH - Her response is very non sympathetic and not helpful. But you acted like a dick.
bqms0v,"ESH - are you all 13 years old?  No?  Then grow up and act like adults and more importantly - parents.  This is some very petty stuff you all blew into a huge, big deal."
bqmsbp,"YTA. But not because you helped the old man out. But because of the validation, you seek through this post for the deed."
bqmvye,NTA and time to move. You clearly have different goals in life and unlikely they are 'going to see it your way'
bqmxm0,"As someone who loves gardening, this would infuriate me. But I would try to be easy on him. A lot of non-gardeners don’t understand that a healthy garden doesn’t necessarily look picture perfect, full of only immaculate ornamentals and brand-new, store-bought fencing, trellises, and beds. They tend to think that everything should be right and tight like a suburban lawn. My guess is that he was trying to “clean up” for you and for that reason, I’d let this go, but give him firm instructions to stay out of the garden from now on. And maybe buy you some native flowers to make up for the ones he destroyed. I bet your native pollinators really liked those!"
bqmzy0,"NTA-She needs help if she can't see how abusive and manipulative he is being to her. Tell her and gently explain all of the problems and how a relationship should be. If she still doesn't see reason get her parents involved or drop her. A real friend would heed your advice and take your feelings into account. She gets mad becuase you don't want to her about her ""amazing, loveable, perfect boyfriend,"" then that i a signal that she doesn't respect you or your feelings."
bqn20k,"NTA, but honestly, it may be kinder to keep this to yourself."
bqn2t9,">his doesn’t mean they have to accommodate your schedule to the minute

And he doesn't have to accommodate theirs either.. Telling them ""Nevermind, our timing doesn't work I'll find another way"" Does not make you an asshole in any way shape or form."
bqna2f,"NTA.

If came into your property because they didn't secure their fence to prevent their dog from going into your yard. It's unfortunate, but I believe you have no obligation to pay.

On the other hand, chipping in even a bit might prevent future problems with said neighbor, but do what you feel is right."
bqnaf2,NTA. I mean. What? Might be some other issues if that’s really all it took to start an argument 😅
bqnbyl,YTA. They're both your exes. It's absolutely none of your business what they do.
bqnep8,"NTA (added after edits)

INFO:

Are you saying that you don't want to go to his house, or that you don't want to be friends with him at all?"
bqnh4r,"ESH, but good for you!"
bqnhj2,"Man, shit... I guess I’m gonna play armchair psychiatrist here for a second, but here’s the thing: as much as you tried to stay in touch with her, you also left when she was a very small child. You moved to an entirely different country, and presumably didn’t see much of her. Like, please feel free to correct me if I’m wrong, but it sounds like you mostly just had contact via the phone. Now here she is, years later, telling you something important about herself, inviting you to be one of the people that know this thing about her, and... you kind of just glazed over it. I’m not saying all queer people want everyone they tell to immediately break out the streamers and confetti, but it’s always nice to feel supported by the people in your life. And that’s probably what your daughter was looking for. She wanted to hear that you still love her and support her and instead you basically went “oh that’s neat, anyway you catch the big game?” As if she’d just told you she got a minor promotion at work. Add that to the fact that it sounds like there’s a lot of natural strain baked into your relationship, I’m not entirely shocked she didn’t react well. I don’t know what your relationship with her mother was like, I don’t know what you’ve been doing that’s kept you apart from your daughter, I’m not going to judge you on any of that. But you have to understand that when it comes to big moments like this, you have to pull through harder than a dad that stuck around would. YTA, even if you’re a well-intentioned one."
bqnl9d,"NTA. You have every right to cut someone out of your life if they are toxic and your father clearly is.

You do not have to engage with your family on this subject. You can ask not to discuss it and leave it at that.

Hold firm on your boundaries on this one. You are wise to refuse to engage."
bqnlvr,NTA. And I have bad news. Your wife is a snob.
bqnmbc,"NAH, but it sounds like your parents can't afford it. I live in an expensive area with lots of rich people, but I  am not rich. We're not catholic, so that saves a lot of money, but I practically pray she won't want a sweet sixteen, because I won't be able to do that for her."
bqnr3h,YTA he told you he was trying to get that job and you tried to take it from him. What kind of friend does that?
bqns2o,"I'm gonna go with YTA don't put him in the middle. Go to counseling or better yet, just talk to your husband about it."
bqnx1m,"YTA

Get over yourself people are allowed to celebrate their wins. Try being happy for your friends instead of only thinking of yourself."
bqo547,"YTA. 

I am very intrigued by your words “my girlfriend had some good points” about the nature of your interactions with this other girl. What were these other points? Do you think you played any part in creating the situation that made her feel hurt and jealous? 

The point here is that your girlfriend’s suspicions, according to YOU, are not all that unreasonable.  She’s not paranoid, she’s not irrationally clingy — she saw and heard things herself that made her feel jealous, and then had the correct nature of her jealous feelings confirmed by again, by YOU, when you admitted she had some good points. 

YOU set up this situation, kiddo, and it sucks for your girlfriend. 

Why are you blaming her for having a meltdown? Who wouldn’t have lingering suspicions, when their previous suspicions turned out to be, uh, correct?"

bqob8d,NAH you are not required to remain in any relationship you don’t want to
bqocrp,"NTA- It seems like even after repeated incidents she doesn't really support you in a way a real friend would have. This sort of thinking can lead to a toxic relationship, I believe it's better for you to try to cut this relationship and be done with it."
bqog41,"NTA.

It sounds like this has gone on for a while, so it sounds like by not actively objecting, they've sort of assumed that their 'tradition' of using your place as the default destination for events is OK.

Firstly, if your BF is insistent on having these friends over, I would sit him down and make it crystal clear to him that if HE wants them over, it's his responsibility to do the cleaning up. If he can't agree to that, then you only invite them over when you want."
bqogr2,NTA.  your parents sound more like a child than you.  they need to actually... talk... and get their shit together.
bqojfa,"YTA.  You could have had a single coffee date and then bailed.  Instead, you choose the meanest and most cowardly route."
bqok6x,YTA. I hope she brings you to small claims court for vandalism.
bqok8z,"This is really more of an advice post but oh well, If you think telling her would mean putting her in a great deal of trouble later on, then don't, obviously. But if you feel guilty and want to get it off your chest, talk to your dad about it. If your dad is just leaving shit like that open on his computer, it seems like he's not too careful about it and he probably doesn't think too much of it. I'd tall to him if I were you. Don't know how old you are but maybe do it over dinner or over a drink instead of at home."
bqokm7,"NTA. You father is putting his grandchildren in danger by having her anywhere near them. Regardless of their age, there still kids who can be easily endangered. Your dad is an extreme enabler."
bqom0r,"NAH

You're a girl. You didn't lie. Not being completely transitioned doesn't make you any less of a girl or woman. Unless your biological sex is relevant for some reason it's nobody's business but your own."
bqotl7,"NTA, she shouldnt have responded period. Past is in the past, it stays there."
bqotms,"NTA, good on you for celebrating the achievement with people who supported you through it."
bqotmx,"YTA bro your grandfather is dying, he wants to permanently change his body to honor him, and he wants the ability for him to see it before he dies, and you have the audacity to call it weird to him because you have some preconceived notion of what a date tattoo should be?

also i want to get my parents birthday on me, ive never seen it as a ""memorial"" tattoo. do parents who have their kids birthdates on them only have dead kids?"
bqoujl,"NTA the wife is way insecure. As long as you're honest you'll have nothing to hide, but if you want to make this relationship work you'll get to the bottom of her insecurity."
bqov75,Soft YTA. If you do it the same weekend your little sister will 100% get overshadowed. I've been in a similar position-- my brother brought his gf home for everyone to meet at graduation-- and it really sucked because everyone paid attention to them and I felt like an afterthought. I know that HS graduations don't feel like a big deal once you're out of school but it's a really big deal to her now. The kind thing to do is space it out.
bqowbp,NTA. Baby's health is more important than their feelings
bqoxdt,"NTA I’m guessing he sees his in laws way more often than he ever received oral so he’s doing something he hates a lot more than she was 🤷🏼‍♀️

Edit: HOLY SHIT platinum and silver???? Thanks y’all! 

For clarification tho, I’m not comparing giving head to going to supper. I’m just saying he’s sacrificing his time and comfort to do something he hates on a WEEKLY basis. That’s a lot of time doing stuff you really don’t wanna do."
bqp5tw,"Soft YTA because of the intentions of telling him. And honestly i don’t think you should pursue any relationship with her. If she’ll cheat with you, she’ll cheat on you."
bqpaal,"ESH so first off, I should say I'm a kid and might be a bit biased. I used to play videogames all day but not because I was ADDICTED, I just didn't see anything else more stimulating to take up my time. I didn't have anything to DO outside as I didn't have any friends in the neighborhood. Limiting games is fine and dandy but will mostly lead to him just lounging around the house I'd imagine, while possibly building resentment. Personally I'd recommend game time DAILY, and maybe a new physical activity. For instance, my parents had us try a Ju Jitsu class and I found it stimulating, interesting, and very physically involved. 

In short, your plan will probably work in the long run. But giving him a bit more time on his games and getting him interested in a physical activity with PURPOSE could grow your Bond and improve his attitude. Best of luck!"
bqpcuo,"What are your goals for teaching? What are the goals of the parent? Does the girl enjoy the lessons, or are the parents unhappy with the lack of progress also?

If you want to quit because you are frustrated, go ahead. You won’t always have success stories but I think you have to consider what is a success story. You are disappointed because this child isn’t a musical savant; weren’t you sort of setting yourself up to not have the situation meet your expectations? 

My first step would be to reach out to any other music teachers you know. If you can recommend someone to this mother, it would go a long way in helping both her and the student. And there’s no shame in admitting that you need a “second opinion” so to speak from a different teacher."
bqpczd,"ESH. Your friends are pretty shitty for calling you a failure for not going to college and saying that they hoped you’d OD, but you’re not making a great case for yourself either. You sound pretty spiteful and confrontational too. While I don’t think that calling you a failure for your career choices is fair, I think that they are rightfully concerned with your use of acid. That shit can be dangerous."
bqph7t,"NTA, she’s not a kid and you aren’t her parent (I hope not at least). What happens to her isn’t your problem, do whatever you want."
bqpi9n,"NAH would be my response. OP is freaking out because scary and because OP is dramatic and I think bf was trying to reassure. Doing it poorly, but still."
bqpkch,NAH just say no. You can't. List the reasons. Say what you can do for him (if anything) to help your mom. And then ask your mom.
bqpkk6,NTA - This is a legitimate safety concern and it sounds like you handled it very well.
bqpo84,"NTA. If anything it makes a 50¢ difference to go from cheese to pepperoni. I'm vegetarian so I always have to pick off meat toppings and nobody complains. I see at the end you said ""The person who ordered dinner."" But I feel like you meant to say more about that lol"
bqprjs,"NTA. Regardless of whether or not it’s a big fire hazard, there’s always a possibility and you guys should take every precaution possible to prevent a fire from happening. He’s being extremely careless and you’re just voicing out your concerns."
bqprm7,"YTA, not for the honest mistake, but for bolting right after. Dude cmon."
bqpzqa,"NTA, you didn’t refund her you each paid her share. There is a big difference between a choice and hospital."
bqpzry,NTA - they fucked around and smoked pot knowing you wanted to make your concert.
bqq0f5,"NTA but why the fuck would your boyfriend invite you to someone's stag party without clearing it with everyone first? It's almost always a guys day, he had no business doing that. It's not fair to you and unless the groom knew it wasn't fair to the groom. Once you discovered it was a stag and no one knew you'd be there, you should have left.

Honestly, your boyfriend sounds like an asshole. My girlfriend is extremely social too, knows a lot of people and any time I go with her to functions or social events she always makes me feel included the whole time and ensures I'm not left to float in a sea of people I barely know. Your boyfriend seems very ambivalent about your overall comfort level in those situations. It's also telling he just took it upon himself to invite you to someone else's stag party like it was his own."
bqq0t1,YTA. That’s just straight up rude. Like come on. Why would you say that? What good came out of that comment for you?
bqq79u,ESH. She's being inconsiderate. You need to grow a spine. Passive aggressive comments about her promiscuity isn't going to keep your family safe.
bqq8ba,"NTA, based on her multiple tattoos and subsequent cover-ups she is not good at picking tattoo designs and should really listen to your opinion more."
bqqey6,"NTA. Perhaps she felt obligated to watch her neice but regardless, it's weird to assume that anyone else wants to hang out with a kid they don't know."
bqqi9c,"NAH. It’s understandable that your sister would have issues after an accident where she got injured, but the accident was in no way your fault. Sounds like your sister might benefit from some therapy to work through her fears if they’re really affecting her life this much.

Edit: I forgot that NAH existed and that fits what I’m saying much better than NTA"
bqqk5m,"NTA, Big red flag, man. I get not enjoying PDA, but if you have a standard, HAVE A STANDARD. Especially if some rando can rub on her but you get the 'no touchy' and aren't allowd to be upset about it? No thanks"
bqqmmc,"I mean... they call you in; what do you say? If you say, ""Sorry, I have other obligations"" then obviously NTA."
bqqoxa,YTA mate. It’s not like ISIS goes around making t-shirts.
bqqr1u,"NTA- sounds like a bully to me. I have a friend that does this, I almost never hang out with him anymore."
bqqv0v,NTA he's honestly probably just flexing cuz his kids are acting up and he's not really around to fix the issue since he works nights. The wife probably got on his case about it and/or the fact this was going on with the boy hit a nerve. As a dad who worked third shift on and off over the years it's a pretty touchy subject when it is implied (or taken that way) that you aren't doing your job raising your kids right.
bqqy3e,"NTA. Tell him an Uber cleaning fee is a hell of a lot cheaper than a DUI, and that he's an idiot."
bqr5dz,[removed]
bqr6o0,"NAH doesn't sound like he's being a jerk on purpose and neither are you, I mean you already have a lot to do its hard to clean up after someone everyday, why not see if he can help with a big chore around the house to make him feel useful and get that off your shoulders."
bqrbdw,"YTA for using information he shared with you in confidence as a weapon.  His big transgression was being arrogant?  That’s a classic sign of someone who is deeply insecure.  You could have handled it many different ways, but instead chose an action that hurt him deeply - and destroyed his social life - and can’t be taken back."
bqrc64,"NTA - You two agreed you could have the cat. She sounds incredibly selfish or at least her boyfriend does.

Edit: HES not paying rent right? YOU are and you’re paying for the cat."
bqrfoq,"NAH

I think you should tell your girlfriend once you've got the replacement. Tell her it means a lot to you, too, and that's why you replaced it so quickly."
bqrjx6,NTA. I would be upset. I feel like real friends would have canceled the ride and waited for the next Uber.
bqrs63,"YTA, for so many reasons. For a start you seem to think you're above people who are politically active, and think of anyone engaged in activism or current social issues as not having grown out of ""that hippy 18-22 life"". No explanation needed there for why that makes you an asshole. 

Then there's your jokes. You're NTA for making sexist jokes in jest and fun that were well received ... but then they're only really fully jokes if you *don't* believe in what you're saying. And you proceeded when challenged to say that you wouldn't date your girlfriend if she had slept with more men before you, showing that actually you do believe that women ""whoring it around"" gives them less value.

And on top of all that, you seem genuinely confused about why your girlfriend might not be talking to you after you publicly announced to her friends that your relationship with her wouldn't exist if she had ""slutted it up"" before she met you. Like ... wow, son.

YTA on so many levels."
bqrumf,NTA. I’m pushing 30 and wouldn’t sleep on an air mattress in a shared room for free.

bqrxmj,YTA. Wasting other people's time is not cool.
bqrzmu,YTA. I think more than anything that’s too much to ask for. Your basically asking for a stay at home nanny’s erntire salary as play money. 3.5 k a month for 12 months is over 40k. That’s absurd unless your very wealthy.
bqs19j,YTA. You just met her and asking someone about a possibly traumatic event for the sake of making small talk is just never a good idea.
bqs2e6,[deleted]
bqsbkq,"YTA - But not a big one. It's fine to be friendly with people in this situation, but what if one of the other competitors overheard you. What if you really did earn your place in a competition but another competitor overheard a comment like that. It puts everyone in an awkward situation."
bqsh6a,"NAH except for the teacher. If he changed the due date from what’s listed on the syllabus (moved it forward instead of back!!) and didn’t notify anyone other than a brief announcement in class, he messed up big time and she can and should protest that to the school. 

Her grade isn’t your responsibility. If she’d been nice to you, you would have reciprocated. But she wasn’t, and she needs to learn that what you give is what you get, time to grow up!"
bqshti,"Prenote: I read this as ""getting off on my GF's sister"" and I was just really confused for the whole read.

NTA though, I don't agree with your girlfriend, it seems like you're a big part of that girls life and she really looks up to you, that would be hard to talk about but she shared her feelings with you and you were just looking out for her. I just really hope the girl will be okay after this sort of childhood."
bqsi2u,"NAH.
It's understandable that you feel the way you do. You are trying to start a life together. This is something that requires teamwork and communication. Especially when it comes to things like finances and budgeting. Your concerns make sense in that regard.

On the other hand, your gf is just trying to look out for her family.  At the end of the day, its her money and while you are free to make suggestions on how it should be spent, she is also free to ignore that device. 

Is it possible to try and come to a compromise between the two of you? And are you able to move past this if she doesn't compromise/continues to give her family money?

You will soon be living together so this situation needs to be worked out."
bqskcm,"NAH.

If the genders were reversed, you'd do it in a heartbeat and not even think twice about it, right?

From your description, this obsession she has does not sound very healthy. At the least, you could have saved him from some potentially scary stuff, and at best it may lead to her getting the help she clearly needs."
bqsnok,"NTA, I'm a TA and had a student like this last semester. I was getting paid to help her and it still irked me that she got so far in life (we're in grad school) without the ability to find answers to simple questions.

I recommend, since you're not being paid or there explicitly *to* answer questions as I was, be frank: ""Listen, you're in university now. You need to learn to do your own legwork on answering questions. If you ask me a question and I know it's been covered in lecture, the syllabus, the powerpoints, etc. or easily Googleable, I am not going to answer. Feel free to send me a message after you've tried to track it down yourself, though! You'll learn a lot more finding this out for yourself!"""
bqsqnw,NTA. I would call corporate and report all of this. Ask corporate to pull the video surveillance from that night. I bet each and every one of them gets fired. And yes I am THAT petty.

bqsttf,"NAH. You have the right to be upset - and eBay would side with you, the consumer, since the description was not changed. I understand if you don't want to give them red feedback, but the option *is* there. 

It also doesn't sound like they were trying to be vindictive or purposefully be misleading in their listing. That's why I said NAH and that they weren't an asshole either. However, they should've also owned up to the mistake, took the ""loss"", and sent all 3. The baby socks were nice, sure, but it's not what you ordered."
bqsw1e,"NAH.

Sounds like your boyfriend either has some form of anxiety with this type of thing or is just a hypochondriac. You’re not the asshole for being mad, but I don’t think he’s doing it to hurt you, it sounds like it’s generally scaring him. You seriously need to get him into therapy for this and you can’t just wait for him to follow up and do it, you need to take the initiative on it. If not, you might as well break up because it sounds like this is something that’s going to happen more often."
bqswg9,"NTA. Firstly, it's on her for not heeding the obvious warnings posted around. Secondly, monkeys can absolutely scratch up your face when provoked so you made the right call not to approach it. Thirdly, I agree it's actually pretty funny."
bqswml,OFF WITH HIS HEAD
bqsybm,"YTA  And mainly because you feel a little bit jealous of your GF just speaking to her ex even though he lives far away and now you've done her one better by talking to and agreeing to meet one on one with not one but two exes. Nothing good's gonna come from this.
 
Also, these two girls are girls that have mis-interpreted your signals (however mixed they were) in the past. They were totally willing to take the bones you were throwing them hoping it would lead to something more and honestly there's a really good chance that it's happening again. They're ex fuck buddies, not current friends you just so happened to have slept with in the past.
Also, damn, the first time around you can say you didn't mean to be careless with those girls' feelings despite all the messaging and flirting but after the bad blood the first time around, c'mon leave them be."

bqteox,"YTA. My dude, you don't out people unless you have permission. Even if he wasn't gay, that was clearly told to you in confidence. Besides, I can't imagine *anyone* wants their crush being told without their consent. Why would you tell Luke anyway if you know he's straight? Even assuming Stephen was out to him, what is telling a straight guy that a guy likes him going to accomplish except to alienate the two?"
bqtjt0,"NTA, you made plans before she did, I assume you're planning on going t her wedding? That should be enough. I don't like these kinds of parties either, and there are others who feel the same way. Drinking and clubbing simply is not for everyone."

bqtxgg,"NTA No, you have the right to eat.  Your boyfriend needs to figure out how to adjust.  Buy a fan and put white noise on to keep the sounds down or get earplugs but I'd agree it's time for him to put his big boy pants on and figure out a way for HIM to fix HIS problem because blaming everyone else simply for existing isn't the solution.   Time to put the foot down."

He can get his own laptop. It's his fault he's broke."
bqu4jq,"YTA. I’m pretty sure having a nice ring doesn’t mean you’re morally depraved. Are you out there spending all of your time and money trying to fix the world’s problems? Or are you just talking the talk to make yourself feel special?

I fully support her decision as well.  It seems she's level headed and knows the risk and rewards by leaving.  She also has back up plans (hopefully stable ones). 

I hope she gets out and lives a well deserved life."
bqum67,"Lord.  Teenage drama.  NTA.  You are entitled to have a crush on and think any wildly inappropriate thoughts you want about anyone you want, as long as they remain thoughts.  As long as you aren't badgering someone, or trying to convince someone that they really, really want you when they don't, you're entitled to like whoever the hell you want and other people can go pound sand.  Your feelings and your thoughts are your own and nothing to apologize for.  

Again, it's only actions where asshole-ish comes in and doodling some dude's name doesn't even qualify.  Saying that doodling some guy's name is girl behavior like that's a negative thing though, that's bordering on assholeishness.  So smack on the head for that one."

Personally I think you're correct and I don't think it's just a technicality because the show did seem to be trying to make the point that the whole rules around kingship are different now, it's not hereditary, it's elected.

So not only does  being the ruler no longer literally mean sitting on the iron throne or even hanging out in the Red Keep, metaphorically it doesn't involve all the things that the iron throne was a metaphor for either.

OTOH it did very much look like business as usual with the council involving a corrupt brothel-owning master of coin, etc etc so it could be argued the other way as well and that Bran/Keyser Soze is effectively on the iron throne."

It’s not unreasonable to want to spend a portion of your weekend/your dinner with your spouse.

He’s being unreasonable in this case imo, since I’m willing to bet one of those three games could easily choose a different time to play."
bqw6kw,"YTA.  If you don't want to adopt that's fine.  You told your wife that you didn't want to adopt, that's good.  However, rather than actually letting the ""chips fall where they may"" you did an end-around of your wife, went directly to the agency and told them you didn't want to adopt, then told them not to tell your wife so you can hopefully come out of this all clear but also not have to raise some icky adopted baby.  That's an asshole move."

Without litigating on the facts of the inciting argument, don't drop F bombs on kids in a high school class. It's almost over, home stretch.

My parents would just be concerned and like to know where I am. Your mom is just concerned like them, too, I'm sure"
bqxlbb,"NTA, the dad is the asshole, but for the sake of peace I would ask your fiancé. Does she want to stand her ground with you and keep your private proposal? Would she prefer you to do a public proposal? Whatever you decide, if you 2 are a united front then the family can’t do anything 

Edit: you could also compromise and make the proposal not a fake proposal but a “re-proposal”. Say something like” I already asked you once... it was the most perfect day and I will remember that day forever... but for all our friends and family here, I want to ask you again— hopefully you haven’t changed your mind...!

Your brother for not paying you back.  You for thinking it is OK to lock his storage unit.  Clever, but not OK.

If he is refusing to respond and pay you back you should file a small claims court case.  There is nothing saying he will not ignore the judgement, but that is the risk you take when lending money to an irresponsible person.  

Careful with the storage unit shenanigans.  If he is smart he can get that lock removed and potentially press charges for messing with it if you and your husband are not on the lease."

Sounds like your sister has been given a pass to act as she wants because she has autism. Take care of your child first. That’s your priority. 

For reference: I am a parent of a seven year old with autism. While I acknowledge all children are different, my experience tells me there has been some enabling in your sister’s life."
bqyutb,"NTA

Sounds like caretaker burnout. I work in healthcare. Very common among people who have to take care of a family member for an extended amount of time. Especially a high maintenance one. 

Sounds like you need to tell your husband that you are burning out and building a lot of resentment after taking care of MIL for thousands of hours for free.

 Also, you should mention that over the next few weeks you will need to slowly step back and SIL needs to take up the slack. If she does not, MIL will go without, or they will need to hire a part time caretaker , as he did not mention becoming MIL’s domestic servant in the wedding vows. It is unsustainable to continue on."
bqyv0m,"NTA, and also, you're giving your dad wayyyyy too much slack.

It's not on you, as a minor, to explain to your dad that sleeping with someone while going to relationship counseling is a dick move that affects everyone else around him. If he can't figure that out himself, he's an idiot. 

Trying to hold child support payments ransom for a relationship with you is also A) a dick move and B) illegal

Giving you hard liquor as a minor - bad parenting and a dick move. And again, he's an adult. You were a child. Yeah, he didn't ""force"" you to drink it but as a child, the whole point is you're supposed to be able to trust the adults in your life to give you guidance. You don't know enough yet to make informed decisions. You're a *child*. The fact that he has you blaming yourself for it is incredibly manipulative.

To sum up: you didn't deprive yourself of anything. He was never going to be a good father. You've never been an asshole, but you could benefit from some therapy to help you understand: your father is an adult. He made choices. Those choices were not your responsibility at any point. Nothing you said here was your fault, ever. You are not an asshole."
bqyvuq,"NTA.

He's obligated to pay for your sister, not you. You're contributing  to the household bills too, so he's not entitled to your money.

Also, think about moving out without their permission. You're not a child so they can't legally forbid you to.

This is ultimately a situation of boundary setting that your BF has to do with his family.

If someone really loves you, though not hearing it back will hurt, they will not demand that you do it, nor will they judge you for it. (i.e. she doesn't actually love you as much as she will probably claim.)"

br0xui,"YTA. Your text doesn't really seem to be a... joke? Like it's not a play on words, it doesn't have a punchline. It doesn't really make any sense, it basically seems just like a rude/sexist thing to say. If you didn't mean it that way, just apologize, lighten the mood and move on."
br0ypk,"NAH. Everyone processes and reacts to tragedy differently. There is no “right” way to feel or behave, and as long as you’re not unhealthily suppressing emotions you are not required to feel excessive levels of grief.

You say in the title you did not tell your roommate, but then go on to say you did tell her.  Sounds like a bit of a misunderstanding.

Have you two checked with your landlord about subleasing?  Many places do not allow it."
br135t,"YTA. You should have told her that she shouldn't count on being discovered immediately but she should still try in her off time.

Also, have you read some of the absolute crap out there that's popular? I'll quote 50 Shades of Gray when I find a good list.

""Desire pools dark and deadly in my groin.""

 ""Her eyes are brown, like bourbon, but flat.""

 ""'You. Are. Mine,' he snarls, emphasising each word.""

""I have a Christian Grey mix tape in the guise of a high-end iPad.""

""My anxiety level has shot up several magnitudes on the Richter scale.""

Remember that that drivel has three movies, was an international sensation, and started as Twilight fan fiction. Believe in your girlfriend's dreams but suggest that it stays as a side job until she gets discovered.

EDIT: Be sure to check out the parody, 50 Shades of Black. That movie had no right to be as good as it is."

Young children who are overweight are far more likely to have weight-related difficulties later in life. You are well within your rights as parents to decide what kind of food your children do and do not eat, and if your MIL doesn't agree with your decisions, well then MIL loses babysitting privileges.

I would suggest sending the kid with his own food next time MIL inevitably has to watch him though. It sounds like she really doesn't understand what healthy eating and good food means (not uncommon and not necessarily her fault)."
br1efo,"YTA. It’s her wedding, plain and simple. She chooses who comes. You two broke up. You aren’t together currently and wedding costs add up quickly. Also, you’re her bridesmaid. It sounds like you and your ex have some drama currently- she’s probably like to avoid that on her wedding. It has nothing to do with babysitting him - they’re just trying to smooth the fact that they don’t want the drama there. Go, be a bridesmaid, and focus on your sister."

On the contrary, many women grow up being taught that they have to put aside their own desires in order to make men happy, and that they should not under any circumstances rock the boat.

He said, ""That's great, except that I have absolutely no interest in karate."" Point taken. I didn't try to force him into it. I respected his choice and tried to find things he would be interested in instead. I get your mom wanting you to have friends and more experiences.

It sounds like they, and you, are all doing your best to navigate your relationship.  They try to support you, and you try to be good to them in return, although it seems their parenting toolbox may not be as complete as one would hope.

I'm not sure about where you live, but in my country they even call it ""husband stitch"". 

Good for you that your wife took as a joke. But for someone who sees that actually happening and NOT beeing a joke, yes, she was right to bolt it at you. The nurse had no wat to know, tho, and her job was to take care of your wife and kid, not your feelings."
br4m2e,"NTA. She doesn’t get to berate you over something that she said to go book. Also, there’s a big double standard that she’s imposing on you.

br5czp,"NAH but you should consider divorce. And I don't mean that lightly. 

I grew up in the household you described. It was miserable only having access to my dad when a game wasn't on. And football goes into baseball which goes into golf which goes into football season. My family prioritized sports so much I had no one to drive me to after school activities because my brother was in hockey, baseball, and football. My holidays are remembered as miserable because we'd have to watch sports at all of them. I have no nice memories of my grandpa because whenever he visited he ignored us to watch sports. 

So unless you're willing to commit to sports forever yourself, you're looking at decades without holidays. Decades without vacations because ""we gotta get back in time for the game."" And god forbid you have children who aren't sports fanatics. As it is, do you think he'll get up to take care of a sick baby if his favorite team is playing? What if it's the playoffs?"

br6507,"NTA for that specifically, but from the way you’re describing it, you aren’t proud of/don’t respect her or the degree she has earned.

br66d1,"NTA it sounds like your mom doesn't  seem to understand how abusive your brother is and how hard he gets to you. 

It doesn't sound like your mom will back you up though, so maybe try other options? You could leave the house when your brother comes over or lock yourself in your room?  You can have everything ready and ho on a day trip with your kid to the zoo or something cheaper like a hike or a park.

br6ahz,"Ywbta (but a loving, awesome asshole).  It’s just my opinion, but it’s obviously hurting her, thinking you won’t be there.

You could always compromise and say you’ll be there later in the day, like for dinner, then go through with your surprise of getting there early.  She obviously loves you a lot, and I see no reason to stress her out over this, it just seems (unintentionally) cruel.

Your parents are unlikely to ever have a civil relationship, and at this point, pretending the other doesn’t exist is probably for the best for everyone involved.  The ONLY person who might have standing to say something to your dad is your brother - he could say, “When you do things like that, you take the focus away from my kids’ birthday, and on special days like that, the last thing I want is anger and tension in the house.  If you can’t be there because you can’t be in the same room, I understand.”"

br9coe,"NTA - Gonna give you a break on this one because normally snooping is an immediate asshole-move.  But if my significant other suggested swapping sexual partners in our entirely monogamous relationship it would be a huge red flag and I'd probably have to check as well.  She probably hasn't cheated, of course.  But she hasn't been open with you, which means she was likely entertaining the possibility.  I would always keep my partner in the loop if I had made a new friend/acquaintance, especially given your status.  Sending you both the same intimate and playful picture just leaves a bad taste in my mouth as well."

A couple of things, elsewhere OP said that the other people invited were other family, so not one friend of OP was invited to a party FOR OP? That isn't a party for OP anymore

Some people are saying OP didn't handle it maturely, and whilst maybe that's fair, OP shouldn't have to hang around at a party OP doesn't want to have, especially when it's meant to be for OP. At the very very most you could make a claim for everyone, but people saying asshole seem to not have remotely read the post, or don't know the rules, because there is no way going completely against someone's wishes and then framing that it is ""for them"" doesn't make you an AH. I still stand by not 100%

Edit 2:

Hi everyone coming from the meta post lmao"
br9gzt,"I think YTA, you haven't gotten round to going in OVER A YEAR? That's on you for being mad, he can't wait forever for something you might never do"
br9jvl,INFO what kind of weird-ass operation are they running over there?
br9m76,"NTA, but I would seriously consider telling your GF. This Alice doesn't seem to understand no, and it's easier to say something now that try to explain why you didn't say anything when it escalates further. And it will escalate."
br9q4t,"NTA. You did not do it to intentionally hurt him. You did not take anyone home to your shared place or rub his face in it. Nor did you intend for him to find out. 

He is entitled to his feelings I guess, but he is definitely TA for snooping. And taking away your keys was way over the line."
br9qcv,NTA if you don’t want to be friend just stop talking to them you don’t really need to tell them that you don’t like them that would make you the asshole
br9qni,[deleted]
br9r83,"NTA, I'm pretty polite and this is not a situation where a please was called for, only a thank you upon receiving the package.

She was also rude in the way she handled it."
br9tjz,"NTA

\>> He started saying that I must work out with a nice figure like mine

This is where things got creepy."
br9u11,NTA. Why is your boyfriend tracking you without your permission? That is some seriously controlling behavior.
br9unw,NAH -  if you’re juts being spiteful then you’re kind of an asshole but asking someone to help you move is a big deal.   I wouldn’t help anyone move but I also wouldn’t ask anyone to help me move either.
bra5cr,"YTA. Here’s why:

>I still have not explicitly mentioned the sex abroad because it would definitely hurt her feelings

If you know something you did would hurt her feelings, and you choose to keep it secret, you are controlling her reality in order to manage her feelings.

And in all likelihood, this is more about the fact that her bad feelings might lead to a break up or a painful situation for You, and you want to avoid that."
bra5fd,"NTA they’re your chairs, they were specifically given to you by their owner."
bra64t,"NTA, if he needs emotional support, he has a wife. My wife would change ANY plans if I needed emotional support, I wouldn’t even have to ask. And vice versa. Something is off."
brack8,NTA..... Splitting the bill when everyone is eat and drinking different things is a shit idea and shouldn't be done.

braqms,"YTA, you don't know his circumstances (your asst principal probably knows the cause but can only talk in hypotheticals to respect the other kid's privacy) and you seem to have no regrets about being a bully."
bratc2,"YTA. Don’t offer to do something you don’t actually want to do, just to get mad when they accept your offer."
braus1,NTA but call social services?
brausq,"As someone with mild aviophobia, probably not as bad as you though, I am actually going to say ESH.

&#x200B;

They need to be more understanding. I hate flying and I feel uneasy the entire time and can't really eat etc but can distract myself with films etc.

&#x200B;

You, however, need to stop letting you anxiety control you. It is a long flight, sure, but you can do so much to get through it. You can watch a film, buy puzzle books at the airport, get some medication from your doctor, etc. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes you have to face your fears. What you are describing right now is an anxiety problem rather than aviophobia. You are anxious at the thought of being anxious. Just let that sink in for a minute. You are wasting your life being anxious about potential anxiety. 

&#x200B;

20 hours is a long time. You will likely be able to sleep for a lot of it."
brawrz,"YTA here - but I don't mean that. I just mean I think it would be better for the two of them to have that conversation, awkward or not. i feel it may overstep boundaries slightly, especially as you haven't seen him in 15 years?"
braxt3,"NTA, especially since he knew this was something you weren't comfortable with. 

On an unrelated note, please leash your dog when you're taking walks. Even the best trained dogs should always be leashed in public."
brayou,NTA it was a bad gift and a huge burden. Have you told him before you don’t really want to drive and were only learning for him? Why does he care so much?
brb3sz,NTA- normally stories like this I sympathize with the employees but what the hell is going on here.
brb5g9,"NTA. Lol they 100% deserved it and hey, your wife should've stuck up for you if she didn't want you to take this route! It's your house, if you're paying the bills they get off the TV when you ask them to"
brb81b,YWBTA if you didn't confront your father about it first. Get the proper intel before you do something drastic.
brbjf6,"NTA,

It’s smart to have as many layers of protection you can afford. Pregnancy is life altering and if you’re not ready i wouldn’t take any chance."
brbjot,"YTA. He shouldn’t have to live with your mess. Supporting your doing better in school doesn’t mean cleaning up after you. If you had a conversation and specifically said you need him to take over your share of housework, my answer would be different."
brbjou,"At the moment you haven't tried any other options at all so, yes, YWBTA."
brblzs,YTA for cursing at children and writing a confusing post.
brbqhi,"NTA- I would do the same thing. Who goes out, goes to there ex’s house and stays the night drunk, and accuses there SO of not trusting them? You need to seriously re evaluate you’re life if you think you’re even close to being in the wrong."
brbsej,"NTA

Your dad is wrong for expecting you to be cool with a replacement mother. She can never be replaced and that lady should have chosen her words way better."
brbxsb,[deleted]
brc5le,"NAH: It sounds like maybe he's trying to accomplish everything at once. I think you're okay to say 'I'm not really able to learn this way' and if it keeps happening, you can ask a manager to intervene."
brc8q5,"YTA.

Glasses, especially powerful prescription glasses, can be extremely expensive. They’re a medical device. If an asthmatic said some nasty things to you would you toss their inhaler away, too? If someone in a wheelchair was mean would you kick them out of it and throw it in a lake? 

Regardless of her comments, what you did was unacceptable."
brc918,NTA also your mom and this guy need to split up ASAP.
brc9mi,"NAH, he sounds like he's depressed and may need some kind of therapy.  I'd suggest this to him and see what his reaction is.  If he reacts poorly, then I think you're in the right to be questioning the longevity of this relationship if he's always negative."
brca93,"NTA: You got all the information about the leak and decided it wasn't an emergency. She still had heating and hot water, it was just more an inconvenience. Trying to compromise by making it a next day appointment should have sufficed. The daughter saying what she said about the person (not knowing it was you) should be shot for it, was way overboard."
brccr6,"NTA - he should have done more research. You agreed to pay a certain amount, he can’t change it after the fact."
brceym,YTA - it’s your sister’s wedding. Its her decision and I totally understand trying to avoid stress on a ridiculously stressful day. It’s not for him it’s for her.
brcgcz,"YTA

He’s doing a positive thing for the wider community. You say yourself you don’t need the money. I think it’s reasonable for him to keep back 10% of his wage to do something positive that he wants to do in this circumstance. 

It would be different if you did need the money or if he was controlling all the finances or some such."
brchoi,"They’re not really jokes. It’s fine to retell a joke and people in the group might even laugh and say “oh I’ve heard that one before” but telling a joke isn’t the same as what the coworker is doing, he’s taking stories that happened to other people and dishonestly presenting them as his own which is odd and I understand why OP is bothered by it. 

Imagine if you told a story to a friend about how a cashier was rude to you and you said something funny back to them, then later you were with that friend and a group and the friend told the story but said that it happened to him, would you not think “hey that happened to me, why’d he tell it like it was his story?”

Edit- I’d like to add that I wouldn’t call him out on it, especially in a public manner. But I get why it’s annoying"
brcj4e,NTA - sounds to me like you dodged a bullet with this one.  She sounds high maintenance and full of drama.
brclve,NTA at all. I would appreciate something like that! I think it makes you look good - like you're trying to save them the extra stress.
brcm7g,"NTA

You have offered reasonable compromises.  You do you."
brcnnb,NTA
brcnqi,NTA but holy shit you need to get away from your brother. CREEP alert.
brcnu3,"NTA, but something to understand here -- this is not your dog, technically. This is your mom's dog. If you can't be home to take care of the dog, then there's going to be no real way for you to seriously police the dog's diet. All you're going to do is cause problems with the douche bag who's abusing (yes, *abusing*) your dog unless you can find some way to take it with you or rehome it, because he's a douche bag who's never going to listen to you."
brcp5e,NAH. You can't read people's minds. End of story.
brcp8i,"NTA.  What she did is incredibly rude.  Has she never heard of calling someone back?  The fact that she spoke about his dick issues at lunch, for 45 minutes no less, in front of someone, is all levels of inappropriate."
brcqm8,"NTA: Lots of people have destination weddings, and you might just have to accept that some people can't attend. If she's not helping you pay for it, she doesn't get to tell you where to have it."
brcs5c,"NTA

You own the place, and you made specific rules that she broke. You gave a simple request, and it was not followed, so you're not an asshole for kicking her out."
brctlf,"YTA. while I agree that dude did sound creepy, but Im in my 30s and just started rollerblading again. If a mom came up to me and told me to leave it tell her to go fuck herself.

I have as much right to use a public space as you and your brood."
brctvy,"YTA. You promised your kids you'd pay for their weddings.  You have no money issues and have a strong belief that this one will last.  In essence, you're trying to use this $40k to strongarm them into the wedding that you want them to have, or don't want them to have as it may. Just give them the $40k, tell them you'd prefer they use the money for something else, but that in the end it's theirs to do with as they wish"
brcuou,"NTA

You communicated clearly. Not your fault people didn't listen."
brcyxq,NTA. Business is business.
brd0bj,NTA For removing toxic people.
brd0s2,"YTA 

As a veteran, I think what you alluded to was wrong. When asked, you should not have said Air Force as you are not a member of the Air Force. You are a cadet. You should have said you were a cadet in the civil air patrol. You are not actively serving in the military. You have not enlisted nor are you commissioned. I volunteer a lot of my time to charities and organizations I believe in. I do not feel that I am entitled to any special privileges because of that. So stating “I give a lot of my time” to justify this, is a no go. The soldiers or air men had every right to be upset. The sacrifices made by service members go beyond just deployments."
brd0w4,INFO how old are you?
brd245,"NTA, people who like anime are not oppressed, and don't get to appropriate victimizing terms like ""slur"" as if they've been victims of institutionalized oppression or violence."
