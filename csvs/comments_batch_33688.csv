brd77g,"NTA - I have a friend who smokes and making jokes about it is commonplace, so long as your not guilt tripping theres no problem, sounds like your friend is just a pussy"
brd9hu,"NTA

You can't control the actions of others. You can only control your own. Your ex does not care about you any more and he is not going to put any effort into making your life any easier. Of course this annoying, but you are just going to have to learn to live with it and not let it get under your skin. 

Getting aggravated over every little slight is a losing strategy. Of course it is not fair, but you are going to have to practice not caring. This will take away his power and your frustration."
brdfbv,NTA you're under no obligation to like anyone. but if you want to continue this relationship you're going to have to learn to either distance yourself whenever possible or come up with some pretty creative coping mechanisms.
brdmmy,"NTA- edited to add this. It's not your fault he sucks both at the gym and at managing his own commitments.

INFO, what the fuck kind of lifting routine is your boyfriend doing where he is limping for DAYS after a workout?!"
brdne1,"NTA 

You didn't interfere nor did you make your mom do anything. She made that decision all on her own using the information you provided. Information she absolutely deserved to know. You're ok. You did nothing wrong. 

In fact, I think you did exactly the right thing."
brds7b,"NTA 

No, depression does not make you a super creep asking for nudes. No, depression won't make you go ""crazy"" in the senses you'll do stupid, hurtful stuff like he's doing.

He's a liar and he's using it as an excuse."
brdspq,NAH - You don’t owe anyone friendship or any other type of relationship at your own extent. Ever. Maybe try to let her down gently though.
brdy83,"NAH

My dad does the same thing, albeit a little bit better. 

&#x200B;

Example as a kid:

&#x200B;

""Hey Dad I got 95% on my math test!""

""Good job son, now what could you have done to get the remaining 5%?""

&#x200B;

Recognition of achievements is always good for children. Positive reinforcement to let them know what they're doing is good. But, there's ALWAYS room for improvement in anything you do. Your parents' job is to raise you into adulthood and help you reach your maximum potential as a person and human being. Your Dad seems to have had those intentions in mind when he refused to acknowledge your achievements to devoid your mindset of complacency and a striving to always do better. Could he have done better? Yea, probably, but that doesn't make him an A-hole when its pretty clear he loves and cares for you.

&#x200B;

Sometimes parental methods get lost in translation, so I don't blame you for interpreting his responses this way, but I would be inclined to believe your Dad has the best in mind for you based on how you described him."
brdyqo,"NTA, but don't be shocked if it severely damages your relationship with the acquaintance.  Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems the only time he said anything about you not sharing the information was after you had already talked to the school and potentially after he was contacted by HR. 

Most importantly: WHY IS WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR FOUR YEAR OLD'S CLASS SOME BIG SECRET THAT YOU CAN'T BE MADE AWARE OF?  That aspect of this is sheer bullshit and the only reason I can think of is to reduce school liability for continuing to keep your child unmonitored in a situation where he is being physically assaulted."
bre00n,NTA but seems kind of tactless to do that at graduation; it's a huge celebration and seems this could've waited. He didn't have to be a dick though.
bre5k2,"YTA stop parenting your brother, that's not your job."
bre6oh,"NTA. That is a stupid position to be put into and she shouldn't be asking those things of you. Since she opened the door for you to talk to him about her gripes, then the door is already open for you to tell him about how she is acting."
bre6u3,"NTA for wanting her to get rid of pictures about the ONS.

ESH if you are insisting she get rid of photographs that are not relevant to the ONS."
bre7el,"NTA, your girlfriend is over reacting. It depends a bit with how much current contact you're having, it's definitely a red flag if you're still texting an ex every day, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. I get that she has trust issues but in the end that's not something that falls on you."
bre8gq,"NTA, it's weird your boyfriend believes this guy over you. Are they friends or something? But yeah, I'd be pissed off too if my partner didn't believe my word."
bre9jb,"YTA. It’s not a religious tradition anymore, it’s become a social traditional over the years. It’s not that difficult to just remove your hat at their request. You can say it’s silly and antiquated, but you’re making a stand for atheism where there’s no need for one at all. If your main reason was just “it’s more comfortable to wear one than to not” then yeah sure you could make that argument and express that to them, but turning around and saying “I refuse to take off my hat because it’s a dumb religious tradition I will not be a part of as an atheist” YTA and will likely just confuse your parents because, like I said, it’s not a religious tradition anymore. It’s something you do in polite society."
breab7,"YTA. Everything sounded fun and exciting... until the dicks. You really could have just foregone the dicks. This is your workplace, not a bachelorette party."
brebg7,"NTA: IF you do help, ask for payment."
brebt9,"NTA. If there's no sign, there's no reason for you to assume the cement is wet."
bredim,Consider this one on the house.
brej2t,"NTA, modding is a thankless job."
brels8,YTA.  You can disagree with someone without having to put them down .  Very childish
bremxf," NTA -  he doesn’t get to treat you that way.  He’s an asshole plain and simple.  He should apologize to you not the other way,  you didn’t do anything wrong."
brentp,"YTA. YTA. YTA. Keep that shit out of the wilderness for fuck's sake. People aren't climbing mountains to deal with your stupid toy. It's so rude and disruptive, even if you think you're being ""polite"" or whatever. You're like those assholes who let their dogs run off leash and blast music on speakers so everyone around them can hear. Absolutely ruins the outdoors experience unless you're a 18 year old frat boy."
breoav,NTA - you had right of way and you stopped for the kids...
breodp,"NTA if you told her not to eat or drink in it, she shouldn’t have."
breot3,NTA. Why is it any of his business
breq4r,ESH -  dude you worry too much and really overthinking this and your wife is pretty insensitive.
breqwp,"NTA. Expose the liars, ruin the pastor. Burn it all down."
brerkq,NTA. -  it’s more than an accusation when you have actual proof.    It’s not even debateable
brerxa,"NAH - seems like a this is too much celebrating for one birthday. And even if it wasn't, you're all adult, you had plans, you told husband about them before, it shouldn't be a big deal. Would they think this is a big deal?"
bres5f,"NTA. You're scheduled to work, you make arrangements for childcare, you turn down plans, you count on that money for your bills... which leads to if you're scheduled, you get paid.  Even if you go home early, you should still get paid for your scheduled time"
bresz6,"NTA

Not seeing eye to eye on financial issues has been the death of many a relationship. If you can't compromise on these issues without resentment, there is no future to this relationship."
brew76,"NTA for thinking it, it might very well be true, but you'd be going over the line if you actually called him out on it. Bi people deal a lot with people thinking they're just after attention, and if he's actually bi you'd be a huge fucking asshole if you tried to call him out on this. Just think it, but keep your mouth shut."
brexff,NTA /. Your ac is broke so of course you lost your cool!
brey8s,Not going to give you a judgment. There is way more going on here then this sub is intended to handle. I feel like there is a lot to this story being left out as well.
brf04r,"NTA. Sometimes we have to take jobs we don't like to cover life expenses in between jobs we do like. Not enjoying work isn't a reason to not do it and mooch off of you in the way that he is. From what you've described, it sounds like he has a fear of responsibility, and that is not a very good quality to have in a life partner. I think you are well within your right to tell him to get some kind of job, where he could at least help you pay for groceries and utilities or something, while he looks for something better. You aren't his mommy."
brf30q,"NAH. That t-shirt is probably the most disgusting way that trashy people have used to exploit Kurt Cobain's work and death for profit (and I'm by no means a devotee, I just think we should let the poor man be); I would have expressed the same concerns you did. As an adult, and a parent, you have a better understanding of the meaning of the note, and why it's at best disrespectful to its subject. 

But your daughter's friend is 15 years old and at that age angst is practically its own language. Any 15 year old who wears a shirt like that isn't going to change out of it because someone's mother told her to, even if someone's mother is totally right."
brf8lj,"NTA because you interjected out of what you thought was a courteous gesture. You didn’t do it to throw her under the bus, and honestly it’s so insignificant there’s really no reason for her to be this offended. You also didn’t say something like “she was just being nosy and wanted to know”, you just kept it as neutral as possible. I doubt John thought anything of it, and it’s just your coworker being paranoid."
brfago,"NAH. Her mental health and safety is not your responsibility. It'd be nice of you if you stayed, but I recommend against sacrificing significant parts of your life for her. If she can't be alone at home for a week when she's well into adulthood, as she is, she should be living in an assisted care home. Her younger sibling should not have to put their life on hold each time the parents are out of town.

Consider suggesting that they have a carer come by to help with the basics every day during that week."
brfb71,"NTA, but you need to approach it carefully as some people find talking about their finances very touchy."
brfdrg,"NTA-  You can't be expected to take on more burdens when you are already just getting by. 

Why is your mother so unprepared for retirement? Seems like that would be of her own doing."
brfg6x,"NAH. As being a previous 7 y/o gamer girl: I do recommend asking if you & your girlfriend can introduce yourselves over voice chat to the parents/guardians of her, tho. It's important for them to be involved, especially because of the age difference."
brfhdg,"NTA.

His behavior is intrusive and obsessive. If he won't respect your wishes, it's better to stop confiding in him."
brfmhi,NTA - you owe no one a relationship
brfo9q,"ESH. Not because you ""took advantage of her"", because in my opinion you didn't (it seems she was sober, or close to sober, at that point), but because she has a boyfriend and you seem to have known about that. You both let yourselves be put in a situation where this could've happened and you both knew better."
brftei,"YTA: It's one day, your mom and dad have no issue with it....and who are those days about? Them, not you. Just suck it up. Does she bitch about the other 364 days of the year having to clean and cook or whatever she does taking care of the family?"
brfvkv,"Changed to NTA

When did you tell FIL that you would never camp there?"
brg363,YTA.  These are her friends.  It's for her to manage if any of them express more than platonic feelings.  She can't just magic up new female friends.  She can't make people be friends with her.  Making friends is also pretty tiring.  Pushing her to be friends with random people she meetings is weird and invasive.
brg4z1,"NAH, as someone who has social anxiety I fully understand why it would upset you but knowing that people without social anxiety don't have that train of thought. Your friend had a problem and found a solution. Nothing wrong with any of it."
brg5pe,"NTA

Sounds like she's making up excuses and has some other reason to bail."
brg8k5,"NTA.  You made an anonymous call for this very reason.  If you tell them that you did, you probably will be cut off from visiting.  It's better that you lie and keep an eye on these kids.  Good work bud.  Stay on top of it."
brgcdo,"NTA. I’m guessing you work in some type of production line that has to run 24 hours? Because my job does the same thing. It’s your time off, if your company cares so little about you that they want to work you to death... lie away. I would recommend using that time to try and find a new job though."
brgczx,My ex's dog would shit on the carpet multiple times a week and it never changed. So that won't exactly work depending on what type of person her husband is. Some people are actually okay with that type of shit and they make excuses.
brgjt2,NTA. You should have put up those screenshots. It would be a good warning for any potential girl he might try to be his “future baby mama”
brgndo,YTA. There is a line. Go to the end of it.
brgpm3,"NAH/YTA. I've been there, and I understand your POV completely. However, she did choose you as a friend over him as a boyfriend, so I think you should consider exactly what you're choosing to give up. Maybe bond with other people a little more at school, find a new crush. Because you've got a really cool best friend."
brgsjr,"If you guys agreed that she would pay you back, then NTA. It’s a little unclear if this was specifically stated."
brgtyt,"NTA.

At 2+ years old, they're old lady rats. Which is not to say they don't deserve the best life possible, but even if money were no object, the older they are, the harder recovering from major surgery would be. It comes down to quality vs quantity of life, imho.

So as long as they're happy and not in any pain, I think you're within your rights to spare them the surgery. Just don't keep them alive and miserable because you can't let go; when their quality of life deteriorates, do them the favor of letting them go peacefully to sleep, not having to suffer."

brgueh,"NTA. Jesus this sub must be full of stay at home soccer moms, every thread dealing with kids is so touchy. It's 2 months folks, OP is not asking her sister to lock it up for a year. Being that her sister is prone to impulsive decisions, maybe she neglected to take the wedding into factor? GD..."
brguvb,"NAH if everyone is under 15, ESH if over - because this is one of the stupidest things I’ve tried to comprehend."
brgx1f,"NTA, as hurt as he is about dipping into your rainy day fund that is literally what the fund is for. If you guys have your finances set up in a way for you to have personal funds to spend on things then you can spend it on whatever you want."
brgxj3,"I think as the SO in question I probably shouldn't respond, but I say NAH. I know it's hard to say that stuff, and yes I feel a tiny bit bad about doing things when you were in said bubble, but now I know so I won't do it again, though please be a little more open about it. You know I won't judge you about that stuff, okay?"
brh1gg,"NTA: You made the world a little better, dude sounds like a scumbag."
brh3np,"NTA. He probably assumed ""oh I guess I came on too strong and she didn't like that so time to move on."" When she didn't respond for *days*. Like, cmon, days?!"

brhgfi,NTA but it sounds like your parents need to work something out with the cats
brhgg8,"NTA. Two ceremonies is extremely common for couples of differing faiths, cultures, or geographic origins. Not that everything is “breakup worthy”, but seriously consider what it’ll be like marrying a man who’s entirely unwilling to share one day of his life to honor and respect something this important to you."
brhlb8,"NTA. It’s not a money thing the way I see it - it’s a trust thing. Legally he’s in the clear, but he really shouldn’t have snatched the old contract from under your nose if he cared about your friendship. That’s a pretty shady thing to do, and it reveals that he cares more about the money than breaking your trust. He took advantage of you and you’re looking for him to show that he’s willing to change that. Best of luck!"
brhmsk,It's... A graduation for kindergarten. It's not a big deal.

brhtfw,"Probably NAH, but it really depends on the group dynamics as far as how it will *actually* play out to bring your own food.  We don’t have nearly enough info to judge that.  Whatever though, I’m a picky eater too, so go for it if that’s what you want.  

I don’t see how you think you can eat for four days on less than $23 though."

brhxql,"YTA.

If she was doing those things when you two first started dating, you knew what you were getting into. It's unhealthy to go into a relationship expecting to change someone."
bri1ut,Just change your privacy settings so you have to approve tags of yourself before anyone can see them. Then it wont say op was tagged in a post for anyone to see. I've had to do the same with my mother so i understand. You're not wrong..its an invasion of your privacy.
bri3nd,"NAH, but goddamn 1200 for just being a guest at a wedding? Is everyone they know besides you rich? Because I sure as shit couldn't ask all my closest friends and family to cough up that kinda dough, even with 6 months notice."
bri6e9,NTA. If she wants to take them away for a weekend she can do it on a weekend that they are with her.
briamb,"ESH.  If you are going to be in a serious relationship with someone who has kids, then you are going to be expected to parent them.   With that said, he shouldn’t use you as a babysitter.  The responsibilities of raising the kids should be balanced.  From what you describe it sounds a bit out of whack at the moment."
bribj4,NTA. Your mom is weird.
bricfm,Nah. She wanted to play but obviously that would be weird
briguv,"Wow.  That's the hardest AITA I've read in a long time.

You're ethically compromised either way.  It's probably best you stay out of it.

Edit: I can't possibly respond to all the comments this comment is getting, sorry.  Scroll further for more in-depth discussion of the subject.  As to why this got so many updoots, I guess it's because I was the first, or one of the first, people to comment."
brih18,"NTA, first that is weird and you need privacy. Second, if they made you a promise but dont fulfill it they are at fault"
brihap,NTA. I think you should report him to his boss.
briib7,"NTA.  You are entitled to privacy.  Also, get a lock on the door already!"
briku1,"ESH

You may be a bit of an asshole, but they deserved that and you didn't cause any harm.  It's actually pretty funny."
brilpq,"YTA simply because you think of yourself as better than her because you have fewer sexual partners.. “I for one value relationships so I don’t have one night stands” ... you can value relationships and still have one night stands. 

I understand being insecure when finding photos that weren’t sent to you, however, making snide comments about what she wears to a music festival? Buddy, you’re way too insecure. 

If you cannot get over her sexual past which has literally nothing to do with you unless she contracted an STI, then I suggest you break up simply because you view her as lesser and will never be comfortable knowing her past."
brin1g,"Yeah, you're fine here. She may not have been comfortable with the question asked directly to her, and it may be an answer you have to figure out yourself, but you didn't do anything wrong except one thing. Donate the money?! No way, Jose. Keep all that shit for yourself"
brio2d,"""Boys will be boys"" is not a legitimate excuse for anything, especially not someone touching you inappropriately and treating you like shit. You should flat out refuse to just like the guy because they want you to. He doesn't deserve it."
briqn0,"Uhm, yeah, you're not over reacting, NTA. She's not hanging out with her stepbrother at this point, she's hanging out with an ex. It's fairly normal not to want your girlfriend to have close relationships with exes. Obviously she can't cut him out completely but it wouldn't be wrong of you to confront her about this and telling her to dial it back some, or a lot, for your comfort. If she argues, ask her how she'd feel if you had similar closeness to an ex of yours."
brirx3,"NTA. She basically did the lesbian version of ""nice guy""-ing you here. You're not cruel for not wanting to date her; her having longstanding feelings doesn't entitle her to your romantic affection and this whole ploy to live with you and ultimately somehow entice you to be with her is pretty gross. You didn't owe her a more gentle let down after her dramatic reveal that your whole friendship was just a plot to date you."
briups,"ESH. If you can't make it, wait longer or take a different route."
briyyi,"NTA  I have lost more than one friend in this ""Showers"" People shouldn't assume that they can dictate how much you spend in these things. 

&#x200B;

However I think you should have stated in the beginning what kind of Baby shower can you throw (I have learned this over time) by example:  "" Hey friend I want to make a very intimate Baby shower for you, I want to make it at\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_how many persons\_\_\_. Would you like that? ""  and then she can tell you ""oh thanks but I want so and so"" and then you can tell her ""I'm sorry that that is outside my possibilities to organize it, but I would love to attend. ""    

&#x200B;

I think most of the time these showers get out of hand because we are afraid to speak up till the wave is too high and we may drown otherwise."
brj0ld,"NTA, contract said sold as is, any problems are his, not yours. It’s nice you offered to help, but that’s at your discretion and you can terminate that whenever you want. Maybe not with a “fuck off!” though lmao"
brj0y0,"I feel like I'm going to get backlash but NTA. I'm familiar with this scenario (Snapchat is notorious) and I feel like he's not being completely honest. It might be ""friends"" now but if she continues to give him the attention he might need right now, then he'll be sure to stray from the flock."
brj1ra,"NAH, Honestly dude, nobody actually wants to go to graduation. It's for the people that care for us and want to see us succeed. I'm sure graduation is an important milestone for your life, but it also is an important milestone for you mother as a parent. You do you dude, but i'd suck it up for her."
brj368,"ESH She didn’t respect your wishes, the way you kicked her out was kind of rude, but if you both have already made up then that’s great. It shows that your relationship is a lot stronger than others you see on this subreddit :)"
brj7aq,"NTA, but I’d suggest talking with your son about these concerns first. It’d be a really weird position to put him in to wait until Luca is already invited by your son only to be turned away at the door. Telling your son can prevent this from playing out."
brjk75,"ESH . I do agree that “Fox” is a silly name. However, I do think it was inappropriate of you to make fun of the baby’s name at the baby shower and in front of the baby’s parents. The baby’s parents suck for naming their poor kid “Fox”."

brk3e0,"YTA dude, there were plenty of times you could have been real with the person and told them how you actually felt. It’s called communication, and only one person in this story was utilizing it."
brk6ae,"NTA - Bad idea to fuck him though. He was clearly out for a relationship the entire time, fucking him was going to lead to him acting like a twat about it. Not that it's your fault at all.

brk73z,"NTA. As long as you don’t go out of your way to be unkind to her, you’ve done nothing wrong."

Keith's finding himself.  Relationships come and go.  You didn't 'hurt keith to the point where he no longer felt your relationship could continue'

It's just a side-effect of re-evaluating things.  A common denominator in that sort of line of thinking is that everything is bad, and must be reassessed.  He's probably trying to get away from something, but might not know what that could be.  The comment, while might be in bad taste, just caused him to aim that cannon at you.

brkkwn,"Nah

She is entitled to leave not being comfortable with your relationship with Alex and you're entitled to your relationship with Alex. 

She just decided she can't deal with it and that's ok."
brkr5i,"ESH. The contract is clearly designed to punish her - she cheated, you didn't, all the contract says is that if someone is unfaithful then they get slammed. Is there anything in the contract about you pulling away and becoming distant again, and a punishment for that?

Emotional/relationship aspects aside, only an idiot would sign this contract. You're asking her to waive rights she already has, with no consideration given to her - she can only lose. If you had gone half in on a winning lottery ticket but got in a fight with your friend and said some vile things to them and they said they'd only be your friend again if you signed a contract giving up your half of the winnings if you ever said vile things to them again, what would you do? Sign or walk away and take the half you're already getting?

I get the betrayal and anger and pain, but your wife is right. Either you're in it or you're not. You're well within your rights to end it now. If you do want a ""contract"" of some kind, it needs to be fair to both sides - right now it's solely one-sided and even if she did sign it, it's unlikely to hold up in court as a result.

A better contract would lay out requirements like ""must go to couple's counseling at X frequency until both parties agree to reduce frequency/end counseling"", ""must have a date night every X weeks/days"", and so forth. Items that both parties must put in effort for in order to make the marriage work, and if either party doesn't then the marriage is doomed to fail. But the penalty of losing your entire life accumulation of assets *and* your children is so severe I wouldn't expect anyone to ever sign it."
brkwsc,NTA. It's your ceremony mate. Do what you want. Something I'd definitely say though is don't regret finishing later. That's bs. Be proud you finished regardless of reason. I finished later than planned and was still proud I got through it in the end. I found people more congratulatory to me as an older student as it's a rarer thing. Be chuffed mate but do what you feel you wish to whether you attend or not.

brl15i,"NTA Personally I think he knew exactly who you were and said it on purpose because he was mad at your boyfriend for mocking him but wasn’t actually brave enough to stand up to his mates ribbing him.

brl21s,"NTA. 
Mental illness isn't a free pass to be a dick to people. You don't have to put up with it if it brings you down. She's a bad roommate and it's kind of you to cut her some slack because of her illness. But if she's pushing you too far then you're not an asshole for wanting her gone."
brl28a,"ESH, except your mum. 

I think it’s obvious why your brothers are the assholes. You on the other hand, need to know time and place. You reprimanded your brothers for good reason but the timing just wasn’t appropriate. You could’ve pulled them aside after the main celebration was over rather than bursting out in front of your mum."
brl7cm,"YTA you don’t destroy your child’s possessions for misbehaving. What does that teach her? That she can destroy people’s things to get back at them or to manipulate their feelings. This isn’t healthy, and she likely won’t forget this. 

What good did this do? Did it make you feel better? Do you think this really taught her a lesson or just made her angry with you and lose trust in her mother?

You should apologize and let her know that what you did wasn’t okay, so she won’t believe that is an okay way for her to behave in the future. Punish her in a fair and reasonable way. Or sit down and have a heart to heart with her, and explain what she should be doing differently."

Weird how you agree not to get gifts for such a big birthday, even just a small acknowledgement that it was her 30th would have gone a long way. 30 is a big birthday and you appeared to ignore the significance for her. Maybe she was still hoping that you'd pull out the stops."

What happens if you're in a lower paying job for the next 5 years? How does that affect your shared goals? How does that affect marriage and kids (if planning to have any)?

Plenty of people commute more than you plan to for work, but it is a huge strain on relationships. It takes a certain kind of relationship and security and flexibility to make it work.

Think beyond the lens of your relationship. If you were in his city, alone, taking the job you could get. How would you feel?

Even for a non-traditional family, this would shock any parent. Based on how you talk, you sound like you're almost trying too hard to rebel, like you're purposefully trying to upset them, which kind of comes with being 17. On one hand, I get it. Trust me, I get it. On the other hand, you may want to try a dose of self-awareness. You don't see why your parents might be upset? Try to look at it from their perspective.

In the heat of the moment you all probably said stuff that seemed extreme to the other side. This will cool down, and it's all part of the shocks of an immigrant family from a strict culture."

What does Ashley looking up to you mean to your wife? This might be too far but if anything I feel like your wife should look at you with pure admiration! You're being incredibly kind to someone whose life would be truly worse without you. Your wife is just jealous that it's to another woman.

brqx89,"Kinda YTA. It’s common for people who cut ties with religion to go completely “counterculture”. Whether you are for or against marrying cousins, you are judging your sister for who she loves. She was never raised to believe it was wrong and frankly, I don’t see how this has anything to do with you, or the relationship you have with your sister. If you want to cut all ties with your sister/family, do so. But don’t pretend her being married to your cousin and “being disgusting” has anything to do with it.

You were a child and judging by the demand still are a child.

You have no idea about the intimate details of your mother's and your father's relationship. You dont know the full story and should not presume to know exactly who did what and why. You are butting in without knowing or understanding the full picture.

The fact that it was your mother that freaked out speaks volumes about how foolish your demand is. 

You are not owed an apology, if anything you owe your father and your mother a thank you for staying in what was clearly a failing unhappy relationship and working through those problems for the sake of the children. For the sake of you!

Be grateful you still have a united family instead of blindly picking at old scars."

brspfv,"NAH. 

Having a houseguest can make you feel like that sometimes.  Luckily it seems like he only has another week to deal with.  I think some of your concerns are valid (not chipping in for groceries or meals) and some is just your general annoyance at his presence.  Like wiggling into your friend circles?  I mean, it is his brother who he grew up with, and you guys are the only people he knows their (I'm assuming this).  Of course he will want to try to make friends through you.  Not doing chores without being prompted?  Some people are just like that.  If he does it when you ask, I'd say you should get over that.

Maybe you should separate out what the actual problems are and what the things are that you are just generally annoyed about, and you and your fiance talk to him.  Like, its perfectly fine to say ""For the next week you are here, we want you to chip in for groceries and do X chores around the house"""
brspib,"NTA, also chlamydia is a slap in the wrist lol. She’s dumb for not going immediately. All you do is take a pill, and it usually goes away after 3/4 days. It’s advised to stay away from sexual practices for a week just to be on the safer side."

This is a ""you're not wrong, you're just an asshole"" moment IMHO."
brt38e,"YTA. Not in the traditional sense, but you *are* enabling your wife's toxic behavior with this choice.

&#x200B;

To achieve the results your wife's doctor seems to believe she needs for the sake of her *life*, your wife needs her whole world to support her, and that means tough love, NOT enabling. Much like any other addict, to actually address this your wife will need to change much of the core of her being, the way she sees the world.

You need to be the avatar of that strength in resolve, not the vehicle for which she can shirk just enough to get the doctor off her back."
brt4oe,"It's a difficult one but I'm siding with YTA, though it depends a bit on the ages of everyone involved. Look, the issue is, you can't really ""ground"" her. It sucks that your parents aren't involved, but from what I gather here is that they're still your legal guardians, and you haven't taken over that role in an official capacity, right? Then simply said, you have no legal right to limit her movement. 

I know the next suggestion is probably not going to be popular, but I would suggest calling CPS if your parents are this uninvolved. You should not be taking over these responsibilities because I'm pretty sure you're a minor too. You guys need adult intervention in your lives."

That's a very low blow.

Definitely apologise and say you spoke off the cuff and weren't thinking properly about your choice of words."
brt9gc,"Edit: YTA because your parents are letting you live rent free and paying for your food under the impression that you’re in school and therefore have no time to make money. If you were in your own place, it might be different. 

If they’d be livid now for what you’re doing, what makes you think they’d be less livid after you’ve lied about it to them for three years? 

I don’t think you’re an asshole for choosing not to go to school, or even for choosing sex work, though it seems like it’s not the best long-term plan. I just think that saving yourself from the pain now will bite you in the ass later."

I'm REALLY concerned for your niece, and for you.  i hate to say it, but this sounds like it might be a case for CPS.  if the niece is neglected, and you can't mentally afford to keep battling for her, then it might be your responsibility to take the nuclear option.

brvb4p,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

My friend Jack was going to visit back for the first time since graduating together in May 2017. He informed me of this in July, and the weekend trip was centered around a music festival and the birthday of Jack's best female friend, Julia. Julia and I are acquaintances at best, and, to my surprise, I found out that weekend that I am on even worse terms with many of Julia's friends. So, what Jack did was offer to play golf with me on Monday after, and Jack would take an additional day of PTO from his job.

   
 

I had vocalized at this point that had a seasonal job with very little time off flexibility. It was not possible for me to get a day off from work. I asked Jack if he had time that weekend, to which Jack said he had already planned multiple events with Julia taking up the entire weekend before informing me of the trip's existence.

   
 

I begged my boss to get off work early on the Friday after the night Jack flew in, and texted Jack, and he agreed he could leave his girlfriend with Julia and her friends to see me. I then drove nearly 30 miles to go pick up Jack from where he was staying after he flew in. Jack and I went to a driving range, all in all spent about 2 hours together, and it was a very good time.

   
 

On the drive back from the range, I asked Jack to ask if I could come to dinner that evening as well to see a friend and meet Jack's new SO as we had hoped to arrange. This was Julia's birthday dinner, so he declined. Since Julia and I were not on good terms, I told Jack that I did not expect to be invited to that. But Jack initially refused to ask Julia if I could join him the next day, saying it was her plans and he had no authority over them, and said to ask Julia herself, his justification again being it was her birthday weekend. At which point, I asked Julia and she told me no because her friends were going to be there. I expected this result, which is why I asked Jack to voice his opinion as well, so we could spend time together. He said he did, and they laughed and asked why anyone would want me there. The same rationale was used to not ask to invite me to the festival Saturday or their Air BNB that Julia, Jack, and Julia’s friends were staying in.

   
 

However, in a compromise, Jack agreed to meet me at the music festival Sunday evening, which was already part of their plans. I purchased a ticket for that day only, and Jack and all had a pass for all weekend. The day before, Jack and I had made plans to get to the festival around 5-6 pm. On Sunday around 3 pm, Jack texted me saying they would not be there until around 9 pm for the final act since they made new plans. At this point, I would have been left alone at the festival for 6 hours until then, with no other mutual friends attending, as I showed up early around 3 pm. I left the festival around 6 pm and went home, and Jack & Julia did attend at 9 pm as promised. Jack then went straight from the festival to the airport to fly back home.

brvb98,NTA and why the would you let them in front of you? You were there first in my eyes. They can get their lazy asses out of their cars and stand there like you did otherwise get behind you in line. Stop letting them do that to you.
brvd3g,You're pretty much being a jerk.  YTA.  Help your mother.
brvfb3,NAH - assuming you were relatively close with your grandfather then that’s obviously a big shock to deal with and I think you’re right to be mad about it for the time being. However I don’t think there are any assholes in this whole situation. Your family most likely didn’t tell you to avoid worrying you which seems frustrating but may well have been for the best. Try not to let the fact this was kept from you annoy you too much but for the time being it’s ok to feel a bit cheated by them. I’m sorry for you’re loss and hope things get better

brvhr0,"NTA. If you have to pay to live there, he should too."
brvhxs,YTA this isn’t something to get angry about. You are far too immature to be in a relationship.
brvhzh,"NTA 

I really don’t know what to make of the situation, you should definitely try and see why she’s mad at you but no matter which way you slice you wouldn’t be the asshole. She’s the one who broke the agreement and started bringing the group apart, it’s only fair that if she’s gonna try and make them chose that you get to make your case as well. Best of luck dude, I hope y’all are able to work through it."
brvi0f,"NTA. She does all of this (unpunished or not) and expects to be rewarded with gifts? lol no. That said she’s 21. Let her figure it out herself. If she doesn’t want to apologize and deal with her behavioral problems, it’s probably too late for you to help her. Salvage what you can."
brvoy1,"NAH - from your title I was preparing to give you the obligatory YTA and an entitled jerk judgment, but reading the details I'm thinking maybe something is actually wrong here.  200 guests and only 35 of them gave a gift?  Even accounting for the fact that some of the 200 were couples, a few might have gone in on a group gift and some might feel they already gave at the shower, having less than 20% of the total guests give a gift sounds really off.  Is there a possibility some of the gifts or cards were stolen?  That's definitely something awful that happens if there's not a person dedicated to guarding the gift table at the reception."
brvpdx,"NTA. Struggling with a ""severe eating disorder"" is a totally understandable reason why you told her to stop comparing. 

I think it's ridiculous that she got upset about you setting a perfectly healthy boundary."
brvsr0,"NAH - You're feelings are definitely justified, but supporting your family is important and sure you might not care about her right now, but it sounds like there are other people in this scenario that could also use your help. It's not fun, but helping out people you love (maybe not your shitty sister in this case) is what mature people do when they are able to. 

Pull your shit together and you might be able to do some good in this scenario, for your sister, your family, and yourself."
brvv3o,"NTA, she's being really weird. Most couples don't shower together all the time. She should let you take your own dang shower!"
brvx0b,"NTA.

I think a lot of your issues here would be solved by moving out, if that's an option.

Your mother is completely capable of locking the door and putting up a 'back in 5min' sign if she needs the bathroom.

She also needs an employee, and if she can't afford that, or the shop isn't doing well, then she needs to rethink this idea. Especially if she's having issues with paperwork."
brvy53,"ESH.  You moving the flowers shouldn't have been a big deal if it was an allergy issue, and it sounds like your coworker overreacted.  But you might have gotten a better reaction if you'd said something instead of just moving the flowers.

brw3cq,"NAH

You’re allowed to be uncomfortable, and he’s allowed to be upset, and she’s allowed to be touchy feely. It is sad that it’s hurting their friendship though which leads into... 

It seems to me like you’re more jealous of her casual touching than you’re jealous of the implications. You come off as more upset that you can’t be that casual with him and him reciprocate than it is that she’s doing it. So what I’m saying next comes from that point, and if I’m off base then ignore me. 

What’s stopping you from giving your boyfriend shoulder kisses? What’s stopping you from messing with his hair? What’s stopping you from stroking his arm? Maybe if you were able to become more comfortable with casual touching it wouldn’t bother you so much."
brw3mg,"YTA and so are your mother's siblings. 

I mean, you're not obligated to meet them or like them, so I wouldn't say you're a major asshole. But it's pretty immature and a little asshole-ish. 

What's wrong with this lady that you all won't give her the time of day? The fuck did she ever do to you? She is technically blood, maybe family if you give her a chance but you'll never know unless you stop being assholes to her and her daughter.

What's so wrong about giving these new people a chance? Technically she is your half aunt, what's wrong with having an aunt? 

Would you prefer to not meet new people that might end up being important parts of your life?

Give her a chance, and her daughter. You know, something your grandpa never fuckin' did."

I get why she wants someone to check up on him, but it's totally understandable why you aren't comfortable being that person."
brw7xc,"NTA for wanting to end the friendship. But you should tell him that you don't want to be friends anymore, instead of ignoring him. I've been ghosted by a friend before. I think it hurt me more that he ghosted me than if he would have just told me he didn't want to see me. It still hurts so much to not know why. Did I do something wrong, or is he just too busy, or did his girlfriend ask him to stop talking to me? I still wonder about it a lot."
brw97w,"NTA, the dude is hurt and lashed out at you. He put himself on a stage and didn't like the criticism. Not your fault at all."

brwxbg,"YTA.

People aren't clothes you get to try on for a bit to decide whether they suit you or not. She clearly had feelings for you and you basically treated her as if she was just there to help you decide whether or not you're capable of being in love with another person."

You paid for the seat, so you do not have to give it to her. But she is a 12 year old girl that had to stand for 18 hours? I mean the mom isn’t wrong for asking, especially if all the sitting tickets were sold out."
brx30j,"NAH.  However, I think it you would be better off talking to your coworker yourself, especially if you are worried about getting him in trouble. Just gently remind him to be more mindful of your personal boundaries."
brx32t,NTA. Just tell her the situation.  No point in beating around the Bush. You're an adult and have adult issues. Just be honest.

And you definitely should communicate with him about something that's making you cry!"
brxc4b,"NAH - Clinical depression - which this sounds like it is - is an absolute fucker.  Brutal.  And can seem like someone is just not trying (I speak from bitter experience).  

Sleeping all day - I did that - because being asleep was a relief and respite from the utter misery (depression makes you more tired than you could imagine because your brain is going at 800 miles an hour to make you feel like shit any which way you cut it).  I also spent waking hours doing mindless things like video games.  I obviously didn't care about the outcome, it was the ability to detach and lose myself in something other than my own thoughts that was the most important thing.

Total defeat in the face of loved one's expectations - I did that -because I couldn't even bring myself to think more than 5 minutes ahead - never mind shower or make a plan to do anything.  I knew I *should* do x/y/z (*should* is the word most depressed people use to try to motivate themselves but end up using to bash themselves over the head) but could not summon the energy or brainpower to actually do them.  And then that feeds into your brain telling you you're shit because you failed.  Yay!

First of all - has your husband gone to the doctor.  That is the first step - he needs a proper diagnosis either way.  If he is clinically depressed (I use clinically, because I use it to indicate  a proper diagnosis which means your brain chemicals don't work rather than 'I feel a bit shit right now') then he needs to talk to his doctor about anti-depressants.  I see that you say you can't afford them, but can you afford *not* to have them?

A lot of people have a fear of anti-depressants - 'they're over prescribed, they don't work, you just need to get to the gym, they make you a zombie blah blah'.  No. What anti-depressants do for the clinically depressed is get everything back on an even keel.  They don't suddenly make you super happy.  What they do is even out the *crushing* lows so that you can start to make rational decisions again, and start to see the world as it really is.   It might take a while to find the right one, but once you do it's life changing.

Your life is unfair at the moment.  Supporting an unmedicated and deeply clinically depressed person utterly sucks.  What you already know is that no amount of cajoling, pep-talks or ultimatums will make his brain chemicals work differently so you know to dispense with all those options and look elsewhere.

Sadly one of the other side effects of depression is a distinct unwillingness for the brain to admit that there's anything wrong.  In my case it took a really good friend and my mom telling me that if I didn't go to the doctor then they would come round to my apartment and take me there themselves.  Turns out they were right.  I was in a seriously bad way. I kind of knew I was miserable but couldn't join the dots.

It sounds like you've joined the dots for your husband, so the ball is in your court either way.  You're not a bad person for being so sick of your life that you want to leave.  Turning things around takes a bit of work, kind of like an oil tanker - it may have a very large turning circle - and if you can't pay for medication then that's going to be even worse (fuck you US 'healthcare')

I hope some of what I've said might be useful and I genuinely wish you both all the very very best."
brxcb9,NTA. You as her mother have a right to control who you allow close to her. To anyone who is telling you you’re being too harsh; they don’t get a right to say so because THEY don’t know how you feel.

brxce8,"ESH. If you call the police and tell them you saw someone on their phone in the McDonalds drive thru, they're not going to do anything.

brxckk,"YTA, but sort of understandably. It's a lot, but it's rude to let someone reaching out like that dangle. It's obviously pretty late now, but you should have cut things off and been clear about being uncomfortable a long time ago.

Either find a place for it in your budget, or it's not an option. In the end, it is a luxury what you are asking for.

bs1qye,"NTA - I have a feeling that there will be a contingent of people who will argue ""her body her choice"".  And to some extent they're right. You shouldn't be able to dictate what she chooses to do to herself. That having been said, you made your position on tattoos clear from the beginning and she not only did the opposite, but didn't even talk to you about it first.  Not like she got a new hair style that if you didn't like would eventually change, the tattoo is permanent.  So, no, you're not the asshole for being mad. 

Now.... Having said that, consider the possibility that you might be an asshole for having requirements for how she maintains her body. Is it really a deal breaker for your relationship?  Aesthetics change over time.  Tastes change over time. Is a hand tattoo really the hill you want to die on?

Edited: to be more sensitive to how the term ""her body her choice"" is used. In its original context, it read like it was a trope used anytime a woman did something that a man didn't like.  It was intended to point out who quickly some redditors play that card for everything.  However, it's a serious and legitimate argument that I think should be reserved for more significant womens' issues -- reproductive health, not being sexually harassed/assaulted, etc.  When it's thrown around for trivial issues, it devalues the effectiveness of the argument."
bs1s4f,"YTA.  There is seemingly a lot of extra baggage with this decision and I concur with your GF’s sense about your BFF’s intentions.  Your GF gave you very clear reasons why she was upset, but frankly being told she can go and then have that yanked is reason enough to be pissed.  Should she have told you explicitly how she didn’t want you to go without her?  Absolutely.  But get this, you KNEW she’d be pissed, you saw she was... you should have had the nuts to man up and own the situation.

You should have stood up for her, you sent and are currently sending a very strong message that she is not as important as your own feelings/experiences.  

I hope for your sake she is waiting for you.  If a GF of mine pulled that kind of a move she’d be coming back single.

edit - PS - if you actually give a shit, most airlines will rebook a ticket for $75-100 assuming the cost of the fare is close.  Getting your ass home early and saying you f’ed up would be a first step to patching things up.   If you don’t give a shit that is totally up to you, but don’t pretend you don’t know what you did was an A-hole move."
bs1x7t,"YTA, you are a woman and so need a man to guide you in case you break a nail, encounter a minority or have a period on something. My man stands by me when I take the bins out because without his guidance I may mess up for I am a weak and silly girl."

It is not your job as a student to criticize your teacher. It is not your job to tell her how to do her job.

There is a structure in your school for dealing with these issues. You wish to follow it. Please do so.

Note: chances are that they won't fire her. If they do, it is because this is the straw that broke the camels back. Single offenses do not lose teachers their jobs. (In a decent school run by rational people.)"
bs2ljx,YWNBTA. Sometimes professors in college get the same kicks from doing this.

bs2t0v,"YTA if you're forcing her. You know what it's like at that age - the more someone tries to force you to do stuff, the more you'll resent them for it.

driving is a practical and useful skill to have and even if you don't drive often it's still good to know how to do it.

it was my own partner who pushed me to learn to drive. i didn't want to, had a million excuses (and valid reasons) why i shouldn't have to, but in the end i relented, gave it a shot, and now i am SO thankful for that push. it's not only independence but, as you said, has helped us in an emergency where he was unable to drive so i got us to the hospital. 

here's the thing though: driving lessons are EXPENSIVE and whether or not she HAS the money is irrelevant to whether or not she wants to (or should have to) spend it on this just because you want her to.

i would suggest the compromise of you teaching her."

Your husband has every reason to be angry. You undermined his authority as a dad. You acted unilaterally instead of as a team. You showed him no respect. Did you even tell him the compromise of 2 more days grounding and the location tracking as a condition of lunch?

* New Phones sometimes come with apps preloaded or in packages. Never heard of this happening with a dating app but it's possible. 
* Apps sometimes transfer from old phones (Apple does this especially, but Android can too). For all you know it's from before your time. 
* Someone once installed a dating app (not tinder, different one) and *made a fucking profile* on my phone after I left it at a friend's house. I was single at the time but it this post just reminded me of that incident...

I think both of them are NTA, but I've never seen such a blatant double standard. If a man moves on quickly, he just needs the comfort. If a woman moves on quickly, she's a shrew who never cared about her deceased partner.

  
EDIT: Fixed typo"
bs45ty,"YTA - they're right, if you're going to say something else is more interesting than them why are you even friends with them? Even if something else is more interesting though, they are your friends you should be engaged with them, find something you can talk about ask them their plans for the future or just random questions about things that interest you.

Maybe practice a bit of restraint, tell yourself that you won't be on the phone all the time when youre with them but you can check it every so often.

bs4gu8,"NTA. Sex should be had because all parties involved *want* to have it. You are not obligated to have sex or perform sexual favors on anyone, ever, for any reason. Yeah, it's nice. Sure, whatever. But that doesn't mean you have to do it, and it doesn't make you selfish for not doing it.

Your BF sounds like he feels entitled to you sexually whenever he wants it, because HIS feeling trump yours. I'm not saying break up or anything, but I hope you recognize this as a red flag, at least."
bs4lma,"NTA: You gave her full credit (on the post I'm guessing) for the inspiration. You may want to take it down just to stop her from complaining, but you don't have to.

Do what you want to do with your job, your time, and your life.  You don't owe a corporation anything beyond the hours you agree to work and the job you agree to do and you can withdraw your labor at any time.  That's the benefit of living in a free society.

Her QOL sucks, unfortunately she’s taking away time/money from other patients who can be saved, and the overall grieving process of losing her is being delayed for the whole family. 

That being said, it’s easier for us to say because we’re detached. Just keep doing what you’re doing, and be kind to them."

If you feel bad about it though, it wouldn't hurt to just be like ""hey sorry about that, what's the update?"" When you call them. Just saying sorry might make you feel better, not that I think you need to apologize"

bs68ga,"NTA. This is *your* family history, too, not just your dad’s. Your other family members are not justified in getting mad at you for sharing what you found, and if it’s stirred up a family feud, that’s not your fault. The fault lies with the people in your family who were dishonest with your dad all these years. 

I suppose it would have been more sensitive to ask your dad up front “Dad, if I find out anything more about your background, do you want me to tell you or would you prefer that I not bring it up?” But while it would have been more considerate to take that step, I wouldn’t say you were an asshole not to."
bs6a22,"YTA, for *sure*.
