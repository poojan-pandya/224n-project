bs8y5q,"NTA The Genocide in Arakan, Myanmar is a well known issue among Muslims, even in my country Turkey which is at the other side of the world. But I've never seen someone blaming Buddhism for the genocide, they usually put the blame on the Myanmar government instead."
bs95av,"ESH, holy fuck none of you should be signing any contracts. You should've demanded to see the house before even considering paying for anything. They strung you along and are trying to guilt you, and now you're fucking them over because you didn't bother to do any work yourself. It's all of your faults really. In the future, don't let anyone strong-arm you for money. It sounds like he's trying to fuck you over hard, don't let him."
bs97ij,"NTA and I'm going to warn you that vegan diets are very often not healthy for children that small and have in the past even killed them. I highly advise against doing that, as *you are risking your child's life*. On top of that you can't afford it.

Side note, file for child support. It's for the child, not for you."
bs9gcy,"NAH, but you should really be in some serious therapy if you aren't already. This isn't something you can deal with on your own."
bs9k78,"NTA. But treat this very gently, she sounds like the type to have an over-the-top reaction if you suddenly cut her off. I assume this year is almost over, ride it out until then and continue to eat with her. Next year you can branch off with your friends. However, recognize if she’s completely alone and upset. Yes, she’s sometimes mean, and Yes it’s annoying, but nobody deserves to be treated unkindly for being a little different."
bs9lha,"NAH. You think he's cute, it's a very random setup, no harm in going out on the date and seeing if you click. If you don't like him and keep dating him because he's rich, then you'd be a jerk."
bs9lir,"NAH. I'm sure your dad's family means well and just loves you and wants to spend time with you, but I would talk to them honestly about how you'd like to not miss any more school and perhaps not spend so many weekends with them."
bs9mo4,"YTA. Your friend specifically requested you didn't show people (yet). You did, after seemingly agreeing with his wishes. That's a dick move."
bs9nbt,"NAH - what dilemma?  If your friend is sick, why would it be a problem for you to go out and do your own thing?  He gets to rest quietly and you get to have fun.  Win/win."
bs9qii,"NTA 

Fuck cheaters. They cause pain to others for no reason. She deserves to know she’s carrying the baby of someone who doesn’t give a damn about her"
bs9ryg,"I'm gonna say NAH because you specified how you wanted the steak.

But you're creating a monster there, just so you know."
bs9tfd,"NTA. Your mom should have paid for the case and protector if she was going against the express wishes of your dad.

Your dad should have known that retail employees default to the judgment of the parent."
bs9vi6,"YTA. You could have harmed yourself, the person you pulled this idiot move on and/or others around you. What the fuck were you thinking?"
bs9zy0,"ESH

If I knew my SO had cheated on me, I'd personally dump her the second I found out.

If I had your calm, I'd totally do the same.

I believe it's a decent revenge to get, but still makes you an asshole, just like she is.

(Remember - It's okay to be an asshole sometimes)"
bsa0l1,She did one for her friend because it’s different than having one from a significant other- it’s permanent and if you guys break up then it’s on you forever. Totally makes sense.
bsa2ut,"NTA. Your friend is being creepy and needs to let go. If they truly loved this person, they would want them to be happy."
bsa6gf,[deleted]
bsa7bu,"NTA. It doesn't matter how long they've been married, someone deserves to know this kind of thing. Your mother is the asshole, and your father deserves to make the decision about whether or not he sticks around based entirely on the TRUTH. Also, he deserves to know you're not his biological spawn. I can assure you that it won't change his love for you, but it doesn't mean he doesn't deserve to know. 

Your mother is awful for this. I'm sorry to hear she'd put you in such a position."
bsacxg,"Think this through.  If I was your boss, I'd be understandably hurt.  This is kind of a gray area, so tread lightly. Nah."
bsadvd,"I'm going to go with YTA.  From what I've read, you pushed her to give you her opinion on a matter that she was not entirely comfortable with.  Then you we're passive aggressive, by your own account, because of that opinion.

Then you once again didn't respect her boundaries by trying to force a conversation about feelings.  She was well within her rights to kick you out if the car.  Imo she was even nice enough to bring you back to the dorm.

And while your apology may have been genuine, pushing for one in return does make it seem disingenuous."
bsai0k,"YTA. I get where you're coming from, but it really isn't your place as an acquaintance to offer unsolicited life advice on his choices, no matter how poorly thought out they may be.

There will be plenty of people who will give him this sort of feedback as he moves forward. You don't need to be one of them. Sometimes you've just got to let people do the dumb stuff they're gonna do."
bsaji1,"Yeah, YTA. Don't record people in private areas without their consent. Depending on the laws in your area, you might've even been doing illegal surveillance. Look up if you live in a state or country where you need two party consent. If you are, get a lawyer right now."
bsakth,"NTA. You two are growing apart from each other. She’s a toxic friend too. Breaking off friendships is always going to be difficult, especially if both of you have been friends for a long time. Learning to accept that friendships coming and going is a part of growing up. However, you will make many more beautiful friendships as time goes on."
bsal0m,"Yes, because sitting around while someone's in the hospital is totally going help their surgery go better.  
NTA."
bsal56,"I would just like you to know that your comment was reported as ""agenda pushing"" and I'm sitting here laughing my ass off."
bsalvj,"YTA
You weren't the 'secret boyfriend' you are the side dude. You KNEW she only wanted money, and you got sex in return. You maliciously decided to try and ruin her life, run her out of town. Do you want her to not ever have any friends because she didn't pay you enough attention?"
bsamt1,YTA if you give her too much grief about it.  Not all employers are great about time off.
bsao9x,"Do I really need to answer this question for you?

Your girlfriend is Bad News Bears."
bsas87,"YTA.

You're not doing him a favor by buying them back. He paid in full for those rings, and now that you're not getting married he's out all that money and you were out none of it. He can sell it for whatever price he wants.

Personally, if I was engaged to someone I wouldn't want rings from a previous engagement of theirs."
bsatjd,YTA. No one betrayed you. It isn't your business who anyone anywhere is having sex with aside from your own significant other. They were neither wrong for doing it or obligated to tell you. Choosing to lose a friendship over two people consensually having sex is really silly.
bsaxuv,">My wife has been almost begging to move to another state

>I think moving my family will ultimately be a good thing.

NTA

You have your answer"
bsb1jp,"YTA. Haha holy shit dude. Its one thing to dislike a manager its another to actively bad mouth someone. I dont care what your reasons are or if you feel justified, its never good to act like a vindictive 12 yr old especially as an adult. Have some tact. You can openly talk about your troubles in a fashion that doesnt belittle others. But from your post I feel like thats not the case.

Grow up. Either get a new job or find better words. But dont be knowingly hurtful behind someones back. Thats just rude."
bsb1v0,"NTA 
Your sister while she has issues is a professional manipulator. You need to have an open and honest conversation with your mom. Tell her calmly how you feel and state facts.  And try to get out as soon as you can.


Good luck"
bsb38b,"NTA, that's on them. Sidenote, that pizza had been standing out for a while."
bsb3ry,Mind your own business dude lol there's pretty much no likely scenario where this ends well unless he brings it up first. So yeah YWBTA here if you ask.
bsb500,"NAH? I think? Listen this is hard for me to pinpoint but it sounds like you fiancée is doing because she doesn’t want to strain her family ties further. Ok, makes sense. You want to have someone as your best man who you want to be. Ok, makes sense. As far as I can tell no one has been argumentative about so, talk it out. Figure out if there’s a way to make it work. I don’t think either of you are acting like an asshole."
bsb649,YTA - it costs you nothing to send the numbers and it means an extra step for them to contact her which would make it less likely to happen.  For your mother I think it would be good to make it easier for them to contact her.
bsbauw,"YTA. You don't have to like tattoos, you don't have to want tattoos, but she wanted it and you said yourself you were supportive of her getting one. You shouldn't have said you were supportive of her getting one if you knew you were going to ""cringe everytime you look at it.""

Edit: just to clarify, you're the asshole because you lied to her about how you truly felt about tattoos."
bsbd19,"ESH. You're both assholes, though I get where you're coming from. Just hire someone to pick up the shit from his dogs and then send him the bill. When he refuses to pay, sue him in small claims court. It will make him stop fast."
bsbd53,"NAH: This relationship has a high chance of not ending well for both parties. If his friends don’t like you they’re going to be whispering in his ear, and if he wants an SO that’s around more and you don’t oblige (or do go but are noticeably not having a good time) it will absolutely strain the relationship.

There are at least 3 relationships red flags in this post alone, good luck!"
bsbdpc,"ESH. Don’t want to take care of puppies, be a responsible pet owner and have your animals spayed and neutered. Way less expensive in the long run and prevents this entire situation. Or take the responsibility for your inaction and don’t let the animals you are responsible for die."
bsbdyu,"YTA.
Think this through for a minute. You have a friend, who loves you like a brother. He expresses that he missed you and loves you, so you tell him, a gay man that that was the, ""gayest shit ever.""

Do you not understand friendship?

EDIT: OP, stop calling everyone a liberal and accept your judgement."
bsbg23,"YTA. Your mom doesn’t get to see her side of the family that much and finally has a chance to invite everyone to come and visit and she can show you off. It’s common for high schoolers to think everything is about them. As a teenager I always rolled my eyes at that statement. Now I know I was just an immature asshole. The party is not at all about you, even though it’s for you. Suck it up for one weekend and make your mom happy"
bsbgzs,"ESH, you were not careful with her dog, if you would have had a better watch out, you would have noticed the glass. Sorry but when you have a dog you gotta keep watch out for such thing, even if you are just doing someone a favour. So to take some responsibility you should also pay for the bill as it would not have happened if you were more careful. However, ESH is because she is rude for going around saying you cut up her dog and being rude to you and assuming that you have to pay. She should have talked to you and asked if it was okay to pay half as she has not that kind of money and it would not have occurred if you didn’t let the dog walk in tall grass. You should (ofc) have in that moment acknowledge that you were at fault also."
bsbj30,"NTA, your mom is the one being unwilling to compromise. You should be able to celebrate with your family and with your friends, not be forced to pick one or the other."
bsbl26,YTA.  She doesn’t even go by that name. That’s the dumbest reason for breaking up I’ve ever heard.
bsbn6m,"YTA- he’s a sick kid. Get out a new bar of soap, clean the bathroom, and get over yourself. 

Also, sick kids will have a reduced capacity to regulate. He’s TEN, not thirty, and you’re interrupting him trying to do something when he feels like crap. Of course he’s going to have a fit. My god."
bsbs6n,"I feel like the root of the problem is being ignored: the source of the smell. Clean up the room and figure out what makes it smelly, and that should solve the issue for good."
bsbtv6,"YTA.

Privacy matters."
bsbxi2,"Holy shit. If this is real, then ESH.

It’s obvious why your mother is the asshole, your father less of one, but why the need to be petty? Just get your sister the bread, it’s a piece of fucking bread. You have some real dysfunctional family stuff going on."
bsbybo,YTA. Overly controlling. It's your body. You don't like tattoos don't get one.
bsc1cu,"NAH/ maybe a bit of your the asshole. The restaurant thing I think you're good on, Just personal taste. But with gifts, generally part of it is letting the giver watch to see your reaction. Yet, shouldn't the giver just want you to enjoy it? I see both sides on that one, but come down on no assholes here."
bsc273,"ESH. She's being a shit about a relationship she isn't involved in, and that was kinda out of nowhere to immediately go to that level (on that day, you mentioned this was building up, but ""snapping"" doesn't excuse it). 

Don't take this as a deserved vs undeserved thing, though."
bsc3pf,"NAH? I can understand you being turned off, but I can also understand her being bummed."
bsc4mq,"Just make sure those aren’t baby birds in that nest doing all the dirty work on your car. Otherwise, it won’t hurt the bird to take down the nest. They can rebuild one within a day."
bsc4rh,"NAH. Sounds like you and Rachel had a misunderstanding about the status of your relationship. No one really did anything wrong; shit happens and sometimes people have miscommunications. Now that it's been clarified, Rachel reserves the right to not want to continue an open relationship with you, just as you reserve the right to go on a date. All I would say is that people usually assume a relationship is exclusive unless stated otherwise to be an open one and that it might be better to communicate that in future relationships."
bsc74s,"YTA, from the way you described everything your only motivation was ""fuck that guy"" and ""it'll probably get me ahead"".  You didn't do this because you cared about your workplace and certainly not this guy."
bscbct,"NTA. They're adults, they should be able to tie a dog to the bench while they looked at their phone. Maybe a little entitlement by being upset at how hard it was to get the dog, but it's a living thing you love currnelty gone because they got distracted."
bscby4,"I’m gunna say NTA, but maybe that’s biased because I’ve been in a very similar situation. So I know how hurtful it is when you feel you’ve been thrown to the side like that. Yeah, maybe you inserted yourself a bit. But they also didn’t have to dismiss you like that. Friendships and relationships don’t have to be completely exclusive. You’re allowed to feel upset about that and need some distance."
bscdo6,EHS. - you knowingly cheated with your ex on her BF
bschcw,"NTA - he's a parent.  He can easily go to the schools website and check the date.  He can call the school.  And yea he can ask you... but regardless, it's on *him*.  It's not your fault your ex isn't keeping up with what's going on in your son's life, and it's not your responsibility either."
bschk9,"NTA telling someone your thoughts doesn't need to be such a big drama. They're obviously loving the drama and bullshit and feed off attention etc. 

If you two are so vastly different prob best to let the relationship fade and die."
bscjmh,"In case this isn’t trolling...

Oh my god, dude, do NOT do this. 

You may be well-meaning, but this is insanely cruel and fucked up. 

*His FIRST date experience will be a lie. 

*It is humiliating. He will DEFINITELY find out it was fake. 

*He may feel even more intimidated by women than before. 

Try to imagine if this happened to you. Like really picture it and think it through, I think you’ll agree with me."
bsck1k,"
You just spent an obscene amount of time explaining gym BS in depth when it could have been a simple short story. I get it. You love the gym and know all the fancy words and stuff. If you want her to love it too, be more gentle with teaching. Some people need to do it their own way without being forced.

YTA, because it seems like you are peacocking your gym knowledge on her and not really trying to teach and show her how to love it in her own way.

She's your wife. Not a dog you can yell orders at."
bsco3a,ESH. She should take more charge of her mental health and you should be more tactful. Feeling like a burden is why most people attempt suicide.
bsctn8,"YTA. If you honestly thought the kids were in danger, you should have called the cops immediately. You have waited until now, so either you already thought the kids were in danger and did nothing (which makes you an asshole) or you waited until now because you just want to be spiteful (which would also make you an asshole)."
bsctvo,ESH she's cheating but holy shit dude that was creepy as fuck skulking under a stairwell and watching from afar when she told you she was going to be out all day. Like a scene from You 😬
bscufd,"YTA you sound very annoying, I hate being around people like you in public."
bscxtn,"NTA but never, ever, ever, ever let it leak to anyone at all IRL 

This is a take-to-your-grave secret 

Enjoy those better-than-porn-because-you-know-her faps"
bscyvm,"ESH, you both need to grow up and communicate better with one another."
bsd1ti,"YTA. “Hey welcome home! I know your flight was super long & we haven’t seen each other in years, BUT can you ask your parents for some money to throw in on this birthday gift other people & I decided to get?” 

If I were in Ash’s it’d be a hard pass from me & I’d probably feel super pressured & awkward."
bsd8gm,"NAH, but there are a few yellow flags in terms of the relationship.

You really should’ve openly discussed this with your SO—this matter shouldn’t be too sensitive to discuss especially as she’s your intimate partner. I understand how embarrassing this can be, but, part of her role as a partner is to understand. I doubt she would mock you or take offense if you explained the matter. 

She shouldn’t have opened your package. You were both justified in being upset with each other, but it can all be resolved with open and honest communication."
bsdcbr,"NAH- This just feels like a lack of communication, people grow apart, but it's the type of thing that you should definitely bring up with her in person before unfriending her, best of luck OP congratulations on the marriage!"
bsdgdn,[deleted]
bsdh9v,"NTA

Saying I love you too much can lose the meaning and sincerity in my opinion. It just becomes an automatic response. How does he expect you to say it first when he's always saying it and bringing it up, not giving you a chance?

Edited a word"
bsdmhv,"At 20 years old, it's time to start transitioning to being able to have an adult-to-adult relationship with your mother.  It sounds like you're still a bit stuck in the teenager-to-adult mode.

You came home and realised that your mom was upset. An adult-to-adult thing to do would be to say, ""Hey, you seem upset. Want to talk about it?"""
bsdqqp,"I'd say it's your dad's problem, not yours. He shouldn't have bought a mansion he can barely afford, and he must pay for your braces. 

But make an account for yourself. It's important. 

NTA"
bsdsh5,"NAH leaning towards YTA

I get your feelings, but these are people who YOU are trying to make a first impression on. Getting all riled up isn't going to help anyone. Maybe they just wanted to see their girlfriends and not have an awkward interaction with a new partner. 

Suck it up, go meet the friends, don't mention the first meeting unless they bring it up, and play cool. Don't try to distance your wife from her friends either. Not cool"
bsdtcc,"The thing is, you have no idea who this person is, what their intentions are or even if they're alone. You could've stayed to make sure she was okay but I understand why you would be very wary. I've heard stories like this before..

NAH"
bsdutc,"I'm going to go with YTA, borderline NAH. You simply chose to ignore she got new glasses instead of acknowledging it. You could've said something like ""oh you got new glasses!"" but I see why you wouldn't either. You shouldn't be afraid to be honest with your SO either and if that means being brutally honest then so be it. You can always put it lightly to not hurt her too much but still get your message across."
bsdwex,"ESH.  The ladies were rude for taking their time, your friends were rude for cutting ahead. The bus wouldn't have left before everyone was on board, but people have places to be even if the older ladies aren't in a rush.  Plus the unnecessary comment about ""teenagers"" as though you're all some amorphous blob."
bsdwhd,YTA- you could sit on another smaller box or a bench.
bsdz3h,"NAH. You've got a right to be upset, and your in laws also have the right to decide where their money goes. You haven't acted on you emotions which just makes you a good person IMO. The only one I think has a chance of being the asshole is your wife, considering how smug she acted. What was up with that?"
bse9w9,"NTA

I’d stop talking about it though."
bsef36,"NTA, and since you're asking if you should leave the server I'd say yeah probably.

They matter, their feelings matter, but **you matter as well**.  You shouldn't have to acquiesce to *demands* to play with someone, you shouldn't have to be sprayed with salt about the other team when you're just trying to have fun, you shouldn't have to listen to people screaming at each other.  I wouldn't go calling people 'retarded' but it's understandable in the circumstances.

Also, sending someone pictures of self-harm is an incredibly fucked-up thing to do under any circumstances and if it's his server he could just kick you if he actually had such a problem with you.

Final point, it's not ""trying to sweep the situation under the carpet"" if you don't want to deal with this shit.  It's a massive assault on your own mental health and one you don't in any way deserve."
bseh0y,NTA. The last they could do is pay one more month. It's already a short delay to get out or a lease
bsekp3,"NTA but I’m not sure Suzy’s the BFF you should have. It’s all good that she’s a sociable person, but if you’re her BFF then carrying on seeing your exes (that most likely she only knows because of her friendship with you) is a little weird in my book. 

I’m not suggesting that Suzy needs to cut them dead, but she’s proper hanging out and having them in the same level of friendship as you. That ain’t right. Texting/calling is one thing, but this is a bit odd to me."
bselv1,Definitely NTA - but try to have a really open conversation with your mum about how visiting him makes you feel uncomfortable.
bsenne,"NTA

70 hours is a week is a lot and being able to recuperate every once in a while is important so you don't get burned out fast. and no, doing house chores instead of working at a job doesn't count as recuperating. it was wrong for her to expect you to do everything on those days. also, i'm curious what you do as a job that requires hours that are that intense op."
bsewch,"NTA 

First off, who gets high first thing in the morning?   I mean before noon?   Come on. 

Second of all, “his relationship” with mushrooms?  That’s a concerning statement. 

Biggest reason your bf is an asshole though is that he isn’t using this time to bond with his puppy.    But I’m a dog lover so I’m biased"
bseyot,"YTA for giving away games that you *share with your brother* without asking your brother. Also for giving away something and then asking for it back, without making it clear from the beginning. Call it a loan next time."
bsf64w,NTA. Imagine what the reaction would be if you didn't tell her and she found out later.
bsfab3,I have a general rule. If someone tells me to pick them or something else. It's almost always better to pick the something else.
bsfbq9,"ΥΤΑ. 

If you don't want kids, you shouldn't have kids. If you only want kids so you're not lonely, that's manipulative to say the least. Your kid or kids might not live with you after school/college/work, and many parents/kids learn to live separate from their family because of that. When and if your wife dies, your kids will have no obligation to keep you company, especially if they do not live near you. 

Seeing how my grandad is doing exactly this with my dad, I can't justify having kids just so that you're not alone later on. Doing this to your child could get them miserable, your kids will most probably be having their own life by that point, and if you don't really want them anyway, you have to make do if and when you're left alone."
bsfdhs,NTA - and I agree he could absolutely have told you sooner.
bsfknz,"NTA

Idc how depressed your friend is, blackmailing someone close to you with your well being is extremely low.  However, I wouldn’t just leave first.  If she doesn’t go already, I would say try to get her some therapy; she clearly needs some help."

bsfo8t,"NTA — The girl who was upset was still an adult who should’ve taken responsibility for her actions and paid for the drink. And if she wouldn’t, the friends should have."
bsfuk8,[removed]
bsfwo8,"ESH. You were an asshole, but a completely justified one in my eyes. Sometimes, to make people grow, you need to be an asshole.

> My whole family is blowing up my phone because I “ruined her birthday”. 

I wonder why she's so terrible when they're so afraid to punish shitty behavior, and instead feel like they should reward it."
bsfx5w,"NTA. This feels like one of those ""little white lies"" that are *technically* unethical, but not a great deal, and in a way that is ultimately harmless."
bsfzrf,"NTA

I would be mortified if someone accidentally bought an expensive gift for me that I couldn’t use and definitely wouldn’t joke around about it. 

Also, if everything is as you described it, then your brother raising his voice and personally insulting you is not a fair reaction to your statement, even if he disagrees with you."
bsg1kc,YTA “Paying” someone back by using their referral code is not paying them back.  Especially since you later benefitted from it by referring your own friends. You owe her $3.
bsg2em,"ESH. Your husband's financial issues are going to cause huge issues for you unless they are resolved but it is absolutely unacceptable for you to make a decision like this on his behalf. The consequences of this are also huge. It doesn't seem as though you are particularly struggling at the moment so this seems like a terrible idea all around.  
  
Really the issue that needs to be resolved is your husbands issue with finances which it seems you are aware of but forcing him down this path will fix nothing."
bsg96j,"YTA if you call him out. You have been very generous to him, but that was your choice. If you aren't happy with how is is acting, then choose to stop giving him money. But to call him out publicly would be a dick move."
bsg9gw,"I don’t have a judgement because this is a fucking mess. I think you have to be very careful with this situation, just because your ex lied about you does not mean she is lying about this man. You say he’s not an abuser yet you admit he’s a serial cheater and also you don’t know him very well anymore. If you warn him of this, and he ÎS guilty, you could be seriously putting your friend in danger. Just remember that not everything is what it seems."
bsgewg,"YTA. Definitely. 
  
It seems as though they were incredibly helpful to you. 3 hours is nothing, they also used their money on their car when they drove you around all the time.

They didn't even just ask to use your car they just said if you want to come they want to use your car."
bsghzu,"ESH. It doesn’t sound unreasonable that you didn’t get a ring based on his prior comments. But, if it’s that important to him, you should consider it now. 

He’s TA too though for his reaction. He could’ve expressed his desire for a ring in a better, more mature way."
bsgqc2,"NTA. This person is continually going against your wishes, interrupting you both in and out of class, and is acting disrespectfully towards others around you. That is not something you have to tolerate. You are allowed to put your foot down against shitty behavior. Besides, it's not like you're screaming at him or anything. You are firmly asking him to cease his obnoxious behavior."
bsgwvo,"NAH. I wouldn’t go to hospital visits, but if you can attend funerals that would be a nice thing to do for your parents."
bsgxoq,"YTA for the formatting.

bsgywl,"NAH. It's your shared space and if she prefers being in the room, that's fine. Also it would be unreasonable for her to have to vacate the room every day for a couple hours while you sleep. That being said, you also have a right to nap when you like.

I would suggest investing in some earplugs or a white noise machine. It would be a nice compromise so you guys don't have to worry about noise as she doesn't seem to be doing it on purpose, just making less of an effort. That should sort it out before things get argumentative."
bsgzm9,"NAH. Smokers actually don't think they smell bad. I quit about 2 years ago, and I'm shocked at how much my sense of smell and taste have changed. I actually didn't realize how strong cigarettes and weed smelled until I stopped smoking both. 

You are allowed to have boundaries when it comes to her smoking. 

I don't know how this worked; but both my husband and I knew we'd make fun of eachother if we started smoking again and that lead to us both quitting cold turkey. We didn't want to be the first to break; and we agreed to truces if we both had hard cravings while out drinking or something. It might not have been the ""best"" approach, but it worked."

bshe42,"Simultaneously YTA and NAH. Totally feels like a teen drama show from CW right now.

I'm going to agree with some of the commenters that YTA for not talking to your bf about not hiding this from his twin sister, aka your best friend. Dick move. He's the a****** here too. Put the shoes on the other feet and I'd feel pretty uncomfortable and upset if my best friend got together with my sibling and didn't tell me.

That being said... coming out is hard and complicated. Really complicated sometimes. I can understand not wanting to come out, so I think that you did the right thing by not outing him. Closeted people are difficult to date because every one is forced to lie... it would be an easy answer to say that they're the problem... but really, they are scared. And that fear is real. 

It can be really difficult to come out. And it's not easy to say hey I'll date you when you are... 

Because sometimes it takes having someone supportive to do it. Without that support... I've known people to go deeper.

If this is a fling and you know it's not going to last there's no doubt YTA, but if you think this is more... I don't blame you. 

Definitely apologize to your bestie. YTA for keeping this from her, even though there wasn't much you could do if you wanted the relationship."
bsheyt,"YTA. 

I just looked through your post history and saw a post you made 2 months ago in regards to your ex and his new girlfriend.  

You broke up with him first because of his mental illness and you decided to give it another chance after  he got help. 
Your ED got bad and he broke up with you.  
He broke up with you for a shitty reason, but you said you two decided to remain friends. 
Which you said you  resented him for. 

Him being mentally ill and depressed is not an excuse if he was emotionally abusive to you. 

 You said that you drunk texted him and blocked him on social media and he said you were crazy.
Then when you went back home you saw him at a mutual friends party and got jealous of his new gf. 

Do you have proof that he's sexually fetishizing young girls? 
I think a 3 year age gap isnt bad, but considering hes 19 and she is 16 it is bad because of possible maturity differences.
It also might be legal considering where you live.
  
If you knew this supposed information about him sexually fetishizing young girls, why did you wait 2 years to want to throw it out there? 
Was it okay when you were dating him or is it just convenient for you tell his new girlfriend?


Edit: Because you deleted the post I was referring to.

bshmjx,"ESH - your friend should be able to recognize his own wife's behavior is a problem, put two and two together as to why you're avoiding them, and talk to her about it.  I realize this is easier said than done, but being an insufferable one-upper and getting handsy with people who aren't your spouse are not exactly subtle failures in normal social circles.  He gets some blame here too.

For your part, since the wife's behavior is so egregious, you should not  be having so much trouble coming up with SOMETHING to say about the situation.  ""Hey, your wife was getting a bit kooky last night eh?"" Just something.  It's not rocket science. Gently tell him his wife is making it difficult for you to spend time together in certain contexts. Politely pointing out insane behavior is not too much to ask of a grown man.

You should be aware that every insurance policy has a clause stating that if you're vehicle gets into an accident you must notify your insurance carrier immediately or they could refuse to pay, so by keeping it a secret from your friend you could have actually caused her even greater trouble than if you had just been upfront about what happened. I imagine that's what she means by it having an impact on her future. 

In any event, the matter is taken care of now so there really should be no need for you to hold a grudge - if anything, your friend has more of a right to hold you further responsible for being so careless."

NAH. Yeah, babies cry, and yeah, that might be difficult for the parents, but that doesn't mean you have to put up with it. Good on you for talking to the mother; she seemed understanding. It sounds like they're using the method where they just let the baby cry it out, but they could still move it to another room like the mother said she would. They live in an apartment just like you do; people telling you this and that you gotta put up with the noise aren't considering that *they* live in an apartment too. They have to be aware of their neighbours, and their ""let it cry"" method isn't the best in this environment. Might be working (somewhat), but they can still move the kid to another room, since they know it's keeping you up.

Your friend is perpetuating societal sexism while being a sexist person. His jokes are immature, inappropriate, and they serve as a reminder of continuing historical sexism.

Why the hell wouldn't you, idk, send a text asking a friend **privately** whether or not they knew about his past and asking if they had any confirmation, before going full ""tumblr callout post"" mode?"
bsofhs,NTA. Your wife should really be backing you up. You’ve had no notice that they were coming and you won’t even be there for the bulk of their visit. Fuck them.

bsoh0h,NTA. That being said...why don’t you just take the products to appease your mom and then give them away for free or throw them in the trash? Ending a relationship over this seems unnecessary.
bsol8d,"I think in this instance, ESH. From the sounds of it, she ghosted you without explanation. Okay, that's mean and immature.

But.... come on, dude. Inaction at this point *is* action. You've made repeated attempts to figure things out and spend time with her, and each time she either brushes you off or tells you no. It's beyond time to let it go. You should not have taken things public (wtf???) and posted on Instagram. It's beyond time to leave her alone- surely there's a logical part of your brain that can see your repeated attempts to get her attention aren't wanted and taking things so publicly was trashy."
bsont8,NTA.  A child that disabled should be receiving social security money from your deceased wife and so should his guardian.  This can be a substantial sum of money.  Much more than several thousands of dollars per year.  I think your in-laws are taking advantage of you.
bsoqdk,"YTA. Leaving a check for a significant amount of money in your car when you KNOW that break-ins are common in your area is totally irresponsible. You have now inconvenienced those around you by creating more work for the parents, as they'll have to call and put a stop on the check, ensure that their funds are in order, and write you an entirely new check. It really just makes you look bad, man. I get that these things happen, it's part of life, but I hope you learn your lesson from it. Don't leave valuables laying around!

&#x200B;

You should look into switching banks. It's pretty easy. There are also different online services that make it more convenient to swap over all of your automatic billing info, I just can't remember them off the top of my head.

Regardless of your opinions on undocumented immigrants, from a family standpoint, it seems really unfair that your wife would deal a huge blow to your father's business for no reason."
bsp3pu,I know I’m going to be downvoted here for going against the grain but I would say NTA. If you’re in a relationship with someone you’re allowed to express what makes you uncomfortable. And as your boyfriend he should attempt to respect your feelings. His comment to you sounded like he didn’t care how you felt. If you aren’t comfortable with something and continue to not be comfortable but your significant other refuses to acknowledge your discomfort you need to re-evaluate your relationship.
bsp69d,NTA - Firstly I wanna say that I hope you hang in there! Family situations are tough and I empathize with how you feel and how your family makes you feel. It seems to me that your gf is an angel who has been there for you when your family wasn’t and I can see why she’s so important to you. But you’re young and having that kind of dependency on a significant other won’t be healthy for you in the long run! You need to be mentally strong enough for yourself and on your own in order to establish healthy relationships for the rest of your life. I highly suggest you seek therapy because from my experience therapy has changed my life for the better and I think it will help you with coping too.
bsp72v,"YTA

You aren't Maury. You have no idea whether or not this child is his. And honestly, this sounds less like you're doing this out genuine concern and love, and more motivated by the fact that you disagree with your ""friend's"" lifestyle choices."
bsp8kt,"NTA.

If you're not ready to forgive him, no one should force you to.

It doesn't even have to be abuse.  If a friend lies to you, betrays you, or steals from you... you don't have to FORCE yourself to forgive someone just because a certain amount of time has passed.  You might NEVER forgive him, who knows?  AND THAT IS OKAY.  

Your feelings are valid.  Do what is best for your mental health.

Take care."

There's something wrong when a 7 year old is being spoon-fed and has no firm motivation to eat on their own volition. 

Your mother should get her seen by a specialist, if she hasn't already. If your sister has some developmental issues - she needs a home carer who is trained for this situation. Not you.

At some point you need to care about your own well-being over someone else's. If your brother has been and still is making your life hell, then you're not an asshole. He may have mental health issues, but your brother is a functioning adult and should be responsible for his actions."
bsqeqb,"NTA. 

Having worked in a restaurant, I'd assume someone dropped something (literally), and they were waiting to have the replacement item finish cooking before serving you. Guaranteed your steak wouldn't have been rare anyway, which would've meant sending it back, which would've meant an even longer wait. 

Staggeringly stupid decision. They had an open passbar and got caught with their pants down. They should've just served the partial and comped, but that's their business."
bsqf32,"NTA. I think your argument is valid. You both should be able to have things you do together and things you do separately. 

Can I ask, is the reason she wants to join a trust thing or she just wants to join just because?"
bsqfll,"YTA.

>I'm also really pissed off at his response to any attempts to help.

He told you he didn't want help or advice. A lot of the time, when people share their problems, they want sympathy for the existence of the problem, and solving it is something they'll tackle by themselves. General rule of thumb is to ask if people want to vent or brainstorm when they come to you with a problem. But this is worse; he said he didn't want advice and you continued a behavior he asked you not to do. It sounds like he's right that you're not listening to him.

If having these conversations drains you, you'd be perfectly within your rights to take a step back and spend less time with him. But offering advice he doesn't want (and clearly isn't taking anyway, so why bother) isn't helpful for anyone."

bsqx5m,"NTA.          
You’re correct; it’s too much to put on a single person. If someone at work was expected to carry an entire project, and deal with a micromanaging supervisor, we’d have sympathy. If half of a romantic couple was expected to be the singular source of the other half’s happiness (day a guy couldn’t hang out with his friends alone, ever, because his girlfriend needed constant attention), we’d have sympathy. Your situation is no different, except it’s potentially even more emotionally draining due to your familial relationship.

I might be projecting, but I was in a similar situation with my own mother, and it prompted me to eventually put distance between the two of us for a number of years. In the end, she became a lot more independent, and I learned how to define myself as an individual beyond her therapist, but I won’t lie; it was really rough for a while. You may have to do the same thing here. Good luck."

bssxpk,"NTA if there’s a couple in a shared house I have always expected that they pay slightly more.

500 for their rooms is reasonable now that they’re sharing. 

My rational for this has been that a new person added to the house (or two in this case) also inconveniences you in various ways - more cleaning, less storage, the house is more crowded etc, so your rent should be slightly lowered to account for that. Equally, for the couples, they get the benefit of a largely reduced rent each, so you’re happy and they’re happy. 

That said I don’t envy your position OP. They really should pay a bit more in my opinion but getting them to agree could be tough.."

You should always ask before eating someone else's food and I don't think it's unfair for her to ask you to pay her back.

But mess is a habit that you get used to and it isn't seen as an issue by the person making it. But it's also no way to live. Another issue is kids are messy and most people with kids have messy places. 

It's just a decision on what's more important to you ultimately. Him, or a clean place. He can always get into the habit of cleaning, but once it's over getting back together is just another journey. Or you find someone new."

A more general chat saying ""you didn't seem to be in the best spirits, anything preying on your mind etc."" would be more valuable."
bsy8an,"NTA and he’s a textbook narcissist. He is not giving you what you need; a healthy relationship with open communication. There are too many red flags even in this one situation. I feel you need to stop and evaluate your relationship to this man and decide if you really love him and if he really loves you. 

If you don’t live with him, you should not be paying his rent. 

If you make the drive to see him, he should too. 

If you cook, he should too. 

You have a life, one that may have different stresses than his, but stresses nonetheless. He should be making the same effort you are."
bsy8qq,$25 is a lot for a person with no real job though who only gets spending money occasionally. If the sister didn't want to pay for it she shouldn't have asked for it.
bsyf7h,Your ex is a real asshole but what is taking a variety of men to pick up your son really going to do? ESH. Don't stoop to his level.

bsywqr,YTA but you were an immature teen. Hopefully you wouldn’t do that today. Your actions didn’t hurt anyone but did give you a reward you didn’t deserve and others worked for. How about manning up and doing 4 hours of service now?
bsz2z2,NTA: You as a parent want  your child to be happy. You don’t want your MIL to enforce discrimination that may influence your child and I can respect that.
bsz3gn,"NTA - you don’t have any obligation to help your neighbor / coworker out especially when you guys have different schedules. BUT, if you guys happen to be leaving work at the same time and you know you’re going home, offer them a ride every now and then. Who knows, you guys could turn out to be friends."
bsz5t3,"YTA. I get it those pride festivals are a lot of fun, but the usually happen every year yes? And there happen all over. You can miss this one and still get to one in the near future. You’re friend can still go and meet people and have a great time, they don’t need you there. You haven’t seen your family in a very long time and these reunions don’t happen every year. And this is a chance to show them the real you now that you have transitioned and to be proud of who you are in front of them. Plus, you never know what other family might be struggling with something similar, and seeing you there might help them be open and true to themselves (something similar happened to my friend when she came out to her family, it empowered her niece to do the same). And it’s family, to me that’s pretty important. Anyways, no judgements but sometimes we have to do things for others, not just ourselves."
bsz8c1,"YTA unfortunately.  You should have been a bit more gentle with them, or at least asked their parents if they could take them out so you could change/sleep.  That said, it does sound like a strange situation, surely the parents should be putting a 2 year old to bed by 11 pm and be popping in to see if the guests are ok."
bszcyu,"NTA but your parents definitely are jerky & ungrateful assholes - you're pretty the much parent, not the babysitter, to your younger siblings."
bszihm,"YTA for raging on company equipment. That being said, keep your mouth shut lol."
bszkkf,"NTA, you told the truth and if it hurts her reputation that bad so be it."
bszkn3,YTA If you're approaching from behind and they can't hear or see you then you need to shout something like 'runner coming through' . I do this when cycling. It's not my right to keep the same speed and expect people to get out the way. They don't have rear view mirrors
bszpp2,"YTA. And your BF is too. Unless this young man has done something wrong, he should be welcome in his old home. He’s got no mom. It’s only been a year. You moved a man in less that’s year after his dad died?  He’s grieving. Geesh!"
bszptv,"NTA - When your dogs get riled up, they bark, and it bugs everyone (except the kids of course).  I think the barrier is a good compromise for your situation since kids sometimes can’t be reasoned with."
bszqet,Your grandma wants to leave her stuff to you and she trusts you to take care of them. The rest or your family needs to suck it up and respect her wishes. NTA

bszsp8,NAH - I think all of your reasons for calling “dibs” sound completely valid.  You get my vote!
bszvf3,NTA but I really really think they should get their own place if possible and that you should try to find another couple to move in.
bszzq8,"NTA

Compensation to make sure you are okay is part of the business. As long as you're not taking advantage or trying for money just to get money, that doesn't make you an asshole. Sounds like your brother is being a bit of one by not hearing out your position and instead leaning so heavily on your dad's comment."

bt04b5,"The dad can make his choice, OP doesn't have to agree and go along with it. Just because the father wants to enable his daughter doesn't mean the son/brother needs to go out of his way to do things for her.

bt0aqh,"NTA. Your daughter won’t remember this summer. But she’ll benefit much more if your plan works out, which I really hope it does. Good luck. It’s such a tough choice but you’re really trying to do what’s best for her. You’re a great mother."

Ditch the weirdo friend and keep trucking along. I think that you two mutually being in agreement about sex at this age is awesome and mature. Keep doing you."
bt1dql,NTA. He should get a different job if that's the case. Scammers take advantage of people on a daily basis.
bt1e19,"YTA for not figuring out that ""scolding"" isn't enough in this case:

>calling him fat and stupid on the daily. I scold him and tell him not to talk to his own brother that way but he doesn’t listen.

You need to impose MUCH harsher punishments."
bt1eeq,Capri Suns are what? Like 5oz? Two seconds max. Rookies. Gotta open the throat.
bt1gtt,"NTA because your siblings are already adults. You can choose to form whatever relationship you want with your adult siblings. 

If you don’t like who your brother has turned into, and would rather not give him expensive gifts, then you are in no way obligated to. It’s ridiculous to expect equal gifts in this case. They’re not 5 year olds."
bt1iel,"NTA - she should have made it clear she expected you to pay for the hotel room from the start. it doesn't make any sense for her to offer to pay for it using her work thing, book really nice expensive rooms as well as then telling you that you owe her dinner only for her to then demand money for the hotel. Everything before her asking for money sounded like she was being nice and doing you a favour. If she wanted money for it she should have asked at the time she was booking it. 

Personally id give her the 200 just because of the hassle and ruining a friendship over it but you're definitely NTA"
bt1kl0,"NTA, your safety and well-being FAR outweigh any inconveniences your managers would have if you quit."
bt1oib,"YTA

Not for calling it off, but for calling it off half an hour *after* you would have had to have left to make it there on time.  You knew that you weren't going to go, but made it seem like telling *her* that you weren't going to go was little more than an afterthought to you."
bt1qcw,"NAH, if it was posted on FB it is absolutely ok to go."
bt1vj1,"NTA. Setting traps like she did is an asshole move. 

As a side note, maybe do something nice for her instead of spending money. Get up with the toddler and let her sleep in or cook or clean the house (if those are something she normally does)."
bt1vxs,[deleted]
bt20lt,"ESH. She should’ve communicated better, but you should’ve been more prepared. When you realized she wasn’t really living in the apartment and wasn’t planning on staying, you could’ve asked her to take her things then and brought your own."
bt2248,"Nah. Ive been there. But while i was working 14+ hrs a day i still did housework. I just didnt do the kitchen. You twonshould work out a schedule or chore list and he should by no means be off of that list. Contributing money only to the household is a great way to show your uninterested. That being said i remember coming home to have to cook dinner and having to do dishes before hand and that infuriated me to no end. Communicate with each other and remember to say i feel as though or sometimes i feel such and such, its non-accusatory  and will minimize chances of hurt feelings. Sounds stupid but it does help."

People can't control where leaves land - wind blows them wherever the wind wants to blow them.

My MiL (and FiL) used to sweep up leaves and dump them in the neighbour's garden because they weren't from their own trees. They spent so much time moaning about it that, each autumn, those leaves became a part of their psyche.

Just deal with them and move on. Have you thought of composting the leaves? The rest of your garden would benefit from this."
bt24ak,NTA. What the fuck else are you supposed to call them? They need to just be forthcoming with it. You can’t assume accurately 100% of the time based on appearance.
bt2551,"NTA and a simple explanation will suffice.

""Hey guys, I have a drug test coming up for this big construction job I really want, so I can't hang out if ya'll are smoking. I'll hit you up after it's over.""

If they freak out about that, they're assholes. Good luck with the job!"
bt25xi,"Slightly YTA.

>I’m right for not wanting to be in a friendship where the other person wouldn’t be there for me if I needed them

A ride to work wasn't a life or death situation for you. You're in the wrong for bailing on her birthday without notice and for holding a grudge for so long. Lighten up."

bt2apb,This is above this subs paygrade. This is a very hard topic and it really isn't something to categorize as asshole or not.
bt2df7,YTA stay out of your wives friendship and if she said sorry Friend know you're doing all this to be in my wedding but can't bring your SO that would rightfully cause a giant rift.
bt2ewe,NTA what is she 4? Set an alarm and get up or just don't agree to plans that early if you don't wanna get up early which 9 isn't even early to begin with.

bt2lq5,Yeah one more year until it’s child abuse to beat his ass. OP should savour all the time she has left
bt2qtd,NTA. But I think your husband kind of is the asshole for not absolutely setting his parents straight that the two of you live differently than they do and they need to respect that.
bt2s7w,"NTA. Damn this post took me back. I haven't thought about what that felt like in years. It fuckin sucks being the oldest sometimes. This is part of it. And no, it's not fair. Your mom just wanted to go to bed and for them to be done and she knew your sister would take foreeever to do them but she was so tired she didn't care"

Oh goodness, please dump him yesterday, he sounds like so much work."
bt2sw1,"YTA you asked she declined, and gave you a reason, not that she owed you one, and you kept pushing and harping until she snapped."
bt2twn,NTA. He seems to be a real jerk about it.
bt2vvy,"NTA - I greatly dislike Sprouts myself, but honestly it sounds like you roll up your sleeves a lot and are more accomodating than your roommates. The smell of Sprouts is a fair trade for cleaning up all of their shit left behind in the kitchen."
bt2wgx,"I think YTA, depending on the conversation with your BIL. It was your sister's table so he didn't really have a right to give it away, and you should have checked to make sure your sister was okay with it and had been consulted."

bt3gtv,"Being a big fan of college-esque parties, NTA.

When I was in college, we had a house in a neighborhood that wasn't college students. We made it a point that when we partied, it was not to disturb others. We had music, people being too drunk, but we contained it and handled it within the house.

You didn't sign up for it, and the ordinances are there for everyone to see. Follow the rules or there are consequences."
bt3gze,"YTA. This is...so petty. I mean, you get to invite who you want.

Your sister *is* going through a lot and while her behavior is out of line, I can't imagine being a young teen with all of that. You weren't malicious in your actions and I don't think she was either. It just sounds like a tough time overall.

You’re an adult, who has adult relationships. Most of these relationships will be other busy adults. I haven’t spoken to a few of my good friends for a while but they’re still my good friends. 

You should have spoken to her and asked her how she is going instead of just removing her thinking she is just doing it on purpose. 

I upload all the time and not reply to people because i don’t feel like talking to them. You can be acquaintances and have each other on social media. She was obviously upset you removed her."
bt4y1r,"NTA, but 95% chance it will go badly.  You may end up being let go (for creating drama).

The alcohol isn't healthy and I'm not saying it is, but it's currently how she's coping. I'm not sure if being called on it was good or bad for her. It's ultimately a bandaid fix and it's hiding more but that's something she has to come to terms with herself.

I'm not sure how you're going through the grieving process, but being around the bottles is not helping. You have absolutely 100% every right to protect your mental health (even if it pisses people off) and if she's a good friend, she'll understand that.

Do what's good and healthy for your wellbeing and if people can't handle that wish them the best and be on your way."
bt5i51,"Rubbish! Art is a huge and very employable industry! Without art you have no architects, books, newspapers, films, clothes, freaking almost everything involves an artist at some stage. You can go into graphic design, cgi, illustration, model making (that can earn a fortune!) animation, product design, website design (also super lucrative!) concept art, story boarding, publishing, editing, music, sculpting, photography, fashion, teaching, freelance, full time ANYTHING. In the words of Jim Carry, (paraphrased) you can easily fail at doing something you hate, so take the chance a go for what you love. It took me a lot of time, but at 30 I now design merch for Harry Potter, Star Wars, Marvel, Disney etc. All because of my art degree. Doing science is no guarantee of a job. It’s all about putting in the effort. Life goes in crazy directions, even if you end up just doing art on the side for fun and get an office job that pays the bills, it’s still amazing and worth while.

How far away is you aunt? Is there a place you can drive to to have dinner and meet halfway ?

I can understand wanting to do your own thing, but you can't keep someone from doing something they want to do when it doesn't directly harm others.  You can be upset with your sister for doing it, especially since you made your feelings clear, but it's not right to try and stop her from doing it.  Her doing the run doesn't take away how you do in it.  You're going to be the one who puts in the work to get in shape, you're going to be the one pushing through the pain you feel from running to earn more money, you're going to be the one giving it your all.

I think what should have happened is that she should have revealed to the group (including you) that she'd seen the card (doesn't have to say what it is), and asked what the group would like to do.  Given that your secret objective was the traitor, it's pretty game breaking.  Probably best to start the game over, or take back the objectives (I assume they're random cards?) and redraw them.

I'm gonna go with NTA because doing that makes the game pretty un-fun for you."

I don’t understand the last part though. Your dad said he would look into it and you got worried. Look into what? The pipe? Why is that worrying you? 

Also something I just thought of. Could be the plumber wanted to put cameras up while you were out. Stranger things have happened."

If he's making huge messes or the noise is somehow disturbing you, then that's a problem too.

Blah blah mobile blah blah formatting

TL:DR Told my family I didn't want to go out to a bingo several times throughout the week, on the day of they call me an asshole for not wanting to be with them

My mom and pops are in their late 40s early 50s and today we were meant to go to a bingo in Mexico (we live in a border city) I have told them all week I didn't want to go because I had work to do for school and I was exhausted. On Friday I participated in a school event (we won) and I had to carry my team for most of the events due to being the biggest guy there. I got hone exhausted and woke up sore as hell. The next day my mom sent my dad and I to pickup a couple of sofas to replace the ones we have.

I was exhausted by the end of this and ended up sleeping at about 1 am because we spent that night figuring out how to get this huge sofa into a small trailer. After showering and getting dressed in the morning in comfortable clothes my mom yelled at me to change into nice clothes. I told her I didn't want to go and reminded her I had been telling her all week and was exhausted from doing her bidding. She yelled at me and dragged my tired father and little sister out and into the car. She told me she and my dad were getting old and we were running out of chances to be together. She kept trying to guilt me into going but I have two essays worth 20% of my final grade each due on Tuesday and I had to work on them. I ended up staying home and my parents left with my sister.

My mom's comments left me thinking if I really am the asshole for staying home and not spending time with my parents.

For those of you thinking I don't spend time with my family I spend all weekend with them and go to parties with them whenever there is one. I'm not a shut-in but I do like my privacy. I often put them before my own life but this time I had to set my foot down for my own well being. My body still hurts and I'm currently working on my essays.

btbehz,"NTA, if they get back together and you tell him."
btbgaw,yta - it is not normal and is quite rude to just leave someone like that.   didnt your mama teach you manners?
btbx3x,What?
btbzaw,YTA.  You’re not her friend. You cheated. You kept in touch with the woman you had the infidelity with while you’re supposed to be working through issues with her. You ghosted her instead of being an adult and talking through feelings and situations. Now you’re taking it to the internet to justify your behavior? Nah dude. She’s better off without you as a friend or boyfriend.
btbzia,[deleted]
btc03h,YTA. No one asked your opinion on her suitability. You don't know if she's had a change of heart. Perhaps you should take a lesson out of the bible and remember that it's not your place to cast judgement.
btc11j,"YTA. 

Just tell him what you’re thinking. There’s no reason to ghost him."
btc1qj,"YTA (By definition a selfie is someone taking a shot of themselves, and quite frankly done in moderation it's a modern day self portrait and nothing to be badmouthed.)

She shouldn't have to fumble around, actually or just for show. You should offer to take photos of the woman you love, doing things she loves and being happy.

Screw this trend with documenting every little fucking thing to put on social media. HOWEVER, that being said, capturing moments together of special events is still important."
btc1zl,"NTA they're getting paid to do a job, if they cant do it, they should find a different job"
btc216,"NAH, it's just awkward."
btc36x,YTA. I'm sorry for your loss but you can't expect people to realize what's going to trigger you.  Announcing a pregnancy is not a personal attack against you. You can't expect people to not move on with their own lives just because you haven't moved on with yours.
btc3s9,"YTA - graduations are annoying af and long. Maybe they're old and get easily exhausted idk, but it's probably something legitimate. Having them afterwards for dinner is the most important!"
btc5o6,"NTA for telling his sponsor. 



He may not like it but you are ultimately caring for his life over his feelings.



Make an effort to reach out to him and see how it goes, then perhaps speak to him about telling your mother."
btc6xa,"NAH




Well wtf that's a bit weird...? 



Wouldn't he appreciate unbaised oppinions from you.... surely being married you would have good communication?"

btcqa2,"I...

Jesus I feel like I need to say either NAH or NTA but more so the NAH

9 year olds are fuckin demons. You and I are the same age and I had pretty bad ADHD as a kid too and the shit kids would say not just *to* me but *about me within earshot* was absolutely horrendous. Most of them grew out of it and became kinda nice people, some became worse, so I guess you kinda have to gauge the person he is and ask yourself if that'd help him. 

YTA if you do it with the intent to start a fight though, some things are so old that you kinda just have to move on."
btcrz8,"NTA but damn your older sister is, I would hope your parents wouldn't cut you out just because you dislike your aunt. that would be way overreacting."
btcvwr,"YTA, here's the reason why. What exactly are you expecting to get out of this? You're clearly not gaining any positive ground with this kid. I'm an atheist myself and while a lot of what you said is true and worth contemplating, harassing a friend and nitpicking every comment that comes out of their mouth is getting you nowhere. It is however making you and other people who are not religious look like assholes. You get more flies with honey than vinegar."
btcw52,"ESH. Pick your battles. This is a terrible hill to die on.

That being said, you requested her RSVP multiple times and she should have sent it."
btcwud,NTA - why not just stay at the nice people table
btczbf,"YTA - If you ever catch one of the ones on your server that's doing something highly unethical (cub porn etc.) then ban them, but banning an entire group for something they might not even be personally doing is *such* a dick move. Your main admin is right."
btczet,">Even if this is legal, it's really frustrating

YTA for calling the police for this.  Seriously what are you going to report, not great parking?"
btd04g,"NAH 

I can see where you’re coming from but don’t push it. She might not even be a lesbian to begin with. I get you wanna set the ground to make her coming out easier, but let her decide that at her own pace.

Your heart’s in the right place, but old dogs don’t learn new tricks so easily."
btd1jn,"NTA but an idiot.

There are procedures for dealing with this properly and officially. 

What you dis was not actually follow correct procedure and the result was not only getting fired but making others feel like they cant come forward because of how much you botched this."

NTA"
btd8wy,"Info: Who is bigger and who is more atheletic, your BF or Jim?

Either way, you're NTA, this is all on Jim. But I would say if your boyfriend is more alpha than Jim, *after* he calms down, he should definitely come over and have a ""heart-to-heart"" with Jim about being a gentleman. Jim obviously has no respect for women, and sometimes the only way to deal with this genre of prick is to let another man lay out the truth for them in on uncertain terms."

Using a Juul makes a person four times more likely to try cigarettes. Also you shouldn’t sell off juuls to minors in the first place so that’s a crime.

btdcc1,"NTA

Laura can fuck off. And given that Karl has a back injury, ~~this joke~~ what I'm about to say is in extremely poor taste, but - Karl needs to grow a backbone.

The school should find other ways to address the bad behavior in the restrooms."
btdqqb,"NTA, it's your property, correct? So you get to decide what's done with it. They can find another activity, or one of his 7 friends can bring THEIR PS4. Surely one of them has one."
btdr5g,"NTA.

She had no issues giving you shit in public, so she deserves to get shit back in public. Turnabout is fair play, don't give what you can't take, etc etc.

Also your friend doesn't sound like much of a friend."
btdv5q,"NTA.

Do not let her in the house if she has the dog. Play bitch games, win bitch prizes."
btdwz0,I might be unpopular to say this but NTA. There were drunk people on your roof. Your parents are lucky that THEY didn’t get charged because even though they weren’t home and didn’t supply the alcohol themselves it was their property. Some places you can get in big trouble for that. It’s entirely possible to have a low key party with alcohol where nothing happens but when shit like what you described starts going on is when people eat hurt or sick.
bte14o,ESH- she’s wrong to be so rude and not addressing whatever she’s upset about head on. You and your BF need to find your own place or he should start chipping in if he’s going to stay over most of the time- sams goes for the other roommates.
bte1a6,"NTA. Your parents are the assholes for comparing her to you. It’s perfectly reasonable to be jealous, however don’t let that turn into hateful actions."
bte2dj,"NTA.

It sounds like there'd be doubt as to whether they'd be there in support of you making a huge step in your life. As long as that doubt exists, I don't think you need to invite them."
bte3ms,"YTA... Give the girl water. Damn...

It be your own cousin.."
bte5vk,"NTA, fuck those filthy degenerates."
bte7z6,NTA -  I don't think catfishing is ever ok.
btech8,NAH. Going to be a tricky situation to tell her though! Be careful!
btee9e,"YTA

Bro, if you're in the holy place of someone else's religion, be respectful. Take off your shoes, wash your hands, cover your head - whatever the rules of that particular place are, follow them. It doesn't matter whether you actually wanted to be there or not, you're \*in their house\*, so be polite."
btegyx,"Yta. Your wife is, presumably, a grown woman. She’s allowed to participate in social media if she so chooses. Also, saying that you were stern with her? You’re not her parent. It isn’t your place to be stern with her. If you want to institute a no phones at the table rule, fine, if she’s on board, do that."
bteh9j,ESH- shoving people is something toddlers do. I understand not liking tourists. I hate them too. But the way you’re talking about them just comes across as racist and immature.
btei0c,"NAH. You pay for your half and if he only wants to stay a week he stays one week, and you stay solo for the second week. Solo travel as a female is very safe in Japan"
btejal,"Kinda over the top, and I doubt cops are going to do anything unless you live in a very, very quiet small town.  Not exactly asshole but I'd say your concern over being a busybody is probably valid."
btejgo,">As far as i'm concerned I don't care.

Then why are you posting here?"
btejid,"NTA. All of you saying he is the asshole* and calling him controlling probably don't have very healthy relationships yourselves or you are trying to be all high and mighty since OP is a guy, so he gotta be a POS, right?

Woman's opinion: she should have let you know either beforehand or to be more precise when you asked, I've never heard of brunch which lasts 6+ hours. It would take her literally a minute to text ""hey we are going shopping/whatever, I'm coming home around X"" or something similar. You did nothing wrong.

*edited for bot-clarity lol"
btelx3,You're not the asshole for not wanting to touch her belly.  Definitely YTA for telling a pregnant woman that they're gross with their big bellies.
btem6w,"NTA.

Wtf are your parents smoking that they're upset you helped your family members out financially and thus they didn't have to? They should be happy they raised such a good kid. 

Also helping out some family because you're close to them and not helping out distant family is not an asshole move. Maybe they should have taken the time to forge a stronger relationship with you if they wanted access to your wallet."
btemps,"NAH currently. In fact, I would say you would be being an asshole to your boyfriend if you didn’t at least have a serious conversation with your parents about this. It would be his home too, and he should be comfortable with any extended houseguests. A month is a really long time for your mom to stay, especially if your bf feels like he has to walk on eggshells around her."
btet2k,ESH. She sucks for cheating and you’d suck for cheating with her. Find someone single to screw.
btev0n,"YTA

You are sick. He is not sick, he gets to party. Sucks to suck, but it is what it is.

You need to be quarantined.

>The word quarantine comes from an Italian variant (seventeenth-century Venetian) of 'quaranta giorni', meaning forty days, the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the Black Death plague epidemic.

If you are still alive after 40 days then you will be permitted to see your boyfriend."
btevdd,"YTA. She has a kid at home, being able to buy lunch saves her time and might be one of the very few small pleasures she ever gets. Not to mention it’s condescending to suggest that as if she’s never thought of it— like she doesn’t know that sandwiches can be made at home? If you don’t want to give up shifts then don’t, but don’t give her advice she hasn’t asked for."
btevfz,"YTA. The kid was going for it, he should have it. Especially after he got hit by it."
btevyj,"NAH, you can be concerned if you want, but there's no reason for your friend to turn down work if **they're** comfortable taking the job. I presume the guns have some sort of safety mechanism, that the couple know safe firearm handling, and you said they never brandished the weapon toward your friend. Guns don't randomly point themselves at people and go-off."
btez0u,"YTA.

Um, your ex has no obligation to mend **your** relationship to your kids. Building up trust and love takes time, and the onus is on your to encourage the relationship if you've been absent from their lives. Threatening her with court isn't going to help with that, either."
btez9f,"NTA.

She wouldn't have hurried if she'd gotten there first. What a self-centered twat."
btf14o,"NAH.

It's weird they keep asking tbh. But you can be honest since they're pushing for it."
btf29m,"NTA. She's old enough to go try that attitude in the real world and see how far it gets her. Your wife clearly didn't do some parenting right, sorry to say. I wouldn't allow someone to live under my roof and disrespect my dead child.

Edit. Thank you for the silver, friend!"
btf2oj,"NAH The child asked,you answered.Its not something not suitable for a child to know.I don't see an issue here."
btf2u0,NTA - but I feel this is something you should mention to him so he is more mindful of it in the future.  I do feel you’re entitled to compensation for your time under these circumstances.
btf5hy,"YTA

Not illegal but manipulative and over the top. 

What you should have done was called her, identified yourself and your company, and asked for her dad's contact information. That would have been doing your job.

What you did was several levels above that. 

The sad thing is, even after going above and beyond for the law firm and walking straight past the line of professionalism, into mild sociopath territory for them... I doubt they're going to give you a bonus or a raise or anything more than an ""attaboy"".

Personally I think that if a job requires you to lie or manipulate people in order to obtain the best result, you shouldn't do it. Or at the very least, you should demand a lot more money for it."
btf6z7,"NTA. Have you tried filing a noise complaint?

&#x200B;

Just talking to someone else, especially a professional, could be a major stress reliever. Maybe you could have worded that differently but you aren't the asshole for making a perfectly rational recommendation that, \*shocker\*, might help everyone involved."
btf7uu,"What the fuck is wrong with you? You petty, petty asshole. I think I know why they want to move out early.

YTA."
btf9oo,"NTA. You aren't in the wrong for feeling disappointed and jealous that someone else received a position that you desired, and it doesn't sound like you have been taking it out on her. I'm sorry that the situation has turned out like this. Although you would have had the right to request that she refrain from submitting an application to that job, she still had the right to apply for the same job and further her career. 

Still, I can't help but feel that it was insensitive of her since she knew about your living situation and feelings. Furthermore, I feel that she is not being very thoughtful about your feelings and is only focusing on her own emotions by going on and on about the opportunity, even saying that she doesn't care about receiving it. If you feel comfortable, perhaps you could talk to her about the situation and how you feel because she might not be aware of what she is doing."

While I understand that you had a hard time, she also has her own needs and life that need taken care of."
btfnq8,"NTA but why start with the solution you've dreamt up? Just tell your wife ""hey, I know you and her are friends, but she really grates my nerves. I feel like she's always bagging on me and I want to avoid being rude to your friend if I get frustrated. Do you think there's something we can do to avoid conflict?"" And see what she says. Maybe suggest you plan a night out if they're planning a night in, etc."
btfny9,"It’s a difficult situation, I’d confront T first and tell her that J really likes her and it isn’t right for her to lead J on, especially if she isn’t putting in the same amount of effort into the relationship that J does. If she says she’s not going to stop then you have all rights to tell J and warn him about T then you’re NTA she is. If she does change then it’s all good and you telling J about what she did prior and instilling trust issues in him and their relationship then YTA."
btftkf,NTA - good for you standing up to a bully. Just because he’s your dad doesn’t mean he’s not a bully. You don’t deserve to be treated like that. Well done. I think a rational conversation with him where you tell him you’re tired of the constant comments about your weight would help. I also think you could ask him how he’s doing. Most bullies IMO are insecure about something about themselves and turn the attention away by picking on other people. Maybe he’s struggling with some things right now. Or maybe he’s a just a dick.

btfygv,"Definitely NTA to suggest it, if your roommates room is so considerable nicer than yours or the other's then it should be addressed in the rent. You can't force them to pay more rent, but you can definitely open up the conversation for it."
btg106,You're kind of TA for expecting anyone to know not to move a pillow because your laptop will break without it. But ESH for their reaction to accidentally breaking something important you needed.
btgai2,"NTA If she's going to be bigoted toward your girlfriend, she isn't worth being friends with."
btgcu9,"YTA. This was racist, and you clearly don’t care about your girlfriend that much if you gave her the food you thought was inferior."
btgd7k,"Of course YTA. What are you gonna do, go your entire life never meeting them because you have anxiety? I have insane anxiety myself but I try not to let it stop me, especially if it effects someone else. Incredibly selfish man. Just meet them."
btgdpq,NTA.  People who use their minority status as a cover to intentionally hurt people are a special kind of fucked up.  If the school isn’t helping you should probably go higher up.
btgeef,"YTA. It is their money, you don't get a say in this. You can make a wishlist but that's it."
btgejg,"NAH - you are trying your best to do right by your father and respect his gf and your mother.

I think you are handling things perfectly."
btgitk,"I was conflicted on this, but I'm going to go with ESH. Dont get me wrong, she seems like an asshole, but you can't really invite someone without inviting their spouse to an event like a wedding without being kind of an asshole too. I'm not saying to invite her; weddings sometimes require this sort of thing, but you should be aware that it's an asshole move."
btgj3x,ESH...except the Asian lady. Get those gains cute Asian lady.
btgmb0,"YTA, you don't make other people a part of your scenes without prior consent. You could've told your sister a perfectly acceptable version of the truth that allowed her to maintain a remove from your fetish, you didn't have to give her the one that included the details of your D/s relationship. She's family, she doesn't want to know what gets y'all off."
btgo7m,Nta- It sounds like descrimination. But not sure how your area views or enforces it
btgpfm,YTA! You aren't their parents and you don't get to make that choice for them!
btgvvh,NTA. You’ve done more the enough she needs to learn responsibilities.
btgw0b,"NAH, but it’s there house I wouldn’t expect much of a change even if you tell them something"
btgwfq,"Look, you can’t be forced to do this but YTA, especially if you base your decision on some Reddit research and not much else. Your wife had your children and I’m willing to bet she’s been mostly responsible for birth control throughout your marriage, unless you’ve been using condoms the whole time. She’s asking you to take on a much smaller level of risk and long-term changes to your body than she has, for the benefit of your family."
btgyls,"NTA, they sound toxic, but don't push. He has to do it himself. Just be supportive."
btgyy8,"NTA.  Your house, your rules.  Everything gets to be your way because he pays no rent.  He’s being cruel to your dog.  What more do you need to hear?"
btgz1n,"NTA. Sounds like she has a problem and might need to go to therapy. You are probably enabling her by not being honest about how she’s making you feel. She might think that you appreciate her attention and text messages. The more energy she spends on obsessing over her kids, the harder it’s going to be for her to move on and have normal hobbies."
bth01k,"ESH - Obviously they shouldn’t have been using the path but your manager should have dealt with it, not you. And the trash can? Passive-aggressive bullshit."
bth0te,NTA and I commend you for setting boundaries and expectations with her. Please stick to them if she doesn’t make an effort.
bth452,NTA - it was clearly obvious his apology was not heartfelt ... And damn your wife threatened to leave you if it happened again? That's just ludacris! She needs to remind herself of the vows she took and that you had a perfectly valid reason for getting upset and saying what you said to him.
bth504,"NTA, she sounds like a downer and honestly so self absorbed she wouldnt even notice you stopped communicating. I don't get people who continue to have kids that they hate."
bth69z,"“Capitalizing on free donuts and people watching”?

Really?  At a cemetery?   YTA"
bth6c6,"I'm gonna go with NTA

She didn't give you a real hint to take. The one digit off thing she had to know was easily verifiable against the schedule and easily written off as a mistake. You don't make plans with someone you aren't interested in if you want them to take a hint.

It was one of your boss' female friends who stepped in it so to speak and you had a reasonable expectation that your boss would just dismiss the whole thing as unimportant like a reasonable boss should. You had now way of knowing that he would can Amanda for such a stupid reason.

Amanda's NTA either. Shes just dumb for stringing you along and then acting like there was some hint you were supposed to take. Be glad you dodged that bullet, this is the type of shit really duplicitous people pull.

No, the only Asshole here is your boss. He should have just ignored the whole thing as long as nobody was harrassed or harmed. But severely overreacted and fired Amanda for something which had nothing to do with her ability to do her job.

Edit: Just because Amanda is *an* asshole, doesn't mean she is *the* asshole.

2nd Edit: I didnt expect this to be the top comment. Many of you have pointed out that she became a much more pronounced asshole when she gossiped about standing OP up behind his back. Considering this, I would have to agree and say Amanda is definitely the asshole. Further more, I now think that the boss was right to get rid of her on the grounds that she intentionally led OP on while not being into him not once but twice. That behavior makes her a liability because if she repeats it and then makes a harrassment claim, that would have huge ramifications for the studio financially."
bth7l8,"You are SO NTA. Trust me, there will be many times when you will have no idea how to cope with your child. And you are an exceptional person for standing up for your wife. You both need one another to solidify your efforts and support each other. Your wife was bullied by a POS to endanger your child and you should try to make her see that and provide the support she needs to hold her ground and not second guess her motherly instincts."
bth7md,"that’s not he Lord’s Prayer either 😂 it’s “O Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name...”"
bth9tq,"I don't agree *at all.*

Making a customer pay extra for an order which the waiter fucked up is just so beyond ridiculous, I would *actually* deduct the extra cost from their tip. 

Him telling her that he would ""take the dollar out of her tip"" is just telling her that she can either not charge him for her own fuckup, or that she has to live with a smaller tip: not for fucking up the order, but for seriously expecting a customer to pay for her mistake. 

If it was only a joke, and he ended up tipping her well anyway, that makes OP doubly NTA.

edit: to clarify, I still think OP could have handled the situation better. But he is still not an asshole for handling it this way."
btha67,"NAH. No harm in taking your kids over if they and Danny will enjoy it. But if you aren’t comfortable, you’re not an a-hole."
bthaly,"NTA he was going upstairs and could have carried the baby. It’s not like it’s that heavy, he was acting like a child."
bthbth,"NTA

You felt uncomfortable and out of place. It’s hard to stay at a function where everybody knows each other and you’re the only stranger. Especially since you said your gf wasn’t really introducing you to anybody."
bthcms,Take him to court. I wouldn’t suggest just contacting his family to tell them. They will figure it out when you go after child support.
bthe4f,NTA - She sounds bizarrely entitled.
bthex2,YTA sounds like you wanted all the boys panting at your feet and now you're pissed because Hannah is with a guy you saw as a good backup. men aren't shiny presents for you to keep on a shelf in case you want them someday.
bthf22,[deleted]
bthhfp,"NTA because you honestly just wanted to get out of seeing him. If he traumatized you that badly, he shouldn’t have been given access to see you. Also, if everything you said was true, then nothing is your fault. He can’t get mad at his own mistakes. The court messed up, not you."
bthjz4,"NAH you're not an ass your wife isn't, well okay your BSIL is but I do think you're jumping about twenty steps don't make a big deal out of something that at this point doesn't really even seem like a possibility you're worrying over something that frankly probably won't be an issue."
bthm1b,"NAH. They should have checked pockets before selling something, and you technically bought that money from them so I don't think anyone is at faultid you choose to keep it. You could return it if you feel less guilty doing so though"
bthm9b,"YTA  
And here's why- you obviously don't have problems with screen time as you are already letting the kid facetime all his bio relatives back home. And you don't seem to be worried about the privacy issue. At least I can assume you aren't worried about the nanny recording these calls.  
What you do say is this-"" but as he grows awareness into what facetime is and who the people on the other end of the screen are I do not want him to make connections with my helper's family in that same way, or if I'm being honest, at all. ""  
This is a sort of vague way of saying, ""I want my baby to bond with and recognize people of his own race and background, but not hers.""  
No matter how good she is at cooking, cleaning the house and taking care of your baby, there is  apparently ""a bit of a line,"" as you put it, that you will not cross."
bthmpu,NTA but she needs somewhere to go at least drive her to a women’s shelter near by.
bthmt8, NTA. You already had a commitment
bthnm6,"YTA. This is why so many men have trouble being more in touch with things considered to be feminine :/ also there are very, very manly gay dudes out there."
btho9p,"NTA-He is just being racist and mean towards you and your fiancée, you should only invite him if he agrees to stop being racist and if your fiancée is ok with it."
bthowj,"NAH. Yes she was a bit over the top needy but I think some people simply don’t cope well when sick. 
I’d also be frustrated and annoyed by her behaviour but you did great to stick it out and help her. 
I would like to say that her mysterious joint inflammation may be real. I have an autoimmune disease that has no definitive test and often has low or no blood markers but causes horrible joint inflammation that eventually damages your joints if left untreated. 
Good luck with your studies."
bthr5i,"NTA, you are doing your job as parents. S is clearly a bad influence. A 12 year old should not be sexually active, something is very wrong in that home. You are doing the right thing keeping your daughter away from that."
bthrb6,"ESH. He sounds overly cynical, but it sounds like you’re being a bit petty/passive aggressive about it. Have you brought up with him directly that it bothers you he tries to downplay your friends achievements and that it feels like he’s trying to demean them? They’re your friends so it’s fair for you to feel defensive, I’d make sure he knows you care about them and feel like his negativity toward them is unnecessary."
bthso0,"NTA 
Oooookaay, she needs to chill. It’s a game, and you played it very well. She sounds like a sore looser."
bthx2v,A lot of parents do
bthz9j,"NTA Communication is extremely important in any relationship, whether it be family, platonic or romantic. She may have been made uncomfortable by you telling her that you had her and is trying to make it so you stop feeling that way or leave all together. Talk to her, explain how you feel and try understanding what she feels and why she feels that way. Hopefully you can work things out."
bti1xw,NTA. I’m sorry my dude but you’re probably not getting your money back from your dad. Best bet is to move out when you’re an adult and don’t trust him with any money or anything money related again because he’ll use it to control you.
bti8ve,"NTA - they sound like jerks. At the same time, there are probably other spouses there in a similar situation to you. Check back in to these events when you feel up to it - they aren't the only ladies there and you could meet new cool people."
bti9qq,"Next time, lock the register mid-order, go put the item back, then resume ringing her up. ""I'm sorry, ma'am, perishable items must be returned immediately. Just doing my job."""

btie40,NTA what the ACTUAL FUCK are these people thinking? They’re protecting you from yourself? GOOD LORD.
btie6r,NTA they ruined the movie for everybody. It’s a waste of money to go to a movie that you can’t even hear because of a screaming baby.
btifhf,"NTA.

She needs to learn to take responsibility. She's a grown adult."
btikh2,"NAH yet, but tread carefully. This is a PERFECT situation for the [Ring Theory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201705/ring-theory-helps-us-bring-comfort-in). If at all possible, vent your feelings to someone who is less affected by his sister's death than you are, not more. After you've really let it out with someone on an outer ring, THEN consider mentioning it to him, but be mindful about it and know it could absolutely blow up in your face.

FWIW, when I lost my only sibling who my SO had only met once, I knew it was hard on him but I loved him for framing it as how difficult it was for him to see me in pain and not be able to do anything about it, not as his own grief over the loss of my sibling."
btimd4,"NTA. HES the asshole. Your mom’s health is in question and he’s mad cuz you spent five minutes on the phone with her? Not to mention, STILL MAD DAYS LATER?"
btimx6,"NTA.

>the other managers i told think i am an asshole and should have let the police deal with it,

Why the hell didn't the managers deal with it?"
btimz6,">They broke up a year ago but my friend still hasn’t gotten over her.

how is any of that relevant? you betrayed your friend lmao. You're the asshole obviously. 

>but my friend knows and feels betrayed by what i did/ am doing.

probably because you betrayed your friend.... 


look you can date whoever you want. but when you do shit like this be prepared to not be friends with them anymore.... cause no fucking shit.... with friends like that who would need enemies?"
btin9z,"NTA

She's not ""being awkward"", she is molesting/groping you without your consent. Her utter lack of shame over her actions is appalling and garners being totally cut off.

EDIT: This is literally sexual assault, if I wasn't being clear."
btiqk2,"YTA. First off, you should have never considered going to the afterparty without her. You should have either bought two tickets or bought none.  But more importantly, if someone's coming two hours in to spend time with you, they're your guest, and, and this is an important rule in general:

You don't ditch a guest. You're almost always the asshole if you expect your guest to spend a significant amount of time without you around.

This was an ill conceived plan on your part, and you're the asshole for even considering leaving her alone after she's taken a two hour drive to come down."
btit5b,"NTA, validation post. You already know you're not the asshole because you're emphatically calling them dirty slobs. You're just ranting."
btiuq5,"NAH. You can want to stay friends all you like, if he doesn't want to, then he doesn't want to. 

Lesson learned; don't let someone talk you into a relationship. If you have to be convinced, then obviously the feelings probably aren't there."
btj1fi,"NTA. You do the work, you get the pay. If the counter person isn't doing it splitting it evenly for you both every time, but just dividing it when you get it that's a problem. I'd talk to management about tip policy."
btj1nb,"NTA.  You've told her repeatedly that you don't want her sleeping in your bed. And there's a perfectly good spare bed just sitting there waiting for someone to sleep in it. 

She was super rude."
btj2i7,"NTA.


just because she's old doesnt mean she doesnt deserve to be called out. she's obviously allowed to have opinions, but when those opinions hurt that someone and she denies she ever said anything? not cool, grandma"
btjd71,[deleted]
btjde9,"NTA... But it sounds like you two have bigger issues if he's pissed at you for ""always second guessing him"".

Either that, or he's just an asshole."
btjo07,NTA. That just sounds like a territorial response on behalf of your child. How old are they?
btjp4h,NAH - it sounds like you guys are naturally growing apart and want different things from life.
btjtyl,YTA. Don't be purposefully annoying.
btjv0p,"ESH- Yeah, ""Father Time"" was wrong for the bullshit he pulled, but you should've just called him on it, & left out alone, but ""IF"" this was the ""AHA MOMENT"" that you discovered that YOU CAN stand up for yourself if wronged, i can see someone going a lil overboard, he became the object of everyone else who wronged you, & you didn't say anything to..."
btjvmu,"Absolutely NTA, your roommate sounds like one of the typical college dog owners that borders on neglectful and leaves you to deal with the mess."
btk7rd,"Those are coming off as red flags, buddy. She’s been on two dates and is already claiming ownership of your clothes and your hobbies? Yeesh. Clingy, much?"
btk957,"NTA, until you choose to join finances it's not your responsibility"
btkcuy,"NAH. But if he tells you he’s not coming over anymore b/c his gf doesn’t like it, then that’s it."
btkdal,"YTA. If you only broke up with her recently, and it was meant to be an amicable break-up, there's no reason to go making public subtweets about great another girl is - if you wanted to say that you could have said it to your friend directly. 

I never get the point of going 'Nobody Understands Me except X Person' in format that is literally designed for everyone else to see it. It always comes off as inherently jerky to me. I do think a brief apology is in order."
btkedl,[deleted]
btkiil,NTA. Family issues in your manager’s life aren’t your problem. Turn in your two weeks notice and move on.
btkkl1,"NTA

She was trying to control you."
btklxk,NTA. It's the job of staff to deal with this kind of situation. Which might include not selling an already intoxicated patron more alcohol. And escorting patrons outside when needed.
btklxn,"NTA your house your rules, you can do what you want and her being ill does not justify her toxic controlling attitude."
btkmxn,"NTA

But it's incredibly unproductive. It sounds like you had an awful childhood and you can both appreciate aspects of it and be upset about other aspects. Nobody's a perfect parent and it looks like yours were flawed in meaningful ways. *However*, there is literally nothing you can do to change your childhood.

Getting resentful about all of it is a waste of time and energy. It's in your best interest to work with what you've got, probably seek therapy about it and move your life forward from where are actually are and not where you think you should be."
btko1x,"NTA.  

A baby elephant weighs about 250lb after its born, making it the second biggest baby on land, after your friend."
btkow6,"NTA- but if you fuck with him, yta. I understand the impulse, but he’s going to get himself fired. Just report his behavior and leave it alone."
btkso2,"NTA. 

At the end of the day, yes you may have caused him some issues and it was your fault but you are not the asshole. 

You couldn't have known that his mother would have found them and for him or his friends to blame you is stupid."
btkuy8,"ESH were you right for removing the names. Yes, but you should let them know if they need to make up the paper. They are bigger assholes than the two of you though."
btl56y,.
btl5cf,NTA
btl8bh,"Oh man. YTA. Your kid is SEVEN. This is a huge burden for such a young child. This was hard for me to deal with when I found out *as an adult child.* You need to follow the advice of the professionals here, or risk doing even more damage to your poor daughter's emotional health."
btlbjw,"NAH

Lying to her isn't great, but sometimes white lies are a necessary evil. Honestly your coworker should have done more research into the field in the context of your area before changing, so some second hand experiences might be quite good for her to hear.

Hope everything goes well for her and you."
btldqg,"YTA. You CHOSE to put in that effort for her. You made the choice to prioritize her over school and yourself. That's on you. She's not obligated to return the favor because she has better boundaries than you do. Some people don't compromise their life to help someone else; it sucks that she's busy, but demanding she make time for you because you think she owes you is shitty.

If you want to spend time with her and be her friend though, talk to her about making *some* time for you."
btlizv,[deleted]
btlj6n,NTA. He knew you had to work the next day. Super immature. I also assume he has a cell phone? No head's up would be a dick move regardless.
btlp2t,[deleted]
btlvrw,"NTA.

But since you said he’s done some unkind things and would not do mediation, I wonder if he cares less for the dog and more for using the dog to keeps tabs on you or to manipulate you.

Edit: a word."
btlww8,"NTA - you told him that you weren’t attracted to men and he isn’t respecting that and making you feel extremely uncomfortable. Block him, cut ties and find a new friend."
btm3rr,"NTA

You are not obligated to put up with someone who is trying to hurt you, even if it’s not physically. Telling you to “get over” someone trying to do that is not okay either."
btm5lu,"This sounds like a validation seeking post. 

Everyone is gonna agree with the ruling of NTA. When you tell someone that they have a problem and their only defense is that y'all are supposed be his friends, than yeah obviously the dude is a dickhead."
btm6mr,"NTA, it would be a good idea to inform her if you know this guy, and how. She should know as early as possible, but be permitted to make her own decisions."
btmcsc,NTA. Fuck that guy. Calling you a dick friend cause you will not give him money? Geez sounds like he is lucky you even write him.
btmgbc,YTA if you just want to mooch off his account. NTA if you offer to split the cost or do something else if you can’t pay like drive him to school or something

btmqhc,NTA your friend is a fake feminist.
btmsq0,"NTA it’s your flat just as much as it is hers. If you’re ready to move out over a picture, then it’s time to move out."
btn2kf,NTA.  He's not using you for personal tech support. He's using you for business-related tech support. You have every right to charge him in this context.
btn3vt,"NTA 

But seeing as your friend basically dropped the puppy and ran, I wouldn't hold out much hope that she'd pay up."
btn5aw,"NTA to your question because to can't be an ass for having feelings. 

But...this is a boyfriend problem, not a boyfriend parents problem. He's the one who has let this become a habit."
btn5qi,"YTA.    Sharing with a therapist ok, sharing with DAD of all people bad.   The very man he's trying ultimately to impress you've now painted as 'flawed'

As a fellow BiPolar check your boundaries.   In fact do a low grade hypomania check in.    Oversharing is one of those ways we let go into our schtick/illness.   /r/bipolar"
btnajx,"NTA 

If there’s a specific rule then I wouldn’t be concerned, however if there’s a life guard or attendant on duty, I’d clarify with them before moving it or ask them to claim it as abandoned property."
btnblo,"I'm going to go the ""unpopular opinion"" route here.  YTA.  The guy behind you was likely annoyed by the same thing that annoys me about this situation (having been in it).  If a man does this (seen it happen more than once) he doesn't just get nasty looks, he gets called out and skewered for it.  Seen it, experienced it, nearly identical situation.  The hypocrisy and double-standard pisses me off (pun only slightly intended).

I don't entirely blame you, but I'm still sticking with YTA because of the blatant double standard."
btnbtx,"YTA for being insincere 

What kind of relationship are you hoping to have?"
btnf8x,"Your business... You can *not* hire someone for any reason or no reason... And you have valid reasons.

NTA (The so being the asshole, the guy i don't know what's his deal)."
btnfzx,NTA. You aren’t obligated to be friends with anyone you don’t want to be friends with.
btngsc,"YTA. What you’re doing isn’t enough to be an asshole IMO, but keeping a big secret like this from her ain’t good. This might lead to a confrontation in the future and put your relationship at risk."
btnj1u,"NAH.

But I think you need to talk with your girlfriend honestly about how you feel about pets. If she loves animals this much it's entirely likely that she will not be happy with you long term and you need to be honest and upfront with her because it sounds like you will ALWAYS have an excuse to not have a pet around because at the end of the day... Sounds like you don't like them and she needs to be prepared for that so she can make the decision to either stay or leave you."
btnjkg,"NTA: that’s your own time. It’s your life and your decision, it doesn’t make you an asshole. If they want to go to the gym to ‘get started’ they can get a personal trainer or go with someone else. You even offered them a diet plan! How could they call you an asshole??"
btnn3q,"NTA

You were looking forward to an easy kid-free weekend and he not only takes his kids (which is totally okay) but invites himself to your house so you could handle all of the domestic duties (cooking, cleaning, entertaining the kids). He pretty much sucks, in this instance.

Seriously think about how this relationship would play out in the future.  If he expects this from you when you're only dating, how would the workload of domestic responsibilities fall if you lived together?"
btnogl,"Most of the time ""AITA for thinking"" or ""AITA for wanting"" threads are auto-NTAs, but this one is different.

You ARE the asshole for wanting him to not get the job, and you know that."

btnuvu,Clearly NTA but you need to be careful as it can be hard to be told you've picked a bad person. I'd just explain to her that you are worried about her and want her to be happy and safe and supported. I'd suggest only saying it once and then just be there no matter what decisions she makes.
bto204,"Yta- wtf, he says he’s engaged because your motives were clearly transparent and you consider “she doesn’t have to know” a joke??? Leave this person alone, you clearly have no respect for them, their relationships or their boundaries."
bto2ih,YWBTA. This isn’t something you should expect your husband to do for you while you relax at home.
bto4ln,NTA. I don't care what anyone says your girlfriend is the asshole. She was encouraging your 15 year old sister to date a 20 year old to make herself feel better about her own past. That is very messed up.

Tipping culture in America is twisted and NOT the norm around the world.  Furthermore, when traveling the world, it is essential that you follow the customs and culture of whichever country you're in.

btozkn,"NTA

There are rules and laws in place for patient privacy. It's a serious violation if you betray them. You aren't just saying that because you don't like him, but because you care about those he is essentially betraying the trust of, and I'd argue him. My mother also can't talk about the different people she deals with at work, and I'm her son, who she knows would never repeat anything, but she still keeps quiet or keeps it very vague. Yes he is human, but that doesn't put him above the rules set in place."

Your friend made you feel like crap, and you told them how you felt.

Also, if your friend can't take being told that they're being a dick, it's time to find new friends."

You were shitty to *use* a human being."
btp5r4,"I’d probably say NTA. It wasn’t your fault how the school made changes and for the lack of sign ups, but I maybe would have tried to host or something instead of entering the pageant. I know that you were trying to be funny, but if it’s an event that’s a school standard and is done and funny in a specific way, I would be annoyed if someone came in and seemed to have changed the whole thing. My HS did a similar event and the girls ran it and the guys competed. It’s not your fault that the school changed the name and no one came/entered, but if it’s a beloved event and someone changed it, I would have been annoyed."
btp5w4,"NTA. There's a lot of stuff going on here, but none of it matters as much as this: If you don't like them, you don't have to date them.

It sounds like your husband needs to be firmer here, I don't know how you are expected to potentially host people that are hostile to you and disrespect you."

You have every right to cut your parents out of your life when you become an adult. It's as simple as that.

He's hurt? Tough shit, he had 21 years to create a relationship with you built on mutual respect and an enjoyment of time spent together. Instead, he's been abusive and you don't owe him a goddamn thing. When adults make a child, that is their decision. They owe you 18 years of care, you don't owe them anything."

If you regularly have sex with her, it's a reasonable expectation that she would consent to it even if not drunk. Also, you were drunk, which kind of puts her on the same position.

This probably won't be the last time you both have sex intoxicated, its just part of life."
btpnxb,[removed]
btpqch,"NAH, though I would eliminate the word “confront” from this situation, for good. You are worried about her, and for more reasons other than how her anxiety impact s YOUR life. Frame it that way, because it isn’t about you. Tell her that you are worried for her, and worried for how she responds to certain situations because you’ve seen her flourish and this ain’t it. Tell her you want to see her be happy and carefree as much as possible, because she deserves to feel that way. Encourage her to seek professional help, and remind her that she isn’t her anxiety, and that you love the hell out of her."
btpt6w,"YTA. You went way overboard. As a general rule, if you're ever on twitter and you're using more than two tweets that don't include images/links (which want to be separated) you're going overboard. 

""When you don't understand something, ask"" is actually fine. But when someone tells you to back off because it can be emotionally exhaustive, you don't tell them they're wrong just because you're not feeling the same emotions.

You're not the asshole for raising the question. You're the asshole for telling the person who responded to you with telling them they're coming off as smug, unsure, and/or mean. When it's very clear how they're coming across: as someone who sees this question all the time and doesn't have the energy to keep answering it. You're the asshole for INSISTING on an 'open-minded discussion' with someone who clearly just doesn't want to talk about it."
btpx3l,"NTA

Your in laws are doing a shitty job of teaching him right from wrong. Those aren't things that just get excused. Even if you're extremely low functioning you can eventually understand the differences between good and bad behavior.

His parents shouldn't just be giving him a pass and it seems like your husband recognizes that to some degree as well.

You aren't forced to just excuse his behavior too."

If you want to forgive and move on, that's fine. But it sounds like your wife felt very alone when she could've used more support. And she couldn't go to *you* because, well, you had cancer. But I imagine if you talk to her about that time in your lives, she's talk to you a lot about worry, stress, sleepless nights, while trying to keep all the ""normal"" stuff going. (Did you ever do laundry during that time? Take the garbage out? Clean the bathroom? Or all the other mundane tasks that need to happen even when someone is very sick?)

She doesn't want to meet this spineless, selfish dude. If you want to hang out with him, that's your business, but you shouldn't subject her to it."

btqjln,"ESH. You're on a family vacation. Listening to music on your phone is a clear sign of tuning your family out and distancing yourself from conversations. It's just outright rude. But it's also clear that your mother severely overreacted. 

It also sounds like you being on your phone instead of paying attention to people is a common occurrence, so maybe keep that in mind."
btqlty,"Yup, YTA, but with good intentions.  You didn't put yourself in this situation, but it is the one you find yourself in.  You committed to being a bridesmaid, so that's what you need to do.

btr2l8,YTA for dipping into your IRA.
btr66s,"ESH. On your part, because of your response. It seems that drinking that bottle of wine might have hurt your brother as it meant something to him. By saying you don't care, you're admitting his feelings don't mean that much to you or you aren't willing to acknowledge them.

Your brother is an asshole for not standing by his word to ""take anything,"" and especially for getting a ton of free work out of you and not allowing you to just pay it back without raging."

I think that you guys should have had at least a discussion about it beforehand."

Edit - Even after your edit, you have to realize your father was trying to control you via reverse psychology and instead of getting the end result that he wanted, which was you being meek & submissive; what he got was pretty much a ""STFU with your two-faced bullshit"" from you. That's what giving the $500 is to him, hence why he's mad at you - he knows you figuratively put the money where his mouth is and he honestly can't say nothing about it."

I think this is one of those things you'd be an asshole to bring up since someone might just be looking out for you. If you flip out and tell someone ""don't stir my pot, you aren't the damn chef!""

bttywk,"NTA - maybe her husband needs to go back to third grade and review his fractions. A half a drink plus a half a drink is only one drink over the course of an hour.  If he is expecting you to have gotten blasted on two drinks over two hours, he must have been putting something other than ethanol in his drinks.

Then she is doubly the asshole for bringing it up to you several times and then putting it on you for being so damn sensitive on the topic. You are quite right that that’s a type of gaslighting, and your “friends” have shown themselves to be manipulative and disingenuous."

She sees you are having a hard time waking up at 9 and was still tired because you stayed up too late.  So in her mind she's taking away your toy so instead of playing you'll go to sleep.

You can try to sit down with her and talk it out, but at the end of the day if you're still living in her house she's probably going to keep treating you like a kid.

NAH"

btuauj,"NAH. She has the right to post sexually suggestive photos; you have the right to be upset about them. Rather than asking which of you is an a-hole, perhaps you should ask yourselves why you feel the way you do. Does she post these photos because she needs external validation?

I realize that grief often brings out the worst side of people, and families tend to fight a lot after the death of a loved one. It literally is not worth it. Let it go. Everybody in your family lost someone they loved. Your dad lost a parent. Let him grieve the way he needs to, and you do the same. This is not the time or place to air out your family drama."

btuoeo,"I’m just confused as to why you’re getting pissed off? I’m sure she will stop eventually and while it might be *slightly* annoying. Sounds like she’s just going through a phase of calling them that way. 

If your mum had a real, genuine issue with it she could sit down and talk to her about why she would prefer to be called “mum” 

But I doubt anyone in your family has a real genuine issue with this, you just find it annoying because she’s your sister and you want to find her annoying. 

NAH."
btupeg,"NTA. Ok I am a dog owner, and I have the same complaint that you have. There are leash laws for a reason. Dogs are dogs, not people no matter how much they are part of our families. Dogs do dog things, just a fact. And I don’t care how sweet or loving or well behaved a dog is, he is still a dog and shit happens. My problem with people who don’t leash their dogs, is that WHEN shit happens, the dog is the one who suffers the consequences for its owners stupidity, and that’s not cool. Not to mention someone else getting hurt unnecessarily. It’s bullshit. Also, those same owners are usually the ones who don’t clean up after their dogs. I hate it. I live near a place where most people don’t use the leash as they should. There’s always a problem. Ugh. However, it’s never cool to curse someone out like that, especially when their dog is unleashed and may feel the need to protect its owner. Maybe go to a town meeting and bring up the issue?"
btuptl,Wow I would definitely love a dog more than someone who got jealous of a dog. YTA
btuqci," NTA. Sounds like you reached out plenty to help him.  Just playing video games to get over depression doesn’t cut it, leaving jobs that were just handed to him, SO coming and going,  this is beyond what ever help you can give him.  But I congratulate you on going the extra mile to try."

btux56,"YTA. Speaking as a woman who has had several guy friends disappear when it became apparent that we would not become romantically involved, the situation you describe is shitty.  You’re basically saying that it’s a romantic relationship or none at all. If you’re not interested in her friendship, you’re not interested in her on any real level.  It hurts when men do this to their female friends. It makes us feel like we were never anything but a goal or conquest to them.   Like we were someone who could be thrown away as soon as sex was off the table. Do her a favor and get out of her life now."
btv34o,NTA Walk away. She's not a friend. Sounds like she is getting immense joy out of messing with you. Her telling people you are stalking her is a red flag...run

Second, regardless of whatever reason your friend has for needing a ride, he can’t just expect someone else to give them a ride. He’s not entitled to it. 

Third, the other friend was a bit rude because someone was acting entitled to his time and his ride, and even if he’s “lazy” it doesn’t matter because *you aren’t entitled to his ride*"
btvdo1,"Nah. Totally get why you aren't super keen.
You should go though. This may be the last time you will have the time to spend with your grandmother. 

Perhaps you and your sister could do a little side trip together for a few days to decompress?"

btvmww,"YTA

Sorry to hear about your sister."
btx3x5,"NTA

Was tempted to say no assholes here, but the baby mama and her mom pressuring a teenager to get married when the relationship is already on shaky footing is an asshole move.  If you were asked to talk to the baby mama, then you have the blessing of one of the parties involved to give your input.  I don't see how you could be an asshole in that situation."
btx5c4,[deleted]
btx5l1,"NTA. You and your partner have your own rules. If he has never shown any indication that he has a problem with this, then he probably doesn’t. You could always ask him, but honestly I don’t think there’s an issue. My partner and I have been together for 9+ years and often use each other’s phones if it’s the closer one, never given it a second thought!"
btxbbn,"NTA. She did cheat and who knows if she will do it again. Tell him but be completely honest, show him the messages as well so it doesn’t seem like you are just jealous."
btxcbh,NAH- ofc you want to be able to comfort her and understand what she is going thru. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious either and I don't even know you guys lol
btxf0d,"NTA. 

Your life, your decision. You are not obligated to do anything you feel uncomfortable with."
btxfn8,"ESH - Your roommate is awful but what you did was incredibly stupid. She can sue you for the damages to her furniture and the landlord can take the cost of cleaning up your stunt out of your security deposit. 

If you wanted to prove a point then you could have put the bag in another bag and put it in her room. You could have even placed the bag in her room or outside her door. Throwing it through a window and damaging her things because you're bitter about doing dishes is immature. You say you can't afford to live anywhere else but you can get kicked out for that."
btxivb,"ESH - the girl should probably have mentioned the cost before going ahead with the printing.  However, you didn’t clarify whether there would be a cost for her to do the printing.  There have been miscommunications on both sides.  Based on this, you should stump up your share of the cost.  $6 is a trivial amount of cash to create a drama about."
btxkin,"This is a tough one.  You must already know that no matter how right you are, that comment likely won't be well recieved.  NAH i guess.  Good luck.  Expect some fallout, but only you can decide if the clean toilet is gonna be worth it."
btxnm1,YTA x You are throwing a ball that is hitting your neighbors house and waking them up. You don’t know their work schedules. Instead of apologizing for the accident you and your kid double down and tell them to screw themselves.
bty1lh,NTA he dug his own grave. I'd do it if I were you
bty24n,"NAH - Talk to her. Every problem at a D&D table can be solved, one way or another, by talking to each other like adults.

Let her know you appreciate everything she does but paying for all the extras that aren't really needed isn't your responsibility."
bty2wr,"NTA. Your siblings are assholes for not even being willing to see your perspective, and for thinking they are entitled to your labor. Sometimes a home with professional, well-rested caregivers is the better choice."
bty4qm,"YTA if you push it, let the man have his pride."
bty4qp,"YTA. Go back to school, apologize to your teacher, and attempt to squeeze whatever education you can out of your failing school without taking it out on the underpaid and overworked employees."
bty56h,"NTA. My grandmother has been bleeding my mother dry since my grandfather died 20 years ago, and continues to emotionally manipulate her out of money even after my own father died 3 years ago, all while having lived with various assholes. I wish I had the bravery to do what you're doing. It's difficult but I think it's fair."
bty7zl,"NTA

The fact that your family makes your mental health worse is the biggest red flag there is."
btyai7,"NTA, appears they weren’t looking out for you at all OP. Especially considering all of those women ticked boxes of deal breakers for you"
btyalw,"NTA, and also.. “he NEEDS to do this”?? He needs to make his loved one feel uncomfortable each and every day, even after being told to stop? Weird. I would break my SO something else in such situation.

He apparently doesn’t care much of your feelings, so I don’t see any reason for you to be sad about his wrist."
btyddr,NTA. Really whatever decision you make you’d be justified in. You wouldn’t be out of line to “get into it” with your mother either. Maybe ask her why she doesn’t respect your relationship? Because that’s a cold slap in the face and I think she knows it
btyfxg,"YTA. You don't have to make your daughter go to a christening, but they absolutely didn't schedule it that day ""out of spite."" They probably took whatever day the church wasn't already booked.

You're also making a christening sound like a way bigger deal than it is. A 7-year-old can behave in a church for half an hour. It's not a huge sacrifice. There's no reason it should ""totally overshadow her birthday."" You go, you come home, you have the party. Or don't go at all. But your anger over it is unwarranted."
btyl6n,NTA. You yelling in front of her child isn't any worse than her subjecting her child to participating in a scam.
btyow5,NTA. This is bizarre. Your mom sounds like a child.
btyvwg,"Nta-  this is a gym for women only.  Under no circumstance should a boy be allowed in the locker room.  Especially with an iPhone.  

OT.  How is this even allowed? I would have thought a women only gym would be sexually discriminatory."
btz50w,"YTA, you don't get along with one person, and you expect your friends to follow you, and cut ties with that one person. Life doesn't work that way. You can have multiple friends and those friends may not get along."
btz551,"NTA

A couple of *years*? That's some unreasonable anxiety right there. I think that is the only appropriate response."
btz5b8,"NTA. You have a desk job that requires you to be focused on your tasks. Listening to music helps a lot of people concentrate. In certain offices this is totally acceptable, usually in more relaxed environments with younger people. 

However, not so open minded people may think that you are trying to isolate yourself and that listening to music/ podcasts is a distraction for you, affecting the quality of your work. I do not agree with this though."
btzbfo,"NTA

Your account, your rules."
btzd2a,"NTA

Sounds like it's your friends problem to search for someone willing to buy the ticket and not yours. You were a convenience to begin with so why is there such an obligation all of a sudden?"
btzdab,"NAH, if their love is true let them be. You are not the asshole for acting cautiously though. I would have a sit down with them and a good lengthy talk about your reservations."
btzeip,"NTA, but I'd seriously consider not going either.  She didn't come to your wedding.  She's purposely excluding your wife despite the fact that they can keep things civil."
btzfeb,"NAH. You both agree to it, that’s all that matters. Kind of weird IMO to have her pay for her own engagement ring (although I agree $10k is kind of ridiculous for a ring), but to each their own. If you’re both okay with it I don’t see a problem. Let your mom and sister be irrationally mad, that’s their own decision.

Edit: Spelling"
btzj76,"NTA. You are an adult and as such, you get to decide (with your wife now) how you are going to be most comfortable dealing with your family."
btzmrn,"YTA - You knew that what you were doing wasn't going to be seen as 'ok' behaviour by your boss, so you lied and threw him under the bus to cover your own ass."
btzn4b,NTA. This is the time to set the tone for the levels of control you want this lady having in your life moving forward. No need to play along or it'll be the same old song and dance for the years to come (or until it escalates to something even more obnoxious).
btznff,"NTA

Honestly what the heck is wrong with your husband???? ""Oh no, my wife loves our child so much, how dare she be sad about the fact she doesn't get to spend much time with him..."" ????

The fact that he's angry that you get sad shows he just has zero empathy. He made it all about his poor hurt feelings that somehow you make him feel bad? because he gets to stay at home? Uh, that sounds more like his own insecurity at being a Stay at home dad."
btzr2b,"NAH.

30 minute lock out is reasonable and proportionate. Just because he has a disability, doesn't give him leave to damage your property.

He has to learn to handle himself, and if that involves a reasonable and proportionate reaction from you, so be it."
btzun5,"This should be a big ol can of none of your business.

I appreciate how that feels, and you don’t have to be his friend. You can stop seeing him. But making some moral preachings to him about this.. he knows what he’s doing."
bu027k,"Nope.  In my opinion, NTA. I am really sick of people using their own bad judgment as a fundraising opportunity.  But of course, other people are entitled to feel differently. As with all things, when you make a stand that goes against the herd, be prepared for the push back."
bu02ro,"NTA, of course. No neighbor ever asks or expects this of another.

And I'd make damn sure - absolutely sure - that the property line is where they're claiming it is. For that reason, I don't think it's even legal to just randomly build a fence like that without contacting a surveyor. Where I live, you can't just build structures on your property without the township being involved."
bu02x6,[deleted]
bu04ql,"Eh, NAH.

Someone wanted a more surface relationship with pleasantries, you wanted a deeper level of friendship that included lunch meet ups. There's nothing wrong with either of those things."
bu06po,"YTA.  Calling you an asshole is no where near strong enough of a word.  I cycle commute; people already like to shit on bikers without people doing stupid shit like this.  If you were on the road an a car passed you super close in an attempt to scare you off the road you'd be rightfully pissed off.  You are so much the asshole, I hope one of them tosses a stick in your spokes."
bu09fh,[deleted]
bu09pd,"NTA- he's deliberately provoking you. It's not the card or the gift that's a big deal, it's the doing it together. It's about the agreement you made together."
bu0bbq,NTA. Your friend was an extremely poor host.
bu0cn4,"NTA. *No one* is obligated to speak at a funeral, even the closest of loved ones. Everyone is there to grieve so no one normal would think it makes you any less of a person for not doing it, coupled with the anxiety about speaking that you laid out."
bu0eg2,YTA and you are getting advice from an asshole as well.  What kind of monster asks their husband to ignore a puppy so that it likes them better than the husband?  How little self-esteem do you have to have to request someone neglect a living thing just so you can feel that it likes you more.
bu0fgl,Yta -  for getting owned by an 8 year old.  Nice work skippy
bu0gyh,"YWBTA

she pays rent just like you and is entitled to have her window open. and idk if you all have AC or not but come summer, all of NYC is the devil's taint so you'd be a double asshole for expecting her to keep it closed during that time. the responsible thing to do here is go on amazon or go to target and find a screen solution for this window. for all of your windows, really.

also what kind of building has no screens on the 30th floor? call your building and tell them to install them."
bu0ic3,"YTA.

Not only are you the asshole, you come off as completely out of touch with reality. People listen to all kinds of music, there’s no way to know why they connect with it (beat, rhythm, lyrics, artist loyalty, etc), so to jump down someone’s throat for your outside view of what they’re listening to, comes off as batshit crazy. You are absolutely the asshole."
bu0ii4,"NTA    

Why is it that grandparents want to spoil the grandkids over & beyond what the parent feels is right?"
bu0jao,"NTA his friends caused damage to your property and began stealing from you. You were patient for too long tbh, it’s not unreasonable to want to know who’s coming into your home. You’re all paying a portion of rent and deserve to feel safe in your homes and know that your possessions will be where they were left."
bu0ljb,"NTA. Since your mom is the one facilitating this incessant gift-giving (from people you don't even know), and since the gifts in question are clearly for her benefit, perhaps she should be the one writing thank-you notes."
bu0lxh,"Buy a damn blanket and stop arguing over something so petty. Yta. You decided to move to the floor, not her."
bu0lyn,NTA- you dont owe others a pic just because your dressed up! And after he so rudely responded?! Doubly so!
bu0yvl,"NAH. You're trying to see her and she wants to see you.  All good things, even if it doesn't work out"
bu104t,NTA.  He gets angry when you are sad?  His lack of empathy is not your fault.  He needs to work on letting you emote whether he understands it or not.
bu14fp,"YTA it would take you barely any time. I doubt you'd be late because you stopped to take someone's picture. And your remark about the bodyguard was really, really uncalled for."
bu15w6,ESH. And for half your story I thought you were talking about an old person.
bu1h3a,"YTA

But mostly cuz teen romances get all of the awkward drama learning stuff out of the way before marriage is an option and by trying to rob her of that you stand a real risk of her getting tied down to a real jerk simply from coming from a sheltered background."
bu1lig,Info - whose car would you be taking?
bu1los,"NTA -  this is her problem,  if she can reach out to
You then she isn’t disabled beyond what is needed to find a replacement for her shift"
bu1mb5,NTA. You don't owe anyone any favors
bu1mzs,"YTA - you gave her a gift,  that’s no longer your property to give away"
bu1p0u,"NTA. He ran up that electric bill, he should pay his debts."
bu1rk0,"

bu1shv,"NTA -  it’s your driveway and the
Problem you encountered is exactly why people shouldn’t park there."
bu1ste,"1. It is always good to update your resume and know your options, good on you.
2. Management sucks, and is a natural course for anybody good at what they do, even if they suck at managing people.
3. Managing people sucks, we'll just leave it there.
4. NTA
Period."
bu1u3o,"NTA - It sounds like you two may have some communication/boundary issues to talk about, but he doesn't have ""dibs"" on you in any way. He's overreacting."
bu1u3y,NTA - Well Done! Do this to every idiot who sends you messages like that. And tell your friends and girlfriends to do this as well!!
bu1w2x,"Definitely NTA - your house, your choice who gets to stay there. Full stop. You don't necessarily have to be mean about it, but be firm that it's your decision and they're not welcome to just crash whenever."
bu21xs,NTA
bu22vt,"NAH. (Edited to reflect your response below.) You don't have to call out to walk her dogs (obv) but she doesn't need to be driving you the station every day, either. TBH, I don't think this is really about the dogs at all. Even if you took them out of the equation, you'd still have to take time off if she wanted to go on a trip (which she should be allowed to do). Might be time to move out and/or get a car. 

&#x200B;

INFO: You said if your mom doesn't go with the dad, you'd be walking the dogs with her anyway. Why would you have to take the day off from work to walk the dogs if she wasn't there?"
bu233h,"NTA

Ned is a freeloader and Bill now knows that Ned has the means to financially support himself if need be. There is nothing wrong with a parent telling their adult child, ""Pay up or get out."""
bu23df,"NTA, and your shit-stirring uncle needs to grow the heck up."
bu265s,"NTA
My brother just graduated, so I know how hard it is to get more tickets. It is not your fault."
bu26m0,"> I think that i'm not a racist because i wasn't trying to say anything hurtful even if it sounds like that

You're wrong, and YTA."
bu2765,"I dont think you can not return the company truck even if they owe you money without it being considered theft.

Work stoppage is different.  

I think this is a r/legaladvice scenario though because employment law varies so much and depends on what kind of contract you have etc etc etc"
bu29v6,"Very good example of validation seeking. You told him no shoes and he pouted outside like a child. Obviously not the asshole, dude."
bu2cis,"YTA.

For all four reasons.

Stay out of your sister's shit."
bu2eqd,Get a paternity test.
bu2eyr,"NTA. It's you brothers job and responsibility. Just because you're his family doesn't mean he, or anyone else for that matter, has the right to order you around."
bu2f0t,"NTA- You have your own life to deal with and you need prioritize it. If you feel a relationship isn’t good for you, it is definitely wise to end it."
bu2fjr,NTA for kicking him out after all the touching but I’m confused why you keep hanging out with him if what he wants to do and his interests bore you so awfully.
bu2fx2,"NAH They politely asked, you politely declined, they walked away. No asshole-ery going on here. Although, it is kind of a dick move to not take their picture when there was no one else around to ask. Oh well."
bu2g3m,"YTA

>I stole someones instagram account  
>  
>I stole someons fortnite account  
>  
>I even stole someones' fitbit account

The fact that someone makes it easy to steal from them does not justify stealing from them. The fuck is wrong with you?"
bu2i3o,"NAH:

You are not obligated to tell anyone except a long term partner, which you said you would plan to do.

There isn't anyone else involved in the equation if you keep it to yourself, so there is no one else to be an asshole , hence NAH."
bu2iie,"NTA and your mother is being a huge asshole.  ""You have to come, and you have to pay for yourself""  Fuck that.  

Time to speed up your move-out timeline.  I honestly feel for you, your step dad has pushed you to the side and really driven a wedge between your mother and you.  Hopefully once you move out and get established she will make time to repair your relationship and not take you for granted."
bu2ilx,"NTA, make the claim.  Also report to police."
bu2kf5,YTA why would you not want her to finish regular high school? What lesson are you imparting by being a pedantic stick in the mud?
bu2kfh,"NAH:

You are completely justified in not wanting it, and I also get where he is coming from. 

Is there a way to re-purpose it?  Use one of the stones or the band, to make a new, special ring? 

This is worth having a real conversation about, not assigning blame."
bu2mcf,"NTA.  She ended it, she can leave.

EDIT: Specifically working with the information given; she was spending more time outside of work with her co-worker than she was with you.  That can be really taxing on a relationship.  You are both on the lease, and she is the one who wants out.  You would not be the asshole for asserting your equal rights to the place, as you are an equal tenant. 

The big question is, why go through all that?  Just leave, block her on every device, and focus on your best damn life; leave her and her BS drama in that apartment."
bu2nvy,Low-grade YTA. You need to figure out how to conquer your mental challenges at some point and this seems as good a time as any. Your mom can’t drive you around forever.
bu2pz4,NTA. But it's kinda fucked that your GF is making you subject to her crazy mother. Your GF should tell her mom to take a hike.
bu2tmb,"> I want to live my life but I feel trapped under this roof. 

You're 22. Move out, then you can. NTA."
bu2ue4,"NTA honestly keeping your children away from her sounds like a healthy choice for them; and you.  

Going no or limited contact seems like a really smart choice.  Look into therapy if you have never tried it, it may help you process just how much they messed with your head."
bu2uuz,"NTA, what a stupid thing to get angry over."
bu2vay,I feel like we're missing a part of this story
bu2vrt,"NTA:

It's your paint, do what you want with it. Also, tbh it sounds like your mom has issues if she cried over that (unless you yelled at her or something and didn't include it in your post)."
bu2w4k,"YTA

he said he didn't want to be part of your roasting and you did it anyway. what did you expect?"
bu2w9w,"NTA. You handled the situation maturely, and she didn't"
bu2yrm,"NAH - just a case of very different upbringings. She probably shouldn't have been so insistent after you mentioned that it's part of your culture, but it can be hard to wrap your head around another society's norms when you aren't raised in it. It sounds like she meant well, and just didn't understand the significance you put on caring for your elders."
bu3055,"NTA. If a group goes in on a gift, they need to decide on that gift *together*. You can't be expected to chip in on something you didn't get a say on. I wouldn't tell her I thought it was ugly though. ""I bought a gift already. I won't be able to chip in on the necklace."" Should do it."
bu32kg,"NTA. Even if your Dad has forgiven her she sounds like a bad person, and just because she's your mother doesn't mean you need to associate with her.

On the anniversary party, I do think you should reconsider for the sake of your grandparents, even if you only stay for a little while."
bu33b1,"NTA but for fuck's sake, talk to your brother about it! Be an adult, have a discussion about your reasons not to do it and your reservations with his fiance. I *wish* my family had been willing to take me aside before my first marriage. Would have saved everyone involved."
bu33yp,"NTA and pretty sure what this person is asking would not be within your power to decide anyway. that's a decision for your employer to make. and they have made it - by giving you different contracts.

her lack of proper retirement planning is not your problem to solve."
bu35c4,"WNBTA

But the way she approaches it is key."
bu36b3,"Retired military here,  when you set your retirement date that’s it you are no longer deployable. Tours to the Mideast are generally around 11-12 months, although the needs of the service come first.  Usually you get at least a year between deployments(again needs of service come first). This guy is full of shit."
bu36xg,NTA - Politely knock on your new neighbors' door one evening and explain to them the whole visibility thing. Mention that it's kind of a neighborhood courtesy. They may just not know.
bu37lv,This is a lifetime movie plot
bu3aon,"NTA

It's actually pretty damn sexist to assume three women need a man to guide them to their cars, isn't it?

&#x200B;

That said, I personally think you should've just walked them to their cars, but that's just me."
bu3df0,ESH they suck for leaving their dog out all day and you suck for being petty about it. i'd hate to be one of the other neighbours who lives nearby and has to listen to this pointless pissing contest all day.
bu3gjw,"NTA. Boosting at all is a shitty af thing to do, and spending money for it is just stupid."
bu3h0r,[removed]
bu3j7w,NTA your dad's a dumbass who has made you be on a tax list. You're fucked.
bu3kiy,YTA- i mean it takes two minutes to write a letter
bu3p0m,"Well then. 

Theres a whole world I didnt know existed."
bu3tfu,"NTA

He didn't get a ticket, he got a DUI.  Totally justified; particularly a performance car.

There is nothing saying you can't get his something more practical later on when he proves he is mature enough not to drink and drive.  But in the meantime it sounds like he should be Ubering it anyway."
bu3u3k,NAH - she’s being a nosey/concerned parent and it wasn’t a big deal to you. No assholes here.
bu3u6f,"You're NTA for feeling angry.   Especially since he went and tried to pass it off to someone else without coming to you first.   Just try and avoid too many Asshole-ish things when you address this.   

You can't control your feelings, or we'd all be Assholes.   Just watch what you do with those feelings."
bu40o7,"NTA. You sound like you're behaving reasonably, and giving your ex plenty of advance notice and opportunity to make the situation palatable. If she will not give you an adult response, the problem lies with her."
bu41h0,NTA - they're getting hung up on wording and ignoring your good intent.
bu44i5,"> I need to clear up that they are infact trying to help me with my issue but only making it worse, and they took me to a bunch of doctors but none helped. 

NAH. They might think they're trying to help, but you need to let them know that it isn't helping. It sounds like they have your best interests in mind. Have a frank conversation about boundaries and see where it goes from there."
bu46e8,"NAH.  Then ya, taking a ""Take your work elsewhere"" is a power move that you're not really in a position to make.  Try talking to her sometime when she isn't working, maybe set up a small fridge and toaster oven in another part of the house would help."
bu4a5e,"NTA but damn, man. Counseling. You and your wife are NOT on the same page about parenting this kid, and he obviously needs some sort of consistent structure and discipline."
bu4auf,"NTA. Their behaviour is unacceptable. Yes, you were blunt and it’s a hard decision to make for your wife, but *it’s your child*. 

They upset your wife and expect you to apologise for it, they don’t sound like good sisters to me. 

They have no business in how you raise your child, or how you spend your time. That older SIL sounds like one of the JNSILs of r/justnomil."
bu4ay0,"NTA - your body, your choice."
bu4l4e,"It's be easier on the child and the childs mother to keep them overnight, but if it's more difficult for you then feel free to ask them to get the child at midnight. You're doing them a favor.  Beggars can't be choosers.  NAH"
bu4lu5,"ESH

bu4pla,YTA. It is NOT up to you to decide how she should feel about being harassed on the street. Take her at her word that she’s uncomfortable. Thinking that she’s being a “drama queen” is exactly the kind of thinking that lets people escalate their harassment and hurt people.
bu4s7p,"You are so far from being an asshole. I just want to give you a hug, I’m going through the same with my own mother."
bu4tb8,NTA. You are allowed to stop playing whenever you want and he's just a sore loser. If you play again and win again he's just going to keep asking for double or nothing until he wins a game.
bu4tla,"YTA. She’s your ex, so it’s not up to you who she hangs out with. You’re within your rights not to see her, but you can’t tell others what to do. 

On another note, all this hanging around for her seems to be doing a number on you. Perhaps cutting her loose will free you up to move on."
bu4ugr,"YTA -- But you only have so much of a choice to be. You've missed every performance, game, and ceremony. You hired a trained sitter for this event but didn't trust them enough and stayed yourself. Your daughter has it hard enough not having a dad to come to any of her events, but she never had a mom there either. 

It sounds like she's always been second hand to her brother, which is incredibly understanding at times, but you haven't made enough effort to find someone who could atleast handle him for *one* night. She's your kid too. She still needs her mom at these events, she still needs her mom to show her support, not just tell her. 

Also, this wasn't the first time you didn't show up, she cut you off because you *never* showed up. You can only expect her to go through that disappointment so many times."
bu4vvu,"technically YTA but in this case, you're an asshole i support through and through"
bu4vzx,"NTA, you need to talk to your parents about this. They have no responsibility to support you, but you have every reason to be upset that this is how they spend their money now. Is there some barrier to you getting a job? You mentioned a bad economy but as a 24 year old you should be thinking about making money so that you can fix your own problems and buy your own stuff: I can imagine it would be terribly frustrating seeing your brother in branded clothes with new gaming systems and laptops tho that sucks ass."
bu4yuu,"YTA. Would have been totally fine to tell him in private, but that must have been quite humiliating for him. That's not the kind of stuff you should bring out in public"

>She'd sit in her room when I was around. Would barely talk to me. Just made me feel bad in general and would give obviously bullshit reasons.

She's also not obligated to hang around you and talk to you all the time, she probably felt uncomfortable for you telling her you like her friend and banning her from coming over cause she doesnt like you back.

>I guess but she freaked out on me when I asked her for money she still owed me ($150). She told me she already paid me back (she didn't)

\- After you were clearly and visibly upset about the previous two things, your parents continued to make fun of you for being upset

Yeah, no. I might be biased because my #1 pet peeve is being annoyed intentionally, but wow. This just sounds like a really mean-spirited move by your parents.

Her job is important to her and she likely takes it just as seriously as you take your job. It doesn't ""make her happy and give her confidence."" It's her job and she takes pride in it. It doesn't matter if it's part time (I'm sure she'd make it full time if she wasn't busy being, you know, a student). It matters to her and she wanted to go to that meeting to improve herself and her performance at her job.

You basically said her time was worth less than yours. On paper, maybe it's true. But in practice, you'll have trouble keeping a relationship saying things like that. No one wants to feel undervalued by the person they love."

If it's really that bad you might be able to politely bring it up (although i'm not sure HOW you would even say that politely). But it would make you an asshole, and you don't know what possible medical condition or disability he might have.

You insulted her horribly during an exam. You knew, KNEW, that she would be able to hear you. You were sitting right behind her in a quiet room. There is no way you didn't know that she would hear you. Why did you have to say it at all? If you were distracted that badly, just ask to move without stating the exact reason or make something up.

Going around the Prof. to the ombudsman and the dean would be kind of an assholish move. Sometimes people go through phases during their college life.

Your sister isn't the asshole here either.

Your parents have two amazing academic children. Who are passionate about school. Instead of being grateful for that (they're so lucky!). They berate your sister who is still one of the top ten. That's huge! And pit her against you.

This shouldn't be your responsibility, because your parents know better than to torture your sister like this. However, if you do what I suggest, I think it would mean worlds to your sister.

Next time they berate your sister, and everytime they do it. Defend her. Make sure to keep doing this, especially when your sister is around.

""She is still one of the top 10 out of X students."" The top 10 are all extremely close to each other in marks. It's a matter of a few different grades on a few different tests. She is still one of the best. I am only the best in this school. She is immensely talented in X, Y, Z. That I couldn't dream of being better at her in. It really upsets me when you compare us, because she is incredibly smart and talented. You comparing us is also ruining our sisterly bond by making us feel like we should compete against each other. When we should be focusing on strengthening our sisterly bond. Please stop comparing us.""

Secondly you need to get over your disgust for periods. When you get a long term gf (unless you bat for the other team, no shame) your gonna have to get used to it. Especially when you two live together. 

I NAH solution would be to offer to trade the chore with your sister or mother. Instead of emptying the bin you can enoty the dishes or or something else.

I’m trying to figure out this phone prank thing you were doing. What was the point of it? To get your new number blocked by all your friends?

It also sounds like she never had your number before, which does make it kind of creepy.

The weed part... that whole thing is bizarre and the dots don’t fully connect here, but I don’t see anything wrong in terms of everyone being adults. You don’t need your friends permission to perform a transaction with his adult sister, but I’m not sure if that should be some big secret either."

buf7ff,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

This story probably isn't that dramatic, but I really want to know whether or not I'm the asshole.

My grandfather's 90th birthday is in a few days and his children want to give him a special gift per his request; a written account of his life with his family.

For this gift, my father (the son in law) did the research, interviews, and writing. In finalizing the draft, my mother (the daughter) worked on the credits. She credited my father as having done all ""research and editing,"" but my father believes he should have been credited as ""writer.""

I think that this issue is small enough that he really shouldn't care. Besides that, it's my Grandfather's gift and his life being celebrated, but my father, ""on principal,"" continually insisted day after day on making the changes (even during and after the printing process). Eventually, we drove to the printers, after the story had been printed, and had them change it by hand.

The entire time, my mother has been feeling like TA and would continually apologize to my father who refused to stop guilting her until the 'issue' was resolved.

I intervened on her behalf several times; whenever my dad started trying to guilt her and she would say,""is it really that big a deal?"" I would contradict my father and insist that it wasn't and that my father was being ridiculous. This prompted my father to snap at me each time with things like ""keep your ass out of it.""

Am I the asshole for intervening? Should I have stayed out of it?

Last note: I have anxiety which acts up whenever my parents argue even about small issues which makes me more prone to react negatively to whoever is starting or perpetuating the argument, which is making me wonder whether or not I'm biased.

ETA: Where your partner becomes the asshole is when they try to enforce an identity upon you.  Granted, they aren't wrong that that enforced identity would match up better with the way they self-identify, but you aren't trying to get them to self-identify as a woman so that you ""feel better"" about identifying as a lesbian.  That crucial distinction between the way you want to resolve this issue is what makes your partner the asshole here."
buizvd,"YTA.  You're knocking boots and your parents can hear you.  Be more discreet. If the bed is noisy then use a counter or in the shower.  Go for a drive and find a secluded spot, rent a room, etc. Just don't let them hear you, and if they do apologize and say your passion got the best of you and you're sorry"

>I have made it a habit when I’m driving past someone at these scenarios I get real mad if they start to turn before I cross

Break that habit.  

>I have borderline personality disorder, one of the key aspects of that is low/nonexistent impulse control. I am well aware that besides the potential of being an asshole, that when I do this I am putting myself and potentially other drivers at risk. 

The BPD is an explanation, but not an excuse.  You *know* losing your cool is dangerous, but you've made it a habit, to use your own words.

> This is in the states btw so guns are a concern. I don’t carry a firearm but I do carry knives.

Stop carrying knives until your impulse issues are under control, and remember that a car is also a weapon."

YTA 


You made the final decision. You handed over your dogs without checking into this courier service.    One that was covered in red flags.   1)No service that drives across the country is cheap.   2) doesn’t background check the dog but willing to take care of it for the minimum two days it takes to drive across the country with an animal.   3) could agree to deliver across the country that same day

Edit: 4) your mom got updates on your dogs but not you?   The fuck? 


You made that choice.   Your decisions and your actions are what put your dogs in danger.   You are responsible for them. Not your mom"
bujlke,"NTA.  You agreed to $600/month for six months.  Since they have dramatically increased their time at your house, it's reasonable for you to ask for more money to help cover the actual cost of them living there."
bujlqq,"I think NAH. You're not TA because no one has paid for or booked anything, and you gave them two choices as to how to proceed. However, your friend is right and it IS difficult to get 10 people to agree on a date, and if one person flaking leads to everyone flaking is a pattern of behavior for your group, I can see why she is frustrated. I do think you did well by trying to compromise though."
bujq5h,"NAH. I personally think it is tacky, but it seems like it’s a cultural thing. If this is typical of where you live, they’re not assholes for doing it.       
You can’t blame someone for doing something that is socially and culturally acceptable.      
However, you also don’t need to get behind it.        
I’d just move on with my life and ignore the subject unless specifically asked for my opinion cause calling people tacky for something everyone does is a shit move."
bujryx,"ESH. Don't punish your kid for your ex's failures. Take him to court if necessary for the unpaid child support. You can seek adjustment to custody agreements if you want, but I don't think a family court would look kindly on you withholding access to the child (which is unlikely to be considered in the best interests of the child) over money. The money is important so pursue it the proper way."

bulosb,"YTA

The neighbours had the decency to clear the party with her beforehand. It is unfortunate that she forgot about it and it fell on a night when you were staying over but you did have the opportunity to go home. 

Not only did you go against her wishes but you have probably made things really awkward for her with her neighbours."
bulpgd,"YTA. I could almost understand if you found it a great home and explained to your ex that the dog was miserable or something but you DROPPED IT OFF AT A SHELTER. who knows how long it will take for it to get adopted, especially if it’s high energy. So instead of sitting in the house every day for 10 hours and at least having someone come home to it, it gets to spend 23 hours in a cage by itself, maybe one hour outside or with a trainer if the shelter can afford it. 

It was shitty for your ex to put you in this position but you could have worked together to find a solution (a friend to take the dog for 9 months, having your ex come stay with the dog while you’re at work, having your ex pay for a sitter, etc). There were options, you were just lazy and didn’t feel like dealing with it."
bulpuj,"Situation Sucks.

You can't always have all the relationships you want.

People that divorce also find that they can't keep all their friends.

You are being an asshole to yourself more than anything else. How on earth is it going to help your anxiety to find out that someone is talking shit about you? 

If someone does talk shit about you what will you do with that knowledge? You can't confront anyone without explaining that you were spying. Sometimes it is best just not to know."
bum7yj,YTA that’s his kid. She’s probably horrible because she can feel how much you hate her.
bumanq,Trust your instincts. It sounds like they're both already suffering. You know what they need better than anybody. The heartbreak would prolly kill the one left alive even if current illnesses don't.

This is for her own good, so fuck off or move out? Really? 

I worked with a few folks that retired and I recall a lot of them talking about how their doctors encouraged them to wait to get their back surgery done because it doesn't last forever. At some point it'll get bad again.

bumnra,YTA and maybe a little dumb
bumpij,"YTA. Just because he hasn’t thrown up in front of you doesn’t mean that he is lying to you about his condition. Based on the context you provided, I think that you are expecting him to drive you, rather than asking him. If he doesn’t want to drive or doesn’t feel comfortable driving, don’t make him drive.  On the other hand, I do understand that you are an insomniac and that the parking is expensive. 

You should consider seeing a sleep disorder specialist, if you don’t have one already. You should also help your boyfriend get help too. While none of the options are exactly ideal, I suggest that you should try to take the bus as much as possible and drive yourself when you can. If you ASK your boyfriend to drive you and he says yes, then that’s fine too. If possible, you could also consider biking to work."
bumpka,"NTA, but if you file the claim and your car is not worth much more than the repair, they will total it out anyway. So you might have a car payment either way."

However, you did scream in her face, ruin some of the groceries, and lock your friend out of the house (even if only briefly).  She has reason to be upset with you, especially because your post doesn't seem to suggest that you apologized to her.

If I were in your position I would pay your friend back for the eggs, apologize, and try to control your reaction to seeing an unexpected wasp a little better in the future."

bun1fm,"ESH.

She shouldn't have gone through your phone and I would definitely not continue a relationship with someone who does that.

In the same vein, you also didn't bring up that conversation because like you said, you knew she'd be jealous.

 She's more of an asshole here, but not enough to give a full NTA because I think you knew what you were doing otherwise you'd have brought it up sooner."
bun5hv,"NTA she could have at least offered gas money. An extra 15–20 min uses a lot of gas for seven straight days. She was trying to take advantage of you being nice and it backfired. You’re in no way required to drive her, you’re not a fucking taxi."
bun5in,"NTA. But honestly, you and your best friend aren't 21. This means your boyfriend is the odd man out. He can drink, and none of you can. That being said, you could easily turn into the asshole if your house becomes the cool house to smoke weed at and drink, which, letting younger teenagers who are most likely still in high school, will turn it into. So, basically, I'm gonna say, you're not the asshole, but you're pushing it. And fyi, don't think you're being a cool adult by letting teenagers smoke and drink, you're being an irresponsible adult, and being irresponsible has it's consequences. 

This is going to sound patronizing, but you need to focus on being a responsible adult, which means going to college/work, and paying your bills. Do not let yourself become the cool house where teenagers come over and smoke weed and drink beer, that shit will bite you in the ass fast, and you will get busted by the cops. Teenagers are young and dumb, and one stupid turd will get caught, and roll on you guys fast. If you plan on growing weed, it's going to make shit a whole lot worse of you get busted by the cops. Remember, the easiest way to not get in trouble is to not do anything to get in trouble. I repeat, do not become the cool house, you will have at most 6 months before you get arrested because some dumb teenager got caught and blabbed to his parents, or worse, a teenager fucks up and gets hurt, then it's way fucking worse."

If I had to guess, I'd say that your boyfriend has had his cat since it was a kitten. There's very little that you can do to change the way the cat behaves because from its point of view you're an unwelcome addition to the household."

My sweetheart Molly got sick suddenly and passed away within 48 hours 24 hours before that she was running and playing no sign of being sick at all. 

If you love that dog you'll let your grandpa register him so he can get a checkup. Talk with your grandparents about how you still want him to be your dog and that once you're financially stable again you will want to take him.  Sickness in dogs is unpredictable and if something goes wrong and your grandpa can't take him to the vet that will be on you because you don't want to ""give him away"""

Maybe say you didn't mind covering half. Show your appreciate to them by paying them back. That's how friendships stay health, otherwise it just causes problems like it did here. If you never wanted to show appreciation back, then absolutely insist you don't want them to pay for you because you didn't want to feel like you owe them."

She just seems like a proud mama. It's embarrassing but it's not vindictive.

Your friend should’ve DEFINITELY known better, it was stupid of him to take his expensive glasses.

She's already doing the job for free and he expects her to waste her money traveling to the wedding location and to get a hotel to stay at? 
No way. 

He could have even offered to pay for a hotel room for one night if he was inconvenienced with her staying at their house.  
One night at a hotel is still way cheaper than paying $10,000. 

She was doing him a favor and he also told your friend that she should be happy to help or not go, so she decided not to."
bupock,NTA - you aren't the asshole for not wanting to commit fraud over a small amount of money spent recreationally.
bupp9y,"I'm going to go with YTA on a technicality here.  


You're right with your reasoning.  It's not a big deal to simply retake a photo **provided of course** that something special isn't going by, like a water explosion from a log flume ride or a monorail whizzing by.  And in fact, in the situation where there simply isn't room to walk around a family blocking off a path to take a photo of some static structure, you wouldn't be an asshole at all.  They would be because there's no way for you to get around them.  


But most of the time, it's not really inconvenient to just walk around people.  These people are trying to make something special for them and just have no real situational awareness.  


You, on the other hand, are actively participating in ruining their experience because you can't be bothered to go around them, and then you're doing mental gymnastics to justify it where a lot of people probably don't put this much thought into being a passive nuisance.  *This is basically the sign of an asshole*.  Had you just been doing it and had this weird thought after the fact, I'd say 100% NTA.  ""**But it is my personal practice...**"" is what changes everything.  


And again, I'm not referring to any situation where a path is completely blocked off.  It's unreasonable to expect you to stop and wait.  It's not unreasonable to expect you to just walk around."

What you did was very manipulative.

Not a big one, but a teenage one. And coming from a former teenage asshole I get it. 

&#x200B;

You threatened him out of anger over an argument and continued to double-down, rather than realizing you said it out of anger. That's what made you the asshole. The mature thing to do would have been to realize you were angry and, due to that anger, becoming irrational, and then walk away.

&#x200B;

But that's life, and it takes years of practice to do learn that and to put it into practice. Adults often forget what it's like being a teenager because we look back at those times with additional years of life experiences. As a teenager, it's hard to see that because right now, these are the big issues in your life. You have every right to feel the way you feel as you learn to deal with these issues. 

&#x200B;

Your dad knew you said this out of anger, but respected your decision anyways, and you should respect that he did that. Use this as a learning experience on how to handle your feelings.  Learn to walk away or disengage BEFORE you say something out of anger. And if you do say something out of anger, learn to recognize that and learn to apologize when you've cooled down. You'll have a lifetime to put this in to practice, but the sooner you do, the sooner you stop inadvertently hurt someone else."

Dear Parents:  it is 100% **your** responsibility to let **others** know if **your** child has allergies.  It is **not** anyone **else's** responsibility to badger every single person they know with kids to figure out which ones have allergies and which ones don't.  Also, it doesn't matter if you already told someone--you remind them because, again, it's not their responsibility to keep track of everyone who has allergies.  If you don't say something, go ask your spouse or someone else relevant if they said anything.  If no warning was given, you have no right to get angry.

There's no need to bring it up again. If you don't like her, then stop including her in your group chats. There's no need to contact her just to attack her AGAIN for not being supportive.

buydi8,"YTA. Your brother set reasonable boundaries and asked you to respect them. It wasn't like he applied this rule to every mug in the house. He specifically bought two mugs for himself and was even willing to share them. Even if you don't understand his preferences, they're clearly important to him and aren't extreme. It wouldn't have been that difficult to go without tea once or wash a dirty mug by hand, but you selfishly ignored his boundaries.

>I said his rule was ridiculous and it's a curtourtsy that I respect it at all. 

That's a very self-centered thing to say. Thinking that someone's boundaries are ridiculous doesn't give you a free pass to step all over them. If that were true, then it means your brother could violate your boundaries whenever he wanted, just because he believes they're stupid."

*=your dad isn’t an asshole per se, it just sucks that when it comes to financial promises he doesn’t pull through. 

When I asked if your father had any drinks, I assumed I would say he’s the asshole if you said he was sober. However, after reading your post again, it sounds like you’re the star child. You don’t need help like your sister needs help; maybe that’s how your dad might see it. 

Perhaps he had every intention to do these things he offered, but your sister ended up draining his pocket for rent money. Clearly rent is more important than making sure your car doesn’t smell like gym clothes, or fix up minor car damage (though it does suck even more that he caused the damage). 

That might not sound fair to you at all, but no one wants to see their daughter struggle. 

All of that said, it wouldn’t make you the asshole for asking for him to hold true to that offer either, especially if you explain your need for a safety net. He’ll likely support your choice and want to help.

That said, you are also allowed to have your boundaries and preferences, but they shouldn't be more important than someone else's.

The thing is, the behavior you described is abusive on an objective level. JFC, you had to go to therapy to stop her from touching you. You can dislike people for whatever reason, but in this case, I'm not sure there are people who would ""like"" her if they knew the extent of it. I sincerely hope it doesn't get worse and that when you're an adult, you can move out so you don't have to go through this mental torture with her. Sending you good vibes and prayers, OP."

bvbxxr,"YTA: 13 years?! This dog is already a dead-dog-walking.

They don't live more than about 10-14 years, and this one is already 13 years old. They are mortal beings. It is practically inevitable that a person will outlive their dog, and part of getting a dog is accepting that it *will* die, no matter how much money you throw down the toilet trying to stave off the inexorable end. 

It is for your mother to decide how much she is willing to spend on medical interventions to keep her dog alive and no one else. What she probably *ought* to do is have Snickers put to sleep.

But it's not your dog, and it's not your decision.

I would say ESH, you guys need to talk. You yourself admitted your mum didn't like the chocolate in the kitchen and then you guys forgot to take it up to your rooms.

Im glad your dog is OK, I don't know anything about pets but I guess you should still have him checked out.

I understand you want it to be a surprise, but you haven’t been around long enough to make a huge move like excluding a family member, a parent, no less, when they haven’t been excluded before. That could cause enormous issues with BF and his parents, having to explain to them why you thought he didn’t want stepdad to be there. And if this is your forever BF, it would also cause huge issues with your future in laws going forward. It’s too big of a move to make without input.

For you to not get that, you're not a very good friend. 
I get that you think you've done him lots of favors, etc. so he should do you this favor in return. And I get that you're disappointed. But then you acted like a child asking for your mower back.

He'll say it's a one time exception, but then it turns into two and then he's back to his old ways. This has happened many times.

You have multiple clear examples of him breaking his word, you are extremely valid in not trusting him. Because of this past, I'd honestly suggest counseling (AA maybe) to get him to curb his drinking. 6+ beers a night almost every night is a lot, especially for work days."

bvh33v,"Yay, this is a good one!

Let's see.  You were not without blame here insofar as you just took your daughter at her word without making any inquiries.  I mean it sounds like you didn't ask her a single ""Wait, what?"" kind of question when she said she's getting a tattoo.  And your title with quotes around 'allowing' isn't great since you're suggesting you didn't allow it but rather were misled into allowing it, and that's not taking proper responsibility for what happened here.

Given the broader context you describe, though, it seems like that tattoo was gonna be happening one way or the other, either here with a trusted artist or once daughter moves away to college.  On balance I'm going to say **NTA**.  Wife sounds like she is overreacting under the circumstances."

You sound like a cold person. Why can't you empathize with your daughter? I doubt very much that you had the composure and perspective at 13 that you claimed to. All of these feelings are huge and new to her, and she's swamped with hormones for the first time in her life as well. It's a LOT, and to be expected to suck it up and deal (for...what, exactly? So she doesn't inconvenience you with her emotions..?) is unhealthy and borderline emotionally abusive on your part.

It’s wholly inappropriate and it’s definitely meritted for you to be upset about the lack of boundaries. 

That said, unless this is sort of the norm for you, I’d say wait until things die down and try to have a calm conversation with your mother about it. It’s possible that she’s just oblivious and it didn’t occur to her that you would be upset. It may not be malice, and she may be defensive because you called her out on it.

If this isn’t a pattern, it may be a correctable one-off.

bvmrbl,"YTA. ~~I don’t know my feelings as to whether or not they a a part of the LGBTQ+ community specifically~~, but asexual people often *do* have to come out. Sex is SUCH a huge part of society and culture and so on and it is incredibly difficult to insist that it isn’t your thing when everyone is shoving sex down your throat. Asexual people can also still be attracted to people of the same gender (minus sexual attraction), which in my opinion would undoubtedly make them a part of the community.

Either way, being asexual is tough. Maybe in different ways than being gay, but it’s fucking hard. Asexual pride makes perfect sense to me.

Edit: and it’s not only partners that asexuals have to come out to. Friends and family and doctors may also pressure asexuals about sex and sexual activity. And for those who are sex repulsed, that could be pretty damn unpleasant even more so.

Edit part 2: I personally feel asexuals belong in the community but there is a lot of disagreement about this"

&#x200B;

If it was me, I'd just suck it up and deal with it. It doesn't sound like a big enough deal to make an issue out of. But at the same time you need to have a conversation with your wife and explain how you REALLY do just want a weekend with the two of you. For extra brownie points maybe even organise a cheap weekend away for just the two of you somewhere - it'll get you the weekend you want and hopefully also show her how good a quiet weekend with just the two of you can be."

I bet your ass he’s going to use condoms after the punishment is over.

He doesn't have one big happy family the day he left. I understand why he wants this and that he asked, but things aren't that cut and dry, and he needs to accept that you are all adults now and can make choices."
bvopuc,"NTA. It's not that you don't want to see them, it's that this was a friend holiday, so they're intentionally misreading the situation after deceiving you. Plus, this also affects your friends. That's not cool."
bvor6x,"YTA if you did this, yes. She screwed you, but it's over now so I suggest moving on. Her bakery doesn't care."
bvou9n,"ESH. That’s super annoying and I can understand why you’d be angry enough to leave the mess. But next time, just try saying “I’m really sick, please leave me alone” or something.

bvoynz,"NTA but considering they felt entitled to the jewellery, I suggest you lock up any gems you have lying around."
bvp201,"NTA, but you should have been clearer at the outset and said ""Even if you sign up for both, I will only pay for half the internet and nothing else, so make your decision accordingly."" If you've been paying for eight months, you need to tell her that she has one billing cycle to cancel and then *after that* you can stop paying without being an asshole. But I think paying for eight months like you've accepted things as they are and then suddenly not paying is an asshole move."
bvp2m5,"NTA, the ocean is big, her kids could drift on somewhere else. Her day and happiness isnt more important than yours."
bvp2nd,NTA. She shouldn't have put your business out there for the world to hear. Sounds like a HIPAA violation to me.
bvp6vg,"NTA. I work in HR, you're in a window where you can just tell them it's not a good fit. If they're week to week scheduling just tell them you'll work the remainder of the schedule (if you can) and that'll be it."
bvpfxi,"NTA. It’s generally bad form to insult your volunteers, if you ever want to have volunteers again.

Besides, a simple “If you haven’t heard anything in 48 hours please let us know” would suffice."

i’d like to add that your tone throughout the post is very off putting."
bvpkoq,"NTA

He’s 6, not 3. I’m sorry, but I don’t blame you for yelling at the kid since he keeps stealing your stuff. The parents need to teach him that it isn’t right because if they keep babying him he will think he can get away with it."
bvpnm7,NAH.  Also keep in mind these were exchanged as *gifts* so he isn't an asshole if he decides to keep it (not that I see him having any major issues with returning it).
bvpp6n,"Presumably he doesn't catch on if you change the subject/look blank/change the subject? If you do those things and he still doesn't get it I don't think you'd be TA of you gently told him you're not particularly interested in Eve. Alternatively, if it's only once a month and it makes him happy to tell you I'd probably just let him. I might have a more lenient perspective on this though because my grandma likes to tell me about everyone she's ever known even if I have no clue who they are, and I'd never ever let on to her that I'm actually bored to death!"
bvpphx,"NAH, but try to empathize with her a little. She is pretty clearly doing pretty bad in general; losing friends might be a big deal for her, especially if she is cutting. Do what you need to do, but consider working on the friendship, set good boundaries, etc. Good luck."
bvpssz,"NTA. She lived there, she should pay rent."
bvptm4,"NAH.  If it didn't work out, you don't need to keep trying to be 'friends' if you're not happy with that."

bvq2u2,YTA. You ARE trying to create a loveless sexless marriage but he can't point that out? Sex is a huge part of a healthy loving relationship like marriage. What's the difference between having a bff vs a husband? Sex.
bvq3af,"ESH. Blind guy cannot expect in a busy subway that Mozes clears a path for him . In a public street where's there's room obviously you should just move over for a blind person, but in a subway? He shouldn't have gotten angry.

You should've just left it at a sorry and move on, being blind and trying to navigate a Subway is also quite stressful."
bvq3ks,NTA- she obviously doesn’t value your time. And size 12 flip flops for yard work? Sure. If she has feet the size of big foot. This chick sounds like she’s just playing games with you and/or using you.

bvqjcc,"NAH - is she aware of the way you actually feel about taking photos?  I think she means well...She might think you are just a typical teenager that is annoyed by photos when actually there’s a bit more to it since you seem to have some stressful feelings associated with taking the photos.

Edit: spelling"
bvqjia,"NTA. It's heartbreaking that you need the Internet to tell you that. Your boyfriend is selfish and cruel. He's making no effort to understand your situation or medical condition, and every effort to disrespect you by pressuring you to put his boner first."
bvqjxg,NTA. A company that essentially punishes you for someone else's mistake is not a company you want to work for.

bvqtm6,"NAH. It seems like miscommunication, I would still tell them about your party so that way they don't think you're TA for just not showing up."
bvqvpl,I would like to know this too. It sounds like she’s pissed that she leant you money and is hoping you’ll pay it back.
bvqyou,"YTA sorry but you told them you'd do one thing and then did another, why is that any different than saying you'd show up to an event and then not? Make a promise, keep a promise."
bvr1aq,"NTA. Had a boyfriend like this who assumed he was welcomed everywhere I was invited and often “self-invited” himself, after the relationship ended I got earfuls about how annoying that was from friends (and I was definitely annoyed about it during the relationship too) and regret not having more of a spine. 

From the other side, I have thrown parties where a friend of a friend that I’ve never met before, brought his girlfriend who was not explicitly invited. As a host I didn’t appreciate this, even though it was just a casual party"
bvr1hr,"INFO: Will your manager personally care for your situation? Or does she just treat it as a regular off day or emergency day? 


I'd say YTA for lying but if the graduation party was worth it to you, live with the guilt. If it hurts you that much, find a way to come clean and compensate?"
bvr1uc,"NTA.
I get why she would hide it *at first* but it just doesn't sit right with me that she waited so long.
It's ultimately going to be up to your gf to kick her out but I don't think you should feel bad telling her that it would make you more comfortable if she did kick her out. It's not healthy for your gf or that ex for so many reasons, and it's not your job to feel guilt for that ex if she were kicked out. Like you said she's not paying anything to stay there."
bvr1z2,"ESH she shouldnt be so stubborn and probs not a good idea to make fun of your gf's mum.

Low key though I thought it was funny."

bvr6ak,"NTA.

You probably should have cut him off quite a while ago."
bvr7to,"NAH. (Between you and your grandma, your dad is the asshole)

She has to understand how he has affected you. It's between you and your dad, and she has to understand she can't change that. She needs to know what his behaviour was like towards you and understand that he can't do that as a parent and she wouldn't expect him to behave as such towards you."
bvr9of,"NTA

There are no hard and fast rules about two weeks notice. You're okay on this one. It's a temp job."
bvrcsc,"If you had *known* you were supposed to tip and didn't then I would say YTA. I'm covered in tattoos and tip every time but I've come across tons of people who simply aren't aware that there is a custom to tip. I would just talk to your artist. Say something like, ""hey I know this might be awkward but I haven't been tipping you and I honestly had no idea that was a thing"" and then just ask her what her preference is moving forward. NAH."
bvrd58,NTA. That’s some weird-ass entitled shit on the birthday kid’s mother’s part.
bvrdb0,NTA. It wasn’t a shift you were scheduled for so you weren’t obligated to take it even if you wanted to sit home and watch paint dry. Tell your brother to stick it.
bvrdew,"NTA. If that helps you move on and cope you have to do what’s best for you. If she has found someone, it is probably best to give her space. Try to be respectful of their relationship. I know it sucks, man. I’m sorry."
bvriaq,"NAH except perhaps your stepmom... I agree that her father is a grown man, and should let someone know if he’s hungry... 

Does your father typically make meals for anyone else, or is it always your stepmom? I can’t find fault in someone losing track of time while working hard for their family and overlooking a meal..."

bvrnv5,"Put it in a box in your closet, or under your bed. Giving it back might hurt her feelings and throwing it away might hurt your conscience."
bvrogn,NAH but what would be the issue with asking if they want a smoothie too? You don't have to (and likely should not) put protein in theirs. They'll probably say no anyway... IME its always polite to ask if anyone wants anything if you are going to the kitchen to make food or get a drink.

bvrr01,"NTA

Honestly, clarifying the dress code is a really good idea. I wish more invites did it. 

Because: ""semi-formal dress"", what the fuck does that mean? I could see that meaning a nice dress shirt and jeans."
bvrspq,"NTA.

You've independently paid off your student fees and they can't even spare $50? Don't even seem like your parents at all, considering they are able but won't spare that $200. No reason for them to be upset at all lol"
bvrsyi,"NTA. Asking you not to be friends with someone isn't appropriate, in most circumstances.  If you had cheated with the person, or it was someone who had really hurt your SO, maybe, but mostly, controlling your friendships is a red flag."
bvrt2l,"I'm going with YTA for the delivery. He was trying to be helpful. I get why it was annoying, but I doubt he was insinuating that you are a moron. A simple, ""I think I've got it! Thanks though"" would've sufficed."
bvrt9q,"I'd never wanna work for a manager that would plot to demote someone while they were on vacation before they ever even got to see how good of an employee that person was. Like yeah, manager should be grateful to OP for the help when they were coming on bit they shouldn't shaft other employees without cause."
bvrtkp,"YTA.  It’s fair to tell her to start saving, since that’s the responsible thing to do anyway.  But why’d you have to be so *mean* about it?"
bvrunw,NAH...but situational awareness goes a long way. Next time someone might go even crazier if they think you are taking snaps of their kiddos.
bvrup3,"NTA.

It's all fun and games until the game is pushed too far. It's a good wake-up call for him to stop and your actions are justified with intent of the better."
bvrvup,"2-3 times a year?  Yeah, YTA.  I mean, sure, 16-year-olds arguably don’t need that much babysitting, but it’ll be a moot point in two years tops.  Some people *like* their family, you know?  Other people would consider that a plus in a partner.  Just ... you seem really selfish here."
bvrwxh,"NTA 

If you don't want a kiss, she should respect that. Simple as that. I bet if you flipped this situation around where your trying to kiss her without her permission, she'd charge you with sexual harrassment lol"
bvs0ow,"NTA, but you should be able to be honest.  You are 18, you can make your own decisions. I would rather you are a good person who isn't church going vs. a bad person who attends.... religiously."
bvs3y3,"NTA, his feelings don't constitute ""dibs"". He doesn't get to ""grant permission"" on who she or you can date"
bvsaup,NTA I cant stand when ppl think you owe them weed just bc you both smoke this used to happen to me at parties and it got th the point where me and another guy would just go to another room and lock the door bc otherwise every mf would show up
bvsc0l,"NAH. You may biologically be her father, but the mother selected your sperm, knowing that it this does not come with a father for said child."
bvsc5e,YTA the party is about her baby. Don’t steal her spot light. Wait a week
bvsd1l,"Why the absolute fuck would you go on an expensive vacation when you're struggling financially? 

ESH. You for your stupidity. Her for hers + going back on her word."
bvsfv5,YTA sorry but no your Therapist has no responsibility to you not see your dad's girlfriend and it's weird you think she does.
bvshzd,"NTA

sometimes you have to fly with a pet or a baby. it sucks but that's life."
bvsly8,"NAH. You phrased it really weird because it's not about the party at all, it's about asking for money from your sister in law. The way you phrased it, it's impossible to say you're in the wrong. 

If your SIL isn't able to make the full payment to you every month, it's probably too high. Has she only been working at this job for 3 months? 

I mean, one way of looking at it is that her being short on money is her problem, and you've already been more than generous to her by helping her out in the past year. But if I were in your shoes I would consider reducing the monthly payment and letting her pay it back over a longer period of time.

Complaining about the pool party is a dick move."
bvsomp,"YTA, on the grounds that I am 99% confident this is made up to give you a sub-appropriate way to complain about ""kids these days."""
bvsoqn,"NTA.

Tell them “no seriously.. You gotta go. You don’t pay rent here anymore so you don’t live here.”

 In the words of the late great Abraham Lincoln:

“This seems like a not my problem sort of problem”"
bvss96,"YTA. I understand asking her not to push it out to be gross on purpose, but asking her to hold it in or go in the other room is too far. What if you were married? Would she have to hide her gas in her own home? Bodily gas is part of being human and controlling other people's body functions is not part of a healthy relationship."
bvsvzw,NTA - she is making excuses for you to not go instead of telling you straight up. You should be upset.
bvsz67,"NTA, that sounds like a horrible deal, and you are able to opt out at will. And your friends/roommates shouldn’t have raised your part to 70 dollars out of no where."
bvszrv,NAH. She was probably surprised at the amount of money you've invested in the stock market and she must've thought that you were hiding something from her.
bvt2ix,NTA get a restraining order
bvt3re,"NTA. But, I would have dumped the cheater long ago if I were you."
bvt4a5,"NTA. 

~~NAH~~. It’s way too late to ask for a +1 and, most importantly, it’s your wedding.

[Edit] After reading the rest of the texts, I’ve updated my judgment. What a douche."
bvt4qs,ESH. Petty teenager stuff.
bvt5hz,NAH  Call your dad and tell him you'd like to spend time with him but you need to know ahead of time to work out your schedule.
bvt5jc,NTA based solely on your very insightful “not under my supervision” I totally understand and agree with where you’re coming from
bvt683,"YTA:

Bills, Rent, Food, Clothes, Internet ain't free. 60 hours a week is brutal. 

Dad works = that's fine he's ""doing as he should""

Mom works = YOU DIDN'T NURTURE ME!

Your mom busted her ass and worked. Both parents could and should work (and also be there for their kids) but obviously neither seemed to have done that yet you have a problem with only one and tell them that 'you fucking hate them' and call them out?

You're lucky you weren't homeless on the street. Ungrateful child."
bvt6ly,"NAH - You didn't know she had a boyfriend, and she didn't know to tell you because she must have not thought you were interested."
bvt9bq,"NTA. Do what you need to do. If he keeps bothering you, bring it up to HR. This isn’t cool."
bvt9u0,"NTA. Your boyfriend cant control his snoring. 
Your roommates can buy ear plugs if it bothers them that much. 

They lived with you at the other place prior to this new loft. 
Surely they must have known he snored and If snoring was going to be such an issue they shouldnt have agreed to live together again."
bvtaxj,"NTA and your mom kind of one but the real ass here is your a hole of a father. if anyone gets blocked it's him, if he wasn't such scum none of this would be happening."
bvtboo,"NAH. The cat's going through a difficult transition and it's normal to feel frustrated about it, your gf is probably also frustrated so you should be able to discuss it."
bvti13,"~~YTA borderline~~ ESH

He asked you a question but instead of just providing him with the information you kept arguing with him, prolonging the conversation instead of just giving him the information. You had it so why not just tell him instead of arguing that he should look it up. 

Could've been done simply in one response instead of arguing back in forth. Doesn't seem like your phone was dying that much...."
bvto7j,"YTA, if its not yours don't take it. Not that hard a concept."
bvtp7b,"I don’t know if I’d call you an asshole, but you do sound like a bit of a self righteous asshat. I’m not religious but I’ll bow my head and be silent when other people pray. I’ll stand up during a song, not because the song is worth standing up to but because it’s a community event that’s not about me and harms no one. 

Save your fights for things that matter."
bvtqnv,[deleted]
bvtqza,YTA. Why should he not eat as a panned because you changed your mind? He is his own person and doesn’t exist for your benefit. If he made plans he can keep them. I honestly don’t see why you are upset?  But then you said you felt tired. Then sick. Then said you offered to cook dinner and hang out and do homework and what not. So the whole thing seems fishy to me. Is this really some weird test of his devotion or some such thing?
bvtscm,"ESH
You may not see it that way, but what you said can easily be taken as an attack on their beliefs or a request for them to abandon their religion. Some of their beliefs suck, but at least they still seem to care about and support you, which is a hell of a lot more than countless other people get from religious family."
bvtus7,"YTA - id take my dads happiness any day over the temporary joyous feeling of booking a trip. Allow the payments, and try to cut your costs for the plane tickets."
bvtvza,"Originally I was going to rule you the asshole for intervening in a middle school fight, but after what the friend uncovered it was best for you and your mother to know.

Your sister sounds like she may need a therapist, a lot of kids aren’t going to act like that with out some sort of underlying issue.

Also remember that while she may be mad at you now, don’t take it to heart; this will fade, and she may thank you later. I know you may feel like an asshole, which is why you are posting here, but don’t doubt your instincts. You did the right thing.

NTA"
bvtwgk,"NTA. You’re not a whore and he had no right to call you that. No wonder you don’t talk to him about these issues when he reacts so freaking childish about it. Yes, there are health risk by having multiple partners, which is why your dad needs to be capable of having an adult conversation with you on it. Get your birth control, use protection and get tested occasionally. Hopefully you have an adult in your life that isn’t a giant douche that can help you with all of this stuff."
bvtxdb,"YTA if you do tip only when others are seeing, specially because a lot of restaurants underpay their staff as tips are expected."
bvtzz0,NTA. This is 2019. People text.
bvu2p8,"Because moving in with you is his only option? Listen, this sounds like a line he's used before. YTA if you go against your better judgment instead of telling him he needs to find a different roommate (preferably one he's not sleeping with)."
bvu3bc,"NTA - Your sister is the asshole. She made you burn the candle right then and then DUG IT OUT because she was so eager to see what was inside!??! The present is the enjoyment of the candle with a surprise at the end. She basically gave you something, then immediately ruined your present, ESPECIALLY terrible when that's the part of the gift you probably would have enjoyed. (Who doesn't love a candlelit bath?) 

&#x200B;

She deserved worse than what you did, which was perfectly acceptable."
bvu7sc,"NTA. 

To recap: She dumped you over the phone, refused to return your stuff, and threatened police action over you wanting your things back. My question is, why would you ever text this woman, no matter how lonely you are?"
bvu7v8,NTA. You paid for that bed. They were being selfish and acting entitled. Who gives a fuck if they are a couple? Fuck them. They didn't pay a dime and you don't owe them shit dude.
bvu9gr,"YWNBTA *IF* you talk to the neighbor first. Go over there, and kindly express your concerns, and come up with a solution together. If your neighbor resists, is rude, or otherwise nasty, call the HOA."
bvu9kl,"Gonna go with YTA but only because of the way you worded it. If he’s chubby, awkward and in high school, chances are he’s been putting up with a lot more than what you said to him smh."
bvuhgj,"NTA- after 4 years I wouldn’t expect to have to ask and thank my other half every time I wanted something to eat. I would make a point in future if either taking your own stuff, asking him every time  you go in the kitchen and thanking him when you sit down, or not staying at his place (but when he comes to yours make the same point if he eats). To be fair though I think something as petty as that after four years would ring an alarm bell with me. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who, from what you’ve said here, appears a bit oblivious to what you do for him, while he thinks you taking a $1 pizza is unacceptable?"
bvuhjh,"To be honest you're not an asshole because you're so self aware, and are here asking the right questions.  You're worried about being an asshole, so you're going out of your way to get advice.  That is a very adult attribute that many adults don't have.

I don't know what to tell you about your potential wedding though.  As you're likely to discover, it's a bit premature to make this decision today.  You don't even seem to have a potential future spouse.  By the time you get around to finishing college, finding a partner, getting a stable career, getting engaged, and planning your wedding, you may not have to make that decision at all.

Maybe they will have split up, maybe she will have solidified your position, maybe she becomes a better person, maybe maybe maybe.

I'd say don't stress too much about it right now.  You've got some time to make this decision, so don't commit yourself to something based on current facts.  See how things go.

If they're still together, and she's still a bitch, I don't know what the right decision is.  I mean, I do know that you get to pick who is at your wedding, but I don't see a way that they don't get upset about it.  He might see your point, but he's still gonna have to deal with her anger over that.  It's not worth causing a fight today for something that might not be a concern when it's actually time to start planning.  

I don't think your dad should miss your wedding, but I don't know if he'll go if she's not invited.  I just don't know.  Maybe you could just power through it for one day, and maybe she won't be a bitch to you on that day, but maybe she will ruin everything.  Thank goodness we don't have to make a decision on this right now :D"
bvuiv9,"Nta. I took the little class to do doordash and the guy literally warned us not to be rude, physical, or aggressive towards customers or we could lose the ability to doordash."

bvumt1,NTA do what's best for yoi
bvunu5,"NTA: you may not have went about it right, but he is not acting right.  Is it because he is mentally challenged or is he just an asshole.  YOu say mental problems but that could be anything from mild anxiety to full blown retardation so it's so generic as to be  undefined.   If he is mentally handicapped then you need to cut him some slack.  If he's just a normal dude who doesn't care to listen then he is causing his own problems."
bvup1b,"My kids have multiple allergies so I'm accustomed to dealing with their food when we go out. We always treat is as an our problem not the hosts problem. When hosts arrange to make stuff specially for them, we're appreciative but we never demand it.

NTA here, he's got mild milk allergy, he could order chicken wings or whatever for dinner. It's nuts for him to dictate what everyone else should eat."
bvurdr,"NTA, tipping isn’t mandatory. You choose to do what you want to do with your money.

bvuv20,"NTA.

Crappy friends need to have more empathy"
bvuwdy,"YTA - with a little bit of ESH sprinkled in. So, your girlfriend's sole purpose in life for the past 4 months (not to mention the pregnancy) is to spend 24 hours a day making sure this helpless creature has every single need looked after, which let me tell you is both mentally and physically exhausting, this is probably her first time getting drunk since being pregnant so it hits her harder than she's used to, and you're pissed that for ONE NIGHT you have to take care of YOUR CHILD. 

Do you think her job is easier than yours? Does she get a full 8 hours of sleep ever? How you come off in your post is that because she gets the privilege of staying home with this super easy baby which she just expelled from her body, she dare not ask for your help because you have to work a normal shift like almost every other parent on this damn planet. 

Maybe support your gf a bit more, and help care for your damn kid without being a dick.

Edit - Wow, I'm pretty new to actually posting on reddit, I did not anticipate the vitriol, though I should have.

First, I want to thank the anonymous award givers, you're too kind, I really don't deserve it. 

I'm not going to take the time to respond to all the ""ur dumb, feminist, must not be a parent, stupid man hating woman"" bullshit. I am a mom, I have two children, and I dealt with an alcoholic for years. It's not the same thing, grow up.

All I'm trying to get across here is be an equal in raising your child, should be common sense but clearly it's not.

Edit 2 - You guys in the comments are far better at getting the point across than I am, and said what I was trying to say in a much more understandable way. Thank you for being able to form more coherent thoughts than I am, ha ha.

Edit 3 - as I'm slowly making it through my inbox. I did respond to the OP right after my original post regarding involving the police, it appears once I fell asleep it just as quickly got buried, and that's fine. I stand by my original comment, I can't force ignorant and entitled people to see logic, and I'll go crazy trying to. My only hope is that those individuals have happy, healthy relationships with their partners and children, instead of resentment and frustration."

This sounds like very abusive, gaslighting behavior. I lived in a relationship that was just like this. It dawned on me that every argument we had turned into me apologizing for trying to make him feel bad by complaining about things that showed selfish disregard for me. I finally stopped apologizing and just let him be pissed. Then I divorced his ass. (Turns our this behavior is very typical of men with borderline personality disorder.) 

He either didn’t care at all that it was important to you, or didn’t want you to go because it was important to you. Combined with his reaction and lack of remorse, he’s a giant festering infected hemorrhoid on an asshole."

bvxseb,"NAH

You had to pretty much take care of yourself from the age of 15.  Your parents didn't raise you in your teen years.

There's a concept called social equity involved here.  Your parents didn't support you at a similar age.  None of your family tried to keep close familial ties,  supporting you emotionally if not financially.  In a sense, they created a family of people tied by biology but who have no wider emotional bonds.  And now that they need/want to prevail upon your feelings of family, you have none.  

Often, when family members tell a person to take on a responsibility, they do so because they wamt to pass on the guilt without taking on the responsibility themselves.  For instance, they don't want to help care for your sister but they want to be able to say, ""I told OP to take in Sis and they didn't.  OP is heartless!""  In reality, you'd be doing nothing different than they are doing.

In most cases like this, there are usually options no one has given much consideration.  And that's because the other options aren't as easy.  For instance, your sister could continue living with your parent and nearby extended family could help (with rides, groceries, etc...) as necessary.  Or one of the extended family members could take her in.  Or perhaps another local community member might be willing to take in your sister.  There are other options."

You did good trying to get them together again, and B was a dick so he's the first asshole. A sounds a bit controlling, he's the first to say you two should distance yourselves from B, and A's also the one who said you should block B.  I would never say that you should block another friend, if it's not harassment. That should have been your decision to make, and it definitely sounds like it wasn't your idea as much as A's idea. You told B that you'll block him, which means you gave him *yet another chance* to make it right between you two. 

But I'm not gonna say NTA, because you still failed to tell B why you wanted to block him. From the first look, it seems to me like B has some problems, and you two distanced him, then you wanted to block him, and say it to him so he knows he's blocked, and yet refused to explain why."
bvxw87,"NAH. She just wanted to do something nice for you. Spending a moderately outrageous amount of money for something super lavish every once in a while is acceptable in my book (when you can afford it).

‘Birth control is for both our benefit. For him it is not having to wear a condom and for me, its reducing the risk of pregnancy’

The whole wording of this made me sad. You really believe it is all up to you to stop the pregnancy and not him? And ontop of taking on the whole burden of stopping unwanted pregnancy he wont even come to support you when getting an implant that will stop the unwanted pregnancies because to him it is just so it feels better?

Stop being an arsehole to yourself and take a step back and try and look at your relationship not through rose coloured glasses and decide whether you want to be with this guy."

bvz45f,"NTA for how you feel, but as you already notice,  it's very easy to become toxic yourself in this situation. 

Voicing your concerns and express how you feel about this person and your bf being friends with them again is perfectly healthy. But in the end, you have to trust in your bf's criteria and ability to recognise a bad influence or someone with an agenda, and in him doing the right thing given that case. 

So, of course, you cannot possibly tell him you don't want them being friends. That would indeed be controlling and toxic. You could tell him once more how you feel about it, but if he chooses to continue associating with this friend, you gotta let it go (or well, break up if it's a dealbreaker for you). You do have a right to ask your bf to leave this person out of your shared life, due to your history. But that's about it. 

The friend is an immature jackass, having ""dibs"" on you? Life is not an episode of HIMYM. If your bf would be permeable to this guy's words then I would reconsider him as a bf...

Not for expecting her to pay, but holding things you paid for her in the past against her. You made it sound like you did it for your benefit and not because you were being generous.

Should have been like, ""hey can you buy mine too?"" Or something like that.

She sucks for expecting you to pay like that though."
bw19zv,NTA I'm not an epileptic mom but I'm a food allergy mom and you can bet your ass after an episode my kid isn't so much as getting out of bed for 24 hrs. I don't know what's up your mom's ass but my kids healing correctly from trauma always comes first.
bw1b51,"NTA. Cheating is wrong.

But seriously, it sounds like you don't really want to report them. So why would you?"
bw1bav,"NTA. It's completely fine if you want to have rules regarding your dog, and I think that everyone, even if they're your parents, must follow the rules that the dog's owner has made."
bw1dc2,"YTA. Unless you have a placard or plate to be in those spots, don't go in those spots, even if it's just for 5 minutes. People actually *need* those spots, and they could have come in when you were there."
bw1g4w,"NTA he's a parent too! It's not baby sitting when it's your own kids. He has just as much responsibility as you for evening care of the kids.

Sit him down, talk to him about how you feel and then work out a fair compromise that means you both get time to yourselves without the kids."
bw1haa,"> NTA. You are not obligated to tell your mother.

completely disagree. You are an asshole if you don't tell someone you love they are being conned by someone."
bw1i7d,"NAH. 2 weeks is enough time to find someone new. 

You could also offer to work for them until they find a replacement if it takes longer than 2 weeks (obviously tell them when you won't be able to continue, but that could help too)"
bw1kf1,NTA.  That’s some strange social media attention whoring.
bw1lg9,"ESH. 

You're shitty for looking. 

And she's shitty for doing this. Either way. You should had just ran from her."
bw1ltd,"NTA, if you had plans 5 times and he didn't make it then that's rude of him. But you are the asshole if you're mad he ""just talks about her"" he's excited! 

New relationships are like this. They go through a ""honeymoon"" phase and then he'll look around and wonder why he doesn't have any friends to do things with when his new gf is away."
bw1ncy,"NTA.

Kinda epic actually, let us know how it pans out. Dudes a douche for not paying you back in full."
bw1r6c,NTA - That's an insult poorly disguised as a compliment.
bw1s12,You’re misdirecting your anger. You need to talk to your dad. You and your brother are getting shafted.
bw1sa3,Nta. Studying is important. Respecting people when they say they dont want to talk is also important. Are you the only person they can talk too? Are they going through something or are they just bored?
bw1uty,"NTA because she lied. She could easily have said ""I put the rest in my truck for gas"" and I assume you would have been fine with that."
bw1xci,"NTA. But if you really value the friendship, let her deal with her health issue first and don't put too much pressure on her to repay you quickly. Try to be as gentle as you can, this might blow in your face."
bw21ah,NTA she seems like a crap therapist. She shouldn't be scoffing at you. Rating your anxiety is subjective. Find another therapist.
bw22nl,"NTA, when you are forced to volunteer it stops being voluntary work. 
Not every one has the desire to and that's okay."
bw2872,"NTA, but you should probably get the police involved, you may have just made the situation far more dangerous for the girl he ""loves""."
bw2939,"NTA. 

Idk why the fuck but whenever you tell certain people that you're not interested in eating something,  THEY ARE COMPELLED TO PUSH IT ONTO YOU.

For example.... me and fish.

""Try the sushi here""

""No thanks""

*Persistence of sushi pushing ensues"
bw29bp,"In my opinion, NTA, 

&#x200B;

The restaurant industry is a make or break, they didn't deliver service properly, I don't think that you should sit and suffer the consequences of it. 

&#x200B;

It seems as though that particular place is in a little bit of discord, don't beat yourself up over it"
bw29uv,"NTA - I would have probably argued with my friend as well over this. The issue is not the age gap but the societal difference. Personally, I believe that once you enter college, you shouldn't be dating anyone that's not 18+."
bw2bdm,"NAH. It doesn’t sound like they’re being malicious towards you, but I can understand why you’d snap. I agree with you, though; I think broadening your palette would be best for your health and well being in the long run, because eating what sounds mainly like carbs doesn’t sound great for you."
bw2c0q,"NTA but maybe next time they ask say “sure if you match, I’m running low” or smoke in your room. Other than that i imagine they’ll always ask and it’ll continue to annoy you unfortunately"
bw2c6m,"YWBTA

Let it go."
bw2dq7,NTA. They're just butthurt and got nothing better to be angry at.
bw2dve,"NTA

giving a guest a dirty mug? What the hell? I totaly get why you did not want to drink from that."
bw2jp9,"A mix between YTA and NAH.

Salsa dancing is a social dance. Maybe stop going to social dances with the group and stay at home if you won’t dance with anyone outside of class?"
bw2knw,NTA. He should 100% prioritize his girlfriend over random people he studied with. I understand wanting to celebrate the end of school with classmates ALSO but you should be the priority. You had a really sweet idea to have a nice dinner together to celebrate the end of school and to spend some time together before you're apart for a while and it's ridiculous for him to put the chance that he MIGHT do something random and last minute with classmates above that. I would think about if he's usually very considerate of you and your relationship or if this is pretty standard.
bw2l8r,"No judgement because this goes much deeper than him not putting thought into your birthday. You have some issues that would be better served by posting to something like r/relationship_advice.
Edit: those guys are much more helpful with things like this."
bw2l9m,"NTA. R is way out of line. This was a big deal for you and something you understandably took a measured approach to. If anything, R being so upset only reinforces why you told J first."
bw2mya,"ESH. You left the box on her side, so that is your fault. But you asked her to take it in, and if she doesn't by the time it's due, that's her fault. You couldn't go pick it up from her and take it yourself? That seems like a better option because then it won't be late and she won't have to pay fees. If she borrowed the book and kept it after the due date, I'd say she has to pay. But since it got mixed up in the moving boxes, that's on you. If you can't pick it up from her before it's due, just remind her frequently and if it ends up being late, maybe you should split the cost of the fines."
bw2n9p,"YTA If you go to a kid's movie, there will be kids.  If you don't like that, go to a late show on a school night."
bw2tof,YTA at least explain and say you don’t want to be together again. It’s really painful to just ghost someone basically without ever saying why.
bw2trz,"You would be, YTA if you open an investigation into your ex because she might be drinking, even though you said you were the one with the drinking problem. 

You should do your best to maintain a civil relationship for your children, who will only be caught in the middle. Don't sabatage the other parent."
bw2u7m,"NTA, he needs to be a grownup and wash his hands, and put a band aid over the sore or something"
bw2ux8,"Sorry to tell you this but ESH. Emotional cheating is a thing. You are in an emotionally intimate relationship with a girl you like who is committed to someone else. ESH because she is emotionally cheating, and the boyfriend also seems like a jerk."
bw2w4q,"NTA. This dog is yours by rights. And I’ll say that 2 months isn’t a huge amount of time, so while the dog and kid may have gotten along, it wasn’t as though they had a lifelong bond. Is the dog acting sad to be away from the kid?"
bw30r9,"ESH. I don't think you're an asshole for accidentally getting too turnt, as that has happened to the best of us. But the text was pretty guilt-trippy, honestly. However the ""no trust"" and ""lack of self-control"" seems to be an overreaction. It's not like you go out and get slammed every weekend, this happened just now. If you had a habit of doing this often, I'd say otherwise."
bw31ec,NAH why not let your sister decide what she wants to do
bw33h0,For me I'm going with NAH need to know if she was asking for money and scamming or not to fully go with the others but we don't have it. I would have at least waited to hear the rest of the sentence. And can't call her an asshole for solely approaching you without knowing her intent.
bw33zv,"Conditional YTA because I have no idea why ""it's a no no for cops to hang out with convicted felons"" Seems like you just ghosted her because you couldn't bear to tell her you're a convicted felon.

You paid your debt to society, no? Why can't you and her hang out?"
bw342v,"NTA, nothings wrong with a congrats message"
bw37b0,"NTA-  life is too short to spend with people that make you feel less than, family or not. Skip it without regret."
bw3dfn,YTA for a) giving him a hard time now and b) questioning if he’s bi because he’s only dated women so far
bw3ixq,"NTA, this is a toxic work environment that needs to have attention brought to it. Also wtf, can companies really say ""we'll give you a month pay if you shut your mouth"" that's straight up bribery."
bw3luc,"YTA. We all have hobbies that others would deem useless, but it doesn’t mean they’re not enjoyable and beneficial to us. He’s still doing well in school, let him enjoy his free time."
bw3ms9,NRA. Irish goodbyes are a time honored tradition in my house.
bw3mvz,"NAH. Just ask him to do the dishes. If he won't or acts like a jerk about it, you have a bigger problem. But hopefully it will be a simple matter."
bw3ta3,NTA this is no different than if you had dated and slept with 15 girls before her. As long as you know you are clean and not exposing her to anything contagious you don't have to volunteer this information.
bw3un2,"Not for complaining, but YTA for the ""that old bastard"" and also the pathetic ""if he wants to get out of that shitty job"" argument"
bw3web,"YTA 

Jeez, you didn’t have time to file a police report BUT they should drop everything to find it for you days after a bereavement? Think that through for a moment."
bw3xpz,NTA. This isn't even an ex. It's literally just a friend. And you're not even doing anything active. Your girlfriend is taking this far too personally.
bw3zsc,"NTA. If you’re sick, you’re sick."
bw40v7,"NTA I also find stuff like that stressful and often leave early. Nothing wrong with that. I mean, you go to an event like that to enjoy it and when it stops being fun, you shouldn't be forced to stay. Maybe you should plan ahead more though, telling them you are gonna leave at a certain time so they don't prepare food that noone will eat."
bw40y9,"NAH. 

Even VR porn is just porn... if you’re not actively engaging with/ speaking to/ touching the actresses... it’s not cheating. 

THAT BEING SAID: everyone’s definition of cheating is different. What you and I consider “not cheating” could very much cross that line for your wife. For that reason, it’s not our place to police the way she’s reacted (feeling hurt, etc). 

Even so, I don’t think you’re an asshole, nor do I find her one for feeling uncomfortable with what she discovered. 

I hope you two can find some common ground & talk this out."
bw4193,"ESH - her for not giving you the picture when you asked, and you for going through her phone."
bw41t9,"NTA.

This is some major red flags. This may not be a job you want to be in long term. Your boss doesn't seem to know how to prioritize, and you'll suffer the consequences."
bw4b8d,NTA Unless you are a bridesmaid then your sister is being obnoxious.
bw4bnu,"NTA, but let’s be practical about this. Hide it better or something."
bw4dq2,NTA- your brother should understand how expensive it is to travel. He should also understand that you’re in a tough spot financially. You shouldn’t spend money just to visit a baby that won’t remember you until they’re a few years old. If it means that much to you/your brother. There’s always FaceTime/Skype/ any other form of video chat
bw4dqi,[deleted]
bw4fgs,"Nope. NTA. A month is a long time and you have plenty of time to travel around. I often make pit-stops when I travel. You even offered your brother and his fiancée to join you. 

So long as you pay for your extra travels then that’s fine. 

Besides this is between you and your brother. Your parents and their friends don’t matter."
bw4fjo,"NTA and a wise choice. Big expensive gifts like fancy blinds and new roofs are rarely free.   I learned that the hard way. The last thing you need is someone thinking you're not self sufficient when you are and should be feeling very proud of yourself. Also, imagine if you ever sell..  Your aunt could become seriously pissed off about it and you don't want your house to be a thumb."
bw4g6j,"YTA: it’s a goddamn nickname. Your kid is not going to care that half the family calls him something else. Fuck, your kid might not like your nickname and go by something else later. Get over something so petty. Your husband clearly didn’t like your name enough to name him that permanently"
bw4h7v,NAH - explain your position politely and this seems like a non-issue.
bw4luh,"NTA, someone of your roommates nature shouldn't be allowed animals"
bw4o42,YTA. There were 45 minutes left in the game and you weren't going to win. It didn't matter and didn't cost much to finish the game. Walking out hurts the rest of the game.
bw4ovd,"NTA, especially because it’s every Sunday. That’s quite a commitment, especially as we get older and acquire more responsibilities. I wouldn’t stop going completely, but maybe take it down to a couple a month. That’s what I would do, anyway."
bw4q1c,NTA. Stick it to her
bw4te4,"ESH - Probably should have told her, but who doesn't check to see if their stuff arrived? When i order stuff i check everyday online too see if it was delivered lol, i dont think it's a big deal though, she obviously isn't too worried about it...."

bw51b5,NAH You won't know why he didn't tell you until you ask him about it.
bw52fh,"YTA

> I should just tell my husband I’d be willing to have a baby if he promises to take over all of the childcare, from infancy to teenager. This way we can stay together, he gets his child, and I still get to live my life as I’ve always dreamed.

You will be living with your kid withholding your love.   The kid wont understand, all they will see is a narcissist who only cares about themselves.   Break up with the husband it will be kinder to everyone than this."
bw52qq,"ESH.

She sounds like a real treat, and I don't blame you for ending things. But be an adult and tell her you're ending things. Ghosting is an asshole move until proven otherwise imho."
bw52uy,"NTA

Does your uncle have a copy somewhere? I assume you both have a copy?"
bw536h,"NTA. Once a week is plenty supportive. Most wives wouldn’t even do once a week, or ever.

He should be supportive of *you* having your own life/hobbies/social network."
bw54ey,Wow. A tale in AITA where not only is no one the asshole but everyone who’s an adult acted like one?
bw55qd,"Ooooooof. I have to go NAH here, because it's not like you went out of your way to throw your beliefs in her face or tried to hurt her intentionally, it's a pretty natural outgrowth of the conversation. Might have been nicer for you to leave it at ""I found it boring,"" certainly, but I can't fault you."
bw570e,"Definitely NTA. He seems controlling, and you were being perfectly reasonable and helpful."
bw57o5,"NTA, but americans are so fucking weird about wearing shoes indoor."
bw591t,"NTA. You told him the bong didn't belong there, so you don't have an obligation to watch out for it or to be particularly careful about it. None of the other prom night drama matters, and you're doing more harm than good by bringing it into the situation. 

Also, learn to use paragraphs."
bw5bim,"NTA, if you choose to have a destination wedding but not pay for your guests' trip you shouldn't be upset when some of them decide they can't afford to come."
bw5d1s,"NTA its your shit. He took stuff from you without your permission, ofc you want it back"
bw5hym,Yta. Life tip: diagnosing someone as mentally ill because you don’t understand their behavior makes you a gigantic dick.
bw5m10,"ESH. You maybe shouldn't have said it to her face, but you are right. That's creepy as hell."
bw5sf3,"NTA  


If she moved in her stuff and is staying consecutive nights, she lives there.  


Meaning she's not only entitled to the benefits of living there, but also the responsibilities."
bw5vfv,NTA— especially since you have sleep issues. People without sleep issues just don’t understand. I’m surprised he doesn’t after 3 years but reserve judgement because I don’t know you two.
bw5vo4,"YTA. Sorry OP, this is hilarious but you shouldn’t have said that to a kid. She probably has enough issues with that mother alone. I know you’re tired. I know you’re probably uncomfortable because you’re pregnant. That doesn’t give you a free pass to be nasty to someone who didn’t even wrong you. The mom deserved it but not the kid.

Edit: I know people are saying ESH and not YTA but I’m sticking to my guns here. No matter how egregious the mom was, OP was the biggest asshole here for attacking a child. I think that overshadows what the mom says and I don’t want to downplay the wrongness of OP’s actions. You don’t have to aggress everyone who aggresses you. Even if you’re right you can be wrong. That’s what this sub is about."
bw5x4x,"YTA. He asked for an apology. It would have cost you nothing to give it. If he’s bringing it up after this long, clearly, he remembers it and it’s bothering him. I don’t get you using “I don’t remember that” as a reason not to apologize, unless you are accusing him of making up this entire event. Why would he be lying?

Then your other reason is because he gave you an ultimatum. He’s giving you an ultimatum because you essentially accused him of lying, and because you’re trying to justify not apologizing by saying it was too long ago. It clearly is still something that bothers him, and yet here you are trivializing his feelings. Who wouldn’t say “piss off until you can figure out how to apologize” in that situation?

You know you’ve done offensive things to him in the past. You know you hung out with him in that place with that other friend before. So unless you genuinely think you definitely never could have done what he described and that he’s a complete liar, YTA."
bw5xql,"NTA, your body, your choice. However, based on the information you provided, I would encourage you to speak to a professional if you are experiencing nightmares and panic attacks about this.

bw64es,"NTA, he has a room."
bw68jj,YTA for not giving him more notice .  YWNBTA if you had other plans and gave him plenty of notice to make alternate plans
bw68pj,NTA. You didn't ghost him. You told him why you didn't want to be around him and you respectfully bowed out. Hopefully this will be a turning point for him and he'll start being more circumspect about how he treats people.
bw69o1,"NTA, but cheer up."
bw6abb,100% NTA. You're looking out for you. She's trying to guilt you into taking her back and you aren't taking the bait.

bw6bbk,"How do people believe you caused her miscarriage?  Not literally asking... just wow!

bw6cd0,"NAH

 you just shouldnt put minors in that type of situation, tell her you had a misunderstanding and wish her the best, maybe save her some cake or something. No hard feelings."
bw6hqs,"NTA, for the love of god, why is everyone fine with casual child abuse. She's a child, she should be cared for properly, good on you for calling CPS."
bw6i39,[deleted]
bw6ie4,YTA. Dont make her do things she's not comfortable with. Sheesh.
bw6j80,"YTA. I totally get why you’d want to keep it to close friends, but you’ve already said yes so to backtrack is a bit of an asshole move, especially if they’re friends.

If they’re going to seriously affect your celebration, by all means rescind the invitation (side note: I’d do it myself, not ask the other friends to do it). 

But I’d be prepared to have them a) take it personally and b) think it was a dick move for you to say yes then take it back."
bw6pfl,"YTA, those are major pieces of furniture and I don’t want to touch your damn mattress"
bw6q9q,"ESH. Straight up leaving her behind is a little petty EVEN IF YOU CAN JUSTIFY IT. Confront her about making you late, but  don't just bring up issues while they're happening: if someone does something that inconveniences everyone talk about it after everyone cools off about it and is willing to speak rationally.  Don't do it too soon but wait so long until another incident happens. She needs to get better at scheduling but seriously 

> I thought that leaving her is acceptable since she doesn't respect me either. 

You're admitting this was disrespectful and that you did it, in even some part, to get back at her. That's childish. She needs to fix this and YOU need to not do that anymore."
bw6t89,"Absolutely, unequivocally, NTA. If you're feeling generous and want to do something kind, then it would be a nice thing to do, but you ABSOLUTELY should not feel obligated, you don't owe it to him in any way."
bw6tdt,"NTA it sounds like he hasn’t really been that good of a friend to you for a while now. Your only other option is to flat out tell him the truth and I doubt that would go over well or that he would even believe you. Your mom is wrong about it being selfish. Do what is best for you, OP."
bw74ya,NTA. Really?   Why are you with this guy?   He sounds like a lazy slob.
bw75jh,[deleted]
bw76jp,"NTA. You are in serious danger and should contact the police immediately - your boyfriend has killed more people than Dahmer.

bw76r1,"NTA, a shitty home life can explain why you’re an asshole but it doesn’t excuse it. You don’t deserve to be harassed and insulted just because you got dealt a better hand in life."
bw7c9b,"NTA- She should’ve really talked with you before doing this. However, 14 years is a long time. You should talk to her. Tell her how this makes you feel. If she doesn’t understand after that then you should cut it off."
bw7cq5,"NAH. month to month for a reason. Give as much notice as possible, and you may lose the friend."
bw7ct1,NTA.  You have the right to move around in your apartment.   You should complain to your landlord.
bw7kya,"I hate to say it because I'm on your side, but yeah, YTA in that situation. Put on your party manners and play nice to secure the bag for your team and then talk shit about them when you leave like the Lord intended. 

It sounds like you've got a lot of feels about this, and I would too. It might be worth talking with a therapist of some sort to poke around and see if there's a less word-vomit-at-a-work-party sort of way of handling what seem to be some pretty honest feelings about class, privilege, and belonging."
bw7mh6,"uhhhh no, NTA. 10 months isn’t a very long time, ESPECIALLY for her to have an opinion on your money. If your accounts are not jointed, then she honestly doesn’t really have any say in what you do with your money."
bw7pb9,YTA. You shouldn't be losing your shit on people on a regular enough basis for them to associate it with pie. Seek therapy.
bw7qrc,[deleted]
bw7u9v,"NTA 
Your trying to use logic with a beloved pet and it just doesn't work. Emotions are involved and there not ready to let go."
bw7ue2,"YTA - Honestly I think the biggest issue here is  the neglect that lead to death of the previous companions!

You said that all the other pets died of neglect when she moved out. So this means your sister is the one that’s ever really took care of the pets in the home.  

Weren’t you living in the same home? How could you stand bye and let them die such an inhumane death? 

Nobody in that home should of gotten another pet or ever get one again. OP, you may think that you’ll take amazing care of your planned and disciplined dog, but you don’t have the compassion and love side of it. You’re not raising a sled dog or military trained guard dog. You’re sharing your life with a best friend."
bw7ukm,ESH. I think you overreacted. But I also think that dress code like that are ridiculous and they need to be more relaxed.
bw7wka,"NTA, I completely understand and am on your side 100%"
bw7ym1,"NTA

Your husband's previous attempts in the kitchen should have given him an idea the effort it takes to make a good meal. He disregarded the effort you put in to care for him.

> I still feel like it could've been so easy to just have a small snack before dinner, wait until the food was done, and then ate it while the taskrabbit guy was working

This is so blindingly obvious that I struggle to see how he, ostensibly a responsible adult, didn't think of it"
bw82ic,"NAH - Your hair, your choice. Plus some of those charities sell the hair you give them anyway so the cancer patients aren't getting them for free. Would it be nice if you gave it to an org that does it give it for free? Yes. But still it is up to you."
bw841o," NTA - sure sounds like your parents are, however."
bw86w1,"NTA
But keep your joy inside 
It’s not a good look to gloat. Looks unbecoming. And unprofessional"
bw89id,YTA. She probably just accidentally switched some dates. If she is big on Birthdays missing yours will be embarrassing for her.
bw8bfn,"NTA, you don't owe him anything. His first reaction to being told you can't make it is to cry on snapchat about how girls are always playing games, do you really want to hang out with someone like that?"
bw8d7m,"NTA, throwing the form in the fireplace was probably a bit dramatic."
bw8jz4,"NTA

Honestly parents should NEVER put their children in between them in arguments. Although you’re an adult now, it doesn’t make you any more responsible for their relationship. I’m very sorry to hear that this has happened to you and hope all will end well"
bw8l90,"NTA

She left with no warning and won’t respond to messages. Throw it away, donate it, whatever."
bw8mcj,"Just googled, incest is not illegal in Spain, so I would guess that had something to do with why they moved there."
bw8miw,"NTA

But your friend sure is. Sure you didn’t “set a date” but isn’t it just common decency to pay someone back ASAP? And to respond in such a way is just rude"
bw8r5p,"NTA - charity is just that, optional. 

However, not participating with the team may not be such a great idea. There are loads of stupid things that happen in workplaces, such as collections for baby showers, where one feels an arse for not participating.

You are also free to make your conclusions about your relationship from that. She sucks, too, for not treating all her kids equally quilt-wise, but you asked about whether you were TA for saying what you did to her - and you were TA for demanding a handmade quilt, with a deadline to boot."

When my wife was in medical school she made very little money compared to me. I was fine with this situation, but we agreed she shouldn't pay nothing. I made about 5 times more than she did. So what we did was figure out all of our mutual bills and I paid 5/6ths of it, and she paid 1/6th. She was contributing, paying what she could, and ensured she still had money to pay for things she needed (gas in her car, clothes, etc...). The most important part was that we had discussed this in length and agreed upon it, so that neither of us felt resentment for paying more/less and that we each contributed.

Instead you inserted yourself into the middle of their marriage not happening for primarily selfish reasons (I think you being a Royal Navy man influenced your decisions a lot, tbh which I can sympathize with).  It's definitely best Kathy knows, and it's somewhat good everyone knows why this wedding is not happening and that John is a repeated liar, but to not expect blowback or think everyone is going to unanimously applaud your decision is crazytown.

bwhfqe,"NTA.  Wow.  Talk about beggars being choosers.  Sounds like he'll need to be more careful budgeting.  Send him over to r/eatcheapandhealthy or r/foodprepsunday.  That will help him manage on less.  

Why does he even have his own food budget, anyway?  Why don't you just have a family food budget and you all eat from that?  That would be cheaper for everyone.  

Does he at least pitch in his fair share for chores and whatnot around the house?"

bwhgty,"**NTA** at all, a friendship isn't a suicide pact. You can break up a friendship any time for any reason, and in this case it sounds like your friends just aren't compatible with you. (Because they are homophobic wankers and you are a decent person.) You don't have to remain friends with anyone, especially if you've outgrown them, and it sounds like you have. You're clearly uncomfortable with the things they say to you and each other, you let them know, they made it clear they don't care, so you blocked them. Totally justified.

Good luck meeting some better people, I assure you they're out there."

bwhu6t,NTA. This doesn’t seem like much of a marriage if he expects you to operate completely separately financially. It’s one thing to have seperate finances but this is nuts. Plus you also put in the time caring for his grandmother. The idea that you have to spend 20 years paying him back for “your half” of the house is also kind of crazy. Will your name be on the title? What happens when or if you have kids? I think you two need to have some serious talks about the nature of your relationship and your future.

So now he and the rest of your family gets to experience what's it like to be disappointed by people you loved. Your brother at least had the rest of the family to support him, while you had no one. 

I know it's easy for us to sit here and say be the bigger person, but the reality of the matter is, all actions and decisions have consequences. What your brother and family did will cause resentment from you, and similarly your brother and family will likely resent you too. Your relationship with your brother may be strained because of this, but then again, he chose to strain it in the first place by not being there for you for 2 years in a row. So frankly what did everyone really expected anyway. I think this is something you'll need to sit down and talk it out with your family.

Also, perfect attendance and class clown (do people really celebrate that as an achievement??) sounds like one of those fun awards and not a serious milestone one like a graduation. I would personally think it's a bad idea to skip out on his graduation."

This isn't really a moral quandary. The \*right\* thing to do here is obvious.

It seems like you're projecting your emotions at not having a positive relationship with a father figure onto your sister.

>I also have a very very strained and difficult relationship with their  father, my stepfather.  We rarely speak and avoid eachother when I  visit. I am aware that my feelings are likely a combination of  resentment (she hes a doting father whom I strongly dislike, and also my  dad died before she was even born. Also most of my childhood was steeped in poverty and tragedy, whereas  she has had a staunchly middle class upbringing)   
  
>  
>In her defense (kinda) she's always been her daddy's princess.

You're aware that you resent your sister because of these relationships, but you continue to blame a child for your dislike? Maybe she acts out because of the way you treat her."
bwknhl,"YTA - unless you have an emergency fund, you already said you have been looking for months and haven't found anything, what makes you think you will suddenly find something now?  You said you are fine living in a truck as long as you are together, but your partner may not feel that way.  DO you not understand once you don't have a place to live, you can't find a job, and vice versa!  There are many people living in their cars who are well trained but can't find a job because they don't have a house.  You don't just to make the choice for you and your partner to live out of a car just because your job is making you upset.  I guarantee you sitting in your car without food to eat will be a hell of a lot worse than going to a job you don't like.

You don't seem to realize that getting behind on your finances can leave you struggling the rest of your life.  There are many hard working people out there with skills who can't make it out of the gutter once they fall in.

Go flip burgers or work at a gas station to bring money in.  You don't do that to your partner.  Talk about selfish!"
bwkp30,"NTA. I’ve been in your exact situation before. He doesn’t understand why you don’t want to hang out with him, but that doesn’t mean you’re obligated to do it. I’m glad at least your dad can see where you’re coming from."

It sucks that you didn't get to say goodbye. You're not an asshole for being upset, and your Dad should have said something before rehoming Eli."
bwkq78,"NTA. Both in general, because we should let kids play with whatever they like without worrying about enforcing arbitrary gender roles. And in particular here because labeling cooking implements as ""girl toys"" isn't just sexist, it's also just plain wrong.

bwmeh9,"YTA I was on the fence until you mentioned that you took advantage of her mental illness to get her to agree not to contest the will. That would also likely not hold up in court as she’s, you know, mentally ill and might not be considered capable of truly signing that contract, something you yourself admitted. Your grandmother can give her money to whomever she wishes but if you’re looking for validation you’ve come to the wrong place."
bwmi35,"NTA. Wow. That is an extremely tough one. Are there options where you could work with the foster care system to make sure he goes to a good home? Do you have friends who want kids? I empathize for you. That is not an easy decision to make. I don’t think there is a right or wrong here, only what you decide is best. It sounds like your family can not handle the stress and although foster care sucks it seems like giving him the potential to be in a good home could be better than keeping him with you, considering you aren’t in a very good situation yourselves. Best of luck to you."
bwmkfh,"Yes, YTA. Don't hook up with your ex who is clearly still hung up on you! Don't screw with her friend at the same time! Making clear that you don't want feelings involved after breaking up with her will not set this right.

I somehow hope that Karen will take the kids..."
bwmkg1,"Cha cha not real smooth. Also NAH.

bwmlpf,"NTA- she should have cancelled the order. You’re not an errand boy. I get that it wouldn’t be a huge inconvenience but that doesn’t mean you’re obligated to do it.

There's nothing wrong with wanting to get to know your BIL better, and often one on one catch ups are the best way to do that. 

But people aren't trading cards either, it's kind of a strange attitude to take. 'You got to take my husband to dinner so now it's only fair I get to take yours!'

More like, it's four individual people with individual wishes. In the earlier case it worked out well- your husband and sister liked the idea and you were okay with it. The same things aren't falling into place this time. And sure, it's odd your sister doesn't want it to happen, but that's her choice. Maybe she just doesn't like the idea of being spoken about while she is isn't present! Whatever.

bwnymq,"NAH

It’s pretty customary for parents to want to help their adult children when a newborn arrives (and may actually very much be to your benefit — they can let you get a few hours of very important sleep). That being said, it’s your baby and your home, and every family operates differently.

I think you’re justified in wanting your home to yourself, but I also think your MIL is justified in potentially being upset, as she probably wants to help and potentially bond more with your family."

Alcoholism is a very legitimate reason for a divorce. You are not an asshole at all in this situation. Sorry about your wife’s disease, she is in a lot of pain right now. 

FYI - she cannot have 1 or 2 beers, because addiction will make her have more. She has to remain completely sober to recover. And it’s up to her to do it. More chances from you will not help it.

The expensive wedding has nothing to do with that."
bwo3r4,"A prenup is fine, if it is discussed and agreed upon, and then drafted with both parties needs represented. 

However, it is rarely in a females best interests to agree to a prenup that is drafted with the sole intention to protect her spouses money in the event of a split. 

Most marriages produce a child or children. 

The female goes through pregnancy, birth, and often it is her career that takes the biggest impact due to having a child. As the saying goes, “women are expected to work like they don’t have children, and raise children as if they don’t have to work”. 

If your prenup is fair and representative of both of your needs, then it would be unreasonable for her not to agree. 

However, given how you went on about your wealth, protecting your investments, etc, I would be very surprised if you have included provision for any children, loss of career potential if she becomes SAHM, etc."

bwoh8n,NTA. That's exactly the route she should have taken before quitting. She should have gotten help for her ADHD while working instead of ghosting her employer with calling off and whatnot. Having the diagnosis doesn't excuse her for poor work ethic.
bwojc6,"NTA. If your friend is fully aware of your triggers and your PTSD, then it seems he chose a horror game to try and trick you/play a prank on you. It backfired. They ran the risk with using their expensive VR system. 

As someone who also suffers from PTSD, I know how little control you have over the reaction. It's an instinct. Your brain is literally just trying to protect itself, so you're doing whatever needs to be done to achieve that protection.
Obviously it's good to feel remorse/regret over the accidental breaking, but I agree that you're not required or responsible to pay for it because of the situation."

>At 10:30 pm O texts me asking if I'm okay and if I still need her to call me. I update her, but I'm mostly distracted with the search. Due to the character limit I can’t go into detail, but she was found, and I make it home at 12 AM. Ex-BF texts me at 3 AM asking if I'm alright.

They all got back to you at a decent time imo.

>if I was on the hearing end of my texts and calls, I would've come down to help, or at the very least stayed up all night with them. 

While it would be nice of to do that, it shouldn't be expected.  You had all your family helping already so it's not as if you were exactly alone at that point.

>I would've NEVER texted to ask if someone was okay, especially if they requested that I called, since this was such a serious situation - and I feel that no one took this as seriously as it was.

You texted B and O first...

>AITA for feeling this way?

I get that it was an emotional and stressful situation, but I feel you're over-reacting and being unfair to your friends."
bwp82m,"YTA. 
Id check your lease too, there might be rules against using the garage for anything other than storage.

That aside, however, its common courtesy not to be terribly disruptive in appartment living.

Edit: Originally judged over timing, but think OP meant 12 PM, not AM. My decision remains the same though."
bwpdmr,YTA for letting this person walk all over you. Grow a fucking spine op
bwpf9q,"Going to abstain from voting: this issue has nothing to do with your wife making suggestions about your presentation. This situation is getting this far because of the overarching resentment that's present in your relationship that you aren't communicating. 

This is a /r/relationships post."
bwpl30,"ok, firstly, take a deep breath.

there's a clear route to changing your return to the correct one:

i'm sure the canadian tax service deals with this stuff all the time.

it seems to me that there aren't asses, here, but a bunch of shouty people that don't know what they are talking about.

in this sort of circumstance, you should be taking responsibility for your own taxes, and not letting the shouty ignorant people do them for you."
bwpltg,"YTA

Not letting the third kid take credit makes sense, but taking three over the second kid without talking about it first smacks of assholery.

Quick tip: if your title includes ""screwing over someone else"" you're probably the asshole"
bwpsm5,"> She always talked about how you should always be there for friends

NTA.  She means being there for her and supporting whatever brand she's pushing.  She is in for a rude awakening later down the road when she realizes the new 'friends' she finds will be more interested in her following than her personally."
bwpvvj,YTA. You never mention a woman's weight even if she is complaining about it to you. That's women 101
bwpx7a,"NAH, just make sure you're not rude when you explain the situation.

Edited NTA to NAH"
bwpx7r,NTA.  Your mother is in denial.  You know who you are and you know what is happening to you at home.  Don't ever doubt yourself.  And congrats on being exactly who you are.  There are lots of people out there who will love and accept and embrace and celebrate you for who you are.  I'm so sorry that your parents aren't among them.
bwpxut,"NTA. You were able to defend yourself alone, he can do the same. On the other hand, you should tell the stall Nazi that there is not any law legislating toilets."
bwpy3s,"Omg NTA

Go to Cape Cod and have fun like a normal sane person. That's the way to self-improvement, traveling with friends, seeing the world, having bonding experiences etc.

Landmark is a CULT.

This is not like skipping a therapy session or anything like that, run far, far away from Landmark. I have heard of them from r/antimlm..."
bwq0qv,NTA. She certainly appeared to be signaling that she was interested; going in for a kiss was not unreasonable.
bwq2ua,"Yes, YWBTA for sticking your nose in other peoples business. You're no longer in a relationship, stay out of his."
bwq4by,NTA. It sounds like you genuinely loved him. It's not uncommon for people to grow apart and then have regrets when someone dies. Those people are just being nasty.
bwq5iz,"NAH. You don’t have to help her if you don’t want to, but she’s not an asshole for asking for 1hr of time from you once a week. you said you have a lot of time on your hands and one hour a week is nothing. It also sounds like she just wants to practice conversing, not get tutored"
bwq740,NTA. He puts himself and everyone around him in danger by coming to work impaired. Not reporting him would make you an asshole.
bwqakm,"NTA 

If someone is gonna rent out a flat they should at least clean it and make sure it’s livable."
bwqep8,"NTA but I wouldn't complain about it, I'd twist it into trying to find more info while throwing major shade at the girls.  Something like calling and asking to speak to the manager then when you have them on the phone mention that you were in the store today and asked to apply because you saw the big sign saying no resume was needed but you were told by all four employees at the helpdesk the sign was wrong and you do need a resume to apply, so you are just trying to figure out how to proceed.  This way you keep the focus on the job which you need and presumably might want but also rat out the employees without it being the centerpoint of the conversation.  If you just don't care about the job opportunity, then sure complain if you want to."
bwqfiq,"NTA, its a public space. If she doesn't like seeing your dog take a dump in a public space, then she shouldn't have moved to a place where seeing such things was in her field of view. As long as you're picking up your dog's leavings, fuck  that neighbor bitch."
bwqis4,"So, TL;DR: an employee forgot that she accepted to work specific hours, and when her boss reminded her she corrected her error and worked those hours.

NAH. Just someone with a desperate need for others to confirm what she did was ok."
bwqjk3,"NTA

Dude, it's been 3 years.  She's got a kid with this other dude.  She isn't your concern.  And even if she thought she should be, it's not her business.  If she didn't want you dating L, she should have stuck with you.  

Ask L out.  Be honest about the fact you dated, if anything happened, and that it ended a long time ago.  Especially if you and M don't really talk anymore.  The more honest you are, the better.  Key is, don't hang up on it otherwise you will seem like you never got over it."
bwqmnc,"NTA- you asked and they both said ok. The second roommate should have spoke their mind originally and not lied. Also you clarified with roommate number one since you now live in their house. I think you did the proper things. 

Roommate number two- YTA"
bwqq5f,"NTA - yet.  I get where you are coming from.  This all definitely sounds weird.  It's great that she loves that little girl like she's her own but she will never replace that girls mother.  I would chalk this up to her being young but I'm also guessing there is a lot of jealousy on her part because the husband-to-be has a past that includes his daughter's mother.  Seeing that this is your best friend, you probably should say something to her but I would advise you to temper how you phrase it.  If I was acting like a tool, I'd want my best friend to say something to me.  However, considering the delusions seem high in this one, be prepared to be immediately shut down."
bwqs8z,"NTA -  you should be pissed and you do have a choice,  they will figure it out,  just like they figured out how to get booze and cigarettes."
bwqswl,NTA - her reaction is exactly why you need to move out of state.  😮
bwqvf8,"NTA, dude. It sounds like you and your mother have a very toxic relationship, and have for quite a long time. But you are an adult. This is YOUR life. You get to call the shots. If you think you would find a better life out in CO, then I encourage you to go. Getting out of the grip of your mother sounds like it would be really good for you. She's keeping you, a grown ass person, locked in a little box. That's not healthy."
bwqvr0,NTA. Sounds like he has feelings for you but never spoke up about it so now he feels all twisted that you're seeing someone else instead of him. You were always clear that your relationship was strictly a FWB situation so he has no right to be upset with you.
bwqwk6,"ESH. Your wife ""hates men"" and you ""get along with men way more than woman because they are less catty."" Sounds like you're an asshole match made in heaven."
bwqxz6,"Look, you are NTA for not agreeing to continue gambling.  If he wants to take his 150k and waste it, that's his right.  Giving him his money is your only responsibility to him.  You can definitely tell him you are concerned that he will gamble it away when you give it to him, but that's his choice to make.  This is probably for the best honestly, once the immediate dopamine hit of big winnings has passed with time he might both thank you for not upping stakes and responsibly use his money."
bwqygd,"NTA. Get the ticket to her in advance and politely tell her to catch a Lyft.

EDIT: Just caught that the concert is today. In that case, leave the ticket for her (or email it to her, whatever)...and politely tell her to catch a Lyft. You can meet her at the show."
bwqzg8,YTA - you aren't using them and it's important to your SO regardless of how you feel about her family. You can keep being TA if you want. They are your tickets. But damn dude. You don't have to sit with these people or anything.
bwr3l5,YTA females go through this and now she feels you'll not really take care of the girls if something happens to her. You've made her think you'll just ignore any problems they come to you about in regards to female issues. Grow up man.
bwr5e4,YTA - or YWBTA - there’s no reason you can’t just give them back everything in the sack and let them sort them out themselves.  Just pitching everything would be wasteful.
bwr5pg,"NTA

I accepted a position 2 months ago after 8 months unemployed. 

A week later i was offered a job that was closer, better pay, and more in line with my skills. 

I took the second job."
bwr7jh,"NTA. You’re spending a bunch of money on a trip he wants, and he won’t even tell you the amount with reasonable notice?"
bwr8m3,"ESH

The customer sucks for not identifying unique information about his firearm that would alter the project.

You suck because as the professional in the industry, you didn't walk through the order details carefully enough to ensure it was correctly captured and instead of working with him to come to an amenable solution you got petty.

As a custom designer, you're going to learn that the customers don't always know the ins of outs of all the details of the thing they want.  You should have a clause on your contract that specifies how issues like this will be handled."
bwr9nh,"NTA. You wanted to make a less toxic and more serious place for you and others, that itself isn’t even an a hole move. Also, it’s good to branch out and not stay so straight laced. You do you, man. The others were just too salty"
bwrcig,"NTA. Even if it wasn't as important of a commitment that you had (let's say you just promised a friend you'd have breakfast with THEM that morning) then you'd still nbta. You made prior plans, they didn't respect that, or allow you to have time to change your plans"
bwrd29,"I always take NTA stance on this. The sidewalk is to be treated like a road, and the pedestrians are cars. It's okay to walk holding hands, but as soon as someone is coming you break hands and make room. My husband and I do it just fine and it hasn't ruined our lives. People who can't do that need to grow up. NTA."
bwrf8v,NTA. You didn’t make the new rules.
bwrfyk,"NTA: This is ridiculously dehumanizing, and I think you should have walked out of, not only that meeting, but your job, while leaving bad reviews on Glassdoor and Indeed. Warn people against this type of bullshit."
bwrga7,"YTA - clean up entails everything the machine effects, not just the actual machine itself. She’s not asking you to clean up all the tables in the house, just the countertop the coffee machine rests on."
bwrhv2,"NTA for not helping. If it's not for your grade, you shouldn't have to do it. It's nice that you wanted to help your friend, but in the long run it looks like you've hurt her. Maybe if she actually did her work she would be able to get her English certificate."
bwrldi,"Do you need to announce right at 12 weeks? Would it be worth waiting just to avoid hassle? I don’t like fighting with people so I might wait just because it made my life easier.

You can't be racist for having a regional accent, and when a lot of races live together in one region, it's only natural that accents will begin to merge."
bwrow4,"YTA. No matter how you feel about this girl, it's not ACTUALLY your business as to who she's seeing/if she's seeing anyone. Your co-workers did not owe you that information."
bwrpba,"NTA. (Not a parent) but it seems really rude to *assume* you would get one present per invitee. That’s like expecting 2 presents from a (married) couple or a set of grandparents, or any other combination of people. Maybe someone is tight on finances and can only afford one present, a card, or maybe a gift card or cash. Teaching/encouraging your child to expect a certain number of gifts is just going to make them entitled."
bwrrfh,"NTA, but it is odd that they keep accusing you of misbehavior. Are there other tenants? If not, I'd consider relocating to a place with a different LL."
bwrt27,"Nah - I think you are an overprotective / controlling first time parent which is quite common. 

If you do not like the way she handles your infant, then don't leave him in her care?"

bwrzcg," “it wasn’t about her but our child. If she couldn’t understand that, then she really wasn’t ready to be a godparent to anyone.”

bwsbu9,"NAH

This is probably the mother of all non-issues"
bwscvp,"Broadly speaking NAH. Sounds to me like your parents tried to project their grief onto you which seems understandable to me since losing a child must be absolutely heartbreaking. At the same time you can't be expected to just lie like that just because, but it might make them happier.

bwskgn,"NAH - You said it yourself. You do not have a close, tight nit family. You have a family that interacts with each other at Christmas and thanksgiving. I understand where you are coming from but you also aren’t making efforts to do things with them either to build that bond that would make them want to participate in your event."
bwslnt,"NTA because you were being honest in the review.  She treated you poorly and then didn't apologize, so I think it's fair that you let other people know what she did."
bwso48,"This shouldn’t even be a question, YTA. You sat there, watched your parents insult his culture and ethnicity in silence, and now you want him to continue hiding who he is?"

bwsqbq,"NTA  This person is a bully, and probably lied to the counselor to get lunch detention instead of suspension."

bwssec,"NTA, you are not an asshole. If he is abusive to your mother and you, he has not earned your trust or love. You owe him nothing."
bwsvru,"NTA, but I’d suggest just being courteous and giving him a heads up as to why you’re uncomfortable with him."
bwsvvx,YTA because you gossiped with Jack instead of contacting Kyle first.
bwsx1u,"Whenever anyone writes ‘flash forward’ on these things, I immediately know it’s fiction."
bwsxjg,"YTA- 

If these girls are looking for something long term, then you’re deliberately misleading them. They could be getting their hopes up for someone to date, and then eventually you’re going to have to tell them the news and it’s going to hurt their feelings that 1) you straight up lied to them 2) now you’re leaving. 

Eventually this is going to come out, so what exactly are you trying to gain? Are you trying to get laid without telling them and just disappear after? That’s the only situation in which this would work, and that would really make you an asshole."
bwsy8s,"NTA and he is.  Let your supervisor know that this man is making you uncomfortable.

EDIT: for people suggesting you talk to him about it- I say that you should not.  It is not your job to teach him how to behave appropriately in the workplace.  it is not your responsibility to protect his career.  If he is making you uncomfortable through gross actions he does of his own choice, you do not owe him anything.  Go to your supervisor and be honest.  He will not loose his job over such minor infractions, at worst he will receive some ""training"" on the topic of how to behave like a non gross ass human.  

Good luck, and be well."
bwsyk8,"NTA... You deserve to keep the camping gear, based on everything that you have said happened. Enjoy it!"
bwszgf,"NTA on both counts. He was putting your personal safety at risk. They didn't handle it appropriately. Someone is protecting this nimrod, and you absolutely should escalate it."
bwt1rg,NTA. If the mom wanted the bride to know she should not get you involved and definitely not blame you for not saying anything. You gave your friend the happiness she has been waiting for. You should not have been put in that spot to begin with.
bwt3n0,"NTA-

It’s time she figured out how accountability works. If you move, you need to make plans and organize/pack. While asking friends and family for help is fine, there’s a line drawn. Becoming an adult means renting Uhauls and packing up your stuff on your own, as well as being there for others if you expect them to be there for you!"
bwt40c,"NAH for bringing up your concerns to her, you care about her and her children and you're just looking out for them. She is an adult and can do what she pleases whether it's a good idea or not though, so I wouldn't push the issue anymore."
bwtf84,"YTA. You and her mom agreed on her name. You’re an asshole if you try to change it years later just because you’re breaking up. And even if you don’t care about going back on your word, fighting with your coparent about her name will set an awful precedent for your daughter. You two still need to be a team."
bwtfbh,NTA -  he’s your bio brother but not your real brother in that you didn’t grow up and bond together like most brothers.   Totally understandable.  Hope things get better for you bud.
bwtjv6,NAH. I think you put your foot in your mouth a little bit with 'Huh? I did?' but that doesn't make you an asshole.
bwtk4o,"NTA, at all. You probably have misplaced guilt from the way you were raised. You don't own them anything. Keep up your boundaries and be aware that at some point they may use their financial contributions to manipulate you. Do NOT let them. Do NOT put yourself in a situation where you need their help to survive, but your not an asshole for accepting financial assistance."
bwtkz7,The time you spent writing this could have been spent practicing the cello.
bwtom5,"NAH - it sounds like he’s just not aware you’re struggling, but you have also hidden that from them and not communicated that you’re struggling with them.

At this stage I’m saying no ones being an asshole, but you need to communicate with them and depending on their reaction after and yours that may determine who is an asshole."
bwts0k,"NTA. Better for the kid to learn now when the stakes are low (not getting a popsicle) versus charging the wrong dog and getting mauled.

bwtuvs,"NAH.

funerals are for the living, not the dead. in this case, the funeral would create a lot of stress for you, and i'm sure that's not what your grandpa would want. 

that said, you may be perceived to be an ass."
bwtv2m,"YTA. She suggested a trip to see family, you agreed to go in a trip to see family...now you’re mad that it’s a trip to see family. If you’d said ‘I’m interested in going if we can also do some non-family stuff together’ that’d be different, but you didn’t communicate that at all."
bwtvu6,NTA- What you are saying comes from the heart and makes sense. That being said as a 19 yr old who struggled in middle school I would NOT do this. His (already low it seems) confidence will plummet and will start newer issues.
bwtvza,NTA- good for you for focusing on school so you can get out! Tell your brother you are not his maid and your mom shouldn’t  be throwing anything at you.
bwtwcl,"NAH she gets to choose what she calls herself around the kid.  You get to call her whatever you want.  There’s no reason to be rigid about this, the kid will happier if you don’t sweat the little things, and this is one of them."
bwu04s,"NTA, obviously. No one in their right mind could blame you for changing the name."
bwu3an,"NAH\*. If they ever actually come up to you and say ""you're a bad friend for doing that"" even then you're still not the asshole. If they never come up to you, then you'll just have to continue to work on getting over your own doubts and just have fun your own way.

You also talk about them like they ""just wanted to take pictures and lay around"" like that's a bad thing. Maybe they love pictures the way you love scuba, there's no need to judge them like that, which to me means it's possible you're projecting a little here too."
bwu632,"NTA - You're uncle has a right to know who he is marrying before he does, she played stupid games and is about to pay the Pied Piper"
bwu67u,"NAH

Yes, you should lighten up, but this is such a trivial thing that no one is the asshole."
bwu8na,NTA she deserves to know
bwu9ix,"NTA, but I think it's his mother you should be more mad at. He made you uncomfortable and crossed your boundaries, even if he didn't know better. It sounds like you know it's not his fault, though, and also sound like you blame his mother for not looking out for him more."
bwuao2,[deleted]
bwuef2,"So I think NTA but with some caveats.

Have you considered that maybe you don't want a relationship with this kid because your parents have set up a weird family-relationship nightmare? That you're justifiably anticipating some fallout? 

Your parents have conducted themselves pretty horribly all around. Being upset they couldn't have the ""son they've always wanted"" after having two wonderful daughters? Telling your aunt not to abort, but only because the kid could have been a boy? Lying to your aunt about emigrating him to the US to leaving her with literally all the childcare? Making her lie to the kid about his parentage? And just giving her money to maintain an illusion and lying to her about how the kid would be cared for? 

This is... man, it's all bad.

I get not wanting to partake in what your parents have done here, 100 percent. The kid is your cousin, not your brother, and your parents have built a stupid sandcastle of lies that will eventually be washed out by the sea. Youre not liable for any of this. At the same time, he's just a kid and he hasn't brought any of this on himself.

Have you maybe tried just going to therapy, OP?  Talk to a professional about your parents' abysmal conduct and all the complicated feelings around it. Really. You do not deserve to have to sort through this on your own."
bwuerq,"NTA. Your car, your rules. He should’ve done what you asked (you were going to pay him back anyway) or had a reason why he couldn’t and communicated that respectfully."
bwug8l,[deleted]
bwujfy,I say NTA because this is on his parents. It’s crazy that he’s caused damage and they DGAF. He’s their responsibility and they don’t seem to care so definitely not your fault.
bwukw2,"NTA - you don't give ""gifts"" for the acknowledgement or gratitude. That said, this seems like your Husband should be the one trying to reach out letting them know there is a letter in the mail and that you did super appreciate their gesture - I am not sure why you are the one running around trying to make amends."
bwupc7,"NTA, she is an infant, she won’t remember any of it and it will only be a hassle for you guys."
bwuqq1,NAH. If you're diabetic there isn't much you could do differently.
bwuse1,"NAH

You aren't excluding her of she doesn't want to go. Arrange a day trip and a road trip, invite her to both, if she comes she comes. Problem solved."
bwushx,NTA you owe her nothing.  Any guilt you have now will be replaced with regret when she does **something**
bwuuy2,"NTA you roof your rule. I think you are being harsh though. And this will definitely not stop him smoking, I’d imagine it will have the opposite effect."
bwuwme,"NTA. Do realize though that your sister is in a pretty manipulative, emotionally abusive relationship with this “man”, so her behaviors towards you (not sticking up for you, etc) are a result of this."
bwv17p,NTA rehome the husband.
bwv8fi,"NTA. Gross. They're violating your right to NOT watch ppl do shit like that when you're chilling with them. I've always felt weird about PDA. Your friend needs to grow some respect.  


Edit: Wanted to ask... are we talking about like, making out in front of you for long periods of time while you're just chilling there? Or like, making out trying to be low key about it but your friend is there... you know what never mind either way you're NTA"
bwv9zz,"YTA - Perhaps you need some therapy or something because your hostility towards your parents is a bit overwhelming.  

>I get they want to hear about my day. But somethings are mine to think  and talk about. I don’t want to relive the bad things that happened  today for your curiosity.   Work is over now.

You live in your parents house, they get to ask you about your day.  It's called participating in the social order of the household.  Perhaps if instead of coming off as an entitled spoiled brat you could talk to your parents and find out that they could help you deal with your issues.  My guess is though that they just want to be involved in your life, which you apparently find irrational (although you admit your acting like an ass because you expect parents to ask these types of questions). 

Also, ""respect my consent"", GTFOOH with that.  You don't have to tell your parents a hooker gave you a venereal disease but you also don't get to shut them out of your life.  Unless your paying market rate rent in your area, your obligated to either participate in family discussion on 'non critical issues' like how was work, or move out and be a brooding angsty asshole somewhere no one will ask you how your day was. 

TL;dr - You know your an asshole, your life isn't that sensitive, and your a mooch.  And if it was that sensitive you sure as hell need to talk about it because this asshole parade thing your doing isn't working."
bwvfhc,"NTA, but I would talk to your dad about it before the ""friend."" Like, hey Dad, this dude has been a shit friend and stabbed me in the back, can you stop letting him in when he comes over here?"
bwvijd,"NAH, but I think a funny answer to drop the conversation would be: ""I don't know, I stopped measuring after 6'!"" 

Or something cheesy, I don't know, I'm not a comedian."
bwvjcm,"NTA

You basically told him that you only want kids with him if he can commit to aiming to be a *good* parent. He is trying to use ""normal"" to lower the bar for parenting. Even if he thinks hurtful comments and behavior are the norm, shouldn't he want to aim for a Pollyanna family too?

Edit to add: the Pollyanna thing is also making me laugh because of how Pollyanna was an unwanted orphan who's aunt made it very clear that she only took Pollyanna out of duty. Like, the book was about turning a very broken family into a happy one so it's kind of ironic choice for comparison."
bwvjg6,NTA. She needs to learn how to communicate without first being rewarded for attention seeking behavior.
bwvjss,"NTA - you’re paying for your phone and honestly it sounds like your mom was kinda power tripping by taking it.
I mean you’re cleaning the house and helping with bills and she wants to treat you like a child?
I’d say standing up for yourself was the right move. 
For reference are you over 18?"
bwvnyl,"YTA. You can't imagine how she feels, so I'll do it for you. She feels stupid. You knew this was going to happen for a lot longer than she did, and now she's wondering what stranger she was sharing a bed with that was plotting a breakup the whole time.

Breakups are messy, and they should be. It shows how two people are grappling with a new reality. You showed her that you were preparing for this reality for so long that you had to have been faking it for a while.

Edit: grammar"
bwvpqz,"NTA.

You are about to graduate and at that point, it is going to be up to you to decide what direction you would like to take your life in. After eighteen years, I think you have a pretty good idea of the pros and cons of the lives your parents have chosen. If that's not for you, you need to be proactive and start heading in your own direction after you graduate.

Telling your parents you don't want to go with them (if that's what you decide to do) will be a hard conversation, but it will not be nearly as hard or demoralizing as taking the easier road and staying connected to your parents and accepting a life you know won't make you happy.

Good Luck."
bwvsjh,"NTA. 

I’d never assume I’d still be receiving a gift (the ticket) after falling out with someone.

bwvw8s,"NTA. Boss gets a dollar, I get a dime, that's why I poop on company time."
bwvy8i,"ESH. The guy was a douche about it and over reacted, no argument there. But seriously, if she wanted you to play and other people there already made it clear that they didn’t want to listen to it, just go somewhere else. I like live music and all of that stuff but sometimes when you’re hanging out with friends and drinking and talking, you don’t want some random guy you don’t know to just whip out and start playing a guitar. 

Just randomly breaking out a guitar around a bunch of people you don’t know and starting to play unprompted and without asking if it’s okay is just kind of obnoxious to begin with, to not stop when people there have made it clear they aren’t interested just makes it worse. If she was the *only* one sticking up for you, it stands to reason that most of the people there didn’t want you playing, either. 

A good rule of thumb is that unless the people you’re with ask you to play, they probably don’t want you to. Especially if they don’t even know you.

Edit: Grammar"

bwwtm0,"so last night, some dweeb posted a ""haha gotcha!"" post, revealing that he'd posted two similar scenarios, gender swapped, to prove a bias within this sub.

bwwtzj,YTA - it’s $50. Let him have his little special moment with his child.
bwwu3j,"NTA - You should flat out ask her what makes her think that her verbally abusive behavior will get her and tell her that if she comes to your apartment, and that if you find out she's broken a window to get in or something that you're calling the police. I know she's your sister but you really need to be careful in this situation. You said you had to move away to get away from the abuse and now she's trying to hit you with it again. You need to put a stop to it before it escalates.

Edit: Reading this back to myself this sounds very demanding, and I'm sorry if it came across like that. I've been in a situation like this so it really irks me to read about her acting like my previous abuser."

bwx50u,NTA. Her attitude is a concern and the fact she’s drinking is also one and the fact she kept calling you a bitch. You sent her to work on a farm owned by family. I think having her get out for awhile is a good thing.
bwx6fx,YTA if you ignore it. Just text her what you put here about the day pass. It’s just $5 too btw. In my opinion that’s not enough to create issues with a friend.
bwx6ix,"NTA, Dan blows. I would usually say that you should mind your own business, but he made it your business when he told you about his affair while knowing you’re friends with his wife as well. Especially since she’s blaming herself. You could give Dan the opportunity to do it himself, like he should have when their relationship started suffering, but if he won’t I think she deserves to know the full context behind the end of her marriage."
bwx8ob,If she's contributing financially I think YTA.  I'd actually feel differently if you were married as that would help protect her investment if you were to break up  but as it is she'd loose everything she put into it even if your contributions aren't split exactly 50/50.
bwxfyc,"NTA and this title is misleading.

bwxgbb,"NAH.

It's a really hard decision. Pros and cons to each.

Your Dad could live another 20 years. 

Livers are special and will grow back to full size. You wouldn't be losing any vitality with the organ.

You could have complications. 

You could die. He could die. Surgery complications are real.

I think whatever decision you make needs to be informed and very carefully thought out and understood. Talk with your Dad's doctors. What quality of life would your Dad get back? What would his prognosis be?

Go from there. Good luck."

I'm transgender, and it is NOT f-cking easy. When I came out to my mom, she was supportive, but my other family wasn't. It sucks. You need to not force you brother to help you because it could cause him to resent you, and that would be like losing that pillar of support. I suggest finding someone else who IS supportive before telling your parents. Or you can do what I did and tell your parents and deal with the fallout later. 

You are an ass for forcing your brother to support you. That's not your decision to make.

I'm wondering if this is the first relationship happening within your friend set? It's pretty common for people to become a bit obsessed with each other and to constantly talk about each other, etc, so the fact that you've mentioned that makes me wonder if this is the first time it's happened to you."

There are bigger things happening in your family, and this is a good time to show that you are an adult.

How do you do that? By accepting this situation with grace and poise, not being childish about it, and forging ahead. You want this to be the big adulthood transition? Then make it one. Be mature, understand the world does not revolve around things like birthdays and presents, and move on."

bx1e5r,"NTA - no, you're not an asshole for being frustrated that some guy is constantly lying to you, telling these outrageous stories. It's irritating.

You are welcome to feel all the anger you like about this.

That said... to be lying like this, the guy probably has some hidden issues in his life that leads him to make these bad choices, that you might not be aware of. Try to have patience with him - he's probably really insecure on the inside.

I think that's why your friends aren't so het up about it - they see that he's just bullshitting harmlessly, and because he's not actively causing harm, they have patience for him that you don't. I don't think your friends are in the wrong here."

bx427p,"Yeah NTA. She went back on her word in order to take care of her fiancé and didn’t bother to tell you that she wouldn’t be coming or why. I think she is a factor because if you’re a fully fledged adult, it’s not exactly child abandonment, it’s just shitty. But if you’re a minor, it makes it way way worse, in my eyes."

bx47hq,"NTA. I know someone's husband that did this and it fucked them over for quite a bit. I'd go over a plan and at least give his current job two weeks.

bx47wu,"NTA, I did this a few months ago (my second year of uni too) and don’t regret it. I told the course convenor why I did it (I get along with him anyway so it was fine) but I wasn’t going to let people get a mark for something they haven’t done. 3 out of 6 of us made an effort, and got a decent mark for it. You shouldn’t need to pester people constantly to help in a group project. If they don’t want the grade, let them have it their way.

Edit- also if the work they did do was ripped straight off the internet, don’t use any of it, not even a bit of it, because turnitin or your unis equivalent will have you done for plagiarism and there is zero tolerance for it after first year."

Besides, if she was a good photographer, she would've had no problem sharing some samples from her portfolio."
bx48ny,"YTA - that is a truly heinous thing that you did. It had nothing at all to do with your sister, and she has clearly been carrying this guilt around ever since. You just made that so much worse for her. I suggest you do absolutely everything in your power to try to ease her burden, but you can never take back what you said.

You must know that there is nothing she could have done - aneurisms are fucked up things, and it either happened on its own or when she fell from the sofa. Even if your sister had attended her immediately, nothing could have been done. And she did not prevent you from seeing her, you could easily have said ""no that's ok, I'll come by anyway"". It is utterly horrific that you would put any blame on her shoulders for this."
bx492c,NTA for what YOU did on YOUR birthday. They are being assholes for assuming they get to dictate YOUR day.
bx496s,"EDIT: YTA. See below.

I don't think you're TA, but I do see a couple of red flags here that make me think there might be some sort of history of favoritism towards the daughter - how you compare her to yourself as a positive or how you agreed to the rule exemption instantly (without talking with your co-parent). And I don't think talking about gender and age/maturity is likely to be a very convincing argument with teenagers.

So...I guess I just want to encourage you to tread with consideration for everyone.

Edit: I'm changing my judgment. OP's comments about her kids, dismissal of her son, etc. make me suspect she really is TA.

Edit 2: u/meerkitkats posted a brag about how she's clearly NTA when that was in the top voted response, but seems to have deleted it and gone silent in true TA fashion now that it's not."

I'd hate to see what people consider a heavy smoker.

TECHNICALLY you have the right to do this, but I think it does make you the asshole. Smoking cigarettes is clearly becoming a cultural faux pas. It's gross, it's unhealthy and it's generally looked down upon, forcing your neighbors to have to smell it - despite it being fully within your rights to do it - I do believe makes you the asshole.

bx4pd6,"YTA Let her make payments.

Just so you know, during Fall and Spring semesters tuition is not usually due until the first week of classes.  But for summer term, some universities require tuition to be paid the day you register.  Many students don't realize this until they register and get a bill instantly.  So it is very possible that your SIL thought she'd be able to pay it over the next several paychecks.  Of course all the policies are on the school's website, but few college students actually take the time to read the details.

Also...just get used to it.  Let your wife be an equal partner and make financial decisions.  Talk to her and agree to some amount above which you'll talk to each other before spending, and below that amount just keep your mouth shut.  Think of it as the (very low) price to pay for keeping a happy marriage."

However, without proof of purchase, those are hers because they're in her house.  She has every right to sell them since they have been abandoned.  The dog, after biting someone, can easily be shown as a safety risk and could be put down unless claimed by the owner and properly kept.  Not that I would put the dog down, but again it sounds like it was acceptable, legally.  Sorry, friend, this is just a screwy deal.  You can be pissed, but that's all."

bx5h9g,"NTA 

No one deserves to be ""stepped on"" or mistreated by someone that calls themselves your friend. 

This guy just wants to be popular and wants to be an alpha and he's willing to do anything or step on anyone to get there. He doesn't seem to care a great deal about you or your feelings he just wants to have social status it's not uncommon in Jr. High and High School, I dealt with people like that but don't let them confuse you into thinking they are your friend. 

He may have been a genuine friend at one point in your lives but he made the decision that social status and popularity meant more to him than friendship. 

Don't let it bother you there are a lot better people out there and people that would be a true friend to you, cherish those and brush off people like him."

bx5sy0,"YTA. You agreed that he could have *his* cat back once he had somewhere to keep the cat. It’s not your cat, and never was. You *assumed* you would get back together and, now that you realize you’re not, you are being vindictive. Just because you feel bitter about the breakup does not give you a right to his pet. 

(And trust me I’m not saying I don’t understand where you’re coming from. You’re hurt and so you want to hurt him the same way you feel he hurt you. I have been cheated on. I really do get it. But this is *not* the way to handle it and if you don’t let him have his cat back you may even get a legal battle on your hands.)"

bx5vaq,NTA people who lie about or exaggerate mental illness (or physical ones for that matter) suck and make it truly hard for people who genuinely suffer from an ailment. Mental illness especially is not fodder for people who want to seem edgy/ interesting / quirky
bx5wpv,"This isn’t really the place for this question, but ignorance isn’t an excuse for being an asshole. For example, you have no idea what kinds of experiences the people around you in that classroom have had with the subject. Some could be staunchly pro-life, some could have had to be faced with the decision of having an abortion or not, you simply dont know. So it was really not an appropriate joke to make in the circumstances. Also, you must be super ignorant if you honestly didn’t understand before now that its obviously a controversial topic.

bx6c1j,"NTA, but I wouldn't give up on the kids entirely.  You grew out of wanting to emulate your brother; just because they take their parents' word as gospel now doesn't mean that'll always be the case.  If that day comes, it might be helpful to have a ""cool aunt"" - or at least one who's left the lines of communication open via the occasional card or present - to turn to."

bx6j4u,"NTA, unless you made her so mad she didn't pay you and only declared bankruptcy to avoid paying you. Then you just didn't play it smart."
bx6kpd,"NTA for inviting her, but YTA for calling her out on being moody and than giving her that piece of information that she's only there by association. Not necessary, you could have ignored her moodiness and tried to enjoy your time with other friends. Instead, you called someone out for being moody without knowing what even caused it. Maybe she shouldn't have came if she wasn't in a good mood, but maybe your good friend wanted some company. Your decision to be confrontational has lost you a friend."
bx6pvm,[deleted]
bx6pyu,"NTA. You should be pushy about it. Your social media presence is what you want it to be, not your mother. I have had similar arguments with some family members too - not over posting them, but taking them of me constantly, and without my knowledge. Stand your ground."
bx6rsj,"You need to learn to cope with this whole situation. Some people are dicks. There will always be dicks. You have to learn to deal with them.

Better out than in, I always say. NTA"
bx6tyo,"NTA. I have a friend who constantly invites other people to our plans (including plans that we specifically made so that the two of us could catch up one-on-one). I agree, it's really annoying.

I don't think you'd be the asshole, but it would also be tactful to go about it by explaining how much you were excited to see her one-on-one and ask her if you can plan a dedicated hang out just the two of you in the future. That being said, that's definitely a ""high road"" tactic that you're not compelled to do."
bx6u3c,YTA. You made it with the intentions to share so just go ahead. I bet you'd take your ball and go home if you were picked last.

YTA - your roommate is upset that you are not parenting your kids and that you are not paying rent. Both of these things make him totally justified that he wants you gone.

Also I would hardcore want someone out of my house *that points a gun at my guests!* That is not small ""shit""."
bx73jn,"NTA, and if you were married to someone before, why would you be required to get rid of all the pictures?  Just because you are no longer with that person doesn't mean you didn't have any times together you may want to reminisce.  Many people keep pictures of their exes.  My husband has several from his first marriage that are ones where he was on vacation and stuff.  Should he not be allowed to look at them and remember his once in a lifetime trip just because his ex was in it?  You had a past, it didn't work out, and now you are with someone else.  That doesn't invalidate your past experiences.  This person sounds way too controlling.  Your ex was a part of your life, even if she no longer is.  There is no reason for you to be expected to erase the time you spent with her.  Years from now you may want to look back at those and reminisce.  People grow up and like to look back at things.  If we threw away every picture we had that had an ex in it, we'd lose a lot of life memories."
bx73mi,"NTA.  You did message her...with the address...before lunch.  You also waited an extra 30 minutes.

This is one of the hardest posts to judge that I've seen but I'm going with YTA. By lying to your sister, you caused her to stress herself out so much that she cried over it, and after she had a breakdown you still refuse to tell her the truth? Art school is nowhere near as intense as med school, they're two very different types of environments. She has no need to be that stressed.

I think your sister is acting a lot like me in high school; I never really did that well in high school, I didn't do terribly but my overall average was an 87 (or a B+). In college, though, I was able to test out of math and focus on taking classes in my major that I actually cared about, so I've been getting nearly straight As. Your sister is probably unmotivated now because she doesn't care about whatever she's learning in high school. I bet she'll start doing a lot better once she gets to college and learns about stuff that interests her."

I think after 4 years they probably think of you guys as ""mostly married"" and sharing everything (money, home, etc.) which is pretty damn presumptuous, but I could see why they'd assume she'd be able to swing it financially somehow. 

In a perfect world she would have spoken up and explained that's where you two were planning on going and have been saving up for... and maybe could they choose a less-expensive place so she could *possibly* do both vacations without making you go totally broke. 

This is a tricky one. Good luck, hon.

There is a base rate for utilities. The bill isn’t zero even if you’re not using it. 

You have to pay the base rate even when you are away from home to avoid them disconnecting your house (and costly reconnection fees).

Your roommate shouldn’t have to pay the base rate on their own. Maybe you could negotiate not to pay the per use amount as you won’t be using any. But you should absolutely contribute equally to the base rate (which incidentally is normally most of the bill).

For example for my electric base rate is $35 and usage amount is $5."

She also has an inability to empathise just like your friend. Whenever you come to her with issues she shuts down and is completely useless but expects all the sympathy in the world when she had problems. I don’t mind her behaviour as much because I have plenty of other people to talk to, but if it’s really bothering you then taking a break from her is a wise decision.

Service dogs are necessary to the people they support. You would be placing your discomfort with dogs (when service dogs are extremely quiet, well behaved, and well trained) over the persons need to be healthy and safe. I would not visit your house if I had a service dog in the first place with that kind of attitude.

A service dog is NOT an emotional support animal.

A service dog can be any of these things - a guide dog for the blind (would you tell someone to leave their eyes outside?) for hearing impairments, with mobility assistance (you are going to take away someones dignity by telling them they have to leave their mobility service dog outside so you can physically carry/assist them around your house?), diabetic alert dogs (can you smell blood sugar changes before it leads to a problem?),  seizure alert dogs (can you tell when someone is going to have a seizure before they have it?), allergy detection dogs (what if that bowl of cashews on the coffee table has peanuts in it and you offer it to your deathly allergic guest but you've made them chain up their dog who senses that outside, so then they die in your house?)

YTA for even asking someone to give these forms of assistance up when the dog will just sit quietly next to them unless something is going wrong and then has a specific system of alerts, all because you're uncomfortable with dogs. Please don't insult someone with a genuine service animal by asking them to leave it outside.

Once again, emotional support animals are different so if that is what the person is telling you it's not really the same level of training... service dogs can be considered a life or death need or a need for human functions such as mobility, sight, or hearing..."

If you don't want to get in trouble, don't do stupid things, and especially don't post stupid things to any form of social media. While she may be your sibling/twin, she is still responsible for her own actions. 

You're opinion of her friends, however, should probably be kept to yourself. As a teenager once myself, being the ""wrong crowd"" is a temporary thing. Most teenagers grow out of it if it is allowed to progress naturally. Parental/sibling interference (unless legit drugs/illegal activities are involved) only forces people away from where they would find safety if shit went south.

OP failed to mention that it is not her roommates girlfriend, but her landlord's girlfriend. Yes, he owns the house together with her boyfriend.

OP - you cannot dictate whether your landlord charges his girlfriend rent, you cannot complain about your landlord's girlfriend staying with him in his house rent free, and you certainly cannot dictate what your landlord spends his rent money on. Your boyfriend could complain about the wasted resources, seeing as it's his house too, but you really need to learn (and be more upfront about) your place in this situation.

...

ESH - it's really not your place to enforce rent rules on someone else. Unless her living there is somehow costing you extra unanticipated money then it's none of your business how often your roommates girlfriend stays over.

Also, shouting ""fuck you"" and storming out is extremely childish and will not have won you any favors whatsoever. In fact, it probably just gave you even less of a leg to stand on.

That being said, asking someone to leave their own apartment is a shitty thing to do."
bxibla,NTA - Was already to go with a yta because more often than not I think people getting pissed of at other people speaking different languages is absurd. But here if they are indeed specifically saying the word 'chinita' whilst looking at you I think you are ok to be concerned
bxid4m,"NTA.

Have fun being married to that."
bxidv8,"YTA, he owes you the 50 & nothing more"
bxif63,"NTA

If she didn't even bother checking the animal shelter even once in five months, she clearly didn't want the cat (considering calling the animal shelter is one of the first things you do if your pet goes missing).

You absolutely just ignore this woman's antics.  If anyone asks, then you can tell the story ""I went in to the shelter, saw a cat I liked, the animal shelter tried numerous times to contact the owner to no avail, so I was able to adopt Fluffy.  They're now legally my cat"".

If you can, get that cat microchipped in your name, just in case the lady tries anything.  It will be further proof that this is, in fact, your cat."
bxiobq,Nta. He knows the consequences of his actions he just doesn't care.
bxipde,"So, if you're resentful to your parents and we're abused by them why are you living with them."
bxiq4c,[deleted]
bxisu9,"NAH, I think. Did she send you a text that really should have been answered? Not responding to a question or request for plans is rude/what most people mean by ghosting. Neither of you saying anything and letting it fizzle out is fine."
bxit38,"NTA. It's natural to become desensitized to these things. There's probably a part of you that still cares, and as long as you don't straight up say ""I don't give a damn"" when she tells you she's in the hospital, there's nothing wrong with not being as concerned."
bxit8e,"YTA for stealing his property,  but probably NTA if his IG addiction is this bad and you feel you were saving himself from becoming a slave to it"
bxiuy4,"YTA, they want their baby to stop screaming as much as you do. I promise"
bxiuzf,"NTA , you have absolutely every right to keep her out of your life. your husband doesnt have any say in that."
bxiw2d,"NTA - did she not include the receipts so you can return yourself?  If not, just tell her the clothes don't fit so they need to be returned (I realize the jeans fit so just tell her you like how they look on you) and that you won't use the bar tools and would like to get air pods instead.  I think your mom will understand."
bxj1xr,"YTA, and a big one for me.

Your friends are not obligated to tell you something regarding another person especially one you hadn't been in contact with. They are not required to release personal medical information to you or your partner. It's not their place to spread information about your friend. Perhaps her family only wanted close friends to know.

You spent almost half a year not caring about her or wondering where she was/how she was - and you have the audacity to resent people for not telling you a personal tragedy that occurred?  You couldn't even reach out or check her Facebook? She she's supposedly one of your girlfriend's friends?

Maybe there's good reason no one told you. Stop being ultra, ultra petty and selfish. This isn't about you in any way. You probably feel guilty because you were a shitty friend to her prior to her accident and now need someone to blame something on."
bxj3fm,"YTA YTA YTFA.  Did you seriously just say it wasn't ""fair"" for you to be stuck in a lease?  Let me remind you that you signed it.  You are on the hook for rent for the remainder of the lease, unless she finds an acceptable replacement and removes you from the lease.  That is, acceptable to her, not you.  Welcome to Adulting.   In life, if someone makes a decision based on actions from you, you jump in and agree to those terms, then you are a huge asshole to break the agreement and dump extra expenses on them.  It is a dick move, and people agreed it was a dick move and made rules where you can be sued for that, thankfully."
bxj4wh,"ESH. Its for your dad and you're making it about you, get over yourself. Your brothers are dicks and should be confronted about this cuz seriouslyfuck then. Then again relationships are two way streets stop blaming your relationship with them on age difference and your personal emotional issues. If you are aware then attempt to fix it. Im not saying its easy but if people bring them up to you and you want to have a relationship with them try and fix it."
bxj5bh,"YTA, abso-frickin-lutely.  You have no idea what challenges black kids or their white foster parents face.  None.

Know who does and is personally trying to make them easier on people?  Your friend, if you still even have a friend at this point.

Such an A."

bxjg9i,"NTA... mostly because genetic testing is now becoming standard in cancer treatment and diagnosis, so if he really has cancer, he may already have the info.

Also, ancestry/23andme are all fine and good, but they have high false negative rates (esp 23andme for BRCA). If you’re actually medically curious go ask your doctor about medical-grade genetic testing.

Edit: for reference, I work at a company that does testing for medical genetic counseling."
bxjghg,NTA. You were kind to even entertain her request. Good on you for respecting your daughter’s boundaries/autonomy.
bxjmiu,"NAH.  If she hasn't asked, you're under no obligation to volunteer.  If she asks, you don't have to say yes.  That said, the cat's not going anywhere.  If this relationship has a future, you might want to figure out how you're going to get to a point where you can at least tolerate its presence."
bxjovz,"Nta, honestly the good samaritan thing to do woud be yo give her husband all your screenshots and evidence of her crazy manipulative  behavior.  If they have kids, she will most assuredly use them as pawns to hurt/take advantage of the father.  Sounds like husband did what he could, this woman is just not happy."
bxjsev,"NTA. -  They're both adults, and they have a right to be seeing whomever they want. But that fact that they specifically *hid* it from you gives you every reason to feel betrayed, and they knew what a betrayal it was, shown by the fact that they've been keeping it a secret. But I'd suggest cutting off contact for a week or so, then make the decision about whether or not to continue with no contact. Once somethings been said, it can never be *un*said.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just because the friend and OP's mom have the **right** to see each other, doesn't make it *right*. I'm not defending them, just suggesting that them being honest and upfront could have at least made it so OP didn't have to feel lied to for however long this has been going on. Overall, this is a really bad situation for OP and I can't imagine being in their shoes and having to deal with it."
bxjsgx,"NTA.

I assume you either earned or are paying for this class. Sometimes you need to do what it takes to succeed. Hopefully you've learned she isnt cut out for that level of material. Seems like she lacks even a fundamental understanding of what you were doing."
bxjvni,I have no clue what's going on here. NTA? I think? Why did he call you racist? Were the memes racist?
bxjw8i,"NAH - what did he think he had ""dibs"" on her? Also doesn't really sound like you stole anything yet either since it sounds like you have just been talking, though it does sound like she is interested."
bxjztp,"NTA.

But understand you may ruin this relationship forever. It's taken personally when family isn't invited. Especially family as close as grandparents. It sounds like the worst she'd do is make a couple insensitive comments. And you likely wouldn't spend most of the day with her anyway. Is it worth possibly ruining that relationship and anyone who may stick up for her, to save the discomfort of a couple comments?"
bxk1o8,NTA. If people want to be there they will be happy to do so! Especially when you have said no gifts

bxk5ga,"NAH. 

He is having caregiver burnout, which is very common. He is dealing with his own stress related but probably feels like he can reciprocate sharing his feelings. You aren’t wrong for talking about your frustrations, but sometimes it is easy to lose sight of the effect that can have on your loved ones. Just talk about what both of you need in this situations. Sounds like you guys have a good relationship and have just hit a bit of a rough patch."
bxk6ka,NAH.  She could just as easily fake the Spike and tip it right over your head. Im a tall male with athletic build and I've been destroyed in volleyball by women before.  Finesse can beat brute strength most times. Play your best game and let them play theirs.
bxk6kp,"YTA. Just slightly.

A quick ""How'd I do"" is fun and cute. A ""On a scale from 1 to 10"" just sounds like someone's insecure and wants their hookup to do homework. So maybe don't do it anymore?"
bxk6lb,"NTA - they were deliberately misleading, and anyone else could have figured it out themselves anyway."
bxk733,YTA for the validation post.
bxk7pe,"NTA - What you said was mean, yes, and you know that. But she definitely shouldn't have misgendered you for a shitty dig during a fight, and she DEFINITELY shouldn't have doubled-down when called out"

bxks4w,"NTA IF you are just getting it to match your kids last name. Not having the same last name as your kids can cause a lot of stupid problems with the law and schools and stuff. If he doesn’t want you to take their last name then he needs to agree to hyphenate. If he won’t do that take your kids last name. It’s not about him, it’s about you and your kids."
bxksd6,"NTA, you made an objective decision where one needed to be made. That's what being a captain is. Just the fact that you feel compassion for her shows that you really care about her but this situation wasn't about you and it wasn't about her. It was about the team. And you did what is right for the team."
bxkt9x,"YTA. Not because this is racist, but because this is extraordinarily annoying and I consider it very possible this is just your mom's way of trying to get you to change your ringtone before she smashes your phone with a hammer."
bxkuyh,"NAH. It's okay to distance yourself if her presence hurts you because of your feelings for her. However, don't ghost her, at least explain that you need time to get over it."
bxkvso,NTA.  He seems unreasonable
bxkxet,"Honestly I'm compelled to say you're NTA just because you're being considerate enough to think this through before going to town on this thing. Chat with your housemates and see if there's a time of day when they're not home or they don't mind the noise. Chances are if they have a TV or music on, they won't hear you anyway. If they say no, try practicing outside if the weather is nice, or if you're in university and your school has a music department, seek out a practice room. They can usually be reserved for specific times, are mildly sound proofed, and they literally exist for students to practice their screechy notes. Have fun!"
bxl14u,"NTA, but what do I know?  I’m just an unprofitable woman"
bxl1m5,"YTA - Your daughter is fine, and honestly does not need to be punished (I even applaud her restraint for just hiding the glasses instead of breaking them).

The problem here is you and your wife allowing an environment where such bullying goes unaddressed within a family setting for years, despite you knowing the history here. The only reason i'm not sticking an ""*Everyone Sucks*"" tag on this for the other parents, is that you got to see first hand what your and your wife's reaction should have been for years to Becky."
bxl69q,YTA.  You can't even carve out an hour to support your family?  Even if Church isn't your thing you still need to go to this once in a lifetime special event for the sake of family bonding.

bxl7it,"In what world would you be an asshole for not wanting to be around somebody that is abusive?

If you're mom already knows he is abusive and refuses to leave, then I don't see what you could do to change it. See if she'll talk to a therapist."
bxl924,NTA. Take care of yourself.
bxlcaf,"NTA - You have the right to actually question your friends. Speak to them, ask them: ""Why are you having a party with my abuser present, and who invited him?"". If it's not their party, I get it - they can't control who comes. But inviting you to a party with your ex who abused you is grounds for friendship termination in my book."
bxlky9,Dude I think you just need to get over this girl and let it be.

And they did, the first few times you burst into tears.  After that, you were being a distraction to the rest of the employees and rather unprofessional.   I get going to the walk-in to have a moment, but then you suck it up and get back to doing your job.   You could have freaked out all you wanted when you were off the clock."
bxm3ii,"NAH.  I don't think you are an asshole but you should stop doing it because

Also, she sounds like a moron but not an asshole, hence the judgment I gave."
bxm3pt,"NTA all you're trying to do is play the game with him. If he's trying to win, no offense, why is he playing with you, knowing you're not good? You have offered to not play with him anymore, yet he still plays with you. He knows you're not good, and yet still plays with you and gets pissed and talks shit when you don't do good and lose. Something makes me believe that you don't deliberately try to lose and it's shitty to accuse you of doing so. Therefore, you're NTA"
bxm5u0,"NTA - it irks me when people with kids expect other people to foot the bill for them.  I’m not sure how you’re dividing up cost, but I usually do it by room or beds when dealing with a lot of people.

I don't play sports so I'm not sure how many people will agree with me on this, but personally? If I was in John's shoes and knew what you did, I'd be more insulted than anything else. I'd rather lose a game fairly than win because someone on the other team felt sorry for me. Also, your teammates are right! It was incredibly selfish of you to screw your team out of the title like that."
bxm9e0,"NAH - if you are absolutely certain that you have no problem lifting 60lb weights around all day long without holding anyone else back, you're not an asshole. I know I could not, and we're about the same height/weight.

The employer could have given you a shot to see what you could do, but he also has a duty to protect his staff. If he hired you and you were injured picking up something too heavy then suddenly he has to pay workers comp plus deal with a potential lawsuit. He probably figured it was best to play it safe and hire someone else.

Sucks, but I dont think anyone's an asshole here."

weddings are stressful to plan and i know it’s a cliche but maybe they forgot.. remember that your friend is also directly involved in the wedding (it’s his after all!) and he’s probably got a million other things to finalize before the 15th. everyone in the wedding party seems to be encouraging you to show up and telling you that you’re invited, so i really think you’re stressing over nothing. i would go! have fun at your friend’s wedding!"
bxn1cf,"NTA - OP has clarified that they only promised to stay until his friend's mother could get to the hospital.

~~ESH in my opinion.~~

~~on one side, you promised to stay until the surgery was done, and you didn't. on the other side, his mom was there at that point and there was absolutely no need for you guys to remain.~~

~~I'm more on your side than your friend's, and I do think it's ridiculous of him to keep bringing this up. You stayed with him all night, and only left once his mom was there to be with him.~~"

bxn4l1,"ESH, you are right in believing he should have told you how he really felt about you before having sex.

bxnc95,"NTA.  It sounds like you and your friend have an unhealthy relationship, and it might be better for both of you if you took a break from the friendship."

bxo8ce,"NTA- not at all. Go to HR or the highest level that you can and threaten legal action. Their willful negligence sounds illegal. They are enabling a man who has sexually harassed you and probably others. This is one of the few cases that truly warrants the nuclear option.

bxoc2k,"NTA. I do think you should be even more upfront, if she gets super attached, maybe let her know you don't feel like you should continue things.

bxpc1c,"NTA - mixing business and old friendships rarely works out well.  If she couldn’t handle the idea of waiting a bit, I doubt she could handle the full scope of what collaborating would entail.

Good luck with your new pursuit!"
bxpgyr,"NAH (except for your mom not protecting you etc, only judging this one specific interaction). She obviously feels extremely guilty, but you were honest and it doesn't sound like you said it in a spiteful way. 

&#x200B;

Also, isn't everyone in therapy because of their parents? ^((this is a small joke, not trying to downplay what you went through))"
bxpikz,"NTA, wow, your friend needs help. The meds she's taking aren't cutting it."
bxpinn,"NTA, tell your family if it would have meant that much they should have paid for the ticket"
bxpl1r,"YTA. You’re not entitled to park it wherever. Find a place to move it or sell it. I’m guessing she’s annoyed since you’re living with her and likely not paying for much, AND ruining patches of the yard for a housing unit you have no intention of using."
bxpmd8,"NAH. But please understand addiction doesn't always work that way. For many people, there really are no deterrents strong enough to make them want to quit. The drugs are stronger than that, and a lot of addicts don't really fear death while they're in the grip of addiction.

So while you can try (it would not be exploitive at all - it would actually be a way to honor the deceased), please don't be hurt if it doesn't work. Your friend will have to come to the decision to get and stay clean on his own."
bxpn79,YTA. Get her books. No such thing as too many books.
bxpooc,"NTA - your moms aren't even entitled to *one* thing they want at your wedding. It's your and your partner's day, and it sound like y'all are making the best decision for yourselves. Congrats!"
bxptgt,"YTA - as an ignored girl, I was always suspicious that attention was pity attention, and that's a pretty shitty mindset to get locked into."
bxptjj,"NAH 

It's fine that you want to be informed before your resume is shared around, and it's fine that your girlfriend tried to help you network/get a job. Now that you've communicated your boundaries (being asked before the resume is sent out) hopefully you'll be able to move forward with this.

Best of luck on the job search!"
bxptjv,"NTA. There are levels to PDA. If it was just a smooch here and there, you'd look immature for complaining. Biting each other's hands? Yeah, it would be appropriate to ask them to reel that back. Though you should expect pushback."
bxpxku,"ESH

But honestly....if you can't distinguish between  alarming smoke and hazy contacts.....you need to see a doctor. When we had our house fire, none of us needed anyone else to confirm, and we caught it pretty early. Standing there next to the room in question,  while yelling at your wife over yonder....that's pathetic."
bxq4yn,NAH - Just maybe talk to them and make sure they know it was a joke. When it comes to humor there's no accounting for taste.
bxq62w,"YTA in this one, I think. Unless you hate them for some reason, your family is more important than some video game. A wedding is just a few hours, you'll be able to play the game for years. Unless you just really don't give a shit about or want to be part of your family, go to the wedding."
bxqb03,"NTA,  this is none of her business. It's very unprofessional to bring it up repeatedly"
bxqbmn,"NAH, you have no obligation. You could have asked if her parents were ok with it if you were concerned she was alone"
bxqbzu,"YTA. Majorly. Your brothers life is in danger. It’s not like it was your money in the first place, it was generously being given to you. You want your brother to have a cheaper surgery? Maybe you could go to a cheaper school instead. This was probably an incredibly hard decision for your parents, and you feeling entitled to their money isn’t fair for anyone. Plenty of people take out student loans or pay their own way through college."
bxqcpn,"NTA. Your mother needs to get some legal help to get your sister back. Period.

Edit: Why the hell did your mother let your sister in the truck with him? I really need the story on this one ."
bxqgax,"NAH. Of course. 

Your wedding, your guest list. 

Also, do you really think he will be that hurt? Give him a bit of credit, I’m sure he won’t lose any sleep over not getting an invitation for an old coworkers wedding."
bxqjse,Yes. Anyone who cheats must be exposed regardless of consequences
bxqkou,"NTA. But....the hate isn't serving you. Holding onto hatred for someone who isn't around to feel it is like squeezing a ball of spikes in your hand and hoping it hurts someone else. 

I know it's really easy to say, but letting go of how you feel about your father will free you. 

And while I'm here, it's not your fault he died. His own poor decisions killed him. Let go of the guilt, I'm sensing you might feel some. You deserve to live your life out of the shadow. You display a lot of empathy by recognising the extenuating circumstances that led to your father's alcoholism. Extend the same sympathy to yourself."
bxqmek,"YTA- unless there’s more to the story, why couldn’t you just say “no thanks” to their recommendation and just go to your dentist of choice?"

bxrkos,"NAH I think they are trying say "" If I wanted to be rich I would of married another guy a long time ago not your brother"" Maybe they are worried people think he married your brother for money?

bxroqt,"Over here in the US we say, if you are good at it, never do it for free."
bxros9,"NAH - With the Harry Potter films, usually, parental discretion is advised. The parents must assess the child's maturity before deciding.

NAH because you both had different opinions on the child's maturity.

bxrt3q,NTA but you ans jane doe clearly have some compatibility and trust issues here.
bxs3ce,"She's gotta respect that this is your job, NevermindMoreInfoCameOutButOPIsNoTA. Do you have a private office? A closed door sends a message, but you could start by setting verbal boundaries.

bxsess,NTA dude...red flags you need to clear this way before marriage.

If anything the older sibling should be subjected to this ""lesson on money""."
bxslet,"YTA. If your work is flex, and its raining, and its your wife going to the doctor, don't be such a fucking asshole. Your wife literally missed medical care today because you couldn't be fucked to drive her there.   
Ok, maybe she could have organised a better time for it, or whatever, but dude - she missed MEDICAL CARE because you didn't want to take her. Let that sink in."
bxsop9,"NAH. 

He is trying to offer you help and advice. Although it seems condescending, maybe he isn't aware that he is being so.  Has he ever been told that he is?

When you talk about what you are doing, do you sound confident or do you sound like someone who would need/appreciate advice?

Maybe you can state that you have it all in hand as a preface when you tell your friends what you are up to."
bxsqd4,NAH - I don't think you're an asshole for not doing it but from the sound of it I don't think you've set clear boundaries with this friend so I think she may not be aware that you do this as a profession and that it's going to be brutal for her. If you try that and she still won't budge she is at least a small to medium sized asshole.
bxstl6,"YTA (well, really you and your Mom)

It would have been one thing if your GF had offered to swing by and pick up your brother - but she didn't.  You and your Mom both volunteered her for services that she did not offer.

You say ""you've not been guilt tripped"" like your Mom and brother won't both give her the stink eye for refusing to go 30 minutes out of her way to pick him up.  Chances are, they will - and she knows it.

Also, when she said ""I said I'd do it, you asked...I'm telling you"", you should have let it go rather than once again insisting how wrong she was in feeling guilted into it and then trying to convince her of why it's not a big deal."
bxsxpy,"YTA - you said you worked shifts. That means it wasn't just your boss you screwed, but the other people you work with on shift. People will have had to scramble to cover the work you were meant to be doing, making their days just a little shittier."
bxt1um,"NTA by any means, you made your wishes and requests in advance, and when the girl uses her mom as a get-out-of-jail-free card and essentiallys flips you the bird on the way out and leaves you with the work, shes the asshole. Im surprised the mother didnt say anything."
bxt5an,"NTA

You can still report him, you have all the evidence. And you should.

I am strongly against weaponizing calling out a gay, but that's not what you did: you called out a sexual predator for just that: sexually predatory behavior. The fact he groped you and send you nudes against your will doesn't even make him gay per se. He could be straight, bi or asexual and a sadistic pervert."
bxt6gk,"YTA. You say you try to stay out of drama, then describe a list of ways you go around stirring things up. That's starting drama, never mind getting involved in it...."
bxt7gw,NTA. How fucking childish of him. I wouldn't lift a finger for such a selfish brat. Make him cook his own damn food he's 26.
bxtdgz,NTA.  You don't know anything about her. She could rob you blind.
bxtfj9,Kind of borderline NTA here. You did say that you told them about your plans and everyone seemed to have shrugged it off. Multiple times. Announcing that they had plans on top of your plans quite show their interest in you. But the deed has been done and the money? Spent. Kind of understand if you do sulk a bit.

bxto93,"YWBTA 

Your coworker nailed it “Don’t like it, don’t work there.”

It was your responsibility to do due diligence before moving. Your boss is paying you so hours are their prerogative (within reason.) 

To strike a blow against their business because you’d prefer different hours is the only selfish suggestion I’m reading in your post."
bxtrp3,"YTA. Welcome to adulthood, where you have to pretend to care sometimes even when you (rightfully) don't."
bxtwu4,"YTA - You asked if you could add a +1 (for a woman you’ve been dating for ~2 months) to a friend’s wedding that’s 6+ months away.  Your good friend says essentially, “yes, and no worries if you want to change your +1 later to +0.”  

This is your good - best? - friend who also knows and likes the woman you’re dating.  He isn’t hoping for your breakup, just letting you know that he can accommodate you either way.

Is there something going on with your own life - or the new relationship or history of past relationships - where you’re feeling insecure?

Good luck with the new relationship - sounds like you’re very happy!  In the meantime, don’t put too much pressure on yourself, her, or your friends for it to all work out perfectly.

Edited: Grammar"
bxtz8z,"Moving just moves your problems.  it's ok to start a new life, but when you move you don't become a different person, you take all your baggage with you.  I think it's perfectly acceptable to distance yourself from toxic people, but leaving the country seems a bit rash"

Stop enabling them and kick them out. Most would have already gone no contact."
bxudk3,"ESH

Your friend was an asshole for exposing you to her illness, especially when she knew that you have had a difficult pregnancy and miscarriages in the past. You are an asshole because you should have immediately taken up this issue with her when it made you uncomfortable instead of being passive aggressive about the whole thing."
bxuecr,"I dunno, I don't think OP needs a quote-unquote good reason for not wanting a needy houseguest on her birthday. NAH."
bxug6w,"NTA. ABSOLUTELY not the asshole. If I knew the mother of my child was hiding something like that from me, I would want to know. Nicotine can cause serious health side effects. 

My fiance was actually conceived by accident, and her mom smoked throughout a good portion of the pregnancy because she didn't even know she was pregnant. Luckily, the only bones that my fiance is missing were teeth (I believe she has ~23 teeth compared to the normal 32). In less lucky circumstances, the bones missing would be fingers, toes, even whole appendages or key structural bones. It's never worth the risk, and I know quitting is hard, but if you can't quit for the health of your own child, then I'm sorry but you need professional help."
bxug9y,"NTA - Throw some wisdom her way ""you can get your own ride, you're old so you should be able to handle your own transportation now"" ;)"

NTA - If you wear a company shirt outside work hours then you are a representative of that company. 

Anyone seeing him and remembering the company name would think twice about having business dealings with them, which is not what the company needs.

If you want to be an ass, be an ass in your own clothes. If it was an employee of mine, I'd want to know.

You won't ruin his life. Hopefully he just gets a talking to."
bxul3h,"NTA.

You're planning on marriage and a possibly a future family, a long-haul relationship. If he even slightly believes he can do that on 1700 dollars every 8 months, then he's in the wrong relationship. You can't force him to quit, but you're in your own right to ask him."
bxumsi,"NAH, its your choice.  But the message the girls are sending is ""you're our father"".  The message you'll be sending back is ""you're not my daughters"".  Which is true, but could hurt a lot of feelings.  If its to do with your biological daughter that passed, that's understandable, but you're going to have to explain that to two girls you've raised for the last 12 years.  Good luck."
bxuven,"NAH - Start going for fresh air breaks. When someone questions you on it, mention the smokers."
bxuyja,NTA She hasn't had to pay rent for a whole year and is still in debt? Sounds like if she moved in she will never move out.

bxv2bc,"YTA and you sound like you need to work on your social skills. ""Female human beings"" is super cringe; they're people, not a separate species. And ""after meditating for a while"" you should realize that it was one date to see a movie that didn't even happen. 

She could have told you the truth but you're not her boyfriend. She doesn't owe you any explanation.

You're too young to be taking it this seriously. Relax, amigo."
bxv3q7,NTA. I would have been beyond embarrassed if one of my employees did something like that to a customer. It is completely inappropriate to detain a customer and he would have been fired in a heartbeat.

Sometimes you don't get a proper goodbye.  Don't wreck the good by pushing and pushing for a bow to tie the closure."
bxv9x6,"NAH. If you’re not comfortable then you’re not comfortable. I get why she feels like she’s granting you permission so that should fix it, but not wanting to remove money from someone else’s bank account is fine."
bxvaza,"YTA from her perspective and that's important in this scenario. You were expecting someone ""fat"" and instead got someone ""beautiful."" In other words, you just told her she was ugly when she was fat. And that if she gets fat again you'll think she's ugly.

bxvvk4,"NTA. I get where she's coming from but drugs like that need safe spaces. A huge crowd with a crappy friend group is not the place to experiment with mindbending drugs. She probably feels like you're accusing her of being untrustworthy or something. You're not treating her like a child, you're telling her a fact and she can ignore that fact at her peril."
bxvwj6,"NAH - you don't need to block him, but put him on mute so you don't get notifications every time he texts! Then pick a couple of times a day to catch up with his texts. As long as he's not getting pushy about you answering right away, then problem solved.

I think people forget that texting as a medium is MEANT to be used when you don't need a response right away. It's ok to ignore texts for a bit! If it's an emergency or you need an answer sooner...that's what FB is for /s :)"

He can’t just not have ANY involvement in the child’s life, and I told him this and that he will still contribute financially, and I will take him to court if I have to.""

Like...really? You *did* tell the guy that there was no chance you could get pregnant. And that's not your fault that you did. Nobody could have predicted this was the outcome. But then you can't get upset that he doesn't want to be in the child's life. Just like your ex husband didn't want to be with you because you couldn't have kids, this guy wanted to be with you for that same reason. I think making him be a part of the child's life would be detrimental for all parties involved."

bxxwqj,"NTA. I'm pretty amused how this thread is very divided by people that have kids and people that don't. Taking a 10 month old to a restaurant is a carefully choreographed act. The window of time before hunger and exhaustion make it a bad experience for everyone is short. Being 30+ minutes late is super inconsiderate under normal circumstances.

I will ALWAYS get the same students who do NOTHING during the time I provided complaining about how they didn't get enough time, and that I didn't help them. Giving in and letting them walk all over you will do them no service. As adults we want to teach kids to be responsible and it's OK for them to make mistakes, but they need to LEARN from them."

bxylx6,"YTA - Your wife seems like a wonderful person trying to use the support she can give others that need help with child care during the summer months to help fill the hole she feels about not having additional kids.   Forget your comments, you already know that you're the asshole for those.  You knew it the minute they left your mouth.    You are gone at work most of the hours that she does this it seems and sure, it overlaps a bit when you get home, but don't take this from her - in the end you'll regret it and your wife may even begin the silently resent you for it.  She's trying to find an avenue for the extra love she has to give children that she can't give to additional of her own.  Let her.  Apologize, support her and she'll be happier in the long run and so will you.

Former Barista, it’s hectic back there. Shit happens, we know we make mistakes. You should be the first priority before they keep going with orders, especially something as easy as plain old joe."
bxysiw,Is there a reason it had to be on her weekend and you couldn't wait for yours?
bxyx4x,"NAH but the first thing you learn in Al-anon (that's a group for friends/relatives of alcoholics) is that you can't change someone, you can only help once they made the decision to change. 

You can try talking to her about the situations in which she may be putting herself at risk instead of talking about the amount she drinks. Tell her you are concerned about that but if she dismisses it, just let it go. If you keep trying to make her stop drinking it will only push her away or make her hide some things from you. Make sure she knows you are someone she can comes to if she needs help but don't try to fix her problems for her, it won't work."
bxyxh9,"YTA.  7 AM is extremely early and disruptive to your neighbors.  It's a shame that you have these allergies, but mowing your lawn would be at everyone else's expense.  Could you mow after sundown?  What about protective clothing and a hat?  Look into hiring someone to come by instead of suffering from allergies and causing a problem with your neighbors."
bxyyxx,NTA. Why is it your job to entertain your sister's kid?
bxyzcr,"Ah well then if you’re finished school now, maybe you can get your own place. Even just renting a room from a friend might find you more suitable living arrangements. 

You’re not wrong, your siblings are being inconsiderate. It’s your approach to the conversation that got an ESH verdict."
bxz5xs,"NTA. I wouldn't personally want to go on a cruise with an infant. Some people make it work, but I wouldn't be one of them. Take the family issues out of the equation and I still wouldn't go. Maybe try to arrange a nice day with your mom where you do something nice with her after the cruise - a day trip that's closer to home or something. Then you can be more flexible and plan something enjoyable for both of you while taking baby into consideration"
bxzaow,"YTA. However in this case you may a justified asshole. The non-asshole way, would have been to approach them and give them neighborly advice that their vehicle could be subject to abandonment. Unfortunately, anything done after that could potentially be pinned on you. So if you don't know the type of people they are, then the risk you're willing to take is entirely up to you."
bxzb0k,"NTA but you should really find a new job like TODAY. Strike while the iron is hot, and you can justify your reasoning with them. Show your crazy portfolio of what you've been doing (within legal lines) and you will get such a better job."
bxzbwi,"YTA. I'm never a fan of posing food service or retail jobs as the *worst thing that could ever happen to you.* It's a version of putting others down to make yourself feel better, which is probably why your friend got pissed. You belittled his mom to make yourself feel better.

&#x200B;

Edit: and even if your dad (also an asshole) was the one who said it first, you still repeated it in a way that meant you agreed with his forecast of your future."
bxzflb,Your bf sounds like the real asshole here.
bxzi4w,"NTA, but you could have been more tactful by calling him out privately first."
bxzjgb,"NTA
You threw a baby shower for her and also attempted for several weeks to get in contact and she’s ghosted you. I would absolutely block her on social media at this point. She has moved on and no longer wants your friendship. She is TA because she ignored your attempts at contact."

Massive red flags here. Jealous and controlling.

Move on."
bxzrri,"NAH but borderline immature.  Your partner is in an industry where he can't exactly re-schedule opportunities, certain things will only happen once and he's in the career building stage.  Although your performance is sentimental to you, let's be frank - it's the end of session performance for a summer camp, it's not like you've been invited to perform at the Met or sing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl.  It would be nice if he's there to see you but you might want to grow up a little about the relative importance of things."
bxzt3n,"YTA. Completely the asshole. She didn’t ask for you medical advice or opinion.

bxzut6,"~~<<vote changed>> Tipping is intended to help bridge the income of servers.  If they're making a full minimum wage, then it's less necessary.  I'd say if it's a nice restaurant and they were particularly attentive, then a 5-10% tip to give them MORE than minimum wage might not be inappropriate, but... that's up to you.~~

Based on discovering that as it turns out even when the wait staff are paid ""full"" minimum wage they have to tip out the house, I am going to have to change my vote to YTA."
bxzw0a,"NTA

I think everyone is missing what OP is asking. I am going based off of the situation that OP described in which his GF was offered to smoke laced weed and the other friends don't even know what it is laced with. 

&#x200B;

As a person who smokes themselves I wouldn't want myself or any of my friends smoking laced weed especially not knowing what it is laced with.  If that is what OP is asking us to give him judgement on then I don't see him as an asshole for being concerned about the weed itself.

&#x200B;

If this is about her smoking weed twice a week and you want that to stop I'll change my judgement to you being the asshole."
bxzz3s,NAH. Except maybe the courier who didn’t check the weather report.
by01t5,NTA - The only asshole here is your dad. Both your mom and the other lady sound like smart women.
by034p,NAH. She’s just embarrassed. She’d laugh at you if it happened the other way around. We’re human. We can’t always hold it in.. 😂
by04jq,"YTA it is part of your role as his partner to listen to him. Would you rather he excitedly talk to someone else about his passions? My boyfriend is in computer science and talks to me all the time about scripting languages and code, none of which I understand and find very hard to follow, but I’m just happy to see him so excited about what he’s doing and feel so loved that he wants to share his excitement with me."
by065h,"They decided everything without her. So they shouldn't be surprised when the person and their schedule they didn't consider can't be there. They should have tried to work with her (hmm like a team) rather than tell her what to do and then get pouty when she can't. They fucked up and aren't being flexible. She isn't responsible for ""the household"". How can they be counting on someone they didn't even consider and won't consider."
by07uw,NTA. Runrunrunrunrun away.
by0954,"YTA. Holy hell you are so lucky your stuff wasn't stolen. You deserved him getting pissed at you, and everyone defending you in that moment was perpetuating this really crappy attitude towards someone who did you a really big favor.

&#x200B;

Tbh, if it was me and I had to leave, I would have taken your stuff to the librarian and said that I had been asked to watch it but couldn't anymore. And I would not have cared for a second if you had a panic attack because your stuff was stolen. 

&#x200B;

Oh and your use of quotations with ""urgent bathroom trip"" is so arrogant. Take your stuff with you if you aren't planning on being back within 5 minutes."
by0bgr,NTA people like her are the reason it’s so hard to get the benefits in the first place and why people with benefits get a bad rap
by0bsf,"NAH. It sounds like you were saying it pretty light-heartedly and didn’t mean anything sinister. On her hand she probably actually likes the guy if she’s been talking to him for around a year and you added another insecurity to the, in her eyes, hopeful relationship. So she’s probably overreacting because, well sometimes the truth hurts lol and she has probably thought the same thing and doesn’t like that it’s possible other people are also thinking that “she’s just the rebound.” Just try reiterate you weren’t being serious, and hopefully she gets over it."
by0e0k,NTA. You are better off without him.
by0elp,"NTA - this doesn't sound like much of a ""gift"" so schedule it when it's convenient for you to do all this work."
by0hez,">literally every female

You can call us ""women"", thanks.

NTA between you and the other guy.  The people who ostracized you are assholes.  He may have thought she was single and deserved to know that she was not.  If she didn't want to get caught cheating or have people find out about it, she shouldn't have cheated."
by0ja4,"YTA. you don't get to tell her what she should and should not wear. You don't get to police what she is wearing. HOWEVER, if her actions made you uncomfortable, then you have every single right to express that. Instead of saying ""Wear a bra next time"" you should have spoke up at the time and said ""Your breasts are in my face and that makes me uncomfortable. Would you mind washing in a different manner"", not take her aside and tell her that what she is wearing is inappropriate because of your feelings.

Edit: I've read through the comment and wish to clarify, I don't believe her actions are okay either. She should have kept her boobs out of his face. I'm willing to revise the judgement to ESH because it's still none of his business about her bra, and the question is ""AITA for telling an employee to wear a bra next time"" and the answer is yes, you are. But she should have kept her boobs out of your face. As someone else commented a while back ""you can still be an asshole, even if you were wronged"""

Not everyone communicates in the same way and on the same timeline. He doesn't owe you a quick conversation any more than you owe him unending patience. If you drift apart, c'est la vie with some friendships."

by285a,"ESH. You’re insecure and felt the need to violate the privacy of a stranger. Idek why or what good you thought would come of that. Your bf shouldn’t keep up communications with an ex if it makes you uncomfortable. Your bfs friends are not your friends, so you can’t expect them to be genuine but they still suck.

by2ho6,"YTA- I go to bed at 8 and my kids at 7:30. I’m a person big on respect though...and that includes respecting others. If I thought it would upset a neighbor, I’d plan to do it at a different time. Why would you want to be the cause of dissension and ugliness? Just do it earlier."
by2j5e,"NTA. They are getting a private apartment for the price of a shared one, and you won't be adding any usage to the utility so the utility burden will only be theirs anyway. They are coming out on top, honestly, which is a shame since they clearly are awful roommates and you hate to see bad behaviour rewarded.

ETA: I agree with everyone else, you *need* to contact the landlord. Even if they can't let you out of the lease [though I bet they can, you probably have to pay a fee] you will want to document the current state of the apartment. If they trash it even more once you're gone and your name is still on the lease, you're legally just as responsible as they are. Work it out with your landlord to rid yourself of as much liability as possible."
by2laz,"NAH  


I can understand your father and stepmother's anger that you wouldn't attend a memorial for your brother, clearly organized by people who cared about him. However, it sounds like you did the right thing for you. If you would have only been angry and outraged, then it wasn't a healthy environment for you or a healthy addition to other mourners.   


But honestly, I think you need to attend some kind of therapy or Nar-Anon meeting to work through these feelings. Once you work those, you can truly help create some kind of meaning and tangible change from your brother's untimely death"
by2nrx,"NTA.  Put up signs, and build a fence.  I know it sucks, but a fence is the only thing that will work.  People know they shouldn’t be on your property.  They do it anyway because it’s convenient for them.  The signs are to protect you from liability while your fence is built.  Start by having an assessor mark your property lines.

ETA: motion activated sprinklers may also help."
by2quo,"NTA. There’s no rules—and there shouldn’t be, against masturbating to porn while in a relationship lol. I wish my BF would masturbate instead of nudge me while I’m busy. But in all seriousness, watching porn is normal and comparing it to cheating is absolute crap."
