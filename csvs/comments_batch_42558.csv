c3ryc9,NTA. She sounds proper /r/raisedbynarcissists material
c3s1nu,"NTA

Both are bad but one is obviously worse. But I’d not take the one that feels more innocent lightly. You can confront him with it if he says something again or decide to report if it keeps going. I think the reason you’re afraid it’s hypocritical is because you’re thinking a bit too black and white. Of course homophobic remarks are never good, but there’s still a difference to make in intent, toxicity and severity."
c3s6kw,"YTA - This was not the way to explain adoption.

As an adopted person I get tired of hearing these stories.

Also her the 7y/o reasoning of I have baby pictures is moot, I have baby pictures, but she's 7 I'll give her that ;)"
c3s9id,"NTA, the ceremony is your celebration of your achievements. You should be called whatever name you want to be called. Your mom's being silly about it. Maybe she feels put off that you don't like to use the name she gave you?"
c3sbo9,"YTA- you made her life difficult enough. Leave her alone. This whole mission is really creepy and selfish. It’s for YOUR benefit, not hers. Get therapy if that’s what it takes to cope with your guilt, but don’t try to find her."
c3sfl0,"NTA: He uses your money to pay for half of it, so he shouldn’t have taken it away in the first place because it’s partly your’s. He is acting childish."
c3si2v,YTA as a fellow vegetarian it seems like you are making a big deal over a relatively small thing. You might be upset if you learned how much your veg food is in contact with cooking utensils and grills that have touched meat and eggs.
c3smht,"NTA, kinda hard to judge fully though since in the US it would be considered perfectly normal to live on your own at your age.  Not contacting them for so long seems a bit extreme, but there's obviously a lot going on here that I'm just not going to understand."
c3sofk,YTA if you don't understand why perhaps you also need to be tested for Aspergers.
c3sp5j,"First, why hasn’t your fiancé given you the spot already? 

Second, nothing wrong with asking about fitting two cars in if it doesn’t impede anybody else’s experience."
c3sr49,"YTA, if you don’t tell him. He’s already “suffering” if he’s got a cheating girlfriend. As a friend, it’s your duty to tell him. 

And honestly if you don’t and he finds out, it’s going to blow up in your face."
c3svaz,"NTA if you tell her. You would actually be an asshole if you do *not* say anything. She deserves to know, and your best friend is an absolute asshole."
c3svda,"YTA. She’s your wife.. what do you mean it has nothing to do with her? You are sad, she wants to be there to support you, asshole."
c3svy6,NtA - no one looks out for your career better than yourself
c3svyw,NTA. MIL obviously has no business adulting and should not be dragging you guys into her mess. You should have never even let her move in.
c3sx03,"YTA. Your reasons for wanting to try for another kid are sexist (you make it sound like anyone but a straight male can’t like sports etc), and absolutely send the message to your other children that they are not enough for you.

ETA:

>I don’t think she understands how special it is for a father to have a son who follows in his footsteps

Again - your existing son can’t? Your daughter can’t? I’m calling bullshit. Unless your desire to put your dick in a vagina is your literal only legacy, your kids can follow in your footsteps. Are you creative? Entrepreneurial? Athletic? Curious? Altruistic? There’s more than liking women that you can pass on."
c3t0b4,"YTA - you told him not to take it to heart, but then mention here you were honest and brutal. Typically, when you’re honest, you want the recipient of your honesty to take it to heart. 

Bottom line: there was no reason to write and send the thing."
c3t2cf,This is better suited for r/relationships
c3t4bn,"NAH

He and his group are running the game a certain way and you're free to decline if it's not something you're interested in. 

Personally I agree though and I probably wouldn't join a game where you just get handed a premade with no input."
c3t8er,NTA but (as a joke only) you would be the A* only if you don’t come back and give us an update!
c3tbgf,"NTA. You're doing all the right things, they should be encouraging you, not criticizing you. 12 lbs isn't even that much, for Pete's sake.

>'she can’t control her mouth to comment on things her eyes see’.

Tell her she'd better figure out how before it catches knuckles. That's bullshit."
c3tbs2,NTA: trust takes time. Maybe in time it will come but it takes a long time to repair those kinds of wounds.
c3te39,NTA.  Three hours before is not an appropriate amount of time to request a color scheme.
c3tfeh,"YWBTA, his house, his rules."
c3tiir,"NAH

Set expectations and boundaries now.  I don't think your mom's an A, but she's being unreasonable.  Cut those strings and spread those wings. Get her used to not having instant access to you. She raised a self sufficient adult,  and now should respect reasonable space."
c3tj2d,"NTA

>For my own sanity I go 

When I encounter someone half drunk, ...    
I leave the premises immediately."
c3tjv1,NTA You can't afford it. Its as simple as that
c3tlk8,"NTA at all. Go anyways

Also, don't format a post like that"
c3tncr,NTA for being concerned but YTA for grabbing the wheel without warning. I would’ve been pissed at you too. You’re lucky you didn’t cause an accident. Instead point out his error and let him correct himself.
c3tqil,"The fact that you threw out her old clothes tips this into YTA territory - how would you feel if someone threw out your things and replaced them with something *they* liked better, but you didn't? 

It can be hard to deal with a partner's insecurity, and it's nice that you want to help, but unfortunately it's not that easy. You can't **make** her happy with herself again, only she can do that. Your job is to stand on the sidelines repeating ""You're beautiful. You're witty. You're smart."""
c3tshw,"NTA (although I contemplated ESH because of the way you handled it with your husband). Many little boys with older sisters end up with fingers, toes and faces painted (sometimes by choice and sometimes not!) - your husband seems duly threatened by the idea that it could be gender confusing for your son. 

I’m a bit perturbed by his comment about women only wearing nail polish to look more attractive. Don’t lose sight of this misogyny as part of the bigger picture of a disagreement on how to parent."
c3tsm2,"NAH, but I'm not sure this is the best way to go about this. It's really easy to set up social media profiles under someone's nose, which subjects them to the same issues while making them feel like they have to hide it from you. Might be better to allow them to have social media with strict rules about you being able to monitor them, have their passwords, etc."
c3tw3v,NTA. Do you have another safe place to go? This doesn’t sound like a good environment.
c3tx5c,"NAH. You should totally let them know about the problems you've been having with their schedule. They won't be angry at all, in fact they'd probably be absolutely mortified to think that you've heard them."
c3u0su,"NTA. I relate to this so hard. You're already in too deep if you're lying to them; time to set some boundaries. 

You should quickly instate some rules like ""everyone throws down on gas or no ride."" Or ""if you bring a passenger, you cover gas money for them"" and ""no rides anywhere I wouldn't otherwise go"" etc.

People will usually take advantage of free things, but most people don't *expect* things for free. Owning/operating a car isn't free, most people respect that fact. Your friends who complain about no free rides are not very good friends (unless they're providing you with a similar free service, for which your rides are compensation)."
c3u1ds,"NTA as long as you say something to them directly and not a higher up. Simply say it bothers your kid (and/or you, if you want to add) and ask if they could smoke out of a window or a different area outside."
c3u1k1,"YTA 

Hold out.

*Coming from another divorced person sticking it out in a state for the kids.*"
c3u5xi,NTA - she’s very rude or very clueless or both
c3ucmb,NAH. Being engaged doesn't mean you have to out yourself to your coworkers. Do what feels right to you.
c3ud46,YTA  - You are encouraging a 14 year old girl to have sex.  You say you aren’t but you gave her condoms and told her she doesn’t have to wait until marriage.  On top of that she’s not your family.  You are in no position to have a talk like this with her.
c3uie3,"I would say NTA.

 You were helping your mom, your brother wasn't doing anything and your mom took his side.

INFO: How old are you and your brother?"
c3uipr,"YTA. 

People do this because there is such a huge difference month to month developmentally at that age. It is annoying to me that people act so ridiculous about this. Why do you care? It isnt really necessary to me to use months after two years but at the same time like why actually be a jerk about it when you could just... Be normal and like... Get over yourself? Maybe?"
c3ukwh,NTA - Dude is a creep and got what he deserved.
c3umuz,"YTA:

>So I say, ""That is a dog. This is a food court. Your dog is in it.""

That's really condescending considering the fact that you don't even work in that mall. Plus, if the mall is explicitly ""dog friendly"" then is this even a problem? If no one in the mall (workers, security guards, etc.) has said anything about these dogs then I'd assume they're allowed there."
c3uoj6,"NTA, but this situation doesn’t call for that. It calls for not devoting any more time or attention to this friend. They don’t care about you, and you getting angry and ‘calling them out’ isn’t going to make anything better."
c3ur9i,"NTA, he’s an asshole for sure. You needed his help with cleaning the cat. He’s just irritable that he was woken, people have strong emotions when they’re woken sometimes."
c3usc1,NAH. Maybe offer to do something nice for your sister/the family to soften the blow.
c3uw89,"ESH, they’re TA for questioning you about the memorial, but you’re TA for thinking they’d magically know that your nephew was graduating this year. Yes, graduations happen every year, but people still have to be invited in advance?"
c3uwq7,"NTA, that sucks that she’s irritated, but now you get your break. It’s not like you’d even get a commission by taking the walk in, so this seems perfectly reasonable."
c3uy7r,"YTA - Afraid so. You DO NOT leave your girl alone in a city, after a rave, where the two of you have been attending as a couple. Or just, in general, really. 

I mean why wouldn't you just get the taxi back with her? What if she got hurt or attacked on the way there or back again while going for her jacket? And then she still had to get back home by herself, upset and fucking *pissed* at you.

It's very bad form and I think you will have to do a LOT of grovelling and genuine making up to do, for quite a while.

EDIT: Also, the money will be irrelevant in years to come. But I bet she'll never forget this."
c3uybj,"NTA. 

>No one is getting a plus one unless they are engaged to their partner or living together 

This is pretty standard for wedding invitations. You're also not required to invite someone who talks shit about you, so."
c3v3lq,"NAH.  I'd just suggest that picking out a gift usually involves thinking about what *they* would like, not so much your own interests.  But nothing wrong with giving a plant if you think they will appreciate it."
c3v5cb,"NAH, although I'm really curious what ""a good amount of experience with this kind of situation"" amounts to."
c3v6ul,"YTA. As a friend you should've at least ask if someone was picking her up or not. Maybe she didn't ask because she didn't wanted to bother you. It's called a walking boot so she can move the less possible during recovery, it's not a magical boot for running a marathon. You should take care a bit more of your friends."
c3vaq6,"NAH. You definitely suck for doing it, but you seem legitimately sorry and you offered to help them out any way you could. Obviously they aren't the assholes, but I don't think you are either. You just made a mistake.

If it happens again, though, then YTA."
c3vbbs,"NTA They're adults, they can talk with each other. It's not your job to be the messenger, especially when they don't know that you aren't supposed to shoot the messenger."
c3vets,[removed]
c3vifd,[deleted]
c3viou,"YWBTA. You can’t force someone to go to college, and the idea that college is necessary to find a good job is a little insane. There are trade schools and training programs that don’t require college degrees but prepare people for jobs. And some people can get good jobs without any of that. 

College isn’t for everyone, and if you demand she goes when she doesn’t want to, you’re asking her to change for you. That’s not fair."
c3vkcw,[deleted]
c3vpkz,"NTA - you didn’t snoop, you saw it on social media and she agreed beforehand not to go to them, and betrayed your trust."
c3vqxz,"NTA and your boyfriend's a fuckhead, dump him. It's one thing to say ""Hey, wouldn't your brother be willing to babysit a bit and we can spend more time together?"" but another to accuse you of not having your shit together and being so antagonistic?"
c3vsnn,"NTA morally, but, who's name is on the title/bill of sale on the car? That's going to determine who gets the money from the sale."
c3vtm7,"YTA. I get having another sibling in the house might stifle your only child party; but this kid who probably can't even tie his shoes yet just lost his mom, and you want to gatekeep him from having what seems like some kind of semi normal life so that you'll be unhindered by it all. 

Alot of the time doing the right thing is hard, but it's usually what counts the most in peoples lives."
c3vv40,NTA Do NOT resign (or indicate that you're resigning) before the offer is in hand.  Lots of shit can happen between the verbal and the written.  It's happened before.
c3vygx,"YTA - definitively. You're making a medical judgment AND an ethical judgment that is not yours to make, potentially costing someone else their livelihood."
c3vymo,"NTA

Make another burger. Sit right in front of him. Eat it slowly. Maintain eye contact."
c3w1v3,"NTA, this chick sounds nuts. Stop engaging with her about this topic."
c3w3gu,NTA.  Tell her to just close her window.
c3w4po,"YTA. She thought she was saving you from embarrassment by other people seeing you still had a tag on, it probably never even crossed her mind you would be trying to return it. I wouldn’t have paid for it either if i was her, and would be quite offended by saying that I should. Honestly this made a worse impression than just flat out not showing up."
c3w6ri,"NTA

It's a sanitary thing. The high heat kills any remaining bacteria. So it would also kill it for the pot too. If you didn't sanitize after use you would hands down get a UTI and/or yeast infection next time you used the thing, he clearly doesn't get how bacteria or vaginal health works if he's calling you ridiculous for sanitizing it in the first place. 

Your boyfriend is being childish and a bit sexist tbh. Tell him to grow the fuck up.  It's perfectly sanitary and he hasnt had ""food contaminated by period blood"" (does he think it works like cooties?).

Your period comes out your vagina, you don't put boiling water in there. Is his dick contaminated with your period blood? Better have him go scrub that shit.

Edit: Tell him no more blowjobs. His penis goes in your vagina, and since you can't properly sterilize your vagina after your periods or his penis after sex that you can't risk the period blood poisoning from oral sex. Maybe he'll see how ridiculous he's being."
c3wb3b,"NTA, but are you Ross Geller?"

c3wgbn,"Not that you would be an asshole, but technically it's not illegal to use the accessible stall. It's rude af, but I don't think you would have much luck if you tried to report him.

You're probably better off to just mention it to him next time he does it. In general I think it's better to try and deal with these little issues yourself before moving it up the chain of command."
c3whlu,"NAH. However, I would say YTA if you ghost her with no explanation.  I would be honest with her and tell her how you feel. You're her best friend, you should be able to explain your concerns to her, not us."
c3wiuw,NTA You specifically told her that you didn’t like the genre.
c3wsao,NTA - If you don’t want to stay in a camper she should respect that. You shouldn’t have to justify why you don’t want to.
c3wuy8,YTA for thinking they need to respect you like an elder when youre not their elder. You sound like a dumb kid who's trying to grab at a power trip that doesnt exist.
c3wxh0,NTA. It's your free time and you can spend it how you like.
c3wya6,"NTA. Congrats on your divorce. Sounds like you dodged a huge bullet

You dont ""obtain"" people. You ""obtain"" objects. Your ex sounds like a predatory sex tourist or one of those creeps who orders a mail order bride."
c3x00c,"NAH. Just say you'd like the company and don't pressure her if she doesn't want to go, and you're fine."
c3x15b,"YTA, obviously. You knew your husband didn't really want you to do that, you were just waiting for the excuse.

And when your husband asks you to cheer him up the first thing you think to do is tell him that a bunch of guys are hitting on you?"
c3x1k1,"NAH - it sounds like a genuine accident. But sometimes you have to take responsibility in an accident and since you were the one passing, this is technically your fault. 

Also, you’re old enough and it seems riding fast enough to get off the sidewalks. Bikes should be in the streets following the same rules as cars unless you are a small child."
c3x5gu,"NTA. new mom here too of a 3 month old. Was in a group chat with other moms who just had babies all close together. They are the types of mom that blame the child. “She’s annoying. All she wants to do is hang on to me and she cries...” this was in reference to a 4 week old. This lady has two other kids. Shes done this before. Anyways, they started to speak super negative about their kids and being a FTM, I was a sponge and soaked everything up. Started to think ans talk like them and HATED it. My baby is not manipulative. She is not annoying or ruining my life...

I stopped talking to them everyday. Once every couple of weeks MAYBE. Since then, no joke baby and I have bonded so much better and being positive (for me) gets me thru the rough growth spurts and whatnot. Surrounding yourself with awful and negative people can make an impact. Especially if your sister wants friends."
c3x8j0,"NTA. Why are your parents mad at you because they took away your medication, and now you can't sleep are more depressed? It simply doesn't make sense."
c3x980,"NTA. It's a funny way to give him the gift. Stuff it with tissue paper to make it seem full, and PLEASE be safe. Most knives come are sold in boxes. Leave it in there."
c3xbfi,NTA and you might have spared yourself & your kids the only nasty grandparent soap opera drama there...
c3xbqy,"YTA. Calm down. Not everyone is you, your expectations are not realistic."
c3xc1j,"NTA, but I would probably give him a basic “hey I’m not doing this anymore since you can’t respect boundaries.” message and then block him!"
c3xeze,NTA - everyone picks up fruit to check it before buying! Everyone! You did nothing wrong.
c3xgaq,"Oh, honey, I hate to say this because I totally understand where you're coming from and I'm sorry for your loss, but YTA. He's a grown ass man. He can go and do what he wants within the limits of the law. 

Instead of babysitting like a hawk, sit him down and tell him how you feel. Set up, in advance, structured time together, so you have something to look forward to. Understand that as much as you are grieving, he is grieving in his own way too."
c3xizg,"YTA. they asked you to design their program and you do this? Plus of course your wife would be upset, this is her parents."

c3xyw3,"NTA. 2 weeks is a long time to have someone in your house anyways. Also she wasn't the most polite about it either 💁

Your house, your rules."
c3y01h,"ESH. Your driver shouldn't be sending you messages harassing you about tips. As a former delivery driver, I understand it can be frustrating to feel like you're not being compensated for your hard work. That's no excuse to take it into your own hands and be rude to customers, though. 

On the other hand, you shouldn't be ordering food delivery if you're really hurting for money that badly. Especially not delivery that is 40 minutes from your house when you know you're only tipping a minuscule amount. Walk yourself to the grocery store or ask your wealthy aunt to drive you so that you can spend the exact amount of money you'd spend on one greasy meal on some actual food to last you the days you're home alone. Although I kind of find it hard to believe that your aunt is wealthy and doesn't have food in her home that you can eat."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
c3y23q,NTA - your husband sounds selfish and controlling.  You are contributing to the family by looking after children and looking after the home and deserve an equal say in family finances.  The idea that you get no say because you don’t go out to work is Neanderthal nonsense.
c3y34v,"You're a 17 year old so let it be an experience, what you did is classic asshole. YTA because if you were the one that parked in the wrong spot, got towed and had to call your mom while your friend was only worried for not making dinner... you'd be pissed out of your mind that your friend ditched you."
c3y481,"NTA but take care that she isn’t being maipulated by your aunt.  The aunt could be saying “i do so much for you and i aren’t invited poor me” and guilt tripping grandma.

The only other way around it is to sus out aunts routine and see her when aunt is out."
c3y6d3,"YTA - clearly. Cheating and blackmail are on completely different levels. No fault in wanting to spill all her secrets, but to extort her for your silence is ridiculous, not to mention illegal. Find a respectable way to pay your bills and let go of the whole mess."
c3y7jl,"NTA, but I think you should unfollow him, without unfriending/unadd if you want to keep him on FB. 
Depends also on the aftermath, if sending him a message will destroy your efforts on getting back on good terms with you family, maybe you should just avoid it and let things go. 

You can also anonymously report him if he says hateful things or spam. If it's not the case, he has the right to express himself/saying his opinion, like it or not."
c3y9xp,NAH. You have to live your life or you'll resent them if you don't already. Get with your other siblings and see if you all can arrange for a nurse or someone to help take care of them. See if members of the congregation can help as well.
c3yc5u,"NTA

>she is upset because I ""disrespected my elder in public."" AITA

No one deserves respect just because they're old."
c3yck0,"NTA.

If she's slandering you, and claiming that you were abusive (presumably her claim as to why the marriage ended, and not her leaving you for the man she had an affair with) then you are absolutely within your bounds to correct her. 

It's understandable that she doesn't want her mental health issues to become public knowledge, but she brought it upon herself when she started making baseless accusations against you."
c3yerc,[removed]
c3yfcz,"NTA.  They were already told but did it anyway.  If hey wanted to talk, they could have just left to not ruin it for everyone else."
c3yin9,YTA. It’s not hurting you.
c3yj6e,NTA. Your mom needs to parent your brother. Throwing a ball isn’t a coping mechanism.
c3yk9f,"NTA

Not your responsibility to help this random ass woman in your life lose weight. Especially when she has no desire to help herself. You've answered this same line of questions and she didn't listen. She wants to dream and act like she's going to change herself. But is scared shitless of doing it.

Not your job fo enable her daydreaming."
c3ykcp,"NTA follow your own life journey OP. Your mother had that expectation for you because that is all she knew and was told her whole life that was the way things were supposed to be.

She is in your heart, if you follow your heart you can not go wrong."
c3ykg6,"YTA. 

Guitar at a party is such a douche move. Yeah, small talk is awkward but that’s part of the deal with parties."

c3yqss,"NTA. 

You live with your decisions, and that's something they should learn. It wasn't something harmless either, they didn't steal a candy bar.

They assaulted you, multiple times, and now they're getting their asses handed to them. Actions have consequences, some more serious than others. This is one of the more serious ones. 

You don't just get to walk around being violent and not pay a price, doesn't matter how old you are. It's something we all have to learn. And they're old enough by now to understand that, or old enough to find out what those consequences are if they don't understand it.

In the end its up to you but definitely NTA in my opinion."
c3ywar,"NTA. Who plans a wedding in between Christmas and New Year’s and expects non-family or not super best friends to attend long distance?? Her expectations were off the mark. 

Definitely send a card and maybe a gift, but don’t feel bad for going on your already planned vacation. And don’t let her guilt trip you over it. The world doesn’t revolve around a couple’s wedding, people have lives. If someone’s attendance is *that* critical, you make sure you float dates by them before booking anything. 

Also, I’m a little confused about the engagement thing. Are you guys long distance or is the wedding just going to be a destination wedding?"
c3yysv,"NTA. She sounds narcissistic, and, honestly, having a baby shower for your second kid is kinda tacky anyway. Your family in general sounds pretty sucky TBH."
c3z04w,"If you took Joe's ticket and gave it to someone else without at least talking to him first, YTA. If you were concerned that he would back out of the deal and leave you without a ride, you should have told him that and allowed him a chance to explain."
c3z2ym,NTA.  J didn't want to lose the friendship yet he went ahead and flirted with L?  Guy seems like to want the attention and then disappear.  He disrespected your sister by doing this.
c3z47c,"ESH - if you’d paid as much as you were willing, you didn’t have to agree to Venmo him back. For that matter, you didn’t have to pay for his party in the first place. He did give you a terrible present, but your present to him was your decision. 

I’m also a little confused, you seemed willing to put in more money to the excursion, then got upset when he gave you a different way to pay. Did you not expect him to have money?"
c3zc0q,"Definitely NTA.

c4079v,"NAH If I were you I'd just say that I cant afford to go (which is true) and then if she wanted to pay for you to come, it'd be up to her. 


But I think acting all excited then later mentioning that she has to pay for you to go because you cant afford it is a dick move."
c407ve,"NTA

The entire point of doing this is to guilt you into handing over cash for a service he has already done. By preventing him from doing it, you threw off his groove. It's definitely something that tends to catch tourists more than people that live in big cities. 

Source: I live in Chicago."
c409so,"NTA

But you cannot really blame her for her frustration either.

FWB means Friend with benefits.

You lost the benefits because she is pursuing exclusivity with her new love interest. She assumed she would still have you as a friend, but clearly hearing about her new love life makes you uneasy and thats fair. This guy may become a big part of her life and it might be best for the both of you that you get out of the way.

Friendships are best when both parties are able to speak freely about everything going on in their life. If she feels she has to censor herself around you to protect your feelings the friendship becomes more stressful and therefore less enjoyable.

Let her cut you off."
c40a1x,"NTA at all. You don't need to change your feelings because your mother suddenly has for some reason, it's an unfair expectation on you. Doesn't sound like he has been a dad to you at all so why would you want to call him that?"
c40ayb,"NTA I think you might want to wait to see his reaction after you pop the question. If he goes on again about how he doesn’t think she is good for you then maybe consider making your friend best man. Make him a groomsman. 

But if he flips and says he is happy for you then see how you feel."
c40erh,"NTA: you're 19. I could understand leaving her a note maybe or calling her if you're gone for a while but to get that upset over it is really weird.  You are an adult with your own life. Even if you live with her, she shouldn't need to know where you are at every second of the day."
c40kwq,"YTA

Not because of your mindset - you are making sure the needs of the business and customers are met. This is good.

However the golden rule of floor management in general is 
""Praise is public , discipline in private.""

Your job as a manager is to promote productivity and coach your staff. This isn't coaching, its bullying."
c40lx1,"NTA

You have no way of knowing if it was intentional or not. Do what you want, but I hope it involves sharing some with your gay sister just because that would be nice."
c40pmo,"NTA

Even if you didn't intend to give it back, you don't owe your brother a free ride. $300 is cheap."
c40uyc,YTA. Had the same situation. She doesn’t want him there and you admit he’s there often. Doesn’t matter that he “stays in the room the whole time”. She didn’t sign up to live with him. Why can’t you go to his house?
c40vmb,"NTA: even if it's Friday or Saturday night, some decorum needs to be kept."
c41628,"NTA. You and your wife (and for that matter the aunt) probably should have gotten on the same page about this earlier, as it seems predictable this would come up. But at your children's ages, I'm pretty surprised your wife wants to hide it from them, and I think that's a mistake. They're mature enough to grapple with this, and even if they're not they're all at or quickly approaching dating age and should be aware of domestic/relationship violence.

(Edited because I changed my mind from no assholes here after further reflection on the kids' ages.)"
c41gz1,"INFO: does the invite normally mean they pay for you? Or are you happy to pay for yourself?

If you're expecting to be invited on a paid-for holiday then YTA but if you mean you just want to join them and pay for yourself, NTA."

c41m3h,"NTA

Unfortunately, there are a lot of people like this on Discord and they sap all the life out of those who try to be their friend or help. You can try and be there for them and help them but many won’t change no matter what you do or say to help. Eventually, it’s going to take a toll on you and it seems like it did.

The best thing to do in these situations, which you seem to have done, it just stop talking with them. You need to put your own mental health first. If talking to them has become a serious burden, it’s best to cut them out. Besides, it’s just Discord. 

Been there myself and know many others who have too. I think you’ve done the right thing."
c41mlp,"Wait, it's only been six months? Dude, walk away. You're NTA for walking away. Do it, and do it fast.

>I still think she's the most amazing and strong person I've met 

Well no, she is neither of these things. From what you've described, she's actually quite selfish. So stop with all this worshipping of her. And don't even *think* about marrying her (you mentioned divorce), because unless she comes clean 100% about the reasons for her current behaviour, she is untrustworthy.

What you need to figure out, is what it is that makes you put up with this sort of treatment. So you need to do some introspection and reflecting."
c41tc4,"Don't go ""defending"" your sister when she's explicitly asked you not to. Your mom's behaviour is toxic af, but that's not the way to deal with it. Tell your sister that she deserves to be treated better, and that you'll support her if and when she wants you to. Also, tear a strip off your mom for stealing *your* chocolate."
c41w31,NTA. Every musician should be able (and humble enough) to play even the most Simple songs. And playing by ear is a great exercise.
c41y2n,"NTA - the kid was covered in mud, so you washed her. That seems pretty sensible to me. However, since your brother and SIL have now said they’re not okay with that, you need to respect that going forward (even if you disagree). You’d be TA if you did it again after her parents have expressed they don’t want you to. I’d be tempted to let them make mud pies again next time she comes to visit, and see what her parents say when they have to take her home covered in mud..."
c4244n,"NTA. Is he Homer Simpson? What he needs to do is not much in the scheme of parenting tasks, and I don't understand why he needs help to be a parent through one thing"
c42amf,"YTA - guy number one seems to reciprocate your feelings and if you told him all about the other date and he’s cool with it then that’s no problem. 

The problem is guy number two, you need to have the same conversation with him BEFORE you go back out with number one. If it’s a dealbreaker for him then that’s cool too, at least you’ve been up-front and everyone knows where they stand. 

You would be the asshole if you just went and did it while guy number two has no idea. He could think he’s heading into a potential long-term relationship when actually the girl he’s dating is banging someone else."
c42ckm,"NAH she wants to see her baby graduate but expecting you to walk for nothing is ridiculous as is the multiple day affair. Pic the day for your diploma and walk then.  

On a side note, you need to find a way to deal with your anxiety. When it starts impacting your life like that, you have reached a real problem. Good luck!"
c42ld0,NTA - If you don't want to eat their food you don't have to. But you should be paying for your own food if that's what you're eating not letting them pay for it.
c42q6c,"NTA. She's not the A for expecting you to contribute given that you're earning money, but she should have communicated this and agreed on an amount from the beginning."
c42qo3,"NTA. She is repeatedly attacking who you are as a person, and even when you disclosed that to her she continued. Honestly I feel like your partner should be taking a MUCH harder stance on this. He should be telling her that if she can’t be a civil person to his PARTNER... she won’t be involved in EITHER of your lives."
c42sn5,NTA how are you the asshole for not paying attention in conversations you arenr even be a part of
c42tmn,"YTA - While I understand not liking someone, even hating them, that's not the reason you're the Asshole. You're an asshole because you, seemingly, are unwilling of even trying to get along with her, and are instead building a growing hatred for the women. Instead of internalizing many of these emotions talk to her about it, perhaps with your father as well so everyone understands. While you are not required to like her, you should at least accept her for your father's sake."
c42zem,YTA. It's not your place to do that.
c43bom,"NTA - this is about your relationship not anyone else’s and if you are, understandably, uncomfortable about starting it off by essentially lying to each other by having a religious ceremony that neither of you believe in that’s your prerogative. Her parents are being unreasonable."
c43e1e,"ESH.  You, for not realizing that Ben cannot be a boyfriend in the way that you need & want until he gets treatment, at least.  He may have other reasons, like being a 100% all-natural asshole, but you won’t know for sure until his bi-polar disorder is treated.  

Ben - even though he’s allowed to decide whether he gets treatment, he’s TA for engaging with you only when he’s in one mode and basically toying with you."
c43hzy,"NTA, if he grabs people's phone and fakes ratings then he deserves to be written up, or even fired."
c43lqk,"NAH. You’re not asking to be spiteful, you’re genuinely curious and it seems like you know how to handle the topic sensitively. However, if she clams up, she’s totally within her right to keep the topic private."

c441wf,"Film industry professional here.

c445so,"NTA. I don't understand why this is even a question. If you have money to pay for your own accommodation, do it."
c4484n,YTA. You're allowed to like things. She's allowed to dislike things. Act like an adult.
c44qnb,"YTA, you set him up deliberately to try and ""prove him wrong"" about whatever. Do you know how shitty that feels? This is nothing to do with being vegan and everything to do with being a self- righteous ass."
c44sgv,"NTA - old age is not an excuse to be rude to people, nor is “being concerned” about your skin health. That said, it is possible that you were slightly overzealous in the way you communicated your displeasure to her. Would recommend clearing the air with an explanation of why you got so upset and asking them for forgiveness in exchange for backing off on your face in the future."
c4508x,"NTA. Why did you decide to sign a lease with someone as awful as Jessica?

Edit: oh yeah okay she’s your best friend, but if you already had a bad experience living with her... then I don’t understand why you’d put yourself through that again. In any case you have every right to bring a guest if you give them enough warning and if your lease allows for it. You’re paying money to live there as much as Jessica is and you have rights over the place as well. Also, it feels like as a roommate you’re being too lenient. If she’s bringing a pet without asking, call her out in it and don’t just be upset by yourself in your room. Make it known you don’t like the arrangement and stand your ground so she’ll know you’re not a pushover."
c4508y,"YTA, a little bit. Not for feeling apathetic, but for expressing little sympathy for your young sister who is dealing with some intense emotion. If the car's not there for you to drive her, you can't very well drive her but you didn't have to say ""it's not such a huge deal"" when it clearly is a huge deal for her."
c459mc,"ESH lol what? Dude, you brought it up, you dangled it in front of her like a piece of meat. I understand the privacy wants, but it sounds like your mom genuinely wants to be a part of your life. Yes, she took it to the extreme, but you did too, by acting silly, and giving her a childish reply, with intentional digging saying the dad part."
c45dlm,"NTA, your sister is for putting you in a position where refusing makes you look bad. If she was so concerned for your aunt, she could have driven considering she’s also older than you and has more years of experience"
c45ela,"Nta 🤷🏻‍♀️ Clearly, she didn't understand it bothers you when you told her, so maybe now she'll get it"
c45ft4,"NTA. So he doesn't have the courage to tell A and C that they're not invited but doesn't mind telling you, his supposedly best friend that you aren't? Unless he says something along the lines of ""yeah I'm sorry dude, we'll do something else together, my bad"", it does seem like an assholish move."
c45h7i,"NTA hes 14. I doubt he can emotionally handle a failing test grade, let alone heartbreak or a kid."
c45hgx,"NTA for being annoyed by this. 

Why don’t you go talk to your boss or supervisor or HR or someone? Explain that it’s clear some people aren’t adequately trained and you’re doing other people’s jobs."
c45jrf,"NTA- generally barbers don’t cut *women style* cuts, but, you’re not asking for that. Shit, I go to women geared hair salons for hair cuts and I’m a male. I’ve never had issues. Is it possible this is just a case of misunderstanding? Were you able to express what you wanted?"
c45lw1,NAH- you didn't know he had a stroke until you were told that he had one.

EDITED to remove judgement; I was wrong"
c45o9i,"NTA.

When he ends up in jail, he'll realise you're not an asshole, too."
c45x4l,YTA. Daisy dukes and a hoodie are not “casual”in terms of wedding attire.  Casual would have been nice slacks and a pretty top or jacket. Your attire was more like Saturday night at the stock car races. I would have been upset with you too and the family members in tee shirts and ball caps were similarly underdressed.
c460ol,"ESH - she’s obviously frustrated and took it out on her mum, but I can totally understand why she might get tired of hearing that she’s going to get prayers for her hard time. I think you could’ve been kinder towards her"
c4629j,"I’m going to say NTA because my neighbour’s puppy was taken to a friend’s house, and turns out the puppy picked up an illness from leftover dog shit in the person’s yard. It was an incredibly expensive lesson to learn and the puppy got really, really sick."
c46amn,"NTA Your boyfriend sounds kinda controlling honestly. You have gone to his family events multiple times and always try to be there for him - he does not get to control your entire life’s plans nor does he get to gaslight you into thinking that you don’t support him enough. From everything you’ve said in your post, you do support him and he’s in the wrong."
c46ekr,"NAH, except your step-dad. You have every right to voice your feelings to your mom. It sucks she got upset, but that's not your fault. I'm sure part of why she was upset is because you are upset.

He just sounds like a jerk. I'm sure he's got some redeeming qualities, but it sounds like he's just unwilling to try and have a civil relationship with you.

Try and talk it out with your mom more. Accept that she's going to be upset. It's kind of a given. If you really can't with your step-dad, is living with your father an option you'd be willing to entertain? You could still hang out with your mom, you just wouldn't live with her. There may even be more opportunity to hang out with her without your step-dad around."
c46f2q,"NTA. Tell them how you feel. Even if you didn't feel this strongly about your dogs, making jokes about harming animals or hoping they die isn't really the pinnacle of humour."

I predict Jim is going to eventually lose favor with this group and get pushed out himself."
c46z7a,"ESH. She shouldn’t be forcing her religion on to you. But even as a fellow queer who has been hurt by religion, I still acknowledge that not all religious institutions are that way.

c47s85,"YTA. It sounds like your feelings were not properly communicated to your sister in advance. Had you previously spoken to your sister or any family member about your animosity towards the Catholic Church and explicitly prohibited this? If not, how can you fault them for it?

None of what you described appears to have been in bad faith or maliciously motivated by your sister who you admit loves you and your kids. Your response was not proportional and I think you owe your sister an apology.

Explain your feelings about the Church to your sister like an adult and try to avoid going apoplectic in the future over a simple misunderstanding."
c47y4f,"NTA. She lied to you, even if it was a small one. She neglected to inform you of what kind of event you were helping with, and she wasn’t even there. That’s fairly shitty. If she does this often and makes no effort to actually hang out with you, it sounds like she’s not a very good friend."
c486vg,"YTA. You know what you did.

Standing someone up on a date is very poor form. It takes a lot of emotional investment to put yourself out there, and getting stood up can be devastating."

c4978l,"NAH.

If she legitimately has a medical reason for not knowing any better or being any better able to modify her actions based on the needs of a situation, then she is NTA.  You chose to keep your feelings to yourself during the event rather than creating a conflict, so you're NTA.  Venting to a friend later is acceptable, and I think that they were trying to get you to see the bigger picture, but calling you TA was not accurate since you kept your feelings to yourself."
c497t6,NTA - trust your gut and don’t engage with this situation any further

c49iut,"NAH (yet) - maybe she really doesn’t know that the number has a fee? I’d bring it up casually next time, telling her you noticed you were being charged and asking her if she knew that was happening/if it was intended. I think sending her a picture of a bill (especially because it’s only a few bucks) would be a bit aggressive off the bat."
c49r1j,"NTA.  I used to work as a restaurant manager.  Once in a while a table would get seated, order and receive beverages, and then for one reason or another get forgotten.  It happens, unfortunately.  Often when it did the customer(s) would just get up and leave without paying.  Never once did we think ""Hey, they just ripped us off!""  

Yes, you technically had drinks, but you ordered them under the pretense that you were going to get food.  Since the restaurant failed to really serve you I don't think you owed them a penny.  Can you imagine them chasing you out to the parking lot and insisting you pay for the drinks after they screwed up and wasted your time so bad?  Me neither."

c4aj9y,"NTA. Been there, it’s not fun pretending to be religious when you aren’t. Why waste your time at this point?

He was not over her and you noted that they are talking about possibly getting together again. That right there is plenty enough of a reason to tell him what she's done. Even if they weren't though, I still feel like you did the right thing. 

Your ex friend also should get a grip. There is no 'choice' for her to tell him at that point. She fucked up and he deserves to know what he may be getting himself back into."
c4dmw8,NTA. You're genuinely concerned for his life. Safety always comes first.
c4dog4,"NTA.

You made sure to tell them you would be unavailable that weekend because of another marriage. Your girlfriend's sister set her dates way before, and your girlfriend is the maid of honour. You have to be there with her, and your friend shouldn't be angry at you 

He shouldn't have set the same dates if he really wanted you there from the 1st place."
c4dolt,"NTA.  Your parents are assholes for giving you a gift and then not letting you have an opportunity to get it.   It's a good thing you live so far away from them, because they are not good people to be around."
c4dq7q,"NTA

Who cares about the circumstances... If you don't wanna hang out with crap people, then you don't have to"
c4dszb,"NAH.  But not having an accident report is like having a big sign that says ""This car's been totalled.  Don't pay too much."""
c4dv7a,NTA. You’re an introvert and that’s okay.
c4dx9t,They want multiple bi weekly game nights and leave you alone to parent? Where’s the concession for you? It’s different having a commitment like this where he’s absolutely not allowed to reschedule or miss it. Makes it hard with small kids. NTA
c4e1j8,"ESH, they for sucking, you for using them. But cutting them off now isn’t being an asshole, so long as you don’t go crawling back to them. That’d make you double asshole."
c4e84s,"Creepy. Creepy. Creepy. You basically started a relationship with him based on a lie: you had mutual friends (you didn’t), and you liked the same things (you found what he liked and then liked them yourself). You manipulated him into a relationship with you. You won’t know if you actually would have hit it off otherwise. 

I would bring this up to him IMMEDIATELY. You don’t want this weighing on you and for him to find out out somehow down the road.

It’s not romantic ... it’s really creepy. Maybe looking him up and finding some info about him is okay. But, adding friends to make it look like you have mutual friends, then pretending to like the same music/movies ... that takes it a step further."
c4eaep,"NAH - I think it’s fair for you to ask if you really want to. However, I’d just take some time to consider whether you really want to, especially if he’s a close friend.

I have a hairdresser in my family who cuts my hair for me. I always offer to pay, but she never accepts it. We do for family. I sometimes tutor for her daughter who’s in school, and we go through the same rigmarole, but no money ever exchanges hands. We help each other out, and me and my fiends have similar arrangements."
c4elnk,NAH. But you are dumb as shit for letting them move in without signing a contract. That *never* ends well. Ever.
c4elvr,"NTA. This guy is a fucking loser. He’s looking at you like you’re a possession, and that your married name is a mark of another guy’s property. That’s disgusting and a huge red flag of unpleasant things to come. Please dump his ass immediately."
c4eqd3,"NTA - while I feel maybe it could’ve been possible to work something out, I think the roommate is out of line here.  Another person moved in and should have to pay rent.  Would it have been different had it been a third guy friend of yours? I bet roommate would have have him to pay rent.  Plus you said that they took over a new room on top of it. Definitely NTA here"
c4erad,"NTA - as far as I’m concerned, if it’s on social media, then it’s public knowledge. Sounds like she probably needs to learn a few lessons for her own safety."
c4eubz,"NTA - he’s an adult, he can do what he pleases as long as he stays focused on his future. Just have a talk with your nephew and let him know that you’re cool with it but he needs to stay on top of his goals."
c4ewxu,NTA. Slobbery toys shouldn’t be anywhere near a salad bar.
c4ex5x,It’s OP’s business if they’re going to be taking a 6+ hour car ride together. Do you want to ride for 6+ hours with someone stanking up the car with BO in the summer?

c4f6rz,"No assholes. But, Why would you publicly thank her for helping buy your house? I think that’s tacky .... and it seems like you maybe want to throw it in your parents face based on how you described the situation."
c4f71g,"This seems super complicated to follow. But, it sounds like Danielle acted insane."
c4fae8,"NTA. I can tell you if this was someone in my D&D group, I'd be real pissed about the way she's ignoring the game. that's disrespectful to everyone else there and disruptive to the game. Basically, it seems like she doesn't want to be there with the distractions she's bringing.  

You can try asking the other members their thoughts privately, but  I do think talking to the DM first to tell them that this bothers you is important. You'll probably find it bothers them as well.  Then, let your DM speak to her about it. Even though they aren't technically in charge, DMs/ GMs do run the game and therefore have a kind of authority there. Don't go in as a whole group and gang up on her though. That'll make her feel really attacked and will probably end badly."
c4fiiw,"NTA, I dont think its unreasonable to be upset here. He crossed the line and it sounds like he's definitely being too friendly towards her here."
c4fqqn,"NTA and this is one of those times when it's clear that Reddit isn't a representative sample of adults. For the love of God, I'm extremely liberal. Most of my friends are also very liberal, and the ones who have kids would absolutely not be ok with polyamorous PDA around their kids. It's confusing, it could cause the parents to have to answer a lot of awkward questions, and there's no reason for the gf to come, because she's not family. She's not even long-term yet.  Props to the rest of your family for being Just-Yes. Let your sister throw a fit and try to call your bluff, and have a great vacation with your non-dramatic relatives."
c4frf2,You should probably go to the wedding instead of the bachelor party
c4g07f,"YTA. That dress is extra as hell, and you’ll definitely draw attention away from the bride and groom. Wear something else."
c4g2rp,"NTA 

In any way, shape, or form. Yes, your mom birthed you/raised you/whatever other thing she wants to use to guilt trip you, I’m sure you’ve heard it all, but that doesn’t mean you owe her anything. If she has a kid old enough to be in college, then she has enough life experience to be okay on her own and needs to not beg you for things. In my opinion (and experience with this) you need to either cut her off completely, or set very very clear boundaries. Stop giving her money."
c4g6po,"NTA - he gifted it to you, do what you want with it. Side note- you’re both in this thing together with the children, he has to pick up his slack. “Not being able to handle them both at once” is a shit excuse, if you can do it, he can too."
c4g8y2,"NTA.  That is the reason contracts exist.  If it wasn't in the contract then you don't need to pay it.  Otherwise they could invent countless other phantom fees under the guise of ""policy."""
c4g9bw,NTA. Your father’s side of the family has treated you like garbage so it makes sense to want to avoid a relationship with them.
c4gbci,"NTA. Your house, your rules. If they’re not following your rules, then you’re well within your right to kick them out."
c4gd8n,NTA. Get away from your abusive family asap.
c4gi7u,"Um... so, you can be mad. Put on a cape and be super mad. But, he didn’t do anything wrong. It’s his vine. You were just the lucky recipient of it while it lasted."
c4giex,"NTA, why are you even friends with that superficial person?"
c4gmhy,YTA sandals are not wedding attire (unless it’s a beach wedding or you’ve been given express permission to wear them). The fact that they specified no shorts was a clear warning to dress to the occasion
c4gn7s,"NTA. Lawyer here, and I would not (read: never) risk my career over the actions of other people when they made it clear they wanted to do drugs in a foreign country.

Additional reasons you're NTA. You didn't say when the party was, but you at least gave her notice in advance (v. not showing up at all).  And, you're not asking for reimbursement."
c4gp8e,"NTA.  One of your duties as a best friend is to protect one another.  That being said, it's good you realize that she may never speak to you again, because that's a real possibility."
c4gssb,"Esh. All I’m hearing in my head, while reading, is plankton screaming, ‘I went to college!’ 

I think your mom may think you are a bit pretentious. 

I don’t know, you, your mom, or really what the issue is. It’s all a bit of a ramble about how she thinks you talk too much and shouldn’t feed stray cats. 

I think you may need to focus a little more on what other people are saying and subtle signs they may not enjoy what you are talking about."
c4gxgy,"NAH, but you need to work on this.

Look, as someone who is an extreme arachnophobe, I totally get just letting your phobia win (as I very much do). But when it starts to seriously affect others, it's time to to something about it.

It's not that your child ""needs"" stickers, it's that she's actually hurting herself to get them. That's really dangerous. 

Maybe you could do something like ""sticker time"" where you go out for a bit and she can play to her heart's content. Get her a sticker book that remains closed and put away while you're in the house. Just don't leave her with bandaids as her only option. It's not fair to her, and it's not healthy for you."
c4h6kw,"Atlanta drivers are insane, you’re automatically NTA just by not succumbing to homicidal road rage."
c4h6pq,YTA oh my god 14 year olds home alone??? So dangerous!! The police will fucking laugh in your face
c4h8s5,NTA and your friend is a weirdo for inviting you to this just because she’s hosting.
c4hady,"YTA.  Why don't you let *him* decide whether something will be a ""pain in the ass"" or uncomfortable for him."
c4hasg,"NTA - you wrote it, you decide what happens with it."
c4hcv4,NTA.  You don’t have to accept an apology.  I am sorry your party turned out this way but congrats on graduating!
c4hdhb,YTA for basically stealing then damaging his property and not thinking there is anything wrong with that. Not sure how you think it's ok to take things that aren't yours and just keep them. Are you a toddler? Because that's a very childish way of thinking.
c4hgji,"NTA:

That was an extremely low-tier comeback, it's almost impressive to me that someone could be offended by that. If he constantly makes fun of you then what you said is fair game."
c4hk9q,"NTA. They are waaay to Young to watch porn, particularly with opposite gender cousins. 

You were the adult - you kept them safe."
c4hlfv,NTA. I think your dad needs to go. I doubt he can change at his age. He has zero interest in contributing and you have a kid who is likely being exposed to stuff you don't want them exposed to. Kick him out.
c4hlgl,"NTA. He was late. He was rude. He is clueless. It’s all on him, and he can’t handle that so he lashes out at you. Happens all the time. Don’t give in. He needs to learn."
c4hn0r,"YWBTA.  That is super passive aggressive. 

If you want to be treated like an adult in the relationship,  talk with him like an adult, and show him the FB pictures as an example.

Do not air your dirty laundry on FB.  Even if you think you are being sly, you won't be."
c4hptv,NTA - That is not a friend.
c4hz7l,"ESH. You ate her cookies despite the note. So you’re in the wrong in that aspect. But you replaced them. So, unless that particular pack of cookies had some sentimental value, she shouldn’t care.

I initially wanted to say NTA, but her note does shift that responsibility/obligation to you."
c4i0k7,"YTA. If someone’s personal bedroom door is closed, you should always knock . It’s called manners, look it up"

c4ig4a,"NTA- your mom left you then came back to take advantage of you once your father passed, shows no care for or willingness to fix your comfort in the vacation situation; and most likely will find another way to take advantage of you in the future. 

I’d try to enjoy my time on vacation still and then cut my losses"
c4igae,ESH- You two don't really seem that suited for each other. You're not getting the intimacy that you want from her as a partner. She should recognize your asks to do activities together is a token of your desire for her. She seems really cold but what keeps it from being NTA is that you've gone so far in this ignoring pretty obvious signs.
c4ignd,NAH.  I think you both just need to sit down and have a good conversation about how to be more communicative with each other.
c4ih9y,NTA but you should have told the mom you did not agree to watch it before they left.
c4iiqv,"NTA, you're being honest and that's what makes a good marriage. From what you've described, there is a chance your marriage wouldn't last another pregnancy and it's much better to say it now then have the breakdown occur. Also, although physical contact shouldn't be the be all or end all part of a marriage I feel it's still important as it's a way of expressing closeness and love for one another."
c4ij0j,Wtf is an alternative black guy
c4ik4y,"I mean, NTA... you’re not obligated to stay in an unhealthy and/or toxic environment. However, I think you’re a bit delusional if you think this won’t  essentially be a break up entirely."
c4ilcp,"NTA, small improvements can be nice, especially when you don’t have to do them, but it’s your property. If you don’t stop it now, what’s to prevent them from tearing up the entire lawn or installing a fence 10 feet on your side of the property line? I’d thank them for what they have done, but make it very clear that if they do something to your property without your express permission, that there will be consequences."
c4ilpr,NTA.  Of course you don't have to be cool with your parents lying and using you as a prop to further that lie.
c4imly,"NTA - she's just being fucking weird. Why would you want to force someone to go see a movie they don't want to see? That's just bizarre. As for wanting to spend time with you, going to a movie is a horrible way to do that - you're just sitting next to a body, not spending quality time."
c4inj6,"ESH.  Yeah, it was rude of them to have sex in your house.  But if you think it's cool to cut off *all* of your friends who want to associate with C, then you're an even bigger AH."
c4ipd8,"NTA.  You know what they say, ""You learn more from your losses than from your wins.""  Hold out till the end!"
c4isac,"NTA, you pay rent, and you're not hurting yourself or anyone else. If they have a problem, they need to learn to live with it or move out themselves. You're willing to compromise and be as unobtrusive as possible, they'll survive."
c4itt7,NTA.  Celebrate with your loved ones who love you back.
c4iuxv,"NTA, while it seems nice she's trying to plan for the long term with the settlement+will situation. She is trying to hold that over you. 

The baby should always come first, if you were to move in I see that putting a strain on both the baby and your relationship. 

She made her grave, let her lie in it. Sucks but she went this long without even seeking a support group. If she's struggling with money, cigarettes aren't a cheap addiction."

c4j6i2,"NTA 

Yeah, people are going to say you should appreciate that he did it for you, but I don’t think so. You repeatedly said NOT a MAC I want THIS one. And your half of the costs being more than the entire laptop you actually asked for. 

Your father just wasn’t listening to a single thing you said. He’s the entitled one here. “I bought you a gift, now be grateful and pay me for your GIFT”. That’s hardly a present when you have to pay for it and you specifically said you didn’t want a Mac many times. 

You were better off saving up and just buying it yourself."
c4jab8,"It's about $440 AUD, about $310 USD or $594 NLG."
c4jbcj,"NAH. It’s fair that your friend wants to celebrate you, especially since you always go all out for everyone else. But it makes complete sense that you don’t want that, and your friends should respect that. Friend will be TA if he continues trying to throw a party for you."

c4jiza,"NTA .

That doesn't erase my responsibility for my behaviour ."
c4jq5q,"Bloody hell! Yes, you fucked up.

Your boyfriend's MOTHER died. Not his neighbour, or friend or coworker. His MOTHER. And as his partner, someone who allegedly loves him, you should have been at his side at the funeral. Your family have come off as incredibly selfish here, so I can see where you get it from. My mother would have been like ""Goodness, of course you have to go!""

How on earth were you able to enjoy yourself, knowing that he was more than likely having a difficult time? Yes, he would have had his other family around him, but he clearly wanted *you* to be there. And I can guarantee that the rest of the family weren't impressed with your decision and it was 110% discussed. ""Where's X? Why didn't she come? She's in *Cabo*? Eh?"" And the fact that he even offered to reimburse you for some of your outlay, shows how badly he wanted you there. But you chose other people over his needs. In addition, you went with your mother, which would just remind him that he doesn't have a mother anymore.

Personally, this is a dealbreaker and I would break up with someone over this. Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot?? Your mother dies, and he's like ""Soz, but I'm still going to go on the bros holiday. We cool tho, right?"" How utterly selfish and self-centred of you.

Ugh. YTA. You are SO the asshole here. And no one can convince me otherwise.

c4kdzb,"YTA. 

Too much of a not-so-humble brag going on here. 
Encourage him to attend and take that opportunity now while his acceptances are still valid. Going back later is much, much harder. 

Find a different way to encourage him to go now if you think that is the right thing. He is an adult and will choose his own path ultimately. 

I wish my parents were half as supportive as this when I wanted more than anything to attend college. Find another way to accomplish your goal."
c4kemq,"YTA. That’s creepy and weird. Don’t do that. You hang out with her brother, you already have an in to talk to her in non-creepy and weird settings. Don’t be a creep just because you’re scared of rejection."

You need new friends. These people don't treat you like one."
c4kwpy,"NTA and her dad knows it. When you pull a prank you're putting skin in the game, so you can't complain if it cuts both ways. You paid the ER bill, which was a standup move, your girlfriend is being unreasonable."

c4lb24,"NAH. Be sure it won't impact your career negatively, then absolutely do it.

Best of luck."
c4lof4,YTA for assuming it's his fault and should be blamed. Unless she gave him your contact info he has no legit way to get a hold of you without violating her trust and some form of stalking. I think the better question is why did she feel the need to hide it from you.
c4ltvj,NTA. He needs to learn how to respect boundaries. A quick apology would have been appropriate.
c4m35h,NTA - Your sister seems to understand having lots of dogs in someone's house is disruptive and messy but only cares if it's her home.
c4mdc1,YTA. How many times do you need to smoke during one meal? You should have told the waitress that you weren’t done and spoke to her directly. She has to pay for that food now most likely.

c4mmpf,"Not gonna offer judgement, just tell you that your dad is wrong.  In the UK, you can own property as ""tenants in common"" with a partner, where you specify % ownership.  So if she will contribute say 35% of the mortgage, then she can have 35% ownership.  You can also adjust it in the future if your circumstances change and she is paying more.  

Get legal advice, not Dad advice.

Edit: NAH"
c4mtee,[deleted]
c4mwtc,"Just to play counterpoint here, I don’t see anything in your post that says there were other costs unexpected besides the fact that the food bill was higher than you thought?  Splitting like that is pretty typical.

But yes, YTA if you drop out of the wedding over that.  Not only are you in the wedding, but the issue has nothing to do with the groom."
c4nery,"NTA, how were you to know?"
c4neyy,"NTA; go for it. In fact, you might want to explain  your family's financial situation not only to your sister, but also to the boyfriend. You said that ""he doesn't understand our situation because he never got to live it,"" so make him understand that what he's asking isn't a good course of action for your sister."
c4nfvu,"NTA. There's no reason your 22-year-old brother shouldn't get a job. But, if I've understood this correctly, I don't think you can deny him his share of the money his father left him in the will, and telling him to get lost and never speak to you again was not the best solution to the problem. What you definitely CAN say is that you're not willing to support him with the money you earn, and if he wants to continue living in the family home as an adult, he does need to get a job and contribute to expenses."
c4npin,"ESH

Your daughter, wife and her ex- for obvious reasons.

But you, you seem to be treating a relationship with your step-daughter as a transactional relationship.  A good portion of this reads like you're mad at her because she's chosen her dad over you--even though it sounds a lot like she's treating him the same way.  In the span of a couple of paragraphs you describe a girl who has had pretty bad parenting (at least from a standpoint of teaching her responsibility), but then you're more than willing to punish her for not knowing the things that the parents should be teaching her.

I'm step-dad to 4 kids, so I get the notion that sometimes it sucks to have to deal with the results of less than perfect parents, but if you've been with her for 14 years this is on you, too.

You all would be within your rights to let her sink or swim on her own, but being within your rights doesn't make you a good parent, or stop you from being an asshole.  Being a parent is more than paying the bills, it's also teaching them how to live on their own, and prepare them for a time when you're not paying the bills.

Talk to her and set up a schedule for a managed retreat from supporting her.  E.g., if the phone and insurance is $300/month, tell her you will pay that for the next 3 months, then start reducing it by $25/month.  Tell her you want to help her get set up in her own life, but there will be a deadline for supporting her if she's not going to participate in her own upkeep."

YTA for the way you're looking at this human being--- who's supposed to be family to you---who just lost her life partner. It doesn't matter how his death happened, and you're within your rights not to help her financially... but come on... show some compassion!! Also, her son died too?

The reason i said NAH is lets get put in his shoes; hes disabled, he doesnt have a lot going on. He cant do as much as other people. And its harder for him to make friends. Hes probably lonely."

Stealing from charity is a shitty thing to do but this was not a value that would make a difference to anyone and you've potentially risked someone's job and livelihood for something incredibly insignificant."
c4onka,NTA - I'd be ticked at your husband for ignoring your feelings on the matter. It's one thing to tolerate him as your husband's friend and another for him to ambush you
c4opuv,"NTA - I'm pretty sure you're allowed to decline paying for a meal if you didn't eat it at all.

c4owck,"YTA. But barely. It's understandable for her to want her partners support during such an upsetting time. I get what you're saying and empathise where you're coming from, but they say funerals and wakes are for the people left behind, not for the departed... So its largely irrelevant that you didn't know the person in question. You should want to be there for your partner, it's not for you to say they have enough people for support."

c4rb8v,"YTA.  Your wife is right.   Swing shifts are going to make it difficult to see much of your child; you'll be working or sleeping a big chunk of the time the child is awake.

Other kids have Mom and Dad at Thanksgiving dinner; yours won't.

You're risking offending someone, and therefore you have to go the extra mile to be absolutely sure that whomever you are doing this with is totally ok with it. You didn't do your due diligence here and ended up hurting your friend because of it."

Proper protocol would be for *someone* to get a social worker involved. This woman (intent means nothing) cannot be touching other people's things, contaminating ice machines, nor potentially killing residents by allowing them outdoors if they need supervised. 

Tf. Why is no one doing *anything*???

Go to the social workers office or to your family liasion's office, tell them the situation and tell them you need help in making it stop. This woman is a risk to others in the facility, as well as herself if she doesnt stop touching things that people dont want her to.

What can YOU do directly (after the above mentioned)? Go to your activities director and explain you have a busy-body resident who youd like to attend more activities to help keep her occupied.

Having weed when you're a smoker like he is for many (myself included) is considered as much as a ""life expense"" as gas for the car. If you're paying for these things however, he either needs to step up or stop. 

THAT BEING SAID, I think a compromise would be ""I will stop bringing up your pot usage if you agree to see a professional about your anxiety.""

And what also happens in my family is that my grandparents would much prefer for our younger generations to be cared for than the older generations. Your family's overreacting especially if they accepted your proposal and got angry afterwards, regardless of how reluctant it was.

Rescuer here. 

It's a controversial way of training. Some people don't like it (myself) and some people do (my boyfriend).

Really, end of the day is that it can reinforce fear. If the cat sees YOU squirt him, he associates you with fear.

HOWEVER, training ALWAYS differs based on animals. 

If your cat has no signs of anxious behaviour and is still incredibly forthcoming and affectionate with you, then the squirt method isn't causing problems.

For example, I allowed my boyfriend to use the squirt method until I realize it was causing one of the cats to fear water (she freaked out when I misted a plant). So he stopped doing it to her and switched to the clicker and now she's fine with water again.  (For ours it's exclusively for 3am zoomies)

(I just shriek/hiss at my cats, aka language of thier people).

Your girlfriend is right that it can be cruel for cats.

You're right that it can be a useful training method. 

Since you share the cat find common ground and as long as the cat isn't showing an adverse reaction, you're honestly fine."

c50bki,"NAH. You’re not wrong to feel the way you do, but for your friends, their kids a are a major part of their lives, so naturally, that is what they would talk about the most."
c50cfi,"NTA - I’d be disgusted too being told I was a product of incest, sorry OP"
c50oet,NTA. She’s old enough to drive herself. It’s called being an adult.
c50ptm,"NAH you did right by your cats. She was 16 years old and a cross country move and learning to be indoor/outdoor would have been too difficult on her.

You did the right thing for your cat. It was something that was really hard for you to accept because it doesn’t feel right, but what you did wasn’t selfish at all. I hope you feel good about your decision to have another cat someday."
c50r70,Aren't repairs like that the responsibility of the landlord anyway?
c50s4i,"NTA

It's your money; do with it what makes you feel comfortable. I think you're being very generous to pay for most of her schooling and I understand why you would feel uncomfortable continuing to support her after this. But have a discussion with An about it before announcing your decision.

I don't think the 16 year old is necessarily the asshole. I think the husband who is expecting his wife to continue to pay for her stepdaughter is TA; if he feels so strongly about it then maybe he should take over more of or at least an equal amount of the financial burden.

Edit - fixed a word (wrote your instead of her by mistake)"
c51018,NTA. Was she high?!
c5102e,"NTA- 

It sounds like you were pressured to agree to it, if you let her know now she still has time to find somewhere else. 

I’d recommend relationship advice might be a better sub, so you can get more advice than judgement"
c5103r,"YTA:

C was courteous enough to tell you that she was uninterested in being friends with you (instead of just ghosting you like a lot of people do) and you went and did that? I actually agree with C, you were being immature."
c510mq,"NAH. There’s an easy solution to this. Show the film to your friend first, before you release it to everyone else."
c514gr,"NTA

The proper response from her would have been ""Sorry but did you guys forget to leave a tip due to the machine error or was that on purpose?""

Anyone who automatically assumes someone is an asshole is an asshole themselves. Especially in a situation like this. Come on lady don't jump automatically to nastiness."
c5164t,"NTA OMG my husband’s “best friend” is exactly like this. My husband flew across the country to spend time with him for a week when his girlfriend broke up with him (they got back together a week later) and he couldn’t even be bothered to come to our wedding. His own needs are clearly more important than my husband’s. I only wish I could make him see that.

That being said, your bf does not need to be a doormat for Alan. I think you were right to say something. He needs better friends."
c516bm,"Tell him you want him out by x date, with at least 30 to 60 days notice from the date you tell him this. He's lived there 11 years...give him.some time to get out. But if he's not out by that date, then yes, get an eviction notice. YWBTA if you just got the notice without verbalizing your actual intentions of wanting him out much, much sooner than ""no rush.""  

It sounds like you have been being taken advantage of a bit, but it also seems like you haven't stood up for yourself or communicated your feeling in strong terms, either. Speak up with clear dates and desired outcomes, then follow with action if you're not being heard."
c518o3,"NAH

You're not an asshole but for your own good and your wife's convenience you should consider taking driving lessons (controlled driving setting) or doing something to get over this fear. It's hurting you, friend, and you don't need that. You can overcome this :)"
c51aqd,"YTA:

You're being way too paranoid about this, it's like you think that people will automatically go through his phone and read his messages just because he has no lock on it. I agree that not having a lock on your phone is stupid, but you're not this guy's mom. If he wants to put himself at risk, that's his own problem. Threatening to cut him off over this is way over the top, too."
c51hdb,"YTA. Use your own bathroom, it’s not hard. If it’s too dirty for your liking, then that’s a sign that you need to clean it."
c51iup,"NAH. I don’t think she purposely tried to spite you by inviting others over- I think she just didn’t understand. Especially since she invited another family with kids over to play with your own daughter. But you’re not the A hole for not wanting anyone else over while you’re out. There’s a lot of safety issues involved also (but your own personal reason is good enough). However if your babysitter continues to invite people over & not listen to your wishes or give you a hard time about it, then she would be the A hole."
c51pkj,"YTA for making me read this dribble. 

Tow the car!"
c51qbs,"ESH. It's his password, but he should be thinking positively instead of being stuck in the past. Why isn't he over her?"
c51vgf,I think setting boundaries on stuff would be a good idea.
c51wo3,NTA. Actions have consequences. He needs to learn his.
c522yb,"YTA, since you main intention is to go and see your ex, that has made it clear she doest want to see you, who paid money to not be bothered and just wants to enjoy the show. I feel for you though, its a shitty situation, The best advice is to just be happy that they are happy without you, and don’t dwell on it. 

... unless you just go to see the band, then NTA."
c524rv,"NAH. From what I read, it doesn’t look like you’ve said anything out of line to these people and no problems arise from it."
c52645,NTA. He should have talked to you and your husband about this before impulsively getting a dog.
c526ff,"Yta 

You cannot be serious 

His brother his even worse 

""Like an absolute freaking idiot and terrible person, I had an affair with a supervisor. It's one of my biggest regrets. I'm not gonna blame it on anything, it was my fault and it breaks my heart to know I broke such a good man. Robert was devastated when he found out and to this day, it's been two years since our divorce, he's still a different person than he was before.""


Are you trying to kill the man!?!?!?"
c527c0,NTA something shady is going on or it is possible the teacher is just lazy or inconsistent. Either way you have a case to get the grade changed
c5280y,"YTA

This harms no one, and you’re doing your neighbor a solid by letting his contractor do a liquid.

You can ask him to go around the project though.

To be clear, you aren’t wrong.  It’s “your” portapotty.  But you are the asshole."
c528gt,"NTA

Progressiveness has come full circle I guess? 

I imagine they had good intentions, trying to make sure you knew it was fine to be gay, but instead wound up just being a huge mess. 

But ultimately no, you're not an asshole for getting upset about someone trying to label you like that, and you're not a homophobe for denying being gay when you're not gay."
c528j8,"ESH, this seems exhausting"
c529nb,"NTA. If you can't afford to pay for your car getting towed, then don't park it across people's driveways, simple as that."
c52ame,"Neither. Don’t put the kids in the middle of this. Let it go. Don’t make a divorce situation any harder. Trust me, my parents did, and it’s brutal"
c52b7a,NAH but you played yourself son. Better luck next time.
c52cl4,"YTA. 
 
You're responsible for your dog's behavior and if you can't prevent it from attacking another person, you have to do something about that. You can't blame being attacked on your sister. This is an incredibly dangerous situation that you are responsible for as the dog owner."
c52jeb,"This is a tough one but gunna go with a NAH and a “but don’t do it” caveat.

People express their love differently. Rejecting the way she expresses it—when it’s not hurting you—will hurt her.

Your “it’s annoying” reason is valid but the “I only send authentic love messages” isn’t. It’s different but not worse than how you express love.

The most I would say is ask if she could not text you during work hours except on your lunch break. Or put your phone on do not disturb / her messages on snooze.

Plus, this sounds like a honeymoon phase thing. I imagine it’ll fade."
c52jyj,"NTA, she handled that rejection extremely poorly."
c52k6b,"NTA. Your girlfriend sounds very insecure, you did nothing wrong."
c52l7g,NTA. TBH the manager should be grateful you're so eager. Definitely NTA.
c52mnz,"As a teacher, NTA. I would have made him do the project alone and given you a partner. 

Also, I would never give groups out this way. Invites bullies to bully. But that’s not the point here. 

You probably should’ve talked to your teacher first though... 😉"
c52or5,"YTA. If you hadn’t tried to get revenge, than you wouldn’t have been the asshole."
c52w7g,[deleted]
c52yiw,You know you're NTA. I'm glad your husband is on your side in such an overly dramatic situation.
c539dp,"Maybe you should have talked to him. ESH because he didn't let you bring your girlfriend, but you didn't talk to him, and kind of handled it like a child in my opinion. If you talked to him, it could have been avoided, imo."
c53bvv,"NTA- you did right by telling him and you kept your promise you told him after the fact. 

 ""I promise Janet that I wouldn't let him know ahead of time and I would wait for Greta to tell him."""
c53dad,YTA - why did you let her finish before complaining about making a lactose intolerant meal? She went out of her comfort zone to do something special for her and you shit on her feelings and effort.
c53g2u,"NTA

You’re an adult. She’s an adult. You both consented.

I don’t think I would have hooked up with someone on a family holiday like that and I think you could have been a little more discreet - go to a different beach than the one your family goes to etc. But I don’t think you’re an asshole for doing so."
c53m66,"I think it's a ESH situation

Him, for knowing you had feeling for this girl and carrying on with his adventure with her

You, for getting mad at something you had the means to change, before your friend put himself between you and her"
c53rht,"NTA. If she genuinely wants the issue solved, you’ve given her the way to go about it."
c53xfz,"ESH. Dude, she's healing from a major surgery. She *does* need help getting around, and likely needs extra food to help heal her body. 

That being said, I'm sorry she has problems that have had a really negative impact on your life. You're not obligated to accept or love her."
c53z4a,"ESH - your coworker doesn’t sound like the best person, but a skill you need to learn in life is how to work with people that bother you/you don’t like. Stooping to their level and calling out things you find annoying is only making things work and contributing to the toxic work culture at your office"
c540l6,"NTA. But be prepared for her to say she’s ready to make some big changes and she needs your support, followed by more of the same."
c546en,">I am not afraid of commitment

>That, and i don't want any consequences for us splitting apart


NAH, but i think you should think about it more carefully."
c548aa,NAH wondering what kinda work your doing and why dont you look into moving onto another job or is the pay really good
c549jl,"NAH. Sounds like someone's got a crush.

&#x200B;

GayGorn and his girlfriend sitting in a tree.

K-I-S-S-I-N-G

First comes love, then comes marriage.

Then comes GayCorn in a baby carriage."
c54de5,"Yeah for sure! I definitely get where you're coming from in terms of not wanting the brunt of the financial load. But at the end of the day she's an adult and it needs to be her decision to get a job and save up. The fact that this hasn't dawned on her already is part of why I think she sucks. 

In telling her she ""needs"" to get a job and ""we decided she'd apply to x jobs a day"" and wanting proof of those applications is where you come across controlling. At this point you sound like a parent more than her partner. Again - I see why you're doing it! She can't be trusted to do it on her own, but that doesn't mean you're not being controlling...if that makes sense. 

You need to communicate with her that you can't/won't pay for another visit. She's an adult. She knows what she needs to do. If she continues to not pull her her weight, you need to decide if this relationship is one worth sticking around in. Personally, I wouldn't blame you if you decided no. But her lying and only doing these applications because you're gonna come around to check her homework isn't sustainable and isn't going to get you guys anywhere. Treat her like an adult and if she won't act like one, end it and date an actual adult :)"
c54mp0,"NTA 

You should look into labor laws and consult a lawyer. You'll most likely end up leaving that company in the end but at least you'll have some seed money to keep your finances in check."
c54ozo,"I'm leaning between NTA and NAH. I know for sure you didn't do anything wrong and that you're doing what you can to take care of your family (which really should always come first and I have a huge respect for you), but I want to say your best friend cares about you because she wants to travel and have fun with you but the ""you don't have a life"" thing sets red flags. If a friend can't bother to understand and sympathize with your circumstances, it may be best to cut it before it becomes toxic. I do hope you do something fun or relaxing for yourself once in a while, you sound really busy and best wishes to you and your family!"
c54ulu,"YTA. The term “bad form” is on the nose. Friend or girlfriend, you should’ve taken A home."
c54yia,"NTA, I’m actually going to be a bit of an asshole here and say your dad only got back into your life cos he wants the money. Don’t give him a penny, he’s a grown arse man and he got himself into his own mess. Also, as someone that watched a family member lose their home trying to help an addict relative who then proceeded to drink every penny they were given, the absolute worse thing you can do is give an addict a large sum of money. You owe this man nothing, he did nothing for you throughout your entire life. 

I know you feel sorry for his kids but you’re not their dad. I feel like you’d be hurting them more by giving him money when you know they wouldn’t benefit from any of it anyway. I really don’t see how you think you’re an asshole, you made the right decision."
c5570j,NTA. If I were her I’d want to know. If she already knows I think she’d appreciate the fact that you cared enough to mention it. Be really gentle though and think through how you’re going to say it. Please do not use the word scandalous. Try and keep it very neutral with no negative or taboo connotations towards the photos.
c558vj,"NTA really I think based on
- just hugs and quick kisses not making out in the main areas
- you said it hasn't been an issue with anyone's previous partner"

c55jsa,"YTA. It’s a very short notice, honestly. I mean, if they weren’t a friend they would’ve probably taken a (non-refundable) deposit and your cancelling would’ve at least left them with that, but since that’s not the case, so yep, YTA."
c55lg6,"NTA. I understand you feeling like it’s not your place to say something, and you’re absolutely right in that. Besides you don’t know factually if it’s true, so it’s better to indulge in it."
c55lip,YTA but not for telling your cousin- just for not telling her in the first place. You only did it cause you wanted to punish your aunt after she talked bad about you not because you where really concerned for her.
c55owy,"NTa. 


It's public parking. 

Yes sometimes it sucks when you can't park, but that's a part of life. 

They are being unreasonable and rude."
c563c8,"YTA. 

Your story doesn’t hold up. You say you know her quite a bit, yet you didn’t know for an extended period of time that she was in a relationship?

“I don’t have feelings for her (ANYMORE)”

Sure. Feelings just come and go, and surely there are no underlying romantic intents in you inviting her to prom, right?"
c564iw,"YTA. It's not your job to force your daughter to challenge herself. Life will challenge her enough as it is. Soccer isn't going to ""benefit her future"" any more than cheerleading will, which as I understand it is pretty challenging anyway.

c56cvm,"NTA, I would be mad too, you can't just give up a responsibility you promised to do!!!"
c56gus,"NAH, you can try once. If he doesn’t reply, you know his answer and then you have to leave it at that.

Trying once is okay, stalking isn’t."
c56iqv,"NAH - and you have my total sympathy, because I understand what a terrible decision you have to make is.

However painful it is, it sounds like this opportunity to leave is going to be the thing that secures your family's future. And that includes the family you will leave behind, including your son.

Please consider writing him a letter, suitable for his age, which explains your love for him, and why you are making the decision to leave, and how grown up and admirable it is that he understands it - and cement with him the fact that he will always be your family, and that he has a place with you when he wants to visit, or as he grows older.

Having something physical to hang on to and read may be very important for him as he grows up, and help comfort him when you are not around.

c56kpp,"YTA.
This sounds unbelievably entitled and embarrassing.
Whatever issues you have with your father aside, there’s a point in your life where you need to honestly grow up - you’re pretty much an adult now. 

It seems like you have no emotional interest in amending your relationship with your father but rather have dollar signs in your eyes - and base the absence of such a relationship almost entirely on financial support and material possessions. 
Not only that - but you’re not even asking for necessary help. Supporting you through university doesn’t equate to having a fancy room, hundreds of dollars a month and shit you don’t need.
What do you bring to the table as a daughter?
I’d be ashamed if i was you and this appears kinda bratty."

c57tgz,"Nta, but seriously grow a backbone, she is only 5!!!!! Demand it back!"
c57uuh,"NTA - you were right, she is being selfish and obsessive, but she is only 15 so it’s to be expected. I’m sorry that no one in your family seems to be prioritizing you. I think that maybe if you talk to your sister about how you’re feeling and explain where you’re coming from, she might understand and realize how her actions have hurt you. It would also behoove you to apologize (as you were planning to) simply because that will lessen the tension between you two, and that won’t help you enjoy your birthday."
c57wdz,"YTA - for thinking she owes you something because you took her out on vacation. It’s obviously fine to use a free voucher on a friend, but you’re angry at your girlfriend about missing out on past opportunities instead of being honest with her. She is not obligated to give you every outing that you want, and it doesn’t seem like you’re talking to her about why it upsets you.

All you had to say is “we missed out on the camping voucher last time and I really don’t want this one to expire/miss this opportunity again. Would it be alright if I took X friend out instead? I’d like to do something nice on my birthday”.

Your selfish mentality is the reason I’m saying YTA"

Honking at him wouldn't teleport him off the highway, it wouldn't tell him anything he didn't already know, and it didn't make anyone safer.  You were just being a garden-variety asshole.

e: I want to point out that there is some merit to the idea that letting the other driver know they *really ought to* get off the highway is useful.  I do personally believe in 'corrective honking' in general. However, passing them at the earliest possible minute or flashing lights would also give the same indication in a less aggressive way.

The fact that they had to be told more than once means they don’t think they did anything wrong and still think they know better.  They are still acting like what they did 30+ years ago is going to work now.  Their temper tantrum shows this and that they still think they know best.  

You absolutely should have said something and should again if you let them watch your LO.  Let them act like petulant teens, your child should be more important to them than their pride."
c59tqn,"YWBTA if you sleep with someone while you’re in a relationship unless your partner agrees to it. You forgave them for their indiscretions, that doesn’t make it okay for you to sleep around."

as someone who personally suffers from sleep apnea, this is ringing my bells. This, however condensed, sounds a lot like me.

As a mom dealing with a very stubborn 5 year old, we've had similar dealings. I don't see it as abusive in any way. If she wanted to eat it off the plate, she shouldn't have thrown it. She'll learn to behave more rationally by dealing with the consequences of her actions. However, I have figured out that there is a level of stress (even if it's self-caused) that my kid can handle. After that point, it's all irrational nonsense until they have calmed down. So I hold off on punishments or talks and let them sit it out until they're human again. Good luck with you're baby sitting. I say you're doing fine.

Edit: I only say this is NTA assuming that the floor was clean. I wouldn't make any kid eat mashed potatoes with fuzz/gunk/dirt in it, that's disgusting and just plain mean. The sandwich would have been fine, again, as long as the floor was clean."

A good sit-down with her to discuss (have notes to stay on topic) WHY you made the decision you did, and what she can do to improve her chances in the future would be appropriate, including telling her that you appreciate her skill, but that degrees are less important than work ethic.  Maybe she can take the opportunity to learn, and improve her effort."

c5fbyq,"NTA - you’re under 21 so you can’t drink or pay for drinks. You even stated that you would be willing to split your friends dinner 50/50 but not drinks, because you would not be drinking. That is completely fair and May is trying to cheap you out"

c5gzj7,"YTA for not keeping a calendar mate! Not THAT much of an asshole, but if you don’t fix it and this becomes a recurring thing, then you suck. For me, scheduling weekend activities has become a lot harder in a relationship because I’m not just accounting for my friend and family events but my gf’s too. It’s hard to keep track of it all in your head and starts to become a “thing” between you and your partner if one of you forgets an event that is important to the other, or prioritizes the “wrong” event when double booked (as you’re seeing now). Start writing these things down so you avoid these little conflicts altogether. 

For this case - you’re not really an asshole for picking one event over the other. I’d just think through which event you want to be at more and decide, understanding you’ll have to hurt someone’s feelings. If it were me, I’d pick the tournament because it can’t be rescheduled and it’ll make your gf happy, and apologize profusely to your parents and aunt and uncle, and arrange another night you can visit them or take them out with your gf to make up for it."

I feel like a lot of people are going to say NTA because they love fireworks... buuuut. When I was a kid, I went to a friend's family's house and they lit fireworks off. A tree and then a house caught fire. Since then, I am fucking terrified of this type of fireworks. You don't know Rachel's situation and whether or not her horses were scared. Even without the personal side for me...

When you grow up and are lucky enough to own a house, being considerate to your neighbors is pretty important, even if you disagree with them.  You need to be on good terms so that you can look out for each other and see each other all the time. Your dad probably plans to live there a lot longer than you do, and wants to stay on good terms. He doesn't want to ruin the relationship over something this petty. It's his call and you should probably let it go.

Your reaction is so bizarre to me. You are his sister, not his parent. And he is 24 - more than old enough to make his own decisions. Hell, he's old enough that this could have been a planned pregnancy (though it sounds like it wasn't).

I stopped speaking to her when I was 16 and it's been over 10 years.

I completely get where you are coming from and if you don't want to have a relationship with her that is your decision but it is one that you have to live with. I don't regret my decision to cut out the toxic. But just make sure you understand  that if you tell her you don't want a relationship, it's not easy to fix afterwards. You could tell her that she really hurt you and you need to understand why. The teenager excuse to me is a bunch of bull and she is hiding behind that. If you decide that you want to work it out then all the power to you. You don't have to be her best friend or her mentor. You're not an asshole, you're hurt and you're allowed to be."

c5jh3h,"IN FO will you be asking him to move when you’d like to use it, or are you wanting to place a blanket ban on him sitting there? EDIT: NTA, sounds like an issue of a roommate monopolising common living areas, speaking from experience that can be pretty annoying."
c5jhaw,NTA. Just because you're back under your parents' roof doesn't mean you've suddenly lost your adulthood. But your mom is probably going to need a few gentle reminders about that.
c5jiax,NTA and his reaction is a big red flag
c5jkzo,"NTA You we’re making the safe decision and the one you’re most comfortable with. Nothing wrong with that.

It’s also in her best interest. Imagine something went poorly and she had to tell parents she trusted their children’s lives with an untrained person who was against doing it anyhow."
c5joj5,"NAH - I don't think you're the asshole for asking. However, it seems like you're doing the same amount of driving regardless of whether or not you are driving her, with the exception of the doctors appointment, because it sounds like you're passing her house on the way to school and that you'd be going to your friends house even if you didn't have her with you. If how I'm reading it is correct though, since she is a friend, I think if you required her to pay gas money for a ride to school you'd be the asshole."
c5jpkv,"NTA. It's absolutely ridiculous to ask your family to take in some girl that they've never met, and that he's only been dating for a few months. You also have reason to suspect that she's troublesome. Not your problem!"
c5jsiu,"NTA. I have previously referenced the Asshole Parent I haven’t seen or talked to in 15 years. I have no regrets, even when they attempt to contact me through other people or stalk me online. Keep close to you the people who treat you well and let the rest go, with good will and grace. Hope you find peace, no matter what you decide to do."
c5k01d,"Nta but I would not want my 21 year old nephew dating a 33 year old, nor my son when he's that age. Wouldn't want my daughter dating a 33 year old man when she was 21 either. 21 is still too young. It's not the age gap, it's the age."
c5k1ao,Nta. But maybe let your siblings help you make things and just let your mom have the night off?
c5k40l,"lmao what?

NTA. Dumb zero tolerance policy."
c5k4gj,"NAH. You and your friend both enjoy these meet ups; she so much that she wanted other people to experience how awesome they are. You felt like it was an exclusive thing, and she thought it was worth sharing. What you have in common is how much you valued getting together. I hope you can both come back to that."
c5k92e, NTA.  If she's not willing to compromise you need to take care of yourself. Its either that or be homeless. She's probably not going to take it well though.
c5k97t,"YTA on the basis of not being a good team player, and having a moderate amount of intellectual superiority complex that you repeatedly tossed in their faces."
c5k9eo,"ESH - You aren’t obligated to be your friends therapist, especially if it’s weighing down on your own mental health. But definitely could have been nicer about it."
c5kblh,NTA but it won't work.
c5kcrl,"ESH - Your mom spent money to spend time with you. She shouldn’t have been on her phone in the first place, but you could have simply asked her politely to put it away instead of trying to get away from her while she was actively trying to spend time with you"
c5kn3a,"NTA. You proposed to her once, that should be enough. There's no reason she should try to convince you to do another proposal, and especially not a public one. I don't understand why she wants you to do this whole song and dance just to basically show off to her family."
c5kpb6,I wouldn't call it camping if it's in a house lol
c5krav,"NTA

You were smoking in the smoking area"
c5kvm0,"YTA

Turn it into the police station...

Why do you need Reddit to tell you that?"
c5kzp9,YTA. You shouldn’t be cancelling on someone last minute. Especially with this kind of time commitment involved. If you have anxiety issues you should never have committed in the first place.
c5l9p4,Why don’t you make both of them your maids of honor? It’s not unheard of y’know. That way they’ll both receive the honor and no feelings will be hurt
c5l9q7,NTA I would have enjoyed my free cookie and not bought one. That’s shitty sales tactics 100%
c5lk7r,"NTA 

There's clearly something mentally wrong with him. Whether due to some kind of abuse or emergining mental illness, there's a problem that needs addressing. If you are incapable of providing the care that he needs, then the government can and should take over that role."
c5lone,"“Hey come join my thing”

“Okay”

“Hey nvm fuck off “

c5lqpf,[removed]
c5lwbt,NTA. You don’t want someone else’s piss poor parenting to disrupt your life. I can’t say I blame you. If worst comes to the worst I’d make sure everything is well out of reach of them
c5lx3b,"NTA. Being old and/or blood-related doesn’t excuse toxic behavior and discriminatory beliefs. If it’s too much emotionally, it’s too much- your family is insensitive to expect you to tolerate weekly harassment just because it’s your grandma."
c5lxx1,"NTA. I have a disabled sibling as well, and have been through exactly what you’re describing. However, as my sibling has matured and I’ve grown up and moved out, our relationship has gotten better. Hang in there. And try not to blame your parents, they are just as overwhelmed as you, guaranteed."
c5lyib,NTA!! She’s not a deity but she sounds like a dictator. You’re not an asshole for not calling your MOTHER ma’am. I’m sorry but I’ve NEVER heard a mom do that before.
c5m00m,"NAH as things stand but I have to say YWBTA simply because fixing mannerisms can be touchy. You don't KNOW for a fact that he learned that out of a book or that he's actually a robot in human skin. That could just be how he talks. Would you tell someone to fix a stutter? I would just learn to deal with it. If it does become known that he is trying to do this actively, then I feel like you are within your rights to provide constructive criticism."
c5m3d2,"NTA- Don’t Foster for these people. If you want to foster dogs, find a different shelter. These people are creepy and have no boundaries."
c5m58d,NTA - Who in the hell does she think she is? I used to use this as a punishment to my children but in adults? She needs to grow a pair.
c5m5yy,NTA. Your mum is seriously toxic and manipulative. Have you talked to your other siblings/family members about her? It may be time to start supporting each other and withdrawing from her insane grip of control she has on you all.
c5m88i,"ESH.

Jesus Christ this is all over a fucking wedding dance performance. Your cousin sounds pretty unpleasant and controlling, yes. But if she is that way in general, THIS is the most meaningless battle you could have possibly picked."
c5mcyb,"NTA, you couldn't help it. Normally better to be able to let them know a bit more beforehand but sometimes it's not possible, especially as you were trying to work through it."
c5mf4e,"NTA.  She has insecurity issues that are not your problem.  You’ve made it clear that you are not replacing her.  I do this with the guys I golf with all the time.  If one can’t make it, we’ll call up another, no biggy. I expect the same when I can’t make it too."
c5mg4p,NTA but perhaps you should look into charging a cancellation/late fee. Being flexible is great but at the end of the day not having a set schedule will lose you money with possible clients.
c5mgtn,"NTA. Since he doesnt get to see you often,  he should put his social life on hold while you visit.  If I was you,  I'd let him know if he cant show you some respect while you are visiting, then you wont be visiting."
c5mh5i,"NTA

You had a spark, even if not long lasting, with Paul and it took off. You did nothing wrong because there wasn't a relationship between Paul and Samantha. Also, you didn't do it on purpose and even though you were kind of friends, I think you did the right thing by doing what's best for than what's best for her."
c5mi5h,"YTA - lies in this type of situation are only a way to avoid having a tough conversation. Instead of deciding for your partner include him in the conversation. Let him make decisions and contribute. 

&#x200B;

Perhaps suggest that you'll pay for accommodation (you can say it's because you've fallen in love with a particular place that might otherwise be out of your budget)  and he can cover other activities if that will help him rationalize it. 

&#x200B;

I think it's worth figuring this out sooner rather than later though because its a small lie now but what about when it turns into multiple small lies or bigger lies? Will that be okay? Face up to difficult or tricky conversations and find a way that works for both of you."
c5mkmz,"YTA. She clearly loved her pet and felt a connection with him. Not only did he die, but she feels guilty about it. She feels like she failed him because he depended on her. I know that can seem silly, but it is understandable."
c5mmuu,"NTA/ESH Mom has issues, don't know if she wants to admit she wants help."
c5mp28,"ESH, you both acted like awful, petty fucking people and it’s amazing your guests had the patience to sit through your bullshit. They all deserve medals."
c5mp91,"Definitely NAH. The gaming community can be so shitty to women. It shouldn’t matter if you’re man, woman, or non-binary, all they need to know is you’re fun to play with. As a fellow lady who games as well, men get so fucking weird when they find out you’re a girl. It’s not worth the hassle tbh."
c5mph9,NTA - No do the right thing.
c5mwh3,"YTA for wanting someone else to pay for the wedding you want.  If your mom's requirement is she pays for a church wedding then your options are have a church wedding or pay for it yourself and have the wedding you want.  When someone else is paying for your shit, you don't get to be picky."
c5mzh5,"NTA because they weren’t hers to give and then she expects you to be happy about it. But your dad has a point, they were probably better spent on the homeless kids. They should have asked first though"
c5n2mu,"NTA.

&#x200B;

But, it won't stop them.  They'll just drive over the plants."
c5n40c,"NTA yet- like you said, it is your mom's money. The best way to approach it is to maybe ask her in a way like maybe she forgot instead of being confrontational and accusing her of lying. Maybe she did forget, December = holidays which is a busy time for people."
c5n68p,"NTA

Is he her pimp? What’s going on here?"
c5nayl,"Report the fundraiser, NTA. Some peoples children."
c5nbfj,"NTA, especially if you've talked to her about how uncomfortable her behavior makes you. Sounds like she is pretty toxic."
c5ncrx,"NTA

If they do not want you to change diet they can't complain. Also WTF. They cannot forbid you from eating what you want."
c5nf3t,"YTA if you were having the phone call loud enough for them to be bothered. If you really want to call, talk quietly, or worst case scenario, text for a bit. It's late, people are obviously trying to sleep. If you really wanted to call out loud, you could have gone to a common area that wasn't right next to someone's bedroom."
c5nied,NTA - Find another job. Then go to your bosses and say 'I need a salary bump and two underlings to help with the workload or I have another offer.' They'll either come round or you can walk without any guilt
c5nlgx,"NTA 

They’re toxic. 

As you get older you realise you were only friends with some people because of proximity, school or happenstance. 

You’re better off without them in your life and screw apologising for their snowflakiness."
c5npke,"NTA, I understand this is a major inconvenience but sometimes it's nobody's fault, even though the communication would definitely have helped."
c5nxdz,NTA- If they can’t afford to put them in kennels then they shouldn’t go on vacation.
c5nzhw,"NAH, you're within your rights, and brothers will fight. You value your stuff and thats cool.

&#x200B;

Edit:Wrong acronym"
c5o0ky,It was an accident and maybe your nephew should have taken his grandparents health and age into consideration before he planned a ceremony in an uncomfortable location unlikely to accommodate them. Your wife could have maybe told you to sit next to her dad instead of placing herself in  spot that would interfere with the task she assigned you. It also really sucks that she’s treating you like you shoved her elderly parents to the ground when all you did was lose your balance. You’re surrounded by assholes but you’re not one
c5o0zh,"NTA—Sounds like you might have [misophonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia).

>Some small studies show that people with misophonia generally have strong negative feelings, thoughts, and physical reactions to specific sounds, which the literature calls ""trigger sounds"". These sounds are apparently usually soft, but can be loud. One study found that around 80% of the sounds were related to the mouth (eating, slurping, chewing or popping gum, whispering, etc.), and around 60% were repetitive...  
>  
>Reactions to the triggers can include aggression toward the origin of the sound, leaving, remaining in its presence but suffering, trying to block it or trying to mimic the sound. The first misophonic reaction may occur when a person is young and can originate from someone in a close relationship, or a pet.

I doubt mentioning this to them would help at all, but food for thought (*I'll be here all night ba-dum-tss*)."
c5o1ah,"NAH, why would you be rude trying to accomodate a non English speaker?"
c5oay2,Wow my brain hurt from reading that. YTA for using abbreviations like that.
c5odlt,YTA if they gave you an information sheet and you didn’t bother to read it
c5ofq7,"NTA and it is your business. Drunk drivers kills children and families, so thank you for speaking up."
c5oomu,"YTA seriously you sound like a 14th century Puritanical. Let people do what they want my dude not your place to judge at all. Cringing at the phrase ""if people like you didn't spread your legs"" as well, who says that to a friend?"
c5oxvi,"ESH. Move on, dude."
c5oya0,"NTA, but I think your girlfriend needs to find a new roommate asap."
c5p482,"NAH.  You're not required to have a relationship with him, but to be honest, I'm sure you've matured and so has he.  You do have common bonds (family ties) and he has been the one to extend the olive branch.  You might want to slowly see if a better relationship is possible"
c5p9oe,"You're not the asshole for trying to contact him, like the title would suggest. But you continue to try to contact him even after he has made it clear he wants not contact with you. He has no obligation to talk to you, accept that for now and maybe try again in a couple of years.

YTA for continuing to contact him after you knew he didn't want you to."
c5p9tl,Nta ..but be prepared...your MIL is going to be running the show (and your marriage) forever
c5pdv4,NTA.  Everyone who has ever worked in a service industry knows and hates that customer.
c5phh5,"Without knowing all the details about why you're not getting along with your mom and sisters, I would say NTA. You're not obliged to include what I assume are toxic people at a very personal event in your life."
c5phxa,"Nope, NTA. They need to train their dogs, not doing so is 100% a dick move. And seriously, they complained about their dogs being wet?? These people do not understand animals at all 🤦🏼‍♀️"
c5phze,YTA.  It’s even more sad that you are trying to defend/excuse your actions.
c5pi4a,NTA - your mama doesn't have a medical degree and acid reflux can cause some serious damage to your stomach lining and esophagus. Even ulcers. Go for it.
c5pk05,"YTA 

She’s out of pocket for the fuel. 

She’s using her car. 

She’s racking up miles of wear on it. 

She’s the one who can’t relax and sleep or something on the way back. 

She can listen to whatever the hell she likes."
c5plf8,"Actually, calling someone out whenever they are compulsively lying is one of the best ways to get her to stop. You are actually helping her. Yes, she should feel bad for getting caught lying. That's how it works. NTA"
c5poc5,"NTA

He says it's cheating if you simply hang out with male friends?

Are you guys 12? Jesus, dump him."
c5pqds,">Would it be too much to tell her to focus on her own style

that would make you NTA

>because she dresses like a 10 year old?

add that part and YTA

stooping to someone's level does you no good and i guarantee a snotty 15 year old will make your life a living hell if you do"
c5pqif,"NTA, he’s avoiding the papers it would be an AH move if this was the first time you were trying."
c5pzwo,"YTA if you tell them. Just because you wouldn't want to be surprised doesn't mean they wouldn't. It's a really nice gesture, and they'll probably see it that way. 

There are so many people in this sub with families who hurt each other. If your problem is a mom who likes organizing ""pretty cute stuff"" to celebrate a new person joining the fold, that's a pretty cute problem to have."
c5q0pl,"NTA. Your mom is hurt, but she shouldn't have given you an ultimatum. Your an innocent party in all this, and you shouldn't be expected to take sides. Tell your mom you love her and sympathise with her, but she can't expect you to stop loving your dad."
c5q14w,"Definitely don't CC the entire office.

Sit down with HR and explain to them that Linda is why you left, then leave. (Or do nothing) Don't burn more bridges then you need to."
c5q1rx,YTA. If you dont like it stop freeloading and get your own place
c5q2sc,"NTA - End of the day, it's your property. You have told people to stop and they won't listen. They are the assholes and not you."
c5q4lx,"NTA. If she accrues debt on that account, you are liable for half of it. You should be able to ask the bank to freeze the account on basis of marital dispute. I’m sure once she’s unable to access it she’ll agree to close it quickly."
c5qbmn,"NTA - she botched everything with her exemplary decision making, she can make amends. You're all out $250+ already cuz of her stupid ass decisions why should that be $325+?"
c5qjmw,[deleted]
c5ql00,YTA for sending her a message two months later for absolutely no reason.
c5qmea,NTA.  You had an agreement with them and they decided not to adhere to it.
c5qqdx,"NTA - mom should have asked you, your gf, your roommate who is still living there and gf's parents if this was ok.  Your mom was probably just trying to be a nice person.  I would be just as uncomfortable as you are and wouldn't want anyone staying in my place when I am not there.  I understand you don't pay rent but I believe you still get a say in this since you have to live there."
c5qqhc,"YTA, either go and bring something or don't go."
c5qtpx,"INFO: Are you going to tell her to be a bit more quite and courteous or are you going to ask her to stop having sex? You pose both questions in your title & last sentence, but I would have different answers for each."
c5qu8f,"NTA.

At all. These people don't care about you ans don't respect you. You deserve sooo much better."
c5qved,"NTA,

you have your own problems. Don´t let other´s problems add to them."
c5qyom,[deleted]
c5r10z,[deleted]
c5r1pa,"NTA: 3 weeks notice for a wedding, when you already have a vacation planned during that time? That's nonsense. Your uncle and family are being completely unreasonable."
c5r2sw,"ESH. Demanding someone speak to you first thing in the morning is silly. I'm a slow to wake up person and morning time is me time. I like to fiddle around on my phone in silence. 

But also he's being childish and untrustworthy. I don't care if people talk to their exes if they're genuinely friends, but there's a big red line in the sand if it's an ex who doesn't know about his LIVE IN GIRLFRIEND. This makes me think that there's very little chance he's not being duplicitous. Sorry. What a jerk."
c5r3hf,"ESH. I get not wanting to be filmed because its embarrassing, but ""my gf allowed me to smoke."" Like wtf, own up to the fact that you wanted to get high, it was no one else's decision but yours."
c5r4n4,"NAH.  I mean don’t call her crazy.  She could be undergoing through some sort of undiagnosed schizophrenia.  Stick with her and encourage her.  I’ve read on here about people who were undiagnosed, then started to receive treatment and it turned their life around.  See what you can do.  It’s gonna be work, but someone has to help out."
c5r4v7,"If you think someone is being abused call the police, and let them sort it out.


Edit: YTA for assuming they’re illegal and calling ICE for abuse. This is clearly a matter for the police, they can contact ICE too if that’s the case."
c5r5jx,"NTA: seems like a toxic human being and you not need him in your life. I’m sorry that it’s your dad, but you don’t need that."
c5r7c1,"If you step into this mess, YTA.  The jewelry is your grandmothers and she can do as she wishes.  Any promises are between her and her daughter (your mother).  You need to steer clear of the issue.

Estates, passing down of family heirlooms, jewelry, etc is a very sensitive issue that needs to be handled by the direct participants in a polite way.  Unfortunately this is not always the case.  I have been involved in these things (unfortunately) many times simce both my parents died when I was in my 20s and my grandparents died before that.  Luckily my brothers and I were easily able to navigate the family heirlooms, jewelry and such.  Communication is the key"
c5r7x3,"YTA.  Just stop.  It’s unhealthy all around.  Quit being vindictive, he’s an asshole, I’m sure he knows by now.  Live your life without completely making someone else’s miserable."
c5r7yg,"YTA - You were pretending to support her while secretly believing she would either give up on it or fail. You shouldn't have continued the relationship knowing that you wanted very different things out of life, secretly hoping she would drop her dream so that you could have yours."
c5rb22,"NTA. Your neighbor is being ridiculous. A simple “thanks for signing for my package” would have sufficed perfectly fine. Unfortunately though, doesn’t seem like you’ll be able to help the delivery guy in the future, unless you know the neighbor...

EDIT / Clarification: I don’t mean that you shouldn’t accept packages because you can’t or that you’d be liable... but because if your neighbors are gonna be jerks about it, it’s not worth the hassle."
c5rf3q,NTA. It *would* be a logistical nightmare to have a 1yo on a trip like that
c5rhph,I’ll support anything that saves us from another gender reveal video.
c5rok6,NAH. You can genuinely tell them you had a prior commitment.
c5rts6,NTA.  Stick to your guns.   Your graduation party is meant for a different crowd with different tastes in music and entertainment.  Everyone (except Mom herself possibly) will have a better time if the events are separate.
c5ru2b,NTA. The server was wrong and unprofessional for hounding you about the tip. She also tried to steal that dollar from you without even knowing how much you intended to tip in the first place. I would have reported her to management for that.
c5rw4z,"YTA. I would have responded with ""you might not be as strong as your brother, but you can work on it!"" instead of calling her chunky. She's 11 years old and is probably already insecure with herself, she didn't need her aunt calling her chunky."
c5ry6q,"NTA.

> ""we should have a long talk, somewhere private. I know I haven't always been the best dad but I have some stuff I need to get off my chest""

IT'S A TRAP.  You hope he's going to apologize, but in all likelihood he is going to explain to you why he was right all along.  Dude emotionally abused you.  He has given you no reason to believe he's turned over a new leaf.   If he actually wanted to apologize, he could be doing it over the phone, or in a letter; he wouldn't wait until you literally were trapped.  That's what ""we should have a long talk, somewhere private."" means.

It would be good to explain to your girlfriend that your dad emotionally abused you, and that being around an abuser isn't good for you.  She may be putting her ideal of happy families ahead of the reality of your unhappy family."
c5rz8z,"Clearly YTA

your smoking is bothering your neighbors in their own homes.  you're harming their havens.

smoke outside.

>Contract doesn't say anything about smoking at all. Shouldn't I have the freedom to do whatever I want, within reason, in my own damn apartment I pay an outrageous amount of money for every month.?

You're confusing what you can do with what you should do.

you're legally allowed to be an asshole.

we don't address legality here."
c5rznw,"NTA, but I would say “hate” is a strong word. I get you’re frustrated with him and his behavior is really irritating, but try to keep talking with him about it and remain civil for as long as you can. Discussing these problems with him instead of your dad might help fix the problem."
c5rzpn,NTA. Little kids need to learn good manners and how life works in general. You did nothing wrong.
c5rzta,"YTA - just be honest with her, you're too old to be lying to your parents."
c5s2dw,"YTA: I would have said ESH, but oh my God you sound like an ego maniac... You didn't want to tell them life updates because you figured they would be jealous of you? You couldn't take just one night of them making the frankly OBVIOUS jokes, and getting it out of their system? It's fucking funny, you should have laughed and let it go. If they keep doing it for years to come, come back and ask again and we'd tell you that THEY are being the assholes."
c5s4ey,NAH. Offer to be the designated driver for them :)
c5s5ja,NAH- you’re letting her know from how it sounds from your point of view. There is nothing wrong with that.
c5s71t,"NAH - it’s your ex, she is with someone new. You can be friendly there’s nothing wrong with that but I’d just move on with my life. They’re going off in different direction and you don’t even live near one another. You don’t have to be rude I’d say still be friendly but it’s time to make a clean break."
c5s9sv,[deleted]
c5senw,NTA. How does your family not know about your brothers prior treatment to you??
c5sfh9,"NTA. She gave you a gift, it's a milestone, you two are friends of sorts, I'd definitely get her a small something. I'm more concerned with the reason why BF is so against it."
c5smap,"NTA, I think you DID try to defend her. Your president sounds like a piece of shit. Maybe you can take him aside another day and tell him how inappropriate his comments were and how insensitive he was being, especially about how he seemed to be treating transgender people as a ‘representation-I’m-so-woke’ thing and not a these-are-actually-real-human-people thing."
c5sn9y,"NTA.  You pay for everything and she is still trying to control you.  Take a good deep look at how she's handling this.  This will be your future with this woman.  You get to be her ATM and provide for her, then get told what you can and can not do.   Just kick her out."
c5so6k,"NAH, but welcome to the life of renting. It does seem unnecessary though to say something seeing as you moved in 4 days ago and this is the first you've heard. I would've waited until it actually became a problem, like if you heard them every day or something."
c5spj2,"NTA. 
It's your garbage can and an extension of your property in a sense. 
I mean it's nice that people are even picking up their dog's poop anyway, but some people may not realize that it's a personal garbage can or something. 
Anyway, point is do it. If people choose to get mad or hate you then they're petty and unsympathetic so you probably didn't need them in your life anyway."
c5srad,NTA. You follow your countries guidelines and sought advise from a medical professional. You're good.
c5ssjy,NTA. The only part of this post that is relevant whatsoever is the part where this animal has a history of snapping at people. It would be MASSIVELY NEGLIGENT OF YOU to continue to keep this animal in a home with a small baby and anyone telling you otherwise is a fucking idiot.
c5suau,[deleted]
c5sv0s,"YTA you already told him it was fine and you weren't expecting the money back. It would be nice of him to pay you back like he said he would, but to hold him to it, especially after your friendship ended, just comes off as petty and like you're trying to punish him."
c5sxlg,"YWBTA if you sell it. You made a promise and you're trying to sell it basically because you can, not out of necessity."
c5t3gv,No idea what I just read.
c5t7zl,"NTA for asking. If you dont ask you cannot get. But dont be surprised if they say no. They may want someone in the office in case of an ""emergency"".  There is nothing to lose by asking."
c5t82u,"NTA and your sister is being fully TA here.

A 16 year old is not an adult. Teenagers are hard to handle, and it sucks that you are in this situation. 

Perhaps give him a choice. He can come back only if he participates in the household chores. Let him decide if he prefers the abuse from his mother. If he does decide to come back, you will have to ride him on doing the chores (yes, even if he agreed to do them), and cop any backlash from that, because suddenly you are the parent and that's what all parents cop.

He doesn't even really like the other girl, he just knows he stands a good chance at some action. That's a really gross way to view women. I hope the other girl does end your friendship, because she deserves better friends, that don't sexualize her.

I think you need to start setting expectations now. Your salary and money aren’t up for discussion or for grabs.

It’s incredibly rude for your grandmother to literally have googled “your salary” and broadcast it. It’s too late now, but I think you need to work on shutting things down in future without offering more information. Something like “*That’s a gross over exaggeration.*” is all you have to say."

You wrote a lot here, so I'll help you out with some free editing:

>Soon after meeting my partner's children I ran into conflict with his troubled younger daughter to the extent that my partner seriously considered leaving me because of it. Not wanting to lose my relationship, I decided that I would pretend to care about this child. I used my educational background and things this child revealed in therapy to round out my deception. I successfully convinced a girl with a troubled relationship with her mother to think of me as a loving maternal figure, saving my relationship with her father from ending.

>However, I now feel the deception is no longer of any value to me. I have successfully secured my relationship and I no longer want to expend the effort of pretending to care about this girl. I am worried that emotionally abandoning my soon to be stepdaughter (much like she feels she was abandoned by her actual mother) may end up being inconvenient or awkward for me, though, and I have realized that marrying her father may mean I will have to interact with her long term. Am I the asshole for manipulating a child into loving me and then choosing to discard her now that she's not useful to me?

I'm going through something similar where my ""brother"", (best friend since 4th grade) can't be bothered to return a text/phone call despite knowing my life is in shambles and could use an occasional conversation to sort things out or even just to talk to someone besides myself. He has plenty of time for video games though, so there's that."
c63sp5,"NTA. Just leave. They’ve made it impossible, and your way older brother lives there. They can’t rely on you to house sit if he’s literally living there being useless"

It's the wedding of your wife and you, it's not the marriage of either of your parents. You mom should have asked both of you before ordering anything.

(Though I think it's a bit harsh to rethink your marriage)"
c63y9b,"YTA - big dick move, and a good way to let your friends know you don’t value their friendship"
c63zmc,"NTA.  You’re documenting and creating a paper trail to protect yourself.  You’re never the asshole for protecting yourself in a safe manner, regardless of the offender’s age."
c641a4,"NTA. You are not an asshole, your mom is not an asshole, your obgyn is a giant asshole. Yelling at patients is extremely unprofessional. You should change doctors not because you are embarrassed by what your mom did but because your obgyn is a piece of shit."
c64afz,NAH.   But your mental health issues are interfering with your relationship and your everyday life.    It seems like you need some more serious treatment than just therapy.
c64fjp,"NTA.

Tell them they need to pay up. It's unacceptable that you pay their bills, and they get to keep all the money they make from their jobs. It's simply not fair."
c64hhh,"NTA. You're being reasonable. I think the mistake was going all that way and assuming everything would be fine even though he's never made any effort to meet his grandchildren, his guest room ""wasn't ready,"" and he wasn't willing to meet you at the airport. Those things are okay in themselves, but all together it does paint a picture of someone who isn't used to putting himself out for other people."
c64kiq,NTA but I suspect your feelings are tainted by this jealousy you harbor.
c64mi9,NAH. Do what you want with your life. And experience and skills are much more important than a degree. You can always finish college later if you want.
c64mjk,"NTA, but be prepared to lose your best friend and anyone who sides with her. Are you ready for that?"
c64prg,[deleted]
c64stj,YWBTA although if you did tell her YWBTA also. This is one of those no win situations.  He deserves to be left alone if he so chooses but she also deserves to know her father is dying. If she wants to make peace she probably won't have many more chances so you should probably tell her and leave it up to her.

Weight is a sensitive issue so I understand why she reacted the way she did to what you said, but at the end of the day her size is influencing your ability to go out and do things together.

Who knows, maybe this could be the kick she needed to work on her health and start taking care of herself more"
c653zb,"This isn’t really a case of you being an asshole as it is you not leaving enough time before appointments. They’re asking you to do it earlier, so do it earlier from now on. You didn’t know, so you’re not an asshole. If you do it again, you’re being an asshole. NAH"
c654xk,NAH. Your cousin seems fine with it. You're fine with it. Your parents are fine with it. Everybody's fine.
c655m2,"NTA - I mean there isn’t really much for you to do. If you confronted the dad, what good would have that done? It’s not like the dad was going to change and immediately become a better father. If anything that would’ve escalated things and put your safety in danger, as well as the kids, and could have caused a lot more problems for the kids at home. Situations like these are hard to watch but you can’t do much without jeopardizing the safety of the kids and you."
c655rl,"NTA. He's a 9 y/o kid. He just feels thrilled that his big brother (sister?) did something cool for him.

Better idea: Pick him up after school and teach him how to make the eggs. It's how I started to love cooking."
c656bt,"YTA. How exactly is it not your fault? You had the bike, you let it fall, etc. “Someone messed with the gears” - first I find that very unbelievable. Second even if someone did mess with it, you didn’t check the bike before moving it. 

This is your dads prized possession and he generously lets you, a beginner rider, use it. You weren’t stripped of your driving “rights”, you were stripped of the massive favor that your dad was doing for you. 

Sorry about your leg. But your #1 problem is not taking responsibility for this. Maybe your parents wouldn’t be so mad at you if you owned up and apologized instead of acting like nothing was your fault and you DESERVE to ride the bike and be given a car."
c65bne,"NTA . A library is a library, not a nursery and not for catering to the stupidity of an entitled mother."

Lol you're an adult, use your words and tell them you don't want to go because of the reasons you listed"
c65dk3,"NTA. What you said was completely fine. I don’t really know why she’s overreacting the way she is. Maybe she’s just nervous that she’ll lose you as a friend because you’re in different cities with conflicting schedules, and this hit her a little harder than it normally would because of it? IDK."

For one, this is the second time you've posted this story, in case you thought you were going to get different responses this time.

Secondly, I'll restate the answer I gave the first time: Absolutely. It's a summer job. You should've just waited for him to get there to work. Don't rat on people for unimportant things, it only comes back to haunt you."
c65ru7,"YTA. He is not sick, he is not dying, hip problems can be tended to by vets, and so can bowel stuff. You basically want to put down a dog because he is inconveniencing you. Of course you are an asshole."
c65rvv,"NAH, good of you to try and help your friend with his project, but you won't be helping if you hold the project back. It's best to just be honest and tell him he should look for other artists to help (or at least more artists so that you're not trying to do it all alone)."
c65s2d,YTA title is bait
c65sjv,"I think YTA.

Just because it doesn't sound like your GF is being malicious. She's standing by your side. And it doesn't sound like your ex is using your GF's friendships to get at you. And it sounds like in your area it's hard to make friends who *aren't* connected to your ex."
c65t3p,YTA dude lol. You said yourself they were in new packaging. You’re being an asshole.
c65tz8,"NTA. Tell him you found multiple cars for $100 but he insisted on going with the other guy and gave you no choice in the matter, so it turning out to be 3.5x more expensive is completely on him and he can pick up the excess."

>I just don’t see myself with someone who is gay because I am straight.

He's bisexual. He is attracted to women. You are a woman. If you were to tell me, ""He was really into queer culture and I felt weird being in those spaces,"" I'd be more sympathetic-- but you didn't even know he was bisexual until he told you after a few months, and you've made it clear that this is purely about the fact that he is bisexual, not about queer culture. That's homophobia. (Technically, it's biphobia, but there's some overlap here because you don't like that he's dated men.)

The other stuff, about how you were feeling burned out and didn't want to date him, are reason enough for you not to date him, but you are specifying that it was related to his bisexuality in addition to those other things. You never have to date someone you don't want to, for any reason, even if that reason is rooted in prejudice. But you should certainly examine your biases and try to figure out why you feel this way and work through it."

c66thr,">Cindy wants to send me a check with the cost of the couch plus the cost of the movers, then I pay the movers whatever they quoted her.

That's a scam.

The check will appear to clear at first, but later it turns out it bounced. Your bank will demand the money back, at which time you already paid the 'movers' and lost the couch. Don't fall for this."
c66wsx,"NTA, you’re dads depressed and taking it out on you."

Why on Earth is this trip happening?  Your MIL needs to stay put and people need to come see *her*.

I'm sorry it's tough to talk about, but you need to have your husband figure out a way to stop his parents from taking this trip.  I don't know anyone that would even consider doing this given the circumstances.  My grandmother is 93 and still very ""with it"" and she wouldn't consider going on a 6 hour car ride."

PSA you can have as many middle names as you want.... so you could keep your original first name and last as one of your middle names. I know I know, this adds a bunch of letters.... but would still keep it short on your drivers license I think.

c67o7s,"NTA - I'm going to go out on a limb and say you work in the US where the work culture is ""don't take vacations because then you look like you're slacking""

But realistically this is a such a toxic culture. Sick days are for just that, you're sick regardless of if it is physical or not.

Take a few days to get back to a place where you feel well.

Edit: As another note, never try to compare your struggles to someone elses struggles. You shouldn't beat yourself up for being taken down by mental illness. Everyone has their own threshold and theres nothing wrong with saying that you need help or cant handle something.

Promote a good understanding of mental health, which is to respect that everyone struggles differently."

c69hpm,"YTA. You are putting her in a difficult position and for what? You are not thinking about what is in it for her; you want her there for you because otherwise it would be **extremely noticeable**. On the other hand, you want her to ask her parents violate a boundary they have already set (not getting into the ridiculousness of this if she is of age) and potentially strain their relationship to where they will restrict her more.

c69xkf,"YTA

Truthfully not because you don't want to be friends with her - I think it's fair. If you're interested in someone and they're not interested it can be really hard to have a good friendship. But if the way you said it to her is any way like the way you wrote it down in the post it was tactless and unnecessary. 

""Jillian, I like you - I just don't think I can have a friendship with someone that I'm interested in."" is far more appropriate than ""I don't want any contact with you and can't be bothered to put in \[dating\] effort if it's just going to be platonic!"""
c6a26n,Talking to your best friend's ex and planning to meet up with them is a really shitty thing to do.

c6a6z4,"I have no judgement other than to say, visit your parents.  Communicate with them and find a way to work through this.  I'm not trying to minimize your feelings, as they are valid, but you admit your parents are old and struggling but accepting.  Are pronouns really worth not seeing them and then living with regret later?  I don't know, I'm not you so I can't say, but it seems like your parents are good people who love you.  Visit them and love them back."

Your choice is your own and important to you and you don’t want her in your life at this moment. They need to respect that too, and if they feel morally compelled to let your mom know when you’re there, then you’re going to have to stop visiting for a while."
c6bhms,"YTA - I love going to the park, but I have no kids. I'm lucky I'm a woman, otherwise you'd call the cops on me. I'll be happy to apologize if you update us and it turns out he was a creep"
c6bi6j,YTA. This fake food allergy uptick has started to turn into a “Boy who cried wolf” situation for people who truly do have life threatening allergies to certain items. It makes it less believable for others and can result in serious consequences. Just tell people firmly “Thanks for the invite but I don’t eat seafood and my food choices are not open for negotiation or discussion”.
c6bkno,"NTA at all, nothing weird about that name, let alone embarrassing.

But people are going to think you and your wife are Harry Potter fans because ""Sirius Black"" is a Harry Potter character, and most people are more well-known about popular culture than about space/astronomy, so be prepared for that."
c6bm8s,"YTA.

they are having a vacation with you, and don't want you stoned, which is completely reasonable."
c6bnbt,"NTA

>She just changes the conversation to her job choice

Sounds like she needs to realize other people have problems too."
c6bnc4,"So this guy wants to spend money on the car instead of sending you to your grandmother's funeral? 

Take the money, attend the funeral, and never speak with him again. He's a loser. 

NTA."
c6bp0s,Every day I read something in AITA that makes me feel truly blessed to live in a quiet mountain town lol.  I cannot imagine the neighbors calling the cops about grass.  Legit cannot comprehend it.
c6bp1v,"NAH, come out however feels right to you! Bonus points if you write it on the cake. Happy BI-rthday!"
c6bqlb,NTA. Maybe the whole throwaway thing isn't as acceptable on Twitter.
c6br58,"Does it matter if you were an asshole? I think you're better off. I cant say whether what you did is asshole-ish, but I'm glad you didnt let people take advantage of you. People dont even see friends as humans anymore, just robots to make your life convenient."
c6bs3z,"YTA

> I thought it would be a good idea to try and help her overcome her fears and we could bond more

You're hardly the worst person to ever exist, but you should have spoken to her about this before unilaterally deciding to take her to a place that is so upsetting to her."
c6bvz8,"It was gracious of you to accept another phone call from him. 

you have done your due diligence, and it's cool to give up on him again.

heck, i would block people that I liked if they did that to me. 

NTA"
c6byp3,"YTA - Shouldn't have told them you're going just to cancel last minute when they're all expecting you to arrive. If you knew you weren't going to enjoy it and had more preferable events to attend, make it clear from the beginning."
c6bzui,"Yup, YTA. You are 16, you aren't entitled to even consider it. All you're going to do is start a fight."
c6c067,"I remember, after a period of being clean, I started shooting heroin again. I had one friend who never said anything. She acted like she always did and was my friend, same as ever. To me it was clear she didn't know, but other friends forced confrontations, dropped me, etc. She was just the same.

Finally I got clean and full of guilt told her all the time during the past year she thought I was clean I was actually using.

She said, ""Yeah, I know.  You've been clean about 4 month now, right?""

Stunned, I said she was right.

Then I asked why she never said anything. 

She said, ""If you wanted to tell me, you would have. You obviously didn't want  to tell me. I respected that. So I figured the best thing I could do for you as your friend  is just continue to be your friend, same as always.""

That was about 30 years ago. She is the only person from that time and that group I am still friends with today."
c6c1pp,"NTA - you have to look out for yourself here, and really if it’s not a lucrative opportunity it’s ok to move on."
c6c76r,"NAH - you don't have a relationship with him, which was your mother's choice, not yours. While you aren't obligated to him, you should consider meeting him and seeing if you want a relationship with him and your half siblings. You might be surprised, but you'll never know if you don't."
c6c91k,"NTA  


I'd be pretty pissed off if someone did that to my cat and didn't own up to it."
c6ccio,"NTA 

You take care of yourself first. There's a chance they can fire you for this, unfortunately, but if that happens it will just show you what kind of people they truly are.... 

Definitely the kind you don't want to work for."
c6ccwl,"YTA.

While I am well aware that red light tickets are unenforceable, you undermined her mother's parenting. Paying the ticket, in her case, is as much a part of the punishment for running the red light and being a dangerous driver, imposed by her mother who it seems she lives with if that's where the ticket was sent, just as much as not allowing her to drive for 2 weeks. 

You are showing your daughter that she should ignore what her mother says and essentially pit you guys against each other."
c6ceex,"Good lord! Leave it to funky relatives to turn something innocent and cute into something untoward! NTA! Btw, I call my little ones booger too. :)"
c6cfab,Definitely NTA: Your mum needs to start taking anxiety more seriously
c6cg1q,"NTA. Tell your landlord, and tell the police if there's another incident. He's clearly training the dog to be aggressive which is a danger to everyone."
c6chlr,"NTA - I don’t think you’re an asshole at all, you have a right to your feelings and I get why you’d feel that way. Maybe start up an honest discussion about this with your father and see where that goes, if anywhere. Sorry, dude I know this shit ain’t easy"
c6cixc,This is what HR is for.
c6cp2b,"NTA. She put you in a bad position by going overboard with the number of excessively drunk guests. If something happened, guess who would be responsible - you!  You did shit on her party but that’s what big bros do."

c6cua7,"YTA

&#x200B;

Men throw fits about women ""leading them on"" when they aren't, and you actually are. People are not toys for you to practice ""strategies"" on. Just be a decent person."
c6cv9a,"NTA, the wellbeing of your family is more important than a car. If it does more harm then good if you keep it then you shouldn't.  Your MIL will hopefully understand. It does sound like your fiancee needs to take a look at her priorities."
c6cwik,"NTA - I actually think you guys are being too nice. Why does he get to opt out of rent for two months and still have an house to come back to as he pleases? If he still wants his room to be there, he has to pay rent to hold his place. I think you guys should have just found another roommate."
c6cxwb,"NAH, but it sounds like she's making compromises already- leaving her home town, and living with a dog. Moving fifteen minutes closer for a few dollars more may be worth it to her, and to you."
c6cz9d,"NTA, they're mooching off of your goodwill. Cut the gravy train off.

Also, who ""borrows"" TP?"
c6d0la,YTA just go to your festival and let him do his own thing.
c6d0pd,"NAH as long as you approach it tactfully. You could say something like: ‘hey FYI, this park can be a little annoying for bigger people and some of the rides have been a little tight for me, so since you’re a bit bigger than me you might have trouble. There might be accessibility info online you can check out to make sure you won’t end up feeling frustrated and left out!’

Source: I’m a bigger person and would appreciate the heads up, especially from a friend I know isn’t trying to be a dick."
c6d0w0,NTA I was just left smh thinking wtf is your dad on about. You clearly did not way to were depressed and your dad sounds absolutely crazy.
c6d1f4,"NTA 

Okay normally I’d call you an asshole for talking shot because if you aren’t willing to say it directly you shouldn’t say it. 


Now that said, you are absolutely correct.   People like that are MASSIVE problems for the national park system.   Visitor management is huge and park rangers CANNOT be everywhere.  

It is absolutely necessary for people to self police the rules in national parks or their destruction will only get worse. 

When people like that are allowed to go unchallenged, they encourage others to act badly. 




That said, next time just call the park rangers from the start for your own safety"
c6d2a7,NTA. It is super inappropriate. She used it an an excuse to dress up and look hot. Next.
c6d5r1,"NTA. It's really irresponsible to give a strange dog a treat without asking. For all she knows, your dog could have food allergies."
c6dh5l,She is 6 so I think YTA. Birthdays are important to children but you could ask her.
c6dhv4,"YTA.  Assuming from what you wrote that you live in an apartment building.  If so, presumably it’s somewhat of a hassle for the driver for them to do that.  Whereas if they were going to a home they don’t really have to worry about going inside anywhere."
c6dji5,"NAH - back in the day that WAS the expected adult standard of behavior (gentle reminders to any child in public who was crossing a line regarding safety).

Edit to fix mental typo in judgement."
c6dld9,"NTA - First off pet rats are very clean and actually super awesome pets. They are very smart and a fantastic and clean pet. That said, anyone renting an apartment has to pay a pet fee. So if room is $250 and you want to charge a $75 pet fee that’s all you homie no big deal. But on the real, you should check out the pet rats they’re a really cool pet my family had several growing up and they’re awesome"
c6dluh,"NTA. That preacher is full of himself. I’m a believer, though not that type of Christian. Being saved, as far as I understand, is deeply personal. You can’t just deflate yourself saved. To be pressured to be saved goes against the personal relationship between a person and God. I’d tell the preacher to leave your daughter alone - it’s her journey, not his. 

In other words - he can fuck off."
c6dlvw,"Oooh this is interesting. Personally, I think the answer is YTA but you should take your money anyways. Sometimes it’s OK to be an asshole."
c6dqmc,NAH You can always fake the video
c6drhq,"NTA, a similar thing happened to me when my roommate started staying at her boyfriends and her reasoning was ""why should I pay for stuff I'm not using"". I had to explain how her plugged in tech and food in the fridge still used up utilities even with her not being there. So no, your roommate is the asshole. Especially if your girl friend is curious about her energy usage at your place."
c6drie,"NTA. She knew what you meant by ""regular cheese"" and was just being pedantic. Cheese by definition is a dairy product, so if anything her alternative is ""vegan cheese *substitute*."""
c6dsty,"NTA - gotta live your life, man!"
c6duw1,"Id say NTA.  If she did it after several days, id say thats understandable. But 15 mins is kind of ridiculous.  Also i bet they wont make that mistake again"
c6dzlq,"NTA, you DID tell her, she said ""go ahead""...right?"
c6e3ln,"NTA, these outrageous bachelor/bachelorette parties are getting out of hand. 400$+ per person BEFORE including the spa day and booze? 

You still haven’t even paid for your dress and wedding gift."
c6e47s,"NTA.  You’re married.  You must put his wants and needs first and he must put yours. 

If you were demanding no contact or only holiday visits you’d be TA.  2-3 times a week every week is fucking ridiculous.  If you both work full time it’s almost as if he spends more time with them.  Wanting him to ease up and spend more time with you is a completely reasonable request to make to your HUSBAND. 

It seems as though he didn’t want to create a family with you, but rather, wanted you to come be in his family.   It blows my mind the amount of people on here saying you should just suck it up."
c6e4w0,"NTA. You are loyal to your mother, and it feels like a complete set up to remove her from your life.

Being responsible for 4 women is a lot at the age you are, and the stage in your career, and was a lot of pressure to put on you.

Maybe see if your mum has better options for marriage 

Also, good luck finding a new job"
c6e5gt,[deleted]
c6e6w5,NTA I don’t understand why your aunt gets the money you borrowed from grandma? Is it going towards funeral expenses?
c6e7me,NTA. I hope you check in with your sister regarding her mental health or help teach her about her new hygiene needs. Puberty can be a rough time and it sounds like your parents are not providing her the guidance she needs. Just try to be tactful.
c6e9n0,"NTA. that’s super unfair. You’re both young and from the context you’ve provided, moving in together sounds like a bad idea"

c6ejqg,"NTA, as a tenant you are only responsible to do certain things, and not what she is asking, and that going into your house thing, that was weird and uncalled for, like if someone put a plant on my mousepad i would be pissed"
c6eob7,"Lol absolutely NTA. Sounds like they were just hoping you'd roll over. Good for you for claiming your living space for yourself, that is not your problem."
c6eq50,"NTA. You're an adult. Your life, your choices, you choose who you want to meet or not meet. Don't even need context for this one."
c6eyak,YTA. Who cares dude? Wedding conventions are dumb and nobody is forcing you to follow them.
c6eyfu,"NTA- What do they want you to do, wait until it does happen to you? If a grown woman is behaving this way over something that was her mistake, not even a bad one at that, then that wasn't the last time she'll act like that. It's highly unprofessional and she shouldn't be teaching anyone, especially future caregivers, that her kind of behavior is acceptable."
c6eyww,"NAH.  And yes,  you're probably over thinking it.  You're on a day off.  It's yours and you're entitled to it. Your boss is trying it on to see if you'll come in. No."
c6eyxe,"YTA massively for considering *taking someone else’s pet* to the pound. 

Yeah, your roommate fucked up by agreeing to watch a dog without asking his roommates first, but how is that the dog or the dog’s owners’ problem? How would you feel if someone agreed to watch your cat for a week and then their roommate took it to the pound?"
c6ezav,NTA. Your mom really fucked up
c6fbzm,"NTA - if they've financially abused your mum, they  should get fuck all. As you said, there's no obligation to tell them they have something available. I'm sorry to hear of your mum's passing, if your sibling gave a shit they'd be dealing with this with you wouldn't they?"
c6fc6x,"NTA - it’s weird to brag about how cheap a gift is. It’s just not really supposed to be the point of it. He’s the materialistic one, imo, since that’s the thing he finds important to tell you about the gift.

Have you told him how you feel about gifts? That you’d rather it be more heartfelt?"
c6fd4t,"NTA. You don’t live nearby. You can’t afford it. 

The rest of your family (and hers) needs to suck it up and act like adults."
c6fgej,NTA stop enabling her.
c6fos1,"NTA. People like him are the reason ghosting became a thing, because he will manipulate you into staying, and possibly hurting yourself. Listen to the people who love you and drop this guy yesterday."
c6fttw,"NAH here, from what you've written. You're perfectly justified in expecting support from your family--that's what family is for! And they aren't assholes solely for not having travelled to see your shop yet. I mean, they could totally be assholes, but just for that--no.  ;)  It mostly seems like a communication issue, and perhaps a misunderstanding of what 'support' means to each of you.

It sounds like you've been bending over backwards to try to keep them involved, and to stay involved yourself.  I'm not going to give you any advice because my family is dysfunctional mess and I've long since given up on my parents--so I don't have any words of wisdom here. But if you guys all love each other, then just keep communicating with them and try to accept them for who they are, as you want them to accept you. And congrats on your store!!"
c6fvj1,"Nta

Actions have consequences. Your sister should learn that lesson now before adulthood."
c6fw1u,NTA. Services like Uber/taxis exist. She should have asked permission first as well.
c6fxbe,"NTA. 
 
It's not your job to pick up your neighbors' trash."
c6fxjz,"YTA.  Sure, they should probably turn their phones off to maximize charge, but it’s kinda weird that this is something you *care* about.  Like, when a customer does this, you *know* they’re charging it for a fixed amount of time (depending mostly on when they want to have their phones back, or perhaps when you boot them off).  It’s the same amount of electricity for you either way, so why do you even care?  

I mean, it’s your bar and you can make whatever policy you want, but this one is just pointless in its unfriendliness, you know?  It’s literally only there because you’re going out of your way to be passive-aggressively dickish to customers.

Edit, in response to your edit:  A blanket ""no charging your phone"" policy when you have the ability to charge people's phones also makes you an asshole.  Asshole. 

Why does this bother you so much?"
c6g0e2,"YTA. You're taking it way more personally than you need to. There was clearly no ill-intent from her side of things, she made the effort to meet up with you when it worked for her and the friend she arrived with. You were the one that missed your train. You *are* being selfish and inconsiderate of C. Why should she have to wait at the station for you, when she could get some food while waiting for you to fix your own mistake? But most of all, what's the big deal? Stop making drama out of small beans and you'll be a lot happier in life."
c6g15g,Talk to your mom first.
c6g872,"That's a bit of a toughie. Came in here with ""It's not your wedding, it's not about you"" fully cocked, but not being able to buy two dresses is a pretty solid excuse. Any chance you could rent the black dress, or have you checked out cheap/used options?"
c6g8zj,"YTA

Driving isn't a game. A panicked driver isn't a safe one, not to mention that he may have lost trust in you as an instructor. You could have punished him by not taking him out for a few days."
c6gcpi,"YTA. By taking away reading time and cuddle time as a punishment, you're effectively telling your daughter that your love is conditional on her behaviour. That's not ok. You need to make sure your child knows you love her no matter what.  

Keep bedtimes normal, no matter what she's done that day. Things like helping to clean up the mess she made, a brief time out, or other consequences directly related to her behaviour are the best. But don't withdraw affection because of poor behaviour--that's setting her up for a rough time."
c6gern,"NTA. You’ve done more than you needed to by already lending them your camera, and then not specifying where you camera is also going is quite an asshole move. Can’t blame you for being protective over your own property, especially when your property is rather expensive. I’ve had my own fair share of camera drama (Canon DSLR) that got damaged so I know how you feel about letting something so expensive go."
c6gihn,"NTA.  She can't expect you to be at her beck and call 24/7 for such trivial crap!  Plus, calling you to send her the photo and then not even hanging around long enough to receive it?  She's TA.  She's learned other new things before; she can learn to use her phone too."
c6go2l,NAH. This issue is well beyond the scope of AITA. Take this to r/relationships
c6gorn,"NTA, sounds like your complaint fixed the problem."
c6gse7,"Nta

It's his fault for missing deadlines."
c6gx42,"NTA. Your contribution to the trip is driving. Considering that you don't want to go, that should be more than enough"
c6gxj2,"NAH. You guys have different priorities and expectations, and that's OK. However, you two are going to have to sit down and talk about this or it sounds like it'll become a serious point of contention"
c6h0ti,"NAH. Except maybe your dad.

Your friend seems to be showing true concern and is generally worried for your safety, but it sounds like she's way more scared of what your father could do to you than you are. It may seem like she is overreacting but considering all the heartbreaking stories of child abuse that gets swept under the rug until it's too late, I think her reaction is totally justified. 

I also think your reaction to her behavior is 100% justified as well. She is blinded by her desire to confront your father and can't see how those potential actions can negatively impact you and your relationship with your father.

I also came from an abusive home. If anybody, ANYBODY, confronted my parent I truly felt it would have been the end of me. My school became aware of one particular incident that they were obligated to report. I begged, cried, and eventually became unresponsive because of the fear I had if my parent had found out and thought I had told on them. Because of my behavior I was committed for a couple days. Your friend should have more sympathy towards your feelings and have more composure around your father.

I would definitely hold back on telling her some details, but I understand that she is a huge supporter of yours. I think the best course of action is telling her your true feelings, that you love having her in your corner, but you are trying to keep the peace until you can leave and can't mentally handle these allegations and threats of confrontation between the two people closest to you in your life atm.

Stay strong and if you need an ear you know where to find me ;)"
c6h2cj,"TIL that ""shouted"" means ""treated"" in some parts of the anglophone world. 

NAH- Splitting bills fairly is a good policy for relationships, especially with partners of similar wealth before marriage. Holding to that means that you are not an asshole. But she isn't either- it's not like she actually called you out- and the only guilt tripping she may have done was nonverbal. 

She has a point though, that it is nice to 'shout' your partner something every once in a while (the 'gifts' portion of the five love languages). But in a financially equal relationship- it's best to keep that to inexpensive things or to pay for meals/activities that were mostly your idea. More ""I'll take her out for ice cream today"" and less ""I'll foot the whole bill for our expensive anniversary dinner."""
c6h3ua,"NAH. However, regardless of whether or not you have a relationship with Bill, he's still your stepdad since he's married to your mother. Keep calling him Bill or ""my mother's husband"" since that's what works for you, but stop getting offended when people refer to him as your stepdad."
c6h540,"NAH. I'd accept the gift since your mother insisted that it's about the intention. They probably both really want you to like him. Maybe suggest some activities that might help getting to know each other in a fun and relaxed way. Maybe he actually likes gaming, so you might be able to bond over that? (Hence the playstation)  


I know it's tough being a 'step-parent' and it's probably harder being the kid in this situation. Make sure your mom knows what is and what isn't okay with you and have her help you set boundaries, so the relationship you have with your mom won't suffer. (I've unfortunately had a bad experience regarding this.)"
c6hawv,"ESH 

You would be an asshole for backing out last minute. Like...maybe I missed it but why wait? 

Just shoot him a message like “hey idk why you’re ignoring me and left me hanging Wednesday. If you don’t want to talk about it that’s cool but I don’t feel comfortable being in your wedding with the current state of things” 

Either he answers or he doesn’t. 

They are assholes for obvious reasons"
c6hl5s,"NTA. If she's offered to pay because she knows you can't afford it, that's a nice thing to do. It doesn't sound like she's expecting you to pay her back, which would make it a gift.

But I think YWBTA if you didn't at least snowboard with your friend. I mean, it sounds like your friend's mother is offering to pay so you two can have fun together, not so your friend can snowboard alone and you can go off and take photos.

It's a generous offer, but you should refuse it if you're not going to want to hang with your friend.

&#x200B;

Edited: Reading another response it sounds like she expects you to pay it back. If that's the case, YWBTA for not intending to."
c6hmxa,"YTA if you bypass your sister on this, yes. You should talk to her about it more, though."
c6hnjh,"NTA - If she didn't want to pay or wanted to split the bill that's what she should have said.

&#x200B;

What she did was offered to pay with the expectation that you would argue the point and offer to pay yourself. That way she gets to look like she was the sort of girl who was willing to pay but without actually having to pay. She was trying to play a game with you and got upset that you didn't play back.

&#x200B;

You probably should offer to pay or go halves in the future but it doesn't change the fact that if someone offers to pay they can't then turn around and get upset when you take them up on the offer."
c6hqze,"NTA at all, especially since you've already tried asking nicely. Call, sleep the sleep of the righteous, and kick arse at those exams, buddy :)"
c6hrgg,NTA as long as he knows beforehand.  Don’t blindside him at your wedding.  Have a conversation with both of them about what song they want to dance to.
c6hwlv,"TBH if it's for your mental health and wellbeing you're better off not going to the trip, NTA since 8 people is a lot and there's definitely going to be arguing.

If it was just you and your parents it would be ok ."
c6hz3m,"NTA Fuck those guys that friend group won’t last much longer by the sound of it, you’d be better off steering clear. I’m sure your bf would understand if he knows what their like"
c6hzhy,"I would personally be happier with the dented original and honesty than a new one that is tainted with lies. Especially as it's sentimental and religious, it's not like you Broke and replaced her TV or something similar without an emotional attachment"
c6i66j,"YTA for sure. It’s perfectly valid to not have feelings for someone despite them having feelings for you. However, it’s really shitty of you to just ghost her with no explanation, especially since you clearly know how *she* felt about *you*. If you had been mature enough to explain to her that you weren’t interested, then you wouldn’t be an asshole. But, you are."
c6i8sa,"NTA 

I would however set firm boundaries with her and explain you would prefer she only calls you in situations where there is an emergency."
c6ihb5,"Id say NTA, it’s your clothes and it’d make you uncomfortable given the nature of the clothing. Offer to help her find a different skirt, like a shopping/lunch day out?"
c6ijh3,"NTA 

My cats used to be indoor outdoor cats and have since become indoor cats.   They certainly weren’t happy about the change but we moved from the country to the city and they needed to get over. 

Which they did.  It just took time for them to adjust 

Beyond that, it’s better for the environment to keep them inside.  Several bird species have been decimated by house cats being outside. 


I’d say no assholes here but it’s a cat... all cats are assholes.   Loveable assholes of course but definitely asshole haha

Edit:   Have you tried walking your cat with a harness?   I have a neighbor that does that, although my cats hate it"
c6iref,"YWBTA Nothing mentions your MIL health situation to endanger your own child wellbeing. You are using it as emotional blackmail, which I don't agree with.

What does your SO think about this?"
c6iu20,"NTA.

I've never heard of people tipping the bag drop agents to be honest, the main roles you tip for are waitressing, cab drivers, stuff like that, where they have all the control over what your night or journey is going to be like, and they're making an effort to make it better for you. 

&#x200B;

I'd say their the assholes though, for trying to guilt trip you into tipping them for literally giving your bags to you, not exactly the hardest job in the world."
c6ixtx,[deleted]
c6iy49,"NAH, you clearly didn't mean it with any malicious intent and you meant the best for him, but you probably accidentally misphrased it making it seem insulting, which, fair enough to your friends, made them stand up for him. It was just a misunderstanding"
c6j8yf,"Nta- at least I don't think so, while its nice he is giving you rides, if a time is agreed on, peoples times and schedules need to be respected."
c6jeg8,NTA. Good luck in recovery.
c6jg0k,"NAH - no assholes here. You didn't cause him to be fired - you caused his employer to kow that you had a problem with him.

They then probably tested his math and realized he wasn't a good fit for their company.

As for A, I hesitate to judge him too harshly as he was just trying to make a living. Sometimes it takes an incident like this for people to find their own level."
c6jn38,"NTA-The remark wasnt vindictive, and it didnt seem to be cruel towards the person who was singing. As long as you didnt actually mock the singing, you're fine. Additionally, your co-worker seems to be a bit OTT for reacting like this."
c6jok1,"Adult bikers on sidewalks is annoying, but I'm going to have to go with YTA for how you're handling it.  You're not training your dog well and putting people at risk when you could simply just tell them"
c6jpxk,"NTA - They're putting all you in an very uncomfortable position, not to mention how horrible the thing they're doing is"
c6js2h,NTA. What a pair of pieces of shit your mom and sister are!

Calling her an asshole isn't helping either.

>I tell her she’s being ridiculous.  She is angry over a barbecue. She says it’s not about the barbecue.

Going out on a limb and saying that trying to get your dad to get her under control and then calling her an asshole has probably moved this fight well beyond the disagreement over attending a BBQ.

>As she’s coming out of the kitchen something I say makes her mad.

Her attacks on you seem abusive, but you are super vague on exactly what you say to her, which makes me believe you're saying things are are pretty abusive too.

If the nephews behave in a way that significantly impacts your daughter negatively (biting, repeatedly taking toys out of her hands, etc.), I think it is reasonable to initiate a conversation with BIL/SIL about the issue. Additionally, if you’re babysitting them you can and should make the parents aware of issues that pop up while they’re in your care and could not be resolved through the techniques you may have employed (reinforcing desirable behaviors, time out, etc.)  This all would make a NAH situation.

At the end of the day though, this is a hard boundary for you, and you need not to care if your husband and MIL get upset. You are being reasonable, they are not.

Your mom needed it gone, and Mike was her way of *ensuring* it happened. 

It doesnt really matter that you've lived at home and paid rent before, as that has nothing to do with the car sitting at your moms. Had you had a car sitting anywhere else, you would be on the hook for storage fees, which you didnt mention paying to your mom.

You don't want to hear this, but I can almost guarantee that that older man has some really creepy control fetishes. Your son is physically disabled, and young and this older man can *easily* manipulate your son. Example: People who have fat fetishes. When their partner starts to lose weight, they have sex with them less often and tell them how they prefer when they were fatter... And then person eats more to get fat again to appeal to their partner. It's emotional manipulation, and it's disgusting. There's no way that isn't what this man is doing to your son.

You did the right thing.

A little background, I work full time and have been absolutely consumed with moving plans. I am moving into my first apartment this Monday so lots of last minute details to attend to. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday was my first day off in over a week so I spent all day at home just relaxing. That evening I worked on getting some stuff together for my move, which wore me out, so I spent the rest of the evening laying on the couch sleeping on and off. Around 8 my sister expressed that she wanted the whole family to play a board game. Now they all know that I really don't enjoy board games and I was exceptionally tired (ended up sleeping on the couch until about 1 A.M. LOL), so I said I didn't want to. I offered to let her come hang in my room so we could put on a Vine compilation and talk, but she didn't want to. It had to be a game. I apologized, explained that I was just really exhausted, and continued to sleep like I had been. That's when she went off. She started saying that I always do this, that I'm selfish, and that I'm making the evening about me. I will also point out that I have plans to hang with all of them tonight and in the morning, so I knew I would be spending lots of time with them. I would rather sleep than play a game in zombie mode. So Reddit, AITA?

If he couldn’t accept your answer and had to go “verify” with your friend or whatever, why would anyone think he would have accepted your honest answer...?

Here's why you're supposed to pack out food waste: If everyone who uses that trail throws their scraps (carrot top, banana peel, apple core, etc.) off into the bushes near the trail, wildlife will begin to hang out there expecting free food. This is dangerous because it opens the wildlife up to higher risk of predation, and because the wildlife will then become a ""nuisance"" to the humans who use the trail, and guess who loses when that happens?

c6mho1,"YTA. Yes, those things can be very helpful and can mitigate depression, but the very nature of depression is that it makes it much harder to do those exact things that you are faulting others for not doing.

And you come off as awfully self-righteous in assuming that because you have done those successfully, others can do so just as easily and successfully as you did. Different people have differing abilities to do these things consistently and effectively, for a variety of reasons. Your depression experience is not everyone's depression experience.

Still, all this might have just been annoying, but you took it to the asshole level when you accused the person that quite reasonably pushed back against your post by accusing them of ""gatekeeping."" What a load of crap."

and this, my good pals, is why HOAs are pointless busybody trash"

He will probably treat him the same way."

YTA and kinda weirdly controlling. It sounds like you have some sort of unresolved issues or resentment with your sister with the way such innocuous behavior is eliciting such a response

The discount is an employee benefit in the same way if you have a 401k match from an employer, she's not entitled to that money.  You agreed when signing the lease to pay ""x"" and the discounted rent goes to her as her employer is giving her the money.

EDIT: Also other things to consider, what if she is compensated less in pay due to a portion being allocated to her living expense?  Would you expect that money if you were living with somebody who had their living expense paid for by their employer because they had to move states?"

First of all, it sounds like a pretty typical registry. Most wedding gifts aren't cheap. I don't know what you were expecting, or on what basis.

But the reality of the situation (at least from the picture you've painted based on your original post and a response I've read) is that he would be more stable and happy staying with you.

Where I'd disagree with your wife is that you're enabling him; this doesn't sound like the kind of father that would ""step up if he had to."""

c6nfh5,"YTA: Almost ESH, but leaning more towards this one.

1) The ""married"" man was actually separated. He may legally have still been married, but they are no longer together and he's free to have relationships with anyone he wants.

2) Your sister was the one in a committed relationship and cheated on her husband with this person. She's far more guilty than her current husband is.

3) You're obviously allowed to choose who want to be around, but you are being incredibly hypocritical and judgmental. Your sister is far more at fault here than he is."
c6nuj6,YTA. Everything about her financial situation is irrelevant. You even said you were fiscally irresponsible while owing someone else money. You borrowed money from her and it was on you to pay her back. I have a feeling it turned into “I can’t pay you this month because of x reason” and she’s fed up.
c6o0n8,NTA- accidents happen
c6o25n,NTA.  First come first serve is the deal.
c6o2t1,"YTA - you seem more angry with your girlfriend for not reacting however you deem appropriate to her being harassed at work, than you are to the guy harassing her. That is some fucked up logic.

Looks like someone needs a crash course in workplace harassment and why the thousands and thousands of women who experience it every year don't report it, and why we have recent movements like ""Time's Up"" and ""Me Too"".

This is WAY MORE than an uncomfortable situation. If not handled correctly, this has the potential to ruin your girlfriend's career. She can make a complaint to HR sure, and I think most people would advocate for that. There is a very real concern there though that she could be fired for the next minor mistake she makes and blacklisted from her chosen profession in the community.

And if that doesn't happen, and she is able to keep her job and continue working, it is highly unlikely that this man will be fired. He will simply apologize and say he didn't realize he was being inappropriate and will never do it again. Then your girlfriend has a situation where she has to work with the guy who has been harassing her, and he knows that she tried to get him fired. If he is in a position of authority over her, he could make her work environment incredibly toxic without ever breaking any rules, essentially forcing her to either put up with it or quit.

And if her other colleagues hear that she tried to get him fired and believe him over her, which, history shows is pretty likely unfortunately, she ends up in an even worse position of a toxic environment and no allies to speak of.

And hey, so she has evidence of him drinking at work. You absolutely sure that she has solid, foolproof evidence? Like, a video recording of him admitting being intoxicated at work? Because anything less than that isn't going to go anywhere. He could say he had a bad reaction to some medication which made him woozy, dizzy, or slur his words. He could say that he just had a beer with lunch on one occasion with a client. He could say that he's an alcoholic which, depending on his profession, would legally prevent his company from firing him as long as he sought help and treatment for the condition.

There are so many, many, many reasons why a woman would not feel comfortable reporting her workplace harassment. Is it right? Absolutely not. But does it warrant your anger and accusing your girlfriend of lacking in self-respect? ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT.

Quite frankly, if your girlfriend posted here and asked for advice on this situation because her boyfriend was mad at her for not reporting harassment/abuse, we would be telling her to dump your ass immediately and get far, far away. I sincerely hope she finds this post and does just that.

Edit: typo

Editedit:  my username refers to the time I was fired and my boss said it was because there was ""too much estrogen in the office"" and he didn't ""want the eye candy around"" any longer. That was my first reddit post just last year. This shit happens all the time.

Editeditedit: apparently my post comes across as though I am advocating for women to keep their mouths shut and not report workplace harassment. Please know that that is absolutely not my position, and I personally think that harassment should be reported - but you have to be smart about it (get a written record of you stating your boundary, bring a trusted senior colleague or union rep to your meeting with HR, immediately ask HR for a gameplan as to how they intend to investigate and resolve the issue, and make it clear that you take this very seriously). With that being said, my post was written to highlight the very real and very common dangers that women face when they do report harassment. These reasons are why I will always support those that choose not to come forward or report their harassment/abuse, and why I think OP is an asshole for blaming and belittling his girlfriend."

* they could have a bone or muscle thing that stops them from being able to walk far distances
* there are wacky things like allergies to cold which are viable for handicapped parking (i've heard of these people needing to run from the handicapped spot to the indoors to forestall a skin reaction, which honestly looks pretty bad since most people assume the spots are for people with poor mobility)

c6pzm0,"YTA. These people literally just heard their family member is going to die, and you want them kicked out of the hospital? Have some compassion. This is not them hearing that they failed their math test and need to get over - someone is literally dying.

YTA big time."

c6q393,"NAH

You're not wrong for thinking it SUCKS but the nature of working the kind of job that doesn't have a set schedule is that yes, the manager can decide the schedule with as little notice as they like.

It sounds like you've had accommodations made for your FMLA-related appointments and leaves to the extent the company is required to accommodate that stuff, but not finding out far enough in advance that you're working is part, unfortunately, of working certain types of jobs."
c6q67k,"NAH your dad is perfectly right in thinking teens get regrettable tats and you have the right to acknowledge that but get a tat anyways, especially since this one is meaningful. I'd definitely do a lot of research on the artist because a cat *could* come off looking bad if not done right"

He’ll notice that and he’ll probably think it’s because he’s a step-grandson, which won’t help anybody."
c6r53l,"Tough one my friend.. I get where you're coming from but making shit up is still a bad idea.  Not exactly an asshole move but it's super likely to backfire on you and make you look like an asshole.  Also super likely to further reduce your odds of having a real experience.

c6rtvg,"NTA

i've done similar things bc being closer is awesome in those situations. The second I was in the way of someone I moved since i'm in the wrong. The escalation kind of demanded a stronger response. They clearly weren't going to listen to reason, and the fact that many cops showed up says they took it seriously as well"

c6rxbm,"Honestly, YTA, and so is your group.

You guys don’t sound like college age, this screams elementary mentality,"
c6ryfk,"NAH

They aren't wrong for swearing, and you aren't wrong for objecting if there are kids or just other people within earshot.

c6rzf6,"NTA.

You're under zero obligation to interact with him ,especially considering he seems to show no remorse. Your mom probably feels obligated to middle-man because no parent enjoys their children being isolated from each other.

c6sjl2,"Absolutely NTA. You have every right to refuse a vacation with your mother. Especially with a special needs child and her past of not raising children means you shouldn’t send them on a vacation with her solo. Additionally, you offered to go on a trip with just her and your family. That is more than enough to show your intentions.

The fact she jumped right to racism is ridiculous. Don’t feel like TA in anyway."

Besides, this grudge is 15 years old."
c6stis,"NTA

If it was mild. In that he wouldn't have problems from contact or an airborne reaction. I can't see any problem.

People get way too uppity about peanut allergies especially with schools. If he had a consumption only peanut allergy I don't see why you can't eat a peanut butter sandwich in the same room.

I'm allergic to mushrooms if ingested. I'm not going to stop you from having from having a mushroom burger in the same room as me. None of my business if you hate yourself."
c6sycm,"YTA.  Don't lie to your kid.   You deserve the fall out.

Just be honest and say that saving money is important and that your kid will have all the necessities he might not get everything he wants, and that's just normal."

c6t6di,NTA. Who wants to be woken up at 3am several nights a week?
c6t9kj,NTA. Some kids just don't get the point until you raise your voice because their parents have never enforced boundaries.
c6tf1u,NTA because of history. High school is only 4 years. How is she still able to get pregnant and not on birth control by now?
c6tiv2,"NTA.  Your weekends are not less important than hers just because you are child-free.  It's up to her to figure out how to deal with family events etc. on weekends, because she needs to work her share of weekend days.  If that means she has to miss some things, oh well.  And that applies during the school year too."
c6tuu7,NTA. Many people I know pay by room size.
c6u07s,NTA. These parents seem too overprotective.
c6u0e3,"Nah as long as it’s done tactfully. It’s not in what you ask for it’s how you ask for it. 

“Hey sister, I would love to help you and hear about what’s going on but could we maybe change how things work and keep meal times light hearted? I really want to enjoy my food and not be reminded of all the stress in the world - we can chat about heavier stuff right afterwards.”

If it’s the former, you’re a jerk - but since it seems to be the latter, you aren’t. You were right to be cautious. As a woman, I’m constantly aware of groups of men like this - I live in the midwest and sex trafficking is a big deal here, so I would definitely notice men doing things like this and be uncomfortable.
I’m gonna say NAH because they didn’t actually DO anything (lol) but if they had kidnapped you, they’d be the assholes. (And we wouldn’t be hearing from you anyway, so there is that.)

c6uj8h,"YTA - and what you’re doing isn’t even legal. Generally courts require consent for children over 12. Its his life. You can explain rationally why you want to do the adoption, but it’s ultimately his life. You also weren’t the only person traumatized by your late husband’s death. Pushing an adoption is incredibly insensitive to his loss. 

As the only surviving parent, you need a will and you can state who receives custody your children in that will. Your mom can fight it, but unless your new husband is somehow unfit, she will likely lose and waste a lot of her own money doing it."
c6uklp,"NTA, that is money you would be entitled to if you weren’t lesbian, and you should still be entitled to. They don’t get to pick and choose who their kids are and they’re major asses if they’re just going to treat you like you said they will. You have a right to that money, and they don’t have the right to control you. That being said you need to make sure you would be safe in this situation."

c6umxy,"NTA

She quoted you $35 so why did she make something that costs $150?"
c6uu9i,"NTA for wanting your money back. A small claims court judge would take your side.


NTA for not wanting the girlfriend to move in. Your landlord would probably be interested in knowing about her. Your lease most likely prohibits extra people moving in."
c6ux03,"Nta, but your friend sure is. I would tell him that you noticed he stopped replying. Then tell him that you're moving. I wouldn't suggest ghosting your friend like another poster suggested. Ghosting is childish and you shouldn't stoop that low."
c6v8ah,"First come, first serve implies actual use of the bed. There's no ticket system or reservations, only tired people that need to sleep. It's the same thing with buses and parking lots. NTA."
c6v8ls,"Tbh, I would have told her that if she wanted a house that costs out of range, she would have to make up the difference. So she’d be paying an extra $300+ a month. Just so she knew that the price range was something you could afford and you weren’t lowballing."
c6va6p,"Meh.  This is one of those things that has become one of those things that are fought and people point to as a trivial fight when there's actual real sexist battles.  I had an English professor that required us to contort the English language out of all shape because there was no gender-neutral singular pronoun twenty years ago and we couldn't use ""their"" because that wasn't grammatically correct either.  If I had to pick a battle between mild language sexism such as ""guys"" or being paid equally, I'd pick being paid equally.  Try ""y'all""  It's all purpose. Or start saying ""gals"" because that would be hilarious.   NTA really but think about how a group of guys would react if you called them gals."

If you make it totally clear that this thing has been a problem from day one and sell at deep discount with a buyer caution that’s fine but understand selling it voids the warranty for the person you sell it to so if you sell it without telling them it’s been an issue the company will not help the new owner. So you’ll be fucking them over which is what it sounds like you are planning to do because you put you are worried they will come after you if it becomes defective again which they wouldn’t have cause to do if they were warned and given a deep discount for.

c6w6e8,"NTA, you weren't listening to her in the first place and she was making a huge scene out of it. Second you were in a public space and she had no reasonable expectation of privacy so you could have been listening to her. I would have laughed off the ridiculousness of it too."

He’s 7. he’ll cry, he’ll get over it. he won’t do it again to you or anyone, and one day he will teach his kids to respect people’s dogs. you did him a favor."

This person isn't your friend, they're just a user who exists to drain all your time, money, and energy. They have no respect for you, and as long as you give them the attention they have a way back in. 

You talk about it on social media they can use that to get in with other people, get other people to talk to you for them, make it look like you're the asshole to someone, or even to get back in with you by using some sob story and, knowing you would have felt bad about it cause you're a normal person, shame you into forgiving them and moving on so they can use you more. 

Just cut them off (out of your life as much as possible) and be done. 100 euros is a cheap price to be rid of that trash."

I think it would be petty to complain when everything turned out fine and these people have such a tough job already."
c6x1cm,YWBTA if you cancelled based on that alone. Sounds like you two have some connection and if she has agreed to go on a date with you then what’s the problem? Her sexuality is only for her to decide and she has decided at the very least to go on a date with you! Go on the date see how it goes!

Turn your phone off and actively listen to the conversation. You might get to know your family on a deeper level."
c6x378,NTA. This person wasn’t respecting your boundaries at all. And he’s still not because he’s stalking you on social media. He’s also homophobic. You don’t need this person in your life and you don’t owe him more changes or an explanation.

Smoking may be bad for you and lead to health issues but so is a ton of other things - like overeating sugar etc.

Sure, express your concerns - but forcefully manipulating her and making her feel like utter shit - which probably just stresses her out and increases the urge to smoke more - is just rude and horrible behaviour - that is your mother. And I don’t really get how you’re comfortable with that.
Unless you treat your body like a temple, you can’t really point fingers so heavily.
It’s great you care about your mothers health but you really need to lay off, it’s not up to you what she does. I feel like more than anything you should be taking a supportive approach with helpful suggestions and maybe talking to her - emotional manipulation is kinda dark."

c6zjgo,"NTA.

The part where you said you convinced your friend make it a bit shaky, but your friend doesn't want to live with his parents, also he could still live home if you were the only reason to rent a flat.

c6zk8u,"NTA

That person doesn't know what ""opinion"" means.  Saying NTA is an opinion.  Saying standing will damage a 3 months legs is stating facts.  

There's is a couple of quotes that are relevant ""facts offered without evidence can be dismissed without evidence"" ; ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"".  When some rando contradicts what a doctor says, it's smart to ask ""where did you read / hear that?  Or did you just make that up?"""
c6zl0m,"Clearly NTA.

Your friends wife sounds like a piece of work. This is why my partner and I always try for our own room at least."
c6zpvd,"NTA-your gf sounds incredibly insecure. It’s not like you invited her on the trip, it’s ONE meal and not even out of your way."
c6zqbq,"NAH But just don't stare at people kissing, it makes them uncomfortable. Asshole is a strong word to use in this situation."
c6zrva,NTA. I get that he’s feeling slighted but with gaming friends it’s normal to just kind of fall off after a while.
c6zyct,"NTA, what the fuck? This girl sounds like a moron..."
c6zycz,"YTA. Your parents are right that you need to start earning your own money now. You don’t even seem to be taking into account that they foot the bills for your whole life right now and getting a job would be taking more responsibility for yourself.

As someone who has managed college interns, the ones who have never had a job before are the worst. You need to develop basic job skills before you’re going to be a decent intern, which is important to getting a decent job. Listen to your parents. You’ll still have plenty of time to do other stuff this summer."
c7008j,YTA. Why the fuck do you think the presence of your stepson would lead to conversations about how your ex emasculated you? If you love him ‘like a son’ then treat him like your son.

c70e0a,"NAH. (Unless he does get upset you stole his idea and then he’s TA.)

You both should choose your major and career  based on what you want to do. You shouldn’t do it because he’s doing it and you shouldn’t not do it because he’s doing it. 

It’s too important of a decision to make based on other people. Hopefully, your BF will support you doing what you are most interested in."
c70ebn,YTA. You started this because you got mad he opened a browser and not an app. And then you say he frequently does things in an unpractical way that takes longer. I think you are treating him horribly but won't admit it.
c70efz,NTA. A grown woman crying over something like that is ridiculous.
c70iam,"YTA - you shouldve made it crystal clear as to whether or not she was cool with it before you went in, and now you're walking around with the potential to severely embarrass her in any social setting by revealing it, accidentally or otherwise."

Btw, unless there is a special medical reason, the idea that you have to force yourself to drink loads of water [is a myth.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html) You get lots of your water through food, and drinking what you like when you like.

c71o74,"NTA - Because she had plans with you, broke them at the last second, and didn't seem to care at all.

c71v00,I’m gonna have to say ESH even though you’re a justified asshole here. Obviously she was wrong to try to deceive you but you could have easily had this discussion with her in private or addressed the parents as a whole but have the conversation pointed at EntitledMom. I think singling her out was unprofessional even though you were justified.
c71xje,"YTA - Big time. 

For one, accounting is a very lucrative field with a lot of job security and massive room for advancement. 

Secondly. you seem to think just attending a good uni gets you a high paying job. You don't even mention a program or field of study and just assume good school=high paying job right away.

Worst of all, you have just shown that you do not support your daughter in one of the first major adult decisions she's made. 

Your post comes off as incredibly condescending to anyone who goes the apprentice/trade route, or doesn't attend a prestigious university. 

Get over yourself and support your child."

Say that you will be there for her when she finally decides to leave her toxic boyfriend, but you will not stand as a witness to her abuse."
c729fh,Definitely NTA. What kind of boyfriend contacts an abusive parent without permission? They’re both responsible for their own choices and their choices are shitty ones. I’m glad you have continued no contact with them both.
c72auu,WTF did I just read ? You got conned into buying her groceries....what was her disability and why did she need you to do her shopping for her ? I'm so confused.

c72jb1,NTA Your mom needs to do a better job of teaching her and putting her in situations where everyone is safe.
c72mfl,"NTA.  You could probably train the cat not to do this but it would be a TON of work and take a very long time. He would be safe in the living room. I would suggest that you consider getting him a friend if you can afford to care for another cat. I have found that having two cats can cut down on nighttime behavior problems because it usually is about attention.  If that isn’t an option, maybe you could sleep on the couch occasionally just to keep the cat company, but I am not suggesting that you are obligated to do this or lose even more sleep.  It is just nice to cuddle with a cat now and the.   The second cat (carefully introduced) would be the best solution.  It helped lot when my cat howled every morning in the wee hours."
c72nql,NTA for expecting your parents to acknowledge your birthday.
c72tw7, NTA - I would have given him a lecture about asking first and how people steal the chairs all the time. But I probably wouldn't have kicked the old man off the chair.

This guy sounds like a toxic person. If I were you....I'd apologize and cancel on the paintball, and let my real friend know I'm no longer interested in hanging out with that guy.

&#x200B;

I'm poly. You let people know what the plans are and who is going to be there. If I'm on a date with someone (which traveling to see them would imply) I expect to know in advance if other partners are going to be there. You had every right to be disappointed and feel annoyed at not knowing the details of your trip. Her freak out? Is crazy to me. She should have known to tell you about her other partner being there. And your feelings about that are fine. I mean... I CAN understand being annoyed about finding out about a fwb/casual partner's feelings from a roommate instead of from them.  

&#x200B;

But if you aren't poly? And this isn't going to end with you dating her? Why are you doing this to yourself. Spending time with her, dating her.... all that would do in the long run is break your heart MORE. You aren't compatible. And she isn't good at having multiple relationships so even if you wanted to try, she would be the wrong person to try with."
c73h56,NAH. Seems you might benefit from therapy and possibly medication and your mom needs some sensitivity training.
c73hcd,NAH. It seems like you both have a system that works. Each job seems hard and I think it’s reasonable to ask that you get some alone time. She may be upset because it’s last minute. I would suggest maybe asking for a different day where she knows in advance.
c73miw,"NTA but it doesn’t really matter. She apparently understood it the other way, so she is going to perceive you as unreliable. Even though I don’t think you were wrong, it might be worthwhile to send an email saying sorry for the misunderstanding but you made plans after you thought she definitely did not need you."
c73ooh,"NTA. If you think it’s unsafe for the child, call. They’ll come and see if it is or not."

Your mom is overstepping and really not respecting your parenting, you, or your wishes.

Set boundaries and stand firm. Don't let her manipulate you, and no matter how hard it is, don't be passive on this. You need to have a confrontation and adult conversation regarding it. 

Because it will be small concessions until it's a shit show. Put a stop to this while you can."
c73uyw,"NTA. Your friend’s an idiot, this band would have pretty quickly figured out he isn’t a drummer."

&#x200B;

If she's upset you won't embrace god with her, that's her problem, not yours. You going or not going to church doesn't impact her ability to go and she can still pursue her beliefs on her own. If others don't support this fanaticism, that may even help show her how crazy these things are."

Not to mention that not disclosing the plot to him and just letting him be surprised by it while watching could have been severely triggering and re-traumatizing.

Edited to add: he may also have just seemed supportive at first because he was shocked and didn’t know how to react."
c748qh,"NTA. Your brother is a dick and your mom needs to stop like immediately. You really need to back you fiancé up in this. 

I’d have one talk with your mom where you tell her that your fiancé isn’t interested in being close friends with your brother, that everyone is happy this way, and that’s how it’s going to be. And then from then on whenever your mom starts harping... leave. End the conversation. Either she’ll learn, or you’ll get some peace by leaving."
c74a0y,"YTA - Kinda. They love you and want to buy you a gift for your birthday. I get that he doesn't need to be spending the money and the gift is ironic, I also totally relate to not wanting to get gifts.

c74q1y,NTA . You owe no one nothing. This is a hotel or corporate issue. That person could use earplugs but does not.
c74wgn,"NAH but you do sound like a dick.

You say you have no relationship, you're practically strangers, yet you sit there and make assumptions about him feeling inadequate.

Honestly he probably feels guilty that you two don't have much of a relationship, and he's trying to fix that. If you have no interest, that's fair enough, but no need to insult the guy in the process.

And may I remind you, the phone works both ways. There was absolutely nothing to stop you trying to forge some sort of relationship over the years yourself. It wasn't solely his responsibility to maintain contact and he isn't the only reason you guys don't have a bond. It's on you too."

Edit: just woken up to a pretty full inbox on a comment I typed out in two seconds. I didn’t mean to say that OP’s brothers care trumps OP’s happiness - just that, in this situation, it’s the thing to look at first to then figure out how to proceed.

It sounds super disrespectful to me, regardless of intention. Your comment was rude and you should probably have kept it to yourself. But I totally understand why you were offended on her behalf."
c761k6,"NTA - I read ALL your comments, and from what I understand, you want your daughter to inherit the money and house that were her mother's and yours, that your wife will not be left destitute or paying your debts, and that there is money and life insurance that she will get her share of.

Thankfully, he ended up OK but good god it was absolutely violating.

c771hi,"NTA. You’re allowed to move on, but you’re also allowed to not forgive them. You were young, and vulnerable, and looking for support, and they shut you out.

What do the dogs normally do when you're not home?  Her living there won't suddenly result in you not being there enough for them will it?  If so, it sounds like you're looking for a caretaker for your dogs.  Those people get paid for their effort.

YTA for this line:
>This is just not acceptable. How can you keep talking about living together in those circumstances? I called her out for just being irresponsible and I wouldn't trust her around my pets ever.

Do you not trust strangers to be around your pets?  

What makes her specifically dangerous for your pets, if you're still taking care of their needs on your own?"
c77njq,"YTA.. it might make you uncomfortable yes, but where I live in the south, fly catchers are a huge thing. She’s making an effort to get rid of them, she made plans and you’re making money. If the house isn’t totally decrepit it shouldn’t be a big deal. Just make money and get out of there."
c77otg,NTA someone needed to say something to him. Why don't they kick him out or make him get a job?
c77prx,NTA . Start eating frozen dinners for  with the excuse you don't have any extra money. Sounds like shes using you for free nice dinners. Relationship is 50/50.
c77r3c,"NAH and I'm surprised af I'm the first to say this.

You definitely aren't an asshole for not wanting to be in photos and making that known.

BUT

Your family are not assholes for taking pictures. This is what the other abbreviation implies. If you're not, they are, unless there are **No Assholes Here.**"
c77us4,"NAH. I can see where your family would be disappointed that you’re not going with them, but I can also see why you want to spend time with your girlfriend. You should, however, be able to do what you want to."
c77y30,"Oh my god NTA. Honestly, and I would usually hesitate to say this- dump him."
c77yq5,"YTA

You don't know the actual situation between your ex-coworker and the vendor she worked for and neither does your boss. It's entirely possible that there's something else going on or that she actually was paid and there was some kind of confusion. It's something that she should take up with the vendor and, if that doesn't bear fruit, an attorney. 

Your boss doesn't have any obligation to get involved, since she doesn't know how their payroll works, what's going on, etc. As she noted, that's a benefit of paying for contractors: you pay what you owe and they sort everything else out. The ex-coworker shouldn't have brought it up around your boss, since there's not actually anything she can or should do about it, beyond general complaining that is unlikely to help matters.

You were way out of line to argue about it in a group conversation with the boss and the ex-coworker both sitting there, since that puts your boss on the spot to commit to doing something she doesn't know if she should do or argue with you over whether it's her responsibility in front of the affected person. If you actually felt that way, you should have brought it to her in private. Instead, you made a ""moral stand"" about how your boss, who was sitting right there, had a moral obligation to fix a problem that you know next to nothing about. This is after your boss had already said that it wasn't her issue to solve, so you knew that it was going to cause trouble.

>I might have come as arrogant but it's just who I am and I can't stand people abusing their power just because my paycheck comes from them.

On top of being arrogant, it was also rude, inconsiderate of everyone else around, insulting to your boss, and just about the worst way to handle the situation if you actually wanted to help. Even agreeing with your boss would have been a better option at the time, since it's entirely possible to agree with her and also encourage her to talk to the vendor about it.

You have no reason at all to think that your boss was ""abusing her power,"" at least not from this exchange. Abusing her power would require that she do or say something wrong."
c782xj,"NTA. It's rude that he said that he was going to bring her without asking you whatsoever. When you talk to him next, just say ""Hey (friend), I was just thinking of my birthday being a friend reunion and just close people. I would prefer to just keep it to the people that I invite."""
c783it,"NTA

I have the same problem with one of my friends. I choose to ignore whatever they're saying. If they continue to be asshooes then you shouldn't be friends with them."
c783va,"NTA. It’s a fine line between being accepting of different abilities and some behaviors behind completely unacceptable, but the line does exist. I sincerely hope he doesn’t harm or bother her."
c7847t,NTA. Why is this happening to you?
c785d7,"NTA
You are not reliable for your sister, and you do not have to haul her around. If her friend wanted her to come, she would have asked. Your mom also seems overbearing."
c787l6,Noted. Definitely won't be doing this anymore.
c788go,"NTA, traveling is tough with one kid. I couldn’t imagine 5. It’s not fair that you have to be the one to always take the initiative.

However, maybe get input from your kids? If they really want to see their grandmom, maybe it’s worth doing it just for them if nothing else. Tough situation, and I wish you the best of luck."
c78ax4,NTA - your mom should not have delivered such difficult news in such an insensitive way. She could have handled it much better.
c78bhp,YTA. Leaked nudes is not a joke and she deserves to know this.
c78bhr,"YTA. He gave you a car, instead you sold it. 
He could of sold it himself and got some cash back. It just sounds like he was trying to be helpful and you took it for free cash instead of saying you didn't need it or asking first."
c78bkb,"YTA a lot of people say “love” it doesn’t mean they love or even like you. I work in retail, customers always say “thanks love” once I’m done ringing them up it’s just a way of referring to people."
c78bl3,NTA. i’d do the same. she’s been manipulating you for a while now.
c78e58,"NTA, if they made a deal they should stick to it."
c78gzv,"I’ve literally tried to put in my effort. I’ve texted all of them multiple times throughout the summer and get short responses or short conversations and which I get nothing in return. 

I don’t expect them to be one sided. I understand how relationships work I just want to make sure I’m not being paranoid"
c78jts,"NTA. Accepting food every time it is offered is a quick ticket to obeseville. 

The lady wasn't an asshole for asking you three times, she was just annoying... but she became the asshole when she freaked out at you."
c78lal,"INFO  So I don't think they should do this anyways, but from your first paragraph it sounds like maybe you are saying this kind of ribbing is how everyone treats each other but you are just not into it?"
c78ox4,"NTA. Honestly being unhygienic isn’t good for anyone, even if it IS her choice to be as such. As for the stepmother, any drug addict, alcoholic, etc. is toxic and shouldn’t be “allowed”. If that was my family I’d tell the daughter to take a damn shower and recommend the wife get help. Maybe that’s just me, but I feel your argument is justified here."
c78sx6,Info: what is that you do when you’re drunk that’s upsetting your friend?
c78trt,"As a mum NTA. That would be a red flag to me that I need to watch his interactions more closely. 
I have a 4 year old and he sure as hell knows not to do anything of the sorts, from worms to elephants they're all alive (also thank Octonauts for impressing that even more lol). 

My guess is that it's not a new thing and you bringing it up has made her realise that it's not a normal behaviour and now has to figure out what to do about it. 

Oh and there are professionals that work with children that young, hopefully it's that old cliche of ""it's a phase"" but you're NTA for bringing it up"
c78usu,"NTA

I promise his job description doesn't include judging or insulting the tenants."
c78v0i,YTA - 100%. She was crystal clear that she wasn’t interested. You both need to back the hell off.
c792sj,Lmfao. It’s not “inconsiderate” of your girlfriend to get mad at you for forgetting plans. YTA not for having conflicting feelings but that just from this post I can tell that you probably don’t treat your girlfriend the way she should be treated.
c793uz,"Yes. YTA. If you truly love someone, you're going to support them no matter how tough things get for them. Is he supposed to just not work so you can spend more time with him? Lots of relationships have to withstand hectic work schedules, sometimes one goes to college, kids, ect. All things that suck up time to the point where days and weeks bleed into each other. 

I currently work 70-80hr weeks. Yes, per week. If my SO was angry with me even though I was trying my best to spend what little time I had off with them, I'd be appalled."
c797gi,"Parent of a 7 year old here. They understand more than we think. You need to tell the truth and stop lying to your kids. The 17 year old needs to know the whole truth. Yesterday. 

ESH but only because you lied."
c799cl,YTA. Get one with two beds. Get real
c79f9b,NTA As an adult your passport is your property. Not sure what a legal opinion may be in regards to your sister but your mother is being a salty bitch & knows it.
c79jji,"NTA. He can go fuck himself. I learned a very interesting tid bit of advice recently, granted from a tv show but it still rings true. Humans CAN change, very few ever do."
c79mxq,"Bro, if you get upset at something so trivial then she's just going to break up with you for good. 

You can get mad, but if you attack her for it YTA. You're on a break. She probably didn't really care to get the package until she felt like it. 

Break up with her if that bothers you so much"
c79py7,"ESH. You're the landlord, it's your job to enforce the rules, and that's exactly what you did here. However, giving them 24 hours notice to move out is pretty harsh in any situation. Moving their stuff will take some time, and they may not have a place they can go to live. One week's notice would have been more appropriate."
c79up8,"NTA. As an American, his behavior wouldn't be tolerated here either.  

He sounds like an alcoholic who hates himself so tries to boost his own self-esteem through bragging.  It's sad."
c79zu7,"NTA

You were helping the person who needed the most help, and you can only do so much."
c7a11t,"YTA - you’re obviously a kid, kids have to do what their parents tell them.  Going out with your family to a place you don’t want to go is part and parcel of growing up I’m afraid.  Sounded like you acted bratty to me.  I also think you may be exaggerating the drive home, bringing past mistakes that aren’t connected with no context just reiterates this.  You’re trying to get a not guilty judgement but dragging this up.
Sorry but suck it up kiddo."
c7a60f,[deleted]
c7a82m,"YWBTA I think it just shows a level of respect to the house owners, even if they would never know.

Also you never know where people have cameras hidden lmao"
c7aazq,"NTA for wanting to do it, but you would be the asshole if you actually went through with it. It's not your dog, and even if he's not treating it properly, it's not being abused. The most you can (and should) do is to continue to spend time with the dog when you can, but obviously grad school has to come first."
c7ac4h,"If anyone is the asshole in this situation it is you. You made plans you couldn’t follow through on because you were disorganized and when you went to fix it instead of taking the method where only you are put out , you inconvenience two other people instead. 

I’d definitely lean YTA here."
c7ady0,"Yeah, ywbta. Let him do what he wants with his facial hair. Jesus."
c7aegl,NTA this stuff turns behavioural real quick.
c7alxm,"NTA. I can't stand parents who do this shit. You're 15, evil apples is fine. The fact that they have an app to track everything you download is over the top.

Also side note, what does the fact that they're Jehovah witnesses have to do with anything here?"
c7asih,"I think NTA because you begged for help, they didn't help you, and you were forced to help yourself."
c7atcl,"As long as you're upfront with them about it being a platonic co-parenting arrangement, NAH

If you pretend you love them or let them think it, YTA"
c7avu6,"Absolutely NTA. 

Could you get a joint account or a money box you could both put money in to and then use that?

If she's getting so defensive she may be having money troubles but telling you to pay because you're a man is outdated. 

Before anyone asks, I am female."
c7b2xd,"I would feel weird about randomly bringing up what my friends' exes are doing after they've broken up. Doing so out of the blue seems like it would *cause* extra drama, not prevent it. It's the new girlfriend's responsibility to do so, not OP's, imo, especially since the women in OP's story are supposedly good friends."
c7b4q3,Wrong post my dude
c7b8zy,"You wouldn't be TA, the job market is pretty dog-eat-dog.

&#x200B;

Could you contact the second company and explain your situation? If they'd decided not to take you on they should be able to tell you there and then so that you can accept the other job, and if they were swithering between you and another candidate maybe you telling them that you prefer them to another company you interviewed with would nudge their decision towards taking you on.

It's a crappy situation though, I've been in it myself. I had to contact the second company and straight up ask, and it worked out fine."
c7bfg0,"NTA but I really really wouldn't humiliate myself by begging for an invite from someone who has been crystal clear that you aren't wanted .

It seems she doesn't consider you a close friend.  My guess is you are convenient.

I would not be doing them pet sitting favours though.  They don't consider you friend enough to attend their party but they'll happily accept help.

That isn't a friend. It's a user."
c7bl0z,NTA. She really could've handled the whole situation differently. I think it's really messed up that she made you choose. I really don't see any reason that you need to rekindle any kind of relationship with her now that she's decided that she wants one.
c7bqlf,"NTA- your family isn't listening to you, and that sucks.  I am sorry that you are dealing with this, but as you explained it here, you made a fair request off them, and they can't respect that. They suck."
c7brua,"NTA, it’s okay to practice self care and set boundaries especially at this time. Most people with poor boundaries in their lives will lash out when you attempt to set healthy boundaries, and that’s okay too, you are only responsible for yourself."

c7c5jx,">it's not her thing

This shit makes me so mad. Your ""best friend"" is going to skip your birthday because she just can't stand to be around a TV playing a soccer game? She needs to grow up. NTA"
c7c6mc,"NTA, don't be friends who take your every action personally. This chick seems to think everything is about her."
c7c92r,"He’s not actually young for this type of panic, he’s old. Separation anxiety is a common occurrence for children 1-2 years old. At his age, he should be coming up on some desired independence. Just a little bit, like being able to play with legos in his own room for example. (You said 7 right?) 

NAH. You won’t be an asshole if you’re coming from a place of genuine concern, and if you broach the subject correctly. Just keep in mind though that no matter how you go about this, there is a good chance your sister will be offended and not listen to a word of it. She’s not necessarily an asshole for that either."
c7cdw3,"NAH, instead, have a discussion with your ex AND your son. Let your son have his say in how religious he wants to be growing up, and have his father hear him out. You would be TA if you took your ex money but don’t follow up with the kosher agreement."
c7ceui,YTA because I wish my family was that interesting.
c7chka,"NTA, this girl is clearly manipulative. I would recommend just ending this friendship completely and moving on unless you want to deal with more bullshit like this"
c7cw1j,"NTA. Your financé is well meaning, but he has no idea of the extent of what you dealt with. You are perfectly within the right to never speak with her again."
c7d35l,"Obvious NTA. I would talk to HR about the specific examples (dates, what was said, etc.) of the coworker bad mouthing you."
c7dd0p,"ESH. Your boyfriend shouldn't have blown off your plans the night before at the last minute to hang out with friends. And if he wanted to include his brother, he should have brought that up with you ahead of time, not when his brother was in the car with you.

However, getting mad because he's trying to take care of his brother when their father won't makes you suck too, in my opinion. The whole ""not my problem"" attitude comes off as cold and a little self centered. Their home life may not be your problem, but it is his, and instead of supporting him or understanding, you're treating caring for his family as the same as blowing you off for friends, and it's not."
c7dd4i,"ESH. It sounds like there were some really understandable misunderstandings but afterwards you both behaved badly.

Basically you miscommunicated by sending him a letter that didn't make it clear until the very last line that it wasnt to him. That's a reasonable mistake to make. He freaked out, thinking it was to him, also something I can see happening.

He then showed it to everyone, instead of asking you about it, which makes him TA. And you lashed out at him, which makes you TA.

You should apologize if you think he made a genuine mistake and wasn't trying to cause drama. But for detailed advice you need to post in an advice sub."
c7dh0d,"YTA, her hobby is college football and yours isn’t as much. She said she would check the schedule and you don’t know if you have a schedule conflict or not right now. Right now you’re picking a fight over a theoretical and maybe she doesn’t want to theoretically give up something important to her to visit your friends.

Also you’ve only been dating for 6 months, asking her to change to plans and prioritize your relationship over her hobby leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 6 home games in a season isn’t a lot really, people who play D&D or are part of guilds in World of Warcraft end up with bigger time commitments then that realistically.

And stop being petty, it doesn’t matter if your school won more, or you think she should prioritize your relationship over her hobby. This is who she had been for a decade or more and of that doesn’t fit with what you want in a relationship find someone else."
c7dj6s,"NTA, you're right that he's being flakey which is one thing, but he's also not acknowledging your (very valid) feelings because of his behaviour.

It might be well worth suggesting he sees a doctor, because he's showing some of the symptoms."

c7eu8u,"YTA, but only barely.  I mean...  It's your money you can do what you want with it.  But you also told your mom you would help her out.  Going back on that is a bit of a dick move.

c7ev2k,"NTA

Girlfriend sounds like hard work haha! I'd definitely take whichever shift you'd prefer, she can go back to sleep/stay asleep.  This is assuming that you are waking promptly to your alarm and leaving quietly.

If you have a hard time waking up, multiple snoozes, alarm blaring over and over, then I could see her point..."
c7evd1,NTA to be honest your girlfriend sounds really manipulative.
c7ezal,"NTA! never in a million years are you TA here, you wouldn't be even without your parents shitty behaviour.

c7fsmk,"NAH. Your wife is also going through the trauma of having a miscarriage and having a potential second child, only to lose it.  Your feelings on not wanting another child are valid but so are hers and it's not like she can do IVF without another participant.

I don't think she betrayed you"
c7ft94,"NTA. I hate forced sharing. The only time you are forced to share your stuff is before you turn 6. After that it’s totally fine in life not to let everyone on the planet touch your things. If some stranger asked to borrow your mom’s car she would say no. 

Playing with friends and sharing is one thing, but there’s no reason a stranger should be able to take off on a kid’s new bike."
c7fvas,"NTA. You're not obligated to take on the burden of fixing your community onto your back. That said, if you think you're going to be free from racism in Ireland I have some news for you..."
c7fzb5,NTA. He asked and you answered. You shouldn’t be obligated to have a total stranger sit with you when y’all are having a private conversation. The second guy is the real asshole here
c7fze8,"NAH, don't really know what else to say other than that. Seems you've handled it perfectly actually."
c7fzi7,"NTA.   They want more space they should pay the higher price.

c7g11d,"YTA. Your child broke something, you should at least split it. No one has constant eyes trained on their children. So don't make it out like the sitter wasn't providing adequate care."
c7g1in,"NAH, I totally see both sides of the argument. It's never a good thing to let your SO dictate who you're friends with. That being said Andy sounds like a moron and I understand why your BF doesn't even want you to be friends with someone like that. 

I suggest trying to have a real discussion about it, no yelling, and come to your own decision about your friendship with Andy. It would be a shame to lose multiple friends over one person so maybe talk to the group about excluding him due to his attitude/personality."
c7g3sh,"NTA - You're just (sadly) being realistic. You obviously don't want him to be the victim of a homophobic attack. I see it from a pragmatic perspective, but you also have to let him make the choice for himself ultimately, and support it."
c7g6hz,"YTA - Because you aren't just trying to help her get on her feet, you're hoping to help her get on your dick.

Seroously, let her go and find a girl who is into you. Helping her in an attempt to get her to fall for you is not a good move and it will end badly."
c7g6mt,"What? Is this a joke? NTA, he's a grown ass man and can assemble his own sandwich. Jeez what a child"
c7g6tn,"NTA. She should not use that word or that phrase. If she actually thinks it’s funny, then she’s just racist."
c7g76z,"NTA - And to be perfectly honest a parent constantly asking their child for money is just plain trashy. But... I would have my doubts that it would achieve much and I would be concerned that if you do say something it might get back to your daughter as well and they may keep any gifts of money secret from you. 

&#x200B;

I think you'd probably be better of focusing your efforts on helping your daughter work through her anxiety so she can be the one that ultimately stands up to him. If you do say something to your ex though make sure you discuss it with your daughter BEFORE speaking to him and that she supports you saying something."

c7gct4,"NTA.   You were a guest at that party just like Cindy’s parents were.  You had no obligation to walk around and ask if everyone had eaten before accepted the food that was offered to you. 
Cindy’s parents were extremely rude to act toward you the way they did when you were both guests at a party."
c7gf2z,Yes YTA part of being in a relationship is making sacrifices and in this case sucking it up and just hanging with her family. You know you can actually plan stuff with them to like say you plan to go watch a movie with them or go eat out or something

c7gl0s,"NTA, definitely report it. Do it anonymously. I don’t know if they can do much, but it would be better to put her on their radar than not

That’s concerning, to put it lightly

Also, if you’re still in school, report it to the university."
c7glc4,NTA. Not even a Christmas Day party and she wants to include people you don’t know into the gift draw? Also ptf sounds like an asshole in general.

c7hbet,"I’m going to say NAH just because you don’t really know his intentions which is really the only way to deal with passive aggressive people in my opinion. Make them say it out loud. Until then, I’d say just keep up with your schedule and now when you plan to. If he feels the need to spend his time picking up your dog’s poop and mowing your lawn, take it as some extra time. He’ll either get tired or eventually talk to you about it."
c7hbf8,"ESH, ya’ll need some family counseling. That said you’re right to be upset, but you’re not helping anything by making the situation more volatile. You’ll make a lot more progress with sugar instead of vinegar. That said, rarely can anyone talk someone out of a shitty relationship like your mom is falling into. I wish you luck."
c7he04,NTA. Past sexual history should stay in the past. It’s up to you to mention it. I didn’t tell any of my other previous girlfriends or my wife how I lost my virginity and they never cared. People place way too much value on a person’s sexual past sometimes.
c7hfmp,"NTA. Jesus that some narcissistic bullshit right there. You actually were super courteous letting him rest. Your dad and stepmom sound like a couple of self centered pricks.

c7hn46,"If the fault is with the curtains then NTA and you are not responsible for them. 
 
The problem is, it's hard to independently verify whether you used excessive force with the curtains or not. Should the owner just take your word for it that you aren't responsible? A tenant is likely to say that even if he yanked on the curtains really hard."

You might want to rethink her coming up for a week. After the birth."
c7hppe,NTA. You were provoked by his childish behaviour and should not feel bad for responding.
c7hpue,"NTA, but thank God I’m not 14 anymore. I don’t miss these situations."
c7huo3,NTA: There doesn't seem to be anything there that would make you an asshole. You're not obligated to live with your friend.
c7hv77,"YTA, you can afford it and your partner is requesting some help. I've had the same opinion as you in the past, but my partner pointed out that as a stay at home parent there is never a day off. Even when you're home, the kids are so used to asking for your partner that she won't get a proper break. 

She's not asked for a daily cleaner, just one every couple of weeks to help with the more intensive cleaning I imagine. Feel free to review it as the kids get older & easier to deal with but in my opinion you should give her the help she's requested"

c7i3gh,YTA since you won't even *try* to watch it.
c7i87d,"YTA if you keep texting her. It's actually really difficult and awkward to tell someone you're not into them, and I think she's done a good job of giving you a clear, polite answer.

You can’t help having ADHD. You can’t just stop having it. Your mom needs to be a bit more understanding, and there are things she can and should do here (like get your attention before she starts talking about important stuff) to help.

You, however, need to start taking responsibility for the way your ADHD affects everybody around you. You have meds, but you don’t like the side effects. It’s summer break - this is the perfect time to go back to the psychiatrist and see if there’s something you can change to make the side effects tolerable. You have all kinds of free time for therapy to learn ways to keep yourself from zoning out, or to minimize the amount of trouble your difficulty with executive functioning causes everybody around you.

You need to do this. Once you start driving, you *need* to be on your meds. There is a noticeable difference in my husband’s driving ability when his meds have worn off, and it’s not pretty. At some point, you’re going to move out of your parents’ house. You’ll need to be able to deal with everyday shit, or you’re going to crash and burn hard. Your mom loves you, and I don’t think you zoning out in the car is going to change that, but believe me when I say undertreated ADHD is going to put a strain on your romantic relationships in the future. 

If you’re in therapy, if you’ve tried all the different medication tweaks, then you’re in the clear - but you can still help yourself. Talk to your mom. “Mom, I don’t mean to ignore you, but it’s really hard for me to pay attention in the car. Can you please make sure I’m not zoned out before you try to talk to me about anything important?” would go a long way towards helping this whole situation."
c7idqy,Not trying to be an asshole myself but this sounds more like a validation post than a genuine question. From what you've written I can't see anything that would make you the asshole while this guy behaves worse than shit.
c7igj4,"NTA

Her intentions don’t sound good. It’s a joke because she doesn’t want to admit she was being rude"
c7iht7,"NTA

She's very niave, I am guessing this is cutco/vector Marketing becuase they blast recent grads with letters, emails, and get their friends to text them saying ""they heard nice things about you from X person"".

If it's Cutco I wouldn't bother getting involved, it tends to be the one kids get wise to faster than the others, becuase no one can try to claim that their knives make you skinny or cure cancer.

But absolutely do not go to any presentation or indulge the fantasy. Have you headed over to r/antimlm yet?"
c7iiuk,NTA if you are legitimately breaking up. YTA if you are 'breaking up' to get him to fight to get you back.

c7iqn2,"NTA and he certainly is...and clearly an idiot as well, but that’s a different sub : ) 
He’d have more money if he didn’t leave his stuff laying around creating hazards for other staff and the equipment. What kind of moron is moving around that haphazardly that he could drop his phone that close to heavy equipment. Sounds like he’s lucky that he’s only lost his phone and a few tools. If your boss or your boss’s insurance company was aware that, he’d likely get fired as a liability."
c7irya,NTA  he should have more respect and apologize.
c7iura,"NTA. Say it kindly. But yeah, not even mixing up your vacations... that’s an easy way to a monotonous and boring life. Vacations are supposed to be fun new experiences that you can’t get at home. Traveling, relaxing, sight seeing....

Maybe you can compromise and go to that beach every other year. And the opposite years come up with a different location."
c7iuxk,NTA wtf
c7iyj0,NTA it kind of seems like you need to look into a protective order

c7j8ls,NTA. You weren't to harsh. You just calmly told her the truth. She needs to grow up and take responsibility for her mistakes.
c7jdrs,"NTA

You're being responsible.  

My bet is they will soon start asking you for money, if they haven't already.  Consider options for becoming an independent adult."
c7jfwy,"NTA, at all. The fact YOU'RE included pushes it there for me, if your whole fam had just been guests I'd say ""just go, but don't kill yourself getting a great gift"". But this is a ridiculously strange omission. The fact both you and your daughter spoke to the bride means you're very reasonable. I'd be very uncomfortable in your position and would bow out. E: typo"
c7jh8y,"I don't even know where to begin on this one, but NTA. You are not obligated to look after your sister, your mom is the parent. 

Obviously not all human behavior is rooted in rationality, and I have no idea if Palm Beach is as dangerous as your mom thinks, but that kind of anxiety seems overboard."
c7jhyl,[deleted]
c7jmvj,"YTA,  but your wife even more. You even said you had to force her into the academic decathlon. If she wants to try athletics to get a break from the stress of studying, then you should 100 % support her. Just because she isn't athletic doesn't mean she wouldn't enjoy it."
c7jn9u,"NTA. You spoke up on behalf of a family that you care about, which includes your boyfriend.

You should expect her to be unpleasant at the party, but you can get around this by deflecting her criticism with a subject change. 

Example: “Oh, are you here to tell me how I’m screwing up my family again?”

“I’m sorry it’s been so long since we’ve seen each other. It was really nice of Grandparents to have us all over”

“Yeah? Well it’s your fault you never see me, after what you said!”

“Can I grab you a soda? I’m going to get one”

Basically just don’t let her bait you. Shift the convo or start talking to someone else. Eventually she will either give up or make enough of a scene that someone else shuts her down. 

(You’re a good girlfriend - most important is that your boyfriend gets to see his family and comes home ok)"

c7jwyh,YTA. It is littering. Just leave it for the person behind you?
c7jx1c,"ESH/NAH. This isn’t a healthy relationship, where you just sit there and your girlfriend puts the weight of all of her mental health and family situation onto you. It’s not going to work for either of you. She needs to see a mental health specialist and your relationship needs to be more balanced. I don’t blame you for getting overwhelmed and it doesn’t make you an asshole, but telling her that she’s responsible for her family situation is a bit of an asshole move. And she shouldn’t be dumping it on you that’s not your responsibility. Classic 17 yr olds am I rite"
c7k15g,"YTA( but you didn’t know), I’ve always tipped hair stylists, I think it’s pretty normal"
c7k3ys,"NTA. Your mom needs to stop keeping score of who gets called and accept that you have a different relationship with your stepfather that works out to a different volume of phone calls. She is totally out of bounds making a big deal out of this. If talking to her stresses you out, you need to set a boundary for this. Maybe your stepfather will have some good advice on how to handle her."
c7k478,"NTA - though I wouldn't consider you the asshole, I personally would have reminded him at least a day or so in advance that you were still coming out there. when you say ""weeks ago"", I assume it's a good enough time for someone to forget something like that. I would however consider your dad the asshole simply because of his reaction by not only blocking you, but by telling you he didn't want you to visit. I can understand his frustration, but his actions make him the asshole since he could have acted differently."
c7k5t7,"You don't have the photos so you can't be expected to give them to your MIL.  If the only issue was the you wanted to be respectful of the photographer, I'd say NTA.

c7kj1l,"YTA:

Saying ""say hello to my mother-in-law"" to a girl that you KNOW doesn't like you that way is extremely weird and just makes you sound overly desperate (and even a bit creepy). The girl responded in a way that I thought was reasonable, but you went and ignored her.

c7kn1d,"I guess that’s where I have difficulty. Like we don’t want to cut her out of our lives. Up until now we’ve had a good relationship. My nieces are great girls, and they’re the only family members on his side. His mom passed away about five years ago, which hit them both really hard. 

But I do know the second we give the hard “no it’s not going to happen” she’s going to go radio silent. And oh well, then it’s on her and we did what we could. 

And thank you. I dealt with the scariest situation I could imagine and it took a huge fucking toll on me. I never asked for a thing from her, just kept her updated. But all I ever heard from her was how it was affecting her when her brother almost died. There’s a lot of selfishness going on and I guess we just need to accept her for who she is and move on like he did with dad. Behavior is learned, after all."

c7kq5p,"NTA. I'm so sorry that you had to go through what you did. You have no obligation to have a relationship with anyone, relative or not. Relationships must be earned and too often the old mantra of ""family comes first"" is used to guilt people who were abused or neglected into keeping contact with people they'd rather not. Do what is right for you. Let go of your shitty past. Get better.   


Also, it sounds like seeking mental help last time was traumatic but please don't be put off from seeking it again. Psychologists and Psychiatrists are people too. And some people are shitty. But a good therapist might be able to really help you overcome past trauma."

c7l8z0,"NTA omg hun. Your counselor is a fucking moron. That's first and foremost. When a child comes to you and tells you their parents are abusing and neglecting them, the last thing you do is talk to the parents and tell them what was said. Your counselor should have called CPS.

It also recommended that, when dealing with adult children who were fiscally irresponsible, you place conditions on the money or give a ""reasonable"" (for you) amount that you can part with. 

I said ESH because your SD is expecting you to foot the bill for the wedding, because you agreed to it. You've waited until two weeks before the wedding to express malcontent.

c7mx72,"YTA, but a gentle one. Look, I think your parents have the right to set a boundary that you can't have romantic partners spend the night. You know they feel this way and you are lying to get what you want. You say nothing will happen, but hormones and teens being want they are, I have to wonder. You are also a teen, subverting rules is kind of your job, so I don't think you are an awful person, but you are in the wrong here."
c7myv4,"ESH - I think. This is a confusing story. Max seems to change gender, and the timeline is hard to understand. 

If Max has been your dog for three years, and you've been taking good care of him/her, that ought to include basic obedience training. It's also unclear how long your sister had Max before giving him/her up; after three years, that's really your dog. 

You and your sister seem to have an unnecessarily confrontational way of dealing with things: ""end of discussion"", ""wouldn't take no for an answer"". And poor Max is trapped in the middle."
c7n3rc,"NTA, but I'd say go to the kids' parents first (if you think that's a viable option). They may punish them, and pay for the damage. I'd hate to see a kid get on trouble with the law if the parents would do something about it.

It's 100% up to you how much shit you are willing to take from someone. You aren't obligated to do anything. It might be the kinder thing to do to shoot him a message explaining how you feel, but honestly that's more of an option to open a dialog that would potentially pull you back in again."

I mean everyone too. Your girlfriend has no business making comments about how you talk to YOUR parents. Your mom has the right to be angry because that shit isn’t cheap!

c7ple5,"According to Emily Post: ""If you are invited to the wedding ceremony itself, and not just a reception, you should send a gift, whether you will attend or not.""

In my opinion, NTA because if you weren't coming  to my wedding I wouldn't expect a gift. Modern etiquette has seen a shift from prior teachings. On the other hand, if you were close enough to be invited, it does seem like you would want to send them a gift to celebrate their marriage."

c7pvxd,NTA. How utterly unsanitary to use someone else's toothbrush to clean up her phlegm. And childish to do this out of spite. Have you brought up the respect issue with your roommate? They may not realise they're being disrespectful. If you have and they have made no effort to change then ESH but your girlfriend FAR more so. Unless the roommate is actively sneezing into your gf's mouth.
c7pwyl,"ESH

This is likely made up. However, she asked you to do something, you said you would, and then you didn't do it. That's pretty assholish. 

I don't see a teenager stating ""I had unprotected sex"". I don't see how he has a gf he could do that with if his mother is as controlling as you say."

c7qdi5,YTA. Just because. Control your temper dude.
c7qfo1,"NAH as long as you're going to keep it to yourself. I think, short of immediate family, it's pretty unfair to behave like you have a monopoly on certain names. There are only a finite number of names, so people are going to have the same name as your kid."
c7qp58,"hmmm NAH. It’s not weird to want your own, but she just wants to be an equal - if my partner got “priority” with an item it would feel REALLY uncomfortable for me to ask permission to play it or take it home. Can she afford one on her own though? Because if not her options here are slim, and I can see why she’d be frustrated."
c7qrxf,NTA. You were being polite. The son is likely a little embarrassed by his mother’s size and lashed out verbally because of his internal feelings.
c7r2nx,NTA. Kids are dumb. They need guidance. You’d be doing the lil’ fella a service.
c7r3x8,NTA - It depends on what you want. If you want your brother to have a relationship with your child then you need to invite him to the christening. Choosing to not invite him is just going to alienate him further from your family as a whole which is potentially the ammunition your brother's new GF needs to get him to cut ties with you all together.
c7r9em,"NAH. Retail/service jobs are often a bit thankless, so we don't know what kind of crap this woman deals with each day. Maybe yours was the 5000th receipt she picked up and threw away this week and she'd had it. I'd give her a pass and make sure you grab your receipt next time.

ETA: My guess is that taking the coffee and leaving the receipt potentially creates confusion over whether the coffee was made and picked up or not yet made. Very similar to a service bar ticket if you've ever been a server. You need to grab both your drink and your ticket so that the bartender knows the transaction is finished. NAH stands."

But it's largely irrelevant here, because it's not your job to provide for you mother."

c7st04,"NTA, but don't approach the boss with ""she's too dumb"".  Approach it from a safety and competence standpoint.  Reiterate the safety concerns, then mention coworker is unable to spell children's names correctly even with parents spelling letter by letter, and it's reflecting poorly on the daycare.  Leave any kind of personal feelings and disparaging remarks out of the conversation.  Keep it business and professional so it doesn't come back on you."

If it is possible you may want to ~~withdraw~~ recuse yourself from the process citing the conflict of interest. If you can do so and mention what the conflict is you may find that your coworkers will find her behavior disturbing too and won’t hire her for that reason.

Finally as a person in HR are you allowed to use information you know from outside the formal hiring process? That she pursued your fiancé knowing he was engaged says a lot about her character and what it says isn’t good. You obviously don’t want to hire someone whose behavior may create interpersonal problems with her coworkers. Perhaps you can just be open about that as being a reason for not hiring her.

Her brothers didn't go to the bachelor party to check up on him, it's normal for the bride and grooms family to attend eachothers parties. Honestly the fact that he was so concerned kinda tells me he wanted to do something he knew would be inappropriate and that's just fucked up.

Giving the bride a LIST of things she can't do is incredibly controlling. First, it tells her that he doesn't trust her. Second, it tells her that he didn't have as much fun on his bachelor as he wanted, because he couldn't act inappropriately and now he wants her to have less fun too. And third, if he actually is concerned about what she might get up to, he should have sat down with her and had a reasonable conversation about it. You know, like how husband and wife are supposed to do when they have a problem?

If he has a sister, aunt or mom who would be interested in attending her bachelorette he should definitely encourage them to go.

c813ga,"YTA.  You all but banged another girl in front of a girl that you know has feelings for you.  In what universe is that not a dick move?  ARE YOU MADE OF STONE, OP???

&#x200B;

Sure, you're not exclusive, you've been clear about your intentions... but just because everyone is tacitly aware you defecate from time to time does not give you the right to take a shit on the middle of the floor in front of them."
c81545,"NTA

You are absolutely 100% correct. And you are right to put your foot down. You did your colleagues a favour whether they realize it or not. 

This is how working for free starts..."
c815mv,YTA. God this is obnoxious.
c81c1e,"NAH. She’s a punk teenager. She has insecurities as well. Nothing wrong with you telling her that this is a trigger issue for you, and that you don’t feel comfortable discussing it.

Obviously her skin isn’t a big deal. But comparing pain is a loser’s game."

c81fv0,"NTA

I think It's awesome that you're trying to give the bride a good experience. Sounds like she's surrounded by muppets. 

I'd just tell them what you're gonna plan and give them a choice whether to attend or not. Just be wary that if nobody else attends it might upset the bride."
c81g4j,"YTA not for using an acronym but for saying

>""well at least she's almost as friendly as the people at TPAW.""

that to a server going out of their way to try to find something for your picky ass kid."
c81kbg,"NTA but let me give you a piece of advice: no matter what you do, something will happen and they will end up with hurt feelings.  Whether it's the dog getting out of the area you set up, or them trying to take the dog into the rest of your house because once they're there ""What's the big deal?"" and making it uncomfortable for you to say no, something will happen to make you regret this decision.

Tell them to leave their dog at home or board it somewhere.  Don't put yourself in this position."
c81l5t,NTA I can’t stand people not owning up to their shit and acting like victims.
c81lyb,"NTA. That’s really an extreme consequence for not buying the smoothie. They really should’ve informed you right away and banning you from the place is way too much. Honestly, I’d call their corporate office 🤷🏻‍♀️"

&#x200B;

This isn't a minor heath issue. YWBTA if you didn't cancel. First of all, you need to look after your health. It's more important than a vacation. Secondly, if the hole rips open and ruins your healing progress you may have to get treated for it which would ruin the beach vacation for everyone else."
c81mxx,"NTA your parents babying your brothers, especially the jobless one, is enough to make anyone angry. Of course, the chores should be dished out fairly. Are you female? If you are, your parents are clearly sexist and expect you to do the work whilst the ‘boys’ do nothing. That would make me want to move out."
c81njf,"Then NAH.  Here's what I would do if I were in your current situation: take the loss, give her the car and tell her it's hers free and clear - BUT she's going to have to pay for her own insurance.  Give her until the end of the month to make those arrangements and then drop her from your insurance at the beginning of August.  Then go buy a different car for yourself.

This is the only way you will ever be free from this jacked up arrangement without looking like an asshole.  If she balks, then tell her to agree to sell the car."
c81r8x,"NTA.  Your money, your controller.  You don't have to lend anything to anyone, not even your brother, and even less so when he doesn't take good care of it."

c81z0o,">Most days he’ll go to bed around 9/10am and sleep till about 8pm.

and that's a problem because?

you can't wake up before 10 am? but its somehow his fault even though he's the one with the schedule and you can paint and fix up the house whenever you want?


>I wouldn’t get off work until he already went to work and he would be asleep by the time I got up the next day.

so why don't you wake up at a more reasonable hour since you're the one with the freedom to in your schedule?

the entitlement..."
c8249y,"NTA - although that wasn’t necessarily your place to butt in, she needed to hear it from someone. Considering she was arguing with someone for over an hour after being told they could do nothing about, proves how little she cares about other people and how little she respects their time."
c826lk,"I would cancel the appt tbh. She overstepped her bounds, and ESPECIALLY if you think she should have ""spent more time as an apprentice,"" I wouldn't risk that. NTA"
c82a3b,"YTA if you know the dress code, flout it, and then instead of accepting the rules, try to discredit the idea of the dress code.

Sure, it's a dumb dress code.  But I think it's dumber to put your job at risk over nikes, and getting an attitude about it is just dumb gasoline on a dumb fire.

&#x200B;

I would change my opinion if this dress code was a surprise to you and this was the first time, but I imagine you would have said that."
c82ahj,NTA - I sounds like either he did it to spite you or he was cheating on you with her.

c82kmn,NTA.   He's gross. SHOWER SON
c82lox,"YTA 5:00 she calls. Meeting is at 6:30. You have 1.5 hour to try to talk to your boss about rescheduling/at least work something out. There was no attempt from your part to be there for her. I understand people saying ""does he have to sacrifice his career"" but I highly doubt this meeting is something thats going to land you a 6 figure bonus salary. Set your priorities straight man. 

However, my verdict comes from the experience of having a SO always put work ahead of our relationship so I might have a salty/bias attitude towards people like that. I'd react the same way as your girlfriend if my SO stayed overtime for 2.5 hours for a meeting when I'm going through a tough time without even attempting to reschedule"
c82pbk,YWBTA this is obviously a huge interest in your partners life. My partner talks about stuff I’m not interested in too but I love listening tot hem talk about something important to them. If you’re not interested in what your partner has to say why are you in a relationship with them.
c82pqs,YTA girl do you really want to get shot over this? Leave it alone your brother chose to buy it.
c82qtr,"NAH. Or ESH. It could go either way actually. She was entitled to her feelings when you were expecting your child, and you are entitled to your feelings now that she is expecting.  A little bit of empathy on both your parts would have gone a long way."
c82wa1,YTA. Your wife is right that you're trying to bury half your son's ethnicity.
c82wqm,"NAH, as long as you keep it cool and take whatever messages are sent to you. If she’s not down, respect it."

It’s anonymous so feel free to just play it off and be as shocked as they are. If you are concerned about your safety when you call say you are a neighbor, not the babysitter. Those kids need at least one person in their lives to do the right thing. Please call now."
c8347n,"NTA. If your experience with POTS is anything like mine, fainting is *always* a possibility. Not to mention the joint pain. You are fine, not all conditions are visible to the naked eye. Your reasons to sit are sound."

c836do,"YWBTA if your reason for not inviting him is *your* idea of why he wouldn’t like it, which is the direction you might be going in. If YOU have no reservations about YOURSELF, extend the invitation and let him decide."

If he doesn't shut up ASAP, he might get you insane. I literally have anger issues just because of my parents (I don't manifest them in public, but I get mad as fuck whenever my parents say one of those classy parents ""argument"" which makes 0 freaking sense)"

c83bhr,"ESH- he’s being a dead beat Dad and no role model... but as someone who’s been there and done that, the best thing I can tell my know 10 year old is that I never kept him out of her life. I have him every opportunity. 

Go to court and have an actual custody arrangement put in place so he doesn’t take you first and you end up being required by law to drop her off with him on weekends"
c83e31,"NTA

You can’t let your fiends messed up interpretations of her relationships dictate all of yours.

What she did was punish you for her insecurity. And that’s.. shitty"
c83g9n,"YTA if you ask her too move in with your folks. We as women don’t want to move in with your parents; we had a meeting, so don’t ask. You may ask if she’ll move to another apartment though."
c83hty,NTA- you have a legitimate condition and would it kill her to use chapstick?
c83j63,"YTA.  Ok, your mom has a LITTLE asshole responsibility here, but not enough to call her the asshole, or even ESH.  Only because there are lower pressure ways to introduce your kids and a love interest.  

I assume by your capable expression of the English language, you are at least in your teens, and your sister probably also.  You're not tiny children that need to be protected from some strange man when going to a crowded public place.  You'll be friggin fine.  Try to make a deal with your mom that if you and your sis don't get a good vibe from him, you can give her a signal and maybe change seats or something so you guys don't have to sit next to him.  But Jesus, have some compassion.  Your mom is trying to get back on the dating horse, which in no way easy or fun.  Dating sucks.  She's trying.  Give her a break.  Be supportive.  Hope that she's happy, and help that happen.  She loves you.  She wants the best for you.  Do the same for her, and do your best to enjoy the day.  

Hey, dude might be so eager to impress that you and sis might get some extra snacks or souvenirs (just don't ask, let him offer... maaaaybe mention something you might want offhand, ONCE, to see if he takes the bait... can't blame a kid for trying.)  And if it sucks a bit because he's a goober or a jerk, you still got to go to a game with your mom and sister, and you were there for your mom when she needed you.

Don't back out.  It isn't worth making your mom feel like you don't care about her.  Suck it up and enjoy the game. :)"
c83j8l,Absolutely NTA.  You deserve to feel comfortable at work just like anybody else. Your managers would be a good resource to go to!
c83ldj,NTA. And I really don’t like how he threw in a manipulative “I would do this for you”.
c83lpo,"I’m confused. You’re just visiting? If so, YTA. Who cares? When you’re sleeping, your eyes are shut."
c83mk4,NTA or NAH. Your teacher pushed a little hard and should have respected your boundary earlier but she was just trying to make sure the girl who wanted to go to prom and didn’t have anyone to go with had a nice time. Can’t really fault her for trying.
c83n6g,"I can’t imagine spending money like you’ve won the lottery when it’s the result of multiple people dying. Sickening. Have you consulted a lawyer? Maybe there could be a way to freeze these funds, or put is somewhere harder for them to access."

You’re two months out of a DUI and you’re drunk dude.

c83s9o,"NTA. You've given her plenty of politeness, and apparently it won't take."
c83ssb,"YTA

Running tests on your friends, even if well meaning, is typically an asshole move (referring to the “to see how they react” part).

If you recognize that they’re selfish people, distance yourself from them."
c83ui3,"NTA, you’re no longer married and he doesn’t get a say in your decisions any more."
c83vsw,"> The hilarious part of all of this? I have to routinely see him at least once a month or so until I move in December.

....we have vastly different definitions of the word ""hilarious"""
c83w12,"NTA

You're allowed to pick your own job, and they don't own you. If they want you to be working that's fine, but you don't have to work for them; especially if they don't take good care of their employees (walk outs etc shouldn't be necessary). 

Find a new job and quit. If they pressure you then you'll already have the new job to throw back at them."
c83wg5,"NTA And you have every right to stop sharing these items if they aren’t being respected. You’re right, quality kitchen appliance should easily last ten plus years, and it was very kind of you to share them in the first place. You deserve to have them replaced."

c841mq,"YTA if you don't explain it imo, be honest with the people you care about. 

&#x200B;

You can let your girlfriend know that Tom might be a bit of a handful beforehand and you can choose to have a talk to Tom about any troubling behavior that you think should be a reasonable boundary in front of your girlfriend. Give him an opportunity to show that he can take constructive criticism on board and develop his interaction skills. If you care about either or both of these people I suggest honesty and care, surely your girlfriend can make allowances for a good person who is just a bit awkward and Tom can figure out how to behave like a polite human for a few hours.

&#x200B;

It sounds to me that you've been making excuses for him for a long time and you've decided that you know best what he can handle/ not handle. I do not buy that a person could have been so cut off from women in their life they can't maintain even the barest limits of politeness, I find that disingenuous and instead believe that he simply doesn't bother to learn at this point, as you choose to stay friends with him despite that I'd recommend some honesty about why you won't introduce him if you decide not to."
c843c7,NTA. I would say that the 'friend' is TA for just leaving without a word.
c843e1,"NTA

But coke is really not as rare/crazy as TV makes it out to be, in my experience. I'd say your friend sucks for not picking you up at the airport and for sleeping all day on the first day of your visit but really not a big deal if she wants to do a couple lines in her own house"
c845ny,NTA. You're smart to not tell people you live alone and he never asked what your living arrangements were. He wasn't entitled to that information if you didn't feel safe giving it out regardless of how often you hung out. Men don't understand the things we have to do to keep ourselves safe.
