cbrnir,"NTA! been there, and it sucks! I hope the year only gets better here on out and that you find people who care for you as much as you do them. Hang in there and happy belated birthday from an internet stranger!!

Editing to add: did people call or your family explain why they didn't come wish you?  Do the people in your life make an effort on other special occasions/previous birthdays?"
cbrnuv,"NAH

If someone forgets something they should come back and get it. Would it have been nice of you to go? Or at least let her feel some sympathy that the situation was not ideal. Yes it would have. She probably feels like you really didn’t give a crap at the moment when you said your still sleeping plus it’s raining. But I don’t think anyone is an asshole here, however you probably could have been a little more tactful in your response."
cbrzov,"NAH. She’s trying to look out for you. She may have an insight to the group dynamic that you don’t. Take her concerns seriously, and do a deep dive into your feelings on the matter."
cbs00i,"NAH - You seriously have communication problems in your relationship, though.  Not once in your post did you mention an actual discussion with your fiance about the ring or how you really felt about it...

Just talk to him about it.  You love him, you love that he wants to make this big elaborate display for you, and because of that, you don't need the actual thing (that you never wanted anyways).  There are no assholes here, except for the fact that you guys seem to just not talk about anything.  TALK!"
cbs39x,YTA. The way you say it is extremely rude. Also it's a line. You can expect everyone to be a foot or more behind you.
cbs44v,"NTA. 

Re-read the terms of your lease. You may be in a position to report this to the landlord to get help in resolving the situation."
cbs5n2,"I delete my old comments for a reason my friend, I don’t like to be stalked 🌈 🌈 🌈"
cbs869,"I hate to say it, bc it sounds like this is something you really struggle with, but YTA.

I get that it’s hard to explain and maybe a little embarrassing, but I think you need to try given how severe it is. It’s affecting your behavior around others (never eating with them, asking people to move??), and by giving them no information you’re allowing their imagination to run rampant to fill in the blanks.

Most people will probably chalk it up to some idiosyncrasy of yours, but I’m sure some people will think you’re coming up with excuses to avoid seeing them. I could see this causing issues for self-conscious overweight friends or friends struggling with an eating disorder as well. It’s better to say something like “I’d love to see you, but I have a sensory disorder called misophonia which makes it really difficult to be around people when they’re eating. Could we meet for a a stroll around the park instead?”

Also, if you’re not already seeing a therapist, I strongly suggest you do so. It sounds like your misophonia is really affecting your life negatively, and maybe medication or coping mechanisms could help."
cbsbm7,"YTA: roleplaying is basically a creative exercise and creative writing and fluff is part of that. You can speed read it. If you want to change their writing style, become a mod and limit fluff... but you're not a mod, and the mods haven't intervened, so you should stfu."

cbsfst,"YTA

Your sister has a disorder and if you don't want to understand it, fine, but keep your stupid thoughts to yourself. If you ever have the misfortune of suffering a mental disorder, I only hope your family treats you better than you are treating your sister."
cbsfwk,"Your sister is an idiot, and the kids could stay but she needs to go now. Do not allow people to treat you like this!"
cbsk1j,"NTA, you need your sleep. She's being petty and selfish. 

Maybe talk to her about it if you haven't already. If she continues being annoyed about you going to sleep/not giving her a massage when you're tired then leave her because it's pretty clear that she's putting her priorities way ahead of yours right now."
cbsk1n,"NTA, she's a 30 year old, hypocritical woman-child, you even apologised.

&#x200B;

A classic example of someone that can give it but can't take it."
cbskv0,"NTA. You had valid reasons to leave. That being said, find out what kind of reference they’d give."
cbsljj,">D shouldnt be grouped in with that.

Yes he should. Your friend is homophobic, and you are saying thats ok with you because you benefit from his kindness. Telling people that loving who they love is a sin is extremely unkind and extremely homophobic. And people get away with that because people like you let them."
cbsn3q,NAH - it's understandable that you're uncomfortable but she can be naked on her property all she wants tbh...and that's probably what she'll tell you if you bring it up to her
cbson3,"Ha, I like this one. Interesting question. 
 
If I think about it on the level of the physical object, if it's really as good as new, then it shouldn't matter. However, I doubt that reading it does not affect it in some way, loosening the binding, etc. 
 
But more than that it seems like there is something conceptually wrong with this. As a gift you are getting it for your friend. Once you buy it, it's designated for him and it's weird for you to use it first. Think of it this way: are you comfortable telling him that you read it before giving it to him? If yes, then nobody is an asshole. If no, then there's a reason why, and you're also kind of being dishonest by not telling him, so in that case YTA. You're presenting it as new but it's actually slightly used. 
 
Wouldn't it be better to ask him, when you're done reading it, can I read it too?"
cbsrdz,"NTA, it's better for you if you distance yourself from these toxic behaviors.

You shouldn't help people for the sake of getting a return, and them using help given as a leverage against you is downright scummy."
cbsu49,"INFO—So he is definitely TA, because regardless of what you did wrong, the remedy isn't to throw your crap off the bench and take it. Not least because there are roided people in gyms, possibly including him, and that could start a fight.

As for whether you're TA too, it comes down to whether you were you taking too long between sets like he claimed. Depending on what kind of work you're doing, normal rests range from maybe 1 to 3.5 mins, and obviously you're allowed to talk during them, and I'd give wiggle room because it's not effing brain surgery. So were you taking more or less than 5 min between sets?"
cbsudd,"You gave him all the physical stuff he needed but not what he needed most: emotional support.  
  
I get that you’re an introvert and rightfully kinda grossed out by your cousin, but rejecting his desire for friendship must have hurt. How many adult friends do you know that talk 24/7? You could have accepted his offer of friendship but firmly set the boundary that you were done giving him material or monetary items. He could call you for a pick-me-up or advice but not for money and a couch.  
  
What he needs is someone rooting for him because he’s not rooting for himself and it seems like most of the other people in his life have also given up on him or just failed him altogether. You obviously care and want to help your cousin or you wouldn’t have come this far. Spare some kind words and maybe listen with patience over coffee. Maybe that’ll be the encouragement he needs to achieve level 1 adulting."
cbszxp,[deleted]
cbt0km,"YTA, you're either the narcissist mother in law that nightmares are made of, or a total shitposter. 

I think you shouldn't go to their wedding.... because you don't seem capable of hiding your destestation of the person your son loves, or ceasing to make demands only motivated by your own selfish interests. 

They'll have a better wedding without you."
cbt15f,"NTA. The group excommunicated you and made a dick move making your BF choose between you and them. They gave the ultimatum, and your BF chose to go with the side that isn't giving the ultimatum, which is usually a good idea."
cbt3il,NTA fuck pyramid schemes and fuck that dude for using his gym as basically a recruitment center for one. You have more patience than I do. I would have lost it being constantly approached by other gym members for that shit.
cbt67f,YTA. If it was friendly and social you wouldn't have waited until he left to mock him. That woman was just trying to stand up for him and you didn't need to be rude
cbt6xc,"NTA.  A lack of planning on her part isn’t your emergency.  While she is your mom, $2k is a a significant chunk of money when you have other financial responsibilities."
cbtb53,"NTA. You're an adult. If you don't want to speak to him, don't. That is your choice and you absolutely do not have to feel guilty about it."
cbtdpa,YTA. This just gonna be Scott's Totts all over again.
cbtf2i,"NTA. Continue on with going to a solicitor. 

Also, unless you have children (which it appears that you don't), there's really no reason why you must have any sort of relationship with your ex."
cbti6o,"NTA what the fuck.

He can pay for the animal control or the electricity bill."
cbtjls,"YTA, the real victims here are not your ex-wife, or you, but your kids. This shit can really fuck up their lives. From what you told right here, right now, you didn;t consider their lives."
cbtjmo,[deleted]
cbtmds,"NTA

Expecting everyone to pay to go to their wedding and then *expecting* gifts too? 
Personally I’d still get them a small gift but wouldn’t be anything major, you’ve had to pay €1500 euros just to attend their wedding."
cbtmhp,"NTA, your friend was a doughebag and was hellbent on you trying the local cuisine. You probably should have flagged the waiter if your friend was ignoring you, though."
cbtu5a,ESH - You're trying to make out that he is the one who is solely to blame for your relationship not improving but from the subtext it is quite obvious that you are equally to blame. He's 15 and a moody teenager whilst you are a 20 year old adult. Be better.
cbtvnz,"NAH. 

You're not the asshole for wanting to have an actual conversation with your girlfriend. It isn't fun to sit and listen to someone ranting, especially when it's about something that isn't directly connected to you. It's nice of you to put up with it. 

However, I don't think your girlfriend is the asshole either. She seems like she's in a bad place right now, and ranting might make her feel better. Talking to you seems to be the way she's able to cope with everything, which says a lot about how she sees you, she clearly trusts you and finds you comforting. 

But you're right, a relationship should be give and take, and it isn't fair for you to constantly be the one giving. Perhaps you should kindly suggest that your girlfriend brings up being spaced out to her specialist, they might be able to help her."
cbtx8k,"ESH 

(Partly because...paragraphs... ever heard of them??)

But not to a crazy degree. 

Look, as you get older and people couple up, you’ll spend less time with friends. Having been the guy in this exact situation I can tell you best jealous “best” friends are like relationship kryptonite. 

Your mates aren’t supposed to be there to argue with, nor are they supposed to occupy every waking second of your existence. 

A good friend would’ve understood she’s in the throws of young love, and he’ll take up some of your time together... this is normal. 

BUT the way she reacted is wayyyyy out of proportion in reaction to someone simply worried they were losing a friend. 

It’s good that you branched our and met new friends, it’s really important to not simply rely on a few “best” friends. And of course, you need to be comfortable in and with yourself."
cbu3tk,"NTA

No idea how you could be the arsehole here. You’re probably just venting, but this feels a bit like a validation post.

It’s clearly ridiculous to marry someone after knowing them for 3 months. Giving your kids 3 days notice is insulting at best."
cbuapt,"NTA. Your security deposit probably covers your August rent, right? That's what security deposits are for. They will have a month paid for with no one living there. 

I'd also call the cops about the car once I've moved out. Seems like they need to learn a lesson. Having dodgy people around your property day and night without warning seems sketchy at best, dangerous at worst. You need to make sure you feel safe in the place you live."
cbuby8,"Info: Does he harass anyone/you? Is there camera recordings that prove that he is doing something there? I mean, he may just be hanging around/enjoying the air con (I do that too)."
cbucdl,"NAH they asked for an honest answer.

Although totally weird asking all their friends like that one by one!"
cbuce2,"NTA, this clearly wasn’t a friendship; sounds like she was just using you to get school work done and didn’t like it when you called her out on it."
cbuffm,"NTA and personally I wouldn't accept a friend telling me ""I'm wasting my 20s by not going clubbing"". The reasons don't even matter. If you don't like clubbing, you don't have to. It's not a requisite in life. Period."
cbukxs,"NTA but that doesn't mean it's going to go over well, tbh. If I were in the situation I'd probably just steer hard into the ""We don't want a roommate"" argument I think because that makes it less about her specifically and more about just wanting your own place with your partner. But of course if _do_ end up getting a roommate down the road it'll suck."
cbunse,"NTA, the dog's owners are clearly the assholes. The poor thing sounds bored & lonely & your life should not have to be to the soundtrack of incessant barking!"
cbuosk,"NTA, it’s ridiculous to ask someone to spend three days in a house with no wifi."
cbuuo6,"NTA - Being old doesn't absolve you from having to learn and change with the times. If she's anything like my grandparents (I'm in an eerily identical situation) her comments probably would have also been distasteful 10 or 20 years ago, so there's really no excuse."
cbuus5,Why would offering her help make you an a-hole? Just go for it and feel it out when she responds. Clearly you WNBTA.
cbuxk4,NAH. It makes sense that you’d feel excluded but friend groups don’t have to do everything together - especially when you’ve admitted you’re not especially tight with these guys
cbv46i,"NTA but do you really need your husband to decide whether you should say hello to your in-laws or not?

FTR I don't think it was an asshole move, it was just a quick stop and you did say hi to your FIL, but justifying it with ""that's what my husband told me to do!"" is a bit lame."
cbv55t,"NTA, but I'd try to find another job.  Also, I'd try to speak with him again, explaining the situation as you described it.  Lastly, I'd start emailing him at 1 AM his time and when he brings up you not responding simply tell him that he does the same"
cbv6l8,"NTA. 

>You ""took her out of state last year for her birthday!”  

Your mother is asking for one day a year and that's too much for her?"
cbv8na,"NTA, but I hope you got it in writing, because it seems like he doesn't want to pay"
cbvcdo,NTA. Everyone and anyone is allowed time away from their partners. Can't imagine many others would say otherwise.
cbvczp,"NTA

I've seen a lot of half and half hair recently. Why does she give a shit? She didn't invent the hairstyle."
cbvdv0,"YTA Bumble is not the right platform for that kind of joke. And she's right- that kind of ""just joking!"" overt sexual comment is /so/ boring and pedestrian. No one believes it was just a joke, it's always obvious that you're throwing bait to see if she'll be into your sleaze. You're just lucky you didn't end up on r/oopsdidntmeanto"
cbve3i,"You're definitely nta. She was the asshole for stepping over your boundaries and thinking her shit was better. You had every right to make her go through her garbage to get your kiddo's toy.

I have a feeling you need r/JUSTNOMIL in your life right now."

You’re wasting your breathe and are going to be even more upset when nothing happens"
cbvjcs,"NTA,just because youve fallen into hard times does not give your family carte blanch to abuse and extort money from you.Walk away and put them on very low contact for a long time"
cbvl3a,"ESH. this isn't about the dishes. It's about the fact that you do everything and it's been eating at you and your mad that the only thing you require him to do he didn't.

But that means you need to divide the labor more equally so you don't feel this way"
cbvmh3,"NAH - he’s obviously been through a lot and finds solace in gaming - you’re understandably concerned for his wellbeing and helping him explore new activities won’t cure him but could help, but your approach is important - gentle encouragement over coercion and nagging would definitely be a good way forward. let him know you’re there for him and support him fully, and maybe try and present some activities outside of gaming you could try together, baby steps, good luck!"
cbvqa9,"NAH. He shouldn’t be playing his music out loud in the workspace unless everyone agrees that it’s okay. You think it’s not okay, therefore, it’s not okay. But he didn’t do anything assholish."
cbvsfl,"NTA - your wedding, you invite who you want to invite"
cbvtyw,It sounds like you already know who the asshole is. NTA
cbvuoj,"YTA - there was no reason to mention you were ovulating, you could have just as easily left that out or commiserated with her. The fact that she has been trying to conceive for 2 years with no luck is undoubtedly very painful for her, and it was an insensitive comment for you to make."
cbvxdm,"YTA. He plays with those other guys knowing they are assholes. But when his actual friend joins in on the torment, he took it personally. Imagine if he expected the bullies to be mean to him and then you go over to their side as well and be mean to him. It's more of a personal attack coming from you."
cbw1ev,NTA. Tell him to get an Uber or a taxi. Or call for a ride.   Or drive himself separately if he thinks he will want to leave early.
cbw1uj,"INFO

Does your wife get to go out for time away from the kids/house?

How often do you want to do karaoke?

ETA: Thanks.

You're not doing anything inappropriate, she's getting time to herself, and you're not going out excessively. It sounds like she doesn't trust you. But her insecurities shouldn't keep you from doing something you enjoy. NTA."
cbw79v,NAH if you're discreet.  I'm sure you're thinking about this way more than they are
cbwal8,"Honestly, I think YTA in this one.

Your wife gave the camera to you, meaning it was your responsibility for the entire trip. There was no reason to pass off something that you were responsible for to your friend. Why couldn't you have given one of your other bags to him instead?

Like, normally I would say the the person who lost it should accept responsibility. But it seems as if you uncaringly passed it off to your friend (who also had his own shit to worry about) in a crowded airport instead of guarding your wife's property carefully. That makes you more of the asshole."
cbwgbt,YTA. You're not a minority and the mentorship is for a minority.
cbwh4m,"Listen here dawg.

cbwvy6,"NTA - you say you're focusing on your mental health by stepping away from things that are bogging you down.

Then she decides to guilt you for cutting her out when you need self care.

How unaware can she be."
cbwz0x,"gonna have to say NTA, frankly it should be illegal for parents to give over so much data on their kids to governments and mega corps in the pursuit of attention for themselves."
cbwz2r,"NAH
It is called free market, it's not your job to make sure she gets the best deal but hers."
cbx016,"NTA. It is very weird and a sign that she's either a predator, or hasn't matured herself. Neither is a good quality."
cbx1m6,"NTA what the fuck. They sound like white people that don’t know what they’re talking about. 


I’d suggest just doing a little research into Japanese style tattooing, as there’s some “rules” as to how a koi tattoo should face and be placed, etc. But other than that, tattooing doesn’t play those games. You’re good."
cbx20x,NTA. Seems like a validation post
cbx249,"YTA I love me a good steak, but properly seasoned and cooked tofu is tasty too. If your sister wants to eat it too ask your parents to buy more or buy your own. That was nice of her to ask before helping herself."
cbx2an,"I'm gonna say NTA, because they hired you and paid you and that's how it works. However, I do think you should contact the church and verify that it was deliberate to give you $200. If it was, nice! If not, you should give $100 back."
cbx576,"I’ve been your friend. The best friend I had was one who made it clear she knew what the real story was, but that she would be there for me regardless. An abused wants to isolate and manipulate, and while you are trying to help your friend you are also playing into her hand.  Ideally you should make it clear how you feel to him in a way that won’t be so “I told you so” later on.  You want to keep the relationship open enough that when there is a bad day, he’ll feel safe to come and talk to you. As things escalate, he will need that friend he can be honest with.  It seems like this is what you’ve tried to do. 

You aren’t the asshole for not wanting to enable or ignore what is happening. It isn’t the best way to help your friend though.  You can’t force him to make the decision to break up.  That said, if she is  toxic, you also have no obligation to invite her to YOUR events. You can’t put your friend in the middle of a tug of war though. 

NTA-  it’s a shitty situation to be in for everyone. Jane is the only real asshole."
cbxd53,"NTA, but it really doesn't matter. Submit a letter of resignation that says something like the situation may have not been handled properly, but management's refusal to step in while several employees were being harassed lead to your actions, and you would rather leave the job than work for people who don't value their employees.

I firmly believe in picking your hill to die on. I have done it at several jobs. If you have been looking for a reason to leave, take this opportunity. If you like the job, or don't know how quickly you can find new employment, sign the paper."
cbxg60,NTA - A toxic family member is still toxic and if not talking to her is important to your wellbeing then there's nothing wrong with it.
cbxhmp,"YTA - If she is only wanting to talk to you once or twice a week, do it. Seriously, every opportunity you had to talk to her that you rejected you will regret when she dies. 

Talking to her once a week is reasonable. Maybe tell her you love talking to her but your commitments have limited your time so you can only talk once a week."
cbxhzt,"YTA. Putting any type of porn in a classroom setting as a prank is an asshole thing to do (and illegal in some states). You're covering up the asshole, therefore you're the asshole. If snitching is not cool what he did is 1000x worse."

cby792,"NTA. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion. Your kid, your rules."
cby8sh,"NTA. I don't want to be around that crap, either. And you seem to be handling it well. You're not *attacking* them for watching it, just excusing yourself from it & them. And if you're going to join your dad, I think it's reasonable to put on something you can both agree with."
cby8tc,"YTA. As an adult you need to know how to bring up frustrations with someone and it's not by rudely cutting them off or embarrassing them in front of another person.
You could've easily handled this by telling her in private that you find her stories stressful or you'd rather talk more about non work related topics. Instead you decided that embarrassing her was better than dealing with the awkwardness of initiating that conversation.

cbyvav,"YTA already for judging your friend so harshly for how she dresses in private or on vacation.  Your parents are also assholes for calling her ""low hanger"" behind her back.  Talk about classless behavior.

Anyone who has such strong negative feelings toward children and toward parenting as you do will inevitably end up miserable with children, and honestly likely will do an awful job parenting them.

cbzt2p,"NAH I could go between this and him being TA, if he's trying to get this resolved, but it's weighing heavily on him mentally then him venting about it is understandable. Sometimes friends need more support than other times and as friends that's what we do, but if it's negatively effecting you that can't be accepted either.

I'd tell him that him constantly using you as his therapist is actually bringing you down mentally as well, and figure out a way to maintain the friendship without being a crutch for him.

Your family members are upset because they liked things the way they were.

Ok yeah, I know that sounds horrible. And I feel bad, for not feeling bad at all about this. My grandpa (dad's father) hasn't spoken to me or my siblings in over 10 years. We had a somewhat good relationship when we were kids, we spent some time at his house and made some memories but after my dad passed away when I was young, my grandpa completely stopped talking to me and my younger siblings. He hasn't wished us a happy birthday, called to ask how we are or went to any of our graduations. He speaks to his other grandkids however, and my family always tries to push me and my siblings to reach out to him because he's 'too stubborn'. After my dad died it seemed like he just came up with excuses as to why he couldn't be around us, but we were just little kids. One time he even told my grieving mother who was alone and needed a break from us that he ""wasn't going to babysit her kids"". My mom told us today that he is apparently dying of cancer, he's 90 by the way, and honestly none of us really care. Is that heartless? The way I look at it, even on his deathbed he doesn't feel like he misses his grandchildren and is too ""stubborn"" to make amends. What do you guys think?

Depending on your age, $20,000 actually might not be all that much to have saved. What were your plans if it took longer than expected for you to find another job? Did you pay off absolutely all of your debts before taking this break? How would this affect any long-term plans you might have, like saving up for a house? If I was envisioning building a future with somebody, and they didn't have very good answers to all of these questions, I would be concerned about their judgment and might be rethinking if I would feel comfortable possibly combining finances with them in the future.

I'm going to propose a different option here than anyone being an asshole.

Your wife has a legitimate illness that explains her situation. But massage therapists also have a right to be informed if someone they are going to be touching with their bare hands has a skin condition that might cause issues for them. And those issues might include a body odor that is unpleasant while the therapist is performing his or her duties.

The therapist probably did not handle it well but it's hard to know given that your wife refuses to tell you exactly what was said. That said, your wife had an obligation to inform the clinic or the Massage Company or whoever that she has a skin condition and what the ramifications are before she just shows up and expects a therapist to work on her. I understand that it's probably uncomfortable and embarrassing for her but if this is a lifelong condition and if she expects to be treated by estheticians and therapists, it's something that she needs to take into consideration and learn how to deal with.

So I think there's an equal amount of fault here to go around and I'm not sure there's enough information to judge if anyone is an asshole or not."

On the flip though, you don't know why the dog is kept in the crate. It might have separation anxiety and gets incredibly upset (i.e chews up furniture) if allowed to roam freely when left alone. Maybe the owner is afraid the dog will run out the door when they get home. But you don't know. So to not follow the owners instructions wasn't a good idea.

cc441s,"NTA - as a female I know the exact feeling you’re describing. Sounds like you haven’t done anything disrespectful to him, I don’t think it’s a problem to avoid someone. Especially if they’re giving you weird vibes while you’re at work."
cc44eh,"NTA. The dentist should understand the situation and that it’s out of your hands. If she put something false in the review, the dentist should have his attorney shoot over a C&D letter. That usually gets shit removed."
cc467r,"NTA, a dog owner should ALWAYS have a leash no matter what. I suppose this is more of not your business, but you're not an asshole for telling her to look after her dog"
cc47dt,NTA. This might be overly pessimistic but sounds like a ticking time bomb if they move in.
cc492l,NTA- your wife needs to have boundaries with her parents. They shouldn’t have so much power in your relationship
cc4bp0,"NTA. You should just tell Jon you don't want to hang out with his girlfriend. Don't make it into an issue bigger than it needs to be. Just say, ""Hey, I heard she's coming on the trip. As much as I like hanging out with you and everyone else, I don't get along with her so I'd like to avoid her. I hope you don't take it personal if we don't spend much time together."""

cc4bzu,"NTA. First of all, you’re the one paying all rent, utilities, groceries, etc. so it will cost you more if he stays with you. Second, he seems very controlling for having never met your sister. Though they have known each other for several years, I would still be uncomfortable letting someone stay in my home who I (or my roommate) had never even met."
cc4cuj,"YTA First let me mention that paying ivy school prices to become a writer where he likely won’t find a job or underpaid if he does is stupid. It’s very competitive most writers do not succeed. 

Split the money and have your grandson choose a less expensive school. Like someone said you just told your granddaughter she isn’t worth as much as your grandson. Even fixing it now you likely put a chink in your relationship that won’t go away."
cc4f0z,[deleted]
cc4f4h,"NTA.

The point of a funeral is to say goodbye and to reminisce about the deceased. If the person lived a full, long life, there is nothing wrong with a few jokes, as long as they are not disrespectful in any way. From what you have said, your comments were nothing more than playful banter, like I have seen numerous times when families are watching memorial videos. Someone showed discomfort and you stopped right away. I see no issue with this."
cc4fww,"NTA. She shouldn’t be using that word, especially if you asked her not to."
cc4hjg,"You need to do what's best for you, 
And I can completely understand I've cut all contact with my toxic family, and am much better off without them, maybe have a chat to a councillor or professional to help you work though this moment. 
Your deff NTA. Best of luck"
cc4hn6,[deleted]
cc4k9h,NTA can't see the picture but this isn't your fight to fight
cc4l0o,"NTA. If they hadn’t unblocked you and tried to act like nothing happened, I would’ve suggested that you leave it be and move on, but *they* reinitiated contact, not you. You deserve an explanation before continuing this friendship."
cc4mne,[deleted]
cc4omw,"YTA. Anxious person here. My blood pressure went through the roof just by reading this. 

Why was it necessary to trick him? Sink or swim trial for what?

I do appreciate all the baby steps you’ve taken with Tom though."
cc4ooi,"NAH - he’s just doing his job and you don’t need his services, which you made very clear"
cc4pjl,Take this to a relationship advice sub
cc4qgt,"NTA. You don’t live there, why should you pay. Don’t let her punk you"
cc4qzh,"NTA 

Being related by blood doesn't make you owe them anything."
cc4saf,"NTA.

This idea that you should step in and defend or protect or even take sides with someone who made absolutely no attempt to get to know you seems absurd to me.

You want familial support? Cultivate familial relations. Don't cultivate familial relations? Sure, no problems--but then don't expect familial support.

It's like expecting a stranger to stick up for you as if they were your friend this whole time."
cc4ssy,NTA you are NEVER an asshole for reporting a drunk driver. Never.
cc4vta,"YTA for thinking that high school isn't mentally and physically exhausting. You could have made your argument without that bit. Should be first come first serve, in my opinion."
cc4y38,"YTA 

Unless your SO is making these demands on you, ""zero wait time/cold food is a sin/can't function"", these are YOUR hang ups. You are the one putting so much pressure on the meal and your SO doesn't share the obsession. You need to learn to make more flexible meals that can be warmed up later. Life is complicated enough without having to worry about the *perfect* dinner every night."
cc5291,NTA. Time to get a label maker my man.
cc55zb,"YTA. It doesn't matter if you paid. He wasn't for sale. I am sorry because I know what it's like to love a dog, but he is not yours."
cc56we,"NAH, it’s Dora, it’s made for that age group.

From experience though, unless your 3 yo is exceptionally low maintenance, (which she very well might be. Who am I to say otherwise)— they get bored twenty minutes in and either fall asleep or start fidgeting / talking / looking for something else to do. They’ve got too much energy to enjoy it anyway."
cc57y1,"NTA. If they're going to make you park further away, they can make sure that you're walked out with someone. Buddy system works, man.

Also fuck off to that user who said to stop living in fear. For women, high fear and situational awareness go hand in hand. Do what makes you feel safe, gal pal."
cc5a2g,"YTA. You can expect her to repay the damage, but not buy you a whole new car (unless it ended up totaled, which it didn’t.)"
cc5dzw,NTA. You've already cut the siblings out of your life for apparently good reason and your well-being has improved. There's no reason for you to jump back in for the sake of a wedding when they've apparently made no amends for/changes to the behaviors that caused you to cut them out in the first place.
cc5g33,"NTA

That is SO not cultural appropriation. If he made it for you, it’s yours. He can’t take it away. Also, folded paper is not a Japanese-exclusive thing. I say either talk to him or find a better boyfriend."
cc5jf0,">because she wanted closure

Listen, maybe you are one human in a gazillion. Maybe you are that one sparkly, shiny, chosen one, who really, deep down, in your heart of hearts, wanted to give her closure. 

But I think if you're being honest, you're like every other human who's had a crush, and mildly manipulated a situation to get a little closer to that person. 

It's still a dick move, though. Whether you were being selfless or selfish, you put her through pain when you could have just kept your nose out of where it doesn't belong.

**EDIT** to say YTA."
cc5l5p,"I'm not goig to give an official vote to be counted, but I'll say that ... kinda, yeah. 

Look I know that 1st birthdays are important for parents but your child will not remember a first birthday. It will literally have no meaning for him/her. And it's kind of selfish to expect everyone else in the family (including people who live half a world away) to base their schedules on your child's birthdate. 

And if your husband's family is already balking (for no reason taht I can see) at meeting their daughter's husband's family, it would be a really nice good-will gesture for your husband to go and support his sister and meet her new family. 

Especially now with modern communication, there's no reason you couldn't have your husband Skype into your child's birthday or even (since your child won't remember it) hold the party a week early or a week late so your husband can be there too."
cc5orf,"YTA You know that both things you did were wrong and did them anyways.

You're a major asshole for taking a left at a no left. I had a friend do this when ""the street was pretty quiet"" and got T-boned by a guy who came out of nowhere. His wife was 7 months pregnant and they lost the baby. Don't drive like an asshole, especially with your child in the car."
cc5p06,[deleted]
cc5uy7,"YTA, you didn’t even consult with him first? A large decision that will violently change the nature of your relationship? He has every right to be mad. He is probably right, I’m guessing the job is more important to you than he is. Which is fine, it’s your life. At least be honest with yourself."
cc5vyn,"NTA. ""If you don't let me take advantage of you we're all going to suffer"" is a classic, classic line. Why do you feel guilty? Knowing about and calling for your rights is, you know. Your right. 

She is, however, correct that often unpaid or underpaid overtime is standard for the industry. Part of the reason it's a shit industry. Personally I would push for what I'm owed. There's always restaurant jobs out there, turnover is high because owners/manager are often awful."
cc5xkn,"NTA. She clearly has a bias against immigrants by the way she worded her sentence, and we are all allowed our opinions but personally I completely disagree and wouldn’t want to be associated with someone with that mentality 🤷🏻‍♂️"
cc5z2f,"This is y'all's trip, not her trip. As far as I'm concerned you get a veto, as does she. There's enough things to see in the world that you would both be interested in. 

From what you wrote I think you're maybe judging this guy pretty harshly and assuming certain things about him. I'm not going to comment on whether you're correct or not, but from your wife's reaction it sounds like you may have pushed that a little too far. You could have just said, ""that won't be fun for me and I don't think the trip is worth it."" However, I think NTA. 

By the way, Bumfuck is pretty boring, but I hear East Bumfuck is up and coming and actually have a couple of brewpubs now."
cc60c3,"NTA

Sounds like this guy is taking you for a ride."
cc60j9,"YTA,  but isn't a huge deal. It's more like, you were inconsiderate. Saying that it ""would be cool"", is basically saying yes. You should have said that you would think about it and were unsure what you wanted to do."
cc61c2,"NTA if you have tried on multiple occasions to shut down the suggestion of an open relationship that's a huge red flag, I don't think she is treating you very fairly especially with a selective talking schedule. End it and try to move on, because it sounds like she already has sadly."
cc62sw,"I dunno, but I'd definitely be getting your own quote. $1000 sounds like bullshit. Either your mum is bullshiting you, or you're bullshiting us on the extent of the damage."
cc63rx,Sorry that wasn’t worded well. You wouldn’t be the asshole no matter what but if you’re into her it can possibly signal more of an “I’m nuetral “ vibe than “I’m on your team” vibe. Your call ultimately tho
cc64t3,"NTA, you’ve obviously tried being reasonable. I’d rehome the cat and tell them if they try to dig up my yard I’ll call the police, but I’m a bit of an asshole once people have worn out decency."
cc65l5,"NTA. You have doctor’s orders not to work, and she shouldn’t be questioning it."
cc68pa,"NTA. While there are better ways to handle the situation, you gave a clear signal that you were uncomfortable and the lols kept on rolling..."
cc6ea3,"NTA

Rules are fine, but the picture thing is weird and invasive."
cc6j5g,"NTA. THis isn't a hobby this is a second, full time job. This is bullshit and she knows it or she wouldn't have laid out all that manipulation."
cc6lit,"ESH

You all suck for not figuring this shit out prior to signing the lease. Your roommates are assholes for picking dibs on rooms without your input. You are an asshole for thinking that two people sharing one room should pay the same as people with their own rooms. 

Your ultimate square footage solution makes some sense but it seems like you were all assholes about it."
cc6m44,"I mean, without knowing specifics, I'd guess that YTA, because she told you she doesn't want to talk or be babied, but you insist on making her talk and doing things for her. Maybe just let her grieve in her own way."
cc6sms,NTA she probably doesn’t give a shit her uncle died she’s just using it for sympathy points
cc6tt5,"YTA

Your career prospects aren't going to be affected. Stop being melodramatic."
cc6vvd,"NTA

Does your dad realize he, too, suffers from disordered eating?"
cc6wgt,"NAH, you gotta be careful about your audience with humor. Don’t make jokes putting down autistic folk if you’re not 100% sure of your audience."
cc6xnq,"NTA. It’s your mouth. Your preference. Just like the push for paper straws, hate them, at that point I’m just sipping from the cup."
cc6ymh,"[here you go! :)](https://imgur.com/gallery/d1x8J2a)

EDIT: i didn’t realize I had made that selfie public on Imgur, so here’s the new link with the hidden post (i deleted the other one) [here you go pt. 2!](https://imgur.com/a/ML3T2ac)"
cc6zys,"Might be unpopular but ESH.

YTA for this: 

> She mentioned that Caden had asked her to hang out, not knowing that he wanted to be more than friends with her. So, we mentioned that Caden was romantically interested in her

You didn't  have a right to tell someone that Caden was interested in them.

NTA for revealing the text, at that point they deserve to know so they can avoid Caden in future."
cc6zyx,Put a giant dildo in one of your drawers for her to find. Maybe that will shock her enough to stop treating you like a child.
cc71k0,NTA. Tell them to change their kids name.
cc75g3,"NTA but no one needs to wear a bra in private, let her live a little bit, shirt only.

And tell her it makes you uncomfortable without calling her gross/fat/old/whatever otherwise YWBTA"
cc76a3,"NTA, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink. You can drown the bastard, but that's a bit extreme.

You've bent over backwards, and even sacrificed time with your significant other. I think you need to take your own advice and set some new boundaries with your friend.

Because if you continue down this road, you are going to begin to resent and possibly hate her. You need to cut her off in that department, I agree with you there. 

She's what I call an Askter, a person who constantly asks for advice, but than completely ignores it. Does what they want anyways than comes back, to ask Again. When they didn't fucking listen the first time. 

Good luck, I don't think you're an asshole."
cc77lf,"NTA Almost seemed like the bar tender scammed you with that remark he made. 

This is also one of the fanciest posts I’ve seen on reddit."
cc7bnh,"NTA. I have a friend like this. When he goes over the line, I let him know.

Video games are supposed to be fun. Even if he was a pro, that behavior is uncalled for. When he gets like that, just leave and let him play alone if he won't listen to reason. 

I get being competitive, but come on. He could have easily muted his cousin instead of typing out a message.

Just tell him you play for fun and don't like when he gets that way. If he doesn't even TRY to be better about it, just leave the game."
cc7ehr,NTA. But don't tell other people in your field when you have an interview or find opportunities.
cc7get,"NAH, nothing wrong with wanting to fuck as long as you aren't pressuring/nagging her on for it. She can be not interested now, feelings change."
cc7hcl,"You are not an ass hole, just an idiot"
cc7jkw,"YTA You could try talking to your parents about the barking and ask if you guys can come up with some things to try and stop it. If the vet hasn’t been consulted yet, that’s definitely the first step to suggest. 

Having sleep interrupted constantly is awful and can affect your health. I can understand why you’re upset. But your family also has an obligation to care for this dog, and care for him well, for his entire life. That includes his annoying old age."
cc7k5m,"YTA.  I'm rereading your post.  ""I can't responsibly agree to you getting a haircut right now""  What are you, her dad, trying to prevent her from buying a lifetime supply of PopRocks?  Who talks to their wife like this?  You fucked up.  Find a way to get her her haircut - even if it means PUTTING IT ON A CREDIT CARD (gasp!).  Apologize for being an ass.  Never again call HER selfish for what YOU messed up.

(Original comment: INFO: Is there something in the next 6 weeks you could give up, to free up the money for her haircut?  Since it was your mistake and all?)"
cc7lc9,NTA: he is entitled to NOTHING. Don't let him guilt you into derailing the positive things you are doing for yourself. He should be happy you wanted to compromise after so long of taking him for free breakfast.  He is quite selfish.
cc7llh,NTA but your Japanese coworkers would disagree. I’m sure you are familiar with the culture and how that subtle guilt is definitely laden with judgement. You’ll probably never really be looked at as reliable but oh well. If you’re not Japanese they’re probably judging you poorly anyway. I’d just play the big foreign doofus and take the vacation. If you catch shade just act concerned and oh my why didn’t anyone say anything? I just thought because no one really came to me and said no I was ok. Oh gosh I would’ve stayed. But no you wouldn’t have. They know it. You know it.  But no one will actually say anything. God. It like an entire country full of my mothers.
cc7lv0,"NTA.  If she wants it, she comes and gets it, the end.  If it means that much to her she'll make the effort."
cc7nim,NTA you dad has some problems. Is he by any chance one of the BACK IN MY DAY...people?
cc7yad,"NTA there’s a noise ordinance. You’re not an asshole for expecting a business to abide by it. You might try city hall if you don’t want to call the police though. Maybe someone there can give them a friendly reminder without anyone getting a ticket? That’s just a guess though. I live next to a bar...there’s never a peep from it even on live music nights. They have sound proofing, obviously. That bar needs to invest in some if they want to operate within city limits."
cc7ytt,"NAH. She’s your friend and you have legitimate concerns, and you can discuss them in a mature way with her."
cc7zxi,"NAH, you used a word without knowing who would be affected by it, but attempted to correct/apologize for using it. You don't know about her life experience as a lesbian, which isn't your fault, and so she may take more time to get over it. Hopefully she will, but you'll have to be more careful OP!"
cc803l,NTA. You can certainly ask her. Just like you can ask people who smoke to not do it around you. If she brushes it off then you need to decide when and where you can hang out.
cc83p3,"NTA. I assume there would be supervision every night anyway. Don't see how your presence would make a difference.

Regardless if it puts you in an awkward social situation, it could impact your daughter negatively. She's known this friend since first grade(so appx 4 years) and this is the first sleepover? Inviting yourself along could insult the parents and make sure there is no play dates in the future.

A big part of sleepovers as a kid is getting away from your parents for a sense of pseudo-freedom. 

You could always ask your ex how she would feel if another parent spontaneously asked to be present, unprovoked"
cc84eu,"YTA 

The cashier simply did his job. The fact that you worked outside in the sun is your private issue. The fact that your ID is damaged and you did not replace it is again your mistake. Basically, you offended the person for your own mistakes."
cc87tc,"NTA

It sounds like he needs to hear some harsh realities to get better, and while you might have said it a little too ""aggressively"" it might be better for everyone in the long run. I wish the best for both of you."
cc890q,"YTA

The man was asleep. How do you expect someone to get woken up and be all nice? When I get woken up I stab people. You got off easy.

&#x200B;

He even offered to cuddle. How needy can you be?"
cc8bs8,"NTA. Not sure of the legality of the situation, but you gave her unofficial notice multiple times that you’d be leaving ASAP and she waited until you found a place to remind you of the contract? Seems kinda weird. 

Don’t expect her to give you a glowing reference for your next job though. That’s the kinda thing you have to let go of when you leave a job w/o the customary notice period."
cc8cct,NTA. if a friendship becomes toxic to you or causes you pain you have the right to end it at any time.
cc8e2t,"YTA

""instead of talking to my bf I decided to make extra drama. Am I an asshole?"""
cc8egx,There's something wrong with your mother. NTA
cc8rwk,NTA: Queer is a reclaimed word for LGBT people that was used in a very hateful way for most of its history. It's no surprise that some LGBT people would still be offended by it and your opinion on the matter should be respected.
cc8rwr,NTA — this dude needs to grow the fuck up.
cc8woj,"ESH. Your cousin is clearly in the wrong for taking your bike without permission. However as you admit, you snapped, and it doesn’t sound like you handled the situation in the best way possible; yelling like a maniac and not caring if you’re scaring little kids isn’t cool. Uncle sucks for his lack of parenting skills. Hindsight is 20/20 and I’m sure it’s easier said than done when you’re emotional but a better response may have been “if you can’t respect my belongings and my way of making a living you’re welcome to leave.” Something along those lines puts responsibility for the cousin’s actions and the opportunity to apologize (though I doubt he would) on him."
cc90cw,"NTA - your dad said you have a choice, so the choice is yours to go or not. it seems like she is just pushing the idea herself."
cc959f,"NAH

Let your Dad ask if you're invited or not and take it from there."
cc975x,"YTA

Being in hospital is horrible and visitors can lighten the stay. It wouldn't really have put you out to walk that extra ten minutes."
cc97f7,NTA.  If she gets pulled over your car could get impounded.  If she gets in an accident your insurance most likely would not cover an unlicensed driver.  If you let her drive you are opening up yourself to a lot of potential legal and money issues.  Make sure to keep the car keys secure and out of her reach.
cc98tz,Of course you're NTA. Ditch the mooch and move on.
cc98ym,"NAH, I play d&d regularly and I also had a very hard time getting my character involved in the story due to anxiety. So I do get where she’s coming from. But it’s not like you didn’t want her at your table due to anything malicious. You gave good reasons as to not have her there again, you didn’t make her feel bad about her meek ways. I say you did the right thing. Not your responsibility to help her open up."
cc9b42,"ESH

Jesus, just send one text. The send button isn’t punctuation. Also, your mom is right, you should have made better word choices. 

Your mom needs to realize that what she did was dangerous. Many drugs have a very narrow therapeutic index. Luckily, you were okay this time, but taking more than the recommended dose can have serious and dangerous consequences.
And also her threatening you with the silent treatment is just plain childish.

ETA: also, it’s not true that only children get nauseous after taking antibiotics on an empty stomach. The doctor sucks for not telling you this.

Edit #2: I apologize for incorrectly assuming OP’s mom gave him additional antibiotics. Even though she didn’t force OP to ingest more than the recommended dose of his prescription, I think I’m going to stick with my original judgement. It sounds like she gave him pills that were originally prescribed to her, that’s still dangerous."
cc9f1r,YTA. Are you seriously refusing to speak to your best friend over a difference of opinion about the significance you can attach to a disgusting public trend?
cc9h98,NTA. Your girlfriend sounds like she’s pretty insecure about her breasts and that’s what caused her outburst. I think your best course of action is to keep reiterating how sexy and beautiful you think she is... and possibly be more selective in which artwork you show her in the future.
cc9hrg,NTA. But he could be working through something right now. So maybe you should try to talk to him to see what’s up?
cc9lpf,"NTA. You're concerned for your friends. That's not an asshole move at all. Maybe try and get your brother some help, if you can. Talk to your parents?"
cc9m2v,"NTA “Even though...he’s a great guy” says every abused woman at some point.  They’re not mutually exclusive.  He doesn’t have to be a monster to be abusive.  And he didn’t ‘accidentally’ throw something at you, he recklessly did.  This will only get worse once you’re in a position where you really can’t get out easily.  Anyone who tries to keep you from visiting your family (unless they’re abusive) should throw up some red flags"
cc9ogr,"Edit 2: So it turns out OP is a hypocrite on top of everything cos he actually slept with this girl on that same trip, knowing she had a boyfriend who he 'highly doubts would accept this behaviour'. And now says he doesn't care cos they haven't been together that long. Would just love to be a fly in the wall for his HR meeting, or the chat with the boyfriend. Yeesh, with friends like this...

&#x200B;

On another note, I'm top comment??! Little old me?!? Cannot believe it, still not 'Best' but I don't know what the difference is. I shall find out and do that next, and then get the medals on the edge, and then take over the world, and ban sanctimonious, hypocritical twits like OP. MUHAHAHAHAH

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit to YTA.

I'm a bit confused. If you're not going to mention her sleeping with others, why are you mentioning it here? It really reads like that's what's bugging you.

""My issue was her going out drinking with guys in class, getting wasted and spending the night at their place.""

And then you say, ""I probably won't mention her sleeping with guys."" Is that the issue or not?

Does she do her work well?

&#x200B;

Edit: Read your other replies. I'm going to say YTA. Your issue is that she ""crossed the line ethically"". You're also not sure what work policy she violated. If you suspect she's cheating, as your friends talk to her about that, or leave it. You also say in future she may stumble if she doesn't go over the reading. You said you may help her, so tell her straight if you will or won't. You don't even seem sure what you'll be complaining about, so except a moral urge, so I'd say leave it."
cc9s6a,YTA. Not necessarily for eating it but if you were going to ignore them anyway why ask? Also a bus is a confined space.
cc9s7j,NTA. She doesn't have to pay you money but she gets to drag an electric razor across your leg?
cc9y9m,NTA. People react to death in different ways. What you've described isn't bad behaviour.
cca231,"NTA

You should talk to him about it though, don’t just cut him off. Give him a chance to find a way to connect with you!"
cca2kp,"NTA, always leave a place cleaner than you found it."
cca5ij,"NTA for not sharing notes. They should have paid more attention during class. 

A little bit of an asshole for regularly holding up lecturer (primarily due to a self-induced medical issues). Sure, you paid money to be there, but so did everyone else. That’s what tuition is. 

Them leaving and not including you probably had less to do with not sharing notes and more to do with them perceiving you as an outcast, especially if they didn’t know about the medical reason behind your questions."
cca64s,"NTA. 

This can be done in a diplomatic way: ""I know you are very into dieting and I'm glad it is working for you, but it can be triggering for me to talk about it. Would you mind discussing it less when we are together?"""
cca6a4,"NTA. Your friend isn't there yet, but it might help him to read about ""nice guys"" and understand that he's starting to tend towards that mindset in a few ways. It starts innocently enough, feeling sorry for yourself about how you'll never get a girl. Those feelings, left unchecked, fester and become something wholly undesirable."
cca6f0,"NTA - but get a job when you move. If anything, start your search for jobs in your new location now. Apply already and try and line up as much as you can. I understand her parents feelings, but if you’ve had the money to cover thus far, it’s not as bad. 

Good luck with your job hunt OP."
cca70d,"ESH. You already established that they suck, and lying is an asshole move too."
cca89k,"Nta
She's giving you the run around and you're right. She's just not that into you."
cca9j0,NAH. Be upfront about the time commitment (getting the rest done in less than 2 months) and explicitly tell him it's **not** because of workmanship or quality.
ccabfx,"ESH - it seems like an over reaction on the bride’s end, but it’s always possible that some things happened that you weren’t aware of while you were blacking out and what your behavior was like. 

You suck because you didn’t know your own limits and couldn’t self-enforce them. When you go out with friends, it’s no ones job to babysit you. They’re all there to have a great time too and when you can’t moderate yourself, you pull away from the enjoyment of others."
ccag0t,"NAH. She’s nervous. This is her first child and she needs to feel like she’s in control and that everything is safe and good. I think her saying those things to you is more a reassurance to herself than anything else. But that said, you obviously know what you’re doing for all of the reasons you’ve mentioned. Maybe just work to make her feel comfortable, and let her know that your boy’s safety and comfort is Priority Number One to you as well."
ccagnl,"NTA. Sounds more like you need to claim your rightful dominance in the heirarchy, seems like the fact that she runs the show is really what’s annoying."
ccamf9,"YTA. “I will have it paid off before the baby comes”, which means you are about to have a baby, but don’t have $500 in savings.

And you don’t know why this would bother your fiancé?"
ccaovv,"It's her money, you didn't 'let' her buy shit. She bought it.

If your mum's mad, she should be mad at your sister, but she doesn't have any reason to be mad.

NTA."

Yeah it sucks but it's supposed to make other employees not complain about favoritism even though they do the least amount of work and sit on their phones like at my job lmao."
ccapl1,"NTA. Beth deserves her money, and there isn’t really any way for her to get it without you getting involved."
ccarat,"ESH - Instead of yelling, try pooping in her yard to establish dominance."
ccaryk,"NTA. It's a generational difference in etiquette. Don't stress, but to keep the peace maybe do what they want next time. It's not a big deal."
ccauon,"YTA- hear me out- i understand wanting to let someone know if someone is talking shit behind their back- thats legit. 

But, you already spoke to the manager, they already said (lie or not) that it wasnt about you 2- and you guys already squashed the problem. 
At this point bringing it up just reignites petty work drama and potentially hurts a possibly unrelated person. 

Your boss needs to get work shit off social media- most of us feel that way about a certain coworker- and most workplaces have strict social media restrictions.  

I really feel like brjnging this back up is a bad idea. If an additional instance occurs- bring it up then. Dont start drama over one post you cant actually confirm.  (Save the screenshot though!)"
ccauzl,"ESH - Learn from other people on AITA who've made this mistake. I don't think it would make you a huge asshole or anything, but lying as a way to get out of setting firm boundaries isn't productive. Saying a very firm ""No, I do not eat seafood"" and continuing to refuse will send a clearer message that your relatives/friends need to respect YOU, not just an allergy.

edit: Changed to ESH because anyone who nags someone else about what they eat is a dick"
ccavob,"She started walking more *just to win a challenge* which is specifically designed to motivate both of you to walk more? 

She pursued a professional degree just to spite your \*lowly\* culinary degree?

She asks you about your work?

She is interested in your relationships?

She paid for your drinks?

What a jerk.

ccavw5,"YTA, your birthday wasn’t forgotten you just didn’t get what you wanted. Be appreciative they don’t owe you anything."
ccawo0,"Your brother has money to visit hookers, but he can't pay for his own car?

NTA. Maybe he'll stop visiting hookers if he HAS to pay for his car repairs."
ccax8f,"NTA- your brother can and needs to make his own food seeing as he does this normally already. Would it have been nice if you? Yes but, you don’t have to do anything for him."
ccayto,">which is inherently stuff that he likes but doesnr know because he doesnt try until me

Ding ding ding.

Your boyfriend does things he doesn't expect to enjoy because they make you happy. You refuse to attempt the same for him.

YTA for not reciprocating and at least attempting. It's not like the path is MADE of spiders."
ccb1pe,"NTA - If your dad is suffering financially, a tactful and quiet conversation separated from the rest of the family may be in order. Don't make a big thing out of it or involve anyone else, but just express your concern to him and say you want the best for him. After that, stay out of it."
ccb1zk,"NTA. It’s your birthday and you’re not under any obligation to invite anyone, family or not."
ccb2ah,"NTA. You put up with it as long as you could. And you should not be expected to be someone's dishwasher or housekeeper if they are not contributing to the household at all. The least he can do is help around the house. He is not entitled to free amenities without contribution. And if your boyfriend doesn't understand this, then he's the asshole along with his friend."
ccb5jr,"This was a pain in the ass to read. Editing is your friend.

But yes, YTA. 100%. You stuffed your friend around, in favour of getting high.

Also, here's a nifty idea. If getting that high makes your existing stomach issues worse, DON'T DO IT, DINGUS. No sympathy, at all."
ccb60m,"As someone who worked in customer service and billing... NTA. 

You are 100% correct that you are not responsible for how they manage their paperwork on their end. I used to have people call me up before tax season to try and get me to print a year’s worth of bills and records for them. It wastes time and company resources, so, no.
Not my responsibility to pick up your slack. If you needed all that paperwork, you should have kept and filed it. 

Same thing here. A customer demanding that you use a tool that your place of business does NOT to then send them an invoice is ridiculous and could even open you up to more liability."
ccb7uy,"NTA. I’m not one for ultimatums but this is a situation where he needs one. 

Stop giving her money or you’re done. 

Honestly though, I’d probably leave him if we couldn’t go on a trip because he gave the money to his sister and hid it after you had asked him to stop."
ccb7yg,"Read this the first time. NTA.

&#x200B;

I almost wanna say yes you are for not calling CPS by now. Get that kid out of there before it's too late."
ccbcgr,"NTA. What a gross over-reaction from her. Splitting the bill is not unusual and not shocking.

She seems kind of entitled and I don't think you should be pushing for a third date...."
ccbcjs,"NTA, there’s nothing wrong with wanting to spend time with another adult without the distraction of children.  If she’s unable to compromise to participate in your planned activities then finding someone who is would be a reasonable thing to do."
ccbgti,"NTA - Usually stooping to someone's level makes it an everyone sucks situation, but in this case...these situations are not at all equal. You were worried about serious problems with potentially life-altering consequences. She was complaining about not being able to party."
ccbhj1,"Tough, but I'm going to go with ESH. You made his transision about you and suggested he wasn't serious about it. He accused you of being scared of transitioning and didn't talk to you about his transition prior to starting hormones. His partner cursed you out. You poor mom is the only one who isn't TA IMO"
ccbi0u,"NTA. 
You invited your mother, not her friend. If she wants to bring someone else then she should look into a hotel or air b&b for the two of them. 

It’s incredibly rude for her to invite a stranger to stay at your home."
ccbkmv,NTA. You're giving him some brotherly advice. Don't expect him to take too well to the advice though. Usually the cheatee is under the cheater's spell and is being manipulated.
ccbnfl,"I don't know why you'd drag his mum into it and create even more drama for yourself.  Take the guy the court, seek a judgment against him for what he owes you.  If the court agrees he owes the money, they will order that he pay you potentially on a repayment schedule reflective of what he can afford to repay.  

Deal with it like a responsible adult.

Honestly I think half the posts here at the moment are just looking for advice and are on the wrong sub.  Set out the facts on r/legaladviceuk and get some advice. Leave the emotional stuff out of it.

ESH if you go dragging his mum into things."
ccbpic,"NTA - You're splitting the cost, you both got some of a low quality batch, you both got compensated for it, but your roommate took most of your portion of the compensation.

Sounds like he's changing the rules of your halfsies agreement."
ccbqrz,"ESH - also, G is playing you. He got to hook up with two for the price of one. Of course he tells you he's more into you... all while probably telling E in private that he's more in to her. Dump this loser."
ccbse9,"YTA.  You honestly think it's reasonable that what's your mom's is yours to take at will yet you shouldn't have to share anything?  Your mom is right - you're acting like a spoiled only child and it's especially offensive considering how generous your parents have been by sharing everything with you and subsidizing you years into adulthood.  If you want to act ""like adults"" then you need to start acting like an adult first - by paying your own way.  When you pay 100% of your own expenses and contribute your share to the general household then you can start with the petty demands and labeling your food; until then - say thanks to your mom and be glad all you're paying for is special ice cream."
ccbtr4,"You said it wasn't a relationship post.  Liar!

She's probably just bummed that they ruined the surprise.  Why don't you get something nice to surprise her instead.

NAH."
ccbw9n,"YTA. You didn't talk through the whole party, except to ask them to pass you things? That goes way beyond tiredness, into sulking and rudeness. 

If you're really that tired, you tell your friends and family - who love you and care about you or they wouldn't be there - that you're exhausted, and you reschedule.

You need to sort your sleep schedule out, and if It's being caused by gaming, that means there's a problem with your gaming that you need to fix pronto."
ccbwe9,"NTA

If you're in college, you're an adult and you have the right to decide to do with your own time.  It would probably be best to make an effort to go to a few of these things, if nothing else just to keep your mom and sister company but your dad can't expect that you're going to continue going on his trips indefinitely. That's what happens when people grow up, get careers and families... this is just the beginning so he might as well start getting used to it."
ccbzze,Nta. Protect your kids.
ccc17f,"NTA

When you move out, cut ties and go no contact. You don’t owe an abuser anything. He already took all that he’s going to get."
ccc3d4,"NTA. The people who showed up drunk and caused drama are, though."
ccc3hc,I think you know you were the asshole in high school and are now seeking validation and applause for being a decent human being
ccc5ar,"NTA. Your parents need to respect your boundaries. They’re free to fly whenever, wherever they want, but you’re under no obligation to let them stay with you or meet up with them."
ccc6aw,"NAH.

He's right to point out that he's covered you and you haven't returned the favor yet, but you can't help if you've got plans. I would reply that you totally understand and make some sort of deal about covering him next time as long as you have enough notice."
ccc6nl,"NTA if you really mean it, want it and don't do it just to get at her."
cccb50,"NTA  


This is YOUR future, not hers.  As your mother, which means her finances come into play for financial aid, and honestly just because she is your mother, she certainly has a right to an opinion and having that opinion be heard, but you've already offered that.  At the end of the day, you will choose the school you go to, and you absolutely have a right to privacy.  She can certainly arbitrarily punish you for exercising it, but you still don't have to give her your password and access."
cccd3v,"NTA.

You were as polite as possible, literally even after telling him to stay off the property - you were still nice about it. How the fuck does this conversation even last 10 minutes? I'd be done at that point too. Boundaries needed to be drawn. Good on yah, hope money becomes a little less tight for you soon OP!"
cccd9m,"ESH if you wanted to see your friends you would have reached out to them when you got there, not relying on them remembering something for three weeks.  If they really wanted to see you they might have put a bit of effort into remembering you were there."
cccdat,NTA what is that dudes problem? Why on earth would he think it’s okay to not call you by your actual name? Especially when repeatedly asked! The dude sounds like a massive a-hole and I’m happy for you that he no longer works at your company.
cccerd,">she talks shit about other people to me,

Then she talks shit about you to other people then."
ccchy1,NTA. The mom is clearly a homophobic asshole. You responded completely appropriately.
cccimc,"I think it's a bigtime asshole move to admit you want to convert someone. The whole missionary aspect of Christianity is assholey in general to me, but come on... if an atheist friend or family member let you know they were on a mission to show you why your beliefs are wrong, it would be insulting and annoying."
cccnkk,"NTA. It's called common courtesy. Probably could have asked nicer but if you know someone is sleeping for good reason, put some headphones in. I don't get it when people live in the same house but blast anything when people are sleeping."
cccnvo,"YTA. You’re putting too much pressure on the kid when he’s already pulling great grades. If your son is telling you the class is hard, believe him. Clearly he’s no dummy if he’s got A’s in his other subjects. Seems weird to punish your kid for getting a passing grade."
cccnz7,"NTA, why the hell would your ex call you for help after THREE YEARS of no communication? Why was your number easier to dial than 911? Sounds like the ex was fishing for attention..."
cccr14,[deleted]
cccsxh,"ESH. They're terrible, but you can't backtrack on ""you don't have to pay this back."" Also, they aren't going to pay you back, let's be realistic. You're needlessly creating a problem because your ideal outcome is impossible.

Edit in response to edit. Regardless of the original terms, once you say repayment is off the table. It's off the table."
ccct1l,"NTA.  


Also, ""kids shouldn't live in a bubble"" - no, but it's pretty reasonable to expect that they're pretty innocent."
cccye0,"It's the norm to tip for hair cuts.  The fact that she's booked for months in advance and is a high end stylist indicates she's popular and good; that's why her cuts are expensive - she has plenty of people lined up to pay that.  Although there's no law requiring you to tip, if you like her cut, want to conform to social norms, not be a cheapskate and most importantly have her accept your appointments in the future, it would be a good idea to tip."
ccd28w,"NTA.  This is a perfectly reasonable stance, you just need to approach it maturely."
ccd69s,"NTA, he is trying to get free labor out of you.  You should inform the owners (assuming he isn't the owner)."
ccdeqv,[deleted]
ccdezn,"NAH, tell her you can't help her today that you already have plans. If you want to be nice offer a time tomorrow that's convenient for you."
ccdhyn,"YTA. What you’re actually annoyed by isn’t her having high standards, it’s that she complains to you about it and you should have just said you didn’t want to hear it anymore. You’re also an asshole for your “her looks are quickly fading” comment."
ccdi39,"NAH. I get why your wife wants another child, and I get why you don't think adoption is a good idea for you. I hope you guys can work it out so you are both happy with whatever happens."
ccdibg,"NTA.  And also, don’t let your sister use you as a free babysitter all week.  Make plans for yourself.   Stand up to your sister.  If she asks you to watch the kids, say that you planned on doing this that or the other thing, etc.

If you don’t correct your sisters behavior, you can’t expect it to change."
ccdlj3,"ESH.

Not super assholish but give them a warning before tossing their laundry. Maybe they didn't know it hurt you."
ccdmcl,NTA. I wouldn’t sign for it either. Have your grandmother put it in her name
ccdn0q,"NTA, I am so sorry for your loss and lack of understanding and support in your environment."
ccdnt3,NAH.   Why don’t you just ask your mom to show you exactly how she would like the towels washed to avoid her perceived issue?
ccdor5,[deleted]
ccdpas,"YTA.   Talking shit on social media is never OK.
It’s fucking tacky as hell.   If you lost 2/3 of your friends, that’s a huge clue for you that you were the asshole."
ccdph8,NTA. You did good. Kate doesn't get to do something and expect there to be no consequences. It's entirely on her own head.
ccdr14,"NTA. You're a minor, you can't be made to pay rent in the US. Any money you make is yours."
ccdr4g,"NAH.  If Chipotle gives you a free entree and they are willing to put triple meat on then its all good.  If they don't care, neither should you."
ccdroz,"YTA

Dude that’s a terrible idea, let him find out on his own. It seems like he still needs to move on too."
ccds4l,NTA. If you don’t like dogs that’s totally fine. But I would suggest in order to avoid drama just say you’re severely allergic to them. I hate chocolate and people refuse to believe I don’t like it. Growing up I used to get harassed for it. Now I’ve learned to lie and just say I’m allergic. Makes it clear I won’t eat it and I don’t have to listen to someone rant and rave how great chocolate.
ccdtw1,"NAH for the rent, but you can't make her pay utilities. She signed a lease with the expectation she'd pay that rent, her circumstances changed and she didn't find a sublessor. That's on her, but the utilities are your responsibility."
ccdv9j,"NTA. It’s not like you wanted to just have a day off, you had a good reason. I would suggest talking to your boss first, pointing out your request and seeing if they’ll change it, but if you just call in they have lots of other people they can call."
ccdvdr,NTA. Talk to her and tell her how all this is making you feel. Hopefully she'll understand.
ccdvwg,NTA. Some people can't handle the truth.
ccdw5a,"NTA - Sounds like an equitable arrangement, even if he's not entirely thrilled with the idea.  Obviously, based on his comment, he's still dealing with stuff from the separation/divorce.  

I'd reach out to him, but don't think an apology is necessary.  I don't think it's unreasonable that you'd want to spend time with both.  Maybe you can focus on making plans for what you want to do when you visit him: ""Hey dad. Hope you're okay.  So, listen since I'll be out in Etobicoke from 8/1-8/15, I wanted to make the most of our time.  Anything special you wanted to do? I was thinking we should head over to Woodbine and then hit up one of the breweries."""
ccdy3c,YTA. You’re going to be her fucking stepmother and you want to start that relationship by excluding her? What’s wrong with you? You can have a “child free wedding” but your stepdaughter absolutely has to be an exception to that.
ccdy3z,"ESH

He shouldn’t be tweaking out, but you guys should have maybe went over things again instead of all taking time off without him even knowing."
cce0j6,[deleted]
cce1jz,"NTA

We might as well tip cashiers for ringing us up everywhere then right ?"
cce3am,"YTA. That's really tacky to do, especially over 20 dollars."
cce62v,"NTA for wanting to end the friendship. K sounds like someone who is very insecure and really wants to be liked and included, but that seems to be pushing people away. You can either give K that feedback and try to help, or end the friendship. Up to you."
cce6lz,"NTA. The neighbor does not leave the cat outside. The neighbor abandoned the cat outside and left it to die.

This is your cat now. Your cat will be happy and loved. The end."
cce7lo,"I don’t understand why that’s something to be mad about. With the current information given, NTA"
cce7rn,"YTA for not letting your friend know you couldn't make it, your comment was also passive aggressive."
ccec4y,"NAH - Parent's going through divorce is tough and I understand if you need alone time to process it. I personally think it might be good to get the courage and go since it is some quality family time and it might be good opportunity to voice your opinions, but if you don't feel ready then I wouldn't force yourself to."
ccef2q,"NTA - you are just trying to make her feel better, maybe you used the wrong words, but this don't make you TA. Watch out cause she may have a depression.

Edit: if you don't go on a trip, try to stay with her, she can be upset about it, even if she was the one who canceled it."
cceinl,"NTA- it's your wedding. I'd explain that they are more than welcome at the ceremony but the reception is adult only. Many reception locations have spare rooms, hire a babysitter, set up some toys  but let him know if they come into the reception area the whole family will be asked to leave. Because if you've told other guests it's a child free wedding someone is going to get upset if they see kids there. You are trying to keep the peace with everyone and also let the adults enjoy a one time celebration. Your BIL can stop in the room every 20 minutes if he wants to check but it's not fair of him to expect all other guests to accommodate his family and any tantrums, outbursts, or meltdowns from fatigue or overexcitement."
ccej0g,"NTA at all. They're being completely greedy and unreasonable, especially considering they want such a high rate as **backpayment** when they initially refused anything.

I'd probably find a new babysitter/childcare service if you believe that these tensions won't go away, especially if you think that it'll adversely effect the way they treat your daughter (I don't have enough context to know whether this is applicable-- but they don't seem like very reasonable people here)

You owe them nothing-- but especially not such an absurdly high amount of money that they think they're entitled to for something they offered to you as a favor."
ccej9u,"YTA

&#x200B;

You didn't specify so you got well whiskey, which is nasty. How would you have reacted to your bill if she had decided to make your whiskey and coke with Makers and hit you with that bill? 

&#x200B;

If you don't tell them what you want, you can't expect them to make it"
ccejt9,"Also I realize for future confusion, I am a lesbian. Not a guy."
ccel3o,"NAH: It is your mom's ring, so she technically can do with it what she wants... I completely understand your perspective too, though. Perhaps try having a calm discussion with her about how important it is to you rather than butting into a conversation that probably wasn't meant to involve you?

A sit down, and explain to her how she makes the ring important. It may impact her more."
cces7u,"YTA, how your in-laws spend their money is none of your business, whether they procreate is none of your business. Stop judging people, it's not like they're asking you for money, right?"
cceu94,"NTA. I would be really mad if my SO did this and frankly I’m surprised and disappointed at your workplace for allowing it. You each have your own relationship with your employee, and allowing him to do that doesn’t feel right."
cceybx,NAH.  BF should be understanding of this.  Just talk to him.
cceyj9,"NTA - Just tell her you don't want to be an accomplice to her spending habits. If she wants to sign up for that blog herself she can, if the $40/year is too much to her, then she really doesn't need to be worrying about any other bargains."
ccezh8,"NTA

Not to disrespect someone's beliefs, but furniture position does not cause cancer (unless you are positioning it over a radioactive source or something).

That being said, it is their house, and in the interests of keeping the peace you might want to compromise. I don't think you should have to, but then I don't believe in magic cancer lines..."
ccf641,"YTA

The first joke was a mistake and mis-read of the room. Once you realised that your sister was upset by it though going in again with another sex joke was a dick move. Not certain it was ""get out of the house"" worthy, but you certainly weren't the good guy there."
ccf7x3,"NTA - not only are you not the asshole. You need better friends. If he hasn’t paid you back from nine months ago, he’s not a very good friend."
ccf95p,NTA. it was a gift for you? Have you mentioned that. Your wife is either selfish or oblivious.
ccf9za,[deleted]
ccfaun,"YTA

Your friends used homophobic slurs to a gay couple and then followed them (because your friend likes provoking people?) There is no way that doesn't seem aggressive; from their perspective a gang of guys said they wanted to be able to call them ""fags"" and then followed them into an underground space from which they have limited room to escape.

You might think they overreacted to you guys laughing at them in the first instance, but given the amount of homophobic abuse going around they've probably had to deal with something similar in the past."
ccffz1,NTA - he's being a jerk.
ccfgdx,"YTA - that kind of apology should be given in person, not just texted or messaged. As someone that was outted when I wasn’t ready, it absolutely ruined high school for me. If someone just texted me an apology, I would assume they don’t actually care about me and care more about making themselves feel okay.

That being said, you talked about it on a stream. ThAt doesn’t seem extremely accidental - if so, it makes you extremely careless with someone’s secrets. I highly doubt she would really trust you. It seems like she doesn’t have an interest in your apology either. Maybe let it go and try to be a better ally to those still in the closet"
ccfhd6,NAH but as the downstairs neighbor they’re probably asking you to just a little conscious of your footsteps. My neighbors sound like they’re stomping around all the time and they probably aren’t
ccfhdd,"NTA. My boyfriend is a piano player who goes to Berklee who doesn't busk, and I don't see anything wrong with it, even though at one point I had three jobs to support us. I know the fact that I'm a musician too helps me understand why, but busking A. doesn't really often make you that much money and B. Is often exhausting/not helping you chase what you're ACTUALLY passionate about. That time would be much better spent actually PRACTICING and getting better at your craft."
ccfia0,[deleted]
ccfkxm,"NTA. As someone who was once a young girl in a similar situation, I am (now) very grateful for the person who stopped me. She will get over it eventually and understand why as she grows up."
ccfl96,Nta. Thats extremely disrespectful and out of line. Your brother should apologize. Youre doing the right thing by teaching him and it sounds like youre a really good brother.
ccfm9d,"NTA, he knows exactly what he's doing, which is checking to find out if you can be pressured into giving up your standards and boundaries for him."
ccfm9x,NAH- I could totally understand you not wanting to go as you didn’t know the friend. I can also see why your boyfriend is disappointed as it was clearly a vulnerable time. Best thing to do is talk it out.
ccfntb,"YTA. Firstly, you don't know how the mother was feeling. She could have been feeling really crummy that day, and really just wanted her husband to stay with her. Secondly, presuming you're going to be with your SO for a long time, you're going to have to deal with the mother sooner or later. My feeling is that you shouldn't be petty over this, and just let it slide."
ccfnto,NTA you are reassuring the patients.
ccfo3l,"NTA, doesn't even seem like ghosting you gave him some chances to step up."
ccfqhw,"NTA, it's a good question.

Also, maybe look for a new group, a DM shouldn't be allowing and definitely not rewarding unnecessary intragroup conflict

EDIT: Changed a word"
ccfryv,"NAH. Sounds to me like she was just asking, but you aren't a jerk for sticking with your original plans. Maybe you could help your dad out on Sunday?"
ccftjj,[deleted]
ccfwk7,NTA - she wouldn't have swapped seats if she thought it would be an issue. She didn't foresee the situation and that's on her.

Your dad’s past behaviour had a profound effect on you. Profuse apologies don’t magically fix that. Your feelings are valid. You don’t need to feel guilty for the lasting effects of *his* behaviour.

ccg429,"NAH

My reasoning is that your mom has been with this woman for years so it makes sense to want to include her in the family and family events. 

But because of your mom's lifestyle when you were younger, it has made you not want to have any part of it. Honestly, in my opinion, a single parent shouldn't be bringing around every person they date for their children to meet. And she would have over multiple partners at a time so I can see how that might have been damaging to a child. 

So on the flip side I could argue that E S H because of how your mother raised you but also you trying to hide what your mom is. 

This is weird territory."

ccgg8a,NTA... It seems weird but it's very clear etiquette. You do not tip the business owner.  It's how it works.   She literally sets the prices anyway.   It's all in her control unlike at someone else's salon. They usually rent their space there anyway.
ccghkh,"NTA

They are the asshole. They shouldn't be bitching about people at work. You have to be professional and civil at work, but you owe them no more than that."
ccgk7i,"ESH

You both trying to hustle each other instead of being a real team."
ccgkrr,"NTA

But I worry this will cause problems with your job. You're in the right, but the person in the wrong has more power. You might want to start looking for new jobs in case things turn sour here."
ccglrv,"NTA - I'm sorry people aren't being accommodating to the fact that you're hard of hearing. It's not that hard to pick up a pen and paper to ""talk"" to you."
ccgoo6,"NTA. I don't even understand how this makes you an asshole.

Edit: the people behind you are waiting for you to get served......you were not done. Simple."
ccgrwj,[deleted]
ccgt17,"NTA. This is FH's call and he gave you the green light. Grandmas are gonna grandma, but FH needs to make it clear with his mother."
ccgtdu,"NTA

This has been a bit of a trope on alot of subs lately.. And bottom line is that it is your wedding and you can and should do whatever you want with it. 

Wedding contributions should not come with strings attached."
ccguz4,"ESH you sound dramatic and clingy to s girl who isn’t being honest. She sucks stringing you along while also seeing other people. Also, you say this happened before you were exclusive but at what point did it become a relationship?"
cch0lx,"NTA, it seems like your 'rudeness' was just honesty about your situation. In this setting you're definitely entitled to find out where the hell your beer is."
cch0zk,"YWBTA. This isn’t your issue to get involved in. If your boyfriend needs the money back or can’t afford to front her money anymore, he needs to make that clear to her. If you get involved, you run the risk of really pissing off one or the other and landing yourself in an uncomfortable position."
cch2pd,"Ahhh, this takes my wayyyy back when I was your age, like 4 Years ago...

I'll give you a NAH

Girl, just write him very honestly about your feelings and try to make yourself vulnerable. Maybe he will follow your lead and he reveals what's actually going on inside his head? Or maybe he just tells you to shut up. Guess you'll have to ask him yourself. Good luck!"
cch35n,"NTA. she rescheduled and that's on her.

And for what it's worth, she doesn't sound very mature for a 40-year-old."
cch88f,"NTA, let her bury herself."
cchefw,"NTA. Unless your dog is a cartoon character, it's not producing enough fur for your neighbor to have a legitimate reason to complain."
ccheko,"NTA

&#x200B;

If she's hindering work then you have some obligation to your company to help maintain a good work culture. HAve a private conversation once, don't demand anything, just let the boss know your concerns. Also make sure you really are justified. At most suggest he pay a little more attention to her training etc."
cchk9h,"NTA.
This guy sounds unbalanced and avoiding him is the best thing to do."
cchkju,"ESH. Your friends shouldn’t be pressuring you that much, but if you go I do think you should chip in for gas. 

But if you keep going out after initially ignoring them, they’re learning that it takes however many minutes they’re there to get your attention. Solution? Next time they park in your driveway, lock the door, shut your phone off and crank the television up. Let them sit for as long as they like. They’ll get tired after an hour or two."
cchoi1,"NAH you shouldn’t have even kept the Apple Watch. You should have brought it to the Apple store and reported it. Then it’s rightful owner would have it.

Edit: I got more information and changed my answer."
cchoji,"NTA

It's your free week, you can do whatever you want. Though somehow the story sounds strange, as if something is missing."
cchou9,NTA. You don’t need to take the harassment.
cchp0m,Do I sound greedy? I really hope I’m not coming off as that. It’s more along the lines that I think he  has gone beyond familial responsibilities and my cousins are are just abusing his goodwill. My mom has actually asked me to talk to him about convincing to stop sending money because this is already a contentious issue between them. Honestly we’re not really well off plus I’m going to college soon and so is my sister next year and I think the money sent could be used to help his actual son and daughter. And also bills here at home. Sadly right now it’s just my mom covering for us here. As my dad works a job with low pay but amazing benefits. In the end I don’t see them as family aside from blood because they haven’t even tried to interact with us aside from asking for money and this point I would rather he help us be secure at home before he extends any support to others.
cchq8m,"NTA. You don’t owe him a thing. You, and your emotional wellbeing > your abusive father. Also, happy cake day!"
cchqi9,"NTA.   This person isn’t your friend. 

But you really aren’t refusing to hang out with her.  You were blocked."
cchrv9,"NTA, your boyfriend is abusive, plain and simple. “Why can’t you just be normal?” What a hideous thing to say to someone who is sick. Also, I would consider trying another therapist. As someone who has delt with and eating disorder, my head seriously almost blew off my fucking neck when I saw she wouldn’t talk to you unless you were medicated. You need a therapist **now**, *especially* if you’re getting medicated."
cchshc,NTA. That’s...a weird situation. Yikes.
cchthm,"NTA. Yknow how when you're flying and they tell you to put on your oxygen mask before helping others? Its the same idea here, you need to be able to put yourself first. If being there for her would hurt you, then you aren't required by any means to put yourself in that position."
cchw5n,what
cchxna,ESH. You suck for the ball retrieval comment - it was out of line and unnecessary. He sucks for going behind his wife’s back on something like this. I will reserve judgement on the wife because it isn’t clear what her issue with your friendship is and it’s quite possible you’re leaving that part out and glossing over it on purpose.
cci007,[deleted]
cci117,"NTA. It takes years for banana peels to decompose. She saw the trashcan and deliberately threw it into the bushes. I do believe you could have said it nicer since she was such a crybaby but at the same time I'm always mean to people who litter cuz they know that it's against the law. If they made me apologize it would have went ""Im sorry that you decided to break the law and i corrected your horrible action. Maybe next time you won't be stupid."""
cci1x5,YTA. If you really feel emasculated by the dogs haircut you have deeper issues. I see huge dudes with tattoos walking froo froo dogs. No one cares except you.
cci1z9,"YTA- it’s one thing to need a few bucks in change. It’s another to need almost $20 in change. Drivers are limited in how much money they can carry. And you might not have been the first stop. Next time, pay online and have some money for tip."
cci2zy,"NTA since they brought race into this first but I would definitely find a better way to say this.

For example, look at them like they're idiots, and say ""you do know Spain is in Europe, right?"""
cci3jk,"NTA. You can't be blamed that her father changed his mind on watching the movie. You even made the plans with her family, they backed out.

Personally, I've never understood some people's reservation with having to do something ""first"" as a couple. 

Definitely don't blow off your friend after he did you a solid."
cci4kj,NTA. Hostile workers make life shit for everyone.
cci4sp,[deleted]
cci4z5,NTA Sisters boyfriend is at fault for giving you the money straight up instead of waiting to see if you actually do something.
cci7vz,"NTA. You didn’t owe these people anything. If they really wanted the pic, they had plenty of other people to ask."
cci8ly,[deleted]
cci94r,"NTA, like, not at all"
ccia96,"Yta. He doesn’t owe you a car, period. You told him he could use it - so of course the mileage is going to be higher. If it bothers you that much, ask him to have it detailed to get rid of the smell."
cciahw,ESH. Neither of you are great at taking the other into account here. She’s being passive aggressive but you can’t expect someone to go without AC just because you get cold easily. I think it’s time to find a different place to live.
ccif74,"NTA. Sounds like he's the true asshole here. I understand that he thinks that ""a wife should trust their husband"" but he needs to understand that he can be wrong. He's also shifting the blame onto you which is why you're feeling like you're the ass. YOU'RE NOT."
ccimg6,Yea YTA . They may have been being insensitive but they weren’t talking to you. In your description you don’t believe the things they did talk to you about. To top it all off it seemed that you yelled at a black guy who speaks English that he’s African? None of this was your business and based on the story it’s hard to criticize them for anything other than being annoying to you.
cciseg,[deleted]
ccit4x,"YTA if you say this like you're planning on saying it. This is a nice thing you're expressing, Express it like a nice thing."
ccitom,NTA. Maybe talk to hr as well. Pay is pay and they owe it to you.
cciuev,"YTA - only for not asking beforehand.  That's just fucking rude dude, doesn't matter if its your son or anyone, you ask before you bring another person to a social gathering."
cciuh9,NTA. Why are you still dating this person?
cciw8r,"NTA. If anyone has what seems to be a harmless cold sore and kisses your baby on the lips, this could be deadly for your child who doesn't have a strong enough immune system to fight that off. All adults should refrain from kissing babies on the mouth. Do some research and pass this info along to your step mom."
cciwfs,"ESH.

Leaving your phone out while taking a nap is not an invitation to snoop through their phone, what the fuck?

He shouldn't be cheating.

She seems to be the only one who doesn't suck here. And she absolutely deserves to know."
cciz62,"NTA

Bruh this man bout to do some wack shit, have you seen the news recently ?"
ccj0uf,"YTA. making her wait a year is excessive. If shes asking and you keep not responding, she probably is thinking about it and feeling hurt."
ccj0x9,"A specialist couldn't hurt, but if your doctor isn't concerned I'd trust his analysis of the situation far more than two worrying grandparents. 

Your kid, your call. NTA. Though if they want to foot the bill for a specialist, bringing your kid in couldn't do any harm."
ccj154,"Ask the complex's management about their noise pollution rules; it would be better coming from management. As for outsiders using the pool - that is also the complex's management and depending of what, if any, security system there is, the police might be interested as well."
ccj21b,"NAH. First off you're never the asshole for feeling a certain way, as long as you are aware of it, and not actually acting on things if they come from a bad place. 

That said, this time you're also kind of justified. At the same time you may expect her and/or your parent(s) to be annoyed at you, because everyone will mostly always try to get every advantage they can, since that's natural. 

If you stick to your guns and don't help, they'll learn and forgive you probably quite quickly. Hopefully instantly, but yknow how people are sometimes."
ccj26s,"ESH. Her for not being professional about it- she should have just asked if there was a particular thing wrong with it (was it dry, was it not what you expected, etc).

You for believing that this is how restaurants work. Unless there is something actually wrong with the food you generally have to pay for it."
ccj2h8,NTA. Edgelords are inherently assholes.
ccj2u2,"NTA - she told you to look, to dump the bags, etc. If she can't keep track of her own shit it's pretty childish to get mad when someone else can't find her stuff."
ccj8qz,"NTA, she's being a child."
ccjc7c,"NTA: Lesbian here, you didn't hijack anything, you did what you had to to make a creep fuck off."
ccjdn1,"NAH. Both relationships are important, and you are making a great effort in both. Just talk to both your grandmother and friend beforehand to let them know you won’t be able to attend the entire time."
ccjiiv,"it'd be a cold day in hell before I ""apologized"" to someone who threw a tantrum like that.

NTA"
ccjiss,[deleted]
ccjiuv,"NAH- except your mom, of course. Constantly being compared to a sibling is shitty; having to hear that sibling defend you is somehow 10x worse."
ccjiy9,"NTA. She can get a different babysitter! And plus she didn't pay you for your babysitting, which is really shitty of a ""friend"" to do."
ccjlja,NTA - obviously you hit a nerve. The way he reacted to you calling him an alcoholic is the textbook response from an actual alcoholic.
ccjpvu,"NTA. Cut that shit loose.

Best wishes my friend. Hope things get better without someone bringing you down constantly in life."
ccjqno,"NAH. It's definitely kind of a weird thing to tell a student. I can see why it makes you uncomfortable. But honestly, it seems like she's still dealing with trauma so just let it go."
ccjr1p,YTA.   That’s... not how your supposed to negotiate your salary.    Why didn’t you do your research before asking before a specific amount?
ccjw9j,YTA. You're being too anal about the whole thing
ccjwfg,YTA. You should be one of those child pageant judges.
ccjwid,"NTA for not wanting to go, but YTA for preventing the rest of your family from going. Your phobias are genuine but irrational. Enjoy a staycation without the kids and let the others have fun."
ccjxfc,"NTA - the sale price was already cheap. You didn’t make money off your friend because he would have paid the same amount if he had found the house on his own. You took money from the developer’s pocket, not your friend’s, and the developer was alright with that."
cck016,"Plot twist: Invite Glen to your 40th birthday party so that he can’t go to his surprise.

NTA.

Edit: Wow thank you for the high praise (and Silver) kind strangers! You’ve made my day hehe."
cck2tg,[deleted]
cck35k,NTA — He is a textbook definition of an intolerant homophobe
cck5zk,NTA. Your stepdad kind of sounds like a psycho and his reasoning makes no sense. Where is your mom in all this?
cck7vg,First how old are you? If you're under 17 that can be considered child abuse. She doesnt sound like she cares much and that's inappropriate
cck859,YTA for throwing the BPD thing back at her
cck8rl,"NTA, why was he touching your property without your permission?"
cckc6q,NTA - and keep him away from your dates.
cckcwt,NTA - you live there too.
cckdib,NTA your neighbor sounds a little nuts.  Ignore her.
cckfqj,NTA. You have to work and they were being extremely inconsiderate
cckinr,Annnnnnnnnnnnd he sent me a dick pic. Wow that made it a lot easier. No longer care if I'm TA.
cckjm1,This is... really impressive. But YTA for lying and teaching him that validation from strangers even matters in the first place.
cckk23,NTA.  Just remove your trashcan completely. Use your trip to the hallway as a stretch.  She sounds lazy and entitled.
cckmi6,"YTA I don't care how confident you thought she was feeling, i don't know a single girl that would be happy to have their boob ""pop"" out of their swimsuit. If she was feeling confident before it happened, she definitely wasn't in that moment, and you made her feel so much worse."
cckn95,"NTA - Gary doesn't work at the store, and did something at first because he wanted to, but Jill is creating an environment that isn't good for business. I would talk to Jill first and see if she even realizes what she is doing, but if she continues, absolutely take it to a higher-up."
cckq70,"We get this every single day. ""Am I an asshole for cutting toxic people out of my life?"" 

NO. NTA."
cckt1g,"YTA, and your joke wasn’t funny at all. Pot meet kettle."
cckvcw,[deleted]
cckxsm,NTA -good luck. Never loan money with the expectation you're going to get it back.
cckycd,"NTA

are you sure your family thinks you're a pedo? sounds like maybe they just don't want her sticking to you all the time and annoying you. I know my parents would sometimes pull me aside and tell me to stop bothering an older family member I liked because I was being annoying lol. maybe try talking to them and letting them know she's not bothering you?

at any rate, you're not being inappropriate."
cckz9i,"Definitely NTA, but it kinda seems like they just didn't want to come see the play"

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
ccl4an,"NTA - Planning to settle down and start popping out kids at barely a year in is some wild shit. ESPECIALLY if you weren’t all that in to the idea of having kids before.

Also he had plenty of time to tell you before - bringing it up night before departure is manipulative and a red flag."
ccl505,[deleted]
ccl561,NTA. He's only five. Trust me when I say this: becoming part of his life *now* will be so much easier than waiting to do so down the road.
ccl5gl,NTA if you warn her and give her an official deadline
ccl6xz,"NTA. I know it sounds petty, but I wouldn't even give the old tent to him.

1. He completely ignored the calendar (and multiple reminders) and told his friend to book a flight immediately.

2. Refused to cancel the plans when finally realizing family was gonna come in

3. Refused to make other travel arrangements to camp once you were free again (and giving a poor excuse, 3 people in the back is cramped but certainly doable)"
cclb9a,NAH. Kids are weird.
ccldn3,"NTA. This is a you thing and a him thing. She’s got no right to insert herself on something with such sentimental value. I suggest sitting her down and fully explaining, and if she doesn’t understand, then idk man. Shit outta luck."
ccleml,"NTA, however it can be considered insensitive to include information/disorders that are not portrayed accurately. If the disorder is character relevant, then keep it. But if it's not, you could be furthering negative stereotypes and it isn't really necessary as a driving force. As someone with severe OCD, I wouldn't want someone defining me by it. But it does explain certain characteristics about me."
cclemt,"I don't know if you drive much or know how much gas is worth, so let me see if I can help put things into perspective. I have a fairly economic car, not a hybrid or anything but it gets a good 28+ on average. I have a 25 minute drive to work, five days a week, plus assorted other activities. I put MAYBE $30 in the tank every other week, on payday. If she wants even $5 per day, she's still ripping you off for a trip that's on the way. 

NTA. She's taking advantage of you."
cclg3k,"Next time she forgets, don’t meet her the next day unless she comes to where you are at a time you are convenient."
cclgab,"NTA.  It is incredibly poor taste (possibly illegal) to keep spoils of war as personal souvenirs.  Regardless of legality, if your great grandma wanted your family to keep any other stolen materials, regardless of the circumstances of their theft, it would be wrong.  Im not trying to judge your great-grandfather, things are done in wars, but it is your families responsibility to make such things right where possible.

My grandfather also served and I guarantee he'd say the same thing."
cclhle,"YTA for buying a dog as a gift for someone who wasn't prepared to raise one.  Saying ""I want a dog"" is not the same as saying ""I'm ready to have a dog.""

Also YTA for calling your girlfriend a bitch.  Break up with her if you hate her so much."
cclkq4,"NTA - you care about your friend which is awesome. May be worth trying to offer some practical support as well. Invite her around for dinner. ""Loan"" her a pair of jeans (if you're a similar size). Stuff like that. That way if she ever does get upset at you reporting her mum you'll have lots of ways to show her it was because you cared."
ccltik,NAH. You're not an asshole for wanting your wedding to be exactly the way you and your future wife envision it and they're not assholes for not wanting to wear tuxedos. I'm a guy who doesn't wear women's clothing and I can't say I'd be super comfortable being photographed in a dress. I hope you guys sort everything out and have the best day of your lives. Congratulations.
ccltz1,"NTA: that is a huge price change and his not wanting to show you is super suspicious. He literally bought 2 tickets and charged you for both since $85 x 2 is $170. If he is going to the concert as well, he is trying to make you pay for his ticket."
cclvro,"NTA.

You can call a cat shit for short and late for dinner, and it's not gonna care as long as it gets the scritches."
cclxi3,Yta. Part of being a decent employee is following company policies and procedures. You’re going to get fired and you have nobody to blame but yourself.
cclytg,"YTA: you let your girlfriend...of four years...whom you have a kid with... cosign a loan on a car, but didn't think she'd want to drive it, and think it's unreasonable that she'd ask?  You are DEFINITELY being unreasonable.  She is taking just as much risk as you and is also the mother of your child for fuck's sake. I mean shit, depending on where you live,  you're basically married by common law.  Grow the fuck up."
ccm0lx,"NTA and you would have been if you had saved it for him. Heck, even if you knew him, that would be questionable in a situation where everyone is scrambling for seats."
ccm957,YTA. This guy is doing nothing more than providing excellent customer service. To ask him to pretend not to know you makes you sound like a real asshole who doesn’t appreciate the fact that he’s providing you with such excellent service.
ccmaeu,"Everyone close to you is calling you the asshole and taking her side and you don’t even know what the issue was?  I find this extremely unlikely if this many people are taking her side over yours. They apparently know what her justification was, and I bet you do too. You haven’t let her tell you, but also haven’t even asked any of the family members taking her side?   Right....  YTA for either getting angry without at least hearing what the reason was, or for misleading this board by pretending you didn’t know to make the story seem better."
ccmb2m,"ESH - you're disregarding the signs that say to keep pets off the grass.  You should probably respect them, and when they told you to take heed of the signs you made excuses rather than just apologizing and moving on.


That said they shouldn't have called you a faggot so they suck too."
ccmc12,"Oh, man. What a mess. Sorry, I know you meant well, but you can’t greet your coworkers like that. If I was a new employee I would feel very uncomfortable being greeted as “beautiful,” especially if I didn’t know you did that to all the employees.

YTA

(I struggled with whether coworker was also TA, but I think I’d need to know more details to fully judge whether or not she overreacted)"
ccmcmi,"1. Pansexuality isn't a mental illness

2. Actual mental illnesses can happen at any age"
ccmely,"NTA - you're right in that if I told my mom something and asked her to not tell my dad and she went on to tell him, I would be reluctant to open up to her again. If your husband wants to be in the loop with regards to your son, he needs to work on developing a relationship with B wherein B feels comfortable opening up to your husband. It's not on you to create that rapport."
ccmgaa,"NTA

Why the fuck do your friends care about how you store your cleaning supplies. Your place, your rules."
ccmh94,"NTA.

Your grandparents even offered to help. It's her problem she can't and won't make the obvious decision which benefits both your siblings, you, and your mother."
ccmhse,NTA. Might as well save time if you know you’re not interested. Just don’t tell anyone why.
ccmidk,NTA. You're friend sounds like a dick.
ccmjc2,"NTA. You were plenty calm; I would’ve probably been a lot more mean about it. Stone’s a dick.

Btw your English is pretty good."
ccmkgb,YTA. That's a bad assumption to make. You should assume you're paying for a ticket unless otherwise specified; or at least offer.
ccmm2w,"NAH. It doesn’t really seem like either of you are being assholes, just used to living in different ways. You both seem to be very civil about this, and that’s good. You’re moreso in the right because you’re just trying to keep the place clean and the subleasers happy. Just try to come to a compromise and not start off conversations with how messy the place is."
ccmndj,"NTA

The fact that you can't tell them apart suggests that either your mother needs to find a better method to deliver such jokes, or at least find a way to differentiate between joke and critique. Your mother is an asshole however for shrugging off your concerns telling you that you can't take a joke."
ccmqta,"As someone in the medical profession, positive and negative results are not always 100% accurate. In addition, depending on the std, it can remain dormant for years. So I wouldn't get too worked up about it."
ccmv4v,"NAH, it's your wedding. I also don't think your mom is an asshole cause she did offer to pay and did not make a scene when you said no."
ccmxyf,"YTA

If you don't trust her, figure out how to work that out, don't double down on the distrust and insist on violating her privacy."
ccmy5w,Hello Larry David. Will there be new seasons of curbyourenthusiasm?
ccmyc0,"YTA

> everyone in my family has prestigious educations and it makes us look bad 

Fuck what anyone else thinks, as long as it makes him happy, don't get in his way. He'll just resent you for it."
ccn05o,YTA becuase your friend isn't an uber. Like he said its car so his rules. He also told you the day before you were supposed to leave so you could have asked a family member or get an uber or taxi
ccn36h,"NTA

A text takes two seconds, he should have taken the two seconds to text you, rather than keeping you on the hook for ages waiting for a call. *You* could have made alternative plans if you'd known."
ccn43g,"NTA, you're paying for the service, so you get to decide who accesses it. Especially if it affects your school work."
ccn58i,"NTA.  Also you need to grow a bit more spine, you gave like 5 credible reasons why hosting would be inconvenient/impossible for you, that's the end of it."
ccn5e3,"NTA. You were not wrong, and your supervisor was wrong to write you up.  You might want to point out to her that this amounts to workplace discrimination on the grounds of religion. You also might want to contact your union representative or labour relations authority."
ccn808,NTA if your mom knows what your sister is doing and that he's married then mom is just enabling your sister's bad behavior and parenting.
ccn8ic,"NTA.  It's your graduation, you get to decide who can come and who can't.  From what you wrote, it sounds like your mom didn't give you much assistance (either financial or emotional) during university, so it doesn't make sense for her to attend your graduation."
ccn8jw,"ESH. You said it yourself, two wrongs don’t make a right."
ccn97w,"Mild ESH. That guy is a royal prick, but it's not a super good look to go around insulting strangers either, even if they do deserve it.

Though, tbh, If I'd been sitting nearby, I'd be glad you said something. You may be an asshole, but you're the asshole the rest of us sometimes hope for."
ccna47,"NAH, she just cares about you, and you love riding, plus, you improved your gear."
ccnebf,"NTA literally all 3 of your siblings are old enough to know how to feed themselves. Maybe find a happy medium though, sometimes cook if you’re up to it, if not tell your siblings to do it, everyone in that house is capable to cook or learn how to cook as it’s not like it’s rocket science"
ccnf19,NTA - pushing her exhibitionism kink onto you and your housemates without consent from *everyone* involved is a major asshole move.
ccng0z,NTA - just because he was trying to do something nice doesn't mean that you should eat his shite meal
ccni8s,"NAH  your mum sounds like she’s being a bit gross but she’s in her own house, let her live. 

Stop annoying her about it and put up with it until you leave home."
ccnldo,"NTA. As with any other conflict, however, it’s all I. The messaging. An honest respectful talk is better than keeping it in and snapping at him."
ccnlnx,ESH truly the definition of everyone sucking
ccnmhl,"NTA


To my knowledge a chocolate allergy needs the chocolate to be eaten, not inhaled. It's not like severe gluten or peanut allergies. I guess he could have a reaction if you hit him with the kit kat. But that dude was being a dick, and you're just a hungry apex predator trying to eat a fucking candy bar. Next time stand your ground, and make eye contact while you eat."
ccnnk8,"NTA  


As a bartender (I've been a bartender and a bar manager) your first responsibility is to your patrons safety. He started off acting aggressively. I would have kicked him out for that alone. No second chances with aggression in my book. But I see where you are coming from with wanting to avoid the confrontation so close to closing time. After the second incident you were 100% in the right to kick him out. He was warned, he was on thin ice, and he acted out anyways. He was violating boundaries and rules. Just because your patrons got celebrity awe doesn't mean he was safe to be in the bar. Your customers who didn't want him kicked out aren't responsible for the safety of the bar, its staff, or its customers. You are. You had to make a judgement call and in my opinion you made the right one."

You said you were busy, refused repeatedly, door knocker didn't leave. Maybe you didn't *need* to swear at him but if he goes through... four refusals, three of them very firm, then he's gotten a fuck of a lot worse. He's not going to remember that interaction at all.

ccnoes,"NAH. It’s absolutely fine to wait a few days until you know for sure. You’re not putting anything off or keeping things from him, you’re just waiting on results. There’s nothing he can do but panic and stress and wait for the results just like you’re doing.

Your wife sucks for kicking out a 14 year old child and then being surprised that that child feels neglected and has resentment as an adult. My suspicion is that if the behavioral problems were solved by moving in with the other parent, chances are your wife and you were a big part of the problem.

I also think it sounds like you and your wife hold on just as much resentment for SD as you claim she holds on to against you -- the difference is that she was a *child* when the behaviors happened and you were an *adult*. The child who was treated poorly by parents and lashed out is allowed to have resentment, the parents have less of a right to it.~~SD is a smaller asshole because she could've handled things with much more tact. There's no reason to send angry emails to your parents instead of picking up the phone or visiting to try to hash things out.~~ People don't estrange their parents without reason. I'm almost 100% certain now that those emails contained *exactly why you've been estranged/low contact*, but you're focusing on the tone to avoid taking responsibility.

Ultimately, you're the biggest asshole for getting involved the way that you did. You decided to pit SD against her sister (""if you acted more like your sister, we'd treat you better"" is pretty shitty), went behind your wife's back and ended her relationship with her oldest child, and just over all lacked tact.You didn't do the right thing. You severed a relationship instead of trying to repair it. I hope this all works out.

Edit: Sorry everyone who upvoted me, I've changed my mind from everyone sucks. This post reeks of narcissistic parenting now that I've read some more resources. Shoutout to [u/Fredo\_the\_ibex](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fredo_the_ibex) for sharing some great resources for how emotionally abusive parents view and talk about their estranged children.

Edit 2 for OP's edit:

""**My wife made some mistakes with SD and she feels very terrible about it. My only issue with SD is the way she treats my wife. She needs to deal with her anger on her own. It's not my nor my wife's responsibility to placate her, and my wife does not need to deal with her abusive emails.** ""

This could've been taken straight from a parents of estranged children forum. No accepting that your wife's ""mistakes"" (abuse, likely) are the *reason* she's estranged from the daughter. No admission that the child is reacting with anger \*because she's being gaslit and pitted against her sister, who is put on a pedestal.\*

**It is absolutely, unequivocally the responsibility of the parent who forced the child away to change behaviors and accept the child's emotions if they want a relationship with the child.**

I'm glad SD is now forging her own life away from her Nparent and the person who enables her.

ccu73m,NTA pets really shouldn’t be given as presents as they’re a huge commitment.

ccuj3m,"NTA. People have lives and literally cannot be with their phone 24/7. Well, assuming he doesn't want to listen to you peeing and pooing and stuff, not to mention many workplaces ban phone use while working. 

Thank god he wasn't alive in the 80s! How would he have coped with not being able to call anyone at any time!!! oh, the horror!"

ccuvk9,"NTA. You didn't ask for the laptop and he didn't tell you it wasn't anything other than a gift. Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.  


That being said, if you want to avoid an argument over the subject and to get the laptop you want (you don't seem to enjoy the one he gave you), maybe you can get him to return it? He gets his money back and you keep saving for the laptop you want. Win/win?"
ccuxng,"NTA. They should have given their family their order, that is the most that is acceptable in this situation. Cutting in line, especially once told not to, makes someone TA."

I wish you both the best. I’m currently going thru this issue with my overweight sister. Don’t give up!"
ccv2sf,"NTA. Being high while driving is definitely not okay. I don't think it's okay to be high at work or at family functions either, but this being reddit I accept that there may be differing opinions on that. It's not okay to drive or work under thr influence of alcohol, right? Or even certain medications.

You're right, weed isn't a big deal- think of it as beer that makes you hungry- but the way your sister is using it is irresponsible."

ccvmzp,"ESH. Cats aren't dogs, you can't really just ""train"" them not to sleep on the bed, particularly when they have had the run of the house for 17 months.  The reason the cat peed on the bed was to TELL YOU it had a bladder infection, not to piss you off. The cat was part of the deal and pets are for life, you don't just change your mind about them if you're a decent human being. So take some allergy pills and buy a cat bed for the living room and sprinkle it with catnip before you go to bed to entice the cat to stay there.  Be the bigger person."
ccvsoa,"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

So my extended family is having a wine party, and they left the young baby (1 y.o to 5 y.o) with me and my aunt to watch. My aunt went to bed early because she’s going through radiation now, so I asked the kids to stay quiet so she could sleep. They got a little too rowdy a few times so I again calmly asked them to be quiet. After about 20 minutes of them continuously not listening I finally had enough and raised my voice saying “that’s it! Time out now!” And I put them in time out. They cried a lot (of course, because they’re still babies essentially), and refused so I said “now! Or else no more tv!” They finally listened. But my aunt woke up and scolded me for being rude and saying I shouldn’t have yelled, and that I shouldve let their parents handle it (which they were NOT even with us)

I mean, it’s not like I cursed at them or even got physical spanking them. But AITA for how I handled it?

ccvtgt,"NTA. that's super inconsiderate. You basically drove an hour for nothing. He'd be pissed if the situation was reversed, I'm sure. 

Try inviting him over then 15 mins later tell him you have your period, don't feel great and he should leave. Bet he won't be pleased."
ccvtjl,NTA - block her and stay the heck out of it. This does not bode well.
ccvujx,"NTA  Just the power of attorney and financial stuff alone is more than what should be expected of you , especially given she has a son of her own.  You can walk away from ever seeing her again and still pat yourself on the back for being a good person because you make sure she is physically taken care of.

You need to take care of your own emotional needs and wellbeing."
ccvuwk,"NTA - I don't think this is for the relationship advice sub, I think it's for r/raisedbynarcissists. Your mother sabotaged your wife's livelihood and your life generally for an issue that wasn't her business -- even if she didn't know about the milk intolerance, as long as your child was being fed then it's not her place. When you're anxious to see your parents because you don't know what's going to offend them, they've set arbitrary standards and rules so that they can lash out at you for things you didn't know were a problem. The comment about the spit is downright abusive."
ccvz72,[deleted]
ccw0sk,NTA. You planned accordingly. The guy wanting to go to Philadelphia is the asshole. His schedule matches up with the majority of people going but he's deciding to be an obstacle.

Google 'namaste cultural appropriation' and you'll turn up a lot of articles, I just linked one of the most salient I found. I think you should go over to one of the Indian or Hindi subreddits and ask the people there, to be honest.

If the name were like 'nekogogo' or '¡Hola!gram', or based on other common words that don't have a cultural significance to the culture they're originally from, no one would really think about it, I think. But this one is a bit of a sticky issue already."

ccwl4o,NAH but you have to be very careful when you tell them—can you get a relative to tell them?
ccwmz0,"YTA - they obviously know their own dog and are capable of making appropriate decisions regarding it.  Not your pet, not your place, not your responsibility to say anything."
ccwohp,"I have multiple thoughts on this. 

First of all ... NTA. I loathe having fingers snapped at me - and I always tell people ""I'm not a dog, don't snap your fingers at me"". 

Next, I'm really sorry you got kicked out of the house. I don't think that's appropriate either. And it sounds like your brother is being taught to become an entitled, toxic, male asshole. 

That saying, I don't know how severe ""absolutely losing it"" is. I don't think you were an asshole even if you went full rage on him, but given the circumstances, it probably wasn't the wisest most mature thing to do."
ccwpt1,"NTA   It is appropriate in this situation to use Dr.

 She should have just made the correction.    
She is the one turning this into a huge deal.

ccwqm2,"YTA

ccwtvy,"NTA, ugh even if she gets up on time for the trip, she’s gonna be a nightmare to travel with..."
ccwu3g,"NAH because it fits the theme of your classroom and you didn’t specifically call this kid a monkey because he was black, but... it is a sensitive word to use, and if a parent heard their son being called a “monkey” with no context (or even context, some people just don’t like the word at all and rightfully so, they should be 100% respected and heard), it could be troublesome. Honestly, I’d just change it to Marvellous Macaws or whatever and avoid conflict."
ccwuc8,"I am more than 3x your age; I love Harry Potter, and my new favorite show is “Just Add Magic”, which I am pretty sure is for 8 year old girls whose parents have an Amazon Prime account. 

You’re not the asshole, and you can like whatever you want! Stay strong.

NTA 

Edited: wrong classification, sorry!"
ccwunc,"NTA-Hey, hon, this sounds really familiar to my personal experience. You aren’t alone, don’t let your feelings get dwindled down to “teenage angst” or whatever. This is all very valid and I’m sorry that you have this strained relationship with her. Maybe look into the subreddits about parenting, I’m pretty new but I saw one that had to deal with narcissistic parents, it might be able to help you navigate your life/relationship with her and to feel less sheltered."
ccwx5x,"Yes, YTA. Either apologize and move on or let it go and be nicer in the future."
ccwxpr,"NTA.  But I'm sorry, even if a dog knows the ""down"" command, it doesn't mean it will obey it from a stranger."
ccx18o,"NTA but let's be real. You're not mad at her about the surprise. You're mad at her because she's a shitty (or at least very clueless) friend. If anything, this is the last straw. Cut her off."
ccx4s4,">Also, please don’t say I’m acting entitled because we are well off so he could easily pay it off no problem.

This is the most entitled thing you said. 'we' aren't well off. He is. You did the damage to HIS car, you pay for the damage, either directly or by working it off as he asked.

YTA."
ccx70v,"Yta. You can have a terrible relationship with someone but that doesn’t mean they aren’t a good friend to someone else. You don’t get to decide who other people are friends with, regardless of your feelings on their choices."
ccx8nd,"YTA. He parents are divorcing, which would probably mess hugely with emotions and focus levels, and she’s ‘only’ working 2 part time jobs? 
If you push someone to study when they aren’t motivated for themselves it will never end well. I dropped out of uni cause I was pressured into it, thankfully no longer with the ex who pressured me into it for good reason. 
Let her have a break, best possible thing you could do!"
ccx8nw,"NAH - she's looking at it as ""you should love me for me, no matter what I look like - so a face tattoo shouldn't matter"".

You're looking at it as ""If you got a facial tattoo that would be so surprising and unexpected that I'd obviously would have to question whether or not I know you well enough to truly love you.""

Such discussions about hypotheticals tend to quickly degenerate because the actual question being debated by each of you isn't the same question."
ccxb8z,"NTA  


A said that you needed to invite yourself. But you did by saying that would like to hang out before she left. She's an asshole for not actually including you while you had shown intentions of wanting to be included."
ccxc4j,"YTA. Well intended, but that's a weird ass thing to do."
ccxfqa,"NTA. If she was dropping friends, you likely would’ve been dropped eventually, too. You were just speeding up the process and avoiding potential damage to yourself. I suggest reporting her behavior to authorities or the school or something, as what she’s doing seems sketchy at best. Where’s she finding these kids and why’s she talking to them?"
ccxgfk,"NAH. It’s not unreasonable for your family to want to spend time with you. It’s also not unreasonable for life to get in the way sometimes. I will say this, don’t let so much time go by that you regret not visiting when your grandparents were healthy and able to enjoy their time with you."
ccxgwd,"NTA. Remind them that you do far more than a regular Nanny and you were tired and legally and morally entitled to a day off. If they wanted you to work, they should have asked and offered to pay.

Families move every single day and don't have a nanny or anyone to watch the kids. She's not hard done by because she had to look after her own kids for one day during a voluntary move."
ccxhbo,"NTA but I remember being out playing that late at night during the summer.  Part of the glory of summer (but not on other peoples' porches).

Get a loud box fan for the bedrooms.  Glorious glorious white noise."

ccxm3n,"It's been 8 or 9 months of this, and it's almost every single day something happens.  At least once or twice a week she has yelled at either me, another manager or a customer.  I've also been written up based on her yelling at a customer.  I know this because the customer did the survey and the customer said I yelled at them, but it was her and they confused us because she told them she was a mnager.  Not sure if that changes your thoughts at all.  It's not a sudden jump to suing them, but it is pretty bad and I dread going to work now"
ccxm70,If you didn’t know the details of the situation and your boss already said he’d take care of it then it would have been much better to not get involved. In a lot of places this could be a potentially fireable offense.
ccxme2,"NTA. Your logic is pretty sound and well thought out, and it sounds like your husband is the one who's being (a little bit of) an asshole. Could you compromise and use it as a middle name?"
ccxn3s,ESH- she was a bad waitress but you need how to act like an adult in public. Grownups don’t slam their cups on tables to get attention.
ccxo3y,"With friends like you, who needs enemies? YTA

Let's try rephrasing your story: My colleague asked me to continue his part of the lottery buy-in while he's out of office and I agreed. This week he won. Can I keep his winnings, since he doesn't know about it, and I'm feeling petty about his absence?

If you do the moral thing and tell him he won, maybe he'd want to share with you."
ccxof6,"NTA. They close at 9 and you were in and out before then. 

If it was a sit down restaurant then maybe. But you’re good here!"
ccxpux,NTA but I don’t think you have enough evidence to call the police until something happens to your car. Take photos though and write down what has been said.
ccxq4p,"NAH

Honestly, the only person who can say if you're being an asshole or not is her. If she didn't want to help she should have said so."
ccxrdy,"**NTA**. If this can jeopardize your housing status, report it."
ccxxn2,"As long as you RSVP no, then you’re not TA for not attending. You may be throwing your friendship into a dumpster fire, but if that’s the bed you want to sleep in, you do you.

EDIT: for the record, she was probably avoiding “deep” conversations because she was emotionally exhausted from the wedding. They’re a pain."
ccxy5i,"NAH - It sucks, but I think you and your husband needed to always consider that debt as yours. What if his parents died suddenly, it would be on you guys anyways. 

Unless his parents forced him to go to school and accumulate so much debt, I don't see how it is ultimately their responsibility. Was your husband working while going to school? Why is his debt so high? 

It sucks they reneged their offer, but it was generous of them to pay any of it. Doesn't matter how much money they have, they owe you nothing.

You guys would be the assholes if you ask them to pay it."
ccxzax,NTA. You can't have a dog that attacks your kids or anyone else in the house and it sounds like you found him a home that suits him.
ccxzlq,"NAH, and you really can't go wrong with apologizing. He knew where your head and heart were prior, and didn't express any alternate wishes. But maybe he felt differently. Talk to him, no blame, just tell him what you told us!"
ccy0cw,"NTA - your kid, your rules.  When grandma has another kid she can take them to amusement parks without you all she wants!"
ccy0tx,Not gonna say you're the asshole but you're definitely a creep.
ccy109,YTA. This dude is unorganized as hell but you didn’t pay for the shoes. Don’t steal them. Make sure he gives you the full amount for shipping though.
ccy31d,"NTA, but you’re doing it wrong. 

You hold one big party and neither parents are invited. 

They can throw their own, and invite eachother if they’re going to be such babies. 

Shit, you could call it the Pity Party, even. 

(You can have that one for free)"
ccy3rt,"Ive communicated this and they plan it Sunday afternoon again.  I can't really not work Sunday without basically giving up something like a big portion of my food budget. Like I even found out that because I have to work today I essentially was missing out on a mini surprise birthday party for myself. I didn't have one on my birthday because I had one earlier in June to accommodate things important people in my life had going on.

But like I think I'll have to communicate it more harshly."
ccy41l,"Nah. I'm not exactly sure what to say other than, everyone has their preference and you not dating women who don't do it, is yours."
ccy4w7,NAH if you do it nicely. When people do this I usually say “oh yes you’ve told me about that! So crazy” so they stop. It’s just nicer than “yeah I know you’ve told me 100 times”

ccyia6,"NTA. Your lease starts the same day, right? Then it is fine. She's being weird."
ccyies,"YTA - Definitely. You admit you don't even know why you dislike her so much, and in fact, you have reasons to like her. She's a good-egg, and you dislike her because ??? You're not obligated to hang out with her, but your reasoning for not wanting to makes you the asshole. These people are inviting you to eat a meal with them, and you're declining because of some unconscious bias against her that has zero basis in reality.

Try opening your mind a little and you might make a lifelong friend, or at least making some happy memories for yourself."
ccyk0h,"NTA. As someone who recovered from a nasty heroin addiction, I'm telling you right now. She's not chosing him, she's chosing the drugs. If you want to give her the ultimatum still, that's fine. And justified. But this isn't about him. It's not about love, and missing him. She thinks it is, or she's convinced herself it is, but it isn't. This is common for us addicts. Say it'll be done and over in a week. Gonna tie some lose ends and move on. Goin to rehab in a month. Then it's time to go, time to stop, and excuse, excuse, excuse. I don't know which is worse, lying and saying to you it's about the boyfriend or the truth. She's choosing drugs over you, and I'm sorry to say that. I put drugs in front of some very important people in my life. I think you have to, at this point, put your ahead. Be selfish and chose your life as she is being selfish in choosing hers. It's a selfish disease, and it's her choice. NTA for making her choose."

DnD can be pretty complex, and if it's your first time playing you're probably going to struggle if everyone else treats you like you're already familiar with the game.  You have to be patient with new players.

Hope that car was worth it. Enjoy the key marks in the paint in about... 2 months."
cczyjo,"NTA. You guys didn't have plans or anything, and you were already in your jimmy jams. If she wanted to go she could have just asked nicely, or sweetened the deal by offering to pay for yours. 

Like maybe it would have been nice to do a final maccas run together before she leaves but you're not really tight or anything. So, whatever."
cczywm,"NTA. That's shit roomy behavior. Still, accusations never work, u gotta deal with it another way."
cd00mz,"Oh man. To be young again when this was the type of shit to worry about.

NTA. Your girlfriend is self-conscious. Reassure her and move on with your day and delete the photo.

Edit: realized it wasn't your girlfriend. Crop it. Post it. Ignore her. Ain't your problem.

I wouldn't have even deleted it, most likely."
cd03dm,"NTA. Start putting your foot down. You already feel bad about letting this woman into your home. These feelings will only grow unless there's some change. There are more options than just full on conflict and nothing. Maybe suggest redirecting the conversation if she's so opposed to the conflict route. Your GF should be sticking up for you, and vice versa."
cd05da,"YTA. 

That would be crossing a huge boundary, it's often very not good for anyone who works with people's information in any capacity to go around giving it out to anyone. Even pizza delivery people can't give out your address to anyone outside the store. For police, it can be super extra not good. 

Not saying that one wouldn't if you asked, people sometimes act dumb, but the asking should not happen

It would ok for you to ask about how to get these papers served without an address and see if they can give you any advice, guidance, or good contacts, but this can come across as asking for the address indirectly and look bad, so make that social judgement call.

/r/legaladvice may be able to help you with that info also, if you don't want to risk looking like you're trying to ask for the address indirectly."
cd0652,NTA. Sounds like your friends are selfish and obnoxious and lack basic social skills.
cd0akn,"NAH. 

She's your girlfriend and she cares about you. If she looks sad, it's probably because she's sad that you're hurting but really, no one's an asshole here at all."
cd0egu,"NTA. Your friend has a drinking problem and is clearly an unpleasant person to be around in those situations. You know what happens at people's 21st birthdays, so him getting wasted is a given. You mentioned him hurting himself when he got drunk and you left to keep from getting triggered yourself. You not going is doing what you need to keep yourself in a good place mentally. If he takes issue with it, he needs to realize his behavior when drunk is very off-putting and he needs to realize he has a problem. It's fine to have a few drinks. It's not fine to start drinking with the intention of getting wasted every time."
cd0gdl,"""You don't shit where you eat""

A lot of corporations frown on inter-office relationships. Keeping it secret is very wise for both of you. That said, she thinks you are not wanting others to know for a different reason. Talk to her. 

Also: hope you don't break up or work is gonna get real shitty real fast...

NAH."
cd0gjg,"NTA- Your entitled to your lunch and if she didn't call you then it's not your fault. To be honest it's childish of her to even complain knowing she didn't ask you for help, you can't read minds (you can't, right?) so you couldn't know she wanted your help."

cd0l7e,"YTA, I'm not sure why you say commit here, when you had one hook up, unless I'm missing something. But regardless, there's nothing wrong with not wanting anything more than a one night stand. But when someone wants more, you become the asshole by not telling them your intention."
cd0m54,"NAH. It’s understandable that you want some continuity when you’re the one living there. It’s also understandable that she wants to hold on to her room as she must enjoy living there. 

However, it’s unfair of her to expect you guys to live with randoms - she’s not the one there to deal with it after all."
cd0m5p,"ESH

If it's late (midnight or heck 4am!) I'm not going to get out of bed to ask 'politely' it's totally reasonable to expect a quick bang on the floor will remind you that you have neighbours and act a bit more responsibly, so you suck for being loud at that time of night, and not just saying sorry when called on it.

Then they suck for their reaction too."
cd0po8,"Of course YWBTA
Have you considered that the kids might look alike *because they are cousins*?"
cd0smi,"YTA

Your son is only 6 years old and he clearly already knows that you guys are drinking and smoking. You also clearly aren't even hiding the fact that you do these things in front of him since he raised his hand in class which makes me question just how close he is to the weed and smoke.  You might not be ""blowing the smoke in his face"" but if you're smoking inside he's getting second hand smoke which will give him all sorts of problems at that age. 

Grow up and stop acting liking teenagers. You have a kid now."

cd11lp,"NAH - Honestly, living within your monetary means is always a good idea. Your sister still gets to go out with her boyfriend and another friend, you're not going to ruin her night by being unable to go out with her this one time. Assuming you follow through with your promise and do something with her (less expensive, naturally), I honestly see no a-holes here. She gets two fun days instead of one, AND you get to celebrate her birthday still."
cd11sz,"NTA you need to look after yourself and your health. Your friend has seen you over the three days, it’s not like you bailed completely"
cd1fyq,ESH. Your wife shouldn’t be ‘forcing’ you to buy a house. But if you both are thinking of starting a family then yes you will need a new house. I think both you and your wife need to sit down and seriously discuss your future together.

cd1rpe,"NTA As someone who dated older men when I was far to young to do so, you’re a good friend. I wish I had a friend like you when I was that age.

cd1wcx,"What the dad sent you a text telling you to leave it in the past? 

&#x200B;

He has some nerve. Putting aside the fact that there was already an inherent imbalance in power with him being a professor and you being his student, the age difference between you two was almost a decade more than your age at the time. You were still a teenager. So double yuck. 

&#x200B;

I mean, it's unfortunate she found out in that way, but now she knows her dad's trash, I guess. I think if it were me, I'd see if there was a was that the university was informed if he still works there. I don't know where you live, or if that's legal or not, but it's morally reprehensible to me. Has your friend had no idea about her dad all this time, no new partner, nothing? Is he still hooking up with students or what?

cd1yhl,"ESH. You’re right your comment was a low blow and it sounds like you knew it would upset him before you said it. However,  he is being a giant baby, one disagreement or off putting comment is no reason to completely cut off a relationship."

cd2f5s,"NTA and I’m honestly shocked people here are defending this?? Unsolicited nudes are bad enough, they’re a form of sexual assault. If he whipped it out in front of you in real life everyone would agree he’s in the wrong, a photo you didn’t ask for is as close to that as it gets. 

The girl deserves to know if her boyfriend is trying to show off to other women. If my fiancé was sending photos to women I’d be furious, if they were unsolicited I’d be disgusted as well."

cd313t,">YTA, an entitled asshole, too young to realize that anyone in your family could disappear tomorrow.

To play the devil's advocate, from the sounds of it, they don't make it appealing. His siblings leave him out of these trips. The couples really could invite their brother along. The kid gets bored and feels left out, and is accused of ruining everything. Apparently he doesn't get along with his eldest sibling at all. It's true that some of it may be on him, but it sounds more like a vicious cycle.

What I would suggest is that if OP is comfortable, he suggests doing something with his siblings. A ""siblings lunch"" or something while they're in Florida. Are they going to be at Disney the whole time? If not, maybe OP can ask if he can opt out of that day (he's old enough to stay home by himself, perhaps find something else to do locally), but would very willingly participate in everything else. OP can also try expressing his concerns to his parents."
cd326f,"NTA, but you're right you could have handled it better"
cd33jg,"Gonna go with YTA. Your boyfriend has that dynamic with your parents because you’re all living in their house rent free with a baby at 28. You should be mindful of that. It sucks but bailing on him was messed up. Your basically saying “I won’t stand with you for not standing up to the people who are standing by us in a time of need”.

His parents almost for sure think you’re a dick for doing that, and now you put your bf in that situation. MOVE OUT, then maybe you can give him crap about not standing up to his parents."
cd36eu,"NTA. I had a friend who would do this. It's annoying because you're trying to be a good friend, but also tired of them not listening to you either. She knows he's bad for her, so why is she still hung up on him right? Just tell her how you feel in a civil way. Especially if she isn't even talking to you about what goes on in your life, and is only talking about hers. Sometimes we get too caught up in our own lives we don't realize how inconsiderate we are being."

My friend makes jewellery she sells on the street in this cute outdoor market. There are other jewellery sellers, and everything she made that sold well, would start being made and sold by other sellers shortly after. 

She got scared to be creative and put out new things, and eventually had to stop and become a dog walker, because it was so disheartening, and not lucrative enough anymore.

The assholes here are the girl's parents and grandparents, who apparently don't practice basic manners and haven't taught any to their kid either. If the little girl was gentle with your toys and only came over when you said it was okay, would that be acceptable to you? It is your stuff and ultimately you have the right to say no one else can touch it, but this little girl seems to look up to you and you could be a good influence! I know you don't want to create problems with your neighbors, but can you compromise with them about not letting their granddaughter come over without asking you first and have them help you explain to her that she needs to be gentle with your toys if she wants to be able to play with you?"
cd565h,"ESH - The will can be changed. It's your estate/inheritance to do with what you will. If you think he would just piss away the money, there's no point giving it to him. 

That being said, your attitude of totally giving up on your sixteen-year-old child does make you an asshole here. You're assuming that your daughter is the result of your actual parenting, but maybe she's succeeding *despite* your upbringing. Your son is your son, and acting as though he's going to amount to nothing and just throw his life away when he's not even an adult...well, you're helping to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. When your own father has already written you off, it's much harder to turn things around.

This isn't just someone who made a passing rude comment to you; this was damaging, intense verbal abuse for years. It's not just some petty high school drama; it's painful bigotry. The fact that the guy hasn't reached out to you to apologize now that he's interested in your sister, or at least told your sister he feels bad about it and intends to apologize, is very telling to me.

Everyone is just looking into their best interest here and it sucks that it's not a happy ending, but can't really fault any of the parties."
cd6wse,"YTA

Without knowing why you weren't added earlier, I can't really claim that the other people are assholes.  It's possible that the chat started as something very specific, and slowly evolved to be a more generic ""family chat"", and people eventually realized that you weren't on it.  Or not.  But I don't have enough information to make a call on that.

However, I *can* make the judgment about you being an asshole, because the whole ""silent treatment"" thing is super immature, and accomplishes nothing.  No one else knows why you're not responding, or even that you're upset to begin with.  So what is the expected outcome here?  How does you ignoring them fix anything?

This is some nonsense I'd expect from a high schooler, not someone who's almost 40.  If you're upset, either have an adult conversation and let them know that you feel hurt and ignored, or don't, and just deal with those negative emotions yourself.  But this type of immature response should be beneath you.

cd7fyh,"NTA. 

The best tactic here is going to be having a very short and sweet conversation with him. Not even a conversation. Just something like “hey Pops, you know I love you, but I need you to stop making any comments on my appearance, positive or negative. Ok? Great.” And then keep it pushing. It will be good practice for standing up for yourself in the future. And believe me, there are going to be a lot of situations where you have to assert yourself firmly but pleasantly.

If he says something in the future, just pretend like it was never said. Act as if the comments didn’t even occur. Move the conversation in another direction. If necessary, just stand up and calmly leave the room. Stick to it. Give him no reaction. Just simply, politely, refuse to discuss your appearance. 

It’s a mature way to handle the problem without going to Mom. If he persists, then you need to talk to mom."
cd7g0e,"NTA. I always make many efforts to help my friends who have gone down a dark path. But eventually you have to accept that you can’t help someone who does not want to be helped/won’t help themselves. If you see them starting to make changes in the future, reconnect then. But life has to start crashing down before most people will be willing to make the change."
cd7mhn,"NTA Under most circumstances I would say you're an asshole for not showing up for work, with almost zero notice. That's a huge pet peeve of mine; it really can screw over your boss and co-workers. Having said that, we all work to pay the bills and Job A sounds like a much better opportunity in the long run. I can't say that you are an asshole for pursuing a better opportunity that unfortunately came up last minute."
cd7nli,"NTA - she sounds very selfish.  She is introspective enough to understand what is ""right and healthy for her"" but clearly had no empathy for you.  She probably isn't ""right and healthy"" for you and I hope you find a patient and loving partner."
cd7o6z,"NTA, it was inappropriate and no doubt against their contract. I also highly doubt it would ruin his life."
cd7rsp,YWBTA. He should know she might have cheated (again) before moving to another country for her.
cd7vyz,"Dude. You are NTA. It’s your money. 29k in college debt is not that much. Live your life. You’ve only got one. If you pay off your daughter’s debt, she’ll be able to afford to take trips and have fun. While you’ll be stewing at home. She’s got way more years left on this planet than you do. I’m in your shoes too. Paying for my kids tuition. Almost done. But, I said state school only. 
Everyone has what they want. Your daughter has her prestigious degree. Your son has his fully paid tuition. Your wife has her car. And, YOU finally get your trip. 
GO on that trip. Enjoy this one life. That’s all"
cd7wlf,NTA Your time and talent are valuable and you alone determine when to give it away for free. Just say no and move on. She’s a mooch.

cd83ch,"NTA, an extension was appropriate and since they didn’t provide, leaving was also appropriate"

cd8chr,"I work at a grocery store, though you technically stole it, this is their fault. We get training to check the bottom of the cart. You’re not TA, they’re just lazy :P enjoy your free beers!

Edit: Damn didn’t expect to get such a reply. Very obviously stealing is wrong, but I feel like this largely lies on the shoulders of the cashier. Part of good customer service is making sure they don’t have to come back when you miss scanning items. OP should have mentioned it a second time though."
cd8ehd,"NTA.  You're not sitting at a ""priority seats"" 

There are lots of AH in this story though. The pregnant lady who thinks she is entitled to ANY seats on the train just coz she is pregnant. 

The few people around you that gave you disappointing look.  Why didn't they get up and offer her their seat?"
cd8f70,"I've never had a guy ask verbally if he could grab my boob. Usually it's a progression of kissing and then hands moving more and more into private areas. If you were just kissing and then went straight for the boob, I would say that would be a little abrupt and startling. Hands should slowly wander and gradually move into those territories. If I didn't want him touching me there, it was easy to know where things were going and stop it. So I guess YTA."
cd8fgp,"NAH 

But I would NEVER visit your house again."
cd8ft9,"NAH. It doesn't sound like there is much of a problem, unless this has actually caused a rift between your brother and his friend. In which case, remind your brother that you are an autonomous human being capable of making her own decisions."
cd8ftp,"NTA, I would definitely have a talk with your sister about all of this, family is a big red fucking line that she should not be allowed to cross."
cd8g8i,"Awkward. I dunno. As long as you're not doing it to get back at her, which it sounds like you're not, NAH. Be friends with who you wanna be friends with, nobody has the right to dictate that."
cd8gcv,"NAH. It’s reasonable for you to protect your work, but they might be generally concerned about where you’re sourcing things from since they are bones. I think the explanation you gave here would be the best answer going forward - “I did some research to find an ethical vendor online.” You don’t have to give specifics, and they’re reassured and now know to look things up online."
cd8hql,NTA. You have the right to not have images of yourself posted online without your consent
cd8icl,How do two year olds even have the dexterity to type? Amazing.
cd8jke,"NTA.

Gifts are not loans, she can't ask for it back.

But your father sucks as well for spouting your private business to his clients. Please tell him you will tell all your friends about his sex life and other private details, and then ask your friends to giggle next time they see him."
cd8k0l,ESH. Your brothers suck for taking advantage of your parents and you suck for being upset about it only because of how it affects you.
cd8l7y,"YTA. And a weirdo. Not allowing her to bring a strange man into your home would be a okay, also a lot safer. Telling her she can't have sex with the hookup you let her bring into your house is just creepy and weird."
cd8obk,[deleted]
cd8ouv,"NTA. I wouldn’t attack him and tell him that he’s being wasteful, but while you’re all making the list, calmly point out that last time you ordered such and such a thing, it didn’t get eaten - does he really want it again. As far as what he spends his own money on? Not your business."
cd8rt0,"YTa. I totally understand why you want to do this, but you’re lying and eventually he will find out and be hurt that you lied this whole time. Have another serious and honest conversation about the breakdown of things and let him make the decision for himself."
cd905s,NTA; I’m no expert on Chess etiquette but monopolizing the board just seems to be poor form. Is it an option to bring in a second board in the event there are other players with whom you could get a game going? That way you wouldn’t even necessarily have to deal with Kevin who clearly isn’t just going to let you play.  You could also try talking to him but I don’t know how well that would go.
cd90ko,NTA - poor bun.  I’d look into rehoming the bunny.
cd95dv,NTA. He can add more clothes but you can only get so naked.
cd96rj,"YWBTI (you would be the idiot). 

Why you guys don't actually just meet in person beforehand and try and talk about things like Big Grown Up Adults is beyond me. You don't need to torch a friendship over this. At the very least, try and all meet each other and work it out. She may find you a lot less threatening in person, as well.

Plenty of men and women the world over manage to have close friendships with each other while still being in a happy monogamous relationship."
cd9b6r,NTA. Sounds like a clever solution to the problem.
cd9ca5,"NTA - individual relationships persist after couples split. It can be tough to stomach, but it's reality."
cd9ikq,"YWBTA. Husband and vet are both right - your lack of commitment would be dooming this cat. The cat's behavior isn't normal, which means it can probably be fixed. It doesn't sound like you've dealt with it from a behavioral standpoint, just ruled out medical issues (which is a good thing)."
cd9iox,"NTA

You did exactly the right thing for the right reasons, if your story is complete."
cd9itq,"NAH. 

You just asked them for a favor and they didnt want to and you didnt take the hint when they didnt answer, which is why they were being sarcastic when you kept asking.

You just asked the wrong people for a favor. 
Maybe they wanted to swim too and not have to be responsible for someone else's things or be blamed if anything happened to them."
cd9ox1,"NTA; purchasing a house is one of the biggest purchases you may go through with in your whole life. Don't worry about them, they will sell the house eventually.

&#x200B;

 If you aren't 100% on board with the purchase,; trust your instincts, they are almost always right."
cd9p1i,NTA it’s ultimately your decision. Why did they forbid them? I highly doubt it just has to do with money.
cd9pit,"YTA

BTW, saying ""my child"" over and over again like that is obnoxious."
cd9sys,NTA. You have to do what’s best for you.
cd9xtf,"NTA. IMO, leaving baked goods out on the stove for extended periods of time without a note or anything means they're up for grabs.

Also, 70 dollars? Because you ate ONE brownie? Were these made from 14k solid gold and fabrige eggs?"
cd9yuw,"I'm getting a different take from this than several other commenters I feel.

&#x200B;

Based on what you said, and watching my sister go through the same bullshit, I get the impression this guy is romantically interested in you, and is terrible at showing it, or worse, trying to guilt you into a relationship.

&#x200B;

> I told him my boyfriend had been more affectionate lately and that I was  happy, to which he replied ""great, as for me nobody loves me"" 

This is definitely him wanting you to tell him you love him, or to be there for him, so to speak.

&#x200B;

> ""Am I not allowed to do something else while talking to you???"" to which he replied... ""... You are. Sry. Gonna sleep."" 

You were *supposed* to tell him. ""No, I'm the one who'se sorry! Please stay up, you'll have my undivided attention!""

&#x200B;

> then one minute later he added ""Good night"" with a few sads emoji and he  replied with sad emoji again after I wished him a good night back. 

He was still replying because he was still hoping you'd realize how sad he was/'you made him' and make it up with your attention and affection.

&#x200B;

Girls aren't the only ones that play stupid mindgames, whether boys realize it or not.

I get the feeling you guys are pretty young. If you're still living with your parents, try to talk to his mom about counseling. If not, encourage him to get some help, but chances are, what he's really hoping will happen is that you'll 'make him happy' by being his GF.

&#x200B;

If I'm right about all this, NTA, as he's trying to, realizing it or not, guilt you into a relationship, and that's annoying for anyone."
cd9zvh,NAH you are free to have any kind of wedding you'd like but understand that they may choose to opt out of your wedding
cda22j,"ESH-your parents for making this a thing, but dude come on. Your wife can’t go out of her way to publicly thank some family members and exclude the two people who paid what hundreds? Thousands? for the trip. And it was your pride that excluded them? She didn’t need to out you guys as broke, but even “and a huge thank you to Jim and Judy for making this trip possible for us!” would have sufficed."
cda369,"NTA. This is an unreasonably big request from her, ~~and lending money (ESPECIALLY this much) to friends is a great way to ruin friendships.~~"
cda69k,"NTA. You’re free to invite whomever you want to a party though in the future, I’d be more discrete so as to avoid hurting feelings."
cda71o,NTA. That’s a tough situation. The most I’d probably do is make a comment when the terrible mom isn’t around about her outfit being cute.
cda7hy,YTA you are making assumptions about your brother without the whole story. Proceeded to tell your parents about your assumptions and got him in trouble. All based on hearsay.
cdab6t,"I don't think you fully understand how bacteria multiplication and food safety works. It's not just lard and it's been left at room temperature for hours.

Shes has every right to not want to eat what you make in this manner.

You're not trying to make her to eat it.

NAH."
cdaes0,NTA.  Sounds like a good plan to me.
cdai1u,"NTA - even though it's her place, it's your birthday celebration and she should check before inviting people you know you have issues with. That said it's a bit shitty to everyone else to cancel an entire event because someone you don't like is coming. These people are, so long as your sister is in her relationship, essentially family. You can't fob them off without everyone feeling like you're being at least a bit of a dick about it.

Personally I'd still go and just be myself. If there's going to be a problem let them be the assholes who ruin someone elses birthday celebration rather than you being the one who cancelled because of your sisters in laws."
cdaimq,"NTA - it seems like you’re doing a pretty good job at compromising. You even suggest a reasonable alternative by using an Uber if she didn’t feel comfortable getting in a car with you. She’s taking this issue as a jab at her personally when that really isn’t the case.

Just make sure you communicate your intentions to her and you’re both on the same page"
cdak2q,"YTA - it’s literally NONE of your business to meddle in their personal lives. You forced them to talk to each other when they both clearly showed no interest in connecting.

Don’t stick your nose where it don’t belong. This has nothing to do with you by any means"
cdaksd,"NTA, it’s pretty rude to smoke in public as is, but adding the fact that weed is *very* pungent and can cause psychological effects even second hand, it’s crossing the line big time."
cdalgm,"NTA. It seems perfectly reasonable, not only is she slacking, but she lied as well to get out of work early. It seems pretty reasonable imo, but it’s only my opinion."
cdalxj,Nta lol that's a crack up i would have used rando potatoes aswell
cdamag,NTA take that vacation. You earned it!!!
cdamke,"NTA. To me, it's kind of like being a vegan. Eat what you want, but don't force others to do the same if it's not their lifestyle.

If you don't want to be with your girlfriend, then break up with her. Stringing her along while you pine after this other girl is shitty."
cdaw9z,NTA  you're fine dude. Adults can be jerk offs too.
cdawr8,"NAH - even though I understand why you would want to go on a trip with both your brother and dad, you do have to remember you were given a car (that’s not owed by you anyways) and only had one rule. However, you would be TA if you took it anyways knowing this rule."
cdax2c,"NAH. People make mistakes. 

Have you considered a paper log to document medication adherence? The goal would be to get to a point where you can be responsible for 100% of your own medications. For now though it's probably best to take some steps to ensure you don't overdose."
cdaxuk,"NTA i think you handle it all as well as you could. 

You partner is the A hole here tho. Its only been a week, talk with the guy about the things you don't like instead of jumping to kicking him out."
cdb00u,"NTA but you treated her like that and blocked her BEFORE getting all your stuff?  Hope that works out for you.

Also, has she always been like this or is this a personality change for her?  When elderly people start experiencing dementia their personalities often change for the worse."
cdb11t,"NTA if she used up your vegan margarine, she should’ve replaced it with the same kind. It was a jerk move on her part to use it up & then buy butter you couldn’t eat. Simple courtesy, imo."
cdb1x6,"YTA. This method of calling out a liar is completely inmature. Using Instagram comments to stir up trouble? Cut that ex-friend out of your life and move on. No need to sink down to that level and publicly hurt people who haven't even done anything to you (sister). 

Edit: Facebook --> Instagram."
cdb29n,YTA and you’re being a little petty. The kids mother would prefer that she watches them rather than a non-family member / baby sitter? Sounds like a valid request if your only time for date night is when you have your kids. That kinda stinks for your kids honestly.
cdb2ml,"ESH. It doesn’t sound like anyone here is being responsible in caring for this poor dog. That said, if you’d pay under normal circumstances and are only refusing to pay because you’re pissed about the dog, that’s really passive aggressive. Time to have a sit down about rules in dealing with pets and get on the same page."
cdb4vc,This is a huge one. Hate to punt but have you talked to your therapist about this?  What will this get you?  You’re enjoying your time with her now. Will this help your mental health to confront her?  Can’t judge.
cdb4vz,"NTA: he shouldn't have come after you like that.

But consider that you discussing your mental health might come across as complaining. If you talk about it a lot it will start to sound like you let it define you, and the complaining can get *very* draining - even to supportive friends.

So be careful - you don't want to become a one note song."
cdb6qy,NTA: It is yours but its kind to think of your brother in this situation; maybe work something out with him being able to borrow it when you know you either don't have time for it or will be too busy with school to play it.

cdbk6x,Hmmm. This is a hard one. I’m gonna have to go with NAH. Although your fiancé is taking this too far by threatening to leave you. Not everyone wants to live with their in laws. Your mother is sick. That is self explanatory on why you want her to stay.

cdcfb4,"NTA.

Have you ever had a talk with him about his ""humor""? If not, this may be the time. It's one thing if you two can joke around with each other like that, but if your fiance is this uncomfortable, it's time to address it. He'll either learn how to read the crowd, so to speak, or he'll be a dick about it. Either way, you'll know where you stand with him and his level of respect.

Should he genuinely want to apologize for his behavior, cool...but it doesn't mean your lady will/should have to accept it. She's already tried middle ground and coexisting peacefully.

Kudos for putting her first. :)"

cdcir8,"NTA this same situation happened to me. I am not a smoker, my mom was. I hated that my mom would smoke while driving her kids in the car (us) and only have the window down a crack. When I got older and had kids of my own, I told her basically the same thing, that she is her own person and can do what she wants, but I don’t want that to be around my daughter (I only had one kid at that time). I told her in a nice way that I would like her to shower and change before picking up my daughter. Perhaps she could not smoke that day while she was with us and do all her smoking at home. I got luckily because my mom understood and also considered that to be way too much hassle so she quit smoking. That daughter is now almost 13 and she still doesn’t smoke."
cdck1y,You guys agreed breaking the window was a good idea so yeah you own half of that dumb decision YTA here.

What? Because people can't make changes to their lives that they think will increase their happiness just because they're old? 

>and she wants 50% of everything

Their lives, including finances, were completely intertwined for the last how many decades. Even if your mom stayed at home, she probably ran the household and raised the kids. What do you think is a fair split? 

> his life for the past years were Netflix, goats,feed store and gardening that's all he lives for and he doesn't know what he will do if he cant do any of his hobbies. 

So your mom can't leave because then your dad won't get the life he ""deserves"", in your mind. 

>My mom she has been hanging around so coworkers who we think influenced her into this since they are literally half her age and she talks bad about my father 

So your mom doesn't have the capacity to make her own decisions, and was easily persuaded by these evil women. 

I don't even know where to start with you, man. These are both your parents but you're treating the situation like only your dad exists and only his happiness matters."

He's not your friend. He's too much of a coward to say so himself so himself."
cde16p,"NAH. But you fucked up. This was a rookie mistake, and I'm sad to see it. 

If you tell your girlfriend about a sex dream you had, tell her it's about a celebrity or her."
cde28h,"NTA that guy sounds like an abusive monster. If she really wants to go she can go alone, fine. But fuck that guy."
cde31w,"As a ethical Vegan myself, and I completely understand your perspective I must say YTA in this situation, the biggest issue with the vegan community is forcing our belief system on others. Think of it like religion ..forcing their religion onto others that's not okay. So, your parents are trying to do something  nice for you and they will have vegan options I'm sure because they raise someone with a strong moral background. But we as a community we need to stop forcing our beliefs on others, we can help inform people and the best way to do that is not to judge them but rather educate. So, let your parents have their BBQ and help them prepare vegan alternatives, for the quest ...heck make a game out of it ..guess the vegan options ...treat is as an opportunity instead of an obstacle."
cde6nf,"YTA kids look forward to summer because they bust their ass all year to get good grades and please their parents. They get 2 months to relax and be a kid. You’re robbing your kid of their childhood, if his dream pans out great if not then he’ll have other opportunities but would you rather him look back in 10 years and say he remembered the summer he played games with his friends and had fun or slaved over more schoolwork and stressed."
cdedh4,"NTA

Gotta love people like that who come down from the hills after a tragedy to shoot the survivors."
cdei9w,NTA and it’s worth noting that you were technically groomed by this older man
cdeium,YTA. I get your point but you sound like an elitist.
cdelxa,"NTA. If you're considering going no contact, I assume there's something deeply wrong with your relationship and you're not obligated to tell her. 

That being said, prepare for a shitstorm when she finds out you're pregnant."
cdem7z,NTA fuck him and fuck your mother for letting that happen to you. Special place in hell for parents that put their romantic interests ahead of their children's wellbeing.
cdenfr,"YWBTA - It's possible she's bi, or figuring things out. She's not taking anything away from you by experimenting. You can talk with her about sexuality (it sounds like she'd really appreciate that). But don't approach her on this to police her about her own identity when it's probably a really fluid thing for her right now."
cdeo2m,"Hehe **NTA**

I did this a few times around the 20-25 week awkward bump mark of my pregnancy. I work with teenagers though so I would often relent after a few seconds of awkward silence/stuttering and say 

""I'm just kidding. I *am* pregnant. But it would have been really awkward if I wasn't right? In the future, wait until a woman brings up her pregnancy with you before you mention it or ask about it :)""

Those women could have probably used a moment like that when they were younger."
cdeoch,NTA. He can look away and ignore it if he choose too. If not your fault his religion forbids something like that.
cdesfj,"NTA - He left this to you for a reason, hes obviously thought it out enough that his ex wife hasnt been left anything and the kids taken care of with his assets.

He done it for whatever reason but now alot comes down to you with what you do with your younger brother etc but don't let your parents guilt you into something you don't think he would do.. out of everyone its been left to you whether it's for good judgment or other reasons"
cdezks,"NAH. It was clearly a misunderstanding, and the waiter sounded confused. Not your fault, and a genuine mistake on the restaurant's part. I think the way you handled it was fine."
cdezup,NTA. Your mom should respect your feelings and try to accommodate instead of treating you like a nuisance.
cdf0s8,"YTA. Being honked at is pretty frightening when you're just learning, especially if you're going at speed. Half a km is not a long time, and you could have been patient. Your GF is right - they're just learning, be nice."
cdf1z4,"NAH. Not only would donating seriously hamper your career, kidney donation may actually be dangerous long term in general... that being said obviously your family are not assholes for wanting you to check your suitability. His parents obviously would put him first."
cdf3sk,"Nta

If they don't want to solve their problems then why should you care."

cdfkxx,"NTA, you aren’t an asshole for being annoyed. But it’s also not really any of your business who your grandma chooses to help."
cdfmul,"YTA. Imagine if it was your phone and some random creep is going through your info? 


It’s like if you left your front door open and a passer by saw it and closed it, but first they went in and looked through all your stuff, just because they could."
cdfnfs,"NTA. It’s tragic but after a while there’s only so much being someone’s emotional sponge you can do. If the problems are that clear and they spend a year and a half not dealing with it, you’ve a right to back off."
cdfo8m,"YTA. Don’t talk about your sex life in public with your buddy and certainly not in earshot of your ex.  Your gf was likely super embarrassed and found it easier to end things rather than stay with someone who has so little respect for her.

Edit: someone pointed out it wasn’t in earshot if his ex, just in front of someone who knows his ex. It doesn’t matter who overheard, he was complaining about his sex life (and disparaging his partner no less) with someone who wasn’t his partner.  OP is still TA.  ¯ \_(ツ)_/¯"
cdfoc1,NTA. This kind of stuff can kill a marriage.
cdfohe,NTA she is not your responsibility.
cdfwwb,"NTA


SIL is a puritanical weirdo. It's absolutely normal to wear a bikini at the beach. If her kids are going to be so damaged by seeing someone in normal swimming attire, then she should be keep them inside and out of 'harm's' way."

cdg2yf,"NTA

You're not the cheater.

Tell her. 

FYI, you can get STDs from blowjobs. Get tested."
cdg4mk,"ESH. First of all, this isn't actually about the salad. This is about her feeling like she did more work, which she did (let's face it, even the laziest chicken parm is more work than throwing a few olives in a bowl and tearing a few pièces of lettuce). I can't believe you initially wanted her to Cook dinner AND clean up.

But instead of discussingthis like adults, you both got passive-aggressive and défensive. Sit down and talk about it."
cdg7tg,"YTA.  If you don’t like the coffee, don’t buy it.   But don’t repeatedly buy it and then complain about it like an ass. 

Also, coffee is supposed to be bitter."
cdg9zv,"NTA. Holy shit though. You are 22? Now to an extent they are right, their house their rules, but that idea usually comes with very fair give and take . usually its more like, you wont bring a romantic partner into your room or we watch the news every night, or you WILL be home for family finner nights. Not total control. Sounds like You should focus on getting a job and moving out."
cdgaec,"ESH, a teacher should not be swayed into changing a grade by food gifts (pilaf & solyanka), and you should not suck up to a teacher by bringing them food.
Making small talk in his language is fine, though."
cdgcvt,"NTA, your parents should help you out as much as your siblings. Not okay of them to have favourites. 

Are you the eldest? This often is the reason behind your parents having your back the least."
cdghfj,"NAH. Honestly I wouldn’t tell them that the reason is because you actively dislike their partner. I would just let them know it’s a really small ceremony with a tight budget and since you’re not personally close to his partner, you’d prefer if he came solo."
cdgiio,NTA. I've heard that in some parks the staff will walk them out to the front gates because they dont want fights to start.
cdgizz,"NTA.

""Yeah, we'll just not be visiting anymore..."""
cdgovu,NTA you shouldn’t be guilt-tripped into buying a car.
cdgste,"NTA

Have I got this right?

A woman comes to you in distress because she's lost her children. You help her find them. She wants to go do something by herself and leaves the children with you. She's gone for an hour.

She comes in a week later and has lost her children again? WTF?! Seriously?! Same woman, same store? She asks you to help her look for them. You refused?

To be honest you should've just taken the children to security the first time and told them that their mother abandoned these kids with you **after** losing them already.

What is she away doing that she can't bring her kids with her? And why does she keep losing them?"
cdguky,"YTA She’s the one delivering the baby and if she wants her mother there, then you shouldn’t make a big deal about it."
cdgun8,"NTA - do not tell her. She’s not ready to be out yet and her partner is probably her only safe space where she’s comfortable with that part of herself. You have nothing at all to feel guilty about, but if you do you should talk about it with S. What benefit would there be in telling her?"
cdh73n,If you loved this cat why has it taken you *a couple of years* to consider calling the police?!
cdh7rs,NTA. You work he doesn't he can sleep all day. He can make a little bit of sacrifice since you bring the bread home. Make him wear an eye mask.
cdhdet,"NTA - Maybe he doesn't know her life, but his words were not ban-worthy she could have clarified her stance instead of abusing her power as moderator.

If you think you were too harsh, you could allow her back but take away mod privileges so she can't be trigger-happy every time her feelings get hurt."
cdhduz,"NAH. 

Next time save your energy and say you'll pass the feedback on. It works on a fair amount of people who complain about things that you can't fix. SOme will still want to complain more."
cdhgui,Edit: YTA -  You wouldn't be hurting now if you hadn't breached your fathers privacy.
cdhjg7,"NAH. I think Sam is just trying to do what she can for your family, and she unintentionally has gone too far.  By what you’re post is suggesting though, at this point it seems almost obsessive. Tell Sam that she’s crossed some boundaries of being an aunt and back off."
cdhjhb,YTA. Your friend can hangout with other people and have plans that don't include you. Find other friends to hangout with yourself.

cdhyai,"NTA but that boss is a giant one. You don't discipline employees in the open, especially not in front of customers."
cdi0ax,NTA you’re working your ass off and need a break. You being sick is cause you’re overworking yourself. One day staying home and relaxing to take care of yourself is alright your dad should be thankful for everything you’ve done for him.

cdi4k8,NTA - it's her dress. End of story.

cdijeq,"NTA


As a Brit, I feel fairly well qualified to judge the etiquette and nuance of queueing. It's our national sport. 


If she had her stuff on the conveyor belt, then I'd be slightly more on her side, (sometimes you've got to duck out of the line to grab something you've missed and that's fair enough), but a full trolley in the queue doesn't constitute having 'dibs' on a position.


Right, now for a cup of tea and a crumpet."
cdikfj,"NAH. Don't blame your girlfriend for being frustrated, but you've got a phobia, and it's not like it's a huge sacrifice to not go whale watching together. (You're also 100% right about the high likelihood that you won't see whales on a whale watching tour.)"
cdinxh,"Please don't edit this, because sprinkles break sounds very fun."
cdiuct,"NTA but it's your parents role to protect her. I Heard that there are a lot of pedophiles on tiktok so I hope she doesn't post anything. Even if she doesn't, bring exposed to this can't be good. Hope you can talk to your parents and they so smthg about it"
cdiv43,"“What? No, I didn’t do that. Didn’t you say your intern would do it?”"
cdiv6y,NTA- It sounds like your family needs to be helpful and supportive and not shame you over everything you do when it comes to food. I think you handled it well considering you've been dealing with the comments since middle school.
cdiv7g,"YOU ARE NTA, EITHER WAY.

You are trying to make the best out of a bad situation, and from your post it doesn't really sound like she is a bad mother except this thing of course. Get the child back home and social services or whatever will take care of the kid and will do checks on the family if it is working out.

&#x200B;

You are an angel for doing this after not seeing them for 8 years. You have my respect as a human being and the world would be a lot better if there were more people like you."
cdivul,"NTA.

Put out a collection box next to your snacks.

Tell your wife to stop baking for these ingrates."

Also, I strongly recommend you speak to your doctor about the severity of your symptoms."
cdj0f4,"YWBTA if you present your case in any manner which you posted this. They're children and you're an adult. Get some rest, ring the bell, and *politely* let the parent know you've heard the child shouting at an early hour. 

Keep in mind that even road projects can begin at 7am, so it's not as if it's the most unreasonable hour for the world to be awake."
cdj0sm,NTA. You've only been seeing each other for a short time and you made plans with a friend. She shouldn't be upset with you.
cdj8wk,"I am amazed that we have come to a point in history and society, where you can't express that you like something about someone you're dating,  because if you do, you're an asshole and a racist."
cdjd8i,"He’s mad at you because he didn’t get to order it himself? Just to be clear. Not that what was ordered was wrong, just that I wanted to speak it myself, I didn’t get to speak out loud to the waitress?"
cdjdfr,NTA. If they're pushing someone else back that person is likely in the exact same spot as you. They wouldn't offer to push an urgent surgery back for you
cdjf0z,"YTA, yes this would be rude. It sends a message that says ""I am too creative and unique to be restrained by the rules like all the rest of you."" It is also rude to the instructor by undermining their teaching. I realize that's not your intention, but that's absolutely the message it sends. There's plenty of wiggle room to add individual touches/style without completely departing from the guide image."
cdjfkn," >Now I am stuck with a moral issue on if I am okay with dating some one who is fine with this

cdjkcw,"NTA. To me, this is the same as finding money on the ground. Unless it's a large amount and I know and trust the business I'm in, I don't bother turning it in to Lost and Found, 'cos you know that's just going straight in someone's pocket."
cdjmii,"NAH: She's allowed to reject your advances, and you're allowed to stop speaking to essentially strangers for any reason you want."
cdjn2q,"NTA, what kind of friends can’t go a few hours without some drinks at the request of the host? Sounds shitty of them."
cdjokx,"NTA. You're allowed to stay mad at someone who so selfishly threw your life into chaos, especially since you're still dealing with the fallout. Her apologies can't fix that. She continues to affect your well-being by giving you shit about taking doctor-prescribed medications for actual medical conditions. She hasn't even begun to earn your trust back."

Dude it’s really no big deal you forgot, but you did make it a point that you remember. This person is still upset about it tho, WEEKS later ? That’s just ridiculous."
cdjstx,"House and apartment hunting is tough work. If your friend is getting a free ride leaving most of the arrangements to you I think it's ok to tell them you're going to see about getting somewhere by yourself. I don't think you're going to fall out over this. Also, if you're doing all the work now you're probably going to be left doing all the work regarding the sorting bills and stuff as well. Good friends doesn't mean they'll be good housemates. I think you're good, you can just break it to them that you've found a great place and you're going to go it alone."
cdjtj4,NTA. I pity those 10 people for their commitment to being flying monkeys.
cdjx17,"YTA for ignoring it instead of having a conversation with your boss and communicating.  If you have an issue or question, particularly with your boss, you should address it professionally.  Ignoring an assignment is a bad move."
cdjx3f,"NAH

There is nothing wrong with going to church and being respectful while there. The only problem would be if you drew attention to your beliefs (or lack thereof) and got in people's faces about it."
cdjy9m,"NAH. I mean to clarify her parents are, but she just seems lonely/maybe a little neglected. That being said obviously you want her to stop doing what she’s doing so you handled the situation fine."
cdk1eh,"NTA, You clearly didn't do anything wrong and by the sound of it she even knows you to an extent. Maybe next time try talking first, but you clearly didn't do anything wrong or inappropriate and those people are just looking for the worst."
cdk1ih,"NTA being pregnant is not debt excusal, and shes being manipulative"
cdk221,"NTA. She wants your attention and this other guy's attention too. She is playing serious games. She isn't your best friend. She is the girl who has you on the hook. She doesn't want to date you, or she would find a way to make it work."
cdk4fj,"YWBTA. Yes, it would be weird and insulting to not invite two of your groomsmen to your bachelor party. I doubt it will ruin the whole night— you have no problem with these guys, you’re just annoyed that you succumbed to pressure to make them groomsmen. It’s too late now and you need to get over it and invite them."
cdk5ld,NTA. It is perfectly acceptable to be mad about an accident caused by someone's negligence.
cdk70x,"YTA. If a guy took me to his ex's work on a date, I would think he isn't over her and was trying to rub it in her face. Not a good look. No vegan ice cream is worth it."

cdkl3z,"NTA And seriously, he needs some serious mental health help. Hurting yourself to get something is seriously emotionally abusive, as is the entitlement of believing you deserve someone whether they want to be with you or not. I'm also concerned about the girlfriend, since she started dating him because she felt bad for him? Holy shit this has so many red flags it screams get away. This goes way beyond him just making fun of people. 

I'm not saying just lay into people who have mental health issues and I'm not of the mind that people should have to take anything that they dish out. If one person doesn't mind being teased, teasing them doesn't mean you want to be teased. But if people have expressed a problem with it and everyone tiptoes around him that's a big problem. 

I'd be more concerned about getting his girlfriend help. She's likely in danger."
cdklq7,NAH. Better to tip in change than cancel the appointment.

cdkp4z,"YTA.   Working more than 4 hours a week for the summer is a very reasonable expectation for your parents to have for you.

cdkph5,"NTA. Dude, it doesn't matter who or what you are, you *don't* get to decide what other people's gender is. If you're a girl, you're a girl. End of story. Being nonbinary doesn't make them the J.K. Rowling of Gender Identity."

cdkua9,He has a girlfriend. He can borrow her phone. You owe him nothing. NTA.
cdkw0s,"YTA, but an unintentional one. I understand wanting to be open with your kids about your family, but I think that it would have also been tactful to explain to your children that it’s not an appropriate topic to bring up with others - especially your brother’s children. I can see why they’re upset and likely hurt, because that information is something that they should have been the ones to disclose to their children when they felt it was appropriate."
cdky5l,"INFO: holy shit why does your school charge so much? At mine, renting a gown was $30. Grad was free."

cdl7h4,NTA he doesn't know how to clean up after himself
cdld7w,YTA to yourself first of all because when you inevitably get a ticket you’re going to be pissed at getting one. I can’t comment specifically about how annoying it would be to have to move your car every two hours since I’ve never experienced that. Now that this lady spoke up it’s very likely the next time she sees your car she will remember and call it in.

Your dad needs to get off his ass and support himself."

cdm0j5,"Empire waists make you look pregnant. This isn't news. Your wife knew it. 

NTA, sort of. You and your wife need to get on the same page about this type of question. If she really wants genuine feedback from you she needs to be genuinely ok with you giving it.

Your wife needs to dress for her size OR be okay with displaying her body. Either are fine options but she can't have both."
cdm1h3,"NTA. It's becoming more widely known that buying two seats next to each other is more expensive than buying single seats, so cheap-skate families will purposefully buy seats all over with the plan of guilting other passengers to move around to accommodate them. Your friend paid for that seat, if anything they should have offered some sort of flight voucher/complimentary food/drinks to your friend for moving."
cdm56r,"YTA. She wants to see her family, and you can afford it. She didn’t sign an eternal contract when you agreed once a year; she’s realized that isn’t enough for her. Why on earth would you want to hold her back from going just because you can’t go?"

cdmosa,NTA. My god you’d think you were trying to name your daughter “Cock N’ Balls” or something.
cdmptw,"NTA. I'm a bit baffled on how her relationship with him hasn't affected your friendship, however - he's a bigot and terribly ignorant, and she doesn't seem to do anything to put a stop to it.

cdn5xk,"YTA - sounds like you decided to literally dump all of your frustration on her because she didn’t respond to your text about her dog dying. 

For most people, the loss of their pet is emotionally hard. You said it yourself, you cut the relationship with her after the dog sitting, so it’s unclear why you wouldn’t give her a break because you haven’t been talking to her as much either. 

You agreed to dog sit, and she paid you despite you insisting that she shouldnt, then you complain about payment. You said that you only dog-sat for a few days, yet are blaming the entirety of your poor internship performance on the dog sitting experience. Wtf?! 

This family sounds like they’ve helped yours out a lot and you’re extremely upset bc your cousin, who just lost her dog didn’t text you back? Come on"
cdn6hb,NTA. What he’s doing IS racist and he’s creating a hostel work environment.
cdn6xw,Isn’t it required ?
cdn8bo,"NAH, but I would let it go.  She is doing you a solid by letting you crash there.  You have a right to make a request, but she has a right to agree to it or not.  If it is that much of a bother, spend a few hundred and stay at an extended stay hotel."
cdn8bt,YTA Go tell him he needs to find someone else if you can't or won't. If you are scared of going to do him a solid you should be more afraid of screwing him over. Much more afraid
cdn9dm,"Not super severe, but YTA.  Just because your company asked you to work doesn't mean you HAVE to work.  Your wife obviously planned this for some time and was really looking forward to it.  I seriously doubt she lost it just because of this one event, but probably because she feels you don't care.  I understand your feeling of helping your family, and that's admirable, but you may not be seeing the bigger picture here as to how she is really feeling."
cdndbw,"NTA

Orthodox Judaism is toxic af. There's a reason I don't talk to that part of my family anymore."
cdnec0,NTA. He’s old enough to help out.
cdnegj,Nah. I feel similar. I just say oh that’s cute and reply with a pic of my cats.
cdnf7c,"NAH.  You did what was right for you.  You did what you were paid to do and (I assume) left with notice.  You fulfilled your obligations and you don't owe the company anything beyond that.  If your co-workers were put in a bind because you left, that's on the company for not planning for contingencies, not on you."
cdng43,YTA you don't live there and don't pay rent.  You can ask your gf to bring it up if she can do it without implicating you.
cdngky,"I’m going to go out in a limb and say YTA, borderline NAH because it’s so slight. Listen, I get that you want your alone time. Who wouldn’t? But, at the same time, this is the last time she will see her family for at least a year. If it’s important to her, let it go. You don’t want to start off your marriage with her disappointment. Suck it up, go see them and then have a blast on your honeymoon. You will have many opportunities to be alone once your married."
cdnl3b,INFO: is there some sort of legal document spelling out that your father can live in the house for the rest of his life?
cdnmav,NTA  You offered to take your roommate home and he CHOSE to stay and wait for her so that's on him. You told her when you would be leaving and she didn't show up so that's on her. If she isn't going to communicate with the group then let her figure out her own ride home. She doesn't chip in for gas and she isn't 1 of the drivers  anyway so she shouldn't bitch about it.
cdnnfl,"I agree, but you don't believe that a 16 year old using slurs is an asshole? Or his father that is defending that behavior? Come on, it's 2019, we know better. I knew better at 16 and so did everyone I hung out with, and I wasn't even all that socially aware or politically involved yet."
cdnouc,"ESH. Your mom for asking about a stranger's race (and yes, she does have a reason). You suck too for not rising above it and just answering. It's your mom, for crying out loud. No need to make it a whole issue. Pick your battles. One day you'll miss her stupid questions."
cdnp1u,Your boyfriend's mother is an animal abuser. Don't leave your dog alone with her. Your boyfriend talking to her isn't going to make a difference. Board the dog or find a friend to keep him when you can't.
cdnraj,YTA only slightly you clearly dumped a drunk chick on him b/c you didnt want to deal with her.
cdnsn4,NTA. Buy you should go and take your dog. It's not for John to tell you who you can or cannot bring as it is not his party. You should have run John's comment past Steve and checked whether its still okay with him if the dog comes. It's a bit strange of John to be absent all this time then start laying down rules. Not sure I understand how he gets a veto. He could always keep his kid away from your dog.
cdntdn,"YTA.  Even if politics isn't ""interesting"" to you, it affects you, affects people around you, and affects the larger world in which you live.  You should care at least enough to educate yourself on the basics to the point where you can make an informed decision and take the time to vote.  Things that are important aren't usually fun, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth doing."
cdntl8,"NAH, you'll only be TA if they decide against it and you start whining about their decision.

You might have more luck if you go into them with hard numbers - a typical wedding in this city is $50k, if we manage to keep it under $20k, would you be willing to give us some of the $30k difference to us so that we could put it towards our debt?  (Numbers are totally made up, actually do your research before taking to them.)"
cdnuri,"ESH/NAH - ultimatums aren't great, but if your GF needs to be married to stay in this relationship, that's a boundary she's allowed to have, however poorly she expressed it. She could have been calmer, but you also need to stop logicking her feelings. She wants to be married. You don't. That's a pretty solid reason to leave a relationship.

Your focus on living together is a boundary \*you\* can have, but it's incompatible with her desire to be married now. Neither of you may be the asshole, but you're both going to be single.

Edited to add: Also, couldn't you live together while engaged?  Something's fishy.

Edited a second time: Thank you for my silver!!!"
cdnxhr,ESH but YTA big time. If you have a problem with sexist remarks in the workplace take it to hr. You don’t deserve to essentially steal what was his because he’s a sexist asshole.

cdo0uw,"NTA it's just lack of awareness. In the future if you are in a similar situation, translate what is being said to your gf immediately so she doesn't feel left out. Just tell her you didn't mean to cut her out of the conversation and that you'll think about it going forward."
cdo1b6,"Other women did not consent to be flashed by male genitals in the sauna. While your friends may have been fine with it, it could have ended very badly for your friend if someone complained about her. I think you are NTA because you told her semi privately to not embarrass her."

cdoh89,NTA Your gf is being super weird on this one
cdoii2,"NTA - she hasn’t paid you when she said she would, and seems to be ducking you to avoid payment. Stop taking care of the cat and bring it back to your friend. I lowkey think she’s trying to get rid of the cat to you. She probably realized the same things you’re realizing, but doesn’t want to deal with it anymore."
cdoj5o,NTA but all you did was inconvenience yourself.

cdosf3,"Eh YTA. Not because you gave her McDonalds,  but because you encouraged her to lie to her parents."

cdov1u,"YTA

Reason 1:  You bailed on the girl before she was even awake the next morning.  Hitting it and quitting it is something you get out of your system in your teens or early 20's - not something you continue to do well into adulthood.

He was probably trying to be nice and assure you he was gonna try to make an arrangement for y'all to get plenty of rest but instead you snapped at him which no matter how tired you are is never an excuse.

cdpy49,"for the love of god, please don’t be that stupid with your money.

My dad died when I was 6, back in 2003, and I've also had issues getting attached to other father figures even years later. It's a normal thing, imo.

You were also in your early twenties by the time your mom remarried, and now at 25-ish there's really no need to tell him when you've never even gotten close to him. You aren't being mean - you just don't see the need for it. You're not obligated to tell him happy fathers day. For what it's worth, I don't tell my mom's current husband happy fathers day either; but he's also an abusive prick, so it's a little different"

Tell her chores cost money and then charge her an hourly rate. If she doesn't like that, then too bad for her."
cdq94y,"NAH. But hate is a strong word.

I think your aunt is bitter, and this is normal for anyone dealing with grievance of a lost loved one.

Your mom obviously cares for your aunt, and only want whats best for her, would even go out of her way for her. Maybe one day your aunt will realise that.

I would tell your mom that your aunt is in grief and has recalled some unpleasant memories, like those from her miscarriage. Hopefully this is enough to hint your mom about the conditions she's undergoing.

Sorry for your loss.

Taking care of someone with reduce capacity is hard. and it require a lot of energy and your parents need their vacation I am sure of it.   
It would be nice of you to help but to do it all alone + working is alot. I think a good thing would be to seperate the work load between you and your grandma's friend. 

hope you guys can find a way to work it out. but also it's a week, it's not too much and your parents shouldn't have yeld at you but they probably are very stressed about it all and I understand that it puts an additional weight on their shoulders."

cdqp8p,"NAH I can totally see why you reacted the way you did, but its also very hard to be expressly forbidden to see someone you care about. Approaching the conversation with a little more empathy probably would have helped her reaction a lot more, as would gauging his exact influence on her. I dated a drug dealer in high school, never had a fake ID or did anything worse than weed. 

As an aside, fake IDs and hard drugs aren't COMMON. It's not unheard of or the biggest deal ever, but it's certainly not as common as highschoolers drinking or smoking. A fake ID and dealing adderall are a relatively big deal."
cdqq18,"NTA.

> she calls me and told me she bought me ticket and I should come.

She bought your ticket without your consent, basically forcing you to go when you didn't want to.

[Via Inc](https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/the-definitive-guide-to-buying-the-boss-a-christmas-present.html)

>The workplace is not an egalitarian place. There is a hierarchy and people who have hire/fire power authority over you don't get a present from you. This is not because you have a bad boss, or as revenge over that small bonus. It's just not the proper thing to do. The boss can give you a present, but it does not go both ways.

>As Judith Martin, better known as Miss Manners, says, ""You should not be giving presents to your boss. It's the boss who should be giving the present if anyone does, and it should be a bonus or failing that, extra time off."" All hail Miss Manners.

>Emily Post agrees, but consents to a group gift to the boss. She gives her stated reason for no individual gifts as it might be seen as trying to ""curry favor"" with the boss. She's right. There's just no way for you to give a gift to the boss and have it be neutral

Buy some nice snacks for the office and write personal notes thanking people for their help.  That is an appropriate gesture, not your tiered personalized gifts."
cdr4r0,"NTA

Although you probably should have figured out she used a fake I.D. and lied about her age to get the piercing in the first place, you gave her the benefit of the doubt. Upon confirmation that she did indeed lie, which proves her untrustworthy AND puts the piercing parlor in a bad position as well, I think your punishment was fair. 

She shouldn’t get to keep something that she gained by less than ethical means."
cdr59s,"NTA I don’t think he should have been messaging you if he had a girlfriend, and I think most girls would want to know if their boyfriend was asking for other girls numbers.

But for him to out of the blue ask for it makes me think he had intentions to cheat on his SO."

cdrbv4,"NTA it was your stuff, end of story.

cdri4t,"NTA. Your child is still very young, you have valid points considered, and if you're not yet comfortable with leaving them with someone you don't know well enough yet, it is entirely your right to make that decision.

cdroa4,"YWBTA it’s understandable that you’re angry, completely understandable. But if you were to up and sell his PS4 just because you were mad and because you paid for it, you would be stooping to a very low level.

cdrpco,"NTA - based on the story you've told here. K sounds manipulative and somewhat toxic. Does K have a boyfriend of her own? Does she date? Does she have many friends outside of just you and the other housemates ?

I wish my parents had been more strict with me about keeping things tidy when I was growing up. My messiness carried over into adulthood, STILL does, and I'm 25. It's a hard habit to break, leaving small messes because you can always ""do them later"" then shit adds up. It'll be beneficial for her to have the habit of keeping her personal space clean. My only thing is maybe instead of putting it off until next summer, make it that she can't get it until she keeps her room clean for a reasonable amount of time (a few weeks or a month) and let her get her license with the condition that she can lose car privileges if she doesn't keep it clean)."

Tell him to match the hourly rate of your new job offer at a minimum if you're even thinking about staying.

Your story reminds me of a place I worked at.

I left that shit job. And you should leave yours. You put in a lot for them and they're berating you like that? Find a new job in your free time - then hand in your notice. Garbage managers treat their teams like shit. Petty, pathetic people with nothing good in their lives. They take out their frustrations on their teams. Leave that place.

Don't tell them why you left or anything. Just say the new place pays you more."

I'm actually really worried if there is something wrong with the relationship between your wife and C (or rather, how your wife feels about C).

Some of your defences can still hold yeah? ""I never said all of X people steal a lot, and of course its annoying when some steal"".

But if you were from X group, wouldn't this offend you?  


I'd say the best course of action is to realize that what you said could be offensive, especially from a family member. Then I would apologize, but I would be firm on your ideas for the party, when she suggests something that you don't want, politely say that you want it the other way, don't convince her why its better, just say ""I want to do it this way"", and if she pushes then just say something like ""I know its  not necessarily better but this is how i envisioned my party so this is how I want to do it"", if shes' still pushy like I said above I'd involve the mom."

This one hits close to home. I haven't spoken with my brother in about 5 years because he, in my unofficial diagnosis, has Munchhausen's and feeds off of people feeling sorry for him. For many years I witnessed or would hear about how he would rant to people (sometimes strangers) about his ""abusive childhood"". Granted, it wasn't an easy childhood for any of us but our family was built around love and sticking together through the hard times. To hear him talk about it you would believe he was beaten around the clock and raised tied to a radiator between bouts of rape. Downright lying about things that never happened. One day, he announced in spectacular fashion that he was cutting ties with his ""toxic"" family and would never speak to either of my parents again. I told him to fuck off and I cannot bring myself to speak with him for being such an insufferable asshole. My sister still talks to him from time to time and she tells me the only thing he has to say to her is about how ""gaslit"" we all are. It's gross and sad.

Anyway, my parents are sad in the same way. They feel like they lost a child and they are heart broken that a seemingly inseparable bond that connected us as siblings is probably forever destroyed. If my brother got on the right meds and pulled his head out of his ass, came up with an apology, I could forgive him- but that's probably not gonna happen.

With regards to your sister, I think your suspicions are correct. *Something* happened to her- and I think she's gotten into some misandrist literature on the wacko side of militarized feminism. Now I'm a feminist myself, so I don't mean that in a pro-Trump anti-SJW kinda way, but there's a wacko for every cause and your sis sounds like she drank somebody's Koolaid.

I'm sorry, I feel your pain. You don't need to reach out for your father's sake. If you came to a middle that would be amazing but it'll take both parties to patch a rift like this up. I really gotta wonder what context brought on this sudden personality change."
ce0dlj,"NAH. 

All three of you are going through a big transition. Your daughter may be acting out because of the big changes, or pushing boundaries with her mother. 

Your ex is learning how to be a mom to her daughter. I don't think you are helping this situation by trying to micromanage her parenting though.

If this continues, why not offer to attend family counseling together?"
ce0dze,"NTA. You might have scared them a bit, but that’s not a problem. It sounds like they could use a little dose of reality, the words they were choosing to use were gross."
ce0fg2,NTA - the teachers are responsible for student safety during a school trip... Leaving a student behind is incredibly irrisponsible
ce0ifj,NTA 100%. Tipping isn't a thing in Europe like it is in the US. I would report him as it's kind of harassment
ce0l8c,"YTA- She didn't block you for no reason, she blocked you for trying to  convince her to do stuff she doesn't want to.

Stuff like this affects her relationship with her dad, and she can do whatever she wants."
ce0nle,"NTA in my opinion. 

It’s not that OP is shaking her for money, it’s that she planned on that extra money and was probably doing Pat a favor since taking her would most likely cost more than $100. I am a big planner myself and to have someone pull out a day and a half before would set me off. It would also ruin the trip for me. 

The MIL didn’t need to get involved, Pat fucked up and ruined the whole surprise for everyone because she didn’t plan correctly. Now everyone’s upset.

But overall, it’s your car/vacation/trip, so do what’s best for you. People might be mad or whatever but driving that long is gonna test your limits, so driving with someone you’re mad at is gonna suck."
ce0q36,NTA. you dont even have to babysit kids that you love and tolerate if you dont want.
ce0ren,"NTA, from a cannabis activist. Smoking weed is amazing and I do it literally all day every day.... unless I need to be aware of my surroundings. Getting high lowers your reaction times, your situational awareness and comprehension, and induces a certain level of apathy. All of these things are harmless in an ordinary situation. But when someone’s life is on the line these changes can easily have negative effect and can be the difference between life and death.

The lifeguards can smoke all they want but they need to do it off the clock. I guess they will be, now."
ce0rwd,"NAH, you aren't an asshole per say, but I would try to see it her way. Your sister is probably nervous about being unprepared for college.

FAFSA (for first years especially) comes after classes start. I remember getting mine in October,  that halfway through the semester. That's a long time to go without a laptop for a college student, especially given that most assignments are only taken via a computer.

Also, you're young but life isn't a competition of who has a shittier life. Just because you did something different than her, doesn't mean she isnt allowed to feel upset by this."
ce0tdx,"NTA. She's taking two bedrooms, you're being pretty helpful all things considered."
ce0tq8,"NAH. Brushing your teeth in the bathroom is fine, just don’t ever do it in the break room or something. We’ve been having that issue at work."
ce0tzj,"Why is she eating this at her desk? If it was the kitchen it would  be fine, but not cool to impose smells onto others in the work area.

&#x200B;

Also, thai curry is Thai, not Indian.

&#x200B;

NTA"
ce0wco,"NAH - but you don't really need to be the asshole for your wife to be pissed off at you in this situation. After all, intentional or accidental, you did injure your child and your wife has a justification to be angry at you for doing so."
ce0wpp,"NTA, seems pretty petty for them to flip out over something so minor. She probably could have washed the bowls in the time it took her to complain about them being dirty"
ce0y97,"NTA. Seems like you went through all necessary channels and tried to give her every opportunity to stay above board and handle it properly. From what you say even if she just reached out during that time frame she could’ve gotten her dog back when she was back on her feet.... To be honest it seems like the dog will be in a better home with you, anyway."
ce0y9h,"ESH- weirdly I was 13 when my dad took my 9 year old half sister on a Disney Cruise and I was destroyed. I would have preferred to go with but it was “my moms summer” and she didn’t want to let me go for 9 days, and my dad didn’t want to wait until the next summer, so I understand your situation. But this is for your daughter(s); not for the parents. The two parties can work it out. Maybe if one of you talk to your stepdaughters mother, she’d be ok with letting you take her that week or something, provided in the future that consideration is also extended to her. My sister always says she had less fun because I wasn’t there with her; it’s always better to keep sisters together. Try to work something out; and keep in mind that 13 is not too old for Disney, idk what age would be. Its fun for the whole family. There is not an age limit on fun."
ce13bf,"NTA. Even if your Uncle wasn't gay, your sentence would have made perfect sense. Your family is projecting a lot of shit on your words."
ce13p5,"NTA

Your step mother is a narcissist."
ce17bf,"For saying it?  No. 
For screaming it loud enough that everyone on the floor could hear? Yeah, kind of."
ce17v6,"NTA.

This shit:

>And basically saying he will never help me again and how hard it is being my husband.

is manipulative as hell. Adults don't completely shut down in the face of constructive criticism like that! He's creating a situation where you'll just shut up and tell him he's right anytime you disagree because it's easier than dealing with him blowing up at you. 

""I'll never help you again."" What an absolutely childish response to someone trying to voice their side of the story. SMH."
ce182x,"Yikes wtf, NTA. Is there anyone higher up in the shop that you can take this up with? Incredibly unprofessional of them."
ce192u,"YTA

If you turn it up so that you can hear the TV over them, then *they also* will hear the TV over each other.  So you are making it more difficult for them to talk to each other.  better solutions than turning up the volume: (1) sit closer to the TV (2) turn on some captions, or (3) *ask* them to change rooms or keep it down, instead of trying to overpower their noise with your own.  

tiny bit of ESH just cuz the way your aunt talks sounds very patronizing.  but ultimatley she's right that you were rude."
ce1bdy,[deleted]
ce1bpx,NTA - No it's yours once she gives it to you and if it's meant for your daughter just giving it to her seems completely sensible.
ce1bvz,"NAH. Honestly, this is such a trivial thing that asshole is way too strong a word. You’re really only hurting yourself by being so pissed about something that doesn’t mean anything at all. They might not even see your outstretched hand. They probably don’t even realize you’re trying to make a statement by putting it on the counter."
ce1g0n,"YTA - don’t mouth off to your mom, kid. And maybe check your texts if you’re going to keep your phone on silent. If she’s texting you to get off your phone *while you are on your phone*, you should’ve at least seen the text notification."
ce1ghr,Ill go with NTA. She cannot control when your dogs go out. You put up a fence within city guidelines if she wants further rectification she can pay for it herself. Good luck with your crazy neighbor
ce1hyp,"NTA

You took one of them to get a present and the others could have tagged along if they wanted (even if they didn’t know about, too bad because they should have been more involved in the process)."
ce1hz3,NTA. These “prove your love based on a hypothetical” types of discussions within relationships are just pointless and painful. You explained that plastic surgery is a dealbreaker for you. She probably has some dealbreakers as well. Stop having these hypothetical conversations.
ce1j71,"NTA - He sounds really lazy and lacking any motivation or direction. If he can't help himself, there is nothing you can do. Continuing to do his applications, paperwork, etc. will only enable his shitty behavior and attitude. I'd say drop him, he sounds like dead weight."
ce1jlp,"YTA - Holy shit, how can you not see that? 

First, you went on a trip as an extra, this was not about you, it was about your mom and her colleagues school. 

Second, you were clingy and needy the entire time and made things harder on your mom, for whom this was a work trip.

Thirdly, you brought this on yourself. You knew what the trip would be and you also didn't take medication you were supposed to. That's all on you. 

Finally, you decided to throw a temper tantrum at age 17 because things were not going your way.

No one forced you to go. Grow up. You were 100% the asshole in every situation you laid out."
ce1ke2,"ESH, stop doing this and being petty, everyone buys their own groceries."
ce1kpj,"Hmm. NTA. If you have power of attorney, that means he trusted you to handle his money!"
ce1lq5,"NTA. Put yourself first. If you don't want your parents to come visit you, that's okay. 
However, let them down gently. 'Ohh I'm really sorry, [unexpected piece of work] came up this week, I'll be really busy. See you on Christmas!' would be a way to go."
ce1mfb,[deleted]
ce1mkb,[deleted]
ce1qcq,NAH. You can wear what you want for whatever reason as long as that reason isn't to annoy someone else.
ce1rab,YTA. You already agreed they would stay till 12. Cutting that short cause of personal fears was an asshole move.
ce1s79,"NTA. I don't say everyone sucks here because everyone was in on the fun of dark humor. The problem is, that guy didn't want to take a joke. Saying 9/11 is more well known is just announcing his limited world view. If he can't take it, he shouldn't dish it. That being said, if this were my friends we wouldn't have gotten upset about it because everyone knows you were trying to make us laugh, and you weren't just being mean."
ce1shj,"YTA. Learn tact

>  I told them that I have a more important event currently occupying my time.

Is an asshole's way of putting it."
ce1skf,NTA- you gave him multiple opportunities. What's HR gonna do? Pay for him?
ce1vdg,"YTA  (You're The dumbAss).

Your friend is allowed to have more than one friend, and allowed to do stuff with whoever she wants to. I'd absolutely rather spend my time/money traveling to a new country than to one I've been to several times before.

Even if it was your girlfriend/boyfriend I'd say that you have some narcissism issues, let alone if it's just a best friend.

It's also possible you guys just aren't as close anymore. She may not consider you her best friend anymore now that you live so far away from each other. It happens. It's understandable to feel sad but doesn't give you any right to her time or money."
ce1w09,"YTA, it's not your car so they get to call the shots. You paying for gas doesn't mean anything.  If you were already paying for insurance I'd feel differently, but since you aren't yet, YTA."
ce1wtb,"YTA, are you an asshole? yes, but was your actions funny? also yes."
ce1xj5,Written like a made up story

ce1zy5,[deleted]
ce2025,NTA he never asked yo hold the baby. It's not your place to just hand the baby to him.
ce20vh,"NTA.  Although there is the argument that he is in his home, he should also be considerate in the common areas (living room, kitchen, etc).  Having a roommate means making compromises in a lot of ways.  It sounds like you tried to talk with him and he didn't want to take your thoughts/feelings into consideration.  Depending on how big of a deal this is for you, you may think about finding a different place/roommate."
ce22em,"NTA for not wanting your brother in your life but knowing how your brother is, you should try to keep an eye on the baby. It’s not it’s fault that your brother is how he is. If he has a drinking problem that could really cause problems for your new niece/nephew."
ce23ac,"NTA. Terrible joke, Terrible outcome, You are not the school rule creator, you was asked a question and you answered the question. do I think that the school went way to far? yes, that is a terrible judgement and who ever thought of a punishment that harsh without letting the victim (you) decide if you wanted to take it further (instead of a small apology)  is the real asshole here."
ce24ms,"NTA. They pay minimum wage and request one months notice? That is absolutely bull shit. Would they give you one months notice if they were going to terminate you? Hell no. 

Minimum wage = Minimum effort/expectations"
ce259c,NTA- you pay to live there. It's your shared space too. You didn't know they were coming home right then. You apologized. She should apologize.
ce25kl,">Husband wants them to stay, and said I had no say in it because even though I’m on the lease and it’s not my house because he pays the rent.

NTA.  Your husband is being a disrespectful piece of shit.  You being a SAHM is a joint decision, you aren't lounging around eating bonbons all day.  If he thinks your job is so worthless that the house is all his because he gets a paycheck for his work, he's welcome to hire a maid, childcare, a personal chef, someone to run errands, and buy a fleshlight.  You don't need that shit.  They need to leave before they earn tenant rights.  Check your state laws."
ce271d,"Am gunna say NAH and if u think it would help you should tell them, what type of drugs are we on about tho? If it's just bud or something ni harm done"
ce273x,"YTA, just put 10-20 (or however much you actually want), not 100. That's ridiculous. You even said you don't actually want 100, just a big handful."
ce286t,"NTA, but there's nothing you can do here. Your mother is helping family in a rough time. I can understand how this must be getting to you, since the kid seems like a little turd. 

Sorry, dude. Hope you felt better letting it out, though."
ce28ei,"It would be YTA. If it's known in your town and you've managed to figure out exact details about child support and her mother's depression, chances are she already knows about it. Telling her like you're some sort of secret informers will come off as rude. Even if she truly doesn't know about it, she'll find out in her own time."
ce2aiz,[deleted]
ce2b8y,"YTA

Bell peppers are not loaded with citric acid."
ce2bgm,YTA if you do that. Having a dog for a month is nothing like having one full time and this is an issue for your parents to sort out. Stay out of it.
ce2c72,"NAH- it's been 20 years, the money is gone, there is nothing you can do."
ce2chg,"NTA
 
The guy is TA and shouldn't be stringing the girl along like that and guilting her into following his lead. I would keep open communication with the girl just in case something potentially bad is happening behind close doors. Just sort of let her know you're there for her when shes ready or something like that. Other than that, F the other guy. I would have intervened as well."
ce2ezy,NTA - actually pretty good move to reduce the tension between your parents .
ce2fg7,YTA - Inability to control your laughter is a dangerous problem . You must realise this whole situation may sound funny to you yet very delicate to your cousin's family .
ce2gnc,"I don’t know how to judge this, but it seems like maybe you’re not over it. It is kind of a strange move to happily invite someone to an event and then, at the event, cry over something that happened between the two of you when you were 12. I understand where your feelings were at, but I also understand why he felt awkward and left."
ce2hl8,NTA you have him multiple opportunities to come get his shit. He wanted free storage. Just keep the texts and call log to prove you tried to give it back.. just in case he ever tried to say you didn’t try.
ce2hoy,"Why in the hell would you think you’re in the wrong?   

C’mon son"
ce2ipr,"NTA, if it went down exactly as you say, it's a serious and worrying appointment, now your momay have some twisted idea in her head that she wants to do those things to distract you from it, or she may even be quite scared herself and using these activities to distract herself, which is understandable to a point but no less selfish of her."
ce2jqe,"NTA

If the kid loved his haircut you would be the asshole. If you were a grandparent or babysitter, you would be the asshole.  

As the coparent I think you're well within your rights, *only because* your son didn't like it. It's pretty odd that he thinks the haircut should be ""both of your choice"" while refusing to let you have a choice in the matter and actively disregarding the opinion of the person whose head that hair is on."
ce2kuz,I commend your thoughtful approach to wastefulness but y'all are really petty.  ESH.
ce2oph,"NTA but if it’s giving you heartache “I had a few reasons, but it was really great to be able to help out at home since my mom’s sick and I got some great experience for my resume working with a startup”

This way you’re shifting focus away from why you took time off and towards what you did with the time, without placing “blame” on anyone"
ce2pzi,Esh. You might be right but sometimes right isn't helpful. Getting him in therapy sounds like a pretty good idea. Laying ground rules is fair but he might just have some good old fashioned depression.
ce2qdo,"NTA, do what you have to do for your own mental health"
ce2rbk,"NTA for thinking he’s fucked.   Did you plan on being a dick about it?  If so, then YWBTA."
ce2th5,NTA. He’s a suffocating friend who doesn’t know get that people can’t drop what they’re doing to answer his calls or text. I had a friend like many years ago and I cut him off without explanations as well. You did right by you and your sanity.
ce2v7h,[deleted]
ce2xiz,[deleted]
ce2xt3,"NTA. Spay and neuter your pets people, it keeps stray puppers off the streets and out of the pound."
ce2yof,NTA. I don't think you did anything wrong. You just stood up for your neighbors. It might have made the person picking the flowers a bit defencive as after all they thought they weren't doing wrong. Or maybe not. Good on you for standing up to what's right.
ce2z92,[deleted]
ce31do,"NTA, you and your sister have already established this ritual between the two of you. Just because your friend didn't ring the bell/knock doesn't mean that'd inhibit her from properly greeting your sister and her family."
ce3499,"YTA, she has the right to expect privacy in her backyard. It's also just odd to ask when she's sunbathing outside. I understand your concern about it, but really it's too much to expect your neighbor to notify you about their routines."
ce3ah8,"Nah. It sounds like you need to keep up the therapy though. Sounds like he worked his ass off and wanted you to do better than your deadbeat mom. He may not have handled it the right way but his heart was more than likely in the right place. It's tough, but he is right you do have to do something with your life or you're kinda fucked. Therapy is the first step and good on you enrolling in class. You're an adult. Do what is gonna make you happy and keep you from being homeless. Gastronomy or getting a job or whatever."
ce3gpe,"NTA

A yeast infection is something ***incredibly*** private, and your aunt has no reason to need to know that. Your grandmother was way over the line."
ce3ibo,"NAH. It's annoying, but five's little mind is blossoming. Who cares if five thinks they're brothers? It's just not a big deal, I don't think. Mildly annoying at worst."
ce3jdy,"YTA. He's your best friend, at least talk to him and let him know what's going on. You're not obligated to be with him, but ghosting is a dick move."
ce3k87,[deleted]
ce3knf,NTA. You didn't know; there was no intentional malice behind this.
ce3n1x,[deleted]
ce3o3f,YTA don’t be a dick to employees
ce3oha,[deleted]
ce3q9x,"YTA 

Don’t get me wrong, your husbands parents are monsters for abusing the dog but that’s not relevant to the judgement because it doesn’t have to do with this situation. 

As in, it doesn’t have to with the question are you an asshole for insisting in the money. 


And the answer is you are an asshole.    You aren’t pet sitting. You adopted a dog.  If you went through a shelter you wouldn’t get money from the shelter. 

If you guys don’t want the cost of a dog, rehome the dog."
ce3qma,"NTA - Having worked in food service, I’m surprised they’d even **let** you take the drink; that’s a major sanitary concern and it just seems like basic hospitality regardless. The fact that she treated you badly for asking tells me she might want to find a new job"
ce3qvv,"NTA. 

The discount subscription is only for a year until you start getting billed full price and is limited to one purchase AFAIK so idk how feasible it is to use it on multiple computers.."
ce3r17,">  but when your metabolism slows down and you work an 80 hour week, you kinda need to cut pot out of your life for the greater good 

just wanna point out that the alcohol is the one doing a number on the bod, not the weed."
ce3s9u,NTA. I wouldn’t want to be friends with people who left me hanging after paying for a trip let alone put myself in a situation to have it happen again.
ce3t67,"ESH - you're still a minor so it is your parents responsibility to cover doctor appointment fees but then you really shouldn't take money without permission so that's why I say ESH.  


Also, your doctor can send a bill later for the co-pay so you really didn't need to take that cash from your dad without his permission, you could've just told the dentist office employees to bill your parents for it and they'd send the bill for the co-pay to your house."
ce3uzf,"She doesn’t want me to drive her car because since I moved out and got my own she took me off her insurance. And since she owns that car she has every right to tell me no. Which is why I was thinking of bringing the one I bought myself, but that still upsets her"
ce3vlw,"NTA

Gavin needs to learn that if you give things to people, it’s theirs. And if they give it to someone, it doesn’t mean Gavin can just take it back. Kinda seems like Gavin thought he found some sort of loophole. No, go away Gavin."
ce3wki,"YTA. Pay for your own freaking rooms if you want to start bothering people about $17. 

His mother paying absolutely counts as expenses he took care of. This family was generous toward you and you are being rude."
ce3xxx,"NAH. If it’s your money, you can spend it now you like. Your parents do have a point though."
ce3yaj,"NTA - if she wants to drag herself down into the third world hellhole of Saudi Arabia, then she can go there herself.  Just act SUPER shocked and disappointed when she has her ""big reveal"", and tell her how disappointed you are in her."
ce3ypk,NAH. Have you had a conversation letting her know which of her habits are upsetting you and tried to fix them before just kicking her off the account?
ce42b0,NAH. You aren’t a jerk for asking but your mom also isn’t a jerk for saying no. Let it go and enjoy the Olive Garden tortellini.
ce42fq,NAH. The only thing you did wrong here is letting the joke go on too long. You probably should have told him the truth before the end of the night.
ce462w,"NTA- he is taking advantage of you. He no linger needs to babysit the baby, your child could get injured. Tell him he needs to get a job and pay a set amount for rent and other Bill's. Document it all and get it signed and notarized. Sounds like brother is about to take you for a ride."
ce4677,NTA. Your being the adult.
ce472u,"NAH. 

Your sister seems fine with it. Don’t worry about it unless it becomes a problem."
ce49ut,NTA - you were being nice.
ce49xc,Yta. Not for dating someone your friend liked (he can’t call dibs on a person) but for dating someone you didn’t even like.
ce4cwq,"YTA. 

Cars aren’t a necessity that parents are required to provide for their children. Not to mention, you’re an adult. Save up and buy yourself a car or find another way to get around town."
ce4epd,"ESH. 

You're an asshole for breaking up with her and getting back together with her a day later, playing games with a relationship is a shitty thing to do. 

She's an asshole for rubbing the fact she smoked into your face the way she did.

I hate to say this, but it just sounds like you two might not be that compatible. If you can't both act like adults and find a compromise your both happy with, this relationship has no future. 

It sucks but it happens sometimes, sorry bud."
ce4gnj,ESH.  I believe that unfortunately you WBTAH here.  its an unfortunate situation but it is their yard so you cannot have any say in how long their dogs are in the yard or how much noise they can or cannot make.  Although your neighbors are assholes for not training their dogs not to bark their heads off.
ce4jea,"NTA 

You are responsible for people drinking at your party, if she went out and got hurt or in an accident, it would come back on you.  Ask those people in fifteen years if they would take that risk and I bet they would not."
ce4kd0,"NAH you were trying to let him know you're okay with it. Just in the future, let him approach you to discuss it when he's ready. Just continue showing him how much you care for him and love him and he'll come around, if he even is gay, and tell you eventually."

ce4nwi,"Well, that's obviously a naive attitude to have. I can't say that it makes her an asshole, though. Don't we all dream of getting rich quick!

Perhaps she'll change her mind when the reality of the industry sets in. Making porn is hard work with long hours, the same as any acting job, and she would need to maintain her body to a high standard."
ce4pl7,"NTA, here's your validation"
ce4qmw,"NTA

How you feel is your business. Also, he knew the lease was ending, how was it short notice? Why wasn't he looking ahead of time or trying to renew?"
ce4rzh,"NTA

Cursing is one thing, but to use racist slurs is another. If you feel that they took it too far you were correct in reporting them. The higher ups of your roleplay chat site will take proper actions whether they see it as punishable or not. Keep having fun with your chat, it's okay to want to foster a comfortable setting."
ce4t0h,YTA. She's 18. She's perfectly entitled to a dating life and private life.
ce4tdk,"YTA.  Even if you think he should tip, he’s not under any obligation to.  In fact it was rude to not just answer his question directly."
ce4uf3,"YTA. 

Smiling at you or making jokes to you doesn't mean she's flirting. She may have been trying to be friendly and you just ignored her. By the time you finally got around to being friendly, maybe she decided that *you* were the unfriendly one and didn't want to put forth the effort any more. Or maybe she gave you a taste of your own medicine. And you're going right back to being unfriendly again, and your co-workers are being less friendly with you because hey, you're kind of an asshole."
ce4wus,"YTA 

Don't interfere with your girlfriend's professional life. She's already told you that she doesn't want you sending a complaint. She's not a child, she can work it out herself. Your intentions may be positive but your attitude is really paternalistic toward your girlfriend."

As long as they are qualified bring them in!"
ce4z2v,"NTA. Also, tell your dad and think hard about moving out. If you knowingly give them to her to sell, aren’t you an accessory?"
ce4z75,"NTA

Not even close. Sean's behavior is immature. He declines being exclusive then gets all hurt over you taking him at his word? If he's not even willing to talk to you about it or get some closure then he's not even worth another thought or a Reddit post. Log back on, Hunny, you are NTA"

This is literally her job and she made a mistake that cost you money. You have an accountant do your taxes to avoid mistakes."
ce52id,"NTA

If the title does not have the word ""Always"" then YWBTA

At least you put some effort (1/3 of time) to bring her to the park

But if I may suggest, try improve it. You might not notice it at your current age, but later on you will cherish your dog more. Also a friendly reminder that dog lifespan is shorter than human, if you know what I am trying to say here."

ce59bs,NTA: don’t give her the time and respect she didn’t give you
ce5d0k,"Okay, well I’m gonna say NTA for being mad but YTA for just wanting to straight up get a divorce immediately. Try and work this out, it sounds like you just want a divorce anyway and finally found a good reason. A divorce shouldn’t be the first answer to every problem in a marriage."
ce5dm4,"I'm going to say NAH, except for maybe the other cousin for moving in and enabling the behavior. 

Severe trauma changes a person and it can take a long time to recover from that. Your cousin had a near-death experience at the hands of someone that she loved. That can really fuck you up. What she did was not okay and she is responsible for it, but I don't feel right calling her an asshole for being different after going through something so life changing. 

You are not an asshole in the slightest from separating yourself from a situation that was toxic to you. You should always be your top priority. 

I don't see the harm in meeting with her to talk it out, you might be really glad you did. Either that, or you'll be more secure in your decision to never speak to her again. It hurts when the people that we love turn against us, and I'm sorry that you're going through that.

Edited to Add- You may find some really great advice by posting this in r/relationships, this is definitely deeper than anyone being an asshole."
ce5ed4,Not an asshole just weird. Maybe find a hobby?
ce5gg2,NTA. Anyone purchasing alcohol or tobacco should know to always have his / her ID.
ce5ght,"Jesus Christmas. This is a hot mess. 

NTA. Don't play her game. Let the police know about the stalking, this is really serious."
ce5gu4,"NAH

Many Mexican places do offer tacos a la cart, and the restaurant really should have a picture of their menu posted somewhere - FB, Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc. The person taking your order should have also quoted you a price before your pickup. 

I don’t think you’re TA for not paying for food you didn’t order, and I think them not trying to charge you shows that they’re good people too."
ce5h26,"NTA.  This day is about you, and if you don't want her to come than she shouldn't be invited to go."
ce5hrn,NTA that's basic parenting. You did the right thing.
ce5hw7,"YWBTA Because you dont control her and she made these plans before she was with you. If you trust her then there is no issue with her going out to dinner, in a public place. If he makes a move she should reject it and if she doesnt then you know she isn't the right girl for you. Plus trying to control her ( especially this early in the relationship) is a HUGE red flag."
ce5k1p,"NTA. As a tenant, you have the right to complain.  He is probably from a security company, and will most likely just be assign to another property."
ce5kux,"Unless you're an uncontrollable teen, I would say NTA. You're 18, that's legally an adult. Although if she pays for the netflix, phone, etc, then it's her call. Try having an adult conversation about it, see what happens. If not, do you have a job and can pay for your own netflix subscription maybe? Unfortunately, most times, parent's house, parent's rules."
ce5laa,"NTA. Biological similarity does not make you obligated to him in anyway, love between brothers would, but doesn't sound like he's ever fostered any of that for you..."
ce5ldo,"NTA. You’re the one who’s actually graduating, it should be about who *you* want there."
ce5lxw,"YTA. My parents are wealthy and pay for all my significant other’s vacations, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and food when on vacation once a year.

His family pays for nothing when we go with them every few years. We split the hotel room, the food, everything.

It is what it is. No one is mad. You’re being an ass by disinviting him. 

You’re asking if it makes you the asshole to  disinvite your boyfriend from vacation because his mom chose not to pay for your dinners, right?  I mean, seems a little extreme to punish him for that."
ce5m8r,You should just delete him from Facebook all together.
ce5o5y,"I think YTA if you frame it in that way. The caterer was supposed to bring food. That's really the only thing he should care about. Although the rest of the event was delayed, that's not his responsibility. For example, if somebody had a flight to catch, but missed the flight due to the delay, does the caterer need to pay for their flight? 

What *is* his responsibility was not being three hours late, and delaying things by 1.5 hours. Was there a contract with the caterer? If it doesn't say anything about delayed services, I'm not sure what you can do here."
ce5p6h,"ESH. Why do you keep including this guy on birthday gifts if he never pays on time or the full amount? Just include a card or note that lists all the contributors. No need to single that guy out. 

TBH I wouldn’t want to chip in for a months-late birthday gift of a $200 t-shirt either."
ce5ray,"Nah

Y’all sound like grown children."
ce5rbg,"YTA because this is a habit and you do it on purpose. Once or twice is fine, but you know this about yourself.  It’s not cute or quirky to be a late gift giver (or late anything). Time to get some time management skills.

Your friend was probably so happy because she thought you weren’t giving her anything at all. A month to pick out leggings? Really?

No one is entitled to your gift but i think it’s generally bad manners to habitually give gifts late if you are going to give one."
ce5rd9,"NTA - if it makes you feel better and you can do it in a way that isn’t rude or demeaning (like you’re trying to), then whatever floats your boat. I always felt better having personals at a festival so it looks more like you’re just smoking a cigarette, reducing paranoia. Of course, that was in the days when you had to worry more about getting caught with herb...."
ce5rg8,NTA. You clearly beat her to the money cause she saw it and she was trying to bluff you into giving it to her. If I was missing $100 I would know it was $100.
ce5rjc,Without further clarification on why he’s estranged I’m going to have to go with YTA. It’s not your wedding so you can’t dictate who gets to go (unless you are paying for it). As time goes on some people like to let bygones be begones and move forward. Have you asked your sister on what her intentions are
ce5rtk,"NAH. It’s hot. Everyone’s hot. Daily parts of living like cooking  don’t stop because it’s hot.

If she wants to control the oven use she needs to live by herself and not in a shared space"
ce5sm8,"NTA. Not trying to get into a political discussion, but it sounds like this girl was determined to be upset and nothing was going to change her mind. One of the reasons I like marvel movies so much is that their meaning is fluid, similar to comic books and music. If the movie speaks to you on a certain level, even if it’s not what the directors or actors initially intended, then it’s still a valid reason to like the movie. I’d say just movie on and enjoy not having as much drama around"
ce5ujh,"NAH

You can celebrate it whenever you want."
ce5us3,"NAH kids will do what kids do, you told them to stop please the mum backed you up.

Don’t worry your fine"
ce5v54,"NTA

He has a job to do."
ce5xsx,"NTA You are not the asshole for having feelings and you wouldn't be the asshole by choosing to have your own life. You have sacrificed enough for your family. You can't stay there until things are bad enough you snap. She endured something terrible, but other people have too and they can move on with their lives, specially with childrens involved. You need to find your own path, you aren't a nurse or a nanny, you are still a child yourself.
That said, it's going to be crazy tough. You are probably fight with her a lot and feel a lot of guilt. But this is your life. You may be able to help your siblings more in the future with a degree and financial stability."
ce5xyb,"Obviously NTA, he paid for one thing and got something else. He’d be perfectly in his rights to request they fix it.

That being said, I think there’s a lot of strength and kindness in your dad’s decision to empathize with the workers and cut them slack on it. It’s admirable."
ce5z0j,"NTA, you even left him some money to help out. Why should anyone get to control the way you leave the relationship? It's over. He ended it. I guess it's because you *blindsided* him too with the way you moved out lol.

 A wise comedian once said the best way to move out of an ex's place is to pack up your things when she/he isn't home, and get the hell out of there while they're out."
ce5zsd,"ESH:

If you thought/think it was a gas leak you shouldn't be playing detective and getting into arguments. You shut off your gas, go outside, and call your gas company.

Since this just happened. Do the above if you haven't already."
ce5zye,"NTA. You did the right thing, no doubt about it. You are the kind of parent I want to be when I have kids. Those parents are idiots and should be mad at their son for lying to them. Gold star for being a good parent"
ce6142,"NTA she’s a toxic person, unwilling to work to make sure she has a relationship with her family."
ce614p,"ESH. Your parents shouldn’t be allowing this, your brother is behaving like a jerk, but your stunt was also uncalled for. If it bothers you that he’s on his phone, say something."
ce61qv,NTA. It’s not your responsibility to raise your siblings regardless of your mother’s disability. Go to your dream school. Your mom is going to have to figure shit out.
ce62m2,NAH it's just a bug but that's so weird that you keep a jug if juice next to your bed... Why not just keep water next to your bed?
ce6488,"NTA. I would have fired his ass, too.  He harassed and mistreated the building manager. 

Also, for your friends who say he shouldn’t be fired because it’s expensive to hire a replacement—they’re wrong. I’ve had to fire some really good workers for doing some really stupid things. Actions have consequences."
ce66si,"I’m leaning towards YTA. Not completely, but I do think that you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. Your fiancée is obviously very close with her family, and I don’t see how her spending a few hours helping her sister is going to throw a massive wrench in your wedding. I understand that weddings are stressful, but I feel like it’s pretty shitty and manipulative to tell your wife that she “isn’t prioritizing her marriage” simply because you don’t agree with her splitting her time between the two events. I think that you need to take a step back, a deep breath, and then get over it.

Edit: From your AITA post a day ago, you noted that you and your fiancée are from different countries and that because of visa rules she won’t be able to leave your country for a year. She’s literally giving up the ability to see her family for a YEAR to marry you and live in your country. I think you can give her a few hours to help her sister."
ce66v5,"NTA, as a fan of the reefer myself I have come to learn this. A bag left behind is no longer yours. There’s no reasonable explanation for it to still be there. Whether it’s someone in your shoes, and disposed it or it’s another smoker who grabs it and pockets it. It’s gone for ever."
ce67r1,"NTA. I'm a Target employee, you did the right thing. We want guests to feel comfortable all the time, and we don't want to risk those kinds of situations."
ce6cq3,"NTA - If they want to throw a birthday party, they should pay for it. They have no right to keep asking you for money if they do not contribute."
ce6d1t,"NTA

Mothers in law are infamously irritating in the ways you have described, hence the invention of the relevant joke category. 

Also, your husband should grow out of his mom's tit."
ce6fjt,"YTA   The project wasn't exactly what you anticipate?  Well, welcome to the business world.  It's too late to back out now.  It's not what you like or feel like doing?   Don't be a child in adult clothing.  

If you want to tell your boss that your might be quitting to give him a heads up, then do that.  If not, suck it up and follow through."
ce6hia,"NTA

Animal abuse is unacceptable and you need to protect your pets. It's *their* home and they are helpless without your protection.

Hopefully the gf doesn't last because that's really creepy behavior. It's disappointing that your family isn't taking it seriously."
ce6hrv,"NTA. You could literally be saving her borrowed-time life. In my opinion, you handled this the best way possible."
ce6kdf,"YTA

While you may be correct that his attraction doesn't have potentially deadly consequences, you are judging him in the same manner you've most likely been judged as a lesbian. It was shitty for you to call his relationship ""creepy""."
ce6kya,"If you're an asshole for not tipping at TacoBell, we're basically *all* assholes.

NTA."
ce6n37,"NTA then. He puts in no effort to change, I don’t think you have to make an effort to be around someone who acts in such a way around you."
ce6opm,NTA- Your ex is a shitty person who chose addiction over the well being of her family and tried to rip away your kids from you just because she wanted drug money. Your family are fools to continue allowing her into their lives thinking she won't try to take advantage of them. It'd be one thing if they were trying to help her get clean but as is they just sound like stubborn idiots.
ce6pcb,"YTA if this isn’t a shitpost. 

How do you know how the kitten died? Why didn’t you tell the police officer that the roommate had neglected the animals? Why were the police responding to this instead of animal control? How did animal control know enough to know the dog was a potential threat, but not know who owned it or where it lived?

Yeah. This has got to be a shitpost."
ce6stl,"NTA. I either invited or didn't invite people to my wedding. What's with this ""you can come when people are starting to leave"" business?

Your ex straight up lying to you about you being invited to the wedding was also a dick move. They're not obligated to invite you, but all this stuff surrounding the invite was both unfair and bizarre."
ce6tij,"NTA 

Your SO may be a student but they're not your student. That's too much responsibility to put on a person."
ce70it,"ESH. People shouldn't text and drive, it's a really dangerous habit. 

However, you're not the police and that's an inappropriate use of the horn."
ce725k,"NTA. I work in Disabled Student Services for a US university. Technically speaking, the animal doesn’t have to wear a vest. I just went through a 2 hour webinar about this. 

Also, your coworkers could get your employee sued for their comment. The only thing you’re allowed to say is a list of 2 questions:

1. Is this animal required for a disability? and 2. What has this animal been trained to do?

Anything else opens you up to an Office of Civil Rights complaint and possible legal action. 

You’re good."
ce737b,"NAH. 

Also, what is sauté day? Sounds fun."
ce747c,"Be honest and tell them you can't work the schedule. They will rather change the schedule and find someone else. 

YTA if you tell them your Grandma has cancer. Don't jinx Grandma!!"
ce75cr,"YTA. Eavesdropping isn't okay. There may be some ways for you to help, but this isn't ultimately your business. It's likely that he didn't just outright tell you because he feels vulnerable/doesn't want you to treat him like glass."
ce799s,"NTA

She didn’t follow company policy by telling you 6 weeks in advance, and your company did nothing about it. Why is the policy in place if no one will uphold it?"
ce7a1n,"NTA - who cares what an *entitled* waitress thinks. You tip to show gratitude, just like she should show gratitude for your tip."
ce7bhk,"NTA

This guy is definitely not your friend. If he doesn’t know or care enough about your recent troubles, that’s on him. Also, demanding an expensive gift from a coworker no less is a huge red flag for a friend. You’re definitely NTA, don’t worry about getting him a gift."
ce7cny,"NAH

He asked and you said no, there isn't much more to it since they can't *expect* you to do it."
ce7d2s,"NTA. He is definitely the victim of an abusive relationship, emotionally and mentally (wouldn't be surprised if physically), he probably doesn't know how to get out of it or finds himself unable to imagine leaving a relationship that he's already this far into. She sounds like she is trying to isolate him from others which is a common tactic for abusive partners who want to keep them under their control. You need to make sure he knows that if he ever needs help for anything (without telling him you think his SO is abusive) you're a call away."
ce7hri,"NAH. If the position's vacant, and you still work for the company, it's logical for you to take it. You can't avoid promotion forever just because your friend was fired."
ce7j4b,"NTA. Oh man, teaboos are a riot"
ce7k0t,YTA - what was the point in making the crayons unusable? surely you could have fidgeted with something else
ce7khm,"You don’t know the full extent of the dogs well being since you weren’t there. 16 is geriatric, especially for a large dog. Frankly, I’m shocked a Pointer would live that long. Even if the dog wasn’t suffering, he might have had a compromised quality of life etc. try to have compassion and empathy for your mom, who was the primary caretaker of the dog. A different approach to the conversation will probably elicit a very different response from your mom. 

Also, a geriatric dog who is losing control of their bladder/etc gets up in the middle of the night. It’s not for lack of exercise. 

NAH"
ce7ncg,"It sounds like you have been enabling her for years and not doing much in the way of toeing the line.  I'm a little confused about that because after actively enabling her long-term, what finally was the last straw for you?  A boring little spat about texting responsiveness.  Whatever, NTA."
ce7pu3,"YTA- why the hell are you sneaking in the house and hiding from her??? Also...If you’re home you help.

Edit- ESH. She should do her job but I’m so much more concerned with you being a huge creep."
ce7rre,NTA. They tried to fleece you and got pissed you caught them. They deserve the bad Google review for taking advantage of their customers.
ce7scp,[deleted]
ce7vfz,"NTA

1. Your mother took you saying ""I can wear what I want"" as a personal attack on her, when that's not what you meant at all. I don't know enough to judge, but it seems like she's trying to guilt you.
2. I don't think your sibling had business telling you to shut up. If they're treated favourably by your mother, they don't really have a right to tell you you're being selfish.

I'm so sorry your family makes you feel bad about your body, you don't need their approval. You deserve to wear whatever you want and look fabulous. Don't starve yourself to lose weight, eating disorders are never the answer ♥"
ce7wbs,"NTA 
One dollar is nothing. You still got to look around."
ce80wv,NTA. Your dad is using you to deal with problems he’s avoiding confronting himself. This is an incredibly unhealthy situation. I would make moving out priority number one.
ce87fj,"NTA - I don’t think it’s at all funny to belittle a kid, especially when they’re trying."
ce88du,NAH as long as you phrase it as a request or preference. He doesn't need your permission. But it's entirely possible he just hasn't thought of it this way and would be open to the idea.
ce8a0c,[deleted]
ce8c74,"NTA, but don't tell him to piss off -- tell him, ""Dad, it really bugs me when I feel like you're using me to get info on mom, especially when I later hear you badmouthing her to your sister. Please stop. I know you're hurt and upset, but she is still my mother and it's upsetting for me to hear her badmouthed and to feel like you're using me to spy on her. I love you, and I love mom, and I need to have a relationship with both of you, and I feel like you're trying to interfere in that, which makes this even harder for me."""
ce8civ,"NTA. Your dad owes you an apology, not the other way around."

ce8ee0,"NTA. It's their error and they can live with the fact that they messed up, but don't expect to stay on their good side for long. If your employer deducts any money from you going forward for this flub, you should scooch on over to r/legaladvice."
ce8ee1,YTA. it’s none of you’re business; you’re not his superior.
ce8h3v,"NTA. It’s for one night, she’s being unreasonable. If she objects that much to sharing with her dad, she can sleep on the floor. Your family has already been kind in letting them stay with you guys, you shouldn’t have to bend over backwards for her, especially since you aren’t particularly close."
ce8hw6,"NTA lmaooo is your coworker 7? Why is he walking around farting at work, especially when you work at a grocery store??"
ce8i72,NAH. You guys aren't used to each other's personalities. That's all that's happening. There's nothing more to analyze about this situation.
ce8i9k,Seems like r/legaladvice would be a better place for this.
ce8irn,"YWNBTA if you calmly and politely explained to him what was wrong with his behavior. 

You would BTA if you called him a “douchebag” to his face. 

It’s part of being a teacher is expecting good behavior and you should make it clear that your don’t tolerate racism/sexism in the classroom.

Edit: because I didn’t read right, sorry!!"
ce8lme,"NAH. You had a reasonable request, they were being teenagers."
ce8mqv,NTA because she made plans FOR you and didn’t even tell you. Does she have no respect for you? People usually aren’t ready to just hop off to a huge formal event at the drop of a hat.
ce8n1b,"NTA.  BUT, it happens, you just have to learn from it.  You wouldn't be the asshole if you tried to get your money back.  It's your money.

Just ask yourself is it worth the time and effort."
ce8n5r,"YTA. Learn how to actually ask for something. Offering to treat your friend to something also wouldn't have killed you to show you that you valued her time, which you clearly didn't by saying 'need this k thx you're the best.'

She should have been mature enough to tell you to fuck off and that she wasn't doing it, so she sorta sucks but not enough to warrant the social media stalking and following passive-aggressive (ETA: and such gaslighting guilt-trip bullshit!) text you sent her."
ce8q49,"NTA, she isn't respecting her husband's boundaries or your feelings, she also seems to have blatantly lied to her husband about the trip since all she wanted to do was shag some bloke and not meet up with friends as she claimed. I think you should tell her husband and if she confronts you stand your ground."
ce8rr1,"NTA, It's your group, they knew the name of it before they signed up. If anyone protests, go full asshole and just make it an all gender group, invite all your guy friends, thats true equality."
ce8vef,"NTA.

If she knows you’re coming home, she needs to leave a fucking way to get in. Deadbolt = no bueno."
ce8xho,"You're the asshole for making up a fake family death in order to miss work. 

Kidding! I'm kidding!

NTA. As a boss, that is a policy that you just have to accept is exploitable because it's such a dick move to require proof from grieving people."
ce8xtb,"YTA definitely don't snitch. You're a housekeeper, not a nanny."
ce8yjo,NTA. If T isn’t your boss he shouldn’t be acting like it. And even your manager agrees.
ce90pa,"NTA at all. Asking you not to wear gloves, look away, or ""cradle"" her hand instead has no purpose other than making you more uncomfortable than you need to be. 

Stepping up and taking care of responsibilities (i.e. cooking, dishes) while she was injured proves you're willing to take care of her. Being squeamish about touching her finger means nothing. That she chose to make a huge issue out of something this small makes me think she was already looking for a reason to pick a fight. 

Also, calling you a pussy/wimp is at best extremely childish, at worst it is abusive and manipulative. I won't try to armchair your relationship, but just know that you don't have to be okay with your partner calling you degrading names. That's not a normal thing."
ce92mf,"NTA

dogs > Bird"
ce96of,"YTA, I'll say it. Your bf is inviting you as his +1 to his SISTER'S wedding. This tells me he's very serious about you, do you really wanna muddy the waters by using this trip as an opportunity to meet your ex? Even if your intentions are pure, it's kind of insensitive. 


I don't think guys generally invite girls to family member's weddings unless they're ready for the inevitable talk of: ""Ooh, when are you guys going to be next?"" And you're thinking of meeting your ex? If you can see a future with your current bf, I suggest you keep the past in the past and just continue with your intermittent catching up over phone/ computer."
ce9deo,"NTA

You asked to not be called something. That's a reasonable request. Automatically calling someone a homophobe because of that is ridiculous."
ce9dyv,"Dude, mental health comes first over all. Look out for yourself, if therapy works for you, keep going, do everything you can to help yourself. Your mum shouldn't be complaining about it, yes medical bills are expensive and all but you're her kid, there shouldn't be a price on your mental health and stability and there should be no question of your mental health coming first. Go get the help you need, the fact that you've commenced getting help is fantastic, just gotta stick at it, because it's so easy to find reasons and excuses in other people to stop going. You're doing great, keep doing what you're doing. NTA."
ce9fz7,"NTA. What you've described is sexual assault, and that's not okay. It's natural that this is bothering you, and if it continues to, you should seek therapy.

Men can also be victims of sexual assault. 

*No means no.*"
ce9ji9,"NTA

They were wrong to block your driveway, even more wrong to ignore your warnings and requests. You went about it the correct way and got the car towed. I don't see what else you could have done. Good on you OP."
ce9koh,"Without a doubt YTA. You punished everyone for the actions of one or maybe a few people. No one has the right to touch your food and in the same way you have no right to touch theirs.

However, I suggest spiking your lunches with ghost peppers or something. Won't be long until you know who's taking it."
ce9l2x,"NTA - It's possible you need to spend more time with them *outside* your room, but that doesn't rise to the level of you TA, and definitely doesn't justify the idea that they should just be allowed to enter your room and tear it up at their leisure."
ce9lqw,"NTA. She is responsible for her own actions, which include the late return. Her family situation did not cause her to hand in the book late, it's a bullshit excuse. 

She owes you $25."
ce9mlu,"YTA. Never bring other people into your lies. It's bloody rude. 

I don't even know why you posted here. Your girlfriend already explained to you why you were an arsehole."
ce9oc8,"Wow. You’re one angry mother fucker right now aren’t you? Understandable, you just lost a grandparent and clearly hate this girl. 

Info - is this your decision to make? 

Frankly I’m the same about my house and feel uneasy letting people stay there when I’m not there. Can she go back to her parents while you’re all gone or something?"
ce9oru,"YTA. 
 
 Who are you to judge his suitability to be a teacher? You are still a student yourself. Dick move."
ce9pkw,"I think your dad has made a big mistake and he doesn't really understand the depth of the situation. I don't think there's a clear cut answer to whether you should cut contact again or not, but you're definitely NTA. I guess my question to you would be in her response to you did she give any indication that she understood the gravity of the situation, how much her alcoholism, her neglect, her homophobia etc have damaged things - or does she just want to pick up like there was never a problem? If that's the case I think you'd sadly have to conclude she's incapable of changing."
ce9qep,"NTA - the commitment you made when you got him was to give him a loving home, and you're not reneging on that. It sounds like giving the cat away is what's best for everyone involved :) 

P.s. find yourself some less judgey friends if you can!"
ce9td4,I don’t know if you need to confront him.   Sounds like you’ve got a lot of anger and built up shit towards your ex.  But maybe something just like “hey I don’t want to hear anything about (ex fiancée). “.  You can’t stop them from being friends but hopefully if you ask to not hear about it your friend will listen.
ce9tgj,"NAH.

You are probably overthinking it."
ce9ukk,NTA is your husband dumb?
ce9wl6,"NTA

She scammed you. Get your money back."
ce9y3t,NTA - Sounds like she's got grandbaby rabies which is extra ridiculous because you're only 20. You should absolutely cut contact until she learns to behave herself or it's just going to get worse.
ce9zal,"Um, NTA

His health background isn't 'personal' when he's demanding you sleep with him...

This shouldn't even be a question

You're gonna get tested, right?"

I could be wrong - I'm judging from a post - but I don't get a great feeling from the vibe of your writing.

With all due respect because I truly believe you're hurting over this - is it possible that your feelings of negativity about not getting pregnant are affecting how you feel about your daughter and her fertility struggles?

Told the boys if they ever set hand or eye on me ever again he'd take them away and they'd never see their mother again.

Edit: for clarity, we had contacted the school, police, council districts, everyone about this and they kept putting in 'measures' and they never stopped.

Extremely wrong for a 40 year old man to threaten a 12 year old boy.  Morally wrong. But they never touched me again.  

For the first week, I was fucking humiliated.  Ever since I've never stopped being grateful that my dad stopped another however many years of severe bullying, which could have made my depression worse, suicidal etc.

cedis5,"YTA

I'm going to go YTA here.

On the one hand, your house and your rules.

On the several other hands:

- You invited them both to stay in your home with an understanding that their relationship is serious enough that they would come to a family event together.
- Your daughter is 24 years old. She is well beyond the age where her parents should be policing such things (from the title of your post I was expecting a young teenager, so I just about fell over when I saw the age of your daughter).
- Your daughter is quite right: marriage is one possible route for a relationship to take, but she might never choose that for herself. As such, your decision signals to her that unless she chooses to get married, any long-term partner she has is going to be relegated to second-class citizen status in your home.
- You're considering forcing her partner, ostensibly a guest in your home, to sleep on the couch, simply by virtue of the fact that he is in a relationship with your daughter. If anything, shouldn't he get a bed for the night, seeing as he's a guest? [Edit: OP clarified elsewhere that it would be a futon in a private room, which is an improvement, absolutely, but I still stand by this point.]
- You did not even consider whether your daughter, an adult, would be remotely comfortable sharing a bed with her aunt, another adult. That would make me incredibly uncomfortable.

The over-arching theme here is that you are not treating your adult daughter as an adult, and while you have that right (your house, your rules), you will alienate your daughter, as well as her boyfriend (who could be [Edit: and has already been] in your lives for quite some time or forever), and send the message loud and clear that you don't trust either of them to make responsible or appropriate decisions without your involvement or interference.

[This comment got a lot more attention than I was expecting so I jumped back and made one or two edits that I've marked above. I'm glad that I seem to have represented my point of view well.]

Edit #2: OP if you read this, in light of your edit, thank you for your introspection and flexibility. I'm certain your daughter will appreciate this and I hope that she recognizes that it was a difficult decision for you."

Edit: since a lot of people are making the same counterpoint, I want to clarify. OP should have taken the puppy to the shelter immediately, where the owners (if there were any) were surely calling looking for it *before* his son had 40 days to bond with it. Big mistake."

At least she’s found a permanent, happy home.”

Compare this to your current scenario:

Your daughter’s baby girl, now ten and officially adopted, is looking at family photos. She realizes this one was taken while she was already with her adoptive mom.

“Why am I not in these photos?” She asks her dear grandmother. 

“You were a foster child and so I didn’t consider you my real grandchild, lol, so I refused to have you in the picture. Sucks, kid.”"

You accepted him and were just trying to understand, and when he made it clear he didn't want to talk about it anymore, you accepted that too. Being lgbtq+ is ofc a really complex thing, but it's also possible that your friend is simply trying on different identities and that's fine too, but transitioning IS a big decision and you were trying to be supportive and understand if that's truly what he wants.

ceio2u,"This is an extreme response to the circumstances. She’s obviously having a bad day, but she needs to not take her bad day out on you. NTA"
ceior1,"> she collects hair in mason jars 

Ew.

NTA"
ceiq2g,"NTA

Instead of arguing she could have just agreed to pick you up. Then she could have avoided this."
ceiqjq,"NTA if you say “Hey, thanks for jamming with me, but I’m not sure we’re a good fit musically. I’m looking for more experienced players who’s skill expands my horizons. Keep rocking on!” Or something similar."
ceirz9,"NTA. Your roommate that kept the money without your knowledge keeps you in the right. What a shitty thing for him to do to you.
The only reason your roommate said it “didn’t involve you” is because he didn’t want it to involve you because it would result in you getting money that he selfishly wanted to keep hidden from you so you wouldn’t benefit from your kindness. 

You let his friend stay because you’re a good person. He let his friend stay because he wanted income.

I’m sure his friends agree with him because he’s probably lying to them about the scenario the same way he lied to you."
ceis3w,"NAH.  Nobody should ever be considered an asshole for simply having thoughts.  It's our actions and reactions that define this characteristic, IMO.  Also, it's not your mom's fault for having MS, and you're a fucking angel for being the helpful, care taking daughter that you are.  In fact, I'd even argue that most people could take a lesson from you when it comes to responsibility and unconditional love."
cej5pq,"NTA - if it were 7am, you might be an asshole. At 11, he should be fucking ashamed of himself. Grown ass man complaining about his roommate cleaning too loudly at basically noon. Jesus H."
cejclj,NTA. Your partner doesn’t get to dictate what you put in your body and weed isn’t considered a “hard” drug. It’s not like you’re relapsing on meth.
cejdd0,"Wow weird story. You have a septalingual family? 

They sound like septalingual assholes to me. 

NTA"
cejduj,"NTA he shouldnt be using his mental illness to guilt others into relationships. OP you should make the best choice for yourself, his choices are his own to make. I would honestly avoid him so you dont feel obliged to let him cling to you"
cejebh,"YTA. Right there in the title, a family heirloom. Unless you're going homeless or you have your dad's blessing it would be a dick move."
cejguz,NTA- you don't insult people until after the transaction.
cejhas,Nta people often feel threatened by the self sufficient amongst us
cejjxp,"ESH.  They were absolutely being total assholes (and doubly so for the vandalism), but after the first time they told you to fuck off, you should have just filed a noise complaint instead of stooping to their level and escalating the situation.  Plus, the rest of the neighborhood didn't need to hear more noise.  

I'd encourage your parents to get cameras for the outside of their house, just in case these guys decide to do something else."
cejkya,NTA.  You have to do what's best for you.  If being a lawyer and criminal justice is your passion than thats what you need to do.  Good luck.
cejsvr,"NTA - these situations can be very very trying on somebody. It is a shitty thing to do but imagine being faced with a situation where your SO could potentially pass, somebody who you depend on and have depended on for so long.

I get why you feel this way but it is kinda normal for her to act the way she did considering the circumstances. 

There is a fine line between being scared and trying to shift the worry you have for your father into her and you are gonna need to be the one who figures this out for yourself.

Anyways, I hope your Dad has a speedy recovery and everything works out. Cancer is a bitch."
cejtkr,"NTA. 

I fail to see how the Taco comment your mother made was racist. 

That being said your mom clearly has some strange opinions about opinions that she should try to resolve."
cek2hq,"NTA

Though you probably shouldn't have agreed to begin with, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a pallbearer for someone you barely knew."
cek2m4,"NTA.  Digital records being what they are, I think if you're being associated with what comes up when you Google your name, changing it is understandable."
cek3ju,"ESH. As you said, both of you could have handled it nicely, but you didn’t."
cek4fz,"ESH, she's overreacting a bit, but she also has the right not to feel uncomfortable in her place of work.  

You don't get clothes or a robe ready before you shower?  How hard is that to do?  If you didn't think it was a problem, you wouldn't have felt the need to hide until she went outside.

Just apologize and then prepare better in the future."
cek4v6,"NTA. You have two EXTREMELY good reasons not to take this test. Plus, you really don't owe anyone your body parts as a general rule."
cek8xz,"I was seriously considering that everyone sucks, but settled on NTA.  Instead of ""them or me"" it might have been better to phrase it ""I don't want to come second to them anymore."" There's a difference between ""you can't be friends with them"" and ""you can't keep making me an afterthought."""
cekbyi,"NAH. You wouldn’t be TA because it is your dads decision. And your dad wouldn’t be TA because it’s his money and he can choose to spend it how he likes. However, I would recommend you to talk to him about it so that you get a chance to voice your opinion."
cekdkb,"Your question doesn't seem stupid at all!

NAH. Toy Story 4 is a kid's movie, and anyone who goes in to see a movie aimed towards young kids should expect a louder-than-average theater. And interrupting ""every 10 minutes or so"" isn't that bad - I've been in theaters with people who were way more disruptive way more frequently!

If you guys want to try it again, there are some theaters that do autism-friendly showings - they keep the sounds a bit lower, and leave the house lights up a bit. And, he won't have to feel self-conscious about his echolalia, since everyone there knows it's an autism-friendly screening and that's a fairly common tic."
cekehq,NTA- 50 dollars a day for almost half the day is complete bullshit. She still wanted cheaper too? You're not even related to this child
cekib9,"NTA, especially if they expect you to pay out of pocket to return something that they sent in error."
cekiu3,NTA. You shouldn't have to lie for your friend. If she wanted you to lie she knew it was wrong. You warned her about it coming out. The 19 year old had a right to know and X asking you to lie was a horrible thing to do. You shouldn't have been put on the spot like that. What she did was wrong and now she needs to deal with it
cekjx8,"NTA, but realize you will potentially embarrass your gf, which could lead to complications in the future."
ceklwx,"NTA

TL;DR: This isn't really about you. This is about your dad and your stepmom wanting a picture-perfect family life too quickly and becoming frustrated that it isn't working out the way they imagined.

Relevant info for me:

- There simply hasn't been enough time. A few months is the base of a much bigger mountain left to climb, and your dad and stepmom need to allow for that kind of time to pass before they even think about applying pressure.
- But even then, I don't believe that pressure would be justified. You can't be forced to enjoy someone's company or want to be close to them. You and your stepsister might never get along, and for better or for worse, your dad would have to accept that if it were the case.
- Your dad and stepmom's strange insistence on this process happening quickly suggests that this is less about you and more about their own insecurities about the situation they have created. I think it's likely that they worried about a situation like this when they decided to marry and move in, and now you are confirming that fear and making them question their choices. And again, that isn't on you. It's on them, and their own (unrealistic? Idealistic?) expectations of what your ""blended"" family would look and feel like.

All of that said, please consider your dad's perspective on this. You have no obligation to like or spend extra time with your stepsister, but I do think it would benefit you to show a little empathy to your dad. Talk to him on your own and repair a little of what appears to be strained. Emphasize that the fact that you and Lacy don't connect well doesn't mean they made the wrong choice or that anything is necessarily wrong. And in the meantime, be respectful and civil to Lacy. You do have to share a living space with her and it might make things easier on you to break down the wall a little. But you are not TA at all for resisting the efforts currently being made to force the issue, and I think that your dad and stepmom are risking a greater divide between you by approaching things this way."
cekmi5,NTA - parents are gone and you are a working adult that needs sleep. She doesn't respect your sleep when you have let her have friends over in the past so NTA its her own fault for your mistrust.
cekmq2,"NTA—

Well, just explain to your family that you don’t plan to do much sleeping during his visit.  Problem solved.

All kidding aside, you are respecting your parents’ wishes to not cavort under their roof.  You’ve handled this well."
cekort,NTA. If you are meeting up at 6 am then a 2 hour heads up is appropriate regardless of the time of day.
cekqfw,Put out feelers for people willing to foster the cat for you. Not actually feeling your cat.
cekqxf,"NTA, a birthday is the same day every year. You made a plan and told him the date, he agreed. Your roommate sucks."
ceks0e,"YTA. Dude just eat dinner with your dad, it's all of ten minutes. Plus if he's spent time making you the food then you grab it and bugger off to watch YouTube that seems rude to me."
ceku0h,NTA tell him your bf loves you hairy and it gets his cock hard.
cekw9b,I’m not sure you’d be an asshole but you’d be an idiot. You’ll be paying rent one way or another so if you separate from your girlfriend it’s not lost.
cekypo,"NTA

TL;DR: Your MIL has routinely made choices that contradict or flout your authority as parents, and her being unvaccinated puts your child at significant risk; your husband needs to step up.

Relevant info for me:

- Whooping cough is dangerous, and if your MIL is unwilling to be vaccinated, she has actively chosen her convenience over the welfare of your child. In essence, she has made her bed and needs to lie in it.
- Her disrespect of your parenting decisions should not be overlooked at all, and are likely to get worse if she does not see consequences. Anyone you leave your child with needs to respect, full stop, your wishes as parents, as long as those wishes are not neglectful of your child's health. She does not have the right to assume authority over her grandchild's rearing.
- Your husband needs to step up to the plate and deal with his mother before the boundaries get even more blurry. He is already enabling and excusing the behaviour or does not see it as a big enough deal. He needs to value you and your baby beyond the wishes of his mother, because his first responsibility is to the two of you and your welfare and safety.

The vaccination problem alone makes this a hill to die on, in my estimation. Stay firm and take steps if you can to ensure your husband doesn't unilaterally make arrangements behind your back, god forbid."
cel15y,"> I have it turned on for everyone but my overlord boss because i often want to read his texts and formulate a response before responding 

And that is why read receipts are shitty. People get obsessed with knowing when people read what they sent and why have they responded back yet?! 

No one is obligated to respond right away. People are busy and many people, like you and your overbearing boss, like to formulate their own answers. 

If you're having communication issues with your wife, go to couples counselling. Even if you can see when she reads a text, it's not a guarantee she'll respond right away. YTA for pushing this. Unless her phone is broken, she's getting your texts OP."
cel1ft,NTA. I would ask her for the money back and honestly if she says no at least you know not to lend her money anymore but I would not consider her friend if she doesn’t pay you back.
cel1ky,"NTA absolutely not. You are absolutely right that you would be committing a crime for him by forging his signature and to refuse to do it.  I can't understand why he refuses to sign this, either. I'd tell him you are out of the car business at this point. Is he just irrationally stubborn and refusing to do it because he doesn't want to be told what to do (man baby alert), or is he setting you up for something?

And he is treating you like you are his mom. He needs to knock it off."
cel1mo,"NTA. You shut it down before it became a liability. If there was a real medical emergency, then she should be calling 911 regardless of who’s working. 

It’s weird that she was asking that to begin with. She’s immature for believing this was appropriate behavior and lashing out at you for placing boundaries."
cel1um,"NTA Why is diarrhea ok to joke about, but not blood? Explosive shit is far more disgusting."
cel3yu,"NTA for insisting you see a bill before paying, but it's worth adding that the cable company wouldn't be the asshole for cutting off your service if you didn't pay.

You don't have to chase them down for a bill, but if you're not paying for a service you can't get upset if they stop providing that service."
cel4fq,"ESH honestly but mostly you. Never hire family, but when you do, set clearly defined terms and expectations. A month is a ridiculously long time to paint one smallish house but six months is not that long to be cancer-free, depending on the type and severity. At this point this is just a lesson for next time, try to remember that this is a temporary situation but he is family permanently."

cel69a,Not an asshole. But you are a sick freak for living in NC without AC.
cel6oy,"NTA, but don't expect that to actually hold up. Once you're dead, people will fight over the will and your money *especially* with conditional clauses like this. Just leave him out of the will if you hate his partner and decision making so much, or leave him $5.00 so you make it clear he's excluded and has no claim that you ambiguously left him out."
cel7k8,NTA. You’ve tried to be supportive and helpful. She’s not willing to help herself
cel7lr,"NTA but I would advise you not to tell people  that you are trying to select the biological gender. I also don't think you can say that to an adoption agency.

I get it  though."
cel8ct,"Oof. NTA. Your husband should be supporting you, not acting like his money is for his gain and whatever he gives you is an allowance. You should be able to share in the happiness and, quite frankly, it sounds like he's crippling you financially. It might be good for you two to sit down and have a talk with a counselor about this, cuz this is a pretty big red flag that you have a purposefully unequal relationship."
celaxn,"NAH but have you considered that she wasn't crying because of you?   


I think you should probably speak to someone if you aren't already about your mental health, friend. I hope things get a bit better soon."
celb67,NTA. She’s being controlling and manipulative
celbxy,"NTA

Domestic cats belong inside. For their sake and for the sake of the ecosystem."

celk8p,"YTA. It’s his equipment, he’s transporting it, and training you."

celkvf,YTA she can marry when she wants.
celky2,"NTA.  If I invite you to spend the night, the basic amenities of my home are implied to be included in the deal.  You don't need my permission to shower, use the toilet, get something to drink, or even a snack from the fridge. 

The only possible exceptions there are just common decency.  Grab a glass of milk in the morning, or a beer that night, and it's fine.  But don't crack open a bottle of my 20 year old scotch.  Grab some chips or make yourself a sandwich, but don't slice and grill that pork loin I had in the fridge.  Grab an asprin if you wake up with a headache, but don't help yourself to my prescriptions. 

Basic adulting 101."
celm0a,"YTA if my boyfriend was in the ER for ANY REASON, I would be by his side. I’ve been in and out of the ER my whole life and it’s a scary, uncomfortable place. The fact that you didn’t even offer to be by his side is atrocious to me."
celnr0,"NTA, you made the right decision here. I believe that she would’ve been more heartbroken if she missed the funeral and found out later. It would have sucked to come home to such bad news, and everyone hates being the bearer of bad news, but it’s just the way life works sometimes."
celqan,Entitled people will always resent you setting a boundary.  NTA.  Glad your fiancé sided with you.
cels34,NTA this guy is an asshole. He is effectively leeching off you and Chad. He needs to move somewhere with cheaper rent or find another way to make money.
celvcr,NAH. Bedbugs can happen to anyone and I doubt they are a cause for eviction. YWBTA if you don't have them taken care of and allow them to spread.

Your coworkers suck for everything you've laid out. You're fantasizing about an I-told-you-so moment when the trip is a disaster. It feels like it'll feel good to see those smug bastards who don't appreciate you learn their lesson for belittling you and your department. I get it, there's department friction at my company too. But you know it's bad for the company, and if you want to stick around at this company it will come back to hurt you too.

Take the high road for now. Make sure your boss's bosses know that you're the hero, subtly, so that it gets you a raise/bonus this year. Play it right, and the value of your word in meetings goes up too. Come through for the team and you'll hear some ""thanks manvern, you were right, we should've listened sooner"" which feels just as good as the ITYS."

celzuj,"Just out of curiosity, what goes on at AAA meetings? Do they just teach you to change flat tires and stuff? Sounds fun."

cem9ed,"YTA. This is how new homophobic people are made. If you act like it's normal and natural, your kids will follow your lead. Kids pick up on your attitudes.

cem9fp,"YTA, it's her car and you already wrecked one"
cem9lw,"NTA I don’t think it would be fair to call your sister an asshole, but it also wouldn’t be fair for you to unfriend him.

Good luck bro"
cemafh,"Of course you have a right to deny access to your property, and she’s not entitled to anything. But holy mother of god are YTA.

cemc3p,I agree. My only regret is how I handled it but I honestly don’t think I even really managed to fully explain her actions and how harmful they could be to people (although that doesn’t justify my actions).
cemeci,NTA but you should really work out some of your trauma with a therapist. Good luck.
cemffc,"YTA if you follow this plan.



1. Who knows when the next time he asks will be. Maybe it at a friend's BBQ when he meets someone with the same name as his dad or the night before the science fair or on the way to a baseball game. Be prepared. Read articles on kids and grief. Have his favorite comfort foods. Find a time where he doesn't have to go somewhere or do homework. 


2. If you don't, then you are teaching him that you will keep important information from him. He may start to wonder what else you are keeping from him that he just hasn't asked about the right way.


3. It's okay to take a little time to process it yourself though. Tell a friend about it and use all the swear words so you get it out before talking to your kid. 


Source: have an adopted kid, have had to deliver a lot of unfortunate news about her biological family."
cemg2f,"NTA. 150% report her to HR. Do it right now. This is rude, regressive, none of her business and could actually deter women from getting care. You'll be doing yourself and every other woman who walks through those doors a kindness."
cemi5e,NTA (May be biased because of my love for animals) SAVE THIS CATS POOR LIFE if it’s really going to that kind of home please do it. But also don’t break the law in your area in the process. Maybe leave out food on your front porch so she’s comes over?
cemj9o,NTA if she wants to be like that just sign out or unplug it so when you come home you just gotta fix it and then use it. If she complains sounds like you need to tell her to get her own roku device or something
cemja9,"NTA. People die, life goes on.

cemlx3,"I would say NAH.

Most of them probably didn't know you (or your family) couldn't eat them in the first place. That said, there are alternate ways to say ""get well soon""."
cemmcu,"NTA. I think it's kind of weird for adopted sisters to be in a relationship together, but they're not biological sisters, and they haven't even been legal sisters most of their lives, so this is a unique circumstance. Although if they break up, that could make family gatherings a little weird with them."
cemnei,"NTA.

Depending on what state you live in, you can leave a polite, anonymous letter. Asking them to quiet down the dog. 

If that doesn’t work, you have right to consult with the landlord, or apartment head."
cemnkq,"NTA

You are supposed to invite significant others to weddings because, as you said, they are a package deal and it's very rude not to.

However, this isn't a traditional wedding like that and you only have 4 spots. It's pretty understandable that you didn't invite him. I wonder if he understands the limited number of guests?

Edit - judgement changed"
cempiu,NTA. It's a jerky thing to say.
cemq1b,Esh. I understand mental health is important and your hurting. But calling off effects the team and work load. You said you call off alot...and that could lead to an issue. And your boss sucks for only giving 1 day off. Wtf...that's insane
cemqax,"NTA. 

You made an honest mistake, and apologized for it/moved back. 

I think your flight attendant was being a bit of a dick, but at the end of the day they know the plane better. I’ve certainly moved seats before without asking on empty flights, but also to “same class” seats. Never had an attendant make a deal about it."
cemr6y,Nta. You care about him and love him. He will mourn for a few but he will get close to your parents. Visit him frequently if you can!!!! Its tough i know. But itll be ok.
cems4q,"NAH but I doubt you will be able to get insurance on them without them knowing. Insurers will likely require a medical exam/records, etc."

cen316,"NTA. Unless your neighbor is seriously obtuse, she knows exactly why your daughter doesn’t want to play anymore - and she’s well within her right to refuse to spend time with someone who makes her uncomfortable.

cenb30,"NAH-yet

You aren’t an ass for how you are thinking, but when push comes to shove you are gonna have to go. Your wife is more important than another couples wedding right? She’s confused and probably feeling some (unwarranted) guilt. Just help her get through it, it’s one weekend and then you can move past it. 

If you blow her off, it will last longer than a weekend."

cenc7z,NTA his car shouldn't smell like cigarettes if he's using it for Lyft. You only mentioned his kids because her brought them up.
cencwh,"YTA- you took your baby into work. 
Then left the baby with an assistant which prevented the assistant from focusing on her job, then your assistant didn’t want to be your nanny and gave the baby to an intern because she didn’t want to deal with the responsibility of dealing with a crying baby while trying to perform her job.

cenfad,"NTA.  It sounds like this girl just couldn't handle the ropes or was looking for an excuse to quit.  I frankly don't know anyone who would quit in less than two weeks unless they had some serious issues with the position.  I seriously doubt the real reason for quitting was you guys not making her ""feel welcome""."
cenffx,"NTA. The mother is overstepping by asking *you* to pay for an event you're in charge of planning. If you plan to ask people for money to help out, do it. Perhaps cover the aunt/driver because she's doing a favor."
cengmz,"NTA. The 22-year old nephew is being a selfish turd who is acting in bad faith. Running the scenario past a lawyer is totally acceptable here. You're looking for advice right now, not running headfirst into a lawsuit. Finding out your options is smart."

She made choices that have led to me making this one, she had a choice to be a better/actual parent but here we are. I have heard your opinion on this and understand that you disagree.

cenxuc,"ESH.

If she's going through stuff then giving her space and waiting to deal with the issue would be the ""best friend"" thing to do. She's obviously being a jerk, but deleting her and THEN messaging her is also immature.

If you don't want to remain friends, then there's no need to message her.

If you do want to remain friends, then simply messaging her to stop lying would be ok.

If you have witnesses and friends who aren't naive, you shouldn't have trouble clearing your name.

Messaging her at this point would only serve to deepen your rift, and maybe maaaybe provide a little catharsis."

cenzfb,"NAH, but generally it’s best not to offer suggestions on how to deal with street harassment because no matter how much you read and how great a boyfriend you are in regards to listening to her and paying attention, you will always be wrong. You are not her, you are not even a woman. She knows her life and has a lot more experience with harassment and knows how futile a lot of suggestions are.

By adulthood, women already have a million strategies to minimize the amount of harassment they get so when you, a man who’s never had to deal with it have a suggestion that took you two minutes to think of, it just comes off as patronizing, and I promise she’s already ruled it out for whatever reason. Anything you can think of, she’s had to think about this her whole life and she’s already examined your suggestion in much greater detail. 

I gave the judgement I did because you were trying to help and it is a natural instinct to offer suggestions. Best thing you can do is just be supportive, listen, offer sympathy and ask what she needs. The only thing that will stop it is if men decide to stop harassing her."
cenzgk,"I would talk to your boss first. Let him/her know you're being kept an extra 15 minutes, and ask if you can either begin the run early so you don't stay so late, or if someone can help you so you leave on time.

Don't disrespect the manager directly, just ask if together you can find a solution that works for everyone."

Whether or not you tell him now and whether that would make you an asshole is a whole other matter."
ceoiuo,"That's a tough decision. I would say you should have a long sit down conversation with him about this. If he doesn't know, maybe learning about it will spur him to report it himself. If he does know and has brushed it off, maybe you could reach out to a family member close to him that could be a neutral party and get their opinions. Having it come from someone else close may help them realize that thia is a serious concern for you and not something to be brushed off.

I think outright reporting it behind his back without at least a discussion would make YTA.

Your friends behaviour was inappropriate, especially after you told them to stop. However, blocking them and breaking up contact is an unreasonable strong reaction from you.

cepzec,"NTA. The point should be to play together. That should be enough.

The logic might be true, it probably would be the best thing to do, to go on holiday. But you know that you may not be able to force yourself to have a good time and you may well just drag her down mood-wise and ruin it for her. I don't think she's really considering that.

Maybe maturity is part of it, or maybe she just doesn't understand what it's like to be depressed.
But I think your decision is as much for her as it is for you. I don't think you're ta here."

ceqdqn,"Hello. NTA for taking care of your health. Doctors are normal people who work in an office, it’s completely ok to call the office if the gynecologist you talked to and ask them if you can use this pill with your symptoms. I’m sure they will be happy to confirm if it is safe or not. 

Don’t hesitate to stay in touch with your doctor, most of them care about your well being and will be there for you."
ceqgpo,"YTA


Sorry mate, but when kids are immersed in a culture, it's not fair to expect them to adhere to the norms of another one they've never even experienced. 


I think you need to look at it differently:


*'That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet'*


I have a stepdad in my life who has loved and brought me up since I was nine. I call him by his first name and I call my biological father Dad. 


I associate the word 'Dad' with a guy who I only saw once every couple of months. I associate my stepdad's name with love, affection and parenting. My stepdad will be on the top table at my wedding and he will be giving the father of the bride speech. He is my father in every respect; I just call him something different."
ceqhpm,"Yta. You’re splitting up a family! Even if he’s “too young to remember” right now, when he’s older and learned his Aunt adopted his sister and not him, he’d be crushed."
ceqi16,"Oh yeah mate jesus. There is no doubt here that YTA.

His ID says he is of legal age. By your own admission you say there was nothing wrong with his ID. You should have served him.

On top of that. Learning he has a disease which makes him look younger and still not serving him. Can you imagine how embarrassing that was?"
ceqiw8,"NTA.  Keep your kid away from that corrosive old lady, who is trying to use gifts for children as weapons in a fucking 4d chess proxy war.  

Don't know why you didn't tell your kid about the check, though;  he was honest with you, you should be honest with him.  Don't let your emotions about your MIL cloud your judgement about what is right by your kid."
ceqk2o,NTA.   Don’t do manual labor for free.
ceqkg4,"NTA.   Your parents need to start looking to professional respite services to take care of your brother instead of bringing him along to stay in a hotel for week.

ceqoje,"ESH, you targeted the wrong person. Your friend should have paid for her if he'd told her it would be free"
ceqtxw,"lol what a dick. Instead of saying something along the lines of “This sounds distressing and you should definitely talk about it with someone” you just made the whole incident about you. It’s not her fault if you are “a neurotic mess” and you literally encouraged her to find someone else. If it really bothers you that she is moving on so easily (yeah, who knew healthy people have more healthy interactions that sometimes lead to sex than mentally ill people) just block her on social media and move on. YTA, not for denying to help her but for acting self-centered and entitled. Literally not answering would have been better."
ceqvd0,"NTA - the average photographer charges around £1300 for a wedding which included video too, not just photos. I would advise your GF to do more shoots to diversify her portfolio ( families, babies, makeup artists etc). Her portfolio will show her worth to clients - not age."
ceqvzm,"NTA. If she’s invited and refuses to go that’s her decision. If she finds out about it after the fact, it does seem like she’s being excluded in favor of your dad."

cer7bm,"Hard NTA op, you pay this guys food and basically lead him to places to find work and he declines work. You have been very patient with him"
cer7jn,"Wrong sub. I’m sorry you’re in this situation. I would find a sub more suited so that you can get advice from people who have been carers for their ailing parents. 

Best of luck"
cer9za,"YTA. She done you a favour, for free. You offered to pay, yes, but ultimately it was still a kind gesture. Coming home from vacation is stressful and it takes a while to get back into routine. Give her time to settle and get affairs in order. It's not as simple as just sending the photos. Photographers need to upload them to a computer/laptop, go through them all to delete the bad ones, organize them all, touch them up if they wish. And then send them. It takes time and you need to be patient, seeing as it was a kindness and not a job. I will clarify, I don't neccessarily think you are being an ""asshole"" but certainly you may be coming off as rude."
cerc1n,"NTA. But you know who is also TA? Your husband! Where was he when all of this happened? Why has he not defended you, or made sure you didn't have to visit someone that insulted you and dragged you down? Where is he in this story? Not yelling at his mother to respect his wife whom he loves and wants to spend his life with, apparently.

Be aware that not accepting the gift will be a slap in your MIL's face while it seems that she's actually mending her ways. Regardless of the reason, if she's making an effort and you throw it into her face, many people will see you as TA as well instead of the victim who's finally drawn a line and no longer wishes to have contact with her abuser. But you are well within your rights to refuse."
cerc86,"1) it may have been a clumsy translation 

2) I think it’s okay to mention the current project/life’s work of those who were killed. I’m assuming those killed were artists/animators/etc who I’m sure were passionate about the films they created.

cerqkj,I would report it. Whether he gets fired isn't up to you. You will have to explain why it took you 11 hours
cerr8r,"NTA.  If she still doesn't get it, explain it's like you saying something along the lines of ""I only date girls who are double D's so we are breaking up"" and then maybe she'll understand."
cervjc,NTA. The reason uber has the ability to report is for situations like this.
cerxmv,"You mean WIBTA if you *don’t* hire her, right? Definitely NTA. It would potentially create a whole bunch of awkward situations for no good reason.

cery5s,"NTA... Slim chance, but maybe a lesson learned by her."
cerz07,"NAH. She asked if you could recommend her, and you can't. A recommendation puts your reputation on the line. She was a little presumptuous in asking, but not sufficiently so to constitute an asshole; she may have enjoyed working with you even if that experience wasn't mutual. In any case, polite professionalism is appropriate. 

Now, will she consider you an asshole? Likely. But that doesn't mean she's right."
ces17b,"NTA - you asked the normal, human, not-a-complete-dumbass question. Your friend is a nitwit and so is her boyfriend."

cesft3,"NAH if you guys talk about how the money situation has changed. I admit giving his ex money for ""stuff"" is kinda dumb but realistically she's gonna take that money out of the kid's funds if he doesn't. I can see how mentally that puts him in a tough spot.

Now however, it's your earnings he's burning. That changes things. When he gets a job he can go back to doing what he wants but for now he's literally borrowing money from you to pay for child support. Make sure he understands that you're not an infinite well of cash and while you support him and his child, you're not going to support her."

Your mother likely refuses to get involved because she’ll probably agree with you and doesn’t want to make your brother feel bad for wanting a relationship with your father."
ceteiu,NTA. A vacation isn't what they need. If this kid is really a danger then they need to solve the problem and get him some help and you should help and support them in getting it.

But I don’t think it needs to be this conscious light switch choice either. Keep putting in a little effort with the understanding that you probably won’t become super close to her and that’s okay. In ten or fifteen years you will become the cool older sibling with an established life and you two might become closer as she matures. If you completely shut that door now you might miss out on a good relationship when she is older."

Yeah, it's your baby too, but it's her body. I don't know the relationship your partner has with your mom, but it's pretty normal for a person to not want someone ELSE'S mom at their appointment."
cetoux,"YTA. Its been two weeks and your still going on about it. You can't force him to apologize or dictate how his relationship is with his parents. I think if you look deeper you may fine your real issue is you want to see change in his ways and hoping that if he changes his approach with his parents you can be more assured that the changes he has made with you will stick. 

But at the end of the day, the relationship with his family is his to destroy if he so chooses and even if not, he has made it clear his position and what actions he is willing to take. To continue on about it makes you an asshole cause you are trying to force him to do what he has made clear he doesn't plan on doing."

ceu4wr,"NAH 

Your father stands financially with the back to the wall. I guess, you need to accept that he probably really cannot pay you more. He doesn't come across as an exploitative person, therefore, I guess, he would pay you more if he could. 

On the other hand, your request is fully legit. No one likes to work for bad payment.

He shouldn’t have lent you money if he couldn’t pay bills without it later, but you should have been more cognizant in paying him after he told you he really needed it back.

Both of you should probably be proactive about this and go see a sleep specialist. She needs to get to the root of her insomnia, and you need to get help with your snoring and at least confirm that it won’t lead to you dying from sleep apnea in the future.

Edit: your edit doesn’t help a lot, it’s mostly you assuming what doctors would say and using that as an excuse not to go. That’s not a solution."
cevcj6,"Oh my fucking God, NTA. If he wants different food he should cook it himself, you're not a short-order cook."
cevdur,"NAH - unless the shirt was profane or vulgar, you are free to wear it. If the staff had an issue with it they could have asked you to change.  At the hospital my daughter went through all of their clothes were checked for appropriateness. I’m assuming this was the case for you too, and if it passed, it’s fine."
cevfmv,"ESH. He did some very sucky things, but it seems like you pulled out that photo mostly because you were upset about being rejected in that moment. Educating someone that they're being offensive is not AHish, but trying to use it as a weapon because you're hurt is sort of sucky. You should have separated that from him saying he doesn't want to be with you."
cevhu9,"~~NTA~~ NAH

You are consenting adults and you have been honest with them. There is no need for a guilty conscious here.

Edit: Changed to NAH, because friend is not an asshole either."
cevmkn,[deleted]
cevo6m,That doesnt excuse her behavior.
cevory,"NTA.  You used the information you had and made your intentions clear, then backed off at the first no.  Seems perfectly fine.  But this sub is generally super against asking anyone out ever, so good luck."
cevqdc,"NTA. She could have taken literally five seconds to tell you where your child was going to be, and she honestly should have. If she hadn't responded soon you would have every right to get the police involved, but I doubt they would have been happy once things got sorted out."
cevstm,"NTA.

She's welcome to either rent it or buy it off you with that 500k she now has.

She even had the option to pick it and she herself thinks money is more important.

Of course you're feeling guilty, that's what a GUILT TRIP is supposed to do to it's victim!

Your sister is 100000000000000000000000% in the wrong here."
cevvq8,How is that even a prank?
cevxs5,NTA. You were a paying customer and have the right to sit where you want.
cevy0y,"YTA, firstly how do you know that car wasn't his home and secondly on what power exactly were you going to get him towed? 'Excuse me, police, he's poor, tow his car'?

cew0va,"YTA for acting like they should restructure their lives around you. They aren't trying to exclude you. 

However, friends naturally drift apart all the time because their interests no longer intersect, so if these friendships have run their course just move on. Don't be a drama queen about it or act like you're a victim. It sounds like you can still hang out with them if you want to, you'd just rather not."
cew2r2,"NTA. Healthy boundaries are necessary and normal, and I’d be leery of anyone threatened by them."
cew3hm,"ESH. You recognize that health is a priority, and you and your coworker are in the same boat. Chances are, she also knows how much harm she is doing to her body by maintaining an unhealthy diet- she doesn't need you to point this out. 

**She is making fun of you to make herself feel better. You would be making fun of her to make her feel bad.** See the difference? Both of you would be hurting the other, but you would be specifically doing it for the purpose of harming her, while she is doing it to make herself feel better. Neither is a justifiable reason for cruel words, and it would be out of line for you to retaliate in this manner.

Instead, just talk to her, and tell her that these jokes make you uncomfortable, and that you really do care about your health, and you would appreciate her support in your efforts, or even just ambivalence, rather than mockery. Hopefully, you won't have to escalate this further."
cew3u9,NTA. Its only fun if everyone is an equal participant. Just let them know politely that you only want to communicate professionally going forward.
cew6gl,"Left her overnight, sure YTA.

Left her 20 minutes? Nope. NTA. She shouldn't be so aggressive if she wants your help."
cew797,I like to think of myself as pretty active.  Im not overweight and i start on the basketball team. But right now its litteraly way too hot to go outside
cew8cd,NTA. That’s not your problem that she went over budget. Frankly it is weird to have two baby showers per child.
cew8u2,"YTA. Let's skip your rational point about painting nails and get to the root of the issue. Having her nails painted gives her confidence and comfort when entering an interview and she sees you as the person who is saying that those two things aren't worth $30 bucks or whatever. You are not paying for her nails. You are paying for her peace of mind, confidence, and sense of preparedness. Now that I've reframed what's happening - is it more ""worth it""?"
cewava,NTA. You didn't refuse. You set a very logical restriction due to the known facts.
cewc0t,NTA This relationship is not just toxic.  It is abusive.  Cain is abusive to Maddie.  You should try to help your friend recognize this (she may and most likely will) deny and cut you off.  Try to stay in her life if you can.  I suggest going to a local women's shelter/help center or whatever you have to get material and meet with someone to see if they can offer advice.
cewdut,YTA - you cut the line with ELEVEN PEOPLE?? Huge asshole move
cewfcz,"NAH, a bad drink is a bad drink. Criticism can only help one improve."
cewiv9,"YTA, kind of. You're only there for a week, I'm sure he was enjoying his time with you. 
If you were just playing around on tinder and not taking it seriously, I'm sure he thought it was just a joke and didnt think youd actually ditch him."
cewkb7,"NTA. 

> this isn’t what my ex would’ve wanted.

And a ""who cares"" erupts from crowd."
cewmq4,Going against the grain and saying YTA if you didn't let her know. Revenge porn is a crime because it is a violation of a person's rights in an extremely humiliating way. You should give her the opportunity to do what she is entitled to: get justice for what's been done to her.
cewodc,"Definitely complain about the one who’s having vulgar and loud conversations and talking about inappropriate things at work. 

But if the only offensive thing about the other one is chatting and listening to music, I’d leave her alone (you don’t explain what you mean by “no class” - that’s a subjective judgment). It’s possible to work while listening to music. Of course, if she’s also vulgar and objectively unprofessional, that’s a different story."
cewofu,"YTA, maybe he's just there to help motivate and or spot his friend.  Unless he's making unwanted sexual advances his presence alone should not be an issue"
cewpd7,"YTA. There are almost no circumstances in which it's ever okay to out someone. ""My boyfriend is insecure"" is not one of the exceptions."
cewpfg,"NTA / She’s making other artists lose money. It’s the same thing as pirating music, but selling it, too. Please call her out and help out the art community."
cewsck,NTA but if he really is lying to you about this then he is going to cause problem after problem in your marriage.
cewtzu,NTA. Your family is ridiculous. I know the frustration all too well
cewue4,"Shes OBVIOUSLY unequivocally TA here, you gave perfectly valid reasons.  But if shes tripping over something so small then what else can she get mad about ? Theres a saying in Spanish ""quieres conocer andres vive con el un mes""  or in English ""if you want to get to know this person , live with them for a month. "" 

Make sure you have a plan in place for possible eviction proceedings as these things can turn sour very quickly.  Shes long distance and you probably havent gotten to know her quirks and misgivings.  Perhaps a notorized contract"
cewuzs,NTA. But be careful. In a lot of states/locations— two weeks is plenty of time to establish tenancy and you may need to legally evict them.
cewx96,"ESH. If you and your sister aren’t close, I think you overstepped by making a dig at her, especially at a wedding in front of everyone. Even if it was a joke, I don’t get the sense that you two frequently joke around like that.

On the other hand, she was being kinda judgey to you afterwards. I get her being mad about the joke but I don’t get her being mad at you for smoking pot since she drinks."
cex0xy,NTA. She sounds like a pill.
cex11w,"NTA.

&#x200B;

Anyone who creates this much family drama over an accidentally crushed flower is an asshole. A big one."
cex2in,"~~INFO~~: Did your friend know you had issues with this girl? If not, nobody's an asshole, but if he did then he  obscured who she was for a reason.

&#x200B;

EDIT: After OP's responses, I'm going with NTA. This friend manipulated and lied his way through the situation because he knew OP would have an issue with his girlfriend, that isn't fair to OP who was already a plan of this vacation and should be able to enjoy it."
cex3g5,"NTA - you take care of yourself first. How the business runs without you, and how other people manage the work are not your responsibilities, and the guilt around things like that is a tool bad managers use to exploit people who would otherwise have no qualms about walking away."
cex6z7,"NAH, pretty normal not to tip at counter-service places."
cex99i,"YTA, honestly why are you so upset? They didn’t want the extra work of a dog then, and do now (probably a direct cause of you moving out). Let them be happy, you have a dog now, everything is fine."
cexar4,"...yes, YTA for intentionally bumping into people to make a point.

You're in Boston. Save that shit for the drive home."
cexcrb,"NTA- bad roommates can ruin friendships. I stopped being friends with my BFF for two years after we lived together for the same reasons. We eventually became friends again, but under no circumstances would I ever live with her again...I almost said ESH for using “ghetto” to describe her cleaning habits. Just no.."
cexen9,"Uh....NTA, what are you supposed to do, abort the baby?

Not a rhetorical question, or sarcastic- what does your mother think you should be doing in this situation"
cexgu7,"YTA. I understand your reasoning here, but ultimately, it is her decision. If she wants to go, the best thing you can do is support her in that. If you can go with her to the funeral, all the better."
cexh5u,NAH but at least take it down when mom comes over.
cexhxu,ESH- You cancelled it with the best intentions in mind but it would have been best to consult your friend first. In fact it would probably be the best if you offer to reimburse the cost if possible.
cexji3,"INFO:  While I'm inclined to say NTA for being upset that you were lied to, I feel like there is more to this story.  The fact that all your friends and family knew and were keeping this from you says...something.

And the way you say ""I'm not a fan of drugs of any kind, obviously this includes cigarettes.""  I dunno.  I can't help but get the feeling we're not getting the whole picture here if every single person you know decided it was best to keep you in the dark."
cexk1e,"NTA. He lied and it sounds like he made the party for him, not you."
cexnil,"NTA.  Your husband could have told you in advance, which would have affected your decision to stay with them.  Or your FIL could just be modest while you're staying in their home, out of politeness.  It's unfortunate that you had to leave early but you're not the a-hole here."
cexov7,"This is an interesting premise. I'm going with NTA for a few reasons with *one proviso*: if you've asked the parents what to buy for your niece and nephew, and then you reject that and do your own thing, then I think you'd be TA. If this is you thinking hard about what you'd really like to get them, then you wouldn't be TA, in my opinion. Here's my rationale for NTA:

Firstly, her parents can buy their daughter all the princess stuff they'd like. As you said, they're reasonably well off, so it doesn't seem like it'll break the bank. Secondly, I love the idea of getting presents that are more thought provoking - *especially* ones that show girls that they *can* and *should* study STEM! Lastly, I feel that it's really up to you to decide which gifts you'd like to get for your niece and nephew (see proviso above)."
cexpaj,"NTA - but is HR going to have three people not use the elevator to suit *one* person, or are they going to ask *you* to use the stairs?  

HR is there for the *company,* not for you"
cexpe6,[deleted]
cexq4e,"NTA, he sounds completely manipulative and I wouldn’t want to be near him either. On the sort of bright side, he probably won’t be with your sister for long, given his history."
cexs0e,"NTA: This is a cut and dry case of “if you see something, say something.” This guy sounds possessive and almost exhibits tendencies of an obsessive stalker like character. Your report to HR might save her from something horrible."
cexsmk,"NTA

Your mother acts like she knows you better than you do, and that's super frustrating"
cextlt,"NTA. This is unspoken concert code or at least it should be. If you show up early, you deserve the spot you’re in. Doesn’t matter if the other person is short, can’t see, it’s their birthday, they’re with a friend, etc. Sadly, people suck!"
cexvbe,"NTA but goddamn did your mom really say ""get the d*ck out of your ass""???"
cexx7o,[deleted]
cexzco,"NTA, but I definitely think that you should start to distance yourself from those people."
cey0ok,"NTA

You cancelled because it wasn't fair to your GF for you to meet.  That's a reasonable thing to do.

New ex-girlfriend violated your privacy and was quick to dump you without talking to you or thinking about it.  

I think your new ex was impulsive here and she saved you the trouble by ending it."
cey1de,"NTA, it sounds like it's about time for you to stand up for yourself (very difficult, I know, but very necessary!). Make sure to do it professionally, though. Think of what you're going to say beforehand. And prepare for her reactions: what will you do if she gets mad, ignores you, denies everything? Because if you allow yourself to be surprised by her then she will likely walk all over you again. Best of luck!!"
cey1fl,"NTA. Heat stroke is nothing to fuck with.

Edit: also, sometimes plans just don't work out for whatever reasons. Its understandable for her to be miffed but she needs to get over it."
cey333,"She has never gotten physical.  She always acts apologetic after she freaks out and just expects my brother and me to instantly forgive her.  Writing this has sort of been therapeutic.  I know she is trying her best, but she always tries to make everything about her.  I also left out how she feels about what I want to do in college.  I talked with her about going into art school and becoming a graphic designer, and her response was something along the line of, ""I would try and get good at bartending because you might not find a job as an artist."""
cey3jx,"YTA

This was not a personal attack at you.  I think she's just bad at conversation but was trying to make some."
cey50k,NTA. Just don't be surprised if it doesn't go down too well.
cey8bm,NTA. Your brother needs help. Your parents should have looked into every social service he qualified for right after his brain injury. Your best bet to to call social services in your area and explain the situation. Hopefully he will be assigned a social worker and can start being enrolled in programs for counseling and housing.
cey8u2,"ESH:

...........................yeeeeeeeeah no comment on this one"
cey9vj,"YTA.

Personally I don't care which side of this argument you're on. I'm a progressive lefty as well, but you gotta stand up for what you believe in. 

But hey, you've got a great start in the GOP if you're already doing things that you don't even believe in for money."
ceybw4,YTA ...it's called zippering and you are meant to use both lanes until closure
ceycgx,"YTA. If you owed him money and had no intention of asking for the cash back, then him going to the concert with his new SO shouldn’t change that. You owed him money, period."
ceyev2,i am not talking about cases where they're uninterested. there's a girl who keeps texting me even when i leave her on read. we used to be friends but i eventually got fed up with feeling like an entertainer- telling stories and getting only laughing emojis back so i stopped replying. she's not a bad person/doesn't mean harm but i don't feel comfortable talking if i am not getting enough engagement back
ceyfqq,"If he's asking to use you as a reference, that's him not knowing how to read a room, and his fault. 

NTA."
ceyggg,"NTA:

She sucks for expecting you to completely remake her drinks over pretty much nothing, but I'd also put some of the blame on you for actually conforming to her standards and holding up a line of 8 people. You should've stopped listening to her a long time ago tbh"
ceyjya,"I don’t see how they couldn’t make you a salad, this sounds fake tbh"
ceykdh,"NTA.

If the agreed to the rule and then went back on their word then they’re the asshole, but I agree with other commenters that this rule is unenforceable and likely illegal.  Don’t report them, it will only get you involved in additional drama."
ceyl1q,"YTA for feeling entitled, it’s their money, left to them. It does suck that you lost financial aid and they aren’t helping pick up the slack, but that’s their choice. Can you go to a less expensive college? $70,000 a year is a lot."
ceyl3o,"NTA. A white dress at someone else's wedding? That's a *hard* no. 

>I don't know how she doesn't know you don't wear white to a wedding 

I don't know either. In fact, I literally don't believe that she doesn't know this. Does she have some kind of beef with you right now, or is she always spiteful like this?

Tell her no and be firm. Also, have a backup outfit ready to go on the day of for when she surprises you by showing up in her own goddamn wedding gown."
ceyldq,"YTA - she is an adult and you're just mad because she's not as codependent as you are. 

&#x200B;

>I was kind of offended by that tbh, I’m with her a lot to make sure she’s okay, why wouldn’t she want to spend our free time together? 

Bro this is not healthy."
ceyt6h,"NTA. What a weird lie...minor, but I think calling him out on it is being honest and letting him know you won't be tolerating blatant lies."
ceyv0f,[deleted]
ceyvvz,He isn’t worth it.
ceyvyw,"NAH.

I wouldnt call you an asshole for feeling the way you do, but your dad doesn't sound all that bad actually from what you have described. He wasnt absent from your life, he just wasnt as emotionally available as you would have liked. I suppose you can have a conversation with him about it, but I wouldn't be as accusatory as your title here. Just stick to your feelings, and try to hear him out as well. It might improve your relationship."
ceyx5a,"NTA

Going to a party implies everything is taken care of. Paying your own way is not a party, its just plans."
ceyz2b,"NTA. You didn't give her permission nor did she ask. Put that together and that equals stealing. She stole $500 from you,not an insignificant amount of money. I'd probably be even more pissed. She sounds extremely entitled."
ceyzyr,YTA for being a bit entitled and overly sensitive.  The sheets thing is a common courtesy request - you should know if you're staying at someone else's cabin that it's just polite to change the sheets and tidy up when you leave.  She shouldn't have to tell you that and you shouldn't get offended if she does.
cez00o,NTA I think you're correctly assessing the mechanic's intentions.  That's how you get customers and referrals.
cez18n,"NTA, you were trying to prevent the person from getting a needless ticket/towed. You did the right thing."
cez1oz,"YTA

You don't need to get rid of the dog, you need to train the dog.  Dogs don't come setup and ready to go, you have to put in the work.  Everything you described can be corrected abs managed with proper training. The dog has no idea it is doing anything wrong unless you teach it differently."
cez3bm,NTA. The sofa isn't allowed to be there and it's inconvenient. End of story.
cez3np,NTA offer to have the party elsewhere but this is a deal breaker for you. I wouldn't throw a party for someone being that unreasonable
cez5ex,"YTA. So she's gotten herself in a stable financial position and she should bail you out of your premarital debt? If it was debt you accrued during the marriage I would agree, but she has zero obligation to simply give you half of her inheritance, nor should she."
cez5vw,"ESH except his girlfriend. Send her the screenshots. If she shits on you, that's your punishment for knowingly fucking her boyfriend."
cez6rm,"NTA

Question - How are things with your family? If it’s good, then simply *replace them* by favoring your family on social media. 

*Phase 1*

* Post a picture with your sister naming her “the best Aunt ever!” or “Number 1 Aunt!”. 

* Do the same thing with your parents, insinuating they’re the only grandparents that will matter to your kid since they are the only ones mentioned..

* Give your close friends Aunt and Uncle status.

*Phase 2*

* Reach out directly to your husband’s aunts/uncles/grandparents who do not favor the Ex and/or *have* been welcoming to you. 

* Start inviting them over, going with them to brunch, and include them with updates of the pregnancy

* Invite them to your baby shower during the planning, but drop a last minute invite to your husband’s immediate family the day before

* Make a big deal for their birthdays and show up to events important to them. Decline going to any birthdays or events for your husband’s siblings and MIL.

*Phase 3*

* After the baby is born, only invite husband’s extended family to see the baby the next day in the hospital. Do not extend hospital invite to MIL or husband’s siblings.

* Post happy photos of the baby with your family, your shared friends, and husband’s aunt/uncle/unbiased extended relatives

* Refer to your parents as new grandma and grandpa; Have your child refer to MIL and FIL by name, starting with you never referring to them as grandparents to your child, (e.g., when talking to your baby, “Hey look baby, Michael and Jane are here”).

They will reap what they sow. They’re picking his high school Ex over their son so they don’t get to be treated as grandparents."
cez7rw,"NTA. I would not allow myself to be in a position where I was alone with a young female (or male, for that matter), as it's not enough these days to simply do no wrong. 

Youth programs all have the same stance, where you need at least 2 adults at all times. It not only protects the children from abuse but the adults from false accusations. The college students are definitely assholes for spreading rumors about you, so you can see my point.

Protect yourself. Recording your sessions could be one way, or meeting in public places (library, coffee shop, college campus) could be another."
cez9oj,NTA- no megaphones is a reasonable request.
cez9rz,"NTA, my brother did something similar and I stopped cooking for him. Only cook for yourself or others who are clear. And if they pull the I don't know. Well the answer is in their answer. ""Know"" sounds like a no to me."
cezakg,"NTA remember, you are also a role model for the kids.  Her kids are going to watch her walk over people.  They need to see someone stand up to her because they are going to need to stand up to her too."
cezblj,LOL. You're not an asshole I think you're just socially awkward. I would have looked at you funny and maybe laughed at you but I wouldnt have kicked you out of the group. Good story
cezbqk,NTA. Your dad needs to learn how to let this go.
cezf0c,I genuinely don't understand why you would think you might be entitled to compensation here. You bought the cheese without talking to your family. They  obviously are not obliged to pay you for not eating cheese you bought of your own accord. YTA.
cezff3,"YTA 
Your mother has no responsibility for your mood relating to your keys and you father taking them with hi . Ultimately you could choose not to be pissed off about that and accept it instead, rather than carrying the bad mood to your mother. Who imo rightfully asked you not to you for snapping at her unnecessarily.
It was ten seconds and it doesn’t really matter. You didn’t stop the food either."
cezghl,"NTA

You did the right thing by telling them all their stuff (which is no longer their stuff) is gone so they leave you alone."
cezj3u,NTA. My friend gave me a Vera Bradley wallet once. I doubt Vera had me in mind when it was constructed.  I don’t see how your gift closet is any different than a retail shop where the lady who is offended does her shopping.
cezmd5,Lmao you've obviously never worked at a gas station. This attendant was an idiot. There are buttons on our computer that you can input gallons vs dollars she just didn't know how to run her register 😂😂
cezpbe,NTA lol this is hilarious rage.
cezqft,NTA. You shouldn't feel pressured into wearing something.
cezsxe,"YTA, don't require screenings just don't let them see the kid until they get their shit together. The screening itself is a little much. Also what are they gunna do to pass an STD to the kid? I thought by nature of their name they are ""sexually"" transmitted?"
cezvo6,YTA you’re like 3 times removed from this and telling someone else who’s not involved to meddle in a third-party’s relationship
cezww9,"NAH: it’s a fine response.

Context is key... it’s standard bullshit work humour. It’s not split your side funny, but it creates a sense of oneness with your other interns and the CEO will know they pay you shit too.

Don’t worry about it, everyone is just being mega sensitive. 

Although I would say... stop telling random people in your life this story. It really isn’t of note and infact the retelling of it to others is less professional, than the initial joke. Just let it go and move on."
cezyht,"NTA

Turn that asshole over to the wolves. He will reap what he sowed."
cf02e5,NAH. You were playing a game that could get rough. But I can see why he might be upset cause you hit him in the head. Sounds like an accident.
cf04i8,">I always try to be considerate when I smoke. Take my butts/ashes with me, stay WELL away from other people, and generally try not to cause a fuss.

I don't know if you're an asshole, but you might be some kind of unicorn."
cf04vg,NTA man that's what reviews are for! Sounds like these guys were real pieces of work
cf068e,NTA. I wouldn't even take *him* at this point.
cf06du,"NAH 

I would feed the child what he likes to eat. Within reason of course but as close as possible."
cf07yp,NAH - You were uncomfortable and I can say from experience that having a full brightness screen is annoying as fuck. But you also woke up this lady from sleep so you can't blame her for being a bit cranky.
cf0dss,"NAH.  I mean you can certainly ask for it, but it doesn't mean they have to refund it.  Technically the dog still lived there, albeit briefly."
cf0epc,"NTA.  He went through your stuff without asking and took back something he specifically gave you.  You didn't even ask for it in the first place, he offered it."
cf0fr4,"NAH.   Your sister sounds like a really wonderful person, but I don't think it makes you a bad person if you don't want to deal with a violent kid.  I know you feel bad, but you didn't sign up to take this kid on. 

Is he in therapy?"
cf0g4b,"NAH.  I've always thought it was weird to say ""bless you"" after someone sneezes.  This usually occurs to me about 5 seconds after someone has sneezed and I've said, ""bless you."""
cf0h6k,NTA.  I think your mom is the asshole here unless we aren't hearing the entire story from every perspective.
cf0m1h,NAH as long as you are sure to include her in other activities and maybe have some non-drinking nights when you can have fun with her.
cf0m2w,"NTA. These are NOT YOUR FRIENDS. 

They didn't invite you until the last minute ONLY because they couldnt find anyone else. You're on their back burner. Blow that flame tf out."
cf0m70,Info: Are they your legos or shared legos?
cf0nim,"NAH. First of all, I am so, so sorry about your loss. 

Your brother shouldn’t have kicked you out of your own mom's funeral. But from his perspective: he watched his sibling get into recovery from an addiction, is dealing with his mom's passing, then at the funeral has to deal with the fact that you relapsed? Also, he probably viewed it as disrespectful to your mom, which is definitely not how you meant it. People do things when they grieve that they wouldn’t do in other contexts. That goes for both of you, hence my judgment. 

I hope you’re taking steps to ensure that you remain sober."
cf0omx,"NTA with an asterisk.

Your bio dad sounds like he's really fallen down on his responsibilities as a parent, and the fact that he's starting another family and putting up miles and miles between you on a semi-permanent basis is the icing on the cake. He needs to show you that he's prepared to do the work to be your dad, and I couldn't blame you for not wanting to deal with him if he won't.

BUT.

Going no contact with a parent, especially at your age, is a game-changing decision, and one your relationship with him might never recover from.

I have amended my judgement after the edits OP put in recently, while I don’t think OP should be pressured into buying alcohol if they’re not comfortable, for me their whole attitude is coming across as a massive, self centred asshole who won’t do a favour for their family. 

Their attitude has made me doubt the original story and I wonder what’s been left out, have left my original judgement below. 

—————————————

Original Judgement was Not the Asshole: if your parents want to break the law and provide alcohol to someone underage, that's on them.

cf2m73,"This is difficult to judge namely because there are a lot of social queues and subtle expressions in real life that cannot be fully grasped through text. Nonetheless, I will try my best to critique the situation. 

An individual should respect your privacy, and does not have the right to photograph you directly *unless* you are on a public property, such as a city square, which I believe does not apply to a classroom setting. Upon the lady in your story being told by you directly to stop photographing you, she should have unhesitatingly complied. However, I want to highlight something. 

> She comes back up, this time lucky enough to escape my attempt to take her phone again, and I vault over the table, and she tries to get away, and I’m trying to get her phone again as she’s sat on another table trying to get away, obviously enjoying irritating me, trying to have a laugh.

This segment could be interpreted as her being playful. Maybe she didn't realise she was actually bothering you? When you say you tried chasing her while she tried to get away, it sounds like something that she might think of as you playing along with her.

>  I picked up her bottle of water and flung it at her, barely missing her.

No matter how inappropriate her behavior, this does not give you the justification to throw objects at her, unless it was in some way a form of self-defense, which it clearly is not in this case. Something light like a crunched up piece of paper is harmless, but a full water bottle (if it was full) can hurt.

> The first girl once again trys to photo me, and in an act of escalated rage I pick up my own water bottle - a solid, hard plastic one that’s meant to be refilled unlike the other one - and throw it on the ground before storming out, and slamming the door.

This indeed sounds like none other but a fit of rage. You took what is presumably a rather strong and sturdy water bottle and threw it on the ground with enough force to spill its contents. Again, by this point they should have been leaving you alone, but your reaction is by no means tame.

I want to reiterate that without actually being present at the scene of this incident, I cannot fully realize the situation as it occurred. It sounds like there may have been some innocent play, but such behavior could be equally construed as being malicious teasing in nature rather than playful. I don't believe your response was appropriate either way however. 

As a final judgement, I would say ESH. She should've left you alone; you shouldn't  have reacted so aggressively."

You two need to be a united front, against anyone and anything, or else the marriage isn't worth much.

You're clearly between a rock and a hard place, and I don't envy you for that. It's a question of competing loyalties- but in this case your wife has been ostracized by your entire family and is clearly very upset about this. You need to be on her side, and she needs to see that you are on her side. In the same way, your family needs to see that you are on her side if they are ever going to accept her and apologize for how they have treated her.

EDIT: Based on OP's edit- the wife is definitely not the asshole. She got into an argument because she was defending a neglected dog against an ungrateful guest in her home. This, of course, means that the husband and the sister suck even more- the husband for not defending his wife despite her being in the right, and the sister for turning a whole family against a woman to defend her own shitty behavior. As several commenters below remark- this is not just about a wedding. It's about OP letting this get to the point where his sister believes that she can get away with inviting him and not his wife- and believing (correctly) that he will actually accept this state of a affairs- in which his family will never accept or respect his wife."

YTA even more for even bringing this up."

Good for you. 

What you are doing right now in behavioral conditioning terms is called “extinction.” In other words, every time this woman complained, you previously gave her reinforcement in the form of spending time with her, listening to her, and validating her complaints. This unfortunately only served to increase and maintain her behavior, because it was being continually reinforced. 

By removing the reinforcement (your attention), her behavior should eventually decrease and cease. Any time extinction is enacted, there is usually a “response burst” where the behavior initially increases in frequency and intensity. That’s what you’re seeing now. 

Here’s the tricky part. You CANNOT give in. See this is where most parents screw up. They plan to ignore their kid whining for a toy. They do it for a little while. The kid’s whining increases. The parent gets annoyed or embarrassed and they eventually give in and give the kid the toy. Know what the kid learns? “Ah! All I have to do is whine more and daddy gives me what I want!”

Do you want to teach this lady that all she has to do is complain louder and longer and eventually she’ll get her way? No you do not. 

So hold firm. You and your boyfriend have to be a united coalition in parenting her here. 

Good luck!

Edit: Thanks, kind stranger, for the golden kudos! You’re my first. Tee hee."
cf6vnr,"NTA.

I had the exact same issue with brother. Mom babied him and never punished so he grew up a POS. Take everything away and give her nothing. When asked, stay calm and explain your position clearly. You may even want to practice. You need to train her since your mom didn't. 

Set your boundries and demand respect."
cf6w7k,"NAH

I think your concerns are well founded and evidence point to your wife having an alcohol issue. But of course no one of us can diagnose this for certain. 

Your reaction is understandable, because you are afraid of your family falling apart and some more serious health issues she could get. However, one of the core points in getting away from an alcohol addiction is that the person himself needs to realize his problem and he must willingly try to quit it. He cannot be forced into it. So, probably you should focus your energy on helping your wife understand for herself that she has an issue."
cf70a3,"NTA - neither are your parents, I'm not sure what 18-year-old would be interested in someone who is 15, legal or not, though."
cf741s,"NTA No, you are not the asshole. I understand that her boyfriend is focused on his mom, but thats not an excuse to treat your sis like she is a worthless piece of shit which you can just throw away.

I am not an expert in love, heck, I never had a gf, but one thing is sure: He isnt good for her and she should break up with him as fast as possible"
cf749r,"YTA You are overstepping here, as your girlfriend pointed out. You say you understand autism is a thing, but you don't understand what they live with on a day to day basis, and so should not be telling them they need to put him in public school. You may not think they are doing him any favors, but you have no idea how he might deal with being put in a public school situation. It is very doubtful their son has outgrown his behaviors.

I understand you thinking your gf shouldn't be the one covering their bills, but she is obviously doing what she feels is best."
cf74bo,ESH- Your friends suck for not communicating or RSVPing but you suck for cancelling on the people who did confirm. You basically told them they weren't a good enough reason to come over to your home.
cf7azf,[deleted]
cf7blu,"NTA: she doesn't value your friendship and you should realign your expectations in light of this. 

You don't need this level of entitlement, no one ""gets"" to be friends with people, it's build and it takes two to build it."
cf7chv,"YTA — not for your sentiment, but for the delivery:

>**telling** my wife 

>that we **have to** move

>**even if she doesn’t want to**

You are not the dictator of your family. A marriage is a partnership. If you have a grievance—especially one which, if you get your way, will move your family to the other end of the globe—bring it up in a respectful way and plead your case. This should be a discussion, not a demand.

That said, yeah, man. That sucks. Get your kids to Aus.

**EDIT:** I completed the quote because some salty people are getting hung up on the verb “tell”  and ignoring what was told."
cf7gus,"YTA.

For disrespecting your friends parents efforts and discipline their daughter as they see fit and protecting her at the same time. 

YTA for not respecting your parents that are trying to respect your friends parents. And who are trying to protect you as well inspite of yourself.

YTA. You are 16 and posting cleavage and butt shots. That shit stays on the internet FOREVER. Sexual predators abound on social media. Don't you get that yet? And comments from those pictures could lead quickly to sexting which can be against the law depending on whom it is to... like other 16 year olds. Also, in 2(?) years when applying to colleges or internships and future jobs, guess what boob and butt shots could come back to haunt you? People have been turned down jobs for less. 

Quit being a disrespectful and thoughtless child and have respect for yourself and your body..  but if not then at least for your parents and your friends parents. They love you and are trying to keep you from doing stupid shit that could leave lasting consequences. If I was your parent I would take away those thongs you got as well."

I'd advise that you just keep it to yourself that you're glad, honestly. Don't spite the living for the dead's crimes."
cf82e8,"NTA. She decided to buy the food, you didn't ask her to pick anything up etc. Therefore she should expect to pay for it. And on a very expensive paid for vacation I think you're right, she's quibbling 10EUR."

But,  having said that,  if you're holding a joint party,  it needs to be about both of you. 

You can't make her birthday celebration?  If she can catch up,  that's great. If not,  treat it as just one of those things.  You organise a celebration in what ever form you want for your birthday.  If she can come,  that's great as well.  If not,  you'll both live. Maybe you need to take a step back and look at what's important for you,  not just what suits her."

cf8v7n,"Then YWBTA for leaving. 

You want it cancelled because you feel adults who have the choice to attend will make bad decisions. 

The committee wants it held because some people will want to attend and have already made preparations, which includes time, effort, and money. 

Make an announcement that the picnic is still on, will be outside, it's hot as hell, so you recommend everyone make good choices (sunscreen, water, etc.). Then stay on the committee so that when it comes up next year you can help prevent situations like this.

I'm sure you've changed too from when you were in your 20s. And when you put the younger picture of her as your lock screen, she may have felt like you were saying that she used to be prettier than she is now or that she is less attractive now than she was before. Basically, instead of being stubborn about her insecurity, you should support her and reassure her that you love her and find her attractive at her current age."

You call it a safe space, but that girl probably didn't feel safe at all.  It doesn't matter if she didn't explicitly say no, be a friend."
cf99h4,NTA how selfish of your mom to care more about showing off to others rather than respecting your wishes.

cf9g91,"NTA. I personally agree with you, but buckle up cause you're going to get yelled at for saying she's too young to decide. From the facts though, it sounds like she's deciding only because your sister told her its the only way to be happy, it has nothing to do with sexual feelings towards anyone."

cf9xzu,YWBTA - There's nothing that says you can't be friends. Just don't be a predator. You can be friends with a girl without making it weird. She's 16. She probably has no friends at the college. Ghosting her would be absolutely shitty of you.
cf9yza,NAH. I get where you are coming from but I would be remiss if I didn't remind ourselves we are talking about a 2013 Chevy Spark with major body work. Exactly what is the resell value we are trying to preserve?

cfaal0,"Bruh, YTA. You didn't ask her for 2 $5's, so she gave you the most sensible option which is one bill and one coin. Use your big boy words next time and ask the waitress for a pair of 5's rather than assuming it's a hustle, which it absolutely fucking wasn't."

Fifteen years flew by, or maybe they didn't, who knows, but suddenly he was dead. Describing the grief I felt is so hard because why did I feel so sad? He wasn't even a part of my life? I cried for months because it was final, my dad was gone and there was nothing I could say or do. When I had so *much* to say. 

I finally realized the grief was because I no longer had any hope of reconciling. I guess in those 15 years I thought he'd call me or I'd call him, but somewhere in my heart hope had been hiding, just waiting.

It's been 10 years since he passed and I still cry, as I am now, as I do every time I think about him because the regret just kills me. Please don't do what I've done. Even if you can't forgive him today, try to make small steps, your future self will thank you."

And brother is obviously the AH for his behavior and statements. Mental illness isn't an excuse to be a dick. He can't help it since he's never been corrected in a meaningful way, but it's still AH behavior.

Unfortunately, it's all about that timer (and it's generally pretty rude to ask for stuff at the food window- we'll get you whatever sauce you want if you ask over the speaker, but at the window we're just trying to get your food to you and move on and the bags have already been assembled, most mistakes happen when bags get confused due to last minute adds/changes)."
cfdn20,YTA.  Passive aggressive af bro.
cfdnvx,"YTA.

I've worked in food plenty and you *never* offer to give away food unless you A.) *are* the manager or B.) *instructed to* by a manager. This was above your paygrade."
cfdpvn,NTA.  Sometimes you just need mental health days to take a break.  And your team has to learn to survive without you.
cfdsyy,"NTA. It’s your special day, you’re celebrating your graduation! It doesn’t make sense to share it honestly, it’s 2 totally separate occasions. You need to tell your mom how you feel about it and tell her the reasons why."
cfdtkl,NTA. She’s grown and can feed herself but it seems like maybe she needs some kind of hobby or part time job to get out. All those questions are probably just her way of trying to socialize from being home all the time
cfdtrp,NTA. Your mom is expecting you to read her mind. She's dumb.
cfduhy,If you are coming at them with the same attitude as this post then absolutely without a doubt YTA. I get that a dog was annoying but that fact being able to negate feeling sympathy towards someone who lost a pet. Yikes.
cfdxze,"NAH. Everyone has their limit, and you’ve reached yours in this situation.  Be careful that you don’t become TA in how you talk to her about this.  I’m thinking that it’s got to be tough to hear this amount of unhappiness daily from someone you care about - that is one way to explain it.  She hurts, you hurt.  But that you are 100% supportive of her finding a new job, and that’s what you’d like to hear about."
cfe14u,NTA her driving sucks you said so yourself. It's better to be an asshole to her than pay 5 grand + and be a gentleman
cfe38i,"YTA. You should have just said ""I think he's still on break""."
cfe51m,NAH. 9 is too old to share dad’s bed now though. And you have a jealous girl to deal with. Good luck OP.
cfe5y8,"NTA she was a bridezilla , who doesn’t let the bridesmaids TRY on the dress. Super weird."
cfe66k,"NTA - you were ready to pay for your own food, not someone else's.  Sure, the guy ahead of you did something nice, but it doesn't make you TA for not continuing the chain."
cfe6wo,NTA just cause it’s a place for kids doesn’t mean they can jump all over people
cfe7ga,"YTA, its like me seeing a white character on a TV show and saying hey thats just like you. It is not a thing that needed to be commented on. While not racist, it is extremely rude."
cfeb4e,YWBTA. The coach has rules. If she does start talking behind your back or covertly bully you tell the coach. Don't go with the intent of making her not join the team. Payback has its limits. Saying mean things as a 12 year old while not nice isn't something you need to go after her for right now.
cfedj6,"NTA. Fucking $80, what a pack of bums they are."
cfef1s,NTA.  You gave her a heads up and kept your word.  You're good.  She's not entitled to your stuff.
cfeh0q,"YTA, you're jealous of a dead girl. 

It isn't up to you to decide whether or not your fiance sees himself as a ""victim"". Even from your pov, which I suspect is heavily biased, it doesn't sound like anything worse than typical couple spats (how is she an unhealthy person for being introverted? tf?).

Let him deal with his grief the way he wants to, and if you can't deal with that then you can always leave."
cfeipg,"NAH She loves you! I think giving her a list of things might turn her off completely or make her think twice about her generosity! Suggest going shopping with her next time, or going and doing something together! Making memories would be valuable as well!"
cfek9j,"NTA as a Veteran I can tell you, I loved getting to hear the other Soldiers in my unit get the Jodie call. Sure it sucked for my brother soldier for a while, but we usually had bets going on who would get the next Jodie call. Even if you didn't win, sure was fun to play."

cfeo66,"NAH.  I mean you should try to help her, if you think that telling your mother is the best course of action then go for it."
cfery1,[deleted]
cfeuru,I agree. This really crossed the line and was needlessly cruel She said she didn't know it and you even went to your manager. Not a good way to have good a coworker relationship. Everyone can learn. Yta
cfevi0,"Honestly fuck that friend, what a rude asshole. Let people enjoy shit as long as it isn’t harmful. NTA"
cfexdf,NTA. Have you talked to the man about your concerns? Maybe you could convince him to walk them separately if he can’t control them?
cfexsk,"NTA. Yes it's just a video game, and yes you were able to easily restore it, but it's the underlying intent behind his actions - *he* probably didn't know you could restore it easily, so he thought he was causing unfixable (without a lot of time and effort at least) damage out of spite for not getting his way. Banning him from your house entirely would be overkill, but banning him from unsupervised access to your games is reasonable and fitting."
cfez43,"NTA. I think anyone would panic. The real asshole here is the person who wasn’t monitoring a small child in the bathroom. If you bring a little kid in the bathroom with you and they can’t behave, they go in the stall with you."
cff2ze,"NTA 

Dam she needs therapy. Would you consider family therapy? How she’s treating you is so mean and coming from a place of hurt. Sorry OP that has to *suck*. 

Also, you sound like you’re doing really great. Enjoy Bali, it’s wonderful."
cff3dr,"ESH 

Your gf is making this more than it is but honestly, so are you. 

You aren’t comfortable with locker room talk.   That’s fine. There is nothing wrong with that. 

But you keep making it about sexual orientation and that’s what makes you the asshole in this situation."
cff4h9,NTA. It’s definitely reasonable in this situation to want paternity confirmed. Their reaction definitely doesn’t help in this situation. Push the issue.
cff65j,"NTA.  I would tell them that they should look forward to moving in with your brother every time they say ""no nursing homes""."
cff80t,"NTA Maybe a little distance from your sister will do you good. She sounds extremely self-centered. 

edit:You absolutely do not have to deal with it. She's 40, her point of changing for the better is long gone."
cff851,"NAH.  Honestly you should just get her something tiny, just so you gave her something.  It is what it is."
cffcxr,NTA. At all. That’s fucked up. Of course you won’t be at home as much; you’re 20 and have a GF. You shouldn’t be obligated to spend ALL of your time with your family. It’s even more fucked up that they kicked you out.
cffixz,"YTA. People change and grow apart, especially during uni years. Lan didn't put a gun to your friends head and make him change. He wanted to change, and YTA if you are happy about someone's life changing injury."
cffjr6,"NTA these people are insane. Shoes cost money. She CAN'T buy new shoes every week. The kid has a mountain of shoes at her dad's, she is only barefoot while her mom carries her. And sorry, shitty flip flops STILL COST MONEY. A young single mother WILL OFTEN BE POOR. It doesn't mean she is a bad parent, or can't take care of her child. She wouldn't have a problem if the father wasn't STEALING FROM HIS DAUGHTER to financially drain the mother. Geez. Oh, the child will notice that mOmMy Is FiGhItInG bAtTlEs WiTh HeR but she won't notice her own father stealing her shoes? Get out with that crap."
cfflys,NTA.  I would have punched the guy for touching/hurting my dog.
cffnhc,My grandma did. It was someone to hold hands with that made her happy. Why not?
cffnme,"YTA. Does it really matter? He isn't asking you to lie about anything serious. In the grand scheme of things, where you met isn't monumentally important. He's embarrassed and doesn't want his family to know that he was swiping through a dating app, just respect the guy's wishes and forget about the issue."
cffnmm,[deleted]
cffnq4,NTA at all. It sounds like you're doing what's best for your mental health in a way deliberately calibrated not to be hurtful to your mom.
cffocu,"NTA

She lied about not being able to get out of the house clearly because she got out of the house for something else. The fact that you ended your friendship over this means it was either on thin ice or not very strong so it’s probably better for the both of you."
cffonm,"NTA this sounds like you dodged a bullet. Let HR know in a way that won't burn your bridges, and feel free to warn other applicants on glassdoor."
cffppn,"NTA- but it would be a stupid move.  Wait until you have a good reputation before you make waves.  If it’s too much- find another gig.  You have to learn the ropes, including the culture of your new work place.  It sucks, but it’s a necessary evil of being lowest man on the totem pole."
cffqwj,"ESH

You suck a lot for not offering to take over the payments for the car you were using when your dad lost his job. The entitlement emanating from you is astounding - “I had better things to pay for” other than the car you were using for two years. You definitely owe him the $670. I can’t even believe you would hesitate to give him that. 

Dad sucks for adding the surprise $2500 bill at the end."
cffr3n,"NTA. This guy is rude and ignorant and he’s lucky that’s all you did. Some random dude I didn’t even know sent me a message on FB messenger once. Here’s how it went:

Scumbag: hi
Me: do I know you?
Scumbag: you once commented on an a comment I posted on (my hometown group’s page).   Sends me a screenshot of comment. It was more than two years ago. 
Me: oh?
Scumbag: sends a picture of his penis. Flaccid.   Not even erect. And somehow he had it “decorated” to look like a turkey. 

I took screenshots of the whole thing. Found out where he work. Sent them to his boss. Found out who his mother is. Sent them to her. THEN I blocked him. 

Don’t you dare feel bad for a second for blocking someone who treated you so poorly. You’re NTA x a zillion."
cffrhp,"YTA. If someone brings over a bottle of wine, whiskey, beer...whatever...its customary to open that bottle and share with company. The only exception is if so many people brought over things to drink that opening the bottle would just be a waste. In that case, save it for another occasion at your home when you invite the giver over again."
cffrks,"NTA, you're not Mike's mom or Uber driver. Mike doesn't get to govern when you go somewhere or how often you're allowed to go to the store, start saying no to these requests yesterday."
cffs1g,ESH. Her for being 100% uncompromising. You for wanting to be dishonest and lie to her about stuff. If she is anything like me she absolutely will notice and wake up. So good luck man.
cffte7,Totally NTA.  I don't play D&D but my awareness of it is that being the DM is a big responsibility and a thankless one sometimes too.  Eff that shit if they're being dicks.
cffu21,"NTA, and you can actually ask FB to remove it. Also, block her so she can’t tag you on anything else."
cffuf3,Info-  are you in a position to offer your dad the same deal?  He could retire and let you take over.
cffv42,"I wouldn't call you an asshole but if it makes him uncomfortable, I would stop. He doesn't seem to be rude about it?"
cffvzt,NTA! Relationships aren't competitions. Sounds like the co-worker is jealous of what you have.
cffxkc,"NTA

It was racist of her to give only you chopsticks, especially since according to you, you ordered steak and calamari which doesn’t even require chopsticks. Maybe it would make you an asshole for snapping at her but I would say it’s a justified asshole."
cffxl5,[deleted]
cffxzt,"NTA - he sounds like a bully, and your mom enables him. Is there somewhere else you can go?"
cfg3hw,NTA your house your rules. Not washing your hands after going to the bathroom is disgusting.
cfg41a," NTA. If they didn’t realize what their dogs were doing then yes, but they obviously know and aren’t doing anything about it. That’s absurd to me that they don’t keep their dogs on leashes. I’m guessing there’s an ordinance in the town/city to keep your dogs on leashes?"
cfg4zg,[deleted]
cfg65f,"YTA and here's why I think so.

No harm no foul if you had just picked to the phone and said, ""sorry hon, I fell asleep and I'm so tired. Can we talk tomorrow? I love you.""

If she then gets super pissed about you being tired, then I think you're well within your rights to ignore her while you sleep.

But you didn't. You ignored her. No chance for communication. That makes YTA"
cfg77u,"NTA. It sounds like you were polite yet firm. Nothing wrong with that. You should have gotten a manager on the phone the first time and not had to jump through these hoops. And they absolutely should have honored what they told you, mistake or not. They’re employees acting on the restaurant’s behalf so if they give out wrong information they should be honoring it and using that as a training piece."
cfg7bu,"NTA, that’s disgusting"
cfg7ix,NTA. You’re young and it sounds like you just want you’re mom back.
cfg7mg,NAH addiction is hard to beat.
cfgblb,NTA. Your mom is a bully and is gaslighting you. She has no boundaries and has not respected your clearly stated wishes on numerous occasions. Good for you for not allowing her to cross another boundary with you. I would limit your time and exposure to her and continue to reinforce your boundaries when she tries to push you.
cfgbn2,"What? Of course not! I'm just saying, Pepsi Max is a great soda! It has the great Pepsi taste with 0 sugar! 0 sugar = 0 calories. Refreshing and delicious. Make sure you buy your Pepsi Max today!"
cfgf4i,"ESH you have no right to take control of the child and kick the mother out. She is her daughter and if she doesn’t want you disciplining then that’s her choice.

Your choice is if you want children with somebody who doesn’t believe in discipline. You’re laying all the blame on the father who isn’t around, but both her parents suck. Your hearts in the right place, but using financial means to control anybody is ultimate dick move."
cfggse,NTA. It sounds like she doesn't really have the funds to properly care for a snake. Would she even have housing for it or was she just planning on letting it roam around her room?
cfgj8z,NTA. If she insists on housework equality tell her you insist on expenses equality.
cfgn6y,"NTA It sounds like you both have been through a lot and it’s understandable why you would be upset with your brother. He had his reasons for acting the way he did, and you have your reasons for not forgiving him. I don’t think that makes you an AH."
cfgncc,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Sorry, that's not an answer. But this type of story is 100% how idiots think they can justify their ridiculous and clearly WRONG viewpoints.

""You say that vaccines aren't bad, but my friend's daughter got vaccinated and 4 decades later she died in a blimp explosion. Explain THAT Mr Scientist. With all you logic.""


Sorry, still not helping.

NTA - Your friend is an idiot."
cfgz0v,"NAH. She feels one-upped because you were able to give him something she couldn't. In saying she wasn't gonna get him the guitar, she probably thought she was dropping a hint that you'd pick up. You didn't realize that and were just trying to do something nice for your nephew. Y'all just need to communicate better!"
cfgzmg,"NTA 

What I do in these kinds of situations is smile at the parent and say something like ""they're fine - I'm adoring the excitment!""

Mom is prob just paranoid she's gonna get her ass handed to her for not ""controlling her child"" - I try to let parents know that kids will be kids and I got their back."
cfh3v8,"NTA

He is scamming people and will keep doing so until it becomes a problem for him"
cfh72a,"Yta. If part of the reason you want to go is just to see your ex uncomfortable, don’t go. You’re turning someone else’s wedding into a way to screw with someone. Not the time or place. Let it go."
cfhbqk,"NTA- for worrying about your friends well being. I would recommend getting him somewhere where they can check him out mentally. He might be in a bad place right now and everybody has their demons, but straight thinking people know that running from police/probation/etc is only going to result in more time behind bars."
cfhc3c,"YTA. There come a point where there is playing and winning vs winning and alienating your friends. Do it a time or two, you've proven your point, get over yourself and back off."
cfhchc,NTA. They need to grow up and pay their own way.
cfhhuj,"Absolutely NTA.

Your parents are guilt tripping and gaslighting you. You don’t have any obligations towards your brother now that you’re independent. 

Get out of there as soon as you can."
cfhhv4,NTA! I come from a mixed family too. My mom is white and dad as thai. My grandma on my dads side always had a problem with my mom partly because she was white. Growing and seeing them fight all the time wasnt something any kid should witness.
cfhrsj,"...yes, when you hurt someone that person may hold it against you for a long time to come. We're talking about a high schooler - lying, cheating and verbally abusing an SO is actually something I'd expect a teenager to know is bad."
cfhs23,"NTA.  There's nothing more frustrating than someone dumping their negativity on you, when the solution is clear as day and easily fixed.  You gave her a reality check and she didn't like it, simple as that."
cfhudg,"NTA
She doesn’t drink why would you invite her.
I would just not invite her and if she calls you on it. Just be like “oh last time we went you told me you didn’t drink so I didn’t think you be interested” and then exit stage left."
cfhwm0,"NTA. I don't understand why you care about a pepper and not the sexual harrassment.

Side note: unless it directly relates to the story, there is no need to tell us she is black. Assholes come in every color."
cfhyzi,"NTA. It’s a bunch of coworkers hanging out , it would be weird to invite her even if she didn’t have a thing for your coworker"
cfi09m,"YTA hear me out - this is not the way to behave in any working environment - the yelling and the cussing. 

And your manager needs to be on top of this. Have you explained you just decided yourself to stop selling salads or that you were told you couldn’t sell any more fries? If you are unable to do your job properly (not saying it’s your fault) you need to tell your manager. 

If customers need to wait it’s not for you to decide that they shouldn’t. You put on your customer service voice and explain that there would be a wait, are they happy waiting 10 mins or however long it takes."
cfi0it,"YTA - what is wrong with you??

You can’t just remove people’s doors and throw them away!  WTF, dude?  You need therapy, seriously"
cfi5a7,NTA but holy shit it’s a minuscule amount to be pissed over.
cfi7ts,"YWBTA if you went her to boss and told her personal issues you have with your mother.

Therapists make the worst parents. I know. It’s like you need to go to therapy with her to sort out your own issues. 

What she’s doing is fucked but you’d be overstepping trying to ruin her career coz she’s a shitty mother. Doesn’t mean she’s a terrible therapist to her patients."
cfia6f,"YTA

Do some research because you sound ignorant. It sounds to me like she copes pretty well and was able to finish college and keeps a job. You haven't even entered the real world and have the privilege of not suffering from what she is. Grow up."
cfiawa,"YTA You view this as ""art"" and I support you in that. But a coworker at work doodling on post-it notes just...isn't gonna trigger a sense of ""owning the originals"". Since you're the one with concerns you needed to raise them or be clear early on. Especially with leaving them at his desk - that's a gift! That's not ""leaving them for him to see"", no one would take it that way without clarification. 

Basically, you failed to communicate, failed to read the room, and then failed to own that failure. Make some copies, you keep the copies, and you learn a lesson about life. You did give them away by any meaningful standard."
cficb2,"ESH, you’re all assholes for letting this girl mess with your friendships like this and fighting w each other about it and she’s an asshole for doing it. Bros before hoes especially when said hoe is soon to be gone."
cficwx,"NAH - you're at a tough age. You know how much your parents have failed you, but you don't have the life experience to have empathy for what they've gone through to explain why they've sucked so bad. Hang in there. The more you establish yourself as an adult, the more you are going to know if they made normal mistakes, or horrible ones."
cfigof,"NTA. She seems very Karen-esque. Live your life. BTW, your food sounds delicious!!"
cfih1v,"NTA. I don’t think my eyes can roll any further back in my head right now. The adult response to you not being able to take time off work because you don’t check Facebook often (I do but never see the invites for whatever reason) would be: “Oh, I am so sorry that you didn’t see it. That stinks you won’t be able to make it, but I understand that it’s super short notice. Next year I’ll text you directly! You’ll definitely be missed!” This garbage about how the kid is upset and whatnot is either him projecting his own feelings into his kid or because your friend made a big deal of it to his child. Kids react to the way things are told to them. If I toddler falls over and the adults acknowledge it with a “wow! Check out that cool move you just did” or a “nice save” or even applause the child smiles and moves on. The parents who coddle and freak out “oh my baaaaaaby are you hurt?!” have kids who freak out. 

If he went to his child and said that you forgot his birthday and decided work was more important than being around him, of course he’ll be upset. Meanwhile, all your friend had to do is explain it to his child in a matter of fact, no big deal tone and that would be the end of it. “Hey, kid. Uncle ______ has to work the day of your party, but he said to wish you a happy birthday and sends a hug. “  Done. 

Your friend needs to get over it and realize that this isn’t the end of the world. (He might also want to get out a bit more if he can. It sounds like he needs adult interaction. )"
cfii4u,"NTA - I would say you are only obligated to pay for the drink of the friend who paid for yours. If you don't want to have to pay for people's drinks, don't let them pay for yours."
cfiioq,"YTA- I don’t know your situation well enough to understand the aspects of it but I understand why she would be uneasy with the situation. 
It sounds like you have good intentions with helping them have a little bit of credit when they are older to be able to borrow money. However you would also be putting them on the hook for something they have no control over. They could become liable for any debt you incur on said credit card and your mother is likely trying to protect them from getting into a situation that they don’t understand all of the risks too."
cfilh7,nta. it sounds awful and u will be doing others a favor by dropping the name (instead of the full name u could say Dr. ____)
cfilvv,"NTA, It sounds like you were ambivalent about the whole process and tried to make the people with strong ties happy.  That is understandable since you are not close with your parents.  I think they were so offended because they had an image of what a grieving daughter should be like and you did not fit that description. I have a feeling that if you came and cried and fought them on things they would have tried to throw in your face how you never visited."
cfin86,"YTA. You knew the child wasnt in danger and deliberately mislead the police, wasting their time.

Noise complaints go through the council or environmental health unless its outside hours. Most councils recommend a polite conversation with your neighbours before starting the complaints process. 

The neighbours might be arseholes but there are ""invisible"" conditions that could cause that type of behaviour which would not be the fault of the parents."
cfiqw3,"Definitely NTA, or making a big deal out of nothing.

Sounds like she's *always* going to blow off criticism from you as you being ""a teenager"" and just being ridiculous, though.

I'd move out before pushing the matter, personally. And even then, there might not be any point. Leopards don't generally change their spots that late in life."
cfirxf,"NTA - you have every right to be upset at this seller for confirming a sale and scheming behind your back and ultimately screwing you over. Hope that dude steps on a Lego, and hope you find a good sale soon!!"
cfisuy,NTA they probably didn’t choose her because she’s clearly obsessed with it.
cfitv6,"Worst idea i've heard all day.

cfivz2,"ESH and you know why. Every adult has to make their own way in the world, no exceptions. It's completely entitled to think you're the only one living in a shared space who doesn't have to pay. 

That being said, I understand where you were, and how hard to is to get on your feet. I'm glad you're doing better now, and I hope you see how selfish you were being. 

Your friend should have been straight forward, and not passive aggressive. He reacted to the situation horribly."
cfj180,"YTA. Going straight to GET AWAY FROM MY FRIEND WHO JUST FAINTED OR I'LL CALL THE COPS without explaining a little is a little murky, but you being mad at your friend, who lives with this, being okay with it, then it just kind of seems like you're mad that your ""authority"" on your friend passing out was questioned. Chill, dude"
cfj2ex,"NTA- you offered to host him and he was extremely disrespectful to you even though you were nice enough to give him somewhere to stay, he shouldn’t have been an asshole"

cfjae6,"NTA. The argument sounds petty, and surely two adults could have worked this out. Who throws away a decades long relationship over one trivial argument? 

That said, it sounds like your brother has become overly burdensome in his requests and acted out quite viciously writing to your employer. You chose to sever your business arrangement using a clause in a contract he drafted himself - totally kosher move. Your brother didn't lose value, he just didn't gain additional interest. Plus your care of the home and dealing with renters is a free value gained by your brother, at the cost of your time. Your brother still came out well ahead.

Edit: your brother upset he didn't get to soak you for interest is beyond the pale."
cfjakg,YTA you're being a sugar daddy to your 3rd world girlfriend and making her look out to be a clown. I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation. If she finds out about this the relationship is OVER. You dug your own grave TS. and you told one of your female friends? lose lips sink ships
cfjaos,"NTA but honestly, stop doing this at all.  Lending money between friends is rarely a good idea. Even if they intend to and do pay you back, it puts a slant on the relationship when one person is always owed something. I know you are just helping people out but I really think that adding debt to any friendship is a bad idea."
cfjcvz,"NTA but as a fellow bipolar patient, I’d advise you to write the letters, but not send them yet. Pregnancy - and the period after - can be one of the most difficult periods for bipolar women. A huge trigger for both mania and depression. You might want to make sure that you don’t do something now, that you might feel differently about later. So I’d write it now, but wouldn’t send immediately."

It only obligated you to pay them back."
cfkupi,NTA - so does she think the janitor deserves a tip too bc he keeps the floors clean around the machine amd it is a sucky job? Her job had nothing to do with the winnings that other person got.
cfkwdp,"Oh hell no.  You’re NTA.  They’re directly impacting your livelihood.  You are priority #1, not your neighbors."
cfkypr,"NTA

They should replace what they stole with the same thing; if I broke your iPhone XS and offered to replace it with an iPhone 4 that would hardly be kosher would it?

I think getting them to admit to your parents that they stole it is probably overkill, unless your parents notice the missing bottles before they are replaced, in which case an explanation would be necessary."
cfkzgh,"You should probably have a separate family and friends account. That would probably sort this out. He probably feels that you are somehow ashamed of him and are excluding him. He should also be more appreciative of your generosity. NTA

Edit :typo"
cfkzo4,"NTA at all. Unfortunately some people are just born idiots (your GC, not the baby) and anything you sent for the child will ultimately end up being spent by her instead. The parents hardly seem the type to support a college education for their child. You aren't taking anything from the baby because it would never receive it in the first place."
cfl0x4,"NTA and you Dont sounds like a brat at all. Tell them if they’re tired and uncomfortable that they can go home, you’ll be alright on your own. If you don’t want to offend them, make it sound like it’s for their own benefit. 

You’ve got a lot of responsibility on your shoulders and should set some boundaries where you can. As a carer it can be easy to put the needs of others before your own, but you need to look after you aswell. 

Get them home, and get the help you need!"
cfl14y,NTA. People shouldn't put you in this position. They owe you money so make them pay it back.
cfl2z3,"ESH. Obviously chick is a bitch. Your friend is an idiot though, she keeps putting herself in this person's life, so she's going to keep getting burned. You should just back out of the entire situation, your friend wants to be friends with this person, if she didn't, then she wouldn't keep going back. Just stay out of it, and let your friend make her own mistakes."
cfl7ow,"NAH

Time to go full Karen on this mf."
cflb12,"NTA 

Sometimes people need to be “snapped” at. 

You showed far more patience in that situation than I would have. 

He was a guest, at “your” party that “you” threw and organised and were nice enough to invite him to, and he spent it being anti social, selfish and callous. 

My advice is don’t invite him to future functions and use this as a case in point as to why. 

Then Perhaps he’ll learn to be a better friend."
cfllwa,"I don't feel like I can adequately judge this...NAH, maybe?  Aside from the abusive, asshole boyfriend, of course.

Everyone thinks it's really easy to leave an abusive partner. Abuse typically starts off rather insidiously - some subtle manipulation, gaslighting, etc and escalates rapidly from there. Abusers know how to lock it in and really wreck their victim's mental state, making leaving harder than it looks to anyone outside of the relationship. It can take a LOT to break those strings.

I'm of the opinion that you should go. Not because you should bow out on your feelings, but to show her that you will always be in her corner. If you start bailing on things, I'm afraid she may think you've left her behind and when she finally decides to break free, she'll need every friend she can get.

I don't blame you at ALL for not wanting to be around this guy, though. He sounds like an absolute shit stain of a human."
cflpeb,"friend or so - if I want to share the changing room with someone, I alsways specifically offer it - it is never implied.
from what you describe he was also not trying on anything himself? so why not just wait like a normal person for you to come out??

NTA"
cflqdm,"NTA

I certainly would have liked to know about that if it were me in Landon's spot"
cfls1o,"NTA  


First of all - why the hell would she offer your house before even asking you?  
I get it - their situation is horrible, but as cold as that may sound - it is not your concern.   
You have more than a few valid reasons why you do not want them living in your house."
cflt2y,"100% NTA. It is your choice to come out, and that includes when and how you choose to do it. Your mother sounds like the asshole in this situation if she can’t accept who you are and love you unconditionally. Sending hugs your way, OP."
cflume,NTA. It’s a weird subculture they develop and they definitely don’t like being told they’re wrong - say tread they carefully. If you play it right you’ll maintain your friendship and also set the boundary that he shouldn’t ask your to sign up for his scheme . Also don’t reveal any kind of financial insecurity in your life because he’ll pounce on that as an opportunity to start pitching his crap.
cflvzp,"YTA for not checking with your husband first. Not that you need his permission, but it’s both your house and you took away even the illusion of being a partnership. Seems like he would have agreed anyway even if it did make him uncomfortable. You knew it made him uncomfortable and then made the decision regardless."
cflxis,"YTA - I mean what's the big deal? She saw an opportunity to give you back more than you gave her, and took it. You'll need that currency anyway. I don't see the problem here"
cflym4,"NTA. Why would anyone expect you to stay in a situation that makes you feel unloved and/or unsupported?

Maybe you should talk it out before leaving, though."
cflzcf,NTA.  You were a touch blunt but no more blunt than she was being.  Why she would announce that she wasn't going to sleep with you when you weren't even hitting on her is anyone's guess but it was really presumptuous on her part.
cfm0bu,"NTA. Your dad was not supposed to have that there. He was in the wrong and most likely knows it. If your father is willing to do this to you, for doing the right thing rather than accepting his fault, then it’s his loss, but I am so sorry you're going through this."
cfm3k3,"I get where you're coming from, but YTA. I get why you'd be extra sensitive to comments about death right now, but it's very common for people to be dramatic and say that something is going to kill them when that thing is unpleasant but survivable. It's understandable if you don't want people to make those jokes around you, but you have to *tell* people that. R didn't say they were dying and then stop responding for a bit to scare you, they just thought it was obvious that they were joking and didn't realize how badly it would affect you.

Edit: to be clear, I think R was being a bit insensitive, but I don't think they deserved a tongue lashing."
cfm3p3,NTA white bread is terrible for ducks and big pieces will choke them. If the dad doesn’t know/doesn’t care then at least give the kid a chance to know.
cfm47g,NAH but a Facebook post announcing it would be super obnoxious.
cfmaro,"Technically, NAH. But it **is** a bit weird and many girls would get a little creeped out by it. Is it really that important that you use *her* nudes? Over 7 billion people in the world and you just *have* to spank it to her? Can't use any of the endless sea of porn that already exists of other people?

I guess it's one of those ""risk vs reward"" situations. Is the ""reward"" of touching yourself to her really worth the ""risk"" of her thinking you're a creep? It's insanely easy to get people on the hate-train against men who do something slightly creepy on the internet. You really sure her nudes are worth that risk?

Edit to add; other comments need to stop with the N T A. That would mean she's being an asshole, and all she's done is put some nudes online lol"
cfmb81,"NTA.

They were headed towards a very petty argument and would've tried roping you in somehow."
cfmdns,"YTA

>I’m of the opinion that my daughter should wait until her actual birthday to open them

Then you should have her party on or after her actual birthday, so you don't feel the urge to be an asshole to a 5 year old about opening her presents a week early."
cfmhee,"NTA

You're trying to make things work.

Have you considered getting him one of those vibrating wrist alarms? Not certain how well they work on deep sleepers, but it would (hopefully) disturb you less.

Alternatively, his alarm goes off, you throw a glass of water on his face. That should wake him up good and proper."
cfmjsn,"NAH 

You could kick start their savings by moving out."
cfmo4t,NTA but I think you could ask in r/legaladvice
cfmom4,NTA. You can lead a horse to water but you can't stop it eating pizza
cfmpor,You should maybe check legal advice for this.. I don’t feel like he can not pay you the agreed price.
cfmq0z,"What? Yes of course YTA. 7-day-old refrigerated cake is not going to make you sick. It was harmless ribbing, if it hurt your feelings just mention to them that you're not a fan of that kind of joking, but escalating it up the chain would be such an overreaction."

cfmxnn,"NTA

According to you it’s illegal. There’s laws for a reason and you shouldn’t be reprimanded for calling out someone breaking them, no matter how petty it seems."
cfn0x1,"NAH. Your parents probably asked your grandpa to look in on you. Recognize that he is doing a kind thing, and be grateful. Can you spend meal times with him but have the rest of your evening to yourself? He should understand if you tell him you're studying for finals. You don't need to explain further."
cfn6r4,"ESH. John is gross for watching porn in school (ew? but I digress). You shouldn’t have done that, though. Apologize and maybe cool it with the pranks."

cfndv3,"NTA it's your character, not theirs, so you get the say what happens to them"
cfne1b,"NTA... as a mom of toddlers, they tend to throw fits over everything, her mother should know this and not demand that you give in to her.

You are right to keep something that’s special to you out of the hands of a two year old!"
cfngly,I was going to say no assholes here but definitely NTA because he wouldn’t stop. Can he not read a room? Also your mom is being unfair to you. It’s not banter if the person being teased isn’t laughing.
cfni9e,"NTA.   12 years old is not too young to be aware of the existence of atheists.  Plus, she asked you point blank, it’s not as if you brought it up."

cfnkb1,YTA for the reason you feel like TA. Should’ve just been honest from the beginning. True friends will understand.
cfnnzd,"YTA and so is your husband.

Of course dilbert  is going to go with his fiancee to her grandfather's birthday party. He was a bit naive to think otherwise. Why the two of you are so upset over this makes no sense to me."

cfnpuz,[deleted]
cfnqhe,"ESH

She sucks because she doesn't own this field, she hasn't officially reserved it or even part of it, so her yelling at other people using this field is a jerk move.

Unless this is specifically a park where dogs are allowed to be off-leash, you also suck for not leashing your dog in general, and for not leashing him after a specific request to leash him (you chose this in retaliation). If you're having a hard time with her, **you** could also move to a different field."
cfnqyw,Your entire family just seems like dicks
cfnr5i,"NTA

The fact that it could have been a serious medical emergency and she still ignored you because she was “uncomfortable” is absurd. She’s a doctor for God’s sake. There’s nothing weird about it."
cfntp4,"NTA

One guest per resident is the rule and they have to follow it. It seems they are being very inconsiderate for the people actually living there that want to get in the pool."
cfnvlu,Well if you've emailed them just wait for their reply? You can't exactly keep it if they ask for it back because you've made them aware of it
cfny2e,YTA because you don't actually know.  So catch them in the act and then confront them again.
cfny7x,"NTA

It was very inconsiderate of them to part it right in front of your house and the fact that they didn’t move it after two months says they don’t intend on moving it. So you have the right to call HOA"
cfnyzi,"WTF, your friend was being creepy (whether you minded or not, his behavior was fucked up), and somehow you're the jerk for violating his privacy? That's what showers are for, ffs.

NTA. You should definitely not APOLOGIZE for being aware that your male friend decided to rub one out next to you in bed. Yuck."

cfo32k,"NTA,  it's your choice"
cfo6nt,"YTA. But I'm a huge animal lover (therefore I feel biased) and wouldn't ever rehome any of my pets. Also cats are easily stressed and it will be a huge adjustment for him/her.

Has she ever been willing to confront her fear with a therapist so that you don't have to get rid of a beloved pet? Because you're the only one making a sacrifice here, at the expense of a living animal."

cfoa8m,"NTA.  Justified, you should not give him your work, because then it could come back to bite you in the future."

cfoijt,"YTA. There is no reason to lie. Just say that all families are different: some families have two mommies, some have two daddies, some have one mommy, some have one daddy, etc, etc. They're kids. They're resilient. They won't miss what they never had."
cfokxg,"NTA tell them now.  Weed is one thing but snorting percocet, good grief that's pretty next-level.  That's like an express train to dependence."

cfoz7a,"YTA. Your dad doesn’t owe you his support into your young adulthood , I’m sorry. He gave you a huge grace period and offered you a place to live, regardless. Being an adult is sometimes figuring things out on your own and being a parent is sometimes letting your kids fail so they can learn."

You didn't ask for it, won't use it, and wouldn't of bought it.

The nicest thing to do here would be to ask for the receipt and offer to take it back and then give her the money for it."

cfp9ek,"What? YTA - why are you letting other people invite themselves to your wedding? You pick a number of people, make a guest list and send out invitations.  If you didn’t have addresses for every family member you wanted to invite you ask them. But you’ve done this all wrong and let other people invite themselves or others as if you had unlimited space.  You had to cap the guests from the beginning and absolutely do not send anyone not invited an invitation with a sorry note, they don’t get invitations because they’re not invited."

cfpcgy,This person ain’t your friend.
cfpeoq,"NTA. She didn't ask, and you offered to do anything you could to help, thus giving her the opportunity to do so. Frankly, I think given the fact that your relationship was in a bad place at the time offering to come might well have been presumptuous. You did nothing wrong here."
cfpgr3,"NTA. It’s your parents job to support their kids, not yours. I think it’s commendable what you’ve offered your sister and you should not do any more for your siblings than is comfortable for you, especially if it feels like a poor investment"

They do not care about you."
cfpl2k,"ESH, he should have given it back when you asked and if you really wanted it back you should have insisted. You can't make him pay for a watch that is now a couple years old when that wasn't your original agreement."
cfpo3d,"NTA and this is something to discuss in therapy. It's very normal to crave a relationship with a parent, but what I've learned through therapy having had a similar experience with my father is that what I'm really craving is for him to *have loved me* the way a parent is supposed to. Realizing that will never happen has been both extremely painful and strangely liberating. He also wanted to ""make things right"" and it was just more excuses, self-pity, and ultimately disappointment.

I think the best thing would be to tell him that you need time to think about whether you want to talk. That gives you the chance to go to therapy, lay out the situation, and discuss what you want to do in a safe place. It could be that you decide to hear him out, it could be that you decide it won't be helpful. Whatever you decide, know that your mental health takes priority. Your father failed you and it is a privilege, not a right, for you to give him a chance to be in your life again."

cfreyz,"YTA, but for a slightly different reason in addition to what others have said, I think.

As you attest, your son attempts out of politeness to pretend he likes gifts and is excited about them, even when he is not. 

As you also attest, your son has Asperger's, and so, despite his efforts, you see through the front and know when he doesn't like a gift. 

Putting on the front, depending on how prominent your son's syndrome is, might be quite a large effort on his part, and acknowledging that you know the difference is a public acknowledgement that his effort has failed."

cfrr5p,NTA. I’ve had friends who have hung out with me completely fucked up. It’s not fun having to babysit while you’re sober.
cfrsgn,NTA - if they believe you paying for your own dinner is emasculating that's their problem. Don't change your values for some insecure men.

cfrtfv,NTA. Do what you need to do to feel safe in your community as long as it doesn’t actively bring harm on anyone else (and it seems like it doesn’t here).
cfrv5j,NTA.  Really a scummy thing to do.  Can't you talk to his girlfriend to tell him not to do it?
cfrzn3,"NTA for asking but don't get your hopes up. Training new employees is part of the job for the vast majority of workers, and you're not entitled extra compensation for doing so."

Black guy proceeded to call him racist as he recorded the conversation.  There is no winning in these situations.

cfsssa,"ESH. First of all...just break up with this person. He’s an asshole whether he gets a vasectomy or not. But demanding he do something he doesn’t want to do with his body in exchange for you doing so just makes no sense. Make the choice that works for you, with the full knowledge that your child will either have an absent father or an asshole one...which is not the worst thing in the world."
cfsu9q,"I think there’s a time and place for giving that type of advice. You might be right, and she may be overreacting, but sometimes it’s better to sacrifice being right to give someone an outlet they need to vent frustrations. It sounds like you’re a trusted/good friend that she would be calling you to complain in the first place. It sounds to me like she just needs to get some things off her chest from time to time — everyone copes with daily stresses in different ways.

Be supportive and try to get along for his sake.

cft6mj,NTA - ditch the toxic psycho
cft8wh,"Honestly YTA. It sounds like she’s given you plenty of free cupcakes, and when you finally decide to buy from her, you try to shortchange her by less than half. To make matters worse, you decide to go to her direct competition (that’s already pricey as well). 

I feel like if your husband is right an you can easily afford it, it would’ve been the *friendly* think to do to actually compensate her for her livelihood besides continuously expecting handouts. And saying she was throwing a “tantrum” to call you out on your entitled attitude is a shitty thing to do."

cftggl,"NAH- its developmentally appropriate for 3/4th graders to tell horrible, not funny jokes. That’s the age we figure out subtle humor and not just slapstick. You were fine. She should have laughed and said.... “next person stole the cookie too,” And it would have kept moving."

Because the travel agent did inform your husband- granted late, but still, I wonder if they knew the only reason you wanted to go was to bathe the elephants? Many people would love the tour anyway, and with tours it tends to be a “This is a general outline, nothing is guaranteed” sort of situation, as circumstances can change rapidly. Like getting rained out, or going to see something like the northern lights and having it be cloudy so you can’t see them, or going to a zoo to see a particular animal and it’s hiding at the time. Nothing is guaranteed. You can express to the travel agent “You might want to update your files because they no longer do bathing the elephants”, but complaining about it just makes you a complete Karen and the kind of A that everyone in tourism bitches about."

Rather than getting mad about him working at all, you should have worked together to plan chunks of time for him to get a little work done without missing important vacation moments.

It would have been better if he had communicated with you before he vacation that he would need to do a bit of work each day, but again because it was only an hour, that’s not a big enough flub to push him into the asshole category for me."
cfz409,"NAH. You can push once to see if there’s a date that works for everyone but it’s possible most people prefer this date for one reason or another, and you would be TA if you made a big deal about moving it, especially since they’re cashing you out."
cfz499,"If you lie and say you can’t afford it, you would be TA. But if you just called and saw if they could lower it for you / negotiated, that’s fine

While it may be unfair that you have to pay a bit more since you’re able, in my mind, it would be *more* unfair for a poor person to be refused necessary treatment because they can’t pay. If there’s a chance you getting a deal will mean a poor person cant, then it’s not worth it

I see this as the equivalent of a poor kid getting more financial aid than a rich kid. It’s “not fair” that the rich kid’s family has to spend more, but the other family literally doesn’t have the money to spend."

They don't have the parent-child relationship that you have but there really hasn't been anything unhealthy or even really a single red flag in this post. The only things that come close to red flags are coming from how you're working things that actually seem very normal.

As for what your sister would do if she got married; Changing up the living situation will be an option down the road. It's not like she's signing contracts keeping her in this for the rest of her life. You're acting like she has to make the choice now and stay in it for the rest of eternity.

Just... stop being so judgmental. It's a little weird to more independent people like us, but it's not weird enough to warrant you shoving your nose in their business. You've already made it clear to them that you have some concerns, now you need to back off and let them live their lives. They're adults who get to make their own choices."

TL;DR: You and your wife have some serious communication issues that need resolving, but by your own admission you were responsible for the initial breakdown of trust. You didn't ask what she wanted or how best you could support her, you kinda just decided you knew what was best.

Woof. There's a lot of reading-between-the-lines to do here because you really haven't given us enough information. Based on what we do have:

* **You aren't listening to your wife.** You said she had a plan for the basement. What was it? Why doesn't it count? We heard absolutely nothing about what *she* wanted to do. To me, this suggests that this may not be the only example of you not listening to her or paying attention to what she needs, particularly since...
* **Your history of problems clearly have not healed.** She still doesn't trust you after five months of sobriety. Your alcoholism may not have been the only problem that needed addressing. And may still need addressing.
* **Your version of ""trying to be supportive"" is actually imposing your preferences on her.** You didn't tell us a single thing about what she wanted. What you did, apparently, was to take it upon yourself to decide what was best for the basement and for *her parents.* Heck, look at the title of this post: ""I told my wife how I wanted to configure our basement."" Not ""I made suggestions"" or ""I sat down with my wife and showed her my ideas."" My guess is that she freaked out because you basically unilaterally decided how it was going to go, and I would be surprised if this was the first time.

I will say this: if your wife doesn't trust you, I'm not sure what's going on in this marriage, but five months may simply not have been enough time for things to heal, and based on your apparent instinct to decide that you know what's best, I'm thinking you aren't really aware of what you still need to fix about your own behaviour in order to rebuild the bridges in your family."

I'm going to go with ESH. My reason is, you seem to be an adult now and your sibling is a child. I feel like you have some contempt for your sibling but you need to realize it's your parents fault for fostering this kind of behavior.

What your sibling needs is a talk. A stern AND genuine talk. Don't write him off as selfish and then spite him. This won't help him grow into a mature and humble adult.

Maybe take a trip into the city and ride the bus with him. Volunteer for a soup kitchen with him. Lead him and be the role model that he can emulate. It's possible that years of struggle have made your parents complacent now that they're well off. Try your best to be a third parent. With the age gap, that's your role here."

However, if you have any other reason (like the fact that she is snarky about your education, and this is kinda retribution for that) then you’re being an a-hole. Now, it’s entirely possible that you feel this snobbishness about schools makes her a bad fit. That’s different. Also, it’s different if you go approach someone about this. But if you’re asked and you say positive things when you think she’s a bad fit, and she’s hired and she IS indeed a bad fit, then that reflects upon your judgment and ability to evaluate others and could possibly impact you and what your coworkers and managers think about you.

It doesn't matter why he was driving, he was being reckless and damaged his car.  If he was emotionally wracked from concern, he shouldn't have been driving in the first place.  I think he's upset that he feels like he wasted his time on a fools errand, and damaged a very expensive essential in the process.

This is a simple lack of communication between the two of you. You consider it important that others ask you before helping themselves to your food. Your roommate likely doesn't share that view, so they don't see it as a problem.

In terms of the actual food, that's a non-issue at this point since it's been replaced. I would, however, advise that you have a discussion with your roommate about food so this doesn't happen in the future."

Do you want to hear about what daughter and mom did together that day? Any cute things, any firsts? Cos the post reads like you want to be one on one with your daughter.

You made a human together. Spend time with her together. Your wife is going through a gruelling, draining time where she cannot catch up on sleep, ever, cos the baby will only rest on short cycles. I'm glad you're looking for advice on this now not further down the line. Imagine if you'd needed stitches in your torn butthole, had breasts heavy and aching and leaky every time the baby shrieks. Her body has been completely savaged by producing a child and when you get home, her love, her partner... you suggest she go and do chores.

Keep the maid. Sacrifice something else. If you earn enough to let her stay home, I'm sure you can budget for a bit of help. Newborns are BRUTAL. Infants are so demanding. Please support her and allow her to spend time with you both and focus on parenting as a team, not a tag team."
