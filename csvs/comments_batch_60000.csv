ckcpd1,"NAH - you love them and they love you.

But if it is giving you so much anxiety that you are crying at the thought of it, you may need to see a therapist for that anxiety. But first and foremost you need to take care of YOU and get the mental and physical rest you obviously need away from everybody for a while.

Edit: changed from n.t.a. to nah, and added some words."
ckcq4e,"It comes across as though you aren't serious about your relationship.  You've been together a year, and she has mentioned it that she'd like you to meet.  It's past time to be meeting them, and you should make an effort.  Your excuses are ""I spent my money on a new car, and I want to spend my birthday with my buddies"" ? and the language?  How have you been together a year and not at least made an effort to learn some of her language.  

I would say.... NAH...because of the work situation...If your work situation was more comfortable to have the time off I would say YTA with your other excuses.  But it's edgy, and gives off a vibe of not caring and thinking you're serious."
ckcq99,"You're now NTA, no one expects a tip for something like this so even if giving them a tip would have been nice you're not an asshole for not doing it, your sincere thanks and appreciation was enough.

Speaking of which, thanks for fixing the post. I'm not gonna give you a tip for it though.

Previous pre-edit Comment:

> YTA for whatever you did to the formatting of this post and making me have to read it like this."

ckcy3q,"NAH - this is tough but you're really thoughtful and a good child. She will understand hopefully, she's not doing anything wrong either."
ckcz9r,The only assholes in your story are the guy with raging pink eye and your ignorant manager. You are definitely NTA.
ckd102,"He needs to move out. Yesterday. He's a sponge. 

Wait. I forgot this is Reddit. Announce you are pregnant and you have no idea how it happened."
ckd1f6,NTA- if the roles were switched you’d be getting shit on
ckd1hu,NTA. Your parents should have done their research before spending their money. You tried what you could to put it to good use.
ckd1i0,"NTA

Pretty hypocritical for her to say she's progressive and yet use gay in a demeaning way. I understand why you'd be frustrated and honestly, good job for calling her out like that"
ckd3df,"I would call animal control and explain your roommate abandoned an animal. Ask someone to come get her. Taking her without permission is illegal. Reporting abuse is not

Edit: NTA"
ckd46d,"So, to summarize, your neighbor didn't want to wake her family up, so she decided to wake *you* up instead? I think you were too nice in offering to wait with her. NTA all the way."
ckd51r,"NTA

Your daughter really sucks at being a daughter.  Definitely don't tell her what you want for Xmas.

ETA: Do you happen to know if her boyfriend had to pay for his anniversary quilt as well?"
ckd5b0,"NTA. Maybe a bit petty but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Like you said, she is not really hurting the folks you work for. However, if they don't care it may hurt your reputation around the office."
ckd64h,"NTA

Your friend has a foot fetish, which he is allowed to have, but he’s being really fucking creepy about it."
ckd9zb,"NAH.  I do think you're headed into asshole territory for harping on this.  Is it totally fair that they get to ""spread"" and you don't?  No.  But life isn't fair.  Especially for deaf people.  Does it really bother you that much that in one small area you don't have more advantages than they do?  Just let it go."
ckdaps,"YTA - Is this a literal shitpost right now. Get out of here.

If serious: NTA for shitting, but no one is even talking to you. Mind your own business and stop purposefully listening in on private conversations. YTA for snooping."
ckdcc4,NTA. If she can help great but if not so be it. I’d help my kids financially in adulthood if they genuinely needed it.
ckde9p,"YTA. I’m in customer service too, and customers put us in super awkward situations like that ALL. THE. TIME. You have to understand what getting into a huge fight like that could mean for her job."
ckdfhy,"If she’s the one who’s paying for the dye then ESH, if not then NTA. Your hair buddy."
ckdfvz,"> (21 F)

That’s where it’s just NTA. No further explanation needed."
ckdl33,You could have written a thank you note and either mailed it or simply left it at their door if you are too shy to knock and say thanks in person so yes YTA.
ckdmie,"NTA. They're being weird. Hugging is not inappropriate as a greeting. The guy said it was okay for you to put your legs in his lap. He consented. Without even looking at gender norms, you are not the asshole.

That said, I really doubt that this is about the same kind of discomfort that a guy would experience being intimate with another guy. It's the kind of discomfort a guy may experience when not knowing wtf to do with the opposite sex. It's on them not you."
ckdovg,NTA the rule of thumb to get out of situations like this should always be go to the invite you accepted first. You accepted your mums invite on HB's behalf first so you go to that one. Always stick to your commitments.
ckdppm,NTA. You said it exactly right. Your loan is required for your livelihood.
ckdpyw,"NTA. Unless you said it in a different way than how you just posted it, you’re definitely NTA. If I had a condition that was like that I would carry my own straw with me to ensure I always had one. Hell I have two reusable ones that I keep in my purse."
ckdsft,"YTA

You kick a man out of his bed, when you could just as easily sleep in your own bed. Then you expect him to wait hand and foot on you (the request for milk came to you, you agreed, but then you outsourced.)

You are a selfish, entitled individual. Ergo an asshole."
ckdt95,YTA. He needs time to find a new place. It sucks feeling trapped and the situation my be awkward. But how would you feel if he told you he was moving abroad forever and only gave you 2 months notice?
ckdv38,NTA. Looked it up and you’re right lol. Also people are way too sensitive these days
ckdvej,"NTA. I've worked food service in the US for 20 years. Charging for tap water is not a thing. That server is an asshole. She tried taking money from you, you took money from her. Fair."
ckdzlq,[deleted]
cke1m5,NTA. That's disgusting.
cke46t,NTA: A good dog is better than this guy.
cke5b2,"NTA... Just because you’re younger does not mean you have to be the one to give up your seat. Also just because someone is young and may seem like it’s fine for them to stand, does not mean that they can. I for example have a fainting problem and get very dizzy if I stand in one spot for too long. I’m usually fine if I’m walking, I just can’t stand. ( yes I’ve seen the doctor about this, they don’t know what the cause is). Point is that being younger does not mean you have to stand, especially if you’re not sitting in the section specifically for disabled, old, pregnant people."
cke5tx,"NTA. You did the right thing. Even with the possibility of being put down, the dogs are better off in the hands of animal control than chained to a fence."
cke5ys,"I’m going to say NTA. yes that name holds weight for your husband. But the weight it holds for you is incredibly painful. And if he can’t see that naming your child after your abuser is a bad idea that’s a huge red flag. 

Its both your child. Equally. Pick a name you both love or at least both like."
cke6ec,"YTA- it’s hard, I get it. Your wife is going away for 3 weeks. Boss it up, rise to the occasion, stop whining and start YouTube-ing different hair tutorials.

You kind of sound like a bratty little kid, “it’s too hard, I don’t wanna, I can’t”

Don’t be that guy. Be the rad dad, the awesome husband your wife can count on to boss it up when she’s gone.

You got this."
cke7cz,"NAH

If he asks why its locked, don't make it about him. Say its just because you don't trust a dorm full of college kids. If he is a reasonable person he will understand."
cke81c,NAH your personal safety should come first and seeing how your boss hasn't yet asked you to endanger yourself he's NTA either.
cke8di,"You are allergic. Case closed.

NAH"
cke8z5,"ESH - your SIL sounds like a pretty self-centred asshole if her **immediate** reaction to your pregnancy news was ""well I'm not cancelling my trip"". However, I think is **is** unreasonable to expect her to cancel her trip. Your due date isn't set in stone, and it's unreasonable to expect that everyone drops all the plans they have for the weeks around your due date. SIL can meet the baby when she gets back from the trip, whenever it's scheduled."
cke9k1,"NTA.        
They won’t help themselves by going to get a mental evaluation or seeing a psych. Why should they ask you to do the job of a medical professional twice your age getting paid 6 figures an year?"
cke9v9,"NAH - is there a possibility that you spend like half or 3/4 of the day in the water park and go to the party in the evening? Or does it have to be the water park? Could you maybe talk to your parents, that you really want to go to the birthday party and you and your parents maybe do something else, like going for a picnic or something?"
ckea5r,NTA. It's a shirt.
ckeb3e,"NTA. It's your 21st birthday. They're supposed to buy your drinks, and the idea that you're obligated to buy them drinks is odd."
cked46,"YTA. Don't feel like you're showing up for your cousin. Feel like you're showing up for your uncle, who clearly DOES care about you."
ckedkg,"Sleepovers to discuss art? Yeah, okay. 

NTA - they’re already sleeping together. You pointing out that she’s cheating (to her and only her) isn’t being an asshole."
ckef85,"NTA - as long as others are on the same wavelength as you, and will still be smoking weed on this trip. If you are the only one smoking, expect plenty of resistance."
ckeibn,"100% NTA I think that’s a lovely birthday gift. Maybe your bro can have an “early birthday” gift of the same thing? Or maybe you can all do something together, like a small trip, where you each get a special mom day. Whatever happens, totally NTA for wanting this as your birthday treat."
ckepk3,"NTA

Accidents happen. He’s probably just upset because it scared him. Hopefully he’ll change his tune once he calms down."
ckeufl,"There’s no way I could be mean to her she is too cute! 
Funny thing is one of my older brothers I’m close with basically is also being hated on by them for when he talked to my mom about them leaving their baby when baby was a couple months old to go on vacation to San Diego."
ckeuvj,NTA. She's the one who did the things that got her fired. It's not even like you told management she was doing it. You couldn't have stopped it without putting your own job at risk... so that she could continue indulging her sex life with company resources.
ckeuz6,"NTA. You don't owe anything to your current company. If you're unhappy there simply leave. Personally, I would wait to have a written offer before quitting, but that's up to you. Good luck OP."
ckevu1,YTA you didn't even give the guy notice when you knew there was a chance you'd bail. Maybe try and pay him back for half of the trip because that was definitely an asshole move despite your intentions for your other friend.
ckex7e,You know you’re not the asshole here so why are you asking? You paid for your stepdad to perform a service. That’s it. There is zero reason for you to help him do the job you’re paying him to do.
ckey7p,At first I thought you actually like removed it from the ground and took it..
ckf14g,NAH. That's pretty normal for airport bars.
ckf165,"NTA I would encourage you to talk to them about it, but don't make it seem like you're attacking them because that will just put them on the defensive. It's possible that they genuinely don't think you would want to go, which is why they aren't inviting you, though them turning you down to hang out with each other makes that less likely. Good luck OP"
ckf1zr,NTA it's business not personal and frankly it's smart to use up vacation time before you lose it.
ckf2md,Use the toy and think about it afterwards. Post-nut clarity is a gift.
ckf4v4,"NTA - Your mother should absolutely take you to therapy if you are requesting it. Also, therapists usually can’t prescribe meds that’s a psychiatrist’s job."
ckf60u,"Yes YTA, boo hoo your weakness that burdens the entire family makes you a priority? Then learn to cook.

Say you can only eat pasta. I'm your sibling, so the rest of my life no matter what if I ever see pasta I have to wait for you to give me permission before I dig in? 

Calm down with that over dramatic ""if there was only a tomato I'd literally die"". We're all dying sometime."
ckf6jb,"NTA- it's clear she was just there for a free meal and she got what she deserved. I will say that your friends were right about the formal dinner off the bat thing, though. It's totally worth it to meet people over coffee or a drink first to avoid people like these."
ckf6yc,"NTA. I can see both sides of it. You live with your parents and in their eyes, are helping them when things get tight. Although they are really helping themselves. He’s paying you back. However, they should be mindful that it’s yours and not just take as they please without asking."
ckfafz,"YTA - you went against company policy. That’s all that needs to be said. 

Life advice: don’t take a job doing something you hate. You will be miserable, and it will radiate out, just as it did here.  You don’t think those kids can tell you don’t like them?  They can. Find another job."
ckfcoy,NTA - shitty employees deserve the shitty feedback just as much as great ones deserve great feedback.
ckfedv,NTA. It sucks when a spouse isn't in sync with the other and things like punishments aren't upheld. You may want to have a sit down conversation with her and discuss why this keeps happening and how you two can fix it.
ckff69,"Nah- it's perfectly valid to be afraid, no one can force you to do anything. Best of luck choosing what's best for you"
ckfg8g,ESH- just use your own plates. You can buy more at the goodwill for less than a dollar.
ckfhzd,"YTA. You're blaming your culture, you're blaming your parents, you're blaming your cousins. But all you have to do is put your foot down and say ""if you want tickets, you have to buy them. I've already covered X, Y, and Z."""
ckfjvf,"NTA, but I have to ask, why are you valueing your contributions to the family as less than his?  I get he's the only one that brings home a paycheck, but you're primarily raising the family, isn't that worth a little self-care?  He didn't apologize for the $1000+ gaming system, and you shouldn't either for a little [Treat Yo Self](https://giphy.com/explore/treat-yo-self)."
ckfl2h,"YTA. Not for the gift, but for expecting some sort of equal or greater return on gifts exchanged with friends. That's incredibly shallow and petty."
ckflpq,NTA. Give him the choice or get out. He’s killing all of you.
ckfnlu,"YWBTA if you dont let her know prior to the 'date', which is no longer a date in your eyes because you're no longer romantically interested."
ckfnpo,"NTA. They are the jerks who left their own kids unattended and then got wasted. If they'd asked you ahead of time to make sure you got the kids and THEN you got high, you would be the asshole. Asking you if you have plans and then not telling you they'd need you meant you had no reason to expect they'd call on you for this. It was very good of you to be honest that you couldn't get the kids. It was a total jerk move of your sister to take the blame off herself and put it on you, it's a convenient target. Maybe it wasn't the smartest thing to take shrooms in the woods with your family around, but they aren't your kids and you weren't in charge of them when it all went down."
ckfnqv,"NTA. Honestly, these guys sound like a nightmare. You owe them nothing, and it sounds like they've caused nothing but trouble. It would be best for everyone if these guys were gone."
ckfoxa,"I hate to be that person, but NAH. Your brother IS an asshole, but you also need to realize that you’re an adult and you need to get over the fact that someone doesn’t want to hand you something. At the end of the day it’s going to make you more responsible and teach you that you can expect something from someone else. You’re not entitled to your aunts car. She can do with it what she pleases. She’s already giving you a place to live. Save up your money and buy yourself a car when you can."
ckfoyl,Your sister needs to grow up bc 12 is too old to have a temper tantrum.
ckfrn9,"NTA,
It's your cat, you decide where she/he goes.
Plus, having cats outdoors can actually harm the biodiversity around you."
ckfuzr,"Nta! Everything you said is true, cycling on the pavement on a black bike with black clothes up to a car that just pulled up, you're just asking for a door to the face."
ckfvk8,"ESH. Your mums response was uncalled for but why does it matter so much to you. 

It's none of your business really. Your mum is with your dad so her painful experience is probably not one she likes to share.

And no, you dont have step-siblings. Her ex-husband is nothing to you. He's not your step-dad, his children have no link to you. Get over yourself and let your mum leave her past exactly in the past."
ckfw8o,"NTA Don't fall for the guilt trip. Mom is a grown-up who needs to adult better.

Keep your $."
ckfzcu,YTA for posting a validation post.
ckg068,"ESH, him for not tipping. You for basically guilting a man into tipping. You’d probably lose your job tbh"
ckg636,"NAH

You're not TA for taking classes with a professor who is an effective teacher for you. Your friend is not TA for having a problem."
ckg7cy,"NAH

People (in my opinion) cannot be TA for thinking/feeling something. It sounds like your father was trying to do something kind of fun with you. You should talk with him about this, and/or speak with a counselor if this problem persists or causes you great distress."
ckg7fs,"I seriously cannot believe some of these fucking comments.  My god.

NTA.  The fact that your kid throws fits of rage over taking a break for what, 2 hours max?  is a huge red flag, especially for a 16 year old.

Your son is not going to win three million dollars.  It doesn't matter if he practices every day for 12 hours a day, it's not going to happen.

Is hiding the PS4 the most effective way to handle it?  Honestly I don't know.  I'm not a parent.  But you're definitely not an asshole for doing it.  Video game addiction turns people into REALLY nasty human beings, and you're seeing this now.  It needs to stop before it gets worse."
ckg9xr,"NTA - you have diagnosed mental illness and your sister is treating you as if she thinks it's a joke.   


As someone in recovery with an eating disorder, I took my loved ones to therapy with me to set boundaries on comments about weight, appearance, my food choices, etc. This has helped my loved ones and me greatly so I recommend this method since having a therapist there really helps keep things focused."
ckg9z4,NTA: it's not your responsibility to fix people who won't even make an effort to fix themselves. The old analogy of trying to save a drowning man and both drowning applies here.
ckgaaw,"NTA. This is a totally reasonable thing to ask of a sexual partner, even one who had used protection in past sexual relationships."
ckgcqk,NTA but make your husband grow a spine and break the bad news to his parents. They’ll forgive him but they won’t forgive you.
ckge2j,"NTA. And 20% isn't the ""tip at least"" value. 20% is for stellar service, which is didn't get."
ckgfat,"NTA

I think this is survivors guilt, as you put it. You've been upfront about your plans, and gave (and worked) your notice. It sucks that they apparently haven't been able to refill their staffing roster, but that isn't your fault. Plus, it really sounds like you need a break."
ckghk6,"NTA

The only asshole here is your literal asshole for failing you when you needed it most."
ckgknn,NAH do as your grandpa wishes and if questioned just say grandpa asked you to do this and pretend you don't know why to spare the guest's feelings.
ckgkpg,"NAH

I've said this before, but I will not rule that someone is TA simply for thinking/feeling something. It's how we let those thoughts/feelings influence our actions that makes someone TA."
ckgnvg,"NAH: that being said, you really should go, as it greatly affects you. Control what you can to try and get the outcome you desire. You may end up with an unfavorable result if you don't"
ckgp72,"I’m gonna say NAH. Most people go to the doctor and ask to be tested for all the STDs, and don’t realize that doesn’t include a herpes test. It’s quite likely your boyfriend genuinely didn’t know he had it— most people don’t. But you can break up with him for any reason you want."
ckgpb9,NTA She must have some insecurities or something along those lines. You put your responsibilities first and that was the right thing to do
ckgqru,"Yeah, YTA

&#x200B;

There was no reason to do this at all. You're just letting her live rent free in your head.

&#x200B;

Let it go."
ckgrz6,"That’s ridiculous, it’s not asshole behavior to expect equal treatment."
ckgsdi,NTA. That’s not how lines work. It’s one thing if someone’s partner runs to grab another item or two while the person WITH the cart stays but to have someone stand there is so rude. I say good for you for standing your ground.
ckgskz,"NTA. And what type of stupid fucking rule is that? If its left out for an extended period of time its fair game? I could see that working for food or small, menial things but shit like money, make up, clothes ect? Get the fuck outta here.

Edit: spelling"
ckh0f9,YTA. Moving her dying parent to hospice takes precedence over a birthday that will happen again next year.
ckh2s4,"ESH. She paid for the realm and there seemed to be an understanding she had access to the account, so you probably should have let her have access to the account until the realm expires. She wasn't an angel either though, and you should definitely retain access to your account."
ckh8dt,"You can ask her to be the one to get a second job, but then know a lot of the household responsibilities will become yours.

Additionally, you two should look into money management classes or read a Dave Ramsey book or something.

NAH"
ckhe3r,"NTA 
BUT maybe she just needs a sit down talk. Maybe she is just alone and even if it is annoying I understand why she is bringing the baby even when told SIL can't care for it - what should she do if she has to work? A little bit easy thinking and disrespecting but yeah, I can understand her. 

Maybe you could makes rules for it. Don't feel bad, she doesn't seem to feel bad for her behaviour and also she seems to need you. 
If you're truly not wanting to have her around, okay, but if there is something you like about her or whatever, maybe consider talking with her first. Set rules, set consequences."
ckhetl,NTA. That would be like calling everyone on It's Always Sunny an asshole -- the whole point of the show is that they're all terrible people.
ckhf6w,"NTA. Bras are for personal comfort. If anyone thinks you're being ""rude"" for not wearing one, they're an asshole.

Is a man somehow being rude for not wearing underwear under his pants? No. He's still completely covered up. As long as your tits are being modestly covered (as this is a family event), there shouldn't be an issue."
ckhg37,"YTA - setting a trap to test a friendship is an ass hole move.


Goodbye."
ckhgu9,Story of my life. NTA

ckhq4w,NTA. Someone stole from you. You have every right to be upset.
ckhq87,"NTA it would be nice if you to TRY not to park in front of her house now that you know it bothers her. You can obviously keep parking there, but with the understanding that you have to weigh dealing with her against the convenience of the spot."
ckhqxm,"NTA

Grandma's feelings may be hurt but not being able to afford something is pretty straightforward."
ckhr3g,"NTA You don't want your kids around a bunch of alcoholics and that isn't a bad thing. Do you want them to think that is normal? 

You might find more advice on r/JUSTNOFAMILY on how to deal with relatives like this."
ckhtfr,"NTA. She is just as abusive to you as he is. She allows this man in her home with her children. She allows this abuse. She verbally abuses you when you try to reason with her.

Advice: leave as a soon and as fast as you can."
ckhvam,"NTA that guy sounds like a real asshole. Is so so lazy that he can't turn off the mower blades as he drives through your lawn? If you want to escalate, tell him to stay the hell off your property and call the cops if he does."
ckhwg5,"NTA if her SO is so easily lured by other women that's his fault, not yours."
ckhxk9,"NTA. 

If you’ve never sold a car to CarMax before- it’s the greatest experience. I’ve done it twice and left them a 5 Star Yelp review. They make it super easy and offered way more than any dealership trade-in. One dealership told me to run to CarMax, because that offer was too good to be true.

That being said- I understand why you wouldn’t want to do the extra effort and potentially lose money.

You can sell you car to anyone you want. NTA, but if you’re worried about fallout from your husband’s family- I would suggest this- go to CarMax and get your offer. It should be good for seven days- at that point state you will sell it to an instate relative for X + (buffer amount), since CarMax saves you time and money in the sale transaction whereas you’ll otherwise be wasting your own time and paying some fees. Give them seven days (length of CarMax offer) to give you a cashiers check or some other form of “cash.”

That way you don’t lose out on money, deal with the out of state drama or transporting the car, and that relative will be on the hook (since they’re technically selling it to the cousin) for any shady business he might pull.

If no one wants to stick their neck out for this cousin, that’s on them and you tried 😊"
cki04g,"NTA you shouldn't feel guilt tripped into going to church regardless of what day it is, but it's awful Christian of them to be assholes about it."
cki0bo,"YTA, but not a big one.  In general, it's not cool to disclose that to anyone without her explicit permission.  It sounds like you didn't have any malicious intent, though."
cki0wa,"NTA

He sounds like a bad father. Sorry to hear OP. I hope things are better with your mum?"
cki19u,"NTA My sister (21) is just awful about leaving rooms the way they were when she entered and she almost never knocks, but she does always close the door when she leaves.But this seems like a minor overreaction."
cki1c3,"NTA, your dad shouldn't be calling his child a bitch to his other child. You didn't ruin their relationship, he did, by being malicious about your sister behind her back. There's no reason he should have expected you not to tell her."
cki3dn,NTA its unrealistic to expect silence in a public place such as an airplane.
cki5bw,"NTA. You did not birth Howard's children, therefore you are not required to care for them. 

Howard: this woman is not your wife. You are not owed childcare from a single solitary human on this planet, aside from the one who you made them with. You are an asshole of epic proportions. When you chose to have children, everything else in your life became secondary. Once more in case you didn't get it: THIS WOMAN DOES NOT OWE YOU CHILDCARE, HOWARD. If you are overwhelmed and frustrated (with your HALF A WEEK!!!) it is time for you to hire a nanny."
cki8e4,I don’t think it’s illegal since they are replacing the face value of the cash... they are just paying attention to old or rare coins and bills which to collectors is worth more than face value.  Perhaps the 2 of you could team up and split the profits
ckige3,"NTA. I think your friend is right that your mom is having a tough time with adult boundaries. But you're paying rent, and you have a right to some agency and privacy. Put the baby stuff in the living room, and install a lock on your door."
ckigob,"NTA. Frankly, you're being pretty generous by offering to pay half. His laptop was damaged as a direct result of his own stupid prank."
ckii1k,NTA. You are telling them how to help you succeed. They should be proud. What’s unfortunate is that you feel like this is disallowed - and that communication with your parents is so poor that you don’t feel comfortable discussing this with them before you hit your breaking point.
ckiine,NTA for being honest.
ckijdu,NTA- They were both being unprofessional. Report them.
ckijw3,"YTA

This isn't any of your business.  Stay out of it."
ckik23,[deleted]
ckin1w,NTA.  It's ok to communicate in a mature fashion.
ckin6u,"NAH, but try marking them with ""Please don't eat all of these"". Put them out in the open, see if they continue eating them, and if they do then they are the assholes."
ckion1,NTA it looks like it's about time to think about cutting off your parents entirely
ckivgi,"This is some hardcore nerd drama.

ESH"
ckiwbk,"NTA

Its your wedding and you want to include your in-laws. Your mom has had many opportunities to be included. You aren't even picking out your dress. Its just a fitting. Your mom is being a tad bit selfish."
ckiwm5,NTA. The dude was being mean to the goat.
ckj32g,"NTA

Disappearing for a week or a month would be a hard pill to swallow, but somewhat normal for two busy adult friends...a year? No way. 

You did the right thing, this is a person who clearly isn’t very committed to the friendship. She doesn’t need or deserve access to your life via social media or otherwise."
ckj4s1,"NTA. Your sister is blaming everyone but herself for a problem that she's caused by failing to properly take care of her pet. If she wants to keep it, she needs to step the hell up."

It doesn't sound like you've done anything to take out your annoyance on your boyfriend. It sounds like things are getting better and that you're generally happy. Good for you.

Problem solved."
ckk464,"NTA. Your dad cheated on your mom with your stepmom, and your dad is surprised that his shitty choice is coming back to bite him when his new wife (the stepmom) is revealed to be having an affair? Essentially, history just repeated itself. You are nothing other than a person stuck in the middle of adults acting like children. Nothing more, nothing less."

cklqf7,"INFO: Are you sure she's trying to blame you for this and not more upset that you don't understand how upset she is over the damage of her clothes? This looks more like she's trying to get you to sympathize or feel bad for her and you failing to do that is making her upset.

NTA If she is saying you are the cause for her ruined clothes. She took part in the activity and had fun while doing it and simply forgot that her clothes can't become wet like that.

NAH If she is looking for sympathy and understanding and you failed to recognize it."
cklrr9,"NTA- coming from someone that was conditioned to make myself smaller so that other people don't have to, I wish I had the confidence to just stand my ground in my own lane like you are doing. It's silly isn't it?

cklwkk,"NTA.

Him having these troubles during the month doesn't excuse him from causing damage to your car, especially when you're making $8.50 an hour yourself.

It's nice of you to try to find a solution where maybe you could work something out, but you don't have to. He hit your car. He needs to compensate you, atleast partially (if you manage to work something out), in some sort of way to pay for the damages, even if they're purely cosmetic."
cklwvd,"NAH - I mean if it was just her he was harassing, then yes its her decision, and could have been dangerous if Nick found out that she'd been complaining about him. But from the sounds of it, you didn't mention her personally to the dad and its been happening with other women so its a big issue (and the dad shouldn't really be dismissing it so lightly). I'd encourage her to submit a formal complaint to your uni or the police, but if she doesn't want to pursue it that's her call."
cklzcv,"YTA. Big time. I can't believe everyone who said NTA. You're annoyed by them not cleaning up fruit that fell from a tree immediately? Do you also complain about leaves in autumn?

(he’s a DOCTOR? ewwwwwww. what a scumbag.) be teally rigid about this and tell hubby that he doesnt get to decide what women are creeped out by, it’s not his call to make and he needs to respect you and your friend.

ckoryi,"Definitely NTA but especially for this reason: ""  that she just can't bike to her job, because nobody does it.""  

That's not your problem, that's her personal choice.

Having been through this with my own sibling when I was younger, I started asking her for gas money.  Not much but it was enough that she didn't want to give me any and found a different ride."
ckosyr,"YTA. The fact you saw it necessary to mention her weight when you described her makes you sound like a mean girl. I would feel incredibly hurt if I was this girl and found out everyone in the office had been willfully excluding me. How hard would it be to just be nice? Sure you have no requirement to add her but you do not sound like a very kind person, and people have as much of a right to point that out as you do to exclude someone who seems to have never done anything to hurt you."
ckovfj,NTA. This guy sounds like a creep and you don't have an obligation to protect him. You'd be doing the community a service by protecting future targets of his. YBTH! (You'd Be The Hero)
ckp0on,"YTA

There is a time and a place for everything. You might feel like you’re exercising your rights, which you are, but you’re also being culturally insensitive. That kind of clothing might be fine at home (and clearly your dad thinks so, or he would have brought this issue up the first time you wore the shorts at home) but you are traveling and need to be respectful of other cultures.

I’ll give you an example. You could wear a bikini into a church, or even a courtroom. Nothing stops you from doing that, legally speaking. But you’d still be an asshole for doing so."
ckp2ff,"NTA

Too bad he didn’t get bit by the spider instead so he could truly know how you feel. Your husband is an asshole for not supporting you on this one. You are making a perfectly reasonable request."
ckp2or,NAH you can ask him but if it is some kind of corporate policy you might have to end having to accept it.
ckp4od,"NTA 

I don't think you're obligated to form a relationship with her but she might just want an idea of where she comes from, if she's anything medical to worry about etc. Being abandoned by a parent is a really traumatic thing.

I rejected a half sibling too, these things are complicated."
ckp4y9,"YTA

Sticking your left arm straight means turning left.

Sticking your left arm out then pointing up means turning right.

Sticking your right arm out also means turning right.

So you’re actually not doing anything wrong.

But you’re an asshole for not knowing what the proper signals are, refusing to educate yourself, and still being on the road."
ckp65w,Nta your friend is an attention seeking block of cheese. Who give a shit about her dog. The fact that she keeps bringing it up makes me think she's just trying to manipulate you. You are completely in the right to not go see someones dog but i would tell her the reason why you didn't want to see the pup and then see how she reacts.
ckp694,"Not judgement but...she's your wife. If you didn't trust her, why did you marry her?"
ckp6gb,YTA. Do you think she doesn’t realize that she’s struggling and needed you to shine light on the fact? Let her parents parent
ckp857,"NTA and your mom is being really really dumb and shortsighted. Lets be real about what is likely happening, and I say this as an attorney who has seen this multiple times: New Boo sees a honeypot. There is zero reasons to hand this property over solely to your brother, and I can almost guarantee doing so will result in your grandfather's legacy eventually falling out of your familes hands. Not necessarily that she we wed and bail, but eventually, maybe at end of her life and/or couple generations when/if they have kids the influence from her side will no longer care about the family tie to this property. Just how this always plays.

And understand, I see your moms side. This is her chance to bring her wayward son in out of the cold and into warm tidings. It makes sense, but the cost to do so is way way too high. It will be lost if he is given it solely. Its too big of a value. Heck, anyone with sense would tell him that once his name is on the deed, sell it and get a smaller place and live off the proceeds; cause that is the logical thing to do. The only reason the memory is being preserved is the divison makes it so that value is greater than what any single person would get out of it. 

She should not do this. She is dumb to do this. And she is an asshole to do it to the detriment of her other kids."
ckp9n1,NTA It's really up to you whether you want to go to your graduation ceremony or not. If it's not important to you then don't go. If you want to go then personally I would invite everyone and tell them all that the other have been invited but that they are there for you and if they can't behave like civilised adults for a few hours for your sake then they can refrain from coming.

ckpd46,"NTA for any reason whatsoever. It's your body; even if you had a decent relationship with this person, you don't have to do something you're not comfortable with that could potentially harm you!"
ckpmki,"Perhaps I read the post incorrectly, but dude said their COMBINED income is $35K. If that’s true, neither one of them has a job that is high paying, so perhaps he should re-evaluate his own situation instead of being so condescending towards what his girlfriend does for a living. 

I do feel like there’s a bigger discussion to be had that he’s not seeing, as a lot goes into switching jobs. She could be scared, feeling anxiety about her abilities and what it would look like to start over in a new field, stress about interviewing and what rejection might feel like, the fear of the unknown in general, etc. She currently has a gig that she’s good at, comfortable doing, and she’s also making money (regardless if you deem it ‘enough’ money). Please check your ego, and consider her feelings. Perhaps a different route would be for her to get promoted within her retail job. Becoming a manager, district manager, or even potentially working for corporate behind the scenes in some capacity.  (I see he’s commented on this option already, but I’ll leave it, because I think it’s still valid)
You also need to learn how support your potential spouse. Instead of holding your ‘high paying’ job over her head, perhaps ask her what she wants, and then ask her how you can help her get there."
ckpmoq,"NTA   If ""friends"" B&C just fucking took over the Xbox for an hour, they are the assholes. I'm wondering how friend A thought of the situation."

ckpo1a,NAH.  As long as you and your boyfriend kick in towards the cost of the rental
ckpofd,NTA. You shouldn't be forced to grieve someone else's way. If you need time take time. Your mom has no right to demand such things of you and presume to have the moral high ground.
ckppdb,NTA. You were providing a solution to a problem. Prosthetics are so advanced I would've recommended that as well. Tell her while she's at the prosthetic store to add a watch feat. to the arm to help with tardiness.
ckppio,"NTA

It’s so, so hard to cut ties with someone because of a substance abuse problem. But continuing to hang out with him will only enable his drinking. 

If he comes around and asks for help, then it’s up to you to decide where to go from there. For now, while he’s still drinking, you absolutely have the right to cut him out. It will probably even help him in the long run."
ckpu49,"Initial request for info: What kind of work are we talking about????  this is incredibly vague.  If she's asking for help putting up art for a gallery showing, it's one thing.. If she is asking you to prep canvases for her, that's another.

Voted YTA due to the kind of effort his partner is asking for being the kind of work that people help their partners do."
ckpysy,NTA - DO call child protective services. In some places they would rather provide financial help to the extended family to keep the kid with people who love them than place the kid in foster care. They can help you explore what’s best for this poor kid. 😕
ckpzft,NAH. A tad wierd but nah. Maybe crate the kitten while you go for it? Unless your masterbating for like 6 hours.
ckpzkq,"NTA

Is it possible for you to reach a compromise, where you cremate him but bury the ashes instead of scattering them at sea? All of our family have done that so we still have a place to go and talk to the person, to visit their headstone etc.

I'm sorry for your loss and that you're  dealing with this whilst grieving. I hope whatever you choose to do that things work out."

ckq9bl,"NTA - Why on earth would she bring a 9 year old child while moving? That's just a bad idea. You're going to be busy moving boxes, furniture, cleaning, etc. Things will already be hectic enough without a child to entertain. There is a much better time for him to visit."

People don't deserve your time and forgiveness just because they're old or related to you. I'm sorry that your grandpa passed away, and I'm sure your grandma is lonely, but that doesn't excuse this sort of behavior and you're allowed to be angry at her because of it."

ckqkaz,"NTA, this is something called ""guilt tipping"". To be clear, they are not literally asking you for a tip, the system spits out receipts with a tip option. It's the technology version of tip jars, but you have to clearly decide to opt out instead of opt in. 

Since they are being paid an actual wage, you're not actively hurting by not tipping."

But instead you turned the tables and kept your child responsible for their actions. Now the FiL feels bad for getting the kid in trouble, as he should, and the kid knows responsibility for breaking the rules can't just be pushed off on someone else.  

I say good job and hold your ground here. And I think FiL still needs to be yelled at for undermining you like that, what he did wasn't cool."

This is all you need to know. He told you up front what the nature of your relationship was. You convinced yourself it was more than that. But if it *was* more than that it would *be* more than that. You wouldn't have to ask the question. 

In other words, you shouldn't be pondering whether or not it would be OK to contact these women. You should be asking yourself whether or not you'd be OK being one of several. If the answer is no, then have a conversation with him about exclusivity and the status of your non relationship. If he doesn't budge on not wanting ""anything"" then that's all you need to know.

cksgj7,"YTA

Look, your son clearly sucks. Only reason that this is limited to YTA, is because your wife and other have done nothing wrong.

This is an opportunity to set boundaries for your son. Sit him down and explain that he is welcome to join you on this vacation, but if he is going to spend time with family, he needs to mellow the fuck out and act in a family appropriate manner. He has to go with the groups flow, not try to get everyone else to act like him. If he wants to do differently he would be better off not coming. I he behaves in a way that bothers the group, he'll be asked to not join you guys on activities and to figure out his own things to go. If things get worse than that, he'll be asked to find his own hotel room (assuming he is sharing.)

It is possible for him to share your vacation, where he does some of his own things and gets to be himself, and some things with everyone else, where he fits in. Give him that option.

I also wouldn't be afraid to be blunt with him about being exhausting. Make it clear that you love him, that you have no problem with how he chooses to live his life, but that his ways of living and socializing are not the ways of you, your wife, and his sister, and that it can be exhausting to spend to much time with him. He can't expect to force others to conform to his ways."

You are not taking the car just to spite her. It's your car. You own 100% of the liability for the car. **If she lapsed on insurance and totaled the car tomorrow, you, not her, would be on the hook for the entire amount. If she totals the car tomorrow and the insurance doesn't cover the entire loan, then you, not her, would be on the hook for the difference.** It makes zero sense for you to carry that financial liability and have no control over the asset. She is welcome to take you to court.

Also, she can't even re-register the car herself. You're going to have to do it for her. And she might not even be able to keep insuring it herself as she has no title, no lease, nothing.

If she wants the car, you can sell it to her for the buyout price on your loan. She can line up her own financing and you can sign over the car and pay off your loan."

Oh HELL NO. Do not get involved with anyone who tries to use something like mental health to guilt you into dating them. Even if he does have bipolar that is manipulative as all hell.

ckt45q,NTA. Those parents are trash for expecting you to let their kid keep clothing they had basically stolen from you.

He is trying to control things and it is a problem. One of the worst parts of being a DM is that because your primary job is making sure everyone in the game is having fun, it can mean that you have to make a hard choice about who does and does not make it isn' the group. People can be your friend and still be a poor fit for the group.

&#x200B;

The reality is that you are very close to being in a position where you could lose a friend over this (as stupid as that can sound). How you handle this is very important. 

&#x200B;

You need to set expectations for these things either up front and set in a stone in some sort of document or have a ""session 0"" in which the group decides on things like house rules, the game system and how things are going to work (I prefer having a session 0, since that makes everything a group decision, not just me). Either way works, but the important part is to set proper expectations. If everyone agrees premades will be chosen at random, then no one will be pissed. If everyone agrees that stats will be rolled at the table once with rolling 4d6 drop the lowest and place where decided instead of a point buy, then you are in good shape... but is some rolls like crap when they thought they would have a point buy then they are suddenly not having fun... expectations matter a lot. 

&#x200B;

Also... I highly recommend you play a one or two session story arc rather than a campaign to shake some of this out. 

&#x200B;

Anyway... if you feel he will have to control things all the way through and won't work well in a group as a result then he will be a bad fit for the game and should not be invited. If you decide this, then you may well piss him off enough to lose him as a friend. You have to decide if you are OK with that or if it would be better not to do this at all. Personally, I don't know that someone who got pissed enough over a game to ruin the friendship is someone I would want to be friends with anyway but YMMV."

I would argue that this has nothing to do with a transition. This is just a very one-sided friendship where one side makes it all about them, and completely ignores the other person and things that they may be going through. Happens quite often actually.  

Friendships, like any relationship, need to be nurtured. If they aren't then they will fade away and die. Having very one-sided conversations is a sure sign that your friendship is going this way. No one would blame you if you slowly started drifting away from this friendship."

Your friend's ""edginess"" as you described seems like cries for help, rather than attempts to show off or make you uncomfortable. Nonetheless I don't think you're an asshole for not wanting to risk having your birthday party ruined. Afterall its a day that should be about you, and you should enjoy it.

But if my close friend told me I wasn't welcome at his party because I might do something ""dangerous and inappropriate"", I think it would absolutely crush me. Given that he just got out of a mental hospital, it would be really shitty to say something like that. If I were you, I would have a tactful conversation about his behavior. Let him know you're there for him, but voice your worries about his tendency to self-harm and express dark thoughts. It's not your duty to ""fix"" him, or to tiptoe around his emotions at the expense of your special day. Just please don't tell him he'll ""ruin the party"".

He'll either get the hint and stop being inconsiderate or he'll keep doing it and you can feel fine either telling him off or just not hanging out anymore. You guys seem young and this is a lesson that your friend needs to learn. When you're with your friends you don't spend all your time face timing your girlfriend."
ckvxcj,"YWBTA. If your friend asked you not to bring weed to HER house, then don’t. Tell your other friends that you can’t. It’s not your call. If your friend is having you at HER house, you go by HER rules. She says no weed, then no weed. Don’t bring any."
ckvyeo,"NAH. It was an honest mistake, no biggie. I'd just pretend it never happened though, especially if it's still dirty."
ckvzg8,"NTA, just rsvp that you cant go and send a card with $$$. They won’t care - they got the gift and they don’t have to pay for your meal. Win/win. If this was your sister or something it would be different."
ckw22b,Man you lost me half way.
ckw3ix,YTA  if you keep calling her that. She has expressed she doesn’t like it or find it funny.  Why continue to do something you know genuinely upsets her?
ckw3zt,"NTA in my experience funerals have the effect of everyone trying to make themselves part of the planning. While it was probably her way to say goodbye, you’re right to defend his wishes and see the funeral carried out the way he wanted."
ckw7hp,"NTA. If he's a close friend, you might have wanted to pick a slightly different time, but he definitely needed to be called out on it, and you needed your stuff back. It just might have been a better conversation for private."
ckw881,"YTA

Lesson - When someone tells you not to do something that's ""just a joke"" to you, dont do it. That goes x10 for stuff related to work/professional life"
ckwbs3,Mid?
ckwbv1,"NTA. Your sister clearly has some issues that she needs to work through. She insulted you and your SO but also requests help when it comes to other things. She preemptively bites the hand that feeds her, what does she expect? There nothing wrong with asking for an apology. Especially for wild accusations of domestic violence which is no fucking joke, especially in today’s social climate."
ckwc3b,"You've learned a very difficult lesson: people are fickle, phoney, selfish creatures who will moralise all day but don't truly care about right and wrong unless it suits them.

NTA."
ckwcfe,"Yta to your employer if you don't charge. Essentially you are using work time and property to do a significant amount of CPA work for your family.  Your boss is justifiably annoyed with you using the time he pays you for non-work related activities.  If you can't do this on your own time, then it should be paid by you or your parents.

Edit for clarity"
ckwcms,"YTA. Your son did this because he didn’t know any better and CLEARLY felt remorse IMMEDIATELY. What did he say when you asked him why he did it? 

This punishment would come with no warning, and he probably would be confused and resent you. He was in a class where that’s what they’re taught to do ... so he does it, cries, feels terrible, is told it’s not okay. And, then he’s punished?!? 

Maybe I’m missing something ... again, why did he say he did it?"
ckwg1n,"Don't confront her. What you need to do is open a new account and have your deposits put in there. Without her having access to it.

Hell, call or go to your bank and request that they take her name off your account.

If you have to, go the prepaid Visa route. Many of those allows for direct deposits.

After she finds out you cut her off, then confront her. She's not entitled to your money.

NTA"
ckwgp6,NTA. But I wouldn’t give her a lecture on her habits. That will just piss her off. Instead I would just say I can’t bail her out anymore. And then don’t. It’s a hard lesson but some people have to learn it.
ckwk4d,"NAH - you two have different ideas on what your blended families should look like. I don't think you're wrong, and I don't really see any hard lines she's crossed. Just different ideas on how close she'll be too your baby."
ckwnmz,"NAH, but how would the roommate being friendly with the cat impact how it feels about you? Why can't you both like the cat?"
ckwnud,"ESH

Dads of this generation still aren't used to the fact that the method of job searching has changed from pounding the pavement and knocking on doors to mostly online. If you have been doing work all summer for temp agencies he should chill at this point and give you a bit more trust that you are not just sitting around the house playing games all day.

However, you didnt need to blow up on him, especially if you are being given the valuable courtesy of living rent free at home while putting away money all summer. You also dont have to rely solely on a temp agency to find you something."
ckwolt,"YTA. 

Just because you don't feel a difference doesn't mean it isn't helping her. You don't live in her skin, she would be the one to notice if it is helping or not.

You say her skin is sticky for 20 minutes? You can deal with not touching her for 20 minutes. Tell her that you think her body is beautiful but that you have an aversion to that particular lotion. That you understand that it's helping her but that you don't want to touch it. Ask her to respect your space until it dries. She may still be upset by this but it is far better than telling her not to use something she feels she needs. 


I use Vaseline on my lips every night and avoid kissing my SO until it has all been soaked in."
ckwqrj,ESH.  And extra suck for not getting over it in 5 years.
ckwrcu,NTA. She's obsessive and sounds creepy AF. Your wording might have been a little harsh but understandable given the circumstances. Dodged a bullet tbh
ckwsrp,NAH they're kids. Kids can be annoying sometimes. As long as you aren't mean and are open to a better relationship in the future when he's older then no issues there.
ckwv53,NTA even without OCD I wouldn't be comfortable touching something she touched with raw chicken hands. Especially with your condition you are NTA. Your mom needs to be more considerate with her actions and how they seriously impact you.
ckwz1n,You need both individual and family therapy. You and your parents all have some very serious issues to work through
ckx066,YTA to yourself for accepting. Why would you do this job for this awful person while admitting that she only wants you to do it so you can be her bitch? You should tell her thanks but no thanks and if it means not going to her wedding oh well. Would that really be a bad thing for you?
ckx4dg,"NTA - some people get into their heads to view certain people as worker bees.

ckxm3o,"100% NTA. Stipulating a child-free wedding, whether for capacity/fire code/alcohol-serving/whatever issues or just because you don't want badly-behaved kids around, is their right as the people getting married. But they need to accept there are trade-offs to this. They want the no-kid wedding of their dreams, there are going to be some people who can't attend for child care reasons. For them to get angry at you about that reality is unfair."
ckxmas,"NTA, why does he care? Miatas are awesome btw, keep it raw"
ckxmcu,"NTA--I assume you are hurt by this, and it's hard to want to put in the effort of giving a gift and/or card to someone who has made you feel hurt.  (Gift giving is supposed to be positive, after all.)

Parent 2 was pretty douchey about the whole thing...you were at a wedding.  It wasn't like you ignored them on purpose.  I get they don't like their ex, but you're their kids...come on.

THat said...  You could still be gracious and sent a small gift and card, though.  It might open the door to conversation.  It might not.  But at least you would have tried and could not be called spiteful about it.

Please try to talk this over with parent 2.  Their apparent bitterness coulld be depriving them of a good relationship with their kid.  I wish you luck!"
ckxpvo,"honestly? I’m gonna go with NTA. it’s true you could’ve gone about it better, but she needs to know that she was being a bitch"

ckxuyo,NTA. I’d say your landlord is TA. It should’ve been their responsibility to inform the tenants upstairs. It seems like you all have a good system that works alright for you.

But honestly when I was a kid living in landlocked Appalachia and went to the beach, I gave no effs about how perfect the shell was. I would’ve taken a plain rock home if it came from the beach haha

Maybe y’all go to the beach then go buy a “perfect” shell together. Or just gift it to her and say that you know the shells on your beach aren’t the best so you got her this one. It’ll be super nice that you thought of her 

Also, “Gaslighting” is not the correct word here and implies something much more nefarious"
ckybdv,"NTA, but does she have family you can contact? She’s clearly having a mental health issue."
ckycas,"Nobody is the asshole here. It's a crap situation.  But honestly, if you've already been exposed and can't walk the dogs for several weeks, why not just suck it up and foster the kittens so that you can know that they're safe and being taken care of?"

ckyd8g,"NTA. You're mom made you a promise that she has to keep, she can't just go back on her word like that."
ckyhtu,"Nta - You aren’t obligated to love anyone. I understand your guilt, but you need to learn how to grow from your guilt and not let it overtake your life! It’s not fair to you that you feel guilty over something like this. your dad sounds like a real creep"
ckyj99,"Where do you work?  I used to load trucks at FedEX, and there were plenty of female loaders back then.  

NTA.  This is a big reach imo.  Your comment seemed pretty innocuous to me.  To me it seemed more like a 'how can you criticize my wall when you've never done it yourself' comment more than a 'men build better walls than women' comment."
ckyjf7,"I don’t know, man. You have a ton of insight. This little girl has obviously done nothing wrong. And you recognize you resent your father. Has she expressed and interest in having a relationship with you?"
ckylnj,"NAH. Your in laws don’t seem like they’re being unreasonable, but your growing a fucking human. Do what you want to"
ckymdc,"YTA  
 It makes sense to rent your home to tourists for money- only if you have another place to live. People do this with a second home, or live in a smaller guest house on the same property or whatever.  
You're renting your only home and crashing at someone else's instead without contributing to rent.  
Of course your stepmother wants you to leave. You're visiting for a month and a half. It's *her* house.  
You both need to find different living arrangements during the summer if you're going to continue renting out your house. Maybe a campground?"
ckynsi,"YTA bc you didnt interrupt and explain you needed to pee or hang up and immediately call back / text “sorry had a quick emergency!”

Its partly being unkind to yourself, you are worth enough to allow yourself to stand up for your need to pee"
ckyoj6,"NTA. In fact, talking negatively about the other parent in front of children is in violation of custody orders. ANY custody order. If at all possible, talk to your ex about this. If it’s not received well you may have to look into legal avenues because once they are married, you won’t be able to keep son away. I would try mediation first. Definitely. Sending so much luv ur way mama ❤️"
ckyqp1,NTA: She might have sleep apnea. It's worth getting checked out.
ckysw7,[deleted]
ckytd7,"NTA. Sometimes people do shitty things but that doesn't mean they're necessarily a shitty person overall. If this guy cheated he should have to deal with the emotions and actions of who he cheated on, but no one is really obligated to stop being his friend on a moral grounds. Once you go dropping people for not always being a good person they're gonna drop you next time you fuck up. If your friend has always seemed like a good reliable friend up until this point you can be mad at him for possibly cheating, but leaving him wouldn't make sense."
ckyxlv,"NTA - it’s hard to trust someone when you constantly see them talking behind people’s backs and lying, so it makes sense that you feel that way."
ckz03y,"NAH but I mean, don’t hide the fact that you’re watching the dog while gf is out of town. A good doggo could even be an incentive for her to be open to trying for a dog of your own!

Good luck."
ckz0b4,"NTA

You may be a pushover but you’re not an asshole. The fact that you are turning to the internet for your validation tells us lots about your self-confidence."
ckz569,There’s probably some other reason she doesn’t want to go to your place. Is it gross? Do you have a weird roommate? Is it furnished? Is it cozy and comfy? Too hot ? Too cold? Figure that out.
ckz6x9,NTA .. plagiarism is serious and could get you kicked out
ckz75y,"YTA

What you have done is ask her to come back another day and have some else interview her. You should have removed yourself from the process given your history with her. Someone else should have made the decision."
ckzdrd,"YTA.

"" I know that I never want to be the guy to tell his GF to NOT see someone, because I know that that sort of controlling behaviour can only be toxic. However...""  I still want to do exactly that.

You reaction implies that either: a) You do not trust that she can and will somehow avoid sleeping with him; b) view the other person as actual threat to her safety; or c) you are insecure.    

But, you feel how you feel.  Can you learn to feel differently?"
ckzegu,"YTA for trying to make this into an insult. He isn't saying he's shocked *that you have opinions*, only that he's surprised when you bring them up, because it's out of character for you to do so."
ckzftu,ESH.  They suck if they knew.  You suck for not telling them that you found out the room sizes are different.  You could have gotten a really good deal on the bedroom due to the smaller size if you had found the room size acceptable.  You handled it immaturely.
ckzihi,"Wow dude. Social cues.

It's not a teen romance movie, it's a job. You're 22 and still trying to stage this corny bullshit? 

>Betty expressed some unease about my advances

This. This is the point where you stop. You don't ask twice to kiss her again, and then take the initiative to grab her, despite her professed unease and OBVIOUS disinterest. 

It's so clear that this girl had no interest in kissing you. You were totally inappropriate, made physical advances (!!), and made her intensely uncomfortable at her workplace. That's the very definition of sexual harassment. 

You deserve to be fired for your poor judgment and lack of social awareness.

YTA"
ckzj5h,"ESH. He's a cheater, you enabled his cheating and outed him, she's a homophobe. Sounds like the worst possible pitch for a Three's Company reboot."
ckzkto,"You're right that it's not at all a big deal, but yeah, YTA. But this is far more strange than asshole behavior, and I suspect or at least hope your husband will feel the same."

ckzr6s,"NTA, I think generally it's bad form to invite yourself to things you weren't invited to, and it seems like neither you nor G2 want that girl there. I would try to make it clear that the group doesn't want her there."
ckztrp,"NTA

You should of just told them you didn't sign up for this or was expecting that marrying her also came with a package of also marrying the entire family.

You married her, for her. It isn't your responsibility to be supporting HER family.

That isn't what you signed up for or ever wanted."
ckzul9,In this situation NTA you never have to give anyone money. But I’m cracking up that you took your headphones out then signed to her lol
ckzuvk,"NTA.  He fetishized you, most of all, but there’s some other general cringey-ness  that’d get real old super fast."
ckzvyn,NTA. He should respect that you don't want to risk being evicted for having a dog there and having your second cat exposed. See if he can have someone watch the dog or simply board it for a few days.
ckzxgb,"NTA, your dad shouldn’t have forced you to play if you didn’t want to. And he shouldn’t take credit for something you achieved through your hard work."
ckzz67,"YTA. You promised her that she would be able to eat some of your food specifically so that she could try something she hadn’t had before, and you really shouldn’t be eating something she’s allergic to when you two are together anyway, assuming that you sometimes kiss her.

All of the other stuff about you trying her food and her wanting to also try your food but never being able to only makes it worse. You were inconsiderate and it sounds like it’s a pattern where food is concerned."
cl017h,"ESH. You suck for pushing after it’s already been clearly established that they don’t want to work there. They needs to get their shit together if they wants to live with you quickly and frankly, you both suck for lying to each other about applications and not being able to keep a job. You both need to focus on maintaining a job and finding one you like enough to stay before you try moving out. You’re back at your parents for whatever reason, but there is a reason. Save up money, get it together, then worry about living with each other. If they don’t put in the work then tbh they don’t want to live with you that badly."
cl020k,"NTA Wow your mom is paying for your college? She sounds way too controlling. If she gets her hands on your bank account, she will just control that too. She would probably transfer your money into her savings so she could force you to ask for it. Sounds like she is already doing that with your college- if you don't do what she wants, she gets to take that away too. I would strongly recommend seeing about getting grants if you can, or loans on your own, so she isn't always holding college over your head to make you do what she wants. Definitely don't merge your bank account. You have a hard conversation ahead of you, where you tell her to back off and let you be an adult. Hopefully she will come to her senses and not stop funding your college but be prepared for the chance that she will be stubborn and too controlling to give up."
cl038y,"NTA, at all, but unfortunately you're probably going to have to allow the tracking app since you are a minor and your parents are paying for the phone.  Hopefully you're close to 18 and will be able to get your own account.  I fully expect them to want to continue tracking you even once you're an adult."
cl0cgz,"NAH it doesn't sound like your dad is stopping you, he just knows that you're at a point in life where maybe you might want to find your own place or just deal with college being expensive or whatever and he's trying to make sure you make a sound decision. Your not an asshole for wanting to spend your saved money on stuff though either"
cl0h64,"NTA Anyone who wasn't involved in abandoning the dogs can take it up with those that did. If the person who did it doesn't want to take responsibility, they're gonna have to face the consequences, both legally and socially."
cl0lus,YTA - this whole story is about you looking down on and mocking your girlfriend
cl0nmm,"NAH.

You fucked up and spilled some stuff, it happens. You're not an asshole for that. It would have been nice of you to offer to comp part of their meal, (not necessarily the whole meal, obviously, since it was clearly a sizeable one), but it's not unreasonable that you didn't. 

The people spilled on are obviously not assholes, since they took it in stride and didn't think much of it. 

The woman who paid is also not an asshole. A bit entitled for expecting a full meal to be comped because of a relatively small mistake (to be fair, you also sound entitled for thinking it's ""extreme"" to not tip you after you made a mistake like that), but it's the sort of thing where you would expect someone not to be tipped after that. 

No assholes, just an unfortunate situation."
cl0pd9,"NTA, you offered and have told her what you can afford. If she wants top of the range she can make up the difference herself.

You are not responsible for the crash, do not let her gaslight you like that. She chose to come meet you, you were not driving her vehicle and you didn't cause the accident."
cl0smx,"NTA lol they were literally just discussing a girl not liking getting eaten out and dirty talking, now they're suddenly squeamish about similar acts being mentioned but with gay context? Tell them to fuck off next time."

cl0urh,"NTA if there is ever anything to stand your ground on within your relationship it is this. I am white woman like your wife, we don't experience racism like you do (duh), like your potential kids will, if she can't learn to treat racism the severity it deserves she will not be well equipped to support any mixed race kids you have in the future. It doesn't matter if her grandmother doesn't know any better, it's about the impact on you. 

She has made this all about her when you're the one being verbally attacked. The GM isn't your responsibility, your MIL or FIL have got off easy having you do all the appointments, this time someone else can do it."
cl15b8,"NTA - it seems to me as though your friend is using their anxiety and depression as a cover to be a really toxic person.

She even says herself that she likes when people worry her and takes action to ensure they will. 

This isnt acceptable behaviour anxiety/depression or not.

Yes it may have been better to discuss this behaviour with her at the time of the incident but seeing her past behaviour I can see why you felt you werent(wasn't?) able to."
cl1ato,NTA. You're an adult. You are actually allowed to do whatever the fuck you want with your own hair.
cl1cfx,"NAH.

Sounds like it was a touchy topic for her. It's a risk you take when talking to strangers, regardless of topic."
cl1ejq,">  Maybe it’s the hipster in me 

YTA just for that.

But, besides that, *mother's day*? That day isn't for nothing; your mother incubated you in her body for 9 months and gave birth to you, and (most probably) raised you. You think the single day she gets, once a year, that acknowledges the permanent way she altered her body to grow you, is a hoax?

You don't need to buy things for Valentine's day. You can have your views on how these days have been warped to exploit people for money, but most people still like some TLC, so you can always put time and effort into the day; there's nothing wrong with setting up a movie date or using the day to cook together or something. Some people don't agree with celebrating birthdays, but if they care about their partner they make an effort. You can always find someone that shares your views, but you would be an asshole if you let your partner go through Valentine's day, watching other people get doted on, while you scoffed and reminded them that they would not be getting an ounce of anything from you."
cl1ewu,"NTA

Rate her how you see fit, but provide comments as to why, and maybe try to contact Doordash about it directly as well.  
As far as having her kid, Doordash doesn't have anything against it, many people being their spouses with then as well.

But yeah, you're not an asshole for reporting a driver for not following a simple request."
cl1f33,"NTA

cl1j6y,Stitches? Plex server? What are these
cl1rg7,"YTA 

  The timing sucks, no doubt about that, but your husband should be there for his friend. Unless something is terrible wrong after you've given birth, let him go to the wedding. Get a friend of yours to help out, or something like that, if you need it"
cl1ugg,"YTA. She is 22 and it's time to trust her to make decisions about her own life. Your behavior is just going to push her away.

Edited to add:

This also smacks of classism and it's ugly."
cl22hz,Hmm. YTA. I think in this situation I would also take the free one but know it is the asshole thing to do because she’s been holding it back for you. She could have sold it by now etc.
cl22p7,"NTA. Your group mate's future is his problem, not yours. If anything you've done him a favor because he'll think twice about slacking off next time. Actions (or the lack thereof) have consequences and he just learned that."
cl24cy,"> and she's an immigrant, so I thought maybe she didn't fully understand that this wasn't appropriate. 

YTA, You're the asshole in this situation and/because you are an asshole as a person."
cl2a1o,Why is there almost always a minecraft-related post on this sub every day? Y’all really beef that much in the game?
cl2c6h,NTA - if you just walk past casually they don't even bother stopping you. I don't think you legally have to stop for them.
cl2eff,"NTA- Cash, ass or grass nobody rides for free."
cl2exw,"Aww, my heart bleeds for your situation. I think you have already done a lot for her. 

I don’t think you’d be the asshole in most circumstances for ignoring her calls but in this one I’d say just barely YTA because you know she may not take the hint like other people would when you suddenly just blow her off. She will probably be confused and hurt, since you’re clearly not an asshole otherwise I think it would weigh on your conscience to just blow her off.  

Could you just tell her next time you talk that you’re too busy to call anymore and you won’t be around to talk because of the reasons you listed above? Just wish her the best and make it clear you won’t be picking up the phone anymore."
cl2jsj,"Wow! Dan  is TA. Textbook throwing-under-the-bus by Dan there. He didn't defend you, didn't explain, turned on you. Threw away a friendship to save himself looking bad. Just Wow! You're definitely NTA. Why would you want to reconnect with this douchebag?"
cl2p3m,"NTA. It's also very unlikely he will clear as much money as he is being told he will.

Working conditions on cruise ships can be nightmarish and being alone with a 7 month old for months at a time when that's not the life you agreed to is pretty nightmarish too."
cl2q64,"YTA here - sorry. 

Getting hurt about not hearing important news “first” or “from him” is a bit of a petty response. Aren’t you happy for his happiness? Why does this have to be about you? 

Your friend is not obligated to inform anyone in any order at any time. Perhaps this was more of a one-sided friendship than you thought? Ok - now you know. Try to find a place in your heart where you can be excited for him without being upset yourself."
cl2ul7,"NTA and your dad sucks. He gave you that money, you don’t need to give it back.

I’m sorry you’re going though this."
cl2x4w,[deleted]
cl2z7k,"NTA

I agree with basically everything you've written; it is her game, she never made you agreeing to play it contingent on you paying in the first instance, and it sounds like she is just trying to take advantage of you guys."
cl31jw,"NTA, you're definitely allowed to change your mind about inviting someone to your event."
cl32hu,"YTA, you said you sorted out the situation. Why the fuck would you want to re-ignite old grudges? 

Declining the invitation is exactly the opposite of ""moving on"", it's acting childishly insulted by an honest mistake someone did 5 years ago. It will also appear to your friend that you still hold a grudge, and that therefore, the matter (which they thought was settled) is not settled. They will, justifiably, consider your previous actions insincere."
cl354e,"Be gentle but firm. Tell her exactly why you would not want the coffee.
Option 2 is tell her when you get there you are sorry but in a hurry and pay and get out."
cl39ep,"Ugh this is a tough one. I’m going to say NTA, but I wanted to say N...A...H. 

Here’s the thing: no good parent would let their kid spend all their savings plus sell rare items for a trip. If they want you to be successful, they want you to save money. 

But I think it’s pretty mean of them to go on this trip without you. Can you sit them down and explain how much it means to you and see if maybe you can all take a family trip somewhere smaller and more affordable (either in addition or replacing it, depending on what works for them)?"
cl3bop,NTA it seems that there is a history of this happening i really dont blame you maybe let them but if they take something without permission they have to pay for it?
cl3cmi,Your sister wants to wrap up the estate and you are holding things up for everyone. YTA.
cl3d0x,"NTA - your sister doesnt get to dictate how you spend your money, irrespective of who paid for the trip"
cl3dr9,">From her perspective, the woman was trapped in the elevator and forced to deal with an awkward situation. My wife believes the woman could see with her peripheral vision and was aware of the kiss.

NTA, this is dumb. That other woman doesn't give a shit, I can promise you that."
cl3e85,"NTA, but don't participate in any other work events if this is how shit gets handled in this ""professional"" environment. The fact that your boss is taking time out of their day to talk to you about a fucking potluck speaks volumes about the importance of them actually focusing on things that matter - their jobs."
cl3fhp,NTA It’s good you establish boundaries and limitations for the internet usage. And it’s good to also get an early start of getting back to regular bedtime hours.
cl3fx3,"NTA , you had every right to see your grandma and to block them , keep them blocked I don’t know how they can be so cruel to not let you go to the funeral"
cl3icl,"NTA those are standard requirements needed to be named on this kind of agreement. She doesn’t have to give out her social insurance number for god’s sake. If she doesn’t understand why those documents, like her ID, pay stubs, etc. are needed, unaltered, she really shouldn’t be put on the lease. She is being immature about it when whining saying maybe she shouldn’t be put on the agreement. Fact is, she literally can’t be put on the agreement if she doesn’t provide the required items"
cl3low,"NTA

If you can talk someone out of something, they didn’t want it bad enough.

You’re just saving a lot of future pain."
cl3mnn,"YTA. People don't always respond well to difficult situations, so you probably could've let his bad attitude slide, but beyond that-- even if you think he deserves to get hit by a car for being sort of an Eeyore type, what did the car that hits him do to deserve your hostile indifference?"
cl3nlu,YTA for not calling CPS. Her kids are visibly thin and frail? That’s child abuse.
cl3ntc,"Nice of you to consider waiting until after exams.

Your cheater friend also had that option.

NTA"
cl3p0w,">  I'm pretty pissed off and still mostly drunk at this point, and decide to drive back home (about 20 miles and I drove both of us) and leave her there.

You just admitted to driving while drunk.  What in the absolute fuck do you think you're doing behind the wheel when you're drunk?  You're an asshole to your friend and an asshole to everyone around you.

YTA for leaving a drunk friend behind.  It would have been just as easy to tell Ben to write his number down for her or hers for him.  She was slurring her words, she was too drunk to actually consent.  He was drunk.  He deserved to be able to consent too.  She didn't steal Ben from you in any way.  You have no claim over being more than friends with him."
cl3pik,"NTA.

You already made reasonable plans and your mom already had plans to visit other relatives so I think she honestly just loves playing the guilt card and play ""poor pitiful me"" alot from the sounds of it."
cl3q19,"You’re not the worst kind of friend but you’re up there. Self absorbed, inconsiderate, and unreliable.

YTA"
cl3tmu,"NAH. 

She wants to show you off because she likes you and is unhappy because she doesn’t get to. All good so far.

You are prioritizing your limited time with your child over a social event, and trying to find compromise by attempting to switch weekends with your ex. Also good.

It’s all very frustrating, but neither of you are assholes."
cl3ymu,"NTA You weren’t aware it was her and you were just bringing a bad stall to her attention to save her from using it (not knowing she already had). People should be checking behind them anyway to make sure the toilet is flushing. And if the toilet isn’t flushing properly, they should be contacting maintenance."
cl432a,"NAH. Playing card games isn't ""teambuilding"" lol, she just wants some pals. You can't make yourself spend time with someone if you think you won't be happy. Just politely decline and wish her well."
cl45rc,"NAH, extra guests are expensive, but be prepared for single people to decline if you don't give them a plus one. Weddings are one of the most awkward places to be alone, so if you really want everyone to have a great experience you should consider that having someone to hang out with is a big part of that. If nothing else, please give a plus one to friends who don't know a lot of other people at the wedding."
cl46u6,"NTA, they sound really immature. Talking about sexual topics in a workplace is definitely not appropriate. Also, I feel like race really doesn’t matter in this. All you did was ask them to stop talking about an uncomfortable topic."
cl46xk,"NAH. It is their wedding and up to them. However, while it wouldn’t be crazy to tell your brother you feel left out- be prepared for an answer that might hurt you. 

Are you in the US? Many bachelor/bachelorette parties are drinking and going to bars/clubs and you wouldn’t be old enough which may get awkward. 

It’s totally normal for it to hurt your feelings, but they aren’t assholes.

Edit: weddings are also very expensive to be in. That’s another reason they may not want younger people."
cl49zd,"NAH as long as you don't bring it up. If I were Ashley and a friend offered to meet up for a chill and a coffee, I'd be pretty fucking pissed if they came out with ""so, you're about to get divorced huh?"" Don't do that.

Let her come to you, and don't let her think she's without friends when she needs them."
cl4gpf,"ESH y’all both suck, quit being petty or this relationship is going to end quickly."
cl4gzp,"NTA I understand your concern about his wellbeing but at the same time, you would also be an asshole for taking something someone confided in you about and then announcing it. You could be putting your boss in a precarious situation as well. It's not your job to police other people... anyone knows by 26 that being late to your job is horrible work etiquette and results in being fired. You don't need to tell anyone in their mid-20s that."
cl4hsz,"NTA, your mom is treating you like a child, you are just looking after your dad"
cl4jie,"NAH - but I think you’re wrong. If his time with his dad gets reduced now, he will almost certainly feel like he’s being pushed aside in favour of the baby, leading to even more resentment."
cl4jwu,"NTA

That said, I blame the bus driver for even letting someone on at that point"
cl4k1d,YTA - its isn't the clerks fault you didnt follow the rules ahead of time and fill the tank back up like you are required to do. Gas isn't free.
cl4ljr,"NTA

&#x200B;

Yeah it sucks a little but you know the situation better than them. Its probably great if you can make it but a white lie to smooth over the situation won't hurt anyone."
cl4n1g,NTA - your granny died and you just wanted to respect her wishes before she was buried. What you did was extremely beautiful in my opinion.
cl4opi,"NTA

Are you living in a hostel?  Because you seem to have a revolving door policy on guests.  Asking for a break from people other than the people actually living there is not unreasonable.  Your other roommates are assuming a lot by allowing this to happen and by asking for forgiveness after the fact instead of permission."
cl4pft,NTA. She gave them to you as a gift? They are yours then.
cl4q4r,NTA You seemed to have put up with a lot more than the average person would. He wants to be over controlling about everything? Then he can do it himself.
cl4qsz,"NAH. Maybe ask your family if anyone has interest first. If nobody steps up, there’s nothing wrong with you wanting or needing to sell."
cl4rkn,"NTA Obviously your boss isn't taking the hint, and he's being a real dick by begging you to stay. You did you duty and gave notice, even helped out a bit more than was required, which you agreed to. Lying to get out of it really seems like the only way to get out of this, and if it doesn't hurt someone, it's al good."
cl4urc,"NTA

&#x200B;

He's a giant asshole who lied to you and owes an apology. Its not like you sent it to the newspaper."
cl4wzu,YTA. He already told S that he had a girlfriend. S didn't talk to him at the last group lunch as far as you know. You have no grounds for accusation and it seems like S backed off.
cl4z8d,"NTA You put in the effort and that's what counts. In my opinion, I see you trying to build and keep the relationship with him and he's the one who is shooting it down."
cl50xb,"YTA. While this isn't something you can fix as a nonprofessional, this isn't something to be swept under the rug either. At the very least, actively pass responsibility to her family or closest friends instead of assuming her friends know."
cl521w,"NTA but honestly it would be hard to ghost somebody who you know in real life and go to school with.  If I were you, I'd talk to him about the issues that you are having with him, and if he can't accept it and try to work past them, then drop him, but do it in person."
cl53wu,Why take the urine test if you aren’t going to take the results into consideration?  You should have pushed back.  YTA.
cl5bmv,"NTA. Really confused by all the “YTA”s? You stated the waiting room is empty so who the hell takes the seat right next to you and proceeds to touch your elbow? Sounds like this woman has no boundaries. Like others have said, you would come off as an asshole to her but it is completely justified"
cl5brw,"YTA, hating someone for breaking something when they were a kid 8 years ago makes you this *already.* Wanting to emotionally hurt them out of spiteful revenge just makes it worse. Far worse. I'm not sure that this isn't a shitpost."
cl5dtw,"NTA- You’ve already given them gifts to try and ease their stress right now. If you loan them money it might turn into more loaning. Plus I understand that they want to celebrate a birthday but if money is super tight then they should wait until it gets better, so then they can just enjoy themselves.

Question- are they the type of people to pay the money back?"
cl5irw,"YTA It's your pet peeve. It's your problem. Stop making it someone else's.

Edit: spelling"
cl5jle,"Man I’m leaning YTA. 

Your heart is in the right place, and your obviously trying to do good. 

However a gym is not a homeless shelter, you stated one reason behind giving them memberships is because shelters close and kick them out in the mornings. But these gyms don’t. You’re advocating homeless people just hangout in the gym and use it as a shelter while the real shelter is closed. 

Also, you’ve stated when doing this type of thing in the past **junkies shot up in the bathroom of the coffee shop** that’s absolutely unacceptable, and in no way shape or form would I be willing to make the gym staff/customers susceptible to that bullshit. 

You say you have a substantial amount to tithe, why not sponsor a [Mobile Shower](http://www.washaway.com) (*these guys even sell these trailers so you could start your own nonprofit if you felt up to it*) for 1 weekend a month(or more) to be setup at the shelter or other areas with high homeless populations."
cl5n6y,ESH. She sounds like a total buffoon but you could have at least explained your issues and hashed it out like an adult.
cl5ote,"YTA light.

> she said she told me to go to physio and i didn't so now I've ruined her weekend and my poor choices are now effecting her

""Ruined her weekend"" might be a little over the top but i guess she .. is right?"
cl5pk9,"I'm pretty sure Bee has written a post about it here too? I remember it clearly, about 2 months ago, and the details were the exact same... I think it was NAH then, and I'm going to vote NAH for this one too, it's not your job to intervene, they should solve it themselves."
cl63ab,"NAH. Your sister went out of her way to make you a pie for your birthday--it sounds like she was just trying to make a nice gesture. In this case, I think the right thing to do is to try it with an open mind and thank her for thinking of you on your birthday. However, you wouldn't be an asshole for speaking up and declining a big piece of pie in favor of a smaller one."
cl63m4,"YWBTA because R doesn't want you to do this. He probably knows she's going to be ten kinds of shit to him if you do this. Just stay out of their crap and let R set his own boundaries. He's not a small child, you don't need to protect him."
cl650c,"NTA

Personally, I find it hilarious that speedos on men are gross, but the skimpiest bikinis on women is fine.

You could try a compromise with your daughter. She has to wear bathing suits that are just as baggy and cover just as much as yours do."
cl65im,NTA.  When you move out this kind of thing becomes a lot easier to deal with too.
cl65ub,"You DEFINITELY shouldn't have hooked up with an unstable stalker. All you did was reinforce that not accepting no for an answer is the way to get what you want. Stop giving a shit about his feelings since he doesn't give a shit what you want (to be left alone) and do whatever you need to get him to leave you alone (restraining order, etc. If it goes that far)."
cl69qx,"NTA, but I think you should be the bigger person and say happy birthday. It's possible that asking about Netflix passwords and stuff is her way of connecting with you. She is still a kid, and her bio parents don't sound great. It's unusual for a kid to ring her stepdad and say ""how are you"" (I honestly don't think I asked my dad that question until I grew up and left the country for the first time).

You're in a painful position, and I'm sorry your step-kids are not nicer to you. But just maintain a basic level of kindness towards them anyway - it will probably make you feel better in the long-run."
cl6b34,"~~NAH~~ you don't owe them an answer but you're hurting everyone by not sharing. Your boss is trying to save money when he in reality should be paying everyone fairly.


YTA - your responses here make it clear you hold rather snobby opinions of those with different levels of education than yourself. Changing my vote to YTA because of this."
cl6c4r,"NAH if you ask and accept her response, whatever it may be. 

You will definitely be the asshole if you “insist” on anything."
cl6c83,NTA. Frankly it's rude as hell to invite your wife and kids without you. You're a family unit. Your wife shouldn't be taking your kids some place that you're not welcome.
cl6dci,"NTA.  It's been two years.  She gave it to you.  It would be in the trash and she wouldn't even have the ability to ask if you hadn't accepted the offer.  You can sell them to her, but if you don't want to give them to her, then you don't have to."
cl6dg2,"YTA 

You need to decide upfront on your plans, which you didn't do. Instead you make a decision based on gut feelings and also ruin the evening of your friends. Moreover, you didn't even put effort into communicating to your friends, to reduce their involvement into your plans. Instead, they end up looking for you with the car. 

If you really wanted to be smart about your time, you should have simply not agreed on the movie and instead met your friends on the weekend."
cl6enb,"ESH/NTA. 

Dont get me wrong, hes a dickwad, but you are 21, and yeah he should have supported you more, but you cant expect him to support you, it was good that he did, but once you're 18 he doesn't have to. And IMO you cant be pissed that he stopped

I've been in a similar situation where my dad promised me 150 a month to help with bills then randomly stopped, so I was kinda fucked for a month, it was a shitty move, but he didnt have to do it in the first place so I wasnt pissed."
cl6ie5,I feel like you think you’re being cute and quirky but it’s actually hella annoying to everyone around you.
cl6jm8,"NTA.  What most likely happened is the people that complained spoke to each other and hyped it up.  

In a room of THAT many people if they had that much free time to zone in on one person being quiet then they weren’t paying attention to the meeting"
cl6kk5,"You made a commitment and YWBTA for reneging on that commitment. 

That said - life is short and mental health is valuable - so it might be worth moving on even if it means leaving them in a less-than-ideal situation."
cl6ol5,"If you’re concerned just talk to him.

Cant really make a judgement so NAH by default since he hasn’t said anything."
cl6osz,"YTA and don’t know what you’re talking about. Careers don’t have to be a direct translation from major in college. My career has nothing to do with my major. Her degree will teach her a lot of skills like research, critical thinking, problem solving, communication, etc. All of this is good prep for any career. Or maybe she’s the smart kid after all and wants to pursue higher education. There is value to being an academic and/or intellectual. ...FFS, she’s passionate about school. You should be encouraging that, you doofus. 

Regardless, different people take different paths and sometimes they’re not a straight line. Let her figure herself out like your other kid is."
cl6qw1,"NTA

He is an irresponsible pet owner which makes him the asshole. You were attacked by his dog which makes you not the asshole to put distance between the two of you."
cl6r5d,"YTA, you may be the only one who *usually* drinks it. But you say right there in your post that your sister occasionally has a glass. Plus, milk is used for cooking and nobody wants your backwash in their mac&cheese."
cl6wtd,"ESH.

IMO kids should be allowed to make up their own mind. No one here is letting your kid do that."
cl6x8h,"NTA, the comments are unwarranted and you’re far old enough to make your own decisions on how you dress. I used to get shitty comments from my mother all the time. It sucks and doesn’t change someone’s style, it’s just bullying."
cl6zla,"NTA, disabled people are capable of being entitled assholes just like anybody else."
cl726n,"NTA - People need to learn how to control their dogs. “Hard to control” translates really simply to “I don’t feel like taking the time to train my animals.” Regardless of why that is, if your dogs aren’t something you can handle when someone asks you to leave them alone, it’s a problem. Not really commenting on you here, OP, because I have a dog like yours and this situation doesn’t make you an asshole at all. We keep to ourselves and sometimes hang around with friendly dogs/dogs of people we know and are also comfortable with, but other people being obnoxious are a big no go."
cl729n,"NTA, seek legal advice."
cl72dw,Is it possible this girl doesn’t understand or know the true definition of the phrase? She could have heard someone else say it and be unaware of its true meaning. Just wanna throw that out there - I used to say so many stupid stupid phrases when I was a kid that I didn’t know the meaning of.
cl74c6,"YWBTA, if you don’t talk to her first? A simple, “Hey, I’m trying to work and it’s really distracting could you please keep it down?” Should work.

And if you’re an intern, it could either reflect very well or very poorly on your reputation based upon the office situation."
cl754k,"NTA

You were trying to do him a solid when you accessed his car, his car was already broken, you didn't do anything unreasonable that broke it further, and you offered to help cover the cost of repairs, at least partially.

Your friend knew it already needed repairs, so it should not have been a surprise that it finally crapped out, nor should he have blamed you for being there for the final straw. It was your friend's choice to be mad about something he knew was a problem already, continue to be mad after you tried to make it right more than once, and refuse your multiple offers of assistance.

I would have stopped sympathizing after the second day of his behavior - you were positively saintly!"
cl76bi,"NTA. I won't recommend family members for jobs and they are understanding about it. That is putting your reputation on the line. If he isn't understanding about it then that says a lot about who he is as a person and as a friend.


EDIT - Because I'm seeing a lot of ""pass the CV along but tell your boss he's a bad fit"" - that makes you look bad. Like you can't say no to someone who isn't even a good friend. Saying no is a huge part of management and your boss might think less of you as an employee if you go that route."
cl76fa,"NTA you’re a grown woman. You don’t need “permission” to do as you want. If you want to maybe smooth the waters, have him ask for their blessing as opposed to permission."
cl77n0,"NTA. 

Your boyfriend seems to be having problems cutting the apron strings.  If his mother is as lovely and understanding as you say she is, she will understand that a couple needs space to be a couple, and that you have your own financial worries without her being added in.  Especially if she is not elderly/infirm.

**Edit**:  I’ll amend my initial judgement on having trouble cutting the apron strings after seeing the response below about the circumstances growing up and wanting to help her out because I *do* understand that all too well.  There are plenty of nice things to do for her that don’t involve paying her rent ad infinitum.  You can’t cut your legs out from under yourself."
cl77wv,"NTA, your mom is strict and it’s hard to spend time with strict parents. If you having fun is wasting time to her of course you won’t want to spend as much time as her. You and your sister being close is a great thing and it’s great that you spend as much time with her as you can."
cl7a1w,"NTA.

If you feed this particular stray, it will never go away.  He’s in his own situation because of his own doing. Not because of a sudden catastrophic event.   He married your mom, not you, so his alimony is absolutely not your burden to bear. 

He’s using the path of least resistance.  He will find a way."
cl7bg8,"NTA, you asked both parties and they were cool with it. I think it's a good judge of the guy's intentions that he was happy to have you there, proves to me that he did actually just want to meet his friend (and I'm sure she'd talked about you)

I think you would only be in the wrong if you'd tried for forbid her from going without your permission or something."
cl7cfl,NTA - I’d say you could go as far as moving the stinky trash to their desk and still not be an asshole
cl7dvy,NAH I'd just be really careful about how you break the news to her
cl7gtf,YTA. why does it bother you? He’s a kid. And you’re his father figure. It’s not hurting anybody and probably makes him feel safe and loved.
cl7mou,YTA. This isn’t your fight. Your girlfriend is the one telling you the mom said it was all set. You actually don’t know that for sure. Given how willing your girlfriend is to pay it back chances are she knew she would have to pay it back.
cl7n2l,"NAH.

you like to recline, he likes his window seat. Luckily, both of you don’t have seatmates. No one’s being particularly unreasonable.

Another solution: offer to trade seats. That way. Your recline wouldn’t bother him and you both keep window seats! YEY!"

You didn't ""do"" anything to feel badly about, since you never made a concious decision to ruin anything. Having a panic attack is absolutely out of your control, no way you're an asshole about it or any of your conditions. You told your parents ahead of time, they ignored you, now they face the consequences. Clearly they don't know enogh about how to deal with an autistic kid. Don't let them shame you simply for being different than them."
cl7oke,NTA litterally had a buddy do the exact same thing. Cops let him keep the dog
cl7pc7,"YTA The rules are only arbitrary if the people who sign your checks think they are. If you’re caught sleeping, I wouldn’t expect it to go well- work done or not."
cl7qk1,YTA it isn't your decision. Also if he's never eaten meat you could cause digestive issues.
cl7rgg,NTA and I can see why he's your ex.
cl7rq8,NAH. I wouldn't say you're the asshole for being a concerned husband. Just make sure you don't stray from being a concerned husband to one who tells his wife what she can and can't do.
cl7tkz,"NTA. There’s something to be said for calling people out on their bullshit.

Of course, that being said, beware of the stirred pot, as some of the contents might spill, and make a mess."
cl7u16,"So the major problem here is that you valued the surprise of the ring over confirming your partner’s tastes, and even her desire to wear a ring. For a successful marriage, you need to have communication skills — that’s way more important than keeping someone from realizing a surprise. 

Moreover, an engagement shouldn’t be a surprise, not totally. Sure, the actual asking of the question is often a wonderful surprise, but both parties should know engagement is on the table and maybe even a rough timeline for when. A lot of people like being included in the ring selection process, or they may have limits on what getting engaged looks like (a public versus private setting, for instance). 

So I can see where your girlfriend is coming from. I also think you were well intended. But you can’t let this disagreement fester. Sit down with your girlfriend and ask her about her reaction without telling her she reacted in the wrong way. 

Ultimately I think ESH because no one seems to be talking to one another about their thoughts regarding major life events."
cl7vfm,"NTA - you're entitled to know who is in the house with you and the child you have a responsibility to look after. I would have been really freaked out to know that someone was in the house with me the whole time and I knew nothing about it.

If he wasn't doing anything shady that his mom would be cool with he wouldn't have been hiding the girl upstairs. Instead he took advantage of the fact that you were home and not his mom. You did the right thing by telling her."
cl7vrp,"YTA. Whenever anyone claims to the ""best something in the something,"" it sounds arrogant. Learn how to be confident without sounding arrogant."
cl7xhq,NTA if someone sticks an ice cube down my shirt my first instinct is to push them away so you can expect even if someone isn’t purposefully trying to get revenge this kind of thing might happen
cl7xko,NTA. You don't *have* to give anything to anyone. So you're certainly allowed to choose who you give it to.

The left lane is for passing and passing only. Read that again. Now twenty five more times.

If you aren’t passing anyone you shouldn’t be in the left lane. Doesn’t matter how fast you’re going. The guy behind you wanted to go faster and he couldn’t pass you on the left because... you were in the left lane. You just blocked him for no good reason. 

I hope it’s because you didn’t know better, but better to understand this now because there are thousands of idiots who clog the passing lane their whole lives."
cl89fm,"NTA, I'd do him the courtesy of giving more than 30 days notice but other than that can't really blame you"
cl8gia,"NTA

She’s the asshole for not respecting your diet. The alternative would’ve been for you to just take them home and throw them all out so I think you did the right thing."
cl8kbt,"NTA, this is great. I hope they smell it and hate life in that moment but you might open your door to a burning box of shit someday."
cl8ncb,"YTA. Sounds like the man was trying to have an adult conversation with you and you acted like it was the Inquisition. I'm not going to let some random stranger stay at my home if I don't have a basic understanding of the relationship. You didn't have to tell intimate details but jeez give the guy something. Don't want them knowing your business, get a hotel room for you and your guest."
cl8nqq,"NTA. That's messed up man. Your shoulder is injured, but she ignores it? If she can afford to hire someone, then she should. I don't see why there's any reason to force her injured kid to do these things."
cl8oak,[deleted]
cl8pj0,"NTA

She's being kind of ridiculous over 2 hours.  She's there for a week, if I read that correctly, so it's not like you're using up a huge chunk of your time together."
cl8qvv,NTA at all but you might not get far if you dont play the game. It sucks but that's life.
cl8rzs,YTA for thinking an ultimatum is “funny” or “brilliant”
cl8tf8,"YTA: This was the wrong way to handle this. Why would you take away rights in an effort to make things more equal? You should have focused your attention on trying to get men more rights with their clothing.

I can't imagine any situation where the correct move is, ""Hey, we want equality... Rather than giving them this, let's take away from this group!"""
cl8uig,NTA but unfortunately if it isn't your house then it's really not up to you whether he stays there or not.
cl8x9e,NAH. I mean yeah cheating sucks but if he was in an abusive relationship I can see why he wanted to be with someone else. It’s ok for you to be concerned about cheating so you’re not an ahole but I’m not really judging him that hard either.
cl8zmw,"ESH.

You, because you let down all of your school colleagues. 

Your dad is also an asshole because he hit you.

I’m also wondering whether your dad wanted you to continue till the end of the year to show you once you commit to something you should see it through, but even without that info I can judge that everyone sucks here except for all the participants of the concert who were let down with you just not showing up."
cl9030,NTA But are you sure that is a best business move for you?
cl9258,"NTA, but generally I feel like using a horn is better for this type of situation because it is more universally recognized."
cl95yy,"NTA, because of your MIL’s insensitive comment. I would keep that person at arm’s length, too. It’s also perfectly reasonable not to want your child around a huge poorly-trained dog."
cl96ho,"NTA. Having a disability doesn't give him the right to harass you or your child. He follows you around and is showing a disturbing interest in you and your baby. This sounds like the beginning stages of stalking. If the admin of the group doesn't take that seriously, it's not a safe group for you to be in."
cl96wi,"NAH - But if this sharing continues new policy falls into place. Daughter wants to use hot tub, she must get her parents to text you so that you know she has permission. 

She was in the wrong for lying (which makes her maybe a little bit TA, but also a typical 12 year old), and if I were her parents I wouldn’t blame you - there would be a punishment for my daughter 100%. Why they thought it was your responsibility to reach out to them is beyond me... especially when she had used the hot tub on her own before without you double checking."
cl97up,"YTA You seem to be mostly pissed that they didn't just offer to babysit your kids, or help clean up after them, or give them the best room in the house. So, in other words,  you seem to have expected them to cater completely to you while you were there, and since they didn't, you threatened to not visit them again for several  years."
cl9f6w,"NAH 

I feel like this needs no real explanation. Overall no one is an asshole. You did all you needed, and it was his responsibility for checking if everything was in order before leaving with the camper. You don’t know if he could have done anything to it after he had left the property, either. 

I think he’s fair to ask for a refund if he’s being truthful, but youre not obligated to give it to him nor should you feel bad for denying it."
cl9f7y,"NTA. 

It really does sound like the boss was the one who over-promised. It sounds like the deal you made with the boss was very, very clear, and the boss failed to work it out correctly with the cleaner. The boss is TA, not you."
cl9h2j,"Yeah, don't do that. They already ""paid"" you with 2 year's free rent, I presume that's how you're in a position to lend them $14k while paying for your education at the same time?"
cl9iit,"NTA. He’s an adult. He should be helping out. If not by paying rent, then by doing something to contribute like cleaning, grocery shopping, something."
cl9izd,"NTA, you were just excited to see Batman."
cl9ji5,Oof. You really need to get thicker skin if this hurt you this much.
cl9kpe,"ESH

I mean, you didn't mean to, but you can't fall asleep when you're being paid to watch a couple of kids that young.

Him refusing to pay you for the entire week is way out of line."
cl9pta,"NTA, look at it the opposite way. If you had ""AITA"" for getting my sister who has a bad work ethic a job, you would be the asshole for nepotism."
cl9r80,"ESH, but that's just my opinion. I can see why others think you did nothing wrong, but you literally did the same thing you're upset with her for doing. Maybe next time, confront her specifically and tell her she shouldn't be doing that. Good for you for standing up for your friends and yourself though, really! You're a good friend."
cl9tlu,"NAH unfortunately this isn't a long term solution.  You both know that. Your wife needs some serious help with a counselor or therapist. 
You said that it started when you had a cancer scare, eating, and purging was probably the only thing she felt she could control. Assuming that you are now fine, she may need help to redirect the urges to a healthy outlet."
cl9u1q,Failing at something most other people succeed at isn't being an asshole.
cl9u8o,"NTA. Your mom is being ridulous. And if she's been wearing an awareness band for 4 years and people don't even know what it's for, she's not actually raising awareness about anything, she's just wearing ugly jewelry."

> Well she said I wasn’t doing anything suspicious, she does this to everyone she dates.

My man you need to get out of..

> Well because of this I have gone through her phone

Oh..

> and then weeks later when I check back

Oof."
cla5gf,"NTA. Why isn’t he taking care of the house/kids on Mondays and Tuesdays? Your husband’s a dead beat who does this because it’s easy, and he needs a serious wake up call. That kind of attitude leaves the overburdened partner (you) seeking divorce more often than not."
cla7no,"NTA and you're not cutting them off for your girlfriend, you're cutting them off because they're nasty people who don't respect your choices and are trying to bully you into dating someone you don't like."
clacp5,"NTA. They are treating you unfairly. Having said that, you are 17 and maybe they think you should be able to work for, and buy yourself a better phone?"
cladb7,"NTA go for it

clafb3,"NTA

If you are just mildly grumpy, you are doing better than I would be! If by some chance they are unreasonable enough to make you guys drive everyone at the last minute in a car you hate, there is still NO way that you should have to pay for the gas."
clajb1,NAH. You misunderstood thinking she would be texting you when she landed. She's also got a right to be a bit upset when she had to wake an extra bit after a plane ride.
clakj5,"NAH but for future babysitting endeavors, you have to redirect a child that age into an appropriate activity. So you give him something to hit with his hammer that’s safe, and sit and play with him to show him how to limit his hammering. If that doesn’t work, after you take away his hammer you need to give him something else to play with and encourage him to a different kind of play."
clalhc,"ESH

You both cheated. You are both guilty. Just stop doing that. It doesn't help your sister because she learns nothing and has zero consequences. If she doesn't want to get educated, you need to let her deal with the consequences herself. If you do get caught, be aware, you will both be in trouble."
claoai,"NTA. Your boss sounds like a jackass. Paid personal days are *personal*. And two days out of a few aren’t a huge deal. I can see if she’d be suspicious, since the days weren’t consecutive, but it’s not like you schedule your mental breaks ahead of time."
claol5,"NTA

Your stepfather is the asshole here.  I'm, well, older than you and a fully-fledged adult and I pick up new hobbies on the regular. My buddy is 45 and he skates with his teenagers.  Pickup your hobby, see how you like it.  Even if you don't like it and don't skate in a year, you tried it and decided it for yourself."
claop9,"NAH: they are not your kids and therefore not your responsibility. 

You can explain why you could not babysit that day and suggest do it an other day so she can go out/so something for herself."
clatne,"NTA.

Also probably not legal though.

Have you already signed the lease?

Because this is setting off all kinds of warning bells about the kind of landlords these are going to be."

claudg,NTA sounds like you are being abused by irrational bigots
claygs,"NTA.  However, it would be nice if the person who brought him into the group let him know why he's being excluded.  Yes it should be obvious, but some people need etiquette explained to them."

EDIT: also NTA but your bf is and so is his family."
clazmv,"NTA.

You're entitled to your personal privacy.

Your dad is an asshole for saying you don't get to set boundaries in your own space."
clb3v4,"NAH, small dogs may be easier to control, but if you can't handle it because there are more of them it's better to ask for help than to take bad care of them since you would be to afraid to ask. Then no one wins since the dogs aren't as well kept and you stay quiet, it's also a good team bonding time between you and your coworkers."
clb6na,"YTA.

Listen. I have ADHD (Combined type!) and she sounds like she COULD be inattentive - but also, there are UNMEDICATED people with ADHD who DO that shit. In fact, ADHD is criminally undiagnosed in women FOR THIS REASON - they're more likely to do things that folks with ADHD ""can't"" due to a lot of different reasons.

BUT EVEN SO: It's just not your business? The stigma around ADHD sucks and I *do* wish more people took it more seriously (I think it should be classified as a disability!) but if she's saying she thinks she has ADHD, then she obviously struggles with *something.* What reason would she have to lie?? I'd argue ADHD is one of the most stigmatized disorders out there to have.

Like, so she gets extra time on tests...? If she is utilizing said extra time, she needs it, ADHD or not! Feel free to just not like her in general, unrelated, but I really fail to see who she is hurting here. People who do lie consistently about mental health and other stuff of the ilk usually DO have *something* going on - people generally don't lie like that for funsies. 

Just.. relax, and ignore her. There's no issue here."
clbaxg,"NTA, she wouldn't want to wear a pantsuit and blazer in this heat. I'm assuming she gets to wear a dress?"
clbe7w,YTA. Even if your boyfriend said it was fine someone should have checked with the mother. In general both parents need to agree on something especially if it something like a piercing where itaffects her body.

clbf3n,"YTA if you don't kick him out as soon as you get done reading this.

clbfkk,"NAH. Having people get mad at you is a pretty standard part of the canvasser experience and giving would have been a good thing to do, not an obligatory thing to do.

In reading this story it also sounds to me like you jumped in as soon as you realized how large the financial ask was, so I don't think it would be fair to say you wasted their time. Another standard part of canvassing for money is engaging someone for as long as possible before you make a big ask in hopes that the amount of time spent will create a sense of obligation about taking your time, in hopes of making them feel like the use of their time is now something they have to justify, etc. All that happened is that their tactic didn't work."
clbk2f,"NTA, op I don't really understand why you would need to spend 60% of your income? You said your sisters works too?

Is there a reason you can't sell the house/your mom can't move to a tiny apartment?

I understand it's not the most fun way to live but I'm sure your mom understands that her mid 30's kids want to start living"

clcugh,NTA. The aunt clearly used her daughter to communicate with you to try to get the stupid mopeds.
clcv0y,YTA - it seems like you let this fester for a long time and then blew up at your friend because she had a prior commitment. You should have spoken to her calmly instead of just being silent and then jumping all over her about it.
clcw7g,"NAH. I’m genuinely so sorry this happened to your family. Everyone deals with loss differently, and your brother didn’t handle it very well, or just stayed in denial and didn’t deal with his feelings. The thing that sucks is that healing comes from within, and he has to want to be better for the change to happen. You can try to encourage this in different ways, but he might feel like you’re patronizing him."

cld05c,NTA - Its stupid for someone to ask you to pay them back for a gift that you never asked for. if you wanted to buy it you would have gone out and bought it.

cldjag,"NTA. You're growing in a direction which makes you feel more accomplished and fulfilled. You can still interact with this person outside of gaming, and they should be able to accept that just because the two of you enjoy different activities doesn't mean the friendship has to suffer. If the guy continues to give you grief just for growing as a person, then they have some things they need to grow through themself, and that's not your problem.

You're not the asshole for making jokes about what you've been through, having a coping mechanism is fine.

You are an asshole for not respecting that not everyone finds this a helpful way of dealing with trauma and telling her that what she experienced is funny to you is not okay. Joking about someone else's trauma is not the same as joking about your own - especially when she doesn't know you've been through the same thing...how do you expect her to interpret it as anything other than you mocking what she went through? 
You knew she was 10 feet away from you and you're in HER house.

I would suggest you talk to her about this, explain why you make jokes about it, apologise for what you said and not to make those comments in front of her. What's helpful to one person can be hurtful to another."

clf24i,"NAH - hear me out. Clearly you're not the asshole, I think most women would feel some kinda way about finding out their ring was given to someone else first. 

But because of its family significance, I won't call him an asshole. It's obviously important to him that this ring go to the woman he plans to spend the rest of his life with, and his ex wasn't that woman. So in his eyes, this ring was meant for you. 

If it was a ring he picked out specifically for her, then I would call him the asshole. But I think it being a family ring makes it different."

If he's already lining up coke and has the money to burn on coke before the ripe age of 21, maybe even 18 from what little I have to guess from, he's lining himself up for a world of hurt and pain if he can't even admit to the coke when you saw it blatantly happening and let him slide. If he's lying now he really needs help"

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
clgf9i,NTA. For obvious reasons. Also the law's on your side.
clghyk,"NTA, go for it"
clgid8,"YTA. Woah. That is a major intrusion, and I’d be very worried by a therapist that would be willing to share any details about your partner’s condition to you anyway.  

If you have concerns that you’re incompatible for mental/emotional health reasons, don’t move in yet or at all."
clgna5,"NTA, obviously.

Firstly, letting him in would possible be a crime itself, aiding and abetting or something, hiding a criminal, harbouring a fugitive, hindering investigation/arrest etc.
Secondly, its not your house. By letting him in you could have forced your parents to get mixed up in this unlawful mess. 

You might want to prepare to be spoken to by the police, depends on what your friend says to them under investigation, will he throw you under the bus as you ""allowed him"" to hide in your garden? 

Strongly consider talking to your parents about this. 

Disclaimer: I am in no way knowledgeable about law and police matters, in your country or my own. But it sounds like this might escalate by the volume of police involved. Good luck."
clgnvf,"ESH. It *is* rude. And SIL is TA for this: ""then she began accusing me of being condescending and passive aggressive."" SIL is fed up of you being in her home, sorry dude."
clgsxj,"NTA in my opinion. Your room, your stuff, your rules."
clh3xs,NTA. You've plenty of valid reasons to not go.
clh5y1,"NTA,

Love how his intimidation tactic failed"
clh7we,NTA It is completely up to you who you want to be friends with on Facebook
clha5t,"NTA

What she did is so morally reprehensible. She's lying to you, and all of the blame and Punishment would be on You, Without You realizing you're doing anything wrong. Plenty of seventeen-year-olds look 22 and plenty of 22 year olds look 17.

I would be infuriated if I were you."
clhbsk,"NTA, its completely up to you to choose who you want to be friends with"
clhcfy,"YTA, tell your mom now, not later, youre purposefully planning it out for the vacation."
clhdgo,"I mean as a previous nanny I'm going to go with YTA because in 2019 these kind of decisions are a text away. If a kid won't eat lunch and i'm worried they're going to go hungry, I'd text mom or dad and ask if I should give into the cookie thing. But for the most part, I'll sit a kid in time out first and wait for the tantrum to pass before I reintroduce the lunch. 

I'm giving my perspective because I don't think a lot of people have experience in childcare. I have for several years and I don't feed unauthorized snacks. In the 90s I might say NTA because you can't easily get in contact but now its so easy to just check.

Edit: Also would like to add that some people just aren't cut out for childcare. Yeah, you gotta deal with some tantrums. Yeah, i've had to make kids between sitting at the table and eating or going into time out. It's super annoying, but kids are going to be annoying. If you give into their annoying behavior, it falls back on the parents to have to correct this. Now he thinks tantrum=cookies and it's going to be  frustrating. The idea of childcare is to make parents lives easier and that's kind of the expectation... But it's not for everyone. Not everyone can straddle the balance between care and discipline and walk away leaving happy parents. But it's not unreasonable for your parents to let you go if they're not happy with your care."
clholl,"NTA, but you need a new job. Start looking before you rage quit this one."
clhtcs,"No judgement, just advice:  Don't move in with your brother."
clhwll,ESH you could have asked his mother to take her child away instead of snapping but the kid sounds like a bit of an asshole and his mother could have been paying more attention to her child.
clhyie,"NTA. You needed support during a tough time, yeah maybe you drained her a bit but she went absolutely too far with looking through your journal AND sharing it with others."
cli369,"NTA - they sound like terrible people to be around.  Also, getting Chinese food seems contrary to the whole point of camping.  Pop off, sir.  Or leave and find something more enjoyable to do (if that's an option!)"
cli5dq,NTA. I always hate seeing posts like that (one of my pet peeves with Facebook and a reason why I sparingly check it). I'd tell him and maybe search for an online article about the phenomenon to help back up the claim just in case.
cli81f,"NAH, it’s unfortunate but that’s business. if they rely on you that much, they should have compensated you better."
cli8la,"You are 100% NTA for being annoyed that he is refusing to seek a doctor for treatment. You’d be the asshole if you just got mad for something he couldn’t control but if he’s blatantly choosing to not doing anything about it? Yeah, I would’ve been pissed a lot time ago. 

It sounds like he either has a chronic condition or perhaps a really terrible diet. Does he have a fear of doctors? You may need to support him or get a third party like a counselor involved instead of angrily forcing him to go."
cli9tg,YTA - Your brother can’t express his opinion or disagree with the older brother because he “looks white”?
clidsy,"NTA. If it’s a family tradition and its important to you, go. He can’t be mad that you’re going if he chooses not to go. What a sour puss. 

I think about it this way. 20 years from now, do you want to look back and feel bad for depriving your son because of your boyfriend, or do you want to look back and see how you went to Disney with your son and had a great time and your boyfriend chose not to go? Which is the bigger problem here?"
clikoa,"NAH, but I do have a slight feeling that you’re a bit of the a for referring to a 3 year relationship as having not been “together too long.” Maybe your previous relationship was longer, but three years is fairly significant imo.

I understand your position, I remain friendly and/or friends with several past partners. They were people that occupied huge spaces in my life, and it’s nice to be able to check in on each other occasionally. 

I also understand your partners position, especially so since you seem to categorize this relatively long relationship as something new and untested. She’s probably pretty justified in her insecurities here. 

I think it’s important to prioritize your new partner. Does this biannual check in real mean enough to you that it’s worth hurting your current partner? That’s something I think you should really examine."
cliph8,Thats not an assholeish thing. Thats a perfectly reasonable thing to ask. Thats why i work. Money. Nothing more. There is nothing wrong with that. NTA
clirmz,"YTA - sounds like your current wife has been very accommodating through all the legal issues, the least you could do is be on her side."
clisph,NTA. You’re going after the well-being of her children who need a voice.
clisqt,"NTA - she scolded you for having sex in your own bedroom in your own house, while she was staying for free as a guest? Oh hell no."
cliw7x,"NAH. You decide which relationships you value on your own terms, you're not obligated to be anyone's anything. 

But at this point? Just full ghost or tell him clearly that you don't want to be friends.   
It's not a matter of ""dumb"" but that different people communicate differently and interpret things differently. For example, a person may see someone they know looking at the time to see if they can leave yet and rarely hanging out, often making excuses not to, possibly not talking much about their personal life, and think ""This person may have depression I should keep contact with them and keep inviting them out so they're not too isolated"" instead of ""man this guy super wants me to fuck off"""
cliwsx,NTA. Your education is more important that a vacation. Let them be angry. Hopefully they'll take your priorities seriously in future.
cliwv8,"NTA

In these circumstances, you should not have paid any tip. My understanding, as a Brit, is that you are never legally obliged to pay a tip. Because of minimum wage, you’re not morally obliged either, though it’s always worth recognising friendly service (as I’m sure you do). 

Personally, I’m reluctant whenever it’s automatically put on the bill. Even then, there’s no obligation to pay it. Those are often the places that deserve it least.

Also, it’s best to tip in cash as there are rules about who this can go to. The management are more likely to pocket the money if paid by card."
cliyqj,"NTA

> He brought up how ridiculous I was being multiple times on the walk home

Yeeaah, you are being ridiculous, totally not the guy walking through the dark with a police scanner on speaker."
cliyzq,"NTA, but do not put yourself into that position.  The cops will not be able to protect you, and painting a target on yourself for unstable people is a good way to get bad things to happen to you.    A guy soliciting nudes from a minor is unlikely to even get a day in jail even if they prove with 100% certainty it's him, and most the time they can't even do that.  While 9/10 of these dudes are probably harmless, there's a subset that are totally unstable and you don't want that kind thing in your life."
clizu2,"NTA. Those go near your eye. 

Proper flossing should do the trick, if not he needs one of those flossing swords, not tweezers."
clj0pi,"NTA. 

You know how he'll act, so plan for it appropriately. Talk to your parents first. Brother is not treating the birds well (list things he does and how they're harmful. Have sources available for extra points) and does not participate in caring for the birds. You don't think he's a responsible enough pet owner, and would like to buy the bird back off him. You anticipate him being upset so would like their backup."
clj30r,"YTA. 

If there's so much at stake, stop fucking smoking in the house. It's seriously not that fucking hard. 

**Don't put a six year old in the awkward position of keeping adult secrets in the first place** and certainly do not punish her for it by not getting her a birthday present that's extremely childish, overdramatic, and it's gotta hit you hard once that bday drama unleashes."
clj4wc,Some people don’t get the hint unless you give a reason. Stupid but true.
clj4yd,its impossible to make everyone happy. You are trying to balance and keep everyone’s needs in mind and that’s pretty much the most you can. Your family can either appreciate what you’re doing or they can be upset about something. But you’re NTA
clj5jv,"YTA and

Why wouldnt you be the asshole. Shes in charge of children on heavy pain killers ofcourse you have to report that.

Edit - word"
clj8p5,"YTA

Imagine making life choices like this and not talking about it with the person you spend your life with."
cljaoz,"NTA. 

It's not as if the seller (or the rest of the market) is going to wait for your friend to get their issues sorted out. You're not ""stealing"" the house because it simply isn't hers. If anything, it'd be kind of an asshole move for your friend to want you to miss out on the home you also love when your friend can't have it anyway - a spiteful move imo. 

That said, you *must* talk to her before you proceed - something along the lines of, ""I love the house and I'd like to make an offer for it - but if you're just a week or two away from doing so yourself, I won't; what are your plans?""

Hopefully you'll find that your friend is happy for you to buy it if she can't right now."
cljc9n,NAH. I think it would be nice of you to let your brother watch those things but I dont think you should be obliged to. Your parents sounds crazy.
cljctp,YTA. Baby proof your apartment. You never take a shit alone? That’s insane. There’s absolutely no feasible way to have eyeballs on your toddler every waking moment.
cljdfm,NTA. Don’t negotiate. “I don’t have vacation time and I can’t afford to travel. You’re welcome to come here.” Repeat as necessary.
cljhbu,"YTA. It's none of your business why O said no to you and yes to someone else, though it's pretty clear that your friend's friend was the problem. O is just trying to enjoy their damn birthday, not be involved in a bunch of drama. Also, who begs around to be invited to someone's birthday party?"
cljjeh,"NAH

I am bartender and being caught with someone underage can lead to pretty hefty fines.  You also mentioned that her getting caught can lead to issues woth the program she is seeking or the loss of her job.  

She is not the ahole because she is just a young kid who doesn't realize this mistake could affect her future.  

The only way i think you messed up is by not talking to her.  I would have said hello and be like what are you doing here? Then i would have pulled her aside and kinda just guve her a heads up that getting caught could affect her job or admission into her dream program."
cljkh7,"YTA, and tbh this seems like a shitpost."
cljmh8,NAH.  You're an adult and can choose for yourself.  Also Facebook can link people based on their phone number as I recall.
cljoqg,"NTA. Ella had no business spreading the news. You were already gonna do it; sounds like she was just salty about something tbh. 

Also I’m curious: what’s the difference between a casual and a part timer?"
cljsds,"NTA. You are focused on being right rather than being nice, and she's wanting a different answer than she knows you'll give. Why are you going with her? There is no winning here for you. Break the cycle already.

Edited judgment. Mom is forcing OP to go, probably so she can lure her into this kind of fight. Good luck, OP. Mom sounds controlling AF."
cljtlb,"NTA. You're not obliged to look after their children at all, so the fact that you're willing to accommodate one is great. And your compromise is a good one, especially as, by the sounds of it, your stepdaughter would rather stay with her bio grandparents than with you.

>My son and his wife want to go on a vacation very far abroad...They asked me if I would or could pay for the kids food as well, because...they are currently stretched thin with cars, mortgage, etc. They spend very wisely 

I'm not convinced they do spend very wisely. If they can't afford to feed their children, they shouldn't be spending money on a vacation abroad. They'd be better off having a more affordable, local vacation so they can bring their kids and pay for their food."
cljudy,"NTA, and she definitely is for asking you to throw the competition. If this were for some $10 teddy bear, it’d be meh, she can ask if she wants. But if the prizes are actually worth something, I can’t believe she had the audacity to make up some story to better her chances (actually I can, but I might be jaded).

You go and give that competition your all, and I’m just petty enough that I hope you win and give her a smug smile."
cljyzj,"NTA- Your ""friend"" is a dick. Drop her & him & don't look back. You deserve better friends."
clk1yc,"NTA.

The magical appearance of a grandchild isn't going to make her any less toxic. This is your family, and she's made it obvious that she doesn't accept you or your partner, what makes you think she's going to respect you as parents?"
clk37k,"NTA

Maybe they need to learn some lessons about respect as well, starting with not ridiculing a person's appearance. Whether they were intending to hurt your feelings isn't relevant. If respect is important to them, they should be aware that making comments like that is downright rude. You could have done plenty worse than leave the room. That's a calm, sensible reaction in my eyes."
clk64r,"NTA. She ignored you when you really needed help. Tell her why then give her the cold shoulder. 

FYI, if you’re needing a reference and the person hasn’t submitted their letter 2-3 weeks before the deadline, it isn’t a bad idea to ask someone else. In the worst case, you end up with one more letter than required. 

If I’m applying for a job that needs 2 references, I’ll ask 3 people just in case."
clk6g7,NTA. May be helpful for them to know in case they don’t realize how it comes across.
clk7wh,"ESH. If she literally said that she was doing it because you weren’t fun to be around, then that’s an asshole move. Otherwise, it was just very poor judgement

But yeah, calling her a “dumb cunt” is extremely over the top. Many people haven’t had to deal with loss and don’t know how to help."
clk8tc,"ESH
You’re allowed to be annoyed that he’s so high he can’t properly interact with people. But he’s also allowed to be concerned about his dog. Seeing as the dog was agitated when you left and has known anxiety issues, he’s perfectly reasonable in watching the pet cam continuously when he sees that the dog is having issues. And you definitely could have phrased that comment about not being at the party better, I can see what that would irritate him.

Dogs are a lot of work, but that doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to go and live your life.  And if your bf wanted you to come home with him, he needs to say so."
clkb6p,[deleted]
clkcel,"NTA your parents fucking suck, I hope there’s another adult in your life either another family member (grandparent uncle aunt sibling), teacher neighbor scoutmaster or anyone else you can trust to help you through this. Also be careful what you post online it can come to bite you in the ass, find an adult and talk to them in person don’t rant online about it"
clke3d,"YTA. For someone who is so extensively travelled, you should know better than to stereotype like this.  Keep in mind that there are likely many American tourists that you haven’t noticed when you’ve been traveling because they haven’t made a loud spectacle of themselves.  I think you’ve got a confirmation bias thing going on here."
clkek0,"ESH

She may have been an attention whore, but you surely were an asshole by dignifying her insecurities with any remark at all."
clkjsw,NTA men can have Instagram butts too
clklyr,[deleted]
clkm7l,">I've never seen gay people in real life

You probably have, you just didn't realize, lol.

NAH but try not to staaaare. There's plenty of videos online to watch if you wanna stare at gay guys bein' gay, if y'know what I'm sayin'."

clkoks,"NTA. It was a comeback, you didn’t start it. And it was funny."
clkq3j,[deleted]
clkr87,Why didn't you just call/text him yourself on Tuesday and let him know you won't be attending? Kinda YTA for being a flake
clkumu,"NTA. Guy is going to kill someone. Would be bad enough if it was him and his passengers, even worse if he hits some family with their kids because of his own stupidity.

Do it. You might save a life. Fuck people like him."
clkw7k,"I understand, but this is not healthy behavior and if there’s no consequence and no intervention it could get worse. Good luck."
clkxod,NTA. But it sounds like the smartest thing you can do is just not get a license until you're out of their house. No point in having one if it makes you into a slave that pays for the right to labor.
clkzaf,"I know you didn’t have bad intentions, but YTA. It is just not a good “joke”, especially with kids you do not know within ear shot."
clkzr4,"NTA

I've gone to parties where someone my friend knew I dislike was there and it just made the whole experience shitty especially having to socialize with them."
cll1o5,"NTA - asking about the food is totally normal, especially if you’re bringing a kid. You have no idea what food, how much of it or if there even is any to begin with. 

Just don’t let your kid eat four feet of the six foot sub they get."
cll53o,"Gentle YTA. He was telling you, it just took longer than you liked. Sounds as if you are working toward making this into a thing. A simple “hey, this is a pretty big decision, thought you’d want to talk about it with me earlier. How’s it going?” Best wishes."
cll7o4,NTA get new friends
cll869,NAH but can't you talk to her before you talk to HR?  You've shared a cubicle for five fuckin years and you can't be like hey girl that noise is killin me?
cll87e,Nta
cllefm,"NTA.

Oh boy OP. He is waving a giant red flag, please don't ignore it or for the rest of your life when Mommy makes things easier, Mommy will get her way."
cllklh,"NAH.

Holiday is meant to be spent, and it s meant to be spent doing something you dont do on a daily basis.

If you 2 are really good friends and he wants to spend the day with you he wont resent taking a holiday day for it unless he already has plans for all his holiday days and considers them more important than this event.

Either way, as long as you were polite, you're in a NAH situation.."
clllg0,YWBTA. That's pretty entitled. They gave you your money back. It's not their fault that you have a full night scheduled.

clln9f,"NTA

You're already helping out. As long as your friend doesn't wreck the truck they have nothing to worry about, and by not putting your name down you don't have anything to worry about."
cllno9,NTA. Maybe pass it on to a friend who can appreciate a good foreign meal. It was definitely not rude of you to accept this gesture and your wife is quite the militant vegan.
cllppj,"NTA

If you can train him to be safe around others then that is obviously preferable to putting a healthy dog down. But you clearly need to be even more cautious than you already are being, because if this happens again you could find yourself having the decision to put him down taken out of your hands.

It also sounds like you could do with more support here; I know it is probably expensive but it would be worth getting a professional dog trainer involved, for the safety of others and for your dog.."
cllr5l,"YTA

But not for the reason your dad gave. I agree it is now your car, you paid for it, but if you are getting your step mom's car for free (and assuming that her car is worth more than $300) then it would be a dick move to sell your car/ask your dad for money for it.

The alternative your dad and step mom have of course is that they could give her car to her kid, and then you'd be shit out of luck without a working car for yourself."
cllr9l,"Mmmmm moderate YTA here. You hit him with a triple whammy: you lied about your ex, you declined a second date after sleeping with him once, and you insulted his sexual proficiency and relationship history. 

I don’t see you getting a lot of positive points in here."
cllsvt,YTA- you got some control issues. Of course people should pull their weight but if your a bitch about it don’t except things to get done
clltca,"YTA

You *could* play later, you just don't want to. So you're selfish.

Are your exams at 7am? Perhaps practising later in the day, to hone your later-in-the-day focus, could actually help you for taking the exam."

clm1s5,"You are NTA

Unvaccinated child. Hostility when offered financial assistance. 14+ hours on the road sacrificing two days of productivity. Alarm bells are just all over the place.

About you being an absentee aunt. Try again when he/she is older and with a healthier immune system. There are other ways to make up for it."
clm1zr,"NTA. You weren’t harping in him unnecessarily and were patient for three months. He could’ve communicated not having the time or will to do it, and telling you to fuck off after your reasonably message makes him the asshole."
clm37r,NAH. He's looking out for your kid's safety and you're looking out for all the children's wellbeing. I think it's time to get someone else involved because that girl is not in a stable home at all. She needs a counselor or a case worker or something.
clm5dj,NTA. She did you a big favor blocking you .  She sounds so boring and uptight
clm6mf,YTA. Grow up and tell someone when you're not interested.
clmadv,"YTA. I started out with ESH, but you are kind of ruining your wife's chances at making friends. Yes, you both did agree to those terms (even if they do seem a little controlling), but at the end of the day, she is telling you about him, isn't hiding anything - which is a good sign.

If it will help her mental health, and she enjoys her time more, I'd renegotiate the terms."

clmh38,YTA. That was none of your business. They are broken up and both parties can do whatever they want. She does not have to be loyal to him anymore. He probably doesn't want to know who she's fucking. I think you just hurt all 3 people involved and created drama.

clmji7,"NAH I totally understand your feelings but the working world can be a hard place and if you get a good opportunity, it's stupid to pass it up. Considering how things seem to be managed at that company (i.e. poorly), it's not altogether surprising he might be highly promoted without realizing he would be. Poorly managed companies have a lot of turnover. I wouldn't blame you for backing away from the friendship if you can't move on from the hurt feelings, but he did his due diligence in checking in with you beforehand and since you don't have the inside scoop about his promotion there's nothing to indicate for sure that he knew he'd be up for it."

It’s your mom dude. $26 is $26, she’s right. She said she’s gonna pay you back in cash, so what’s so hard about using the cash to buy another Visa Giftcard?

clmnck,"YTA if you try to stop them from dating. Talk to Anna instead of betraying her trust by talking shit behind her back. Tell her Chris’ position and how you’d appreciate if she’ll be candid about what she is going through with Chris. You don’t know how things will change if they start dating. It’s not like she’s some awful scumbag. You will lose two friends if you start trying to control their actions. You have no evidence she will string him along or hurt him, and if you tell him that, it will be a huge betrayal of trust to both of your friends. Step. Back."

No one wants to hear that from the person they love, even if it's technically true."

clmx20,"ESH. she obviously has some deeper reasons for missing home that you arent looking at, but she sucks for not understanding/ caring about the stress she is asking you to take on. You guys need to talk this through more and find a compromise."

> She then said the only reason she hasn’t is because I’m great with customers, constantly get positive reviews, and I’m the fastest with stock.

""The only reason i'm not firing you is because you are the best goddamn employee i've ever had!""

Might wanna reconsider that job if you are being treated like that."
clmyp7,"I would recommend that you stop making those jokes. Your friend may be laughing along so far, but it's so easy to misjudge it and say something that hurts her. You would be TA (YTA)."

cln2vk,"NTA, your wedding, you have no obligation to serve any specific food.  Plan a meal you’ll love.  If you don’t refer to it as a “vegetarian wedding” most people probably won’t even notice or think about it."
cln36p,"NAH, this might not exactly have been tactful. A bit of foot in mouth disease, but I don't know if it's ""never talk to him again,"" bad. You were goofing around and said something that he didn't want said, but that wasn't exactly the world's most offensive or off-putting thing. Maybe put a tiny bit more thought into the things you say, but really not that big of a deal."
cln3a6,"YTA r/gatekeeping

Edit to add: one of the definitions of nationality is ""a group of people of the same race, religion, traditions, etc."" 

OP - Good for you for reading through the comments and learning something today :)

Edit 2: YES, I hear what you all are arguing. I, too, know that nationality also means ""the state of belonging to a particular country or being a citizen of a particular nation."" 

TIL Americans are the only ones who accept ""I'm Irish"" or ""I'm Mexican"" to mean culture. I assure you, I don't know anyone who is trying to claim citizenship of these countries. 

Also, stop hating on people for never visiting the country of family origin. Not everyone in America has money to go back to the ""motherland."" Not to mention, there are reasons people come the US that may not make it so appealing to return.... For example, those who have family who sought refugee status. I would never have the heart to tell someone they can no longer identify as Polish because her grandma decided to fuck off during WWII. 

Those who don't speak the language, take a US history lesson. Many immigrants had and continue to have an incredibly difficult time assimilating to this country and maintaining all aspects of their culture. By second or third generation, there aren't many who still speak their family's native tongue. FFS, how many people in Ireland really still speak Irish?

Edit 3, then I'm done. My son's awake: So I can't be proud to be Irish, even if it's in my DNA? Fuck. I better burn all the evidence of my dance lessons. Guess I'll stop going to Irish festivals and get rid of my music. 

For the record, we know we're American. We  acknowledge we wouldn't be here if it weren't for those who came before us. We do this using simple statements like ""I'm Irish"" rather than ""my DNA, a physical piece of who I am, says my great grandmother came from Ireland. I think that's neat. Perhaps I'll take time to know more about this if and when the opportunity presents itself."""
cln5ob,"NAH -  It’s their right to ask, it’s your right to decline."
cln6dk,NTA. You should be able to not follow a religion without your parents forcing you. Ask your mom if she'd rather have a fake catholic kid or a kid who's honest about how they feel..
cln8qy,"It’s not just that it is fashionable. Her parents had custom earrings made specifically for her for her wedding. Her fiancé must know about them, so it is strange that he would ask her about his mom’s earrings instead of another piece of her jewelry. 

OP - I would consider compromising and asking if there is anything else of her’s you can wear instead? Or come up with another way to go or her during the ceremony (favourite poem or a reading that was done at her wedding, empty chair, etc.)"
cln9g8,"You did this to yourself. He’s lazy, and a liar. Get him out of the house."
cln9vg,"NTA. 

You deserve a partner, not a rude, useless, overgrown child."
clnb5g,"YTA.

> I didn't do that for Eid out of spite.    
>  
>  Ideally, I would work that day, Frank would learn it was a holiday later, and I would play the martyr for having worked that day without complaint and score some good-employee points.   
>  
>  So now I feel like I have to take that time off, lest Frank think I was faking Ramadan and lying to him before. Also, I don't want Selwa to know what a lazy ""muslim"" I am. 

You are a liar, a lazy employee, and an asshole."
clnbnf,NTA. Are you the scapegoat and your sister is the golden child?
clne23,"Just popping into ask... Does she not have a baby of her own right now?

Because if she's never birthed a child, this is a moot point. You can't be a surrogate without having a successful pregnancy first. You can inform her of that and avoid this entire disagreement lol"
clngfe,"NAH- you can keep it if you want, but they didn’t do anything wrong by asking to buy it. It’s true, what are you gonna do with it, let it sit in a drawer and have it remind you of your ex?"
clnhq0,"YTA but only because it seems like you want to end the friendship on your terms and not hers.  The line that sticks out is where you said you stopped talking but started up again because you didn’t want her to ghost you.  Why not if you wanted to end the friendship anyways?  If you grow apart, you grow apart.  That happens and it is fine.  I think forcing the end without discussing it with her, makes you a little bit of an asshole."
clnkpu,"NTA.    It’s perfectly understandable that you want to raise well rounded humans, not professional athletes."
clnooo,"NTA your lifelong friend was in a very dangerous situation, and you very well may have saved her life. He’s right in being upset but he should hear you out."
clnp2k,"NTA, it’s a sanitary item, not a sex toy. She shouldn’t be “uncomfortable” with you using tampons if you need to use tampons"
clnq4m,"YTA yes you’re job for the summer involves working with kids. They do and say dumb stuff. You can’t go around banning things cause they annoy you, they’re children. Do something else for the summer with less interaction with kids if you get frustrated so easily by working directly with children."
clnra3,"ESH. Your brother sounds annoying as fuck, but, your ""advice"" to him was mean-spirited (came from a place of bitterness) and honestly not very reflective of reality. That whole myth about how the popular kids are actually dunces who can't survive in the real world is just a myth. Social skills are usually VERY important to career advancement. The only thing that gets you further than charisma is money.

Oh sure there are a few socially inept folks out there who strategically picked up some rare skill and have to get hired because they're the only ones who can do the job, but if super-charisma man also happened to apply for that same job, guess who would be getting it? Not Smeagol."
clns2t,"If I’m reading this right, you mentioned in passing, without judgment or accusation, as one of multiple possibilities, that a baby that had recently started going to daycare might possibly have been a source for an illness a lot of you are contracting?

NTA all the way."
clntas,"NTA. I would say that the biggest problem here isn't necessarily that your husband likes to be generous with his family, but rather that he does so despite this putting the two of you on different pages. You're one household, and you should treat your finances like your shared responsibility. Budgeting is important no matter how large your income. I do agree with you that your brother should establish boundaries with his family, but make your priority getting the two of you on the same team financially.
(Edit for pronoun error)"
clntne,"ESH he's an asshole for his actions but you're an asshole for publicly humiliating him in a group chat. I don't even think recording him is wrong. You talked to him once and it seemed like he needed a come to jesus moment. But you could have said this privately, shown him privately, and I think based on his initial apology he would've been receptive and realized wht a jackass he was. But now he's to embarrassed to even come around. Public shaming is not the way to go"
clnvsf,"YTA - you have no idea what his service entailed.  I am a veteran, and I’ll tell you that if the VA warranted him to have a disability that’s all that matters.  You put all this other information in there to call out how you disapprove of him, but at the end of the day you are making a judgement on someone’s service you weren’t a part of.  As a chaplains assistant they counsel people going through grief and doing really bad shit.  You are a PoS for even thinking of doing this to this guy."
clnwsw,NAH BUT...your mother feels insecure about how your dad is able to take you on a THREE WEEK EUROPE TRIP and you don’t want to humor her for THREE DAYS? Put yourself in your mothers shoes and you’ll understand why she’s upset- she’s hurt!
clnz12,I think you are the least asshole of all the posts I’ve read on here. Go about the rest of your day knowing you e done nothing wrong.
clnzj4,"YWBTA to yourself mainly if you stay friends with someone who puts you down. Don't bother trying to ""teach her a lesson,"" it won't work. Just end the friendship."
clnzs2,NAH. He was willing to share with you and play together. You didn't ask to play alone. Next time just ask politely.
clo02o,"NTA. This suggestion might cause turmoil, but I would reccomend she see a therapist. They dont always work, but if she is that insufferable that you dont want to be around her, proffessional action is probably best."
clo1dn,"I'm not entirely sure this fits in this sub, it would probably be better in a relationship advice sub. You're very obviously NTA in this situation"
clo1eu,"YTA. OP, you said in the comments that you agreed to this in April and told her in June about your vacation. You broke your promise by going on vacation in the period you knew she would be giving birth. It's not like she asked you to be there for a yoga class. She asked you to be there when she's at her most vulnerable, at one of the most intimate moments of her life. You should have made your plans differently, or you shouldn't have promised her in the first place."
clo23f,NAH it sounds like she feels the two of you aren't compatible and that she would like a partner who has interests that match hers more.
clo3dl,"NTA - A no call/no show for an entire week is inexcusable. I sympathize with her, but part of being an adult is still handling your obligations even during tough times. All it would have taken is a quick call or text to prevent all of this, as it sounds like you would have been understanding."
clo3pn,"YTA, there’s a place for that advice but I don’t think it’s right after a breakup like that. He wasn’t looking for that kind of advice, he was looking for your support."
clo73n,"NTA, maybe she could decide when she's a little older if she would like to meet her racist grandfather, but for now you're not TA for keeping him out of her life."
clo9uw,"NTA 

If he expressed to you it was “just lovely” and ran and told his gf otherwise then he’s a fake person. & it’s weird for his gf to confront you over that, she’s clearly got some insecurity issues she needs to figure out if she’s upset over someone drawing a portrait of her bf as a present. Tell her to politely fuck off and ask your roommate about it and see what he says"
clobnt,"ESH, I think, if you hit her with a long list of old grievances. Everything you mentioned seems to be either in the long ago past, or doesn't directly affect you. 

However, if she says or does something
inappropriate on her visit, I think you should address it then and there. Set strong boundaries for her going forward and deal with things in the moment so they don't fester. 

I think you should consider therapy to work out the issues from your childhood."
clobv2,"NAH. If no service was rendered, no tip is required."
cloeoe,"I’m going to say NAH. Your in-laws just want to see you, and you just want to rest."
clofhl,"NTA. Guy walked up to you acting creepy, pushy and confrontational. You did the right thing in telling him to get lost. Engaging further may have actually put you in danger."
cloj6z,NTA - Kid's needs should always come first.
clolrf,"NTA, that's actually a pretty smart way of handling things. You didn't do anything wrong and your brother was being a dick.

side note: Is he a famous vlogger now?"
clomj3,"NTA. It sounds like he wants to be a friend only when it's convenient for him, and he doesn't sound understanding at all. If he doesn't work, why is it all on you to meet up with him, only when he feels like it? You should definitely discuss it with him, but stay calm and collected. The goal isn't to start a fight or make him feel bad, but he should know that he hurt you by not being there for you on a day that was really important to you."
cloo5h,"NTA. You didn't even say anything mean, you were just honest to get him to drop it."
cloov4,NAH but good luck with that! Grandma gonna grandma.
clopg8,NTA OP. The only real asshole is your friend for letting underage girls run about the place.
cloqdg,NTA invite your friends to your place instead ?
cloqpc,"YTA. Everyone paid a bunch of money to travel and celebrate with you for your birthday, expecting them to also pay for your meal was extremely entitled. It’s nice when a group decides to treat the birthday girl but that doesn’t make it cool to expect and demand it."
clort2,"NTA - if a friend doesn't listen to you repeatedly asking her to stop, she's not a friend."
cloumo,Definitely the asshole. Way to lower yourself to bad behavior and then be a pussy about it.
clovmj,"Definitely NTA
Maybe not the wisest move on your part but you didn't cheat on her, you didn't lie and a lot of sex workers (definitely not all) are no dirtier than someone you pick up in a bar for a 1 nighter."
clow9j,"NTA    If that page is making money off your talent and hard work it should be shut down.  Stealing art is not ok.  

What’s the link to your site?"
cloxln,"NTA. Cut contact. If you don’t, you open yourself up to him hurting you more."
cloy6t,"Tricky one as I have fallen into this before... I would say maybe offer your time for free, but grandpa pays for the materials. Your present to grandma is your time.

NTA at all for charging cost of materials etc - frankly NTA for charging well below minimum wage for your time, but I know how it goes with making stuff for family and friends, they will pressure you to charge nothing.

Maybe speak to grandpa and see if he would be willing to pay your price, if he complains say ""ok, I'll take my labour costs off, but the other stuff has to be paid for"" - if he was making them himself he'd have to buy things in, after all. Use that point if anyone complains. Your time spent is your gift, not the whole gift. That's grandpa's gift and he has to buy it."
cloyhr,"YTA. One party is enough. Your friends have lives too. 

I get that they were your support line but is there a chance you've leaned a bit heavily over the year and not been much of a friend back in return? 

Depression sucks (I get it too) but it can also be very draining on those around you and I'd reach out first to your friends before ditching them, especially if they've been there for you in the past."
cloz1n,"NTA- Your income has nothing to do with the rental split. Be wary though, they might start ""coming up short"" each month now. I'd get out quick."
clp06n,NTA. Why would you pay that bill when they were responsible for your dog getting into the poison? Shame on them for trying to act like they weren’t responsible for this.
clp0m9,"ESH

Living together does not mean you spend quality time together."
clp0nk,"Honestly took some hard thought for me, because of my love for dogs/animals gives me a hard bias, but NTA. If your father is fully capable of taking the dog to the vet on his own, then there is honestly not much reason for you to be there. It's hard to take a dog to the vet, but your father is an adult, and you have work."
clp631,NTA. Your friends are being creepy by assuming you're being a creep.
clp9y6,NTA that’s super creative
clpdxp,"ESH. Skipping the annoying part and only doing the fun part is douchey. But Jesus, 3.5 hours? What is that couple thinking?"
clpf6p,"NTA

I was really close to an everyone sucks judgement (since you were a bit rude), but honestly they seem to really pile on you and not listen, so I think your behaviour and upset is justified. And you tried to remove yourself from the situation, which was ultimately the mature thing to do."
clpfnj,NTA It sounds like you have good reason for not wanting him to be in the project and you should follow those feelings. If he can't play well with others then he won't be invited. You should invite the person you want to be involved. Don't compromise your project just to protect someone else's ego.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
clpjq5,"NTA. I’ve always had full control of my bank account because it’s my money, and it doesn’t belong to my parents. Them taking your money is bad enough but if the don’t intend to pay you back that’s horrible. 

You deserve that money back and in my opinion you should have full control over your account."
clpqd9,"NTA- Do whatever the fuck you want, you guys broke up. If she’s going to be petty like that, then maybe it’s good you guys broke up."
clpusk,"NTA, I'm a father of 3 girls so I can understand wanting time to yourself but spending 25% of your off work time golfing is a bit much. Personally my hobbies have shifted from me things to stuff that I can invole my family in, I went from hunting to home theater and Christmas lights"
clpwtn,NTA I mean... does she really wanna see you jerk off again? But I wouldn't do this all night long. It's her house and it's a safety risk so doing it for 8 hours is excessive. I would certainly put a door there for jerk off times though.
clpypg,"NTA but you do need to grow a spine on this one, my sister. You called HIM to apologize after he threw two things during one visit? He's an abusive asshole. Please ""be alone"" from him forever. If you do not, I guarantee this will escalate. How long have oyu even been together? 

It's throwing things first. It's throwing you second. Please leave."
clpyug,"NTA I'm not familiar with Florida laws but where I am, this is illegal. Landlords need to give 24 hour warning before entering your home. And if she was this picky about electricity she shouldn't have included it in rent! She could have done a separate utility charge but coming into your home to save money is unacceptable. You pay rent, you can run the AC and fan all damn day if you so please. 

Look up the local laws about landlords entering then make that law very clear to her as well as the fact that she's no longer welcome to come in and turn off anything. This is such an invasion of privacy."
clpyun,"NTA 

I don’t think you’re being crazy. His shit did not go as advertised. House parties and camping are very different.. it’s like some bait and switch bullshit, and posting girls that aren’t his girlfriend to social media is.. what, why would he do that? 

So he’s advertising and showing off the party on social media, that he went to without his girlfriend, and was taking pictures of girls and posting them. Like.. he’s acting pretty single."
clpzrq,YTA. You two had an agreement and you saw the message from your father so you should have said something.
clq19y,"This seems bigger than AITA honestly. It's a complicated topic and it doesn't seem that sports has really caught up to figure this out. 

Do what you gotta do and athletes will have to keep discussing and figuring it out as you go along."
clq1ve,"NTA. It may have been a little close, since it was only three days later, but this had been something she didn’t seem to be interested in until that night when she made it seem like she was, then nothing happened. I’m not saying her showing interest meant anything had to happen, but she didn’t want to do anything, which is an indication that you should move on. Which you did and now you’re apparently an asshole, which isn’t true"
clq3dl,"NTA

Employers can fire you at the drop of a hat, you can do the same to employers."
clq8kx,"NTA: as a former pizza delivery guy, I approve. Pizza guy can bitch to themselves or co workers after, but complaining about a 3+ dollar tip to the customer is the wrong move. Good on ya for getting your change back."
clq90w,NAH but try to re-home her over taking her back to shelter if you can. A cat may be a better investment for you. Fellow depressioner here and cats have helped me without feeling needy.
clq9oj,"NTA. You were off participating in the race, doing your job as a teammate. They should have done their jobs as teammates and protected your stuff. 

Would they have been pissed at you if you quit racing to come move your stuff?"
clqa3m,"This is more for r/relationships or r/relationship_advice.

If you want to improve things, then you should attend big events. It's a 50th birthday, that's a milestone. 

But your overdose does suggest issues beyond just your in-laws. And you need therapy for that."

Its not you crashing into a child. Its your gf who is crashing into a child. So be a decent human and dont let two humans crash into each other."
clqbz0,NTA. They gambled and lost end of story
clqcio,"NAH. My husband did the same to me. So I realized how straight up dumb it was. I downloaded an app for kids to learn basic geography. Now I know where more countries are than he does! Learning and realizing the need to learn things is so important.

Edit: I'm so glad so many people wanted the app! I use StudyGe."
clqd4h,NTA- it’s her car she should drive her new car if she wants to drive
clqdsb,[deleted]
clqeoj,"ESH. It was the actions of a 3 year old. Your cousin should have reprimanded her and apologized to you, but you didn’t need to scream at him."
clqiev,"NTA.

>Our friend group, including him and boyfriend, agreed that he dodged a bullet

In the end, it was Jace's decision to end the relationship. If everyone (including your cousin's parents) knew she was hitting on your boyfriend, I think it's fair game to talk about it and warn people."
clqkvb,"NTA  
As of now, you shouldn't do any favors for them, you don't help them out, you don't watch the rabbit, you don't do their dishes, take out their trash, nothing.   
You aren't their live-in helper when they need it and your schedule doesn't need to be adjusted for them at all.  
  
They will cry about it, beg you to do a favor for them, etc. Just say ""Sorry, can't do that, I have plans"" even if your plans are to hang out at the house and watch a movie, they are your plans."
clqn6g,"NTA 

Do what’s best for you."
clqn6w,"Sounds like an AH, but while his attitude is terrible and might lack serious social skills, his approach to move up seems to be correct. He clearly wants to move up at this job and there's nothing wrong with being ambitious. He wants documentation because it will be in writing and if he improves on those exact things then technically you can't argue that he doesn't deserve said promotion which is the correct approach. If I wanted a promotion I would rather have that then some vague non committal response from you and hope you pick me the next time an opportunity comes up, which lets be honest would be never in his case. It kind of sounds like you guys are stone walling him on everything. He wants to stack his days off ""Oh it's never been done before"" so what, is that a crime? I've seen too many office situations where better and more progressive ideas get shot down just because ""We've always done things this way, and we don't like change"". 

I'm not saying all his ideas are amazing etc, he definitely sounds like an arguer and not in a good way. Honestly I would lean towards NAH but say you are doing yourself a disservice by not jumping on this opportunity. Worse case is if he doesn't listen but he is asking for documentation, what is the issue? Obviously point out the exact things you mentioned here. He isn't a team player, does not follow protocol without arguing, lack of compliance to directives from upper management etc. That is the truth and the onus is on him to improve that. If he disagrees or doesn't change well... There it is in writing, that's why he won't get the job, duh!

From personal experience I've seen someone get turned down for a promotion for that exact reason. Always questions instructions doesn't listen always thinks they are right. Surprise surprise no promotion and he eventually quit because he was frustrated he was stuck in a dead end here which is true because he couldn't follow instructions to save his life"
clqo5e,"NAH, except for your parents, obviously. Keep in mind that everything you're doing from this point on is for your sister, not your parents. How you two treat each other at this extremely difficult time will set the tone for your relationship going forward."
clqqys,"NTA

Truth hurts sometimes but she needs to hear it. If she's dead set on having the baby, at least talk to her about adoption options before considering contacting family services. Good luck op"
clqvnb,NTA. I’m so sorry you were put in an untenable position.
clqxzs,"NTA, but I do think this belongs to r/legaladvice just in case anything happens and you gotta protect yourself."
clqy80,"YTA

LMAO all this over smoking pot? Are you SERIOUS.

How many people smoke cigarettes and drink in these said families?"
clqzjl,NTA. It sucks that’s she’s got that shit going on but you’re not her therapist.
clr14q,"This seems like a miscommunication - you offered his spot, and it sounds like she took you up on it. But, because you brought it up, she didn’t think she needed to confirm, whereas you thought the issue was resolved. 

NAH, for that reason. Try not to get too upset about this; she sounds relatively reasonable and as if she really wants you to be there."
clr1jq,[deleted]
clr9qt,"Oh no! 5 years for college? The horror.

YTA. If your sister does not want to carry a baby to term, it none of your business. You have such a negative perspective on her (marrying her ex?!) that why would she want you to raise her child with those views."
clrats,"YTA. All pots, pans, and knives are hand wash only in my house. I also have a mall fortune invested in mine, so there is that....."
clratt,"NTA. I don’t blame your parents for being worried about your sister, but if it’s inconveniencing you and the public (not to mention disrespecting the local culture) then your parents are TAs."
clrgof,NTA: Guys like that are scum. Predators. If your g-ma is disabled you got to look after her.
clrht6,"NTA, she had no right to be so exceedingly rude especially if the situation went exactly as mentioned. She insulted you in your own home over what seemed to literally be--at the most basic level--you looking out for her son. Dont worry about what everyone is thinking, IMO you made the right move, the last thing you guys need right now is senseless drama. Just keep caring for your husband and family as best you can. Hope all goes well and he gets better!"
clrj27,NTA. Let one of those relatives who feels so much empathy for him take him in.
clrj3f,Nah. Sleep under different blankets.
clrkmc,NTA. Your mom has clearly not processed her grief in a way that has enabled her to accept your brother’s death. It should not follow that she marginalizes your life as a result.
clrlfb,"Can you explain why anyone would be offended by braids? I’m also not sure if the significance of you being from Mexico..... is there some kind of braids and Mexico thing I don’t know about?

Right now it totally seems like a non issue NTA"
clrlz6,"NTA

You specified boundaries and he keeps being a prick with how he plays. He might've learned a lesson with that."
clrmed,"NAH- Neither of you are being assholes, but seriously, its 4 months away, he doesnt know if he'll be available."
clrmuv,"NTA. One possible way around this is to get a Google Voice number and have it routed directly to your email. Then he can stop asking, but you have a safety net up for the volume and frequency of his attempts to communicate."
clroc4,"NAH- you can't be upset with you're dad if you didn't communicate that you want it to just be the two if you and why. Go ahead and tell your dad how much this bonding experience means to you, don't badmouth the rest of your family in the process though, just focus on why bonding with him means so much to you. Maybe you can even suggest something afterwards that you can all do together as a family."
clrq51,"NAH. However before you announce your decision to your father you'd be wise to consider a few things. For one, as you know, your father will react poorly to your rejecting the business. As he has spent much of his life's energy and time in this work, I'm sure a large portion of his identity is tied up in this. He may interpret your rejection of the family business as you rejecting him or being unimpressed by his hard work. I think it could be a more painful blow for him than just his heart being broken at the loss of his dream. 

Are you an only sibling or is there perhaps a younger brother or sister who would love to take your place? Perhaps, even though you are the chosen one to take over, a sibling or even a cousin would love the opportunity. It would be a shame to allow a flourishing and long-standing establishment to disappear because it doesn't fit with your plans to pursue other passions. 

This is a tough one. Best of luck."
clrt4q,"NTA - As you pointed out, this scholarship is merit-based, not economic-based. If you had lied about your financial circumstances, you would most definitely be TA. In these circumstances, however, you did what was sound for your uni and future career. Juan, on the other hand, should harvest his crop of sour grapes and leave you be. He’s TA."
clry5v,"Original question: Did you sign a lease?

Based on your answer I am going to say NAH, but prepared for the dude you applied with to be upset."
clryvz,"YTA if you said it that way. You can ask politely. You can move. Having someone die in your life is very very hard and I’m sorry for your loss, but it doesn’t allow you to be a jerk to people around you. If you have to travel on trains that often, get earplugs to drown out the sound."
cls0im,"NTA, kid has better manners than the MIL"
cls3fn,NTA. You made an honest effort to pay and it wasn’t doable. Just tip nicely and pay if they ask at the end.
cls5lh,NTA. The truth is the truth.
cls6ag,"YTA. I would have said no AH here, but 

>she got mad at me because I was a little cold to her when waking her up so I told her I couldn’t help but feel upset that every time we hangout she ends up falling asleep and we can’t ever have sex or even just sit up and chat. 

If your girlfriend is so tired that she's falling asleep right away, waking her up is a dick move, ESPECIALLY if you're waking her up to lodge a complaint. 

Your schedules don't line up. Yes, that sucks, and I'm sure if you guys have a rational adult conversation you'll be able to find a solution to it. It might mean that you guys have to talk on your dates, or forgo actually going out to stay home and cuddle and have sex, but typically, sleep is a non-negotiable need for people. Let her have that."
cls6ip,"NTA obviously.  To some degree this is just how apartment life goes, but sounds like she's being inconsiderate."
cls6iu,"NTA, but also not the smartest move. 

Don’t burn bridges if they do t need to be burnt. Expect nothing of her or from her. Decide what kind of relationship you want with her, then pursue that end. If you don’t want a relationship, fine, let it drift into obscurity. She isn’t a boyfriend, no need to break up."
cls79i,"YTA. 

You basically made them buy it for you."
clsb1g,"NTA. Your sister did NOT have the right to tell her daughter to go through your things beyond what you had allowed, she did NOT have the right to just grab whatever she felt like and appropriate it for her son, she did NOT have the right to be so horrifically cruel and defensive when you called her out, and she did NOT have the right to dictate how you’re allowed to feel.

Both your sister AND your niece owe you an apology. I was divided on your niece until I saw her age; at 14 she should have known better or at least apologized for herself."
clsccm,"YTA: I'm not sure there's a correct answer here. You're preventing her from doing something she really enjoyed, and was willing to take a risk to keep doing, and something that your friend was obviously really into as well.

On the flip side, her parents seem over bearing, and could ground her or whatever for a while, which has the same effect. 

Ultimately, I don't think there's a correct answer here, but the way you did it is wrong. Hell, you could of had your DM to try to do a party wipe or something.

The path to hell is paved with the best intentions. It's not really your call to make... It's hers. There were better ways to do it.

Edit: I talked myself into the YTA for doing it the way you did it."
clsewz,"Edit: NTA

Why is everyone mad at a scared 16 year old for doing a bad job of parenting a stranger's kid while under pressure?? It wasn't her kid. So of course she has no experience about productive child conflict resolution. 

Obviously, in an ideal world, the child didn't get cursed out. Tough luck. If the mom won't teach her, it's time she learned to respect instructions about a stranger's pet. YeLlInG at KiDs is BaD. Oh Jesus, how were any of you raised? Just soft whispers of please don't do that sweetie, you're making mommy sad. It's not her choice in parenting style, it was a crisis mode mistake. 

And obviously the saftey of her blind sister and doggo are way more important than some kid wanting to pet the doggy. Heck, you mess with my dog period and I'm calling your kid out."
clsfw3,"NTA

I drive separate to all events. Depending on the event even my husband and I will drive separately. I just don’t like being tied down. And sometimes my husband likes to stay later."
clsgo1,"NAH- You seem sensitive to the fact that he might be offended so I think if you approach this carefully and diplomatically with your BF it might be a good thing. Some guys just aren't aware of such things and as long as you bring it up in a nice way, there is nothing assholish about that"
clshmg,"NTA.

Erin is transphobic. Is there a manager above Erin?"
clsjjd,NTA. Your friend seems like a baby who can’t handle relationships. You need to move on from this friend if he’s acting this immature because I suspect this is not the only time he has acted like a child.
clsmay,"YTA

>I pointed at him so she could see

So...as a preemptive move to keep your children from possibly being rude you just decide to be flat out rude and point at the guy like he's a teaching prop? O.o"
clsopf,"NTA. Not a lawyer, but a bunch of my friends are. School ranking counts A LOT for job prospects. More than many people think. If you have the opportunity to go to a top ranked school, go. Your future salary can cover the loans."
clsql9,"NTA

You told her in advance, and why participate in something that makes you uncomfortable.

If you said you were gonna stay the entire night, then it’d be a different story; but you didn’t."
clsw4o,"YTA. If you’re spending so many holidays with your friends and family, you can’t sacrifice time for your husband to spend time with his father (who’s only available when you want to leave)? 

It’s a bridal shower, surely you’ll still have the wedding to attend. You have your sister and cousins in your area but his whole family is in Colorado. I’m sure he’d like to soak up as much of that as he can and you wanting to cut it short is nothing short of selfish."

clt7k4,"NAH

>My family is telling me to stay here. They know I want to be home, but they keep saying to not worry.

They're looking out for you. Listen to them. If you can't afford to leave, and your post confirmed that, then it is understandable that you can't go."
clt9aq,"YTA or more precisely, you’re the child. You’re acting so immature. You need to act like nothing happened and then learn from this that workplace flirtation can go very wrong"
clt9ju,"ESH 

You shouldn’t have cheated the guy out of money you agreed to pay by way of sending your clothes to him. 

He shouldn’t have left his business unattended for so long you had to just grab them and go."
cltc5h,Totally NTA. It’s not your job to babysit someone. I worked at the local humane society for about a year and we had someone who has the same issues. She is restricted to cleaning out the cat cages with supervision and washing dishes. I understand how difficult your job is and I want to say thank you for helping the animals.
cltcnl,"NTA, it's unfortunate that your roommate's girlfriend's hair got in your food, but neither of you are TA for that. Your roommate, on the other hand, is making a deal out of this when it wasn't your fault.

As a quick note, ""heated debate"" makes me think like there could be more important info in there, but I'm taking this information at face value."
cltcuf,NTA speak up for your wellbeing! You could also ask to talk to your physician privately (you can do this right in front of the doctor if you think your mom would be against this from the get go.... don’t hesitate to fake illness either) and ask about your options. Depending on your age and state’s medical laws you might be able to still receive them. Good luck!
cltelz,"NTA: he went to a kids movie and expected it to be quiet? Not only is he an asshole, he's delusional.  What he said was uncalled for and you handled it pretty tactfully."
cltg7f,NTA. Why does he think its only his heritage you're allowed to consider?
cltg89,"YTA

She wanted it in the family, and you were the best of the potential wives at the time.

What's your plan? 
To pass it down to your future kids saying it was from an EXs grandma you knew for 8% of your life, with no family connection?
Give it back."
cltizw,"NTA. Your home is supposed to be your safe space and somewhere you feel comfortable. If your roommates are talking about you behind your back, that sounds like a somewhat toxic environment. Your comfort should be your priority. I’d suggest talking to them before you make a decision but ultimately you WNBTA for doing what’s best for you."
cltj2k,"Yeah great idea, cos your roommate banging on the door is going to be so easy to sleep through. /s

You need to get yourself another roommate.

cltk43,"ESH, she’s non-committal and selfish, you’re entitled and impulsive. Everybody sucks, get different friends."
cltk9x,"Definitely NTA, tell your brother to stop being a twat, and to have some respect"
cltlbc,NTA. Nothing to say.  It’s a huge deception.
cltmmi,"You’re not the asshole. You’re trying to describe a social phenomenon, not one you subscribe to yourself, you’re just explaining its existence. You’re not wrong about those existing, and I also agree they’re damaging and incorrect."
cltms3,NTA. Do what you have to do to get through school! She also in a sense tore your family apart. You have every right to skip & not go!
cltneh,"NTA - one day, perhaps when she has alienated her son completely, it may be good for your sister that your nephew has someone like you that he is able to talk to and trust without being judged"
cltoam,NTA. Fuck him.
cltq75,"Before the film? YTA. 

You 'technically' have no 'obligation' to speak with them, but it's both rude and socially awkward to shut down a conversation completely in the 10-15  minutes where you're just sitting around and doing nothing important. 

Imo, that's a needlessly assholish move, and THEY definitely think you're an asshole if you responded to their friendly small talk with ""leave me alone"". 

You could have expressed the same sentiment in a more mature and respectful manner. 

During the film? Not the asshole."
clttpo,NTA - Your mother was living vicariously through you... tons of people don’t go to prom and they turn out just fine.
cltvd5,FYI Adderall is way more dangerous and addictive than shrooms
cltviv,"YTA, for two reasons: 

1. By speaking up you were letting him know that you’d been looking over his shoulder at his phone. That’s a pretty rude thing to do. He was only playing a word game, but private messages could have popped up on his screen any time. 

2. Some people like the challenge and *want* to figure things out by themselves. Maybe solving the final word was his goal, not simply moving on to the next level. 

I get that your heart was in the right place, but next time you should bite your tongue."
clty8d,"NAH, you should feel free to try to gather support for anything you believe in in any legal manner.  I doubt you'll get very far tbh, but no assholes here to try."
cltyyf,YTA You sound like a narcissist. That reeks of ego and insecurity. Why would you hope for other people to miserable when their happiness literally costs you nothing?
cltzu2,No matter what it's your cat and responsibility. Cats can hide and it shouldn't be her responsibility to look for and after your cat.
clu3nd,[deleted]
clu715,"YTA, even if you had good intentions. You sat someone down and told them they aren’t funny, they’re too enthusiastic about their interests, and they need to grow up. This isn’t one specific behavior or minor adjustment, you essentially told your friend “your personality sucks.” You can’t come at someone like that with a laundry list of things you/no one likes about them and essentially ask them to be a different person.  That’s an asshole thing to do. If she gets on your nerves so much, spend less time with her."
clu9ou,NTA. Your gf sounds exhausting.
club98,NAH. Doesn’t sound like any major conflict happened; your dad may have very well avoided one by moving tables actually.
clug29,"NTA You don't have to talk about it unless you want to and you feel comfortable discussing it. He's not an AH for wanting to talk/explain but he is an AH for how he reacted to you not wanting to discuss something that was painful for you to experience, he might have reacted like he did because he was desperate and felt guilty, but he should be respecting your boundaries."
clukad,"NTA - it's one thing to ask not to tell anyone, but you covering for her (e.g. by saying she had only left a few minutes ago) would've been sticking your neck out for someone who, for all you knew was out drinking or something during work hours, there was nothing you could really do

Ninja edit: didn't actually read your last couple paragraphs and the fact that she was actually just going to have sex solidifies what I was saying"
clunry,"NTA. If she wasn’t a mother to you, you do not owe her a post or any recognition for work she did not do, time she didn’t put in, etc.

Your brothers ATA for not talking to you and for saying YTA when you’re not."
clunzo,"It's a troll. You didn't ask them to change their birth name, just the screen name.

NTA"
clupdq,"YTA. Your wife was probably expecting you to role model responsible drinking, and doing shots with him is not ideal. My parents always had a rule with us that we could drink - but spirits were a no no as it’s harder to control how drunk you get quickly. Teach your son how to enjoy drinking at pace - his friends will do a good enough job of getting shit faced with him."
clurfi,"ESH. I mean your brother sounds quite disgusting but he’s only a child. 

INFO Have your parents spend any time whatsoever teaching him not to behave this way? Does he have any underlying physical or mental health issues that may be causing his behaviour? Has anyone looked into this?"
clutpm,"NTA because you were doing your job and they were breaking the law. Gave ample warning. Pretty open and shut there. 

Although if you want my personal opinion, it was a dick move, especially because you view yourself as a hypocrite for it, while still doing it anyway. Kids were just trying to relax."
clv2uk,YTA. By staying friends with her you're turning your back in your abused friend for someone who is a piece of shit
clv48q,"NAH you're meant to pick the best team and that's what you did.. husbands butthurt, he'll survive, just dont make any jokes about Mike being cute or anything like that any time soon :D"
clv4pb,"NTA. She told you to leave. The ""I didn't mean it because I never mean it"" argument basically should be ""I didn't mean it because I never mean it when I verbally abuse you.""

If she was upset you left because she wanted you around, she'd be more apologetic, instead of being angry at you. She's upset you left because it makes her look like a bad mom. Which she is."
clv8ho,"NTA - What is with these people? They act like news of a fractured finger is a terminal cancer diagnosis. 

Oh no, I have to keep this cast on for 4 weeks instead of 2. The HORROR!"
clvace,"YTA. You left your dirty dishes for way too long. Cooked at 9pm, bed at 9am, so there goes 12 hours. If you got 8 hours of sleep, then you left them for 20 hours. That's just not awesome roommate behavior."
clvbg4,"NTA. That’s honestly a little insane; do you think she could be jealous of how close you and your friend are? I’m trying to think why on earth somebody would react like that.

Honestly I feel for your friend because it seems he’s stuck in a pretty toxic relationship."
clve3z,"NTA - Only you can decide, as the mother of your child, which adults are good influences for him. You have the right to turn away anyone that you feel might not be a safe or smart decision. I'm sorry your mom hasn't been a positive influence in your life - but if she can't be a positive one for you, it's unlikely she will be for him. Best of luck."
clvg0j,"NTA. 

While ignoring your father might not be exactly helpful or mature, it seems to be your only way to cope right now. 

Your parents are both assholes, though. For getting you and your siblings involved in their fights, for disowning you and loving you only if you agree to their terms & conditions, and don't get me started on your father.

It is never, under NO circumstances, ok to insult your kids. And if it was up to me, there should be an organisation of people who legally slap the sh*t out of physically abusive parents. That is not just asshole behaviour, that's worse than scum.

I'm sorry you have to go through this. I hope you're ok. If you have the energy, try and keep your siblings sane.

Either way, the timing couldn't be better for you to go abroad. Maybe by the time you're back, things will have calmed down."
clvg6l,"NTA. 

If there's not a whole bunch of stories missing, she is just an irrational and spiteful person. I highly recommend going to management again and/or looking for another job.

Seriously, you don't need that kind of toxic behaviour in your life."
clvi2i,"The larger problem is her vacuuming sounds kinda insane, like.. is she ok? Like is this a compulsive behaviour orrrrrr..? Nobody needs to vacuum a tiny strip of hardwood at all hours several times a day.

clvm8l,"NAH. Unless your wife is from a country that doesn’t teach science at all, she should’ve learned about the moon in elementary school."
clvpem,"ESH. Jesus christ, the entire situation sounds like a nightmare for poor K and your bf. You and R have very similar condescending attitudes that you know best and everyone else should bend to your unwanted and unsolicited advice."
clvsy5,"ESH - She sounds super annoying and overbearing, but it also sounds like you were being pretty rude isolating yourself in your room and giving her short answers. It doesn't sound like you made much of an effort with her and are using being introverted as the excuse."
clvuye,"YTA. You're both allowed to hear other people's opinions and thinking she isn't entitled to that just because you don't want him to ""influence"" her is being grossly controlling."
clvv15,"YTA. You're on a public beach, why did you feel morally obligated to wake this guy up and bitch about him snoring? Move your towel away if he's bothering you so much. In a public location, you have no position to stand on here."

clvxh4,"NTA. Flaky “friends” are the worst. If they only have time for you on their terms, time to let them go."
clvzqh,"YTA 
don’t really care about the rules at the center, Its irresponsible to have a dog that doesn’t follow commands off a leash, especially around kids."
clw219,"NTA. I mean, you made the food, you can take it home with you if you want. There's no rules, potluck or otherwise, stating you're obligated to keep food out for an indefinite amount of time."
clwb7z,NTA if instagram is so important to her she should’ve looked up a place the night before. 40 minutes to pick a place is ridiculous
clwief,NTA. Does he literally never do anything that can’t make him money? He doesn’t read? He doesn’t watch TV? He doesn’t hang out with friends? Fellow gamer here - you do you!
clwq95,"NTA, you warned, she didn't listen. Totally her fault."
clwqp7,"NTA to not want to be around shitty kids. Half the time I don't even want to be around well behaved kids. If people don't raise their kids to be tolerable individuals, they can't get mad when nobody wants to be around them."
clwtuo,NTA but why lie?  Just say you can’t make it.
clx03z,"NAH. Why do you care? You don't have to watch her videos if you don't want to but don't get dragged into the whole ""influencers are the worst people"" narrative that Reddit has. 

If you're actively putting her down for trying to be an influencer then you'd be an asshole."
clx1ee,"NTA - The border people are the assholes (your dad is not). I live in Europe and I am embarrassed for you. I hate what our fucking world has become. Making you shave your beard is just racist. 

Take whatever name you want. But DON'T change it because some narrow-minded government employees from other countries looked down at you. Only change it if it's what YOU truly want to do. It's your life."
clx2bp,"YTA* sorry mate but you broke it and chose to replace it with a more expensive model. That’s a bill she was not expecting and will probably put her out especially if she’s just returned from a trip.

To be clear I think you’ve been really nice and generous here and I can sympathise but when you do something like that you need to do it knowing that you might not be repaid anything.

*Edit: changed YWBTA to YTA"
clx30n,"Depending on where you live, this could ruin your life. And 20 years ago, people were not as easily out as today, so even people who are gay might have such a reaction. In some countries, it could get you killed. Don’t trivialize it."
clx62w,"So you gave them a work order, then they tried to do work outside the work order, and you forced them to pay for basically vandalizing your car? 

NTA but also not a Karen. You stood up for yourself when someone was trying to cheat you. I'm proud of you."
clx6s5,NTA. Obviously he's not obligated to do you a favor but telling you he'll do it then putting it off and then eventually flaking completely is fucked up.
clx75z,"NTA, this is a concert and i doubt y'all were the only ones standing. People behind you should've known people would be standing"
clx96s,"YTA, come on, everything needs repairs and maintenance at some point. Would you ask for 50c if they wanted to watch your TV or something? This is no different. Just because it has a charging mechanism built in doesn't mean you should be using it."
clxcm5,NTA. Compassion fatigue is very real and it sounds like you’ve already gone over and above the limits of being an excellent friend.
clxcp1,"NTA, he should be able to know to stop when the person is clearly disinterested."
clxd0z,"NTA 

Age doesn't give you a right to straight up lie like that! Not only was she trying to get a stranger in trouble but had some sort of self rightousnes dickheadary. You fucked up, people fuck up, but you never left your child ever, you did what you could to get him out if a dangerous situation as quickly as possible. You did the right thing,  fuck that lady trying to stress a pregnant lady who has stayed with her child. I hate parents that leave their kids, you didn't, you instantly tried to rectify the situation. Age doesn't give you the right to endanger your stress levels and therefore your unborn child's life in an already horrible situation"
clxddp,Tbh it sounds like there's a lot more to the story. Maybe bf wasn't comfortable dealing with you directly since you're a self described angry depressive. Maybe he reached a breaking point in the relationship and this was an extreme he felt he had to go to. You can't expect everyone to be well enough equipped to deal with people who are super angry and aggressive.
clxflh,"NTA. If They have some invisible disability they need to get a permit. Otherwise, they are taking something that wasn't intended for them, and depriving someone that might actually need it."
clxi1g,"NAH -   
But using his name as a middle name is a lovely compromise. Also, it won't feel like (to the future son) like he has to 'live up to' of feel 'saddled' with a name. Let him be his own man with your brother's name as his middle one."
clxjv1,"NTA, your brother is free to invite you and you're free to decline. Only the abusive family members are TA here, and it's understandable you don't want to meet them."
clxkzs,NTA.  They talk about millennials being easily offended yet get easily offended by something they don’t view in the same light or understand?  Double standards and hypocritical.
clxq6g,"NTA you cannot spend the rest of your life doing what your parents want because it's going to stress out your mother. Surely with this revelation of her high blood pressure she's going to be put on beta blockers, correct? 

If you want to do anything, I would wait to bring this up again until she's on medication for her blood pressure and when she is, she's going to have to deal with the stress of her child growing up. But at that point, her blood pressure will hopefully be under control and it wont be about her health, just about her stress."
clxqww,NTA. I worked in restaurants for a long time and people coming in last minute were the worst.
clxsuh,"I'd have to go with NAH. It's not like you did it to upset her, however she's not ta either...this is one of the reasons it's really hard to stay friends with an ex. Part of her will always care for you, like I'm sure part of you will always care for her. It often makes it really hard to see the other person being flirty or romantic with someone else."
clxtqa,"NTA, they need to control their dogs. This behavior is never acceptable."
clxulx,NTA you’ll delete him and he’ll find someone else to annoy. I’m sure he’s a nice kid but you deleting him will hopefully teach him a little about boundaries.
clxwv1,Are you 12 years old? Either way ESH. Controll you tempers before you give both your parents an anurysm.
clxwws,"NAH. Grief tears people apart and everyone handles it differently. I can understand why they were hurt by you not coming, I can understand why you weren’t able to go. I am so terribly sorry for your loss."
clxztc,"At first I was thinking NTA until you said you wanted him to ""feel small."" Belittling someone based on their job isn't cool.

What you said wasn't necessarily rude but your intent was so YTA."
clxzy3,NTA - Don't dish it out if you can't take it.
cly00l,"NTA she could have said something. Anne asked you, not the other way around."
cly0ea,"NAH

Your boyfriend didn't need to ask for your permission to get his nipples pierced, but you're not mandated to like the way it looks either. 

I think its pretty fucking weird that you're having such a strong reaction to them ngl (they're really not that drastic of a body mod lol) but if your reaction is genuine its probably for the best you broke up. If your whole sex life from this point on is just gonna be you glaring at his nipple piercings it doesn't sound much fun for either of you."
cly0k7,Definitely NTA. Being rude isnt helpful and you did the right thing to put her in her place
cly181,"NTA. You booked a seat, it’s your seat. If it was the other way round you’d be booted out. The older generation are just so entitled on public transport. My dad is in his late 60s and if somebody offers him a seat he declines because he wants that person to be comfortable."
cly1fg,"NTA. You did try to correct the guy and reported him to your boss. They don't care, they just don't. There's not a lot you can do without risking your own job. Once you leave you can report them to authorities, if that applies. If not, then just fill up their online presence with poor reviews. It sucks when morons are in charge of stuff."
cly2n6,"NTA, would have been ESH, but your brother asked you if you wanted to hangout. All you did was call him out. Overall it kinda sucks."
cly3aw,"YTA but not a big one. Imo you should have told your wife about it before this so it wasn’t sprung on her. You didn’t have to give it to her, but it was the original intention in giving it to you, which makes you TA."
cly5yw,"NTA. That sounds like six shades of discomfort all rolled into one, and you're not obliged to be in that situation, especially since she created it."
cly708,"“My children adore them, and have grown very close to them.” Yeah, maybe don’t kill and eat your children’s close companions? YTA 1000% if you do. Especially as it seems that the initial plan was to keep them for eggs, not to eat them, but now that it’s becoming inconvenient the plan suddenly changes. I appreciate it may be straining your time but this would severely damage your relationship with your children. Are they old enough to take on the burden of looking after the chickens?"
cly70l,NTA. It's generally reasonable to charge rent (though this seems like a lot) but not after you came there specifically because of their promise not to charge rent.
cly7dh,"NTA- you already gave her advice.  If she doesn’t want to take it, giving it to her again will be a waste of breath.

Frankly I think it will be better for her if you don’t, because it will force her to start taking responsibility for her own decisions."
clyc5y,NTA He shouldn't be stating 'the whole class' feel or 'so and so said' if they don't/didn't. A class rep position is not for him to feel in control of things it's for feedback and dialogue between the class and lecturers. You could have said things in a more diplimatic way but you were frustrated and annoyed at being misquoted.
clygww,NTA. there's a reason it's not on the menu.
clyjoa,NTA and you should take that as the sign to GTFO as quickly as possible
clyk5b,"NTA. It's literally no parents business what your daughter is doing as long as it's all safe and legal. It would make absolutely no sense for you to not allow your bisexual daughter to have a sleepover with a boy but allow a sleepover with a girl. It might even make your daughter think you aren't taking her sexuality seriously or saying that interactions with boys are more ""real"" than interactions with girls. That lady accused you of being a poor parent and insinuated that you were selling kids drugs. You had the right to lash out at her."
clym7a,"NTA, it's not a requirement of being a good person to like kids. As long as you're not going out of your way to be a dick to them (which you're not) then there's no problem."

Your mental health diagnosis should remain as private as possible and shouldn't be blurted out loud like that.  When things cooled down, that discussion should have been done between just the two of you, without any audience.

However, the tricky thing for you is that you are not really in a position to judge your own behavior and its effects on others.  This is a classic problem and you need the perspective of others.  Please consult your psychiatrist.  These meds generally need to be tapered off of.  Cold turkey is not a good idea at all."

- Fast forward, he gets tired of the game, and wants a Switch instead. 
- Cool, you guys say you can trade it in with some of YOUR stuff you don't use anymore, because he's jobless. You get store credit so that it can be used when he finally decides to get his shit together and gets a job. He doesn't get a job, and you dump him. 

**Post-breakup**

- The store credit that you got from trading in all of the stuff he returned is used to purchase games for yourself.

I loudly say I’ll ask the server for change, but Boris yells “just cover Sam and have her break your ten!” I did it but I gave him the money very aggressively.

When i see them do it, I always say, excuse me! And check for dents and they always say, i didn’t dent it. But I make a big deal just so they (hopefully) learn a lesson to watch out for other cars.

Our sons have a friendship group that went through the same thing.  Their friend is still a part, but he was made fully aware (which he really already knew) that his SO was really screwing up the dynamics for everyone else.  He now spends time with her separate from his time with the group, although she *is* included on occasion.   Compromise.

The going back and forth and saying the dog would be lonely/die without the other dogs is unnecessary (as was threatening to call the police), and it's never a good look for parents to complain about their children on facebook."
cm5cmv,"NTA at all. I don't even know where to start, they expected you to work to their advantage instead of as a team and booted you because you had less time than them. To be quite fair, fuck them. I think you leaving was the best possible scenario. You cut some cancer from your life and you moved on. That's life, btw what major did you do that took so much time?"
cm5eac,YTA. It's not a bartender's job to get you drunk. It actually IS their job to stop serving you before you get drunk.
cm5hay,"NTA, you two both being women has nothing to do with how good you'd be at comforting her. He's her brother, he needs to be there for her."
cm5kvo,"Honestly I think its less important that you cut them out because youre already in such low contact and you really get a therapist. Youre NTA at all for feeling like your family doesnt try enough with you, but I dont think cutting them off is really going to make that big of a difference overall. Maybe head over to the justno subs you'll probably find some like-minded people there who can help you give the tools you need to cut these people off and keep those boundaries up. But really, talk to someone please, I think it will really help your healing process."
cm5oav,"NTA. You seem like you go above and beyond already. I think it’s unreasonable of your friend to expect so much from you. Sometimes you need to look after number 1, and that’s you. You are getting resentful of your friendship with her and it’s totally understandable. Enjoy your hens!"
cm5ohn,"NAH. It’s not unreasonable to want your family to know the names of your children and remembering names can be challenging, and not for lack of caring or trying. I know I’ve had troubles, increasingly so as I’ve gotten older. Good luck."
cm5olv,"ESH
Grabbing someone while arguing is a bad idea on many levels, so doing that does make you an asshole... But pressuring a teenager into unhealthy dieting is way, way more harmful in the long run. It was good that you stood up to her, even if you didn't do so in the most graceful way.
Also, your mom is kind of an asshole too for allowing another adult to treat you that way."
cm5paz,"NTA - So your dad had the possibility of having the company pay for car storage, I'm assuming he also had the option of taking a taxi/uber. I'm having trouble following his thought process on why you should be expected to make 2 round trips to the airport"
cm5qdu,"ESH. You and yours are definitely immature in the way you handled everything. However, his cure all demand is also immature and unrealistic for working adults...and honestly anyone."
cm5r6q,[deleted]
cm5sf8,"NTA - ""I haven't been gossiping... but I _have_ been gossiping."" 

I don't know if your friend actually thought that response got him off the hook or said anything other than, yep, I told everyone, and fuck you cause I'm going to keep telling everyone but don't ever call it gossip."
cm5u4b,I've done some reflecting and I definitely see this being the case. If this happens again in the future I think I'll ride onwards and not look back.
cm5wnl,"NAH. You’re free to fly the coop and go start your career in another state., and it’s conscientious to wait until it was a sure thing before telling people. Also totally normal for your Dad to find this hard but he’ll be ok. Enjoy your move and good luck with the job."
cm5xzi,NTA. This is extremely necessary information for the decision of custody.
cm5y2f,NTA. Someone said something about your relationship to you. It’s common instinct to fight back. Fight or flight.
cm616l,"NTA, seems ok to me. She should control her child"
cm64q7,"Very, very gentle YTA because you went into her purse after she declined and then attempted to lie about it. I certainly agree with the sentiment that couples, and really those in any friend relationship as well, should support each other. This may not have went over better, but I’d have bought food that I know she likes and then if she complained said well I’m here and would eat it too... Best wishes."
cm64s2,"NTA, he has to chill. Maybe you could pull over some day, instead of continue driving, and tell him he needs to shut the fuck up (in a more subtil way, of course), or at least talk respectfully to you because yelling doesn't help for learning. After all, you are the driver, and you have a legal license so he should respect how you drive (unless the car was his). Anyway, NTA."
cm65m7,NTA. Family dynamics are complicated and if this drama is impacting your health and well-being staying away is the right decision. Best wishes.
cm66d2,"This is the clearest Esh I've seen on the sub so far. They are crap Neighbors oh, so you are crap neighbor in return out of spite.

Everyone sucks. They suck more."
cm66zg,NTA: Eventually you'll just stop being invited. Problem solved.
cm68hi,"NTA. They took advantage of you being their friend while you were their boss. Sometimes doing your job means you don’t make or keep friends. You saved them from getting fired, and you should go enjoy the event regardless."
cm6d3b,NAH it’s your game i doubt they’ll even ask about it
cm6emz,NTA what a double standard jesus
cm6f2z,"How inconsiderate of him! Going and **dying in an aircraft toilet** just to ruin your flight. 

The old guy probably did it on purpose just to slight you.

YTA. Oh *man* YTA."
cm6fej,NTA. You have standards to which you hold the people you associate with. Don't feel bad about that.
cm6i1q,"NTA- you don’t owe him a single thing. If he wants to insult you and your husband when first meeting you as an adult, fuck em, let him figure it out on his own. You did good for yourself, no need to let him freeload off of you. Just because you’re blood relatives doesn’t mean your family."

cm6o0a,"NTA - What is he expecting from this situation, you being 15 (12 at the time)? That you promise to pay him back when you get to working age? I'm sorry but your uncle shipped a piece of his sanity with that board game of something"
cm6p18,"NTA, at all. Perhaps she doesn’t realize, so do tell her. If she doesn’t respect it I’d have no issue blocking her account. Best wishes."
cm6rdx,"NAH

You reacted perfectly fine. It seemed to have happened too quickly for you to do anything more about it. We don't know that person's situation so we don't know what danger you would have been in had you let him in (considering he was running from someone trying to hurt him). Good move calling the cops. Hope that guy is ok."
cm6s8o,"YTA. It's not sexual harassment, but it's ridiculous for you to get self-righteous when someone points out it's not appropriate for the workplace."
cm6uiv,[deleted]
cm7187,"NTA, but this is tricky. Food can be an addiction, and flat out pressuring an addict to stop can cause them to go on the defensive like you described. I wish I knew the magic words for you to say to help him turn it around, but I don't."
cm71t5,"""if she refuses to shut her door, she needs to accept that my dog can get in there"" but you said her door can't be shut completely? As a dog owner, YTA, keep a better eye on your dog and don't let it roam into other people's rooms. Your roommate isn't going to be responsible if your dog eats something dangerous or harmful while sneaking into her room.
Edit: typo"
cm72fd,"NTA - don’t let him take the excitement out of learning something new, either."
cm7493,"Sorry but this is your fault. I don't understand you blaming your mom for this at all. You choose to live with her knowing that she has issues with the police. And you use drugs there, knowing they are illegal. Those are risks you choose to take. Time to grow up and accept responsibility for yourself. Your mom might suck for other stuff, but based on this particular issue, YTA"
cm76ze,"Stop doing what you are doing. You are not even really helping her. You are teaching her very bad habits that will not fly in the real world. You need to let her face her own consequences and focus on yourself.

NTA"
cm778j,"YTA.

For going straight to his mother without taking to him first, and for thinking it's any of your business. The guy's father is absent, living in another country, and you demand to know if it's because of illegal activity?"
cm79ee,"NTA

You did and said the right thing. Anyone who messes with your dogs messes with you."
cm79pp,"Bartender here. If my boss made racist or homophobic comments to me during service, I'd throw my apron at him and walk right the fuck out, no matter how busy it was. In fact, I'd probably relish the thought of him scrambling to keep shit together with a short staff, the prick.

Your former colleagues are probably just salty that they were weeded for a bit after you left. They probably made a bunch of money with one less server, though, so that's a bullshit reason to whine. If they don't think that anti-LGBTQ hostility from management is a good reason to quit on the spot, they were probably shitty friends to begin with. NTA."
cm7aa1,"NTA. And the fact that your husband's ""therapy"" involves him befriending fellow abusers doesn't inspire confidence one bit."
cm7c40,"NTA.

I once heard a teacher describe kids as puppies. And in a sense they ar ejust like pets. They respond to positive and negative reinforcement. It's a bit different when they're older. Obviously there's much more to it than just raising them as pets but it's a good basis lmao.

Not sure what your friend was expecting."

cm7frq,"NTA don’t feel forced to go to an event if you don’t want to. I’d probably expect her to cut all ties with you or at least give you grief if you don’t go, she sounds a bit temperamental in your post"
cm7jan,"You're only an asshole if your boyfriend is sad and needs support. If he isn't sad and doesn't care, then there's no issue."
cm7l5j,"Be aware - my opinion usually goes against the grain here. 

I'll say you're NTA. If you're closer to the supervisor and like the supervisor better then the other guy, it's not even a question. If the other guy is your friend, and closer to you then the supervisor, then it gets a bit muddy, perhaps.

You didn't include many details, but from what you told, I'd say you're not the asshole."
cm7mhz,"NTA
That is disgusting. He picked on you knowing how young and innocent you were. I do not blame you, have you ever spoken to anybody about it?"
cm7mu3,YTA because it seems like you’re trying to distance your kids from their Nigerian roots. “Mostly white” wtf? If people can learn to say Tchaikovsky they can learn to say your husband’s “unusual” name 🙄
cm7ndr,"NTA. You were broken up, you had no reason to get him a gift, even after you guys got back together in the same month it was well after his birthday. I don’t understand why he expects a gift from you? I feel like being back together should be good enough."
cm7vnc,NTA. You find the time when you’re living in the home with an infant.
cm7xw0,"Christ man, just tell him the situation as it is, no fucking around, no leaving it for later hoping it'll be fine. ""Either get the color right, or you won't be let in."" He'll probably bitch, ""It's my wedding, not yours"" could be an appropriate response.

NAH"
cm850a,NTA He doesn't sound like a good friend. It's not your job to babysit him.
cm8547,"You don't think the friend was kind of an asshole? He invited OP over under false pretenses, forced them to go to a party they didn't want to go to, and left them alone among people they didn't know. Seems dickish to me."
cm875q,"NTA, you're allowed to be antisocial when you need space. Speak to your therapist about it and have them speak to your mother."
cm88ni,NTA Sounds like this is an ongoing issue and that she has been overly relying on your goodwill. You are not obligated to lend her anything. If she is financially stable and has regular need of a rain jacket then she should be able to buy her own.
cm88wt,"NTA in either scenario - you were totally anonymous and used the subreddit as it was intended to be used - but tbh this post is a little obnoxious so you're probably going to be told the opposite. That being said, it seems like you tried to stir the pot by telling her about posting, but that's not what you asked."
cm8cio,Oh my god you are definitely NTA. You are a 17 year old that is entitled to your own privacy. You’re being very mature in saying you’d still let him go through it but with your permission. Luckily my parents never did any of that stuff and respected me growing up. You are not in the wrong here.
cm8iaf,"NTA: You were venting to a friend. Chiara had zero right to snoop through your phone either in the ""true"" way it happened or her made up BS way.  You didn't say anything to your sister, and she has no idea."
cm8jzu,"NTA

It is normal for a kid to become interested in poop when they first discover it, just like with everything else. But usually this happens around age 2, not 5. Playing with poop at age 5 is not normal and should not be condoned or ignored. Its very unhealthy."
cm8lbz,YTA on so many levels. You stole from your fiance and from your cousin. You made him look like an idiot. You dont trust your fiance. Why are you engaged at 16? You dont even know who you are yet.

There's really no correct way to deal with people dropping that sort of avoidable drama and nonsense on your ""turf"", fucking up what supposed to be a chill, happy time in a fundamentally rude way. If she'd just been crying and in crisis, it would be one thing, but she was behaving in a way I wouldn't want my kids around for."

cm8tud,"YWBTA. It’d be funny af. It really would. But I think waking him up when he’s trying to sleep would get the point across more. Turning off the breakers is gonna inconvenience him for what? 30 minutes tops assuming he doesn’t find the breakers? Then he’s gonna be even more of a douche. Keeping him up 
, while still a assholish move gets the point across because you’re doing EXACTLY to him what he’s doing to you."
cm8wq4,NTA but be prepared for the outburst. It’ll likely come but through it remember you’re not the asshole. Weddings can be stressful as hell. Some more than others. If you don’t think you can handle that particular wedding then so be it.
cm8x3g,"esh. your mom should've seen that as an adult, there was something wrong. you shouldn't have told her that she CAUSED your friend's mental health issues, but KINDLY said she should've called it in. the mom is TA for obvious reasons."
cm92f6,"NTA had it been the other way around, you probably wouldn't feel the need to post here."
cm97pa,NAH - I think you should email him or look him up on Facebook at the very least but in my opinion that's all you should really be expected to do. It'd take you a total of 5 minutes so it's not like you're going out of your way.
cm9act,NTA.  V doesn't have ownership over this guy.  She's being unreasonable and controlling.
cm9fa8,"NTA

But I would still urge you to go. Not for him. But for your brother, and for yourself.

You being a good person has nothing to do with him being a shity stepfather. 

I would look at it more like visiting my brother's father, than visiting my stepfather."

cm9i1r,"YTA

I, too, hate it when people smoke in big standing crowds, even if it's just normal tobacco. The fact that they didn't start yelling at the very beginning is perhaps because the smell didn't reach them yet. When I first read this I thought they started yelling after you put it out, which would make them the assholes too, but apparently I just read it wrong."
cm9m1s,"NTA, they can't make errors, refuse to fix them and expect you to pay the full price either way. Let them fix it, get a really good discount or sue them. This could also serve as a lesson to the company so they'll do the work right for the next costumers."
cm9ncp,"NTA. When it comes to selling them she is claiming they are hers at that point and it’s up to her what she wants to do with them, including selling them. That in itself is a valid viewpoint.

However, according to her she also gets to dictate to you what you do with them when they are still yours and get the arse when you don’t do what she wants.

So either she needs to let you keep some say after you pass things on, including a share of any proceeds, or she can keep her nose out of what you do with your stuff when it is still yours. Same rules should apply to both of you."
cm9qtn,"NTA are you kidding? Sure, having a car when going grocery shopping is a great bonus but it is in no way impossible to go shopping without one. Either take the bus or just go by foot and don't buy more than you can carry. It's not rocket science. You're in no way the asshole here."
cm9rwp,"You’re in a 3 year relationship, not a 3 month one. Going to Amsterdam alone w a guy friend to get high must be a high priority to you. This is how you wish to spend your vacation time. Must make your partner feel really important.

What’s jealousy to some is healthy self-preservation to others. Boyfriend’s not a fool. For most across the gender spectrum this would b disrespectful to a relationship.

The standard on Reddit for this topic (that this is cool & an objecting partner must be jealous/insecure) is inconsistent with nearly every monogamous couple I’ve known in my life.

The notion that BF is simply insecure/jealous is an insult- it minimizes him on so many levels.

BF has reasonable boundaries and concerns. It doesn’t sound likely that his objection is an expression of flaws in his character. You’ve mentioned no pattern of jealous behavior on his part.

I won’t say YTA, but I won’t say you’re not. I feel for BF. You may as well go at this point, the damage is already done. He knows where he stands- his concerns/boundaries are of small concern to you.

Rest assured you’ll find plenty of validation here. This is what you’re posting for. You’re clearly going alone on vacay w your guy friend. BF already knows where he stands. He gets to stay home while you party with another dude in Amsterdam and reevaluate if you’re the woman for him."
cm9syp,"ESH

Kicking her out alone would not have made you an asshole. But you clearly used the word “pig” as a quip at her weight. 

But fuck her for

A) Making employees clean up her literal shit

and B) Sitting back down on your chairs with shit caked to her ass cheeks.

You’re an asshole here but I’d have done the same thing. I have a very low tolerance for bullshit. I get it."
cm9wda,"NAH

You are under no obligation to commission your friend. That said, if you do so, you would be entitled to give some direction as to how you want your character protested. This might lead to both a drawing you like, and to your friend more correctly portraying your character in future work they do for free."
cm9x2i,"Maybe NTA but you are an idiot. 

Five or six seconds isn't that long. Plus, moving up doesn't gain you anything except a few feet of driveway. There are still cars in front of him. It's not like he was holding up the person serving food. 

I've seen people lose their shit over stuff like that. I once saw a car straight up put their car in reverse and ram the car behind them for honking. (That was a wonderful day at the drive thru!) 

And not long ago, someone in my town got into a disagreement at at drive-thru, then chased the other guy down, ran him off the road, and shot him. 

It's just not worth it."
cm9x3k,"NTA

Why would they have a give-away drawing if it is expected for you to give your winnings back?  That's just dumb."

cm9y7k,what? this isn’t how insurance works lmao
cm9zky,"NAH, you both had problems with the other one smoking, and neither of you addressed it with the other party. 

She's allowed to hang out on her balcony all day if she wants, and she can complain about you smoking if she wants. Just like you're allowed to smoke if you want, and can silently stew about her comments if you want. 

But, have you tried talking to her about it? 

Also, I know she's a pain in your ass, but she sounds really lonely. It's sad."
cma0c7,"YTA.  Jeez, it just one guy you don't know.  You'll outnumber him 6-1.  Quit being so scared of guys.  He could be very nice, funny, etc for all you know."

cma2dg,"NTA he made his bed he has to sleep in it. There are consequences to actions and he’s going to have to work a lot harder to earn your trust back and he may never succeed. You look after you, don’t focus on him, not anymore, he has no power over you, it’s over. Fuck him and his remorse."

cmaigq,"ESH. They're immature for carrying on. That being said, your ""things you did"" would beyond ruin most roommate relationships. I'm not sure what you expected. I'm not surprised they're acting that way. Should they? Perhaps not.

> I was a good friend to them once. 

Well, after that you went completely nutty on them for a bit. Have you, I don't know, apologized? Have you tried to clear the air? Talk about what you guys can do to mend your relationship? I see a lot of blaming them and not a lot of acknowledgement of your own actions. Things like this

> A few weeks after that I asked her how her night was. She looked at me with absolute disgust and berated me for daring to ask about her personal life. I explained to her that we are all living together and she just could say “fine thanks”. She just went at me for however long and then went back to ignoring me. 

I'm not sure I believe you in a full way, especially since you're playing up ""physical assault"" in other comments. I think you guys have reached the end of your time as roommates. Maybe you need to find alternative arrangements."
cmalav,NTA. I can't believe the rest of the people in line not only put up with this but supported them in their line cutting. Good for you for not only standing your ground but realizing when it was no longer worth it.
cmamv1,"YTA first for making your friend feel like a third wheel on a group outing and second for telling her to fuck off for dancing with your fiancee. You do realize it's cool for friends and family to dance with your partner sometimes, right? Are you going to tell your in-laws to fuck off during the father/daughter dance at your wedding?"
cmamwk,"NAH

Unless you’re like banging shit around then I’m just gonna assume especially since you don’t need to run the shower your roommate is just a light sleeper. That’s sucks for him but it’s not your fault and you shouldn’t have to alter your routine for him if you’re already being accommodating. If you want too that’s fine, but no you’re not an asshole if you don’t cause you’re already being gracious imo."
cman4i,">I am not looking for punishment

cmau1l,"NTA

You absolutely did not catfish him. If you were white and and dyed you hair from blonde to red before a date, no one would call that catfishing. It’s the same with your natural hair. I do suggest putting up pictures with your natural hair just so you can weed out trash like that in the future and save yourself a lot of trouble."

cmayes,NTA. As I understand it you made an agreement and your employer is not sticking to it. Stand your ground and maybe start looking for a new place to work in the meantime. This place treats you terribly.
cmazlr,"NTA your immature step father freaked out over nothing. His behavior was irrational and extremely unjustified. Your mom doesn’t seem to understand what happened or she just doesn’t care.

cmb4ra,"NAH you seem to have strong views about drug use and I do encourage you to deepen your understanding of addiction and maybe gain some empathy for them, however, if you're not directly coming out and saying you dont feel bad, I dont think you're an asshole because it's not hurting anyone"

cmb8v9,NTA. The phone number is there specifically for this.
cmb935,"NAH as long as you tell him. If he so badly wants you to go, then he should have no problem covering the gas."
cmbbkc,"NTA

You should point out his recent spending when he moans.
I can't afford X
Well you were able to spend £Y only the other day so maybe you need to plan better.

I only suggest that because he sounds like he wants to get subbed by you. If it was just him I'd say leave it but since you are adamant you are going to live with him you just know he'll be pleading poverty, asking you to cover his rent or bills, eating your food then going buying himself stuff

Eventually you will blow and the friendship will go down the crapper."
cmbbvz,"YTA for lying instead of just telling them you couldn't handle the spice level. It probably hurt their feelings more to see you picking at meals as if they were bad cooks. Next time, just be honest, and ask for a glass of milk."
cmbf7b,"NTA because you didn't force the issue, you just asked and they declined. That's fine. What a weird hill for a Subway employee to die on."
cmbh08,"Do you use the bathroom and not flush too? Clean up your shit.

YTA"
cmbjhg,NTA for reporting her depression to someone who can hopefully help her.
cmbkn9,"NTA for the exact reasons you stated, no reason to lie about real horrific incidents that happen to LGBTQ+ members but also, hateful people do hateful things. If that woman is known and targeted, that would be bad. Plus, very unlikely, but slander is illegal and I'd be curious if it would apply here due to potential damages to the person's psyche and life if it's a smallish town"
cmblo5,"NTA but I think it's time to nix the food-sharing altogether. Every time I've tried an arrangement like that with roommates, someone takes advantage of it. Not worth the hassle imo."
cmbne7,"NAH. What do your sister and her husband have to apologize for? Gifts they received from your father are not your business. Rather than flying off the handle at them, why don’t you have a conversation with your father about this? He’s the one who owes you an explanation."
cmboig,Definitely NTA. I would never want to sleep with someone my best friend slept with. Loyalty is important.
cmbp6l,"NTA. I don't think she's necessarily unreasonable to ask for gas money, but HOW she asked, then HOW she reacted makes her TA."
cmbpai,NTA - It's not like you hopped in front of him while he was waiting for the ramp to come down
cmbqp7,NAH. Your mental health is THE MOST important thing in your life. Nothing else measures up. That is because you can’t reach your full potential when your mental health is at 5%. Go home and take a breather; I’m sure your parents will be at ease knowing that you’re actively taking steps to ensure that you’re feeling 100%.
cmbye2,Nah- it’s not really in your place to correct. It’s not even really grammatically incorrect even if the tone may be odd. It’s more of a “thanks for asking. I’m fine.”
cmc01q,"NAH - you're perfectly find to buy whatever car you want with your money.

It makes sense that your bf would rather you both purchase a car that you will both use seeing as you have been sharing the care you have now though, as to suddenly be without a car would be very inconvenient.

Is there any way you can sell him the care you currently have?"
cmc10h,"NTA - your mom is trying to pass the buck to you because she doesn’t feel like doing it. It’s her husband, you passed it back."
cmc7by,"NAH. On one hand, I would personally let her (visually impaired myself). I would use every resource available to make sure my daughter has the best shot possible.

On the other hand, I totally understand not wanting to use something personal. NAH."
cmc8fm,NTA. The sandwich was only free because of their incompetence initially. That doesn't forgive additional incompetence in getting the order wrong.
cmc9mo,"YTA Your friend is right, repeating those stereotypes is just as bad as when your other friend's dad does it. Your friend was offended and instead of stopping, you continued to make jokes at his expense. That is why you are the asshole."
cmc9o9,NTA - your brother needs help.
cmca39,"YTA. the kid knows, and you're probably making him feel worse about it"
cmcaa4,"I don't see this as ""crossing the line"", it seems like a pretty normal and casual thing. It's not rational for it to bother you this significantly.

YTA"
cmcdcn,"NTA.  Your sister and mom definitely should have checked with you first.

I don't really have any advice other than that you would definitely be seen as the asshole if you take them back now.  I think for the sake of your relationship with your niece, you should just let her have them.

The only possible curve ball here is the collector's value.  How much are you talking here?  Hundreds?  Thousands?  What did your mom and sister say about that?"
cmcfse,[deleted]
cmchpo,She unmatched before you two even met?  That's really odd and I'd probably would have not even showed.  NAH.
cmcidg,NTA - You need a healthy work life balance and you deserve some time to do Dungeons and Dragons. Your mom sounds like an asshole
cmcj45,"ESH - It doesn't really sound like she begged you.  It sounds like she asked and you said yes.  As you said yourself you did all the extra stuff off your own back.   Sometimes something isn't what you expect, if she was uncomfortable you're damn right she is within her rights to change her mind and go home.  Especially as it sounded like she might have been ill.  But she should have showed some gratitude and apologised."
cmcjy5,Not being rich is not the same as being poor. YTA.
cmcktt,"NTA.

If someone invites me, I’m not going to invite other people. That’s just rude."
cmcma3,"NTA.

She is being sexist and it is completely fair to withdraw from her project. Although I would first have a discussion w/ her on her misandrist POV"
cmcmxk,YTA. He's been nice enough to watch over the puppy. He shouldn't have to stick to an overbearing schedule that makes him go even more out of his way. Hire someone professionally if you have demands like that.
cmcoju,"NTA.

Being a bride doesn't give you an excuse to be a bitch. She can find bridesmaid #3 if that is how she is going to act."
cmcou6,NTA: Funny as fuck.
cmcq7l,"Tow. That. Shit. 

I’ll take down votes. I have a 24-hour rule. I leave a polite, non rude note letting the person know they parked in someone’s spot and please not to do it again. Or if I know the person lives in my building I call the manager like you did 

The moment 24-hours goes by I call my landlord and let them know I’d like the car gone. I’m paying money and this is my spot. I rent a second spot for guests. 

But ESH. Parking to close and posting online just adds fuel to the fire. You don’t need to do that. It’s needless drama."
cmctqf,"YTA (i.e. your stepfather is the asshole)

Warranties are there to replace defective products.  The tools did not fail because of a manufacturing defect;  they were burned in a fire.  That's not covered by the warranty, because it's not Craftsman's fault.

Instead, your stepdad should put a claim for the value of the tools against his homeowner's insurance.  *That* is the proper avenue to replace items destroyed in a house fire."
cmcwg4,"NAH - I'm not going to judge anyone an asshole here because it sounds like a really difficult situation all around frankly.

It sounds like your mom is dealing with some mental illness that has gone unchecked for a while, something beyond normal anxiety. Maybe BPD or something. FOr that reason I won't label her an asshole, especially if she is as you say usually a caring and loving mother.

I get that your homelife sucks and is affecting your mental health. Is there a counselor or someone you can talk to? I will say that being a 15 year old dealing with mental illness really fucking sucks and it can be very damaging in how we view our parents. 

At the risk of irretrievably ruining your relationship with your mother I wouldn't tell her that you don't want a relationship with her until your older. If you still feel the same way at 18 then fair enough, move out and live your life without your mom. But if you say it to her now, and then a few years down the line realize that everything that happened was because you were both ill and didn't have the help you needed, then I would hate for you to regret having that conversation. Also, I think your home life for the next few years would be really awful after having such a conversation.

Good luck to you though, it sounds like your whole family needs it. You should sit your father down and have a very serious conversation about how this is affecting you."
cmcx9z,"NTA, your girlfriend sounds like an ass, but saying you ‘don’t know who is the asshole’ is a bit of a laugh because you know it perfectly well yourself."
cmcxgk,"Please be careful and be gentle with yourself, whatever you choose to do! All the best."
cmcysz,"YTA - don't do that -- it's tacky. Yes, it sucks that you and your wife did not get the concert experience you deserved and that the night went downhill but it isn't logical to me that he should pay for it all, considering what happened was entirely out of his control? You see it as you and your wife had an anticipated night that turned out to to be an entire inconvenience, he sees it as supporting his girlfriend after finding out about her father's health. The most you are entitled to, I think, is maybe a cleaning fee for your car. Not expensive concert tickets."
cmd20t,[deleted]
cmd6a3,"NTA. Tell him you’re cooking for two by default and if he wants you to cook for him, he has to communicate same before you start cooking. Put the onus on him."
cmd7at,NTA—cutting off toxic people for your own sanity is 100% okay and not your fault. You’re not obligated to continue to be abused.
cmd8fa,"NTA, although I'm borderline bothered that you tipped at all.  Yes, I understand that tips are a part of how waitstaff make a living - you're not obligated to give money to someone who goes out of their way to insult your \[boyfriend's\] identity."
cmdavc,"NAH - it sounds like he was maybe trying to be friendly/spark further conversation with you, and when you said ""why don't you try"" and walked away he may have gotten offended. But he also didn't seem to try to pursue any further conversation with you that you shut down, so you weren't being a jerk."
cmdd7y,NAH but don't expect them to say yes. Doesn't hurt to ask though
cmddwi,"YTA. If their house is disgusting, stop visiting them. If they ask why, tell them the truth."
cmdedz,YTA for wasting our time over a fucking cricket.
cmdf5y,"NAH. Caregiver fatigue is a thing - this is a lot to deal with, it's understandable that you'd have trouble coping. I would suggest going back to therapy, just get a different therapist. You should be coming out of your sessions with developing coping skills, not resentment.  Under normal circumstances, you would totally be TA for not being sensitive to your wife's illness, but in this circumstance I can see what effect her prolonged illness has had on you. I don't think you actually resent your wife - I think you resent her illness, and you are struggling to cope."
cmdfjh,"ESH, it would have taken you 2 minutes to explain this to Lyft. That being said, the driver is the major AH here. This driver sounds like a danger to her passengers. If you don't tell Lyft about these problems she will keep getting away with it, and the longer she does the more likely she will cause a serious accident."
cmdh1h,"
NTA. You’re an adult and you can be called fucking Danger Mouse if that’s how you identify. Your family needs to get over it."
cmdhmt,ESH except the guy. You should tell him. Wouldn't you want to know?
cmdi0r,NTA. She can't even say you weren't using it if she had to dump your stuff out. Your mom clearly had issues with personal property.
cmdj7g,"NTA. 

> I was sworn to secrecy

What part of this do you not understand?"
cmdjoe,"NTA, but I think it's worth adjusting the email a bit. 

“I’m sorry Ms. S, but I cannot afford to miss another day of work due to unclear communication. I am now in a position where I may miss my state exam due to not having enough training hours. 

Please let me know if you can do anything in your power to allow me to continue on to take my state exam on my scheduled date without having to schedule an extra makeup date aside from the one I already have for this Friday. 
Thank you. “

And then if she pushes back on this, write back with the paragraphs I deleted to show that it's her fault that you're in this situation. Right now, I think it's important for you to get what you need, which is your training hours done before your exam...without making her angry."
cmdk1j,NTA. He's freeloading. It is your prerogative to ask for compensation.
cmdksn,NAH - they should have taken you to the dentist more but considering you have moved out and provide for yourself it makes sense that they reacted this way.
cmdm5n,"NTA, but this is a delicate topic and I honestly don't know how you could have handled this better except to have put out different chairs for when company comes over."
cmdm8s,">people often take it personally when someone doesn't like dogs for some reason

They do! And seem to be mortally offended that you don't like dogs, they try convince you their dog is the nicest... 

NAH"
cmdnrx,"NAH. But what's the REAL reason you don't want her buying these things? Tell her that, gently. 

When you told her “it makes me feel bad when you buy things for my house - it’s like pointing out all the ways my house is not adequate for you,” you were assuming her reason for buying those things. You have no idea what she's actually thinking. 

Focus on why you don't want the things. Not on her reasons."
cmdnv6,"I'm sorry, what?  This is the most ridiculous shit.  Your mom obviously is the one who thinks your FB photo isn't great.  NTA; just delete and block your parents so they don't have to look at it.  

She seriously cried?"
cmdos7,"Dude, it's Texas, cracking the window? Yuck. I've lived here all my life and even when that's acceptable weather-wise, which it isn't in the summer, the pollen counts and humidity are murder for a lot of people.

Find a compromise temperature like adults. 

ESH."
cmdr7i,"INFO - are you living with your parents for financial reasons, as in, you cannot afford to live on your own anymore?

If so, YTA - you should be saving up to move on with your life, not wasting hundreds of dollars on tattoos."
cmdut1,"NTA. You can associate with whoever you want to, even if they’re family.

This just sounds unpleasant."
cmdvwb,"NTA Three extra people who you barely know want to crash your camping trip, they are rude as shit.

Don't let these commenters shame you for not wanting to invite strangers."

cmdxg5,"YTA. It's your *mother.* You only get one, and when she's gone you'll wish she was around to send you pictures."
cme0s2,"NTA - You don't have to have a relationship with anyone you don't want to. 

You especially don't have an obligation to a parent who obviously didn't feel an obligation to you."
cme2tv,"YTA.

You should have created a new page, in order to avoid this sort of confusion. Further, by commandeering a page, it forecloses using that page in the future if folks decide to resume doing business."
cme5vj,I love my elf deck so much that I just goldfish it sometimes. Gaea's cradles are mad expensive now.
cme6c2,"NTA. From the title of your post it sounded like you quit via no-call-no-show.  But IMO you did effectively communicate that you quit.

""Two weeks notice"" is not legally required anywhere.  Two seconds notice is plenty."
cme6ho,"NTA. Is he pushing you to get a hold of her?  If he wanted to take the fall, then he has to - you know - take the fall and pay the fine.  Who TF brings glass to a river float anyway?"
cme7kf,"ESH  I get the party wasn't what you expected, but you left abruptly, insulted her friends (whether you meant to or not) and kind of came across as condescending.  You could have told sis hey, it was great to see you, but I'm dyin' here and am probably gonna head out.""

She sucks because she went to personal attacks.  Perhaps the way you went about it put her on the defensive, and banning you fo the one incident was kind of shitty.  (This assumes this is not a pattern.)"
cme916,NTA I would be annoyed too. What I would do is but brown tape over my own buzzer. People will think it's broken but you can tell you guests that it works.

cmekrk,"NTA. I'd be livid if I were you.

That's YOUR bed, not his. And it's not like there wasnt another option available.

Is this guy that oblivious, or is he just dumb as a box of rocks?"
cmekxq,"NAH  


I'd say your reaction is justified, but you still might've overreacted a bit. Your friend is trying to build up her career, it doesn't mean she disregards you as a friend. Unexpected things can happen and it's not like she didn't tell you that she'd come some other time. Yeah, it sucks to get your expectations ruined / altered by other people's plans, but in the end, does it really matter that much for your friend to visit you specifically on your birthday?"
cmenv5,"NAH, Shes not doing anything that wrong, just weird and you're fine to think what you do about her. Talk to her if you want about it but it's no big deal so don't make it too big of a thing. If her other comments about culture and race do annoy you you're fine to talk to her about it though and fine to be upset"
cmeo66,"YTA.  You got feedback that told you ""hey do this thing"" and your response was to ask for feedback somewhere else that you thought would be more acquiescing to your viewpoint.  The irony of it all was that it wasn't more sympathetic to you, and they just doubled down on the advice you already got."
cmeoje,"NTA.

Your body, your rules. It's as simple as that."
cmepmj,"NTA She knew she left a car in your street. It sounds like she had no problem taking that stuff you want back, she could've taken the car, too. The same thing would've happened if she left the car parked for long enough outside of the house of someone she *didn't* cheat on."
cmeprk,"NTA. Whether their intentions were good or bad, they fucked up. They shouldn't have EVER taken the deer. You were just being honest with them."
cmervn,"YTA You’re allowed to have your own tastes and such, but you opened with saying that you’re actually friends...you certainly aren’t acting like one. You kink shamed him- and continue to in writing this."
cmex5d,"NTA. Your parents are not listening to you.

They boxed you in. They were trying to force you to be more social, and the only choice they left you is to lie, because they wouldn't stop harassing you otherwise.

Don't feel bad, your preferences are completely okay.

>Currently looking at counseling for me to go to, but there’s no way in hell im going to go to anything like that.

However, I'd like to add, don't think of therapy as punishment. Not only mentally ill people go to therapy.

Maybe you can ask your parents for family therapy so they can learn to better listen to you."
cmeyuy,"NTA. Unpopular opinion here, but cheaters are filth and deserve to be outed."
cmf2ho,"YTA - You saved her parents $30 who presumably have separate finances from your fiancee. However, more importantly, you're going to go crazy if you have your future spouse are going to be keeping track of amounts as small as $20."
cmf2vz,"NTA - you were trying to protect your husband from legal issues and it also sounds like he assaulted you?

&#x200B;

What the heck is wrong with people saying YTA?  If his family wants to talk to them they can start a separate group chat.  This one was for updates on your daughter aka their family too, and even after their brother/son did something horrible you're still doing your best to keep the family intact.

&#x200B;

I applaud your BIL, and I'm sorry for the way the others treated you. Would they prefer no contact with you/daughter and/or having your husband go to jail?"
cmf3u0,NTA takin the rug out is pretty much common sense
cmf4re,"NAH - You are into tech and know what can happen when someone with even a little skill can accuse data. 

I am guessing your GF doesn't think of these things the same way you do. I think that this is a fair bit shortsighted on her part. But she's no TA."
cmf6wl,"YTA

She’s only liable for the rent. If you can’t afford the other bills, like WiFi, by yourself and would be “screwed” if someone moved out early that’s just poor management on your end."
cmf984,"NTA. It’s sad she is petty enough to cheat in what is supposed to be a fun game.

If she accidentally did something wrong, that’s a different story."
cmfa95,"ESH - it's illegal to buy minors alcohol and if they got caught YOU would be in trouble. 

HOWEVER leaving with someone else's husband to go to a bar is pretty shitty. If you weren't having fun why stay?"
cmfb3n,NTA your calculation is correct.
cmfeu3,"NTA - It's your kid, your house, your time, your rules. Your system for visitation was fair for all involved. MIL thinks that it isn't fair solely because she can't visit as much as she wants to.  


Take care of your immediate family first, everyone else comes after. They'll learn to deal with it."
cmfkam,"NTA as long as you are prepared to care for it and train it properly. A husky really isn't a 'pet', it's a working dog and as such needs enormous amounts of exercise and stimulation, letting it run round a 'big yard' isn't going to cut it.

Edit - I didn't vote NAH because I think your family are TAs for not looking after the first husky properly."
cmfl7n,I’d get Chrissy to spend as much time with you as possible to give her the best chance of not turning into a racist.
cmflbk,NAH you took a swing at an edgy joke and missed.
cmfn8x,"YTA, sounds like you’re still throwing tantrums if you’re going to stomp your feet and blame your mom when your brother just wants a simple apology."

cmfnip,"You can't live your whole life in fear of ""what if"". You should probably feel safer about going to this, as there will probably be extra security measures because of these events. Go."
cmfs7i,If I were in that position I would just tell her “I feel like other people will think I’m trying to appropriate their culture and don’t really want to change my hairstyle” and if she can’t accept that then she’s TA but this is a big NAH from me
cmfwe6,"NTA. And I will correct you; he’s not looking out for you in any way. 

He’s being really abusive."
cmfyr6,"NAH. He’s not looking for a friend, just someone to help make the rent more affordable. You made the effort and he’s not interested. You’re not an AH if you don’t try to make conversation anymore."
cmg09i,"YWBTA. They told you about the potential conflict ahead of time. Look, part of hosting a large party is the possibility that cancellations will happen. I know it sucks to feel like you lost money, but asking your family to pay you after the fact is a real asshole move."
cmg226,"NTA.  However, I wouldn't phrase it that you don't want her to come.  Just phrase it as you don't mind the one on one time with him, but with her you feel like you have to be in ""host mode"" and that is more than you want all the time.  Most people get this.  There are a couple of my friends where they hardly even consider me a guest anymore, its kind of like ""Oh, its just Illini02, I'm not going to bother putting away the bras that are drying"".  However someone who doesn't go as often, they are going to want to clean up more."
cmg2um,NTA give him his money back and move along. You’re not a bank and you’re not on retainer. He can ask again when he actually has the cash. And when he does make sure you’re charging for your time too!

cmg4qm,NTA- being Trans is HARD in this world so I understand him having troubles. However it did not give him the right to talk advantage of your continued kindness. Tell him how you feel about all of this and hopefully he understands and backs off from this behavior. But if he doesn’t you may have to drop him.
cmg552,NTA - It's your property.  He has no right to it without your say-so.
cmg6bq,"YTA

Lol dude who shows up to a date hungover? And leave early to hit the gym?

Lol no wonder she's not interested in seeing you again.

EDIT: 

Just reread the part about him asking if she wanted to join him at the gym to watch him do leg lifts or some shit. Jesus Christ dude, you really are an asshole. No girl that has any self respect would want to watch you do bicep curls when she could be on a date with someone who is actually interested in her."
cmg6cm,"NTA - you don't owe anyone a fucking explanation. You said no, that's it."
cmg8l6,"NAH. It's 3pm, you're allowed to play music. On the other hand, if you were my neighbor and you frequently played music loud enough that I could hear it I'd be pretty annoyed too."
cmg960,"INFO:

It’s a 3 night stay? I understand the gripe about the hot water, but WiFi?? You really need it? You’re in Barbados!! Are you really going to be spending so much time in your room that you *need* WiFi? To be honest, you do sound spoiled and ungrateful. Like... I’d say YTA but maybe you need WiFi for a special reason or something?"
cmgav7,"NTA like you said, it’s the principle - she needs to learn a lesson and pay for what she’s lost"
cmgayd,NAH. You noticed it today and are getting it checked Thursday. This isn't a long drawn out life changing secret. She doesn't need stress wit everything going on. And theres nothing to be stressed over for now. You did the right thing

cmggqt,"This is a validation post - there is no way that you and your husband are assholes for calling his mother out on a minor issue. I don't think it's really appropriate for this sub.

cmghv4,"NTA

That being said, doing these things (visiting her, attending her funeral) wouldn't be for your grandmother, they'd be for your mom.

I'm not saying you need to do those things, just that I would worry more about how this impacts your mom than grandmother."
cmghwe,YTA. it’s your grandmas body and therefore her choice. it was shady as fuck to give her that without her consent. she also straight up told you when you talked to her about CBD that she didn’t want to try it.
cmgmv6,NTA and if you have a good relationship with your parents/guardian I would recommend asking them to have a chat with your teacher about appropriateness and the fact they should have assisted in getting the strange woman away from you.
cmgq2o,"NTA

At 21 you maybe should have assumed that youd have to pay for yourself - grey area.

You should never bankrupt yourself for a birthday. That's not what birthdays are about."
cmgs3g,"*""One of the kids has been* **stealing food** *at 1/2 in the morning""*

It's not unreasonable for your kids to expect to be fed. You're parents. That's your job. YTA"
cmgthw,"NTA
But you also should mention the cheating especially if you have any evidence. That means she’s less likely to get what she wants."
cmgtps,"Before I had kids, I'd say you're not TA, for sure.  After having kids and experiencing other parents, however, I'd say YTA in this case.

It's not the game that's the problem, it's that when you have someone else's offspring in your house, you're responsible for them.  As a society, we put ratings on video games and movies, and that rating serves as a benchmark for society's view of the appropriateness of the media in question.  If you have no issue with your 11-year old playing CoD, more power to you.  But it shouldn't be surprising when another parent gets frustrated when they realize their kid is playing it at your house."
cmguhw,"While it is not your place to discipline them, it *IS* your Wii U. At the end of the day, it’s your call. 

If it were me, I would’ve kicked them out if they had kicked my dog.

It’s weird to me that they broke up with you and yet they have “unprocessed emotions” about you. You’re friends need to stop putting your exes feelings above yours. They can care about both of your feelings equally.

You say this woman has no one, and that's why your wife helps her. That makes your wife a god damned **HERO**. There are tons of elderly people who fall through the cracks and end up sick and die alone because *no one cares about them*. And here your wife is, **caring**.

Unless you believe that your race is superior or inferior to the other person's race, your comments were not, by definition, racist.  They may have been observational based on your experience.  Of course, that doesn't mean that every person of that race should be expected to order pizza that way, nor does it sound like you said that.

This comment will be downvoted because people no longer understand what any of this really means, and they jump to PC patrol whenever anything is raised.

I think people need to stop associating church with ""family time"" because it makes it awkward for those of us who don't believe, don't like it, or are just not *that kind of religious.* Family time should be eating dinner together, going for a walk, catching up.

Of course she isn’t acting like an adult! She’s a child! She needs to learn failure on her own. If you lead her to failure and she ever finds out, she’ll blame you instead of learning from it. It’ll always be YOUR fault she didn’t get the job (when I think she’ll fail on her own).

First you bad mouth her job to us and smear her social and sexual choices, then you promise her false support, and now you want to punish her for being her own person. Don't miss the bit in there about not telling her you would disinherit her unless she acquiesced to your choices for her uterus but expecting her to know that anyway. 

>The inheritance goes from 3 million for each of them to about 4.5 million for my son and younger daughter

Not in a ""hurr durr trans people need therapy"" way, but in a ""gender dysphoria is a recognized condition that needs to be discussed with a professional who can and will determine what your child is feeling and help guide that path for your family.""

yta for making this decision for your child when it needs to be discussed with a professional."
cmm1pr,"NTA, YOU are not to blame for your MANAGEMENT fucking up. Good for you for having the courage to do this, but don’t be surprised if the health department never follows up, that’s happened to me in the past."
cmm6q0,YTA: is he your chauffeur or your boyfriend? Be grateful he is driving you around as it is. maybe it's time to be an adult and get yourself some reliable transportation
cmm7ra,"I would say NTA 

You checked first before sitting down and kept to your own space.

Did this other woman say WHY you were making them uncomfortable?"
cmm92h,NTA - If there's 3 bathrooms in the house there's no reason to harass someone about being in one of them.
cmm9qb,NTA and your room mate is an asshole for moving his gf in without discussing it with anyone beforehand. She can use the money she's saving by living for free to pay the fine.
cmmabl,"NTA but you guys are all really weird over this. I have a world I just play with my friends and never once have we restarted because new person wanted to join. The map is huge and if anyone wants a new base or wants to do something else just... walk. Find somewhere new. But this is your server that you're maintaining and personally you can do anything you want. If you want to restart restart, and if they aren't happy screw them. If you don't want to restart because of someone new then they can join your already started world and be happy with it. Restart this time for yourself and refuse to restart again for anyone else. This is your world."
cmmap1,"YTA. It was unnecessary to tell him that. You could have just said that you were hoping he found a solution to his problem and you’d be there for him if he needed help. 

Instead of that, you basically shamed him for being proud he was able to come forward with his problems at all."
cmmbse,"NTA tbh it's never really great to hear people's complaints about mutual best friends. It just creates a toxicity.
Next time Alice tries to say something just tell her that she needs to talk to Bob about all of this, and worn it out between them because it's not your responsibility to hear what's going on. It also puts you in an awkward position."
cmmciu,"NAH. 

Just like how your wedding isn’t about her, her wedding wasn’t about you. You can uninvite anyone you want. Does it make you an asshole? No. Are your motivations a bit selfish? Yes."
cmmdog,"NTA. While I’m sure your sister would appreciate any and all help, it’s not your child and not your responsibility. It would be a wonderful gesture to stay there and help out even during nights, but you’re going to visit as a family, not work as a night nurse. You’re an adult and can sleep where you like during your visit. 

However since your sister is a new mom, it would be extremely kind to do something nice for her like bring her something she loves for lunch, or offering to watch the baby for a few hours while she naps. That would be a serious blessing to her right now I’m sure."
cmmh9z,"Say it's almost dead next time. NTA. 

You're almost out of smokes, your phone is almost dead, you don't carry cash."
cmmi80,YTA you made your father remortgage his house cause your bum ass is selling crafts out of your house and making excuses to not just go get a job and your kids are stuck in the middle of it all
cmmj5q,"NTA. They're the ones who need to grow up. You're an adult, it's your life, and can choose what to be called, whether it's a nickname or a whole new name. They're being ridiculous."
cmmmtu,"NAH.

Being Russian isn't going to get you into college, but talking about how your immigrant father came to the US to attend this specific universality and how much it has meant to your family could be a good college essay."
cmmp6l,"NAH- but play nice. You’re lease probably doesn’t allow additional people to sleep over half the time, so having your gfs stay away for one week is the price for him looking the other way on that."
cmmq3y,"NTA

WTF?

Why do you guys put up with that shit?

Sorry, but you’re a doormat and you can’t blame her career.  If you’re not being treated with respect then respect it or dissolve it.

Life’s too short."
cmmqfq,"NAH

Your immediate supervisors did what they could to keep you, but it’s not right for you. At least you tried to stick with them. 

also r/careeradvice"
cmms6y,"ESH

She shouldn't have left the cart, but your vigilanteeism was pretty petty."
cmmsou,"Nta 

If she lives there full time, doesnt work ans therefore doesnt contribute toward paying the costs that her living there incurs.... and if she complains that the cleanliness of the house doesnt meet HER standards then there is a very simple solution.... while everyone is at work she can clean it to her standards."
cmmsp6,"NTA

You said some weekends, not all. And even if you were spending all your time doing this, it doesn't sound unhealthy b/c it's about connecting with family, not grinding minecraft obsessively."
cmmvcg,"I am going to say YTA/YWBTA. A minor asshole. If there's no rule, this is just a shitty thing to deal with. I'm sorry that it is happening, but you would be an ass to leave a note."
cmmvg2,NTA - The fact that she lied to you about what the money was for in the first place is a huge red flag. Honestly I wouldn’t expect to see that money ever.
cmmxpo,"NTA.        

You aren’t responsible for taking care of someone’s kid unless you made the promise or if they’re already at your house. That mom and dad sound extremely irresponsible in my opinion if they are wanting to leave their baby with a fever in a friend’s care, even if it is just for a couple hours."
cmn46z,"YTA -  you’re doing it wrong.  Believe it or not, by getting over early, you are the problem, not him.  Go google “zipper merge,” educate yourself, and stop driving like an asshole."
cmn4q4,"NAH. Some people have really strong feelings about the privacy and sanctity of their beds.

If it was ny bed, I would let them, but this is your bed.

Do you guys have an air mattress to set up? Those are so comfy"
cmn8gv,"NTA, free rides over."
cmnh4y,"NTA. She’s taking advantage of you and using her kids to do it. You being a mother yourself, she knows you wouldn’t put them out with nowhere to go. I hate this situation for you. It’s always a lose-lose. Hope things look up for you."
cmnh6p,"NAH - *yet* - if you wait too much longer and let them start making plans thinking you're coming then that verges into asshole territory. If you already feel like this, let them know that it's too pricey for you and that you won't be coming as soon as possible, you never know if they're searching for e.g. AirBnB's for a larger group because they assume everyone is on board."
cmnknh,"I'm gonna go with NAH, cause yeah your wife should ideally wear what makes her feel good, however, that doesn't necessarily mean that everything is appropriate for every occasion, and I don't think that's appropriate for a family party. That being said I don't think it was fair of you to get your family involved - that sounds like it may have been embarrassing for your wife to hear."
cmnmdv,"NTA

Your dad doesn't seem to get how this works."
cmnmwt,"NTA

You were in a situation that you were NOT comfortable with.  You have every right to get yourself out of such a situation.   It was rude of your friends to try and pressure you into something you were not okay with."
cmnnop,"NTA - not at all

If your parents are in good health and able to go on long travels (good for them!), then they're able to set it up so that their bills are paid on time.  You're very generous to help in setting up solutions, but in the end it's their responsibility, not yours. You simply need to shift the moral burden of bill-paying back to them, where it should be."
cmnsl8,"NAH. I think it's reasonable of him to ask, but you'd be within your rights to respond however you see fit. Babies sleep a LOT, it's not really practical for you to plan your (reasonable) activities around other peoples childcare issues."
cmntxt,"NTA

The kid was being an entitled douchebag (especially the eye-rolling part; wtf?) and overstepping boundaries with strangers. 

Pointing a gun (even if it's fake!) in a stranger's face and pretending to shoot is NOT cute or funny. 

It irks me to no end when parents don't hold their children responsible for their shitty/annoying/unwelcome/entitled actions because ""hE's jUsT a ChiLddd!!"" It's BECAUSE he's a child that he should be taught boundaries and common decency NOW, so he (or she) doesn't grow up to be an entitled, obnoxious adult."
cmnz4w,ESH. Refusal to admit your bias and taking offence at this being pointed out is the ultimate in white fragility. He shouldn’t have said what he said. You all suck.
cmo2r4,You were right for telling him to not throw shit when he cant take it. However the way you phrased tbat last sentence about the attention if you said that to everyone including the one frustrated dude. You are the passive aggresive asshole
cmo3xh,"NTA, you were uncomfortable and gave him pause for thought. You were both adults about it."
cmo6qa,"ESH Your friend should have helped you out by approving someone to sublet your room. However, I can understand her reluctance to live with a random stranger you've had to hurriedly choose to make your circumstances better. 


You suck because you are both on the lease. You haven't helped your friend out with $4,000. You've fulfilled your legal obligation to the landlord to pay rent as per the terms of the rental contract. That's between you and your landlord. Not you and your friend."
cmo8n8,"Tell him next time he does it 'look I've told you before that your making people uncomfortable by doing that, next time you do so you're going to get kicked"" maybe that will get him to stop

NTA: He continued to do it after being asked to stop"
cmoaax,YTA. Get therapy and stop using your emotional baggage to justify controlling somebody.
cmocqp,ESH yeah it’s annoying but that would be petty. it feels like you’re getting unnecessarily angry about it - why not park your car and go to your office?
cmodqm,"Your choice, obviously, but to me it seems she is using Jesus as a get-out-of-jail card."
cmoe8e,"YTA - if it had broken on the way home that’s one thing, but I think as you never checked for so long and don’t know when it happened, it’s on you :( sorry buddy"
cmohhn,"YWBTA if it’s store policy she was only trying to do her job. sure it’s annoying having someone peering over your shoulder, but if pieces are going for $2000 i would too"

cmoosj,"Can you put up a note for the drivers that says ""I did not order food, do not ring my bell, check apartment number""?

Edited to add: Your problem is really with the drivers, your neighbors are just ordering food and can't control what drivers do. Stealing their food will then mean you have a problem with them and with the drivers. I'd start by trying to communicate with the drivers first."
cmopq3,NTA. My parents went through a similar thing with their old neighbours whose child was a similar hellion. It soured the relationship because yeah they didn't want to invite them over because their kid was just a mess. They ended up suggesting that they go out to bars every time they wanted to hang out so that the kid couldn't really come. Sometimes you just want to have quality time with your friends without stressing out about their kids messing your shit up.
cmopxz,ESH the only thing worse than making unfair demands is complying and complaining after
cmotry,"Yeah, NTA. I don't care that it's ""just a cake"" you worked hard for it and wanted some gratitude, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that."
cmouco,"NTA- it's your Facebook header, and you don't own those people anything. congrats on the book!"

cmp3kr,The idea that if you bring something to work it becomes company property is absolutely ridiculous.
cmpa54,"INFO. Is it guaranteed you will get the French horn solo?

My band director used to choose seniors for solos himself. No auditioning. Seemed better that way. If you can get the French horn solo I’d stick with that and leave the other to the trumpet player."
cmpal7,"YTA- that is not something you should ever say to *anyone* much less at a job when you are serving in a professional capacity.   
That's a twelve year old's response.  Be an adult."
cmpfh2,ESH.  You are correct neither is ok.
cmpi5x,"NTA but you will certainly look like an asshole to your family members for excluding your sister when they don't know why. 

Your sister's treatment of Jeff is very upsetting. But what do you hope to accomplish by punishing her this way?"
cmpjw6,"YTA (just pushes the boundary from ESH imo)


You had no right to ask her to keep things platonic in the first place. You don't own your brother and he can date whoever he wants. You insist you have no problem with the relationship, but you certainly seem to have talked an awful lot about how she shouldn't be in a relationship with him.


It's wrong that you were lied to, but at the same time, you need to seriously look at yourself and work out why so many people thought they *needed* to lie to you. They weren't right to do it, but what does that say about you? I'm tempted to believe you wouldn't have reacted well if they'd told you from the start."
cmpqzd,"NTA, and quite frankly I'd be annoyed with my partner if she made me feel like an arsehole just because I don't want to waste money on anxiety inducing, shitty holidays."
cmpr1d,YTA. You're treating your girlfriend like a child - withholding 'treats' if she misbehaves.
cmpr84,"NAH. To someone just wanting to learn how to dance, it may not be intimate at all. However to an outside observer (you) it may look and feel very different. I think you both have fair points to be made here, and I don’t think either of you are in the wrong for it. Ultimately I think it comes down to trust. Trusting that your gf really is just in it to learn, and to dance, and not a thing more. I think it is a positive sign that she told you all of this so openly, too."
cmps14,"Yta, is this a shitpost? That's not funny."
cmpub9,"YTA. People speak different languages for reasons that have absolutely *nothing* to do with you, yet you are making it all about you. Them speaking another language is not a sign of danger. Get over yourself."
cmpv42,"YTA. This is like an even shittier version of the bystander effect because you were likely one of the ONLY people present who could have helped her. What if she was attacked? What if her friends were attacked? What if someone was after her? Or she was lost in a foreign country? She could have been in SERIOUS danger and you just fucked off out of lack of motivation and empathy. How would YOU feel if you were in a country where no one spoke English and something awful had happened to you, and the only English speaker in the room decided having fun was more important than whatever was happening to you?"
cmpvhi,"NTA But never let kid's near collector's toys, they don't understand."

cmq3xl,NTA you were assigned the spot and shouldn’t suffer because an adult made a stupid mistake
cmq4vb,"YTA. Once you notice that she was upset, you should have apologized. Instead you teased her for being offended."
cmq524,"I delete my old comments for a reason my friend, I don’t like to be stalked 🌈 🌈 🌈"
cmq8jl,"YWBTA. If you tell him, you ruin the intervention. He won’t go or he’ll be prepared and it won’t have the same impact on him. If you care, keep your mouth shut."
cmq9cr,NTA the friend should definitely help pay for gas and would be nice if they offered to help drive. There’s absolutely nothing wrong asking friend for these 2 things. And if friend refuses on the helping to pay front they are definitely TA.
cmqa3u,"ESH and your poor girlfriend is caught in the middle. Her parents think very little of you and you are proving them right by refusing to meet them. 

Change their minds. Meet them and prove to them that you are a loving boyfriend who cares deeply for their daughter. If you make the effort you will not be the asshole."
cmqiir,"This is really sweet, makes a change!

I don't think it's manipulative if you're not manipulating her, ya know? You're just trying to give her a good experience and support her in something she enjoys. No harm in that.

NAH."
cmqj1x,"NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA

Your mental health is just as important as - and is clearly impacting - your physical health. You are not the same person as your coworkers; you need to prioritize your own needs. And you don't owe your employer the whole, entire truth and backstory when calling off. You were legitimately sick to your stomach, you just also had a lot of other things going on that your employer isn't entitled to know.

Turn the phone off outside of work or at the very least have half an hour of totally-unplugged time before bed. Prioritize caring for yourself when you're off the clock.

Taking a day off is not ""taking a mile."" It's taking an inch. I promise. You deserve to rest."
cmqk9f,"YTA you dont ""deserve"" to keep your ex-roomates security deposit. She paid rent for the remaning months on the lease and even offered to pay utilities. If she made a post about this situation asking  WIBTA for leaving I would say no. As you said it was become a unhealthy enviorment for both of you,  

>she was (and still is) much more privileged financially than I am. 

You are using this to think it wont affect her if you dont give her back her half of the security deposit. It does not matter if she is richer than you, it does not mean you can take her money. 

Finally if you really are sad that your relationship with her ended as you say in the post. Then returning her half of thr deposit money is a good start to making amends."
cmqlpo,"This one is hard. I get your PoV; you're not doing what you were promised, and that does suck. You were basically lied to (or at least mislead) and aren't having a good time.

At the same time, it is an ass move to make things worse for everyone else. They are taking you on a vacation after all (it just sucks you went with the less enjoyable one to you and were mislead to do so).

I would say the biggest ass here is your dad & stepmom. If your mom had an annual tradition, it is pretty much an ass move to schedule right on top of it.

I don't see the situation being better by moping around, so if you can do your best to just go with the flow, it might make it a little better.

Edit: grammar, autocorrects"
cmqlu2,"YTA.  They're his wedding photos, and he's right, if you didn't want her to be in photos you shouldn't have had her be the flower girl.  

On the whole, you're allowed to say that you don't want photos of your daughter online.  You're allowed to on most occasions ask people not post photos of her.  But he's right in this case.  If a bridesmaid didn't want her photos posted, it'd be ridiculous.  If she was part of the wedding party in any way, you agreed to her involvement and arguing with your brother to the point you're not speaking with him then your issues have far outstretched the problem. 

You could also suggest that he not tag her or mention her name in any photos posted publicly."
cmqn2u,"NTA your mother doesn’t sound like she’s making rational decisions. Even beyond the house, she’s in a terrible situation and needs help. 

It you can pursue power of attorney based on the fact she’s not being taken care of properly, I would go that route. She’s not eating properly which is putting her life (diabetic) at risk."
cmqn6v,"NTA but your issue isn't your brother, it's your mom. It sounds very much to me like he learned his cruel and destructive behavior from her. I highly recommend finding a way to move out as soon as possible for the sake of your mental health. I hope you're getting treatment for your ED as well."
cmqowt,"NTA

I feel like I don't really need to explain this, but just to affirm your choice, I will.

Going no contact is usually the best thing that ever happens to adult children of narcissists and abusers. It is incredibly freeing emotionally, physically, and psychologically.

You were abused. You do not owe the person who abused you anything. At all. Abusers often appear to change their behavior simply to appease their victim and regain control, and then slip back into the same patterns again.

Stay away from her. You deserve to recover from your trauma. Maybe after some therapy and healing on your end, you can attempt a relationship again. But it sounds like things are still too raw for you to make this work in a way where you won't be opening yourself up to more abuse."
cmqs8c,"NTA. Not sure why you're still friends with him. If he says publically that he ""wish he was invited"" state publically that he was invited and refused to go of his own accord."
cmqtbo,NTA - Your dad was just angry that he was woken up and didnt want to deal with the argument then.  He will likely cool down today and be able to focus on your sister.
cmqthe,NTA.  *Backseat Driver* is a trope at this point.  Obvious asshole is GF.
cmqvhm,"NTA, 
he’s 1, of course she should be watching him. Honestly, he shouldnt be allowed to roam the house anyway. that’s super dangerous for a young kid. I’d suggest maybe getting a lock, or using it if you have one.

typo edit"
cmqwkv,....then why did you call it your sister's food?
cmqxuv,NTA at all.  I would practice you're approach so you're firm but not too harsh (try the STAR method).  Revving of the engines of their bikes after 10PM has to stop.
cmqxyi,"NTA
If your husband wants him out of daycare while you try and clean he better also clean too."
cmr1nw,"YTA - and I don’t know the cultural perspective of this but from where I come from what you’ve done is deny a girl who values you  your friendship. 

If that dude is jealous of another guy talking to her this much, it probably means he would be unable to function in a relationship. Is she never to have male friends? You are victimising her for no reason."
cmr1rf,"YTA - Parents who decide to flip the switch at 18 are cruel. 18 is completely arbitrary; you should be helping him gradually work toward independence based on his maturity and capability, not just deciding that a random date is when he stops being your responsibility. Slowly weaning him from financial dependence instead of dropping him into the deep end will result in a much healthier adult child and a much better relationship in the long run."
cmr1yq,">""I'm sorry everyone, my mom just likes drama.""

Yep. So sad. Her 12-year-old kid has her number. 

NTA."
cmr3c6,"YTA for two reasons:

**One:** you basically stole from her by taking her money for something you didn’t pay for. But the much bigger issue is:

**Two:** Three years... *three years.* So you were 23 dating a 17 year old? What the fuck dude, that’s borderline predatory behavior. I’ve got $10 that says you’re not just taking advantage of her financially and that you’re also a controlling creep."
cmr7l9,NTA. you worded your reasoning perfectly and i wouldn’t want to spend my romantic getaway with other people either. your friend is being very unfair
cmr8f5,NTA. I wouldn't talk to them either after that. They sound insufferable to me.
cmr8s1,"NTA - The kid's parents are the asshole for letting their child just roam the neighborhood. Your mom is the asshole for not taking the child home and talking to her parents. People saying you're the asshole seem to be thinking this child *lives in your home* when she doesn't. It is super, super weird for a random neighborhood child to just be allowed to wander your home unsupervised.

edit: Just wanna are that everyone saying “I wandered the neighborhood when I was a kid!” probably have zero frame of reference for how safe it is for an eleven year old TODAY."
cmrb03,"NTA, shit costs money so he gotta pay"
cmrb0w,YWBTA ask around the office first and see if someone has one you can borrow
cmrdmb,"NTA - it was an underhanded comment yes, but 2 years of the snide comments will only get him so far, he tried playing with feathers and got his arse tickled . It's a shame he's resentful of you for it but it really isnt your problem and/or fault."
cmre77,NTA. Your dad is being shady AF. Do not trust him and do what you can to secure you and your mother’s security.
cmre9o,"NTA

I would give him the price of the ticket.  He made the choice to risk a fine without consulting you, so you're not responsible for it."
cmrgcf,ESH fighting over who sits in front? How old are you guys?
cmrhyf,"NTA - A iPhone 8 *is* a high end phone. Get the kid a Nokia brick next time and see if he appreciates an iPhone after that.

Edited because mornings without coffee are hard."
cmrjdn,NTA u are just trying to keep the peace tell them to sort out their problems privately
cmrkrn,"NTA but your family is for expecting you to drive two hours to a lobster dinner you can't eat. 

If they're not willing to make the effort to accommodate your dietary restrictions (in place for serious medical issues!), why should you make the effort to drive down there?

Offer to host them, and prepare only food that is safe for you to eat."
cmroaw,"NTA 

I think that the reaction of your family is extremely rude. You never said that you want money, or that you have any other demands. You simply want to understand. Denying someone this in such an important matter because they don't want to face uncomfortable questions is very pejorative."
cmrr9p,NTA. You don’t owe anyone your time or attention.
cmrsdc,"YWBTA. She asked you so it’s clearly important to her that you go. I understand the anxiety, but I think this is one you shouldn’t miss."
cmrsdo,"DO NOT SEND THIS

As a fellow engineer: the engineering world is small. DO NOT SEND THIS. It could get you FIRED and make it harder for you to find a job. It sucks but is the reality of the engineering world. 

Print a complaint to HR every! single! time! he does something like this. Sign it. Date it. Scan it. Put it in a Google drive. Make a printed copy. Give the original paper copy to HR personally by hand. There’s your paper trail. Keep reporting this behavior IN WRITING. 

(EDIT: As someone else said, send the copy to HR via certified mail so they have to sign for it and acknowledge it happened.) 

Contact a lawyer after 3 such incidents. Ask the lawyer to help draft any further complaints.

EDIT2: I highly recommend going to /r/legaladvice too"
cmrtus,"ESH, y’all need to grow up."
cmruyu,"NTA, you're 15 and your mom sounds a little crazy."
cmrwyf,"NTA, Imagine your ex texts you ""happy birthday!""  and you reply, ""who is this?"" Instant drama that could've been avoided by their name popping up"
cmrwys,YTA. Sounds like you want to get rid of the kid.
cmrxwz,"ESH, her for being rude and not paying attention and you for not just saying something like ""you don't seem interested so i'm going to go"" vs lying about an emergency 

>so I got my mum to arrive and say there was an emergency and we went home. I left before our food got there and told her I wasn't interested. 

I'm confused, so which was it, because these are two different ways of ending the date? Or both?"
cmry8n,"NTA.

Guys don't ask girls out for drinks to be friends.

And girls who are faithful to their boyfriends don't make plans with other men in secret. 

*air drops several pallets of red flags."
cms15f,[deleted]
cms35h,"YTA you willingly moved into that area without doing any research, then when something does not benefit you, you complain."
cms4cy,"NTA. 

It's fine if your Mom wants to do things to help out this girl out, but DO NOT get sucked in to this girls problems or start taking her places. It would be totally inappropriate and, being that you are a man, could lead to some pretty darned awkward situations. Your GF has every right to be upset and think this is really weird.

Your Mom has chosen not to drive. That is completely her choice, and it commendable that you are helping her by driving her around. But, she needs to understand, and you need to very firmly tell her, that helping her is the very limit of your personal capacity."
cms4vo,NTA He could not take the first clear no and the hints and obvious answers afterwards. It is not on you to keep insisting no when he cannot understand what consent or social cues are.
cms5jr,"NAH

Talk to your bf about it, sounds like you're both reasonable people.  If you both trust the friend to watch the dogs then no conflict. Why should you have to stay home alone, when all this free time suddenly opened up?

Not sure if finances play into this but since you didn't mention it, I assume it's a non-issue."
cms5xr,"NTA - the mother sounds like a pain in the ass, and she certainly hasn’t appreciated all the help you have given her so far! It would be easy to say call her bluff and tell her to get another sitter, but then you risk her following through with it and then not seeing your god child"
cms64f,"NTA. That sounds like your girlfriends insecurities, nothing to do with you. It's a kind gesture AND was directly in front of your girlfriend. She is being completely irrational about it."
cms65z,"NTA. there's nothing worse than people feeling they're entitled to your art. you know what your art is worth, and you need to enjoy what you make. and if you were going to do it for free, they definitely should not be pressuring you. if they want art so bad, they can comission it."

The circumstances may change depending on what you are on parole for..."

cmsec3,YTA - You're punishing your SO for allowing her child to have a supervised relationship with her other parent.
cmsflt,"NTA, but the problem was the 20 min wait and not the 5 minute sendoff. They should've stopped booking appointments long enough to get that done"

At 16, he's old enough to know not to do that shit (and the other kids for wanting to break in and play as well). Press ahead with your threat if nothing changes!"
cmsmmc,"NTA, but take a hint

> some of our mutual friends just avoid the topic when I bring it up  

It's not about whether you're right or wrong to them. It's about whether they want to be involved in your drama, and they don't!"
cmsn87,NAH. You should probably have an honest conversation with her about your concerns and work on creating appropriate boundaries with her.
cmsoef,"YTA. You're right, the girl is very classy and you can take a lesson from her.

You made a shitty first impression."
cmsoy2,"YTA. I'm a recovering addict myself. Addicts who are using tend to be incredibly self absorbed. We like to think we deserve sympathy and that our situation is special and we have a good reason to be the way we are. But truthfully, those are all just excuses we tell ourselves to justify our drug use . Your friend was feeling hurt and frustrated that you started using again and that absorbed most of your life and you became more selfish and couldn't take the time to ask about her life. I've done the same thing to my best friend, it happens all the time with addicts. She later felt bad for lashing out and tried to apologize but you didn't let her and that's really shitty. You should apologize to her for letting your actions hurt her and get in the way of your friendship."
cmsp0k,"YTA - You've agreed to meet a group of friends at a restaurant, but have turned up super late (at the point that people had finished eating).

In fact, you're not just late, you've turned up 10 minutes from the end. That's almost more assholery then not turning up at all.

If me and my friends had gone out and ordered a platter for 8 poeple, expecting 8 of us to be there, and one guy bails, we'd be pissed with having to pay the extra between us.

If that guy shows up 10 minutes from the end, eats the food we'd saved for him, and then expects not to pay, we'd be doubly pissed.

From their POV, they've all gone out for a group dinner, waited for you, then got the food order in, expecting you to turn up at some point. They've even saved you some of the food just in case. You've used the word ""scraps"" to make it seem worse, but in their words - ""we saved you a pretty good amount and you ate it anyway"""
cmss6r,"YTA

> I introduced them anyway.

Yeah, pretty much here is where you took the wrong turn.

> I never told him of my idea.

Oh gets worse."
cmssuy,"NTA dude anyone who has a breakdown bc someone who said NO to them about dating is a red flag for potential stalker, it would be insane to let that person live w you.

My best friend has lived with almost all his other close friends and has always refused to consider me. I respect that. Just bc we are close doesnt mean we would make great roommates and he is under no obligation. Friends respect boundaries."
cmstny,NTA and find a new doctor. Good providers will always explain things before moving forward.
cmsv5u,YTA. They’re friends. She isn’t your girlfriend. He isn’t telling you details because he is respecting their friendship. It is none of your business. She can do as she pleases.
cmt0a1,"I was sad and said fuck it and went to GameStop to explain and buy the Switch back hopefully for what they gave him. 


He lied. He said he got $150 out of it but he got $230. 

The employees were kind and sympathetic towards me as I was emotional from feeling manipulated and sold the Switch and Zelda to me for a discount of what they bought it from him for with permission from their district manager. I luckily got there before hey even got to clear the console and package it because they were very busy so my profile and everything is still on there. 

I'm going home and telling him to pack his stuff. Something as small and pathetic as a video game console unraveled into lies over money when he owes me money and I was already trying to be kind and help him out. 

Thanks for your opinions anyways guys. I appreciate it."
cmt22i,Wow you’re only 21 and you’ve already dated enough men and women to constitute a representative sample of the entire population. Impressive.
cmt2zf,"NTA, I honestly dont have a clue what I would do in that situation, and probebly end up doing the same thing. 

Somewhere I feel like you should ev done something, but it cant be expected of you. Its simply and incredible shitty situation which is hard to deal with. I dont think there are many who would do something about: dont give yourself a hard tike for it."
cmt5zt,"NTA. There's no way of feelings not getting hurt, but don't ruin your own vacation and bonding time with your mom over this."
cmt6f6,"NTA
Your mom has massively stomped on your right to privacy.
Also from what you described of her I'm pretty sure r/raisedbynarcissists is the sub for you."
cmt73q,[deleted]
cmt8xw,"NTA. It's so annoying when parents tell their kids who to hang out with. Kids can pick their own friends, good for you for not forcing him to spend time with someone he doesn't want to. Your husband is wrong."
cmtdw0,NTA - You told him you were excited about the anniversary well in advance.  He was totally aware that it meant something to you.  He dropped the ball.  You're not being high-maintenance.
cmthdw,"Yes, YTA! Mrs Piggy is a character with a TON of nasty qualities. She was basically created for the audience to HATE HER. Oh sure in some twisted way she's a ""strong female character"", but she's not just a literal pig. She's overbearing, abusive, easily offended, snotty, full of herself, refuses to take no for an answer, and is she even Kermit's girlfriend half the time? When I was a kid I thought she was just a stalker and Kermit hated her too."
cmthgv,"OP, mental illnesses aren't solved through coddling. They're solved through firm and consistent boundaries. Look up Jonathan Haidt's work. CBT is the best solution the psychological community currently has, and it's the opposite of coddling.

Your aunt sounds like a whiner, but what worries me is that you think supporting her means appeasing her.

NTA"
cmthr6,YTA. You are a grown ass man you can say no to snacks.

cmtktl,"YTA




stop kissing ass and mind your own business"
cmtmhv,"NTA. You are not obligated to speak to anyone you don't want to, family included. I would tell him off if he starts whining (that is what he is doing) again. If you don't want to put up with it anymore, stop taking his phone calls. After all, he stopped taking yours. Once again, you are an adult, you can talk or not talk to anyone you want."
cmtnhe,"NTA

But honestly your girlfriend's story seems a bit fishy. She's attracted to this guy, she's saved his number, she's getting fired for accomplishing too much....at a tea shop?

I just have a feeling this is maybe like 60% of the whole story"
cmto8s,"NTA, she deserved to be called out. You’re nicer than I would have been."
cmtroi,"YTA, dogs dont understand punishments if it's not immediate. Ignoring him the rest of the day? He's not gonna connect that to earlier behavior"
cmttbv,"NTA I’ve been the child watching my mother go through miscarriages. Some we knew about and some my mother kept secret so that we didn’t have to go through that pain again. If my sister was really out there alive, I would want to know. They may cool off and give their mother another chance, but it seems as if the relationship was strained already."
cmtucr,NTA great defense on the spot. Become a lawyer lol
cmtw0h,"YTA. You asked and they gave their input. And so much can go wrong with connecting flights — it can be a real hassle. Safe travels.

Edit to add, I may be biased. We missed our connecting flight and had to spend a night in a hotel, which derailed plans and cost so much more than the savings from not taking the more direct option. (I am the asshole when that story is told for trying to save $150.)"
cmtwv3,NTA.   Seems like a perfectly acceptable course of action to me.
cmtx0d,"NTA. What the hell. This is preferential treatment toward your siblings, plain and simple."
cmty7b,"NAH i see where she is coming from, since it is a bit greedy, but no harm no foul and you did him a favor."
cmtyb1,Idk why you think it's ok to speed just because other people are doing it; your driving sounds awful.

cmu0fq,"ESH. If he can watch porn, he can have preferences. He’s still TA for having double standards"
cmu1ww,NAH they left a polite note and you stopped parking there
cmu3ao,I feel like if your roommate is paying half the bill he shouldn’t be able to have people over whenever he wants. They do need to respect your work hours and be quiet when your sleeping though. NAH
cmu3gt,"NTA chalk up the $15 to storage fees and be done with it. (i.e. don't give the $15 dollars back, your friends actions cost him this amount.)"
cmu4ep,You're not an asshole for not wanting to share a glass... But implying that your son or his girlfriend has some sort of STD (or similarly transmitted thing) you'd be picking up off a glass definitely makes YTA.
cmu4i7,YTA. You told a girl that she reminded you of a character people find unpleasant who I assume in a sitcom is often the butt of many a joke. How would that be anything but insulting?

cmu8dc,"NTA. No one is entitled to your money, especially if you’re still young. A deal was made, and you are doing well for yourself. That doesn’t change the deal."
cmu97i,"NTA. The dude took advantage of your grandma's lack of knowledge when it came to phones and even though he legally did nothing wrong, thay guy is a major asshole for doing so."
cmu9fq,NTA- I say that because it’s possible she wasn’t cheating and you were not sure
cmudml,"NTA. I like when people compliment me on my Scottish accent, but I HATE when people repeat words after me thinking it's cute. It's not. As long as you're not being rude then no problems."
cmueh9,NTA - your uncle sounds like a piece of work and your mom seems to be enabling his shitty behavior.
cmuhpp,"NAH

Be prepared to lose friends over this rule though; you're not TA for bot wanting the responsibility of inviting kids over, and neither are they if they choose not to associate with someone who doesn't want their kids around, ever."
cmuide,NTA. She seems very inconsiderate. She's the definite asshole. I would have been way more mean.
cmuigu,"ESH. 

You, because this lesson is impacting customers. Strange that this has gone on as long as it did. Your partner for your entire post. Printing a ticket is not hard and if it’s your job, there should be some consequence for failing to."
cmuirm,NTA Sell the car tell her to use public transportation.
cmul87,"YTA. I don't think the issue is so much whose mom saw the baby first, but rather how the decision was made... You took the opportunity of your wife being wiped out from a 40 hour labor and delivery to make a unilateral decision to introduce your newborn to a relative without her. At the very least, she missed seeing the first time your child's grandmother held the baby and that's a bummer.  It's also super disappointing that you decided to just make your first decision as a parent unilaterally rather than as a family after your wife had time to rest.

ETA:
Plus, you agreed in advance that your mom would not come to the hospital and then went back on that while your wife was recovering!

AND I'll probably get downvoted for this, but in my opinion, there should be some additional weight given to the desires of the parent who carries the child and goes through the 40nhours of labor and delivery...at least for the first few days...."
cmumvq,"NTA

You can't help people who don't want to help themselves, and this wasn't your JOB. You were trying to give him a hand and he didn't take it seriously; you're entitled to your time and how you use it."

cmup4t,"NTA, a company phone seems appropriate for this situation."
cmupof,"NTA. Based on only the title, people are not entitled to be invited to personal events simply because they are related to you."
cmupop,"YTA, she was over served. It's you're job as a bartender to analyze situations, and know when to cut people off. It's an error of judgement and you didn't do your job."
cmuq21,NTA. Sounds like its time for Jeff and Katie to move out.
cmuqfn,NTA - his lease ended and he left his stuff that was his responsibility. They probably will even charge him for the extra effort of clearing it out.
cmurbi,NTA. You did what you had to do. I hope this doesn't ruin future prospects with girls (if she's a blabbermouth). Best of luck from another bisexual!
cmurhu,"YTA.  People don’t want to hear what you are watching or listening to on your phone.  Having any sound on in a public place is rude.  Not only that, but you were watching a popular show that other people enjoy.  You totally ruined it for them."
cmury7,"NAH But I honestly understand her. She's in a different country and she has no close friends. She's probably losing her mind, it's not surprising she's acting like that."
cmusys,"NTA

The guy using his two children as guilt-trip-barrier is though.

> The guys says ""if you wanted these seats you should have gotten here earlier"" to which my dad replys ""we got here before your family"".

Yup."
cmuucl,"NAH. I really doubt your dad’s new girlfriend meant anything but good by cleaning and organizing your room. Maybe she wanted to score some points with you as the new girlfriend, or maybe she just wanted to straighten the whole house.
However I get why you’d be upset by it, a bedroom is rather personal and I especially would not like someone I don’t know going through it. It’s a little weird she would not ask permission first, but give her a chance; she probably didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable."
cmux65,NTA. That person is toxic to have in your life.
cmuxqf,NTA. Do NOT have children until you guys are on the same page.
cmuzvr,"There is more to this story OP. You don't get fired from a six figure job for not being able to provide a receipt. I would recommend you ask your Mom for more information before you wade into a situation I don't think you know a lot about.

NAH."
cmv0r3,"NTA

They aren't entitled to your friendship. They hurt you and made fun of you and you walked away, that should have been the end of it."
cmv1ii,"YTA - either be open an honest about why you're excluding them or be open an honest about yourself.

What matters more? winning a few more games or involving people who enjoy the sport even if they arent good.

I assume these people are adults which can handle criticism, and if you're honestly trying to push the team better why not give them some incentive to practice more?

But tbh, be honest with yourself are you in it for the fun or are you in it for the competition? There's solutions you're avoiding."
cmv3un,"NTA.

Four adults plus a newborn sharing a bathroom sounds like a bad time. As long as there is no financial conflict, they should get a hotel room."
cmv46n,"NTA

You are married, she won, why bother asking your partner to throw away an old photo that isn't even relevant anymore."
cmv4aj,"NTA

Also, I have the same problem in my house, so I can relate."
cmv4wt,"YTA this is some incel level entitlement and all around asshole behavior. You couldn’t have her, so nobody in your friend group can be with her. Not only that but you made clear the only way she can still see you is if she dates you. That’s a really shitty thing to do to someone."
cmv5du,">Not to mention that she is hundred of thousands in debt

NTA.

Dear god talk to your father! Her behaviour shows more red flags than a communist parade in Beijing. 

Your dad is a doctor or something similar right? She sounds like a gold digger who wants him to help carry her debt. Yelling at him is bad enough already, doing it infront of his patients might damage his practice."
cmv5vq,"  His PTSD is probably cured after 11 years of cuddling with the first dog-

YTA for this statement alone. I wont break the civility rules for telling you where to go and what to do with yourself once you get there."
cmv9ei,NTA. This sounds like the IRS scams but on paper instead of over the phone.
cmvb07,"NTA - She's actively spreding false information and you're trying to educate her. If she doesn't want to be embarassed then maybe she should learn some things about the world.

No one likes a ""well actually..."" person all the time, but it's just straight up slander if she's gonna call them nazis."
cmvb1j,"NTA. Bride and groom should have had the wedding party’s rooms booked prior to invited going out. Poor planning on their part. 

Nice if you to give up your room, fair of you to not go if you’re stuck in a crappy motel."
cmvdk1,"NTA. She asked, you answered. I assume you did so in a relatively polite way, in which case you're fine."
cmvepl,"YTA If you ""raised his rent whenever I had to clean up after him"", yes. Just flat out tell him he needs to start paying rent (or tell his brother). Don't clean up after him. Tell his brother to clean up after him. If neither of them do, kick the freeloader out."
cmvhux,YTA as an adult now you are not entitled to a dime they make they can chose to help you and pay but are by no means reasonable  to pay

Your boss is thinking that if a resident's family member saw this and misconstrued the situation he could have a liability issue."
cmvped,"NTA. It’s your wedding and your mom is acting childish and manipulative. If she wants to fork over some financial assistance to cover food costs, maybe it would change something but it doesn’t sound like that’s happening. If her best friend shows up anyways, or she brings her or whatever, you should probably have a plan in place to deal with that."
cmvqal,"I don’t think they would see it as being ungrateful if it was on purpose and they would definitely be appreciative of you asking if it was a mistake.

cmvuyl,[deleted]
cmvwsi,"NTA. 

She is way out of line, in my opinion, for even asking to bring her dude on a stated girls trip. But she is even more out of line for getting offended that you want him to financially contribute. You split the total based on X bodies, now there are Y bodies. The total should be split accordingly.

People can act poorly when they are in a new relationship. They don’t get that not everybody is as excited about it as they are."

cmw3o1,"If I'm reading and understanding this correctly, you sent her an image of the bride and said the bride looks like her ""type.""  Is this correct?

If so, that's a really weird thing to say considering the bride just married your mutual colleague.  It comes across like you're trying to set up your friend or something.  So I get why your friend is weirded out, but I do think she responded too harshly and took it really seriously.  So I'm torn on judgement.  If you are an asshole, you're less of an asshole than her."
cmw4f4,NTA and as a long time veteran of the high end service industry I applaud you.
cmw4qj,"YTA but not a bad one. You spend most of the working week around these people and in this office, it's good manners and common courtesy to bend a little to the existing working culture and saying hello/goodbye is (in my opinion) the bare minimum anyone should do in a workplace. This isn't your ""social life"", this is your professional life and sometimes you have to make little concessions like this. I don't like having conversations first thing in the morning but a breezy ""morning!"" as I scoot on by to my desk is not enough of an opener to start a casual converstion but it's still a friendly greeting to everyone.

Also, you might one day need help or a favour from the people you work with and people will be a lot more willing to do so if you've got a somewhat positive rapport with them."
cmw5b6,"NTA

The husband is...or maybe ""was""... like you said, its been 5 years since he last tried to be inappropriate with you.

cmwn39,"ESH. I'd say NTA because it seems that your father is the one that's out of control. From the little that you've told us about him he seems like a control freak who doesn't respect boundaries. 

However, if I read correctly, you used HIS money to both buy the plane ticket and get the Airbnb. That makes you TA as well. You knew you were making this move, you should have saved for it to do it all by yourself. Otherwise you were planning to live in a foreign country on your parents money until you got paid. That's a risk and it's no wonder he'd think you weren't prepared; he was right. What are you going to do if he cuts off the credit card and calls Airbnb to report a fraud?


Maybe I'm missing something, but that's how I see it from what's posted. What does your mother have to say about this?"
cmwn41,NTA you can’t ask for someones opinion and only accept one answer.
cmwphn,"NTA

I think your title kinda skims over the meat of the issue here, which is

>I think it's a lot of money to spend on a holiday by himself with work colleagues. Especially as it may mean we can't afford a decent holiday together for another X amount of years because of the expenses.

If it's a financial burden and you guys don't get to go on trips normally, it's just plain unreasonable for him to plan an impromptu trip or suggest he go on one alone.

The coworkers issue is beside the point, even if he was going entirely alone he'd be TA

Also the higher her sugars are, longer, the more she risks diabetic complications such as foot ulcers, circulatory compromise, retinal damage, etc. maybe talk to her at home, it almost sounds as if she’s shy about taking her meds at school. High school is different, she wants to fit in. She wants to eat the same foods, and not be seen giving herself insulin shots. If she won’t listen to you, maybe it’s time for a visit to her endocrinologist or diabetes educator. Complications from diabetes are no joke."

cmx3z7,"NTA. You verbally transferred care to (presumably) a similar level of training or higher. You asked, she agreed. She probably caught grief from her charge/supervisor and thats why she was coming after you. That said, if youre good to take lunch, I’d say you’re good to leave the pt. If not, not. But that’s on her to refuse; NTA."
cmx6ot,"NTA. Your coworker is a dick. Also, go to HR for the retaliation as well."
cmx6ul,NTA - and no it's not normal parenting behavior if she has to isolate you to be in the right about something that's a huge red flag
cmx7f5,"She may need to figure this one out on her own.

You can try to explain this to her, but she is likely to get defensive and mad at you. 

I’d mention it once and then drop it until she comes to you for help when she inevitably realizes he’s married."
cmx91f,"NAH she offered and you accepted; you didn’t force her to get up.

Also, I want to know why she thinks she can’t sit straight in a dress... (edited to indicate she wasn’t TA either)"
cmxazd,"NTA. You have a right to know before you share finances, obviously before you get married."
cmxbld,"NTA only psychos act pleased when they crush the life out of something that isn’t a bug, and even sometimes when it is a bug."
cmxbon,"NAH, but i would NOT call it an LGBTQ party unless a majority of the guests are LGBTQ. If it’s only straight people it seems like you just want a party."
cmxcmc,YTA. Sounds like she should correct her relationship status.
cmxdfi,"Roses are red

Violets are blue

He's an asshole 

And so are you"
cmxise,"NTA

That is really funny.  You effectively showed them things shared online are public and anyone can see.  They didn't get offended, nor in trouble."
cmxj4z,[deleted]
cmxjib,NTA I had a cat with asthma and a herpes virus who needed three meds by mouth daily. I know the struggle. It seems to me that your mother doesn't give a damn about your cat.
cmxm2o,This is just very odd. Nah.
cmxoi3,NTA.  Your dad is an abusive one though.
cmxr07,"YTA - she's absolutely right, you only wanted to hang out with her when it involved her doing something to benefit you. If you really didn't want to go to the store you could have tried to negotiate to go see a movie or something else out of the house that would be fun for both of you. On the other hand if you had tried that and she had refused, it would be Everyone Sucks Here for not compromising."
cmxtbo,"ESH. You know you're being fidgety and continue to spill because of your inattentiveness. She seems like she is over reacting to this, but who knows if this is the first thing you've done to annoy her. Both of you sound like you just need to address what's actually bothering each other."
cmxvej,"NTA. He can be into what he wants to be into. You can opt out of the relationship if it disturbs you. 

His silent treatment for you asking about history he left visible isn’t fair or nice. You aren’t the one who is at fault here. Other people are saying you “snooped” but if you typed in one letter and got that - I wouldn’t consider that snooping at all. If he was okay with his kink, he’d be open about it."
cmxwqw,"NAH

The person hoped you would sit in the middle but did not protest when you did not. You acted politely throughout."
cmxwxn,"NTA
They can’t force you to participate. And the fact your parents are already trying to get you to change how you look makes them TA. If you really don’t want to be in it, then refuse to be in it. I doubt they want a member of the wedding party looking miserable for all the photos."
cmxx1i,"NTA, but I think you should have understood from his replies that (for whatever reason) he wasn’t comfortable texting and was just okay with polite talk when you saw each other"
cmxxq3,Absolutely report her. People suffer every day because people sit by and let people get away with shit. Don't let her get away with it. NTA. You have to do the right thing.
cmxzzt,"NTA, the boyfriend should have to sleep on the couch."
cmy2wo,"NTA
Your response is perfectly reasonable. You helped them out greatly, and they repay you by not paying you what was promised and ghosting you when you try to contact them. If you get rid of the stuff, it’s entirely on them."
cmy405,"NAH

How is a simple question making a mountain? Seems pretty reasonable, I know my roommate and I always ask if the others done with the bathroom in the mornings"
cmy546,YTA there was no need to mention her at all in the first place. Dick move
cmy7a6,"NTA

Sounds like 20 yo girl who has never been told 'no'. Your mom is the proof."
cmy81x,"YTA That's just plain harsh, isn't there like a girl code or something? You all should have relocated, never leave a friend out.

EDIT: Spelling (shout to should)"
cmy9j7,"NTA.
She's your Dad's ex but your Mom. You spent way more time with her than he did and I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with what you chose.
I'm sorry for your loss."
cmybik,"Honestly your story was a little hard to follow but it seemed like you were the asshole. Mostly because your mom should take priority over your friends. Also though because you said you had already been home all day playing video games. 

I think you should have gone with a ""Hold on, can I just finish up this match?"" or something and then spent the time with her."
cmybj0,NTA For wanting to go out for breakfast. Seems like you were the only one to speak up until the person organizing it made a stink and everyone else decided to jump on board with your good suggestion.
cmyc34,"NTA - I commend you for admitting part of you wants to do it out of pettiness. However - she’s taking time out of her life to help this guy who isn’t appreciative of her efforts AND she may be working with a guy who is saying incredibly racist things about her. Sure - maybe he’s nice to her in-person, but these personality traits may come creeping out eventually, and she should know now rather than finding out when she’s working with him."
cmydsi,"NAH

i get friend code, and its her ex, but holy fuck

* its been almost 2 years

* thats not inherently wrong (like cheating, or stealing, verabal abuse, etc)

* you're practically a mother to this girl"
cmyekc,"NTA. Not your circus, not your monkeys man. Your SIL had the opportunity to get her house in order, literally, and she failed."
cmyguy,NTA - Your neighbors are idiots for moving into a building where you're allowed to smoke if they don't wanna smell it.
cmyihw," **NTA** 

This relationship sounds so emotionally unhealthy, that even just thinking about it, is causing you stress you don't need. 

just cut all ties with her, she needs to find someone else who can give her snake the attention it needs, and you need to take time and work on yourself."
cmyl4v,"NTA - quite frankly, even though it’s your parents, you’re an adult and your dating life is none of their business. You don’t need a bunch of people in your head telling you what is and isn’t good about someone. Sure - there are some red flags about people you may not see and others will, but what matters most is how *you* feel about someone. So I don’t blame you if you only confide in trusted confidants, which doesn’t sound like your parents."
cmylfp,NTA I guess? But don't agree to do any favors for him next time. What do you possibly have to gain from this?
cmyo06,10 points to Gryffindor.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
cmyomd,"NTA, how could you have known if it was the grandmother or not? And also, you're sure not allowed to detain a child."
cmypm3,"NTA, that’s why you have the option to check the box that says ‘regretfully decline’"
cmyqq1,"NAH

It sounds like it’s something they haven’t really considered, so if you can bring it up to them in a non confrontational way they will likely be on board. I would mention it to just a few select people on the team and see if they can disseminate it from there."
cmyumi,NTA. It is your body. No one else should be able to tell you what you get to be comfortable with.
cmyvkq,"NTA. 
It’s technically “their house their rules”. But that doesn’t mean that the rule makes any sense at all. I’d say go for a hotel, because then you have a place you can escape to for reprieve from the family, and if you get one with a pool the kids will sleep really well after a pre-bedtime swim. :)"
cmyxhv,"NTA. This was no accident.  But also, you learned your lesson regarding letting kids convince you to let them drive it. 

The crazy part of me says you should have told the mom, ""You can either pay for it or else bring back his favorite toy and make him watch while I stomp on it."" 😜 (No, I'm not serious. It would make a great scene in a movie though.)"
cmz0o9,"NTA. If this is a _women's team_, why does someone who doesn't believe they are a woman believe they should also be part of it? Being a man would rule out participating in a women's team."
cmz1kw,Find a random similar one online and forward it on.
cmz5gv,"Info

Did you ever ask them to move it out of the way or did you just directly report it?"
cmz8yy,"ESH. 

You sound as entitled as your sister, expecting to be given a 2nd phone when she has none. She sucks because she's entitled. Your mom sucks because she shouldn't have promised it to you then gave it to her.

Your dad seems the only reasonable one."
cmzccv,"NTA we would never expect our nanny to deal with the tip.

It may have just been something the parents forgot about so if it's important to you then you can say ""I've been meaning to ask, did you want me to write in a tip on the pizza delivery receipt?"" And just see what they say"
cmzcfj,"ESH. He obviously sucked. He probably had some deeprooted incel issues that could've been helped by someone reaching out to him to ask him why he was like that, or more likely, therapy. But it wasn't you or your peers' obligation to tolerate him. That said, there's a difference between seeing him for what he was and cutting him off, and actively bullying him. The bullying probably fed his problem even more."
cmzdmh,"NTA, total invasion of your privacy especially if she admitted to spying on you. If she wants to watch her dog she should put him/her in her room and have the webcam in there."
cmzgo1,"NTA - these bridezillas that think that can have control of their wedding party’s bodies are too much. 

Asking you to wear certain clothes and style yourself certain ways is one thing but they can’t ask you to actually change something"
cmzp6p,NTA. It sounds like you needed to grow a pair ages ago. Why are you letting this couple treat you like a servant?
cmzqbc,NAH. Your not an asshole for thinking of your sobriety first. Maybe decline for the near future but leave the door open for later. Maybe send lily a picture of you and write her a letter instead. It’s only natural she wants to know her bio mom.
cmzqlm,YTA. yeah it's your house but you have a guest over. You don't have to stop being affectionate by no one wants to watch other people making out and groping
cmzs82,"NAH in the truest sense of the word. You're both right - you're entitled to the meal Buffalo Wild Wings actually promised to serve you and nothing less, and this is not a mistake that demands to be addressed. You both should let it go."
cmzuyf,"ESH, your family more than you tbh. Your family sucks for constantly pressing you about finding a girlfriend. Honestly I just hate that cultural double standard that boys are encouraged to find a girlfriend and get laid ASAP but if girls do that (which includes the girls that these boys are in relationships with) they're considered sluts or ""shameful"". Good on you for calling them out on their homophobia and not allowing them to pressure you into making any decisions or being in relationships you may not be ready for. 

But you also suck for pretending to be gay. The LGBT community still has it rough these days so the last thing they'd want is to be used as a prop instead of just, I dunno, standing up for yourself. Judging from your post, that would make you 14 now, so you've gotta start learning to hold your own ground. I'm not saying you should tell them to go fuck themselves or anything, because you're still only 14 and you need to tolerate their shit for at least 4 more years; but you're gonna hit that part of your life (if you're not already there) where you learn that adults are just older children and they can still have some really dumb opinions.

Maybe start picking up the grey rock technique (you can google it, there are lots of resources on this). It's a technique often used against those who are narcissistic or just generally Toxic™. Every time they do this to you, they're looking for a reaction because it's fun for them to see how you react so they can tease you further. Next time they do this, don't give a response. At most, give them a ""hmm"" or as short and dull as a response as you can give (even a simple ""no"", and if they push it asking why, don't respond. You don't owe them details or explanations about your life) and then move onto the next topic as soon as you can. Once you stop reacting to it, they'll get bored of asking and leave it alone."
cmzywl,"NTA
If you want him out, call your lawyer"
cn01vx,"NTA. You are not obligated to spend time with your step sister, it's her parents' job to keep her entertained."
cn02gy,"NTA. I get that it was an honest mistake, but it's pretty shitty that they got mad about him pointing it out. That's a big social faux pas, especially if you make the mistake more than once. They're not assholes for making the mistake, but they should have apologized rather than going on the defense and getting pissed about it."
cn03g1,YTA.  It's not your place and your sister knows most of what you want to say already.  She already let her do it despite knowing this stuff.  Only share your advice or opinions if asked.
cn03lq,"YTA. If you *really* wished to champion the cold-logic take of ""yeah her calling me out was deserved, but she deserves punishment for acting out as an employee *specifically because* employees shouldn't act out like this"", you have to pursue that *after* you're mentally distanced from the severe upset and guilt you felt stemming from ""she called me out and I acted this way"" as opposed to stemming from ""she was an employee and acted out in an inappropriate way"".

Even then, though, that's a really unsympathetic and unfeeling take, and I'd tell you to have some mercy on the girl in these circumstances.

I chose YTA instead of ESH intentionally, and I feel it could be useful for me to elaborate on that. The two major wrongs I'd consider chalking up to the girl would be the harm and robbing of the movie experience she gave OP, which I don't feel is enough against her to make it ESH, and risking her job as an employee, but that's her own risk that she can choose to take for herself."
cn06ox,"yta rules are there for a reason. Because you rode on the trail the park would be liable for any accidents, and being underage certainly wouldn't help their case in court.

I understand why it bothers you but that's a rule you should follow."
cn0cc6,NTA- there's nothing wrong with not liking kids if you can't handle them or don't won't to
cn0cdw,NTA hun you do you
cn0ee2,[deleted]
cn0gjf,"ESH.

I agree with your wife. While it's true that she should be responsible for packing and eating food at 14 years old, you also know that she has potential eating disorder - 14 is old enough to do some things on their own, but not quite old enough to be totally responsible for their own health."
cn0lxy,"“Live like you’re poor”? So you do have the money for it but it’s not in the budget you’ve both allocated? I think NAH, I know you’re trying to live on this strict budget but this is a special occasion, just let her get a new outfit."
cn0m64,"I have come to terms with this already. My salary is enough to support myself and my granddad would be willing to support me in the event of an emergency. My main reason for doing this is I have at times felt what he acts on when dealing with others, and I fear if I continue to have this negativity shifted on me I will begin to exhibit it on others, which is exactly what I don't want. No one deserves to feel like they aren't enough."
cn0ngp,NTA. Clever way to give him the hint that he was disturbing the movie for people (and trust me I understand how bright phones are capable of this) without adding to the problem. Honestly the worst thing I see about this on your part is the risk you took that you'd *miss*.
cn0ogf,"NTA - You told him he could borrow it as long as he was back before 9. So for any time after that, he STOLE it. He deserves to be yelled at for overstepping his bounds. You've been more than a gracious host letting him use your bike as he pleases."
cn0pr8,NTA. Failure to plan on her part does not make an emergency for you.
cn0qkr,"NTA - As a passenger I would not want to fly with someone that crazy. It sucks when someone makes an already difficult and stressful job worse by being unreasonable. While that one person off the plane may be mad, I’m sure the other passengers appreciated the job you did. The fact that you are still thinking about what more you can do speaks to you not being an asshole."
cn0rf0,NTA.  Its your child if you dont want a bunch of people holding them that is your choice. I would just not go to that church anymore if it was me but I understand if you dont want to stop going.
cn0s50,"obv NTA, you are certainly mature enough to decide what to eat since you understand actual nutrition and research better than mom. Welcome to almost-adulthood, when we learn our parents can be wrong AF. 

I have anorexia and I had some real whack ideas about food. In the hospital I met with nutritionists who debunked a lot of that “carbs are evil” etc junk. Its a common problem.  

Part of my problem was food-related abuse from my parents, so I bought my own food with my own money a lot when I was a teen. 

Remember, your mom didnt have the internet, she’s from a different era. She doesnt have the research skills your generation is more likely to develop.  She may not trust authority figures or whatever. We all have our flaws

You could talk to your GP about diet and eating if you have concerns, btw.  

but yea, seeking scientific truth about your own health? Absolutely ok, lol, you aren’t morally obligated to allow someone to keep hold of harmful misunderstandings about health!"
cn0scu,"NTA but I would caution you in the future. If you're the only one who's actually enforcing this rule, you will NOT be very popular among your coworkers (and having worked in the restaurant industry for years before I left for an internship in college, I know how insanely clique-y a restaurant can be)."
cn0u3u,"NTA.

If you specifically told her, in a polite manner, NOT to post photos of you and your child, together, then once should've been enough. The fact that she kept doing so (numerous times) after being told not to, warranted a more stern reaction. She has to respect your boundaries, the time/moments that you spend with your child, and your learning curve of being a parent, without broadcasting it for everyone to see."
cn0u91,"For clarification, does your husband not agree with you selling drugs, or specifically to selling drugs to this guy? 

If it's the latter and the guy pressured you in to doing it anyways 100% NTA, he's being an irate jackass to his dealer. That's just stupid, cut him off.

If you're implying your husband doesn't know about you dealing drugs and it would ruin your marriage if he found out, you should probably come clean about that. You're NTA in this situation but that's a hell of a secret."
cn0uqi,"ESH; your brother is an immature prick and needs to grow up. That said, quit acting like his parent. If his actual parents have a problem with his screen time, let them address it. You using your Netflix as a parenting tool is BS, because A) you aren't his parennt and B)you're playing favorites based on your disagreement with the hobbies that he has. You have every right to not let people use the account you pay for, but the reasoning behind why you won't let him use it is bullshit."
cn0uwf,"It's the entire family's house and they should all be comfortable there. The expectation of simple clothing in a shared environment is a typical convention, but the sister isn't an asshole if she hasn't even been asked yet - NAH."
cn10i8,"A day or two later your wife

Will still be passing large blood clots and doesn't want someone there.

Will be having an ice pack in her mesh underpants or Depends and doesn't want someone there.

Will be squirting water into her crotch when she pees or else it burns and doesn't want someone on the other side of the door.

May not have taken her first poop. Which is gonna hurt. 

Will be making a bloody mess every time she uses the bathroom and doesn't want to worry about someone seeing it.

Will have nurses coming in to check the stitches and/or healing. 

May be trying to get the hang of breastfeeding. It might hurt. It might not be working. It might be going wonderfully but can't get the hang of doing it smoothly and discreetly. 

May have hormones just going nuts. 

May have had a traumatic birth and isn't recovered. 

May have had a wonderful birth and just wants to bask in the glow of her baby without having to clean up and make small talk. 

May not want to hand the baby over, and will feel pressured since her MIL came all this way.

May feel as though she has certain hosting responsibilities and would prefer to have company when she's more up to it 

May have a friend who's mom and MIL engaged in a weird grandma competition and wants to not have them at the same time.

May know that you find it offensive to have your mother come all this way and have to wait, so she doesn't trust that you won't push your mother over the boundaries she wants. 

May have concerns about a woman transitioning into Alzheimer's when she is so vulnerable.

May worry that you will be focused on making sure your mother doesn't feel neglected instead of taking care of your wife and child.

May worry that if your mom is there, you'll push off the responsibility of taking care of your wife and child since there is someone else to do it. 


I doubt it's a power trip. YTA.

If you were trying to better the experience, you could have just asked the woman you were so rude to about busing the table. Better yet you could have just asked for the check and left. You were borderline aggressive."
cn11sr,NTA this is plain out sexual harassment.
cn125g,TL;DR but we've all faked an origami to make our partner feel better. Don't beat yourself up over it.
cn134l,"Yes, YTA, Jesus. She's AN asshole, but you're THE asshole. Posting revenge porn always makes you a shithead."

You are 16 and they should not be coming in your room. Its inappropriate and WTF is up with your mom? Your mom's behavior is very weird. You have a right to be ""sensitive"" about adult males entering your room in the middle of the night."
cn1cz3,"Are they aware that you're seeking treatment and why? If they're unaware they may just be genuinely concerned that you're acting differently, and not realize that it's in your best interest.

Edit after info:

NAH

It wasn't the best choice of your parents to be talking to your brother about you without first directly having a conversation with you. It sounds like they could be concerned and perhaps they were just trying to see if your brother thought similarly. Nonetheless, you still have the right to be upset that they're claiming to know what's going on with you without actually speaking to you. I do agree with another comment though, that some of the phrasing you used does sound a little out of place. Just a friendly reminder that even if all the external factors are on the up and up, it doesn't mean that the internal factors are totally on the same page. I hope you are doing as well as you've stated and you continue to do well. Best of luck."
cn1f2b,"Honestly I didn't start cleaning because I like I it. I did it because at the time I was very depressed, still am, and cleaning was a good way to pass time at work. Maybe a bit of an unexpected, dark twist, but it's the truth."
cn1hmi,"NTA Your wife wants to use you to cut off her ex, and at the same time obligate you to large financial payments for 13-18 years, but all while planning to divorce you.

I feel for the poor girl, but you'd be stupid to go along with your wife's plan.

Tell her you'll still be a supportive dad to the girl (if you're willing), but will not legally adopt her.

ETA: Clarification: Suggesting *emotionally* supportive only. But as replies noted, it's a good idea to check with the lawyer."
cn1jwc,"NTA. 

Not your relationship, not your problem, period. Especially if it involves someone that’s essentially a stranger and could jeopardize your job."
cn1on4,NTA. He gave them to you and your sister. Kid needs to learn that just because someone else gets something doesn't mean they automatically does too. Otherwise he's going to turn into an entitled little brat.
cn1p05,"NTA But you really can be if you just give up on giving that child the care he needs. She can just be really scared at the idea and might be in denial....do I would really go out of your way to help him the kid.

It also can really depend on how you said it or when. Even with good intentions, how the question came up or was worded could have been really offensive."
cn1pia,"NTA, but if you don't hold them to it now that you've made this declaration, you're screwed. If you hold them to account, one of two things will happen, they will either wise up and knock it off, or you will have cut toxic people out. If you do cut them off for behavior, you don't have to completely cut ties (for example, maybe talk to them once a year) but you will need to curtail contact severely. 


If you don't follow through though, they're never going to treat you well."
cn1prn,"NAH, you wouldn’t be an asshole, but do you really want to be such a colossal weeaboo?"
cn1qat,"100% Definitely NTA: WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!  That is like the most normal thing in the world to do and your mom has some hangup, whether it's as you say about your SO, or some weird sexual thing, but either way she's fucking weird. Don't let her tell you how you can show your kid affection. I know teenage children that peck their parents on the lips and it's not weird."
cn1qdh,NTA: you made a mistake and she accused you of doing it on purpose. That's hurtful in the best of circumstances and you were fine telling her how you felt.
cn1rro,"NTA.  It's not extortion to ask for your own money.  Assuming they had agreed to the ticket and lodging prices, they owe you the money.

I'd set a deadline for the first payment, and deadlines for subsequent payments for those who need a little time - or just a single deadline.

Say if they don't intend to go, to let you know, and you'll try to resell their piece.  *If* you can do so, they'll be off the hook.  Say that you assume anyone who doesn't make the first payment isn't intending to go, and you'll sell their tickets to recoup your costs."
cn1tey,"NAH

She made a mistake and offered a way to make amends. As you said it was a substantial amount of food and you're also a poor college student. 

If she made the offer she knows she can afford it so don't feel too bad. Maybe as a sign of appreciation you could cook her dinner with the reimbursed groceries?"
cn1u01,"NTA, both because you're rarely the asshole for your feelings and because you're right. You confided in her and she responded with nothing but disrespect. I doubt you'll get an apology, but you certainly deserve one."
cn1ujg,"NTA, but i always think of that survey regarding VETS and putting animals down
“Asked my vet what the hardest part was about his job and he said when he has to put an animal down,” she wrote.

“90 per cent of owners don’t actually want to be in the room when he injects them so the animal’s last moments are usually them frantically looking around for their owners and tbh that broke me.”

Please stay."
cn1w06,"NAH

You're showing your supportive by going to the first half of her birthday party. Plus you probably shouldn't put yourself in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable, especially if it means missing out on other opportunities. 

Also you're under 21, so you probably won't be allowed into the bars anyways."
cn1wpd,"NTA. It was a petty move, but I like petty."

cn1z55,"YTA because you'd leave your best friend bewildered and hurting during what is supposed to be the happiest time of his life.  

You're well intentioned, but too hard on yourself.  It's okay to only be 90% happy for him.  If you can put on a happy face and support he and Megan, you're being an awesome friend.

Absolutely do not tell him anything about your feelings for Megan, and don't act jealous of his happiness.  You can jovially say, ""Man, I'm a bit jealous of you guys.  I hope someday I find someone I'm that happy with!"""

cn2m52,"YTA. It's alllllmost NAH but I'm saying YTA just to get the point across (especially since enough people here will mark it NAH that I don't think my rating will change the final one much). Jeez man- ""I've got a decent chance of 40 more years with my wife""- is never a good way to think of things. It's highly dismissive of her feelings now, and people usually don't forget feeling dismissed. Your wife should not be forgotten or feel forgotten- you \*will\* definitively regret that.

Plus, if you get 4 date nights a month, that means you're only spending \*one\* date night a month with only your wife? What? I must be misreading, because if that's the case that is definitely a problem and will become a bigger one.

Also, have you asked your daughter about it? Because if she's wanting to do more things on her own maybe she doesn't want you to do this.

Edit: I've been informed that the tallying system works differently than I thought. I'm still going with YTA because I think the wife is more right to be hurt than he is, but again, it's not like a you're the ASSHOLE. More of a ""hmm yeah you're being kind of an asshole""."

She doesn’t out your sister because in her eyes your sister isn’t “lost”. 
If she is bisexual your sister could still end up with a husband and kids. Also many people don’t consider bisexuality “real” (compared to homosexuality).
Your mother and most of your family are homophobic and biphobic assholes.
I wonder what your sister thinks about it. Maybe she is glad for the lack of negative attention, but she could also feel pretty angry because your mom doesn’t seem to take her sexuality serious (in a negative way)."

He needs to get over himself a bit. If I don't laugh during sex, I  consider it a sesh wasted. You can't take sex, or yourself, too seriously.

The best tip I can give you is that people don't really want advice most of the time, they just want you to demonstrate that you care about them by listening. Online, that does mean you have to respond with words, but you can just say things like ""that sounds really tough,"" or ""I'm sorry you're going through this.""

These concerns go beyond just not liking the dress taste-wise.  You even said you like it aesthetically, just not for you to wear. If you say it that way it doesn't really sound bad

I really think bridesmaids should be allowed to wear dresses that are the right type of dress for them.  Pick a color and a few criteria, then let them get a dress that actually works.  But that's just my opinion.

It’s a cute nickname, and as long as you stop doing this before he can understand, you’re fine.

She literally carried this human for 9 months, she’s probably still pumped up with hormones and you’re insulting your baby, who she probably/hopefully feels a whole heap of pride and love over. She’s said she’s not happy with you doing it, so I suggest you stop. There’s plenty of other nicknames out there."
cn67vy,"This is going to be really subjective because it's based on people's oppions on what role parents play in children and development. I personally say if you are financially stable enough to cover the loan, then just cover it and dont bring it up.  This is for two major reasons.

1. It's your education. This isn't your dad paying for something mandatory like your clothes when you were a minor. This is higher education that lots of families cant afford. You should be happy that you can afford an education at all, and your financial stability means you can be less of a burden for your parents. I get that it's in their name but if you think about it, they paid for your entire life up until college, that's something you're never planning to pay back which is totally reasonable. They got you to the point that you could be independent. Now that you are independent you shouldn't be getting to get your parents to pay for your stuff like when you were a kid.

2. It builds a better relationship with your father. While I dont know the full extent of your relationship, this will be one of the very first real interactions you have adult to adult. You're always go ik ng to be your father's kid, but now you have a chance to be an adult with him. If you cover the loan now, maybe in the future if you have problems, he'll be more happy to help out. You don't want to start your adult life as ""the money grubbing son that came back for more money as soon as he was out of college""

Now if you aren't financially stable, disregard everything over said and have a serious conversation with your dad."

Your father gave you terrible advice on marriage and unloaded on you a load of stuff about your parent's relationship that you didn't need to hear.

He might not like that you guys judged him for how he ate, but your complaint is about a trivial enough topic (plus one he could actually do something about if he cared enough about the discomfort of those around him) that it does not warrant anywhere near this level of vitriol from him.

I wish I had practical advice to give you about how to handle him, all I can do is assure you you did not deserve him speaking to you that way, and please do not take it to heart."
cn6dvd,"NTA

First off, by the sounds of it the ""work"" your girlfriend did was ultimately unsuccessful, which is why you needed your friend to fix it for you.

Secondly, your girlfriend clearly has issues here beyond this one booking; I don't know if you have some deeper past relationship with your friend in Japan that you haven't mentioned, but one way or another your girlfriend is acting incredibly insecure and immature.

*Please* don't ditch the meeting with your friend in Japan, as she has been a good friend to you. What you need to do is figure out whatever is going on with your girlfriend."

I knew several kids growing up in this very position, where the parents strictly limited what they were allowed to experience based on their religion as Jehovah's Witnesses, and it really backfired on the parents when the kids were old enough to experience all of the things they had been denied.

cn812j,"NTA. He's a grown man and business owner who is following and harassing a young woman because he thinks he can intimidate his way out of a debt. 

He's asking for whatever shitty karmic retribution he receives."

cn83bq,YTA- if you just let her bark straight for 2 hours and do nothing about it... now if she out and barks a few minutes here and there- then NTA..: but keep in mind many kids nap times are right between 12-2. So that’s a great way to piss off the neighbors.
cn84za,NTA - Come hang out with us over on r/raisedbynarcissists. This is classic emotional and financial abuse. Snip snip.
cn884t,"NTA. Even though you pay the bills, your father still treats you as his child and makes decisions for you. Stand firm."

What the fuck are you, the doorman? She was 15 feet away, she's just as capable of putting some scoot in her boot if she needs to catch the elevator. It's not like you seen her running for it and let it close.

Besides, calling you an asshole is a total overreaction regardless"
cn8by6,"NTA and you need to ask your friend to move out. She's gotten to the point now where she's taking advantage of you and your suffering financially as a result. If you want to maintain this friendship, you need to ask her to leave or it's going to become toxic. Give her two months, and tell her she has to go."
cn8fvp,"NTA. It sounds like something set her off and when she couldn't come up with an actual explanation for why she was acting the way she did she blamed you and your sister. No mother should respond to their child's ""I still love you"" with ""I don't care""...It definitely sounds like there is something more going on with your mother. Ignore her and spend time with people with positive attitudes (Your sister or friends). Good luck!!!"
cn8go8,"NTA at all.  The delivery and who is present is entirely the choice of She Who Pusheth Out the Baby.  You deserve any doable conditions to give you peace of mind, and under these circumstances in your marriage, I don’t think anyone should fault you.

cn8gt3,"NTA - harsh, perhaps.  Unhelpful, certainly.  But what's your brother's take on all this?"
cn8ir5,"NTA. Your father is totally the asshole in this situation. Your wife had major surgery with serious complications in the healing process. Expecting her to travel whole still healing is unreasonable, especially for something as trivial at gold and outfits. While you probably shouldn't have threatened him with physical violence, at least you proved to him you're willing to stick up for your wife. 

I don't know much about Indian culture, but that should not be an excuse to be an asshole to your wife."

cn8ke9,"I’m not ready to call you an ass but something about the word “grateful” just rubs me the wrong way. I hope your job is worth someone feeling lucky to have it.

Edit: After some replies, I am ready to say YTA. Preferring candidates that are less well off financially because they’ll be “loyal” (ie, less likely to leave if you take advantage of them), is an asshole move. Assuming a candidate is a spoiled brat who will call in sick for a hangover because she came from a more well off background is an asshole move.

Edit: Oh wonderful, Candidate B is Jewish and that’s her “privilege.” Extra heaps of YTA. He will deny his racism but has referred to her as a Jewish American Princess."

cn8n7b,"NTA, why is she buying meat and expecting you to buy a portion of it?  Thats not a gift, that's her trying to spend your money."
cn8nlg,"NTA. Fuck no. 

Let me give you a piece of advice from someone who's been in the nonprofit world on and off for the last 12ish years: if you don't set firm boundaries about your time, you *will* be taken advantage of and you *will* burn out. 

I promise you that I understand the guilt involved in being like ""No, I don't think I'll help [hurricane victims/struggling poor people/whoever] this weekend--I think I'm gonna take a nap in my comfy apartment and think about all the food I have to eat instead!"" Really, I do. But you gotta try to look at this with an eye toward the long term. Do you want to be able to keep doing this meaningful work for a long time? If you do, then you just literally cannot spend all of your time off doing deployments to disaster zones, or whatever it is they're trying to pressure you to do. You will burn out and grow to resent the work and go get a meaningless job that doesn't use your good heart to manipulate you out of the money you've earned, and your cause will be short one cool person with valuable skills.

They intentionally downplayed the circumstances of this ask in order to hook you, and they refused your *incredibly* generous offer to work for free? Fuck that and fuck them. Honestly, I'd start looking around for other work if I were you. 

Out of curiosity, what's the turnover like for people at your level at your job? Is it....high?"
cn8nqr,"NTA , but I think it'd be more productive to tell your friends how their actions upset you rather than lie to them out of anger."

What does your son enjoy? He and his mom enjoy these so-called girly activities too, so don't shit on them.

Also, cars are not just for boys... 

I'd report this as an awfulbrag except I know fathers who are really like this."
cn8pf2,"NTA. Actually ywbta if you tell your dad and your mom gets kicked out. 

You can move out, but keep a bed and some belongings in the house in case he ever visits. 

If he hasn’t lived in the house for 25 years, you and your mom could contact a lawyer to see about getting the deed transferred to you, and see if there is any other recourse."
cn8r4h,"NTA. He doesn't even offer gas money? Yeah, it's your car, your time, your life. Just tell him no."
cn8w3p,"NTA, but like maybe Google the brand of Mat and buy a new one for her. Say you lost the old one."
cn8wh8,"NAH...An xbox uses less electricity than a 100w lightbulb. You're narrowing his job search field significantly by not allowing him to get his license.

I'm not saying YTA, because he's clearly gotta get motivated.. but you're shooting yourself in the foot and wondering why it hurts to walk here."
cn8wl5,NTA - that's not her business to share. Also just because she's your parent doesn't give her the right to discuss the business of an adult child.
cn8yfw,"YTA and that’s literally illegal.

If your dad had such documents he likely had the right to it. That sucks he left your mom but this is a shitty way to get revenge.

Good luck when he realizes these documents were stolen

Edit: not to mention you are punishing his family for something that wasn’t their fault. If your father wasn’t giving a fair amount the your mom should have taken him to court about child support and all that long ago"
cn8z2i,"No, you have the right to tell her your feelings and ask. She has the right to say no. Ultimately it’s her choice, but if you want no part in parenthood make that clear to her now. Make sure she knows if she has this kid you’re dipping out."
cn91ve,"YTA. He commented that you lost weight, not that you gained it. Geesh. Sure it was bad timing but he apologized. It should all end there. 

Half of your post is complaining about your life. You just took all of these frustrations that have nothing to do with him out on him in this moment.

You need to gain some self awareness and apologize to him for your misdirected anger."
cn92xi,NTA - anyone who outs anyone else is automatically an asshole
cn94ig,"NTA. Although probably could have titled this ""ignoring the awkward/creepy guy"" as his sexual orientation has little to do with this. Sucks for your friend to have experienced that in the back of the car though."
cn95mz,NTA. Sounds like the mother needs to be reported. Even us non doctors know not to eff about with antibiotics!!
cn964r,"NAH. If this man died despite medical attention and an ambulance, there's probably not much you could've done to save his life if you had stopped. In fact you didn't get cell service so if you had stopped to help him, you would've been unable to call for an ambulance. Sure maybe you could've loaded him in the car, driven him to the hospital, but who knows what difference it could've made? His death is not on your hands. I can only imagine the guilt you're experiencing right now."
cn98go,NTA - she is an adult and it's ridiculous your parents put you in charge of taking care of her in the first place.
cn9ci3,"YTA.  You're trying to cheat your employer, and you're pissed at him for not wanting to help you do that.  YTA that everyone at the office hates because you do as little as possible and everyone else ends up needing to bear more than their fair share of the work.  Grow up and do your job."
cn9cw0,YTA. Obviously. You just implied divorce in a standard argument.
cn9foo,"OP, you're looking for relationship advice. Go to a different sub."
cn9k3e,"NTA
Not only do you have a right to privacy, it sounds like your dad has some insane paranoia. 
While I understand the need for caution, he should know that his children aren’t dangerous criminals, and don’t need checking up on 24/7. Using his security system as a tool for espionage is not cool, and it is an invasion of your privacy."
cn9nea,NTA. They should flat out replace it. That's bullshit.
cn9noh,"NTA

You're absolutely right, that kinda shit will emotionally scar the poor kid, especially if (as it likely will) happen again. I don't know what your husband is thinking but he's got issues, he doesn't care about the kid!"
cn9pvo,"NTA

But know this will blow shit up and cause drama. Not saying you shouldn't do it since I wouldn't want that energy at my wedding. Just be aware this will be the beginning of a lot of drama, and your dad may not end up being at your wedding either depending how things pan out."
cn9r50,YTA. You sound like a kid who does everything half assed and is then disappointed that mom isn't showering him with praise.
cn9r5g,NTA.  Baby not asshole either.  your foster son was the one that made those choices.  He's an adult and has to live with the choices he makes.  You shouldn't have to burden yourself financially after all that you've done for him.  He decided to drop out and move in with his girlfriend.  He decided to have a child.  He needs to live with the decisions he makes.  I feel bad for the child.

Former restaurant manager here.  The service dog is there to treat a person as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.

Last time I checked ""dog allergy"" is not a disability.

From a customer side, they handled it wrong.  I was out with my wife and kids this weekend doing back to school shopping.  We went to a restaurant for lunch and were seated next to a large party with a screaming baby.

It was unbearable.  But instead of causing an issue, I quietly went to the server station and asked to be moved across the venue to an empty table (there were plenty, it was 2:30 on a Sunday).  They were totally cool with it because we didn't make a huge deal out of it.

My point is, screw the jerks with the allergies.  Literally your entire adult life is nothing but doing things you'd rather not, so suck it up."
cna4pr,"YTA. They explicitly said they don't want things they want money. Your wood thing is a thing. This isn't about you, it's about them. Give them what they're asking for, not what you want to."
cna5rz,I’m abstaining from making any statement about assholeness. This is not an easy situation and you should seek out a therapist. You’re dealing with things that are typically dealt with at a way older age. I have no doubt that you are one hell of a tough individual but please have someone help you. I wish you all the best.

cnai8c,"ESH. He sucks because he shouldn't be projecting his pain past trauma onto you. 

You suck because instead of helping him with therapy or helping him get professional help, you just tell him to suck it up. While your advice isn't wrong, it still comes off as AHoleish. 

I recommend you help him get into therapy so he can have professional help to deal with these issues. I don't think telling him to get over it will do much for him.

EDIT: After seeing he was told to get therapy multiple times by OP and refusing it, I am changing it to NTA. I cant blame OP if he is refusing to get help."

Your dad isn't doing anything ***to you,*** he's doing something ***for himself*** and you're taking it personally. 

Listen, I don't necessarily think that a 55yo man and a 24yo woman could possibly have enough in common to forge a meaningful and lasting relationship and I think he's probably primarily indulging his physical desires through this relationship. 

It's shitty that you lost your mom and I'm really sorry for that. But he also lost his wife of who knows how many years. He's human and I'm certain he's lonely, probably horny, and doesn't want to be alone. He's found a companion, and you need to support him until the relationship is detrimental ***to him.***

You're being really selfish about this and he needs you. He's already lost his wife; don't take away his daughter too."
cnaove,"NTA. 

Do not include her - she is toxic and horrible, and dumping her mental illness all over you. 

Invite her to the wedding when your husband will be there to have your back, but don't include her in dress shopping and whatnot - she will ruin it, and then you will resent her when you think back. Go with your mum, or if your mum is going to be a pain, go with a good girlfriend."
cnaq8f,"NTA, you are trying to protect your friend from being hurt."
cnaqd8,"Nta. She has a child now, time to grow up. She doesnt get to hang out and get high anymore. She needs a job and she chose a momentary high over providing for her child without leaning on her parents. As a mother of 4 who got pregnant at 17 I don't care if it's a ""one time mistake"". If she is living in your house and your paying for her and her child, she needs to shape up."
cnaqjk,"This doesn't belong here, imo, but on an advice sub or lgbt issues sub. Coming out can't be an asshole move. But in case you don't post elsewhere I'll give you fair warning that if they react badly the person who'll be hurt the most is you."

In my school if something like this happens we usually joke about it and sometimes even call another teacher to help us out. If you are worried about it maybe just go talk to her and apologize if necessary. Just let her know you didn’t mean to offend her in anyway."

cnbvxh,"YTA.

Am I correctly understanding that you're boasting because you managed to do for three days a thing that she's been doing for four years straight? 

If you went to the park and the grocery store, did a bunch of projects, taught your kids new things, cooked fabulous dinners, and cleaned the house in this brief time, it seems basically impossible to me that you actually worked all of the hours between nine and five for your day job. By ""doing my 9 - 5 job"", do you mean ""I checked in on Slack from time to time?"" How much longer than three days do you think you'd have been able to get away with that?

Have you actually asked your wife about how she felt when you said all this? You don't mention her actual reaction in the story at all. If I were in her shoes, you wouldn't have made me feel like a bad mom, you'd have just made me feel like my husband was kind of a moron for deciding he's god's gift to parenting after three days of success. 

This whole post feels like a really tone deaf humblebrag. I'm having a hard time believing you decided to brag on yourself because you genuinely thought she'd feel worried and guilty that you had to do dad things for three whole days in a row."

cnc9s7,"Idk what judgement to put on this. Talking shit about a parent being annoying is a typical teenage thing. I can understand that your mother is stressed out etc. but she has to be stupid if she thinks calling her own child ""a fat pig"" is gonna make you do what she wants you to. That is also far from acceptable behaviour from an adult, and even worse for a parent.

Raising kids is her job, not yours. It reminds me a bit of a radio programme I heard a good few years ago. The family therapist they interviewed said something along the lines of ""Parents don't have any rights (towards their children), they only have responsibilities"". 

That being said, I do think that if you're old enough to move out, you're also old enough to at least attempt to have a real conversation with her about your expectations of eachother. Not one where you're yelling at eachother about who's turn it is to take the dishes, but one where you sit down and calmly talk about your problems. It's very easy to assume the worst when you're only screaming all the time (for both of you). Give her a second chance (or last, if you will).

People in relationship with someone who has untreated mental illness end up like someone in relationship with a person who has  untreated alcoholism.

I've had it, and it really isn't pleasant and there is a lot you have to do afterwards to maintain it and keep healthy. It does help, but it is not like she got to take a pill and magically get skinnier. I don't like to talk about it much, but I don't sit on my high horse and pretend I became a gym junkie and lost weight that way. You are fair when saying it is wrong to do that to people who genuinely did bust their ass in a gym to do it. 

She is the asshole for acting like she did it through exercise when she didn't, but it is not completely ""the easy way out"" either."
cndbs4,"So, I firmly think you're NTA, but I also wanted to say that I think a lot of people in the thread are giving the guy too much benefit of the doubt.

A lot of men can't stand women crying. It makes them uncomfortable and they have an impulse to ""fix"" it. Going up to a random person you don't know and telling them there's no reason to cry is pretty arrogant. It'd be one thing if he asked you what was wrong then offered his condolences. But going up to a crying woman and telling her there's no reason to cry, and to calm down, is him walking up to her and invalidating her feelings off the bat. Especially since he has zero idea of what's actually wrong. 

The dude wasn't just a misunderstood samaritan trying to cheer you up. He was an asshole. Maybe he didn't mean to be one, but he was one nevertheless. That's why this isn't a ""no assholes here"" situation. Because there was an asshole here, and it isn't OP."

cndhul,"NTA, what were you supposed to do?"
cndirz,NTA. You don’t owe solicitors your time.
cndmby,"NTA. I guess I'm in the minority here but I think that sometimes punching someone is appropriate. I'm not a serial fighter or anything, haven't thrown a punch since I was 10 (I'm 37 now) and this kid was picking on me. And if I'm to take you at your word here and accept your story as truth...someone intentionally lying with the specific intent of damaging your relationship is punch worthy. Frankly, I'm proud of you."
cndmzv,"NTA, however I also don’t think someone is an asshole for refusing you. It’s one of those either happens or it doesn’t, neither one is an asshole for simply refusing, unless done in an asshole way"
cndnsm,"NTA. I would think if your son would be behaving in activities that could harm him, it would be okay for the “community worker” to bring it up. However, she’s upset that your son isn’t in the partying phase. Peer pressure from teens is enough, let alone dealing with “adults”. Your son will adventure into those things when it’s time for him too, no need to speed it up by a so called “adult”."
cndoxv,"NTA - that sounds fishy as fuck. He's a veteran (#1), he was driving his car , when his wife had a seizure (#2) and crashed (#3), she's in the hospital now (#4) and the car has been towed (#5), he needs money for a room at a motel (#6)and he knows exactly how much this would be (#7). Even if everything he said it was true, he could probably have slept in a waiting room of the hospital. but yeah no, NTA, you just avoided to be scammed"
cnds3i,NTA. You’re his mommy. GET RID OF THE LEECH !!!!
cndsha,YTA Babies don’t come on a timer. Do you want to miss your child’s birth?
cndu6y,"NTA (the damage was specifically one person's, after all), but I'd make peace with knowing that you probably won't see the money."
cnduxz,YTA! You aren't just fucking with your boss but you're fucking with the sellers' businesses! They might lose sales or have items go for way less than they otherwise would have because you scared off potential buyers!
cndxkh,"NTA.

Yeah UM WTF. It's their mom. Hell no it isn't your and your wife's responsibility. I think your wife should tell her mom and aunt to stop being a shitty person or figure out an alternative solution."
cndxz0,"NTA it's actually pretty normal for kids to do that. Don't know why, but it IS really annoying. My little sister would scream at the top of her lungs for no reason too. But it's not YOUR kid, so you shouldn't have to watch her. You go there to hang out with your gf, not watch someone else's kids. Don't get me wrong, it would be nice practice if you ever decide you want kids or whatever, but I don't think you're the asshole for not wanting to watch your gf's siblings."
cne2ac,"ESH  You both have trouble managing your time and planning ahead.  You were late already and she waited until the last minute to ask you to take out the trash (which was both of yours, since you live together).  You should split the fine."
cne3w3,"NTA: You are right and they are wrong. Driving drunk is an antisocial act and endangers other people's lives. Since he cannot understand that, he doesn't deserve to be here on visa."
cne43x,"You tried to burn your mothers hand because she annoyed you? Is that really how you solve your problems?

Yeah, YTA."
cne44q,NTA seems like you should cut them both out of your life. He probably only wanted to go so he could talk shit about it and would probably be talking or playing on his phone during it anyway.
cne4sf,"> ""And perhaps I should have taken care of your grandpa, so that nuissance could've died sooner, and hadn't outlived his usefulness"" 

WTF that is way worse than what he said. Not because it is a human vs. a dog, but because you are being so insulting about his grandpa. What a nasty thing to say.

ESH but you are like 10x worse."
cne6sp,"Yta. Not because of what you chose, you're TA because of *why* you made your choice."

cnec5t,NTA: Your Mom sounds like she is a little psychologically impaired. Showering with an 8 year old to save water and wearing ferret scent?
cneden,"NTA for tipping based on the service, but adding the note that says ""tip at door.  If you make me come to the lot your tip will be to deliver to the apartment next time"" is pretty aggressive and rude.  Don't be That Guy.  Just let them know you'll be tipping in cash."
cnel9g,"YTA. And you haven't even tried to get pregnant before. I have no clue why someone told you at 10 that you may be infertile, which isn't even necessarily true. You are being a huge asshole about this."
cnelox,"NTA, that's your house, you control your environment and what your kids have to be exposed to"
cnelt2,I'm gonna go with NTA. She made a choice to put everything in her room. Sure she needs to chill out every now and then but everything is in that room. All the food. All the dishes. All the clothes. If she's mad and locks her door then y'all are fucked basically. Sure she needs her space but she needs to find it somewhere else. She could go for a walk or drive or the bathroom or closet.
cnen3p,"YTA. That’s super petty. You guys are brother and sister. The fact you don’t wanna pick him up is because you didn’t birth him? Bullshit. You get off of work 2 hours earlier than your mom, you can do her a favor and pick your brother up."
cnen7b,[deleted]
cnenzb,"YTA 

Your intentions were good but your execution was terrible...

Yes it would have been good to sit down and try there food and leave it there. But saying I’m getting mac Donald’s makes the parents feel like shit. I understand that you meant no harm but saying you would rather eat fast food over an excellent dish is degrading."
cneo5r,"NTA. People move out. You're not abandoning them. How could you possibly be an asshole for trying to start your own life? Even if they were perfect parents you would not be the asshole for moving out at this age it's basically expected.

Edit: As for how to go about moving out, since you asked, a) find a job or start applying to schools and financial aid and then b) tell them you're moving out."
cneocq,"ESH - those parents do indeed suck, and you should be going slow enough where this isn't a problem.  Someone needs to stick you on the LA freeway at rush hour and suddenly you'll feel like 10 miles an hour is plenty fast (and it is for a residential neighborhood).

I agree with your mom, a 17 year old telling a bunch of suburbanites how to parent won't go down well.  If it's really a huge issue, tip off the police that there are kids running into the roadway with no supervision.  Small chance that will backfire if the police are good old boys, but in reality that is part of their job to look into."
cnerzt,[deleted]
cnew0a,"NTA

A few things:

You don't have to do what you're told by your brother (depending on ages I guess). 

I agree with your mum that the best option was to work together to either both go to the door (especially if you felt scared) or for both of you to ignore it. 

However, his violence and belief he has the right to control you is concerning perhaps talk to your parents about it separately and explain how it makes you feel."
cnezfv,NTA that poor doggo :(
cnezs1,"NAH. It’s not your decision. They have as much of a right to take in your sister as you do to not want to take her in. I can see why you’re upset, but unfortunately, I  don’t think there’s anything you can do about it."
cnf1hy,This is a shit post isnt it
cnf1ik,"YTA It's a blood test, not a blood donation. The impact on your boyfriend's alcohol tolerance is negligible.

cnf28p,"Sorry, but YWBTA

Reasons for them to sleep in your bed include: 1) they're doing you a favor, 2) the sheets are getting cleaned, 3) they're older and have said the couch is uncomfortable 4) you don't have an alternative guest room, 5) your wife is just fine with it. 

Reasons for them to sleep on the couch include: 1) you don't like it.

Enough said I think."
cnf471,"NTA: But take some Hershey's syrup and smear it all over the dildo. Also, make sure it's big and anatomically correct with veins and balls. Here are some other ideas.

Take a giant shit in the toilet, and not flush.

Take some sugar and chop up some lines on the coffee table.

Leave some raunchy porn playing on repeat on a laptop with the sound maxed out.

Get some jack off magazines at the adult bookstore, drizzle Ivory liquid soap over them and leave them out.

Draw a chalk outline of a body on the living room floor.

Yeah I just watch my karma drop in real time."
cnf4bw,"NTA

>We have had numerous challenges with this employee which fall into the category of the employee not performing up to the standard expected and being unreceptive to feedback to improve performance

That's grounds to fire someone. I feel bad this is gonna impact them so much, and it sounds like you do too, but nobody did this to them but themselves.  Just because they need the job more doesn't mean they don't have to do the job to keep it."
cnfb76,"ESH - stepmom should not have offered, GF should not have egged you on, you should not have done it, Dad should not have threatened violence.

cnfckk,NTA and considering all that you were actually nice
cnfd1i,"NTA 

You didn’t ruin Dave’s life, Dave ruined Dave’s life."
cnfdk1,"NTA - You did the right thing. Who the hell parks their car on a sidewalk? If it was an emergency (like their battery died or something) I could see it as being reasonable, but they clearly weren't considering they drove off after you talked to them."
cnffuw,"NTA. She is 11. The other mom dropping them off at an amusement park seems fun to her (even with being miserable by the end) because she is 11. The other mom dropping them off WITHOUT TELLING HER PARENTS is completely inappropriate and something they need to know. Anything could have happened, especially since the parents had no idea where their daughter was, and their daughter would not have wanted to tell them or contact them if something had happened because she knew they would be unhappy. You are NTA, your niece is NTA, but that other mom is definitely YTA if she knew your niece's parents had no idea."
cnfgde,NTA if his audition will condenser or hamper the trip.
cnfgg8,"NTA - More importantly, why does he want an erect dick tattooed on him?"
cnfhcg,"NAH because you haven't done anything harmful to your dad.

You don't help an alcoholic by letting them drink and not saying anything about it. That's enabling them. Having people around your dad who won't pretend his drinking isn't a problem and won't look the other way is good for him. You are being a good kid."
cnfixf,"She's also an asshole for choosing to bring a child into the world in such a shitty situation. 

That's another human life. Sure it grows in her body but that is a separate human being. That baby will grow up knowing his daddy didn't want him or love him. His mom didn't have the decency to be ready for him. She doesn't even have the maturity to care for him/her yet. 

So many people never meet their full potential because they're raised by irresponsible idiots. When you're dealing with a human life it's not the time to wing it and hope it turns out well. She should abort or adopt out."
cnfljy,NTA. This guy abused you for the better part of your childhood. He has cancer and that sucks but he shouldn’t be relying on someone who he fucking whipped and hit to pay his bills for him. You owe him absolutely nothing.
cnfobe,"NTA. 

Your sister, as you say, was spreading a skewed version of the truth in which she painted herself as the victim. That's not right on any level. You were justified in calling her out. 

That being said, you probably needed to have a better method of confrontation. Virtual confidence is a real thing and people can and most of the time will have more severe reactions via text than in real life.  Also, you seem like the asshole to her friends because she said her story first. That's what they know now, the skewed story and not the truth. If you want to convince them, youre going to need more."
cnfpyd,"NTA 
 Kids take after parents these people are used to getting their way and when the don’t they throw fits scream and like Logan react physically"
cnfs47,"YTA if you talk about his past

He used you as a reference though, so just tell them you haven't talked to him since eighth grade and based on what he was like then, you wouldn't recommend him.

edit: I missed the sensitive information part.  maybe be little more forceful in your non-recommendation. So not ""I wouldn't recommend him"" more like ""I would recommend against it."""
cnftn5,"NTA - first of all, why does this kid need a bath every night? And why lotion? Not your kid, you're not being paid, i'd have a convo with your mom."
cnfvh3,"NTA - humans are garbage, animals are not."
cnfxzb,NTA. People deserve to go get a meal without their dignity being insulted. You did the right thing. That one mom and her daughter being kicked out likely won’t mean fewer people get served.... it means more people will be served in a kind manner.
cnfzfh,"dude. OP clearly said that if it wasn't too bad, they might've gone. all it took was them telling OP costs, but their friends didn't bother. and it's a mutual friend, not someone OP doesn't like. jesus christ..."
cng17j,"NTA. I love cats but I agree with you that it's gross to let them walk on food prep surfaces. 

Try using double sided tape or a Ssscat motion detector to keep kitty off the countertops."
cng1di,"ESH. She acts like a jerk, but calling her a not-lady is petty and accomplishes nothing. Also you squeezing past her as she's trying to cross is a bit rude on its own."
cng3cl,"NTA - You asked kindly for her to stop and she didn't respect that.

Also, if she complains about doing laundry I don't understand why she's so mad about you doing your own all of the sudden. It seems like she wants to complain and hold this over you and say ""well I do this and this for you"" so she can use that against you in future. 

If she wants to wash your clothes, she needs to do it properly. If she can't respect that she needs to let you do it."
cng730,"NTA

r/JUSTNOMIL level shit here"
cng8ft,"You were driving in stop and go traffic, and looked away from the road, to verify your purse was still in the car? Weird.  


YTA - Only because you could have been more clear with the officer investigating the scene of the accident. The people in the car could have been in shock, which is why they didn't seem to understand when you clearly stated that you hit them.  


>a long long time ago

You should really just let it go at this point. :)"
cng8ra,"ESH. Her behavior was atrocious. You’re not the asshole for embarrassing her, but you certainly are for assaulting her."
cnga7i,"Definitely NTA dude.

I legitimately can’t count how many girls I know who have *at least* one horror story about an extremely creepy Uber driver. I’d assume it’s just about every girl I know who has the app.

I’ve had drivers try to “bro out” with me in the past, and there’s a difference between that and the guy you described. You probably saved a ton of girls from having, *at best*, a highly uncomfortable ride.

Good on ya, OP."
cngbjy,NTA. And those iPad square payments suck for pressuring people
cngexe,"Overall, NTA. BUT I think there is a better way to deal with this, other than kicking the two girls out.

This is straight up bullying right here. These girls have pre-meditated plans to bully younger members out of the troop, which seems counter-intuitive to girl scouts morals (though idk anything about girl scouts). I think Sasha definitely sounds like the ring-leader here and booting her out would be justified, the other two however may have also been bullied into participating. The main issue, I think, is to show the two girls the seriousness of their actions, the impacts they have, and why it is 100% not okay. I would try to arrange a meeting btw the parents (Megan's and the two girls'), maybe a second meeting including the girls. This way, you can maybe see if these girls parent's will agree to discipline them on this subject and garner a sincere apology; *have the parents back you up*. Perhaps discuss a probationary period. If the parents are in hardcore denial, then I'm not sure these girls will understand what they did was bullying. In this case, I don't have a lot of confidence these girls won't continue bullying.

As for this Sasha girl, idk. She sounds like a goner, and will probably get what's coming to her in high school. ***/s***

Edit: sarcasm warning for literalists"
cngfla,"YTA but only because it's not your kid.  I agree with your reasoning, but you're not in charge here.  Your dad's right.  Mind your own business.  Imagine if your neice or nephew tried to undermine your parenting."
cngg8h,"YTA, admittedly an understandable one. It'd be one thing if you just wanted the day to be one where everyone is focused on you and not your sister - that's basic bride territory. It sounds like this is less that and more taking advantage of the social leverage provided by your wedding to make her look bad, which is an asshole move.

And honestly, I don't think it's going to help that much. It's cheaper than therapy, but a lot more hit-or-miss. She ends up looking good in an intentionally unflattering dress, how's that going to make you feel on your wedding day?"
cngj94,"NAH

This is a tough situation. 

From what you're describing, it sounds like the hoarding and cleanliness issues were your SOs father's. That degree of deterioration actually seems like it could be tied to a mental health problems. Considering they were close, it's probably a topic he preferred to avoid with him, especially as he got older.

I'm not saying you shouldn't discuss it, but I'd maybe put away the alarmist conclusions when you approach it. I think it's important to make sure you have similar expectations when it comes to cleanliness and division of labor.

Good luck!"
cngkfe,"I mean, you're breaking the law so there's that."
cngrvd,"ESH. 

He shouldn't have announced your issues, and you shouldn't have announced his. Couldn't he have taken in info from the conversation without making it known that he has ED? It's completely valid that you want him to have help, but it's also completely valid that he was embarrassed and didn't want people to know."
cngu98,"NTA. Lots of friends grow apart after high school. It sucks, but that’s the reality of life."
cngui6,Def. Nta. You did your daughter a solid. It's surprising that she would react that way when receiving money. She comes of as being entitled the way you described it. I think you did an awesome thing.
cngujx,"NAH, he just seems like a worried parent. He just comes off the wrong way. Instead of talking to him less maybe you should tell him what makes you happy and how it's your life.  He needs to understand you're an adult. If that doesn't work then tell him how you really feel about the way he talks to you."
cngzt4,NTA!!! But literally every other party in this story is
cnh4fs,**NTA** r/entitledparents
cnh4vs,"NTA.  I highly encourage you to leave your MIL out of the loop.  Disinvite all of the MIL friends.  Those are her friends, not yours.  They don't care about your wedding like your families +1 would and have no relation to you.  

I think you guys need to put hard boundaries now or it's just going to be worse after you get married.  

Tell her she is being extremely nasty.  This is your guys wedding and your parents are being generous to pay for it.  Either the MIL needs to be happy with YOUR guest list or she doesn't come at all.  Be STERN with her and DONT BUDGE.  I also suggest getting a bouncer to kick out any unexpected guests your MIL tries to bring.  I think you should allow your family to do a +1 and tell your MIL friends to get lost because they don't know you and aren't going to be there to support you."
cnh5us,"NAH. There are certainly some workplace issues that can and should be worked out directly with that person, but body odor isn’t one of them. Let HR do their thing."
cnh6b5,"Yta for not using punctuation. This is barely legible, and you're supposed to be in college."
cnh869,"NTA- sorry, but it doesn’t sound like he’s that into you. Either that or he has some serious anxiety issues and just doesn’t want to see you in person. It’s time to try dating a guy who wants to be available for you. You’re too young to settle for this"
cnhdu5,"NTA on so many levels.

1, even if she WAS your sister (which she is not, she is your step sister) you have NO obligation to let her live with you. It's her PARENTS job to look after her, not yours.

2, your parents are MAJOR assholes for telling her she could live with you without consulting you, especially as it's for the selfish reason that they cant deal with her behaviour.... which they allowed to develop.

3, I know I wouldnt want some irresponsible stupid drug user moving into my house... regardless of their relationship to me."
cnhiva,"ESH for putting the dog in danger in the first place. 

You shouldn't have let the dog get the pill, she shouldn't have let her dog around pills. You both suck so you can both pay the bill -- split it."
cnhpdz,"NTA.

Funerals are for the living not the dead and if it wouldn't have helped you in any way, then there's no point in going.

Well done for supporting yourself for so many years. It must have been tough at 16."
cnhrgj,"Edit: NTA You’ve been there for a year, the supervisor should support you finding a new work environment or help you on your process as an undergrad. Inappropriate, the supervisor asking you what was wrong with them in person. 

Previous: 
No a holes present, but I certainly wouldn’t have thought that a supervisor at a part time internship that you had been at for two weeks would be an appropriate person for a reference at a new institution doing almost exactly the same thing. You should also give it more of a try, an undergraduate intern isn’t going to learn much part time over two weeks probably."
cnht3m,"YTA

He gave you a car. If he wanted you to have 6 grand and not a car, he'd have given you 6 grand.

However theres nothing wrong with asking him about this. Just if you sold without asking."
cnhybr,NTA you're giving him alternatives and he's refusing cuz he thinks his texts are more important than your job. It's rude and you're totally justified in setting that boundary
cni99n,"NTA, IMO this is everything to do with your family wanting to control over you and nothing at all to do with them thinking your gf should spend more time with her family."
cnidv3,"NTA

The go with the flow shit only works for young single people with no kids or responsibilities."
cnihaq,YTA - you are not entitled to use someone else’s property for any reason.   They’ve asked you not to and you’ve ignored this.  The “increased risk” is entirely on you.
cnikjq,"NTA - sounds like he's trying to scam people out of money since it's a few years old and waits for you to read it before asking for money.

I've had some random guy guy on the street pull the same thing with a book he wrote and he tried so hard to guilt me into paying for it,  I just handed it back and walked on.

You're under no obligation to be pressured into paying for something you didn't ask for."
cninuu,"ESH. The mother in law clearly sucks and your friend (the bride) sucks because she isn’t being straightforward with the MIL. Also the bride should be able to talk with her future husband about the mother.

Don’t join in on the hate. It’s just going to get messier."
cnirhg,"of course YTA: firstly it's not anxiety its **JEALOUSY** you are being so controlling, you have no right to know who she is talking to and when, she is allowed private conversations. This is normally the first stage of an abusive and toxic relationship. 

That's not a simple request that is an invasion of her privacy, next you will want to dictate who she speaks to."
cniwta,"NTA, it doesnt seem too fair, the way you've explained it, and if hes already forming opinions without even trying it, you might want to talk about that specifically. In any case, perhaps not watch football with him and tell him your feelings about that,,,"
cnix9w,"NTA. I would not be calling that person a friend.

Don't be a doormat state the issues don't hint"
cnizn5,"NTA. 

If it was just a vacation, I'd say cancel her ticket since you paid for most of it. But since it's to go to her sister's wedding, I say take her to small claims court for the amount you paid."
cnj43h,NTA at all. That's disgusting. Sure he came from his smoking break and not the toilet and didn't wash his hands before sticking his fingers into your food?
cnj69w,"ESH if he's your tech it's your job to train him on getting it the way you want it and that might mean he messes up some while he's learning how.

Welcome to the management of others"
cnj76v,"NAH, I think you two really need to discuss what you want from the living arrangement, but you're not an asshole for wanting to live with your other friends too."
cnjdrm,"NAH yeah, you shouldn't have snapped at him, but he also needs to understand boundaries. It doesn't seem like you're using him, it seems like he's making it impossible  for you to turn down what he's offering, which naturally  makes you feel indebted. You need to have a real discussion with him do set the boundaries, as well as apologize  for snapping"
cnjofq,NTA. Your mom sounds like a nightmare. Classic narcissist - nothing you do will ever be good enough.
cnjqtt,"NAH 

You have to understand that this is her process and is probably for the best that she does take a break...some people just ""can't "" sometimes.

But you are just as entitled to your feelings and mental state, if you dont feel like you can go on with this dynamic then that is also fair from your side. I would message her an Express your feelings, and at the very least compromise on a deal where she atleast tells you shes okay and just need the time.

And sadly, you cant really on a mentally unstable person for emotional support...as much as they might want to be there for you they cant mentally give you 100%."
cnjrja,"NTA That’s cheating and if she ever tells anyone (which she probably will at some point) you are in deep trouble. This could put your job at risk. 
If she is qualified she will get the job fairly."
cnjtqf,"“He doesn’t have anyone else!” Says his sister.

“But I live too far away to help!” She says to the the estranged son that lives a few states away.

Amazing that he comes back into your life when he needs comfort and care late in life after abusing his body into falling apart. NTA, and don’t be guilted into getting used by someone who has never been there for you."
cnkcoc,NTA and your friend is the reason people who teach English get called dancing monkeys on other subs. He was wrong and misleading
cnkhu1,"YTA - why not just say: Hey, I noticed you have a spot behind your ear that you might want to get checked? 

Not even doctors diagnose someone with *cancer* just by looking at moles. That was really inappropriate."
cnkjyk,[deleted]
cnkkbj,NTA. They need to treat you like a person.
cnkn79,NAH That is a lot of support payments but I understand her not wanting to uproot the children. Separations are tough on everyone. Good luck and try to be as amicable as possible.
cnkoi8,"YTA

> Once it came to my attention, I shut him down completely. I felt angry and betrayed. He never made any advances to her, at least that I know of, 

Betrayed because he developed feelings? Not for acting on those feelings, but for *developing* them? You do realize that he's a human being and most times we can't control what we feel right? If he went after your girl then he would be TA, but as far as we can see he didn't and you overreacted. So YTA."
cnks36,"NTA. 

Your fiance doesn't get to make big unilateral decisions like this. You and the kids need to be his first priority. Not his mother.

MIL is out of line to suggest her son buy a house with her instead of you."
cnkyj2,"NTA - you’re totally right that you taking time off other commitments warrants payment. 

All you did was phrase it badly. When you told her you used Als photos as promotional material but couldn’t use hers, you sent an unintended message that she was too fat/ugly to be promotional material. 

You should’ve said that you only did it for free as it was your first time getting into boudoir photography and didn’t want to charge for something you might not be good at. Now you’re booked up with them, you know you’re good at it and you know that you can charge people a fair amount.

You’re not an asshole here, Karen is for her reaction originally and for literally trying to destroy your business. 

Don’t get disheartened though, if you keep doing things well, business will pick back up! Just make sure to get happy customers to leave positive reviews, maybe offer a discount to anyone who does. 

That way, before long you’ll have way more positive than the negative Karen leaves and people will eventually start to ignore her as a result."
cnkysi,"NTA - lots of people have this stupid sense of loyalty to their employer but look at this way:

You give them your time and they give you money. That’s literally it, they purchase that time from you and beyond that, you don’t owe them a damn thing. 

If someone else is willing to pay more for your time, you’d be a fool not to take it."
cnl5u0,NTA. And a $500 christening gift is crazy as hell.
cnlgwv,"YTA, sounds like she wants people round less. She doesn't even have her own room. Why not make it only once a week."

There is nothing wrong with being a feminist, though what that has to do with this situation, I have no idea.

For your own wellbeing, you need to learn how to deal with these situations. I would recommend a women's selfdefense class ASAP. The likelihood anything bad would have happened in that situation was pretty low, but knowing how to defend yourself makes a huge difference.

Many smart phones also have a method for calling 911 without having to follow the normal process. ([e.g.](https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/productivity-tips/how-to-use-emergency-sos-on-your-iphone-to-quickly-call-911)) You can do this with your hand in your pocket.

The most important thing is to learn to have a cool head and not panic."

It sounds like the company is trying to review its processes and improve upon them, thus asking about work done in the past and implementing the new training you’re receiving. 

You sound extremely resistant to change. It sounds like you think that because you’ve been there so long, that your way of doing things must be the best way. This is rarely true in most industries, most business processes can be improved upon as technology & society advances. 

Your comment about your coworkers being young is concerning. What does their age have to do with anything?  They may be questioning the way you work because more efficient ways to do things have been implemented and they’re trying to help you, or maybe they’ve been told to “watch over” you by your superiors, to make sure you’re following process because they sense you’re adverse to change. 

Your trainer being annoying is not a reason to quit. Most people have to deal and work with people they do not like or get along with, after 12 years you should know this. This reasoning is immature and only shows that you’re incapable of managing relationships in the workplace. If they truly talk too much about non work related things, it’s your responsibility to complain to your current boss about it, not just whine about it. If you have done this, it wasn’t in your post. 

I think you need to embrace the change and try your best to assimilate. If the new environment really isn’t  for you, it would be disrespectful to quit without notice. You’ve been there over a decade and it sounds like they are trying to invest in you with training, etc. Quitting without notice would just be a slap in the face and would definitely make you the asshole."

Your roommate seems like she wants to feel superior to you and is willing to justify her logic in any way she can. The next time she tries to talk about it, I’d say something along the lines of “I don’t care about this and don’t want to talk about it anymore” or even “Are you trying to pick a fight?” because that’d put her in the same awkward corner she’s trying to force you into without being a dick about it."

Probably out of love but still..."" why don't you wear a dress, don't you want to do something nice with your hair? Maybe you should put on some make-up... I'm sure your sister would be happy to show you how"".  It's a pretty common mindset although I admit I'm reading some into this here.  The part you were you say that her sister was ""ecstatic"" to see her in a sundress is a huge screaming red flag.

So she wore something pretty and feminine for you and the first thing you did was go and show it to her *family?* like  "" oh my god, look how good and *different* she looks"".

A five year old is not fluent in anything. If you break the pattern of one of you speaking x and the other y, she will only learn how to prioritize the most commonly spoken language. 

You can sit with her and ask her to tell you about her day in English, but don’t interfere in how she communicates with her mother. Her mother is basically her only source of German. Your daughter will end up speaking English more due to where you live, so she needs as much exposure as possible to the one source she has for German.

Maybe you're right. Or maybe you just don't know any adults who have come out to you - it's the same as being gay was a while back, where as younger generations came out because it got more accepting, the argument older generations always used was 'but no one our age is gay.' *Even if* no one else you know is NB, that doesn't mean your child isn't - why are they old enough to know they're cis but not old enough to know they're NB?

> But he was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and he takes hormones and he got surgery. 

Would like more trans voices to chime in here, but your nephew's situation isn't that of every trans person. Not everyone goes through severe gender dysphoria or gets surgery. Not everyone can afford to take hormones or get gender confirmation surgery or even get diagnosed, but that doesn't stop them from being trans. 

Beyond that, what does your nephew have to do with anything? He's trans, not non-binary. Your child is in a different situation - there's no hormones or surgery ""fix"" here that I know of. They told you less than 24 hours ago, they haven't exactly had the time to get a psychiatrist to diagnose them. And even if they had, that shouldn't be a pre-requisite of acceptance - trusting them shouldn't be this complicated.

> so I didn't want them to be embarrassed by not identifying as the way they do right now later, because they made such a big deal out of it.

***YOUR CHILD JUST CAME OUT TO YOU.*** Your reaction should have been support, not an immediate quest for invalidation.

Here's what you did:

**Child:** I'm NB

**You:** Don't worry or be embarrassed if you change your mind!

Since you claim to be accepting of LGBTQ+ people, change NB to gay or lesbian in your mind and tell me you didn't fuck up.

Even if you're right and this is 'just a phase,' your blatant lack of support has probably destroyed any trust they had in you when they chose to come out. So you're definitely not going to be the first (or 10th, or 20th) port of call if they ""change their mind.""

YTA. You fucked up.

If you're a decent parent and father, now you try to rebuild, un-fuck up, and regain your child's trust. The problem being, your fuck up was at one of the most important moments of their life, and IDK how they can ever trust you completely again. i know if I was them? I wouldn't."

co1j97,"NTA. In my state in the USA, a 15 year old needs to have ""working papers"" filed with their school, signed by the student, their parents, and the manager of the place where they will be working.  A part time job is no small thing to manage for a 15 year old.  It can certainly be a growth environment for some students, but the concern is that it will interfere with studies and therefore college placement.  You might be better off waiting a few years and your parents should know better."

co1xg8,"NAH

But one important thing about family, in my opinion, I think in situations where someone is upset about something you don't care about, it's best just to give them lip service and make them feel like you're at least meeting them halfway.

Give him like an hour a week to throw a fuckin' ball around with you or whatever he wants to do, smile like you're having a great time, and overall you'll spend less time being bothered by this issue and the energy of the home will be more mellow."
co210e,NTA at all. You owe her NOTHING at all after the way she has treated you. I'm honestly shocked you were pressured into it in the first place.
co21qc,"ESH, because playing these kind of games in a car is dangerous.  I would have probably done the same thing though."
co21sr,"NTA. I get your wife's concerns, I do. But things like paintball and laser tag are games. They're fun teamwork exercises and good physical exercise and they are not in any way similar to mass shootings, in my opinion. While I have *many* feelings on the state of this country, I think freaking out over games (and video games) is letting fear win. It won't change anything, or stop any mass shootings.

co26ko,"NAH 

I’m 25 now, so from my current perspective this all seems pretty dumb. 

But...

I was a teenager once and I understand how, to young women, the boyfriend’s hoodie is kind of symbolic. Being able to wear it is like a privilege. Something special that only a gf can do. So I can understand why she feels weird about other girls wearing your hoodies."
co26o8,"ESH. It sounded like she was just concerned, but I understand why it could upset you, but you are acting like a teenager. And I don't see how your last paragraph relates to the issue at hand. There's a big difference between children and a 38 year old."
co29pr,">I admit I have more patience with my daughter

YTA for treating the children differently. 

You're not the asshole for being more fond of your daughter (you've presumably had her your whole life, and you aren't clear on how long you were parenting the stepkids before you married their dad 2 years ago but it's clear you weren't with them forever). It's normal for step-kids to cycle through confusing and negative emotions towards step-parents that appear later in their lives, and it's normal for step-parents to quietly feel frustration and annoyance. But it is NOT COOL to display this favoritism.

> the kids don't know I feel this way. My stepkids have tried to trick me to saying my daughter is the favourite

You say you think the kids don't know, but then blithely mention how they try to get you to ADMIT your true feelings? Lady... the kids know. Kids are perceptive, and step-kids come into these relationships *already fearing* that a step-parent like you won't ever like them as much as his or her biological kids. The dad noticed and so have they. 

Stop being an asshole and treat the kids fairly."
co2b09,"ESH

I'm not entirely sure I understand the whole situation because it's just bizarre, but your friend sucks for the constant flip flopping on her thoughts about your relationship with this guy, the guy sucks because he's a straight up asshole, and you suck for getting into this confusing mess in the first place. Why would you fly to meet someone's family/have them meet your family when you're planning to break up in four months? Why would you even pre-plan a breakup?"
co2d08,"NAH **[post-edit]**

Based on these replies I'm inclined to say this is a family that cares about each other and had some understandable miscommunication issues and raw emotions. Nobody was being cruel, just maybe a little unaware. No assholes here, just people making some mistakes but ultimately trying to do the right thing.

INFO

Have you ever talked to Carla about why she told your dad? You say he ""likely harassed her"" into telling him, which sounds like you actually don't know one way or the other. From what you said, your dad reacted ""okay"" but you're mad at him for a hypothetical badgering of your sister.

It just sounds like you're operating on a lot of hearsay and assumption here."
co2dco,"NTA - A dry food diet is absolutely fine, no problems there.  Also toys, my cat had all the toys under the sun but he only ever wanted to play with empty toilet rolls, throw him one of those.  The other points though are perfectly valid.

She was living there for more than a month. She owes for rent. That’s just a fact. This is cut and dry.

co2ohw,"NAH. She is in a very delicate and difficult place right now. She's not an asshole for asking, and she's not an asshole for being upset. Her world is very unstable at the moment. However, you make good points. You are an adult, and your living choices are yours. I don't blame you for not wanting to be there, if you know it would cause you both stress. Just be sure to remind you that you adore her very much, and that you're ready and willing to help her find a place in this new town and help her move. And offer to have a fixed day of the week where you come over and cook dinner or something. She needs reassurance right now."

co32l0,"YTA - gift giving should never be about whether or not someone “deserves” it it should be because you care about them and they are important to you. Your sister is 12 she’s going through all kinds of major and weird changes and I’m guessing if you really paid attention 1. You acted similarly at that age and 2. She’s doing it to everyone not only you. Grow up, be the bigger person and just get your sister who I presume you love regardless of her actions lately the stupid present."

Also if you don't feel comfortable being around someone, you're free to not be around them. Family is only family as long they support each other and don't make them uncomfortable for what reasons whatsoever.

>Would I be the asshole to want this rule in place, no meat in the house, when we get our apartment together?

That's not a compromise.  Like if you want a separate mini-fridge or cookware and dishes and what not, fine.  But if it bothers you that much and being vegan is that important to you, then maybe you guys are now incompatible."
co3pp3,"NTA. It might be a way of your wife trying to save you from buying really expensive gifts as she knows that she earns more than you. 

Maybe next time instead of getting her a gift do something nice together, e.g a weekend break or a day out to somewhere you haven’t been before, that way you can both enjoy it, but don’t run the risk of getting the same present she bought herself."
co3q0d,"NTA, everyone else but you and your sister are, because that’s gross as fuck. What the fuck could someone who has (likely) travelled the world have in common with someone who is still in high school and lives with their parents? This is some Y’all Qaeda/Christian Taliban shit. Is his family giving your dad goats in trade for her? I’m all for giving love a chance, but I remember being 17 and I didn’t know my ass from my elbow. Almost no one I know who was sure they knew what they wanted at 17 is actually living/doing that now. Unless her only ambition in life is to be a baby factory/housekeeper with a part time job at Dollar General, this probably doesn’t end well. 

That said, she might eventually need help getting out of this situation, and you being the only sane one she knows, might be the one to help her. Don’t push her out of your life completely, even if you (obviously) disapprove of this.

**Edit:** I see the people defending [this fucking creep](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cmr3c6/aita_for_not_telling_my_26m_gf_20f_where_the/) a few days ago are also in here telling us it’s ok for a 28 year old man to marry a child. Great."

On the other hand, if this is how he is and how he treats you, do you really want to have a child with him? Do you really want to have him treat you like this for the rest of your life. I suggest sitting down and talking to him and perhaps couples therapy. If he can't treat you better than you may just want to consider parting ways."

co4g6q,"NTA clearly. You didn't say you'd cook it, and you reiterated that when she asked again. I wonder if her poor planning was to manipulate you into making the pizza for her.

My mom is the same kind of picky eater so I understand your struggle: anything with a pinch of black pepper is too spicy, anything on a large list of foods she doesn't like and she will refuse to eat it because picking around it still leaves the taste on the rest of the food. She expects people to make her a separate meal if they're cooking because the food she wants is ""easier to make"".

If it weren't for that, I'd consider that it would have been nice to start making the food for her since you had time, but knowing she'd be just as likely to rage on you for making it wrong means it probably wouldn't have even been worth the effort or appreciated."

co4pq5,"NTA. SIL is TA for undermining your parenting. You asked your daughter to stop, you explained why and what the consequences might be (“because she might get hurt”). She ignored you, as kids often do, and it’s sad that she got hurt. But you made sure she wasn’t hurt badly, reinforced the lesson, and you weren’t mean about it. That’s pretty good parenting and SIL needs to mind her own business.

co58nv,"YTA, but not a huge one. She was looking to decompress and you offered an alternative that wasn’t drinking. That’s fine; but it’s not necessary for you to offer your unsolicited advice on what you think her drinking rules should be.

The way you framed it would have come off negatively to someone who’s already sensitive about her own breakdown."
co5chc,"YTA for not owning your own life and decisions like a grown fucking woman 

And if you seriously think your marriage fell apart because you didn’t change your last name and asked your husband to stand up to his mom, then the marriage wasn’t strong in the first place.

And if you decided to ration sex for no reason, that is 100% on you.  First, I don’t even believe your friends told you to do that because it doesn’t make any sense and they’re not doing it themselves.  And second, it’s so obviously a ridiculous idea that you should have known better.  

Part of being an adult and making adult decisions is recognizing bad and hypocritical advice and making your own choice whether to follow it  

It is SO BLATANTLY OBVIOUS from the letter that you’re just desperately looking for someone to blame for your marriage falling apart, and desperate to believe that it was nothing to do with you or your husband.  Your friends seem like a convenient scapegoat right now.  

Go ahead and cut them out if they’re malicious people who purposely give you bad or hypocritical advice.  But do yourself the most important favor of your life and take a hard look at your own self, or the next time won’t be any better"

She's meeting new people and experiencing things she missed out when she was younger so you got to excuse a little bit of bullshit.

You made the effort and sacrifices to try and make her meet new friends with your group but now the effort isn't being returned.

Oh boy, the text debate. I'm on the verge of NAH but I'm going with NTA because it's etiquette to reply unless he's genuinely busy.

Your mom isn't an asshole for wanting you to stay; you know however much she says it's okay it sometimes isn't

But you definitely are not the asshole for wanting to rejoin, and your mother's right. Do what you think is best."
co6opf,"YWBTA. If you take it you're preventing your coworkers from coming back and getting it, like you did with yours. The cleaning crew gets a pass because if they don't take it they're the ones who would be throwing it in the trash. You would just be taking advantage."
co6q4u,"YTA he’s not aggressive or violent, if he was it’d be a different story, let other people decide for themselves."
co6r27,NTA. It’s your speech. Do what you want with it. Someone (assuming inadvertently) hijacked your speech with a fart. It would be kind of difficult to recover from that.
co6s18,"NTA

When I was 17 my father offered to buy me the frame for a nice classic car.  The idea was that he and I would work on the car together, build it...and get to spend quality father son time together.  I passed up this opportunity for dumbass reasons.  Four years later he died from lung cancer at fifty.  In much of those four years I was away in other parts of the nation far from him.  When I heard the news I felt like a complete idiot.

tldr:  don't pass up an opportunity to spend more time with your father, if he is a good guy whom you love.  You never know when you will lose him."
co6sis,"YTA.

You have to be able to _afford_ morality."
co6v0c,"So when the check arrives, that’s when you’re just about to leave. This woman ate for half an hour longer, meaning she only kept you half an hour by eating slowly.

You’re prioritizing 30 minutes of inconvenience over your wife’s close friend.

I understand the irritation, but you’re still being an ass. A small one.

YTA.

EDIT: A lot of people seem to be assuming I’ve never encountered this situation. I have. It can be annoying. But it’s nowhere near as unbearable as folks are making it out to be.

Unless OP has left out that they have somewhere scheduled to be after and this woman is causing them to miss it, I fail to see how this is so horrible of this woman. It’s not long, everyone is still talking. I think it is selfish for OP to entirely exclude a close friend of his wife before even considering a less nuclear option, such as just asking the woman beforehand if she’d mind cutting her meal a little shorter once everyone is ready to leave."
co6wqq,"Given her COPD, she really should not be smoking. And if you don't want to enable a bad habit, you shouldn't have to. If she can't even walk around the corner to a store, that's another sign she needs to stop. If she's that desperate, your sisters can get it for her.

also worth nothing: ""You don't want to spend time with me! So I'm not gonna spend time with you!"" Where is the logic here."
co75cq,"NAH. If it’s not right for you, the worst thing you can do for *everyone* involved, is to stick around. 

They might not realise it, but if your heart isn’t in it with them, then you are better off elsewhere, and they are better off without you. If they have trouble recruiting to replace you, well that’s not your fault - it’s just something they need to figure out."
co77g7,"NAH. Coming from a disabled person. Some days I'm thankful for others help and other days I can't help but think that I'm disabled, not helpless. A good rule of thumb though is if you offer to help and they flat out say no take them at their word. I'd say ""I think I can manage"" falls under that umbrella as if she did need assistance I'm sure she would have asked instead of struggling and hurting herself.

It's a learning experience since not everyone has come into contact with disabled individuals and it's good of you to ask."

co7ab4,NTA. This is weird I don't care if they're best friends or not.
co7e2m,"NTA - number 1 is debatable, but number 2, where he is physically intimidating and blocking you needs to be addressed by HR.  I am fully supportive of giving work to the disabled - but that doesn't mean that anyone gets a pass at physical intimidation."
co7ga2,"NTA. Boundaries are important. Your grandmother sounds like a piece of work, bless her heart."
co7grx,"NTA, commitments are commitments. If I went out and got fucking arrested tonight, I'd still be expected to show up to work tomorrow."
co7mu4,YTA - there's no such thing as a direct line to a CEO. It's probably to his secretary or assistant who doesn't get paid enough to handle a situation like that.
co7mx9,"NTA for being angry that he harbors hidden distrust instead of talking to you about it. However, denying sex because your child isn't old enough? That seems a bit odd and is probably influencing his behavior.

I mean, not having sex because you are healing, or it is painful for you, or you don't have desire, or you're pissed at him for distrusting you, or that sort of thing... That seems reasonable. But exactly how old should a child be before their mother has sex? I must be missing something here."
co7p12,"YTA

>if a manager hasn't said anything, it shouldn't matter.

yup."
co7v4x,"Nope. Not even close, NTA. The kid is, but I assume he is because his mother is too and allows him to be like this.

It's not his house, permission should be asked and kid should be respectful. All of this wasn't carried out, so no, not your guys problem."
co7xpr,ESH. Y’all acting like a bunch of babies.
co7yv8,"NTA. You're over the relationship, and it sounds like she isn't. Considering her history of gaslighting and control issues you'd be totally justified blocking her."
co7zvr,[deleted]
co81zk,"NAH they just genuinely want to try to connect with you and talk.  But you just like to be alone, there isn't anything wrong with that."
co82g5,"YTA, you violate social decorum by filming someone, without their knowledge in a place they felt their privacy should have been respected. Then you share the video to people in an effort to embarrass him. So you big time asshole.  You might have a future job with TMZ."
co82vr,NTA. I wouldn't be surprised if her joke was a mask for her own dissatisfaction in the bedroom and that's why she took your comment the way she did.
co843s,"NAH. It would be polite to say something though - maybe along the lines of, ""Nice to meet you. Best of luck in your new job/country/life*.""

*delete as applicable"
co89ou,"NTA - but an absolute twit for lending someone who hasn't paid you $2000 back over 19 years another $3500.

Speaking of which can you lend me $3000, because you stand more chance of getting the money back out of me."
co8bi1,"NTA. Seems like a massive overreaction on their part. They enjoyed the meal, what's the big deal?"
co8c30,NTA. Don't know what's wrong with your mom?!
co8cf0,"YTA

You were a dick for no reason. Grow the fuck up."
co8dqb,"Nah - I mean this in the kindest way possible, I think both you and your mother would benefit from talking to a professional.  It sounds like you've fallen into a sort of pseudo-marriage, and a deeply unhappy one at that."

Fuck. Him/Her. He/She doesn't get to decide that the dog gets to sleep in the room AND not have a white noise machine.


>When I try to redirect the dog, SO feels like I’m not being nice to the dog.

See above.


>I’ve gotten a pretty severe ear infection from the use of the ear plugs.

This is not normal in any way. I'm glad you've seen a doctor, but coming from someone who's had multiple ear surgeries, not to mention infections, something is wrong here. I assume you've already discussed this with the doctor, but I imagine you were just reusing disposable earplugs or not washing reusable ones.

The dog isn't the problem, it's a symptom of an unloving, unwilling to compromise asshole of an SO."
co8m6n,"NTA. He's living for free in your house, I would ask him to help out too if it was on mine. He can buy gloves himself if he wants. They're not that expensive."
co8pe7,"NTA. She turned the tables on you.

You have your own life, she can't expect you to drop everything for her wedding."
co8pf9,NAH. You can't force feelings. You're doing the best you can.
co8po3,"NAH. He just wants to make some money since he's going on a trip. Nothing wrong with that. You denied him because you're saving up to pay rent. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that either. Ultimately, neither of you are assholes and you're both being perfectly reasonable."
co8tyk,"NTA

If you want to split bills, you should decide on the modalities upfront. It's also a really ugly move to shame you into paying for the gas. 

Moreover, they cannot expect to buy food themselves and then put the costs on you. If they want you to pay for the food, you should have at least equal right to choose what to buy."
co8u8a,NTA - but super fucking insecure.  Yeesh.
co8wyu,"NAH - Some people with disabilities find it offensive when people just assume they can't do something and help with without asking. You helped him without being assertive and he got in the door, no harm no foul."
co9122,"NAH. They need consistent care, and with your health problems you aren't able to give it to them. And you have every right to go to a job that is better for your current situation. It's a sucky situation, but in my opinion, no one is TA"
co91hg,"NAH

Your statement was quite clear. You should probably better explain the reason for why you seperate from them. But the point that they left was probably totally unrelated to you. I wouldn't be worried, and i am sure there isn't going to be any bad blood."
co97md,"NAH If this happened exactly the way you say. I would like to hear her side of the story, because if you’re gone 12 hours a day, every day, with no breaks, then she’s essentially a single parent and it’s understandable that the house is messy. At the same time, it’s understandable that you’d be frustrated. You better be bringing in mega bank to be missing your kid growing up like this, if so, perhaps a housekeeper could be hired to help with deep cleaning every once in a while to give you both a break."
co98ns,YTA. Why is his sex life any of your business? Why did you feel the need to be an ass instead of respect his privacy?
co990l,NAH - you even call them to see if they need you to pick them up after. You're the man of the situation. Always have a plan B. Did anyone make you feel that way ?
co9bvf,NTA having a dog in public means you need to control the dog in public. You tried to get her attention before the situation escalated and she rudely ignored both you and her dog.
co9euz,"NTA
I dont even need to read the description to know you were not in the wrong here 
Theres a time and a place for acupuncture and in a restaurant is not it."
co9gc4,"NTA. Two weeks notice is more than sufficient for them to find a replacement. On top of that, if your own boss is making you lie, you have every right to leave and walk out today if you wanted to."
co9iut,"YTA. Just spend $50 on Amazon if you plan on replacing the gift card, and remind her you have it."
co9klx,"Really.. He's hogging the laptop over solitaire? Surely.. There's online versions he can play on his macbook. Just Google 'Online solitaire' And get him playing it on his macbook.  
  
NTA  
  
EDIT: Google literally has a solitaire game built in."
co9o3k,"ESH. He probably deserved it, but it still makes you an asshole. Also, your response probably isn't going to inspire the level of introspection you were hoping for."
co9q41,"YTA for perpetuating negative stereotypes about a culture to which you do not belong. It's one thing to tell your kids there are cultural differences--it's another to give them a grocery list that starts off with such profound, obviously-true, and not-at-all-biased insights as

>Asians take a more cold and practical approach to raising families than Westerners do

Your kids just wanted to know why they can't play with their friends, and you took the opportunity to rant about ""Asian"" culture."
co9qzh,"NTA! I too would love a kid-free Disney trip. Drinking around the world in Epcot? Yes please!
No whining? Eating what you want, when you want, without having to share? Riding the big rides with no ride-swapppng? 
YESSSSS PLEASE.

But if you go you must also do a day at Universal!"
co9tar,"YTA. You basically told your friend that being with her is the same as masturbating at home alone. 

Do you want to be the kind of person who talks shit about their friends and loved ones behind their backs, or the kind of person who backs their friends and family even when they’re not around?  If you’re the former, they’re not really your friends and you don’t have any loved ones."
co9tbo,NTA and I'm not sure why your family took offense. It should have been easy to exchange.
co9u9y,NTA easiest NTA I think I've ever made.
co9vox,"NAH. Being a parent doesn't mean that your life has to revolve around your kids for the rest of your life. 

Just be prepared for both your wife and daughter to be pissed at you if she does go into early labor and you miss it."
coa046,"NTA

Fuck Mary. Tell her to change her name to Karen because it suits her better."
coa1hu,[deleted]
coa1nr,"NTA. I also have pretty severe depression and anxiety, so I understand why this is so tough for your friend, but because she confirmed that very morning that she was going to do it I'll say she's TA here. Also people blaming you for her mental breakdown are being TA as well, no friend should feel obligated to take care of another friend's mental illness."
coa5dh,"YTA.

Ignoring the 'I am a better parent' spiel that you went on there, for just a moment, her daughter was basically dangerously ill from drink and drugs and you chose to play cool nursemaid instead of trusting her own mother to look after her or decide whether it was time to go to hospital?

You assumed she would be angry and confrontational. You didn't give her a chance to look after her daughter and be the cool, understanding parent? Instead you embarrassed her by parenting her child because you think she isn't good enough to do it and then act surprised when she doesn't want to hang around to hear how much of a better mum you are?"
coa658,"YTA. Given the lengthy nature of this post, I'm inclined to believe your manager's accusation that you were whining. 

Go to HR if you're bothered by the physical interaction.... but it seems like you've included that detail as more of a ""look how much of an asshole my manager is, I was so right to tell him off"" and less of a ""my manager's behavior is unprofessional and I don't know how to make him stop."""
coa7ex,"As someone who once was a German teenager and is now a still German adult, NTA. We can drink at 14 in our homes, under parental supervision. Beer and wine are legal to buy at 16. 

Hard liquor is technically not allowed at 17 (everything's legal at 18), but to be honest, I've never met a German person who drinks and didn't down vodka at 15.

We're used to it. His parents were ok with it. And since this sub only questions morality and not legality, I will stand by my opinion that you did nothing wrong.

Especially since he was in a supervised and safe environment."
coa8fp,"YTA 

1. You don’t know what she was dealing with that day. I was going to mention not having children, but that doesn’t even matter. Even fellow parents don’t know just how bad her situation was at the moment.
2. Your initial plan didn’t even involve including her or any other friends. How badly did you want her there?
3. Sounds like your being an immature brat whose pissed someone placed their child’s well being ahead of your party."
coa8te,"NAH. I get why you're father's upset since he probably wants to feel like he's been a good dad on his deathbed, but you don't owe him anything.

That said.....you might regret not saying goodbye, and you really have nothing to lose by popping by for a few hours."
coab4c,"YTA. ""Intern"" doesn't equal ""free labor."" Interns are, by definition, inexperienced and need to be trained. *They* need to be getting something out of the experience, too. Mistakes come with the territory.

If you don't have the time or patience to train her, you shouldn't have agreed to take her on as an intern."
coabac,[deleted]
coabzl,"NTA- Its super creepy that he followed you, and then waited 2 HOURS to give you ONE dollar. That's not normal behavior, and you were very much in the right to freak out. I'm 22f, and I dont open my door for strange men either."
coadlz,NTA.  Completely reasonable.
coaj07,"NTA, that's incredibly unreasonable to expect you to drop the trip.

It was planned in advance and there's money involved. She should suck it up that the timing doesn't work out and plan a time that does."
coajy4,"NTA I thought this was going to be about refusing to testify something in court, but a podcast? What’s that going to achieve other than identify yourself to the world... 

He may be a terrible person but you are doing the right thing, no good can come of that. You’ve already been involved talking to the police and that’s the best you can do."
coanby,"YTA - you wanted the gossip. 

Tanner said he didn't want to talk about it and from your information Kaitlyn cannot determine social cues correctly. It wasn't her story to tell and obviously causes issues for Tanner, likely more now that your whole family will hear in glorious detail about his father's affair from naive kids.

Kids are curious, I get that, but they need to be taught tact and that some information is private. There was nothing stoping you from asking Kaitlyn in a more private setting but that would still make you YTA because you wanted the goss."
coao3c,"NAH, they want to make it more of a family thing, you obviously want to have some bonding time with your brother. I’d say if at all possible try and compromise so your trips overlap by a few days but you get some time to catch up by yourselves as-well as whole family time"
coapt8,NTA.  It wasn't yours to share.  And this wasn't relevant to your relationship.
coas47,NTA she hit your car and is driving without insurance. She should be responsible for her actions.
coask0,"NTA. Good god, who are these people? 3-5 miles is NOT a “short walk” and they also should have been considerate of the fact that you were improperly dressed for it."
coaudv,NTA - You’d be doing the future child a favor by saying something. I’d probably just “accidentally” say something about it and then act surprised that MIL didn’t already know.
coawdo,NTA. He acts like my 10 year old niece.
coaxnc,"NTA. He sounds like a dick. And it sounds like he doesn’t make you feel better at all. If he can’t share any empathy, he needs to not say anything or ask what’s wrong."
coayw4,"NAH. I mean, it doesn't make you an asshole, but I don't get why you don't want to? Donate to a school and let them decide whether they're good enough to use - I always used a crappier instrument for marching season so I could keep my other one in good condition for concert season."
coazqm,NTA. Why doesn’t your coworker let him stay if he’s so worried?
cob0lc,[deleted]
cob11l,"NTA. He is exploiting his role as a parent to try to guilt and shame you into forgiving the woman he cheated on your mom with! If the mistress was a random woman from his job, it would be easier but she knew your mom personally and still backstabbed her!

Your dad is TA."
cob3iy,Tbh you both kind of sound racist?
cob7ec,"NAH I understand where your ex friend is coming from trying to stay in the loop with your life if she desires to be friends with you still; not that it’s right or mature, but I don’t think it’s “asshole” of her to want to be your friend as long as she’s not purposely causing you trouble.

That being said, why don’t you just block her on your own stuff? I understand you might feel guilty but having her added on your stuff is definitely a bad idea.


Edit because I misread part of post"
cob7i5,"NTA -- but you'd better be real fucking sure that the fallout will definitely land squarely on him. People like this tend to be good at shifting blame, so you'd better be really sure there's no chance he can get out of this or, worse, shift blame onto you (which, if your characterization of him is accurate, he will 100% attempt to do)."
cob7xs,"YTA

Imagine telling them to their faces you're too fat for my furniture."
cobbcl,[deleted]
cobbdo,"NTA and you’re pissed at her for exactly the right reasons. Mormonism is at worst a cult and at best a really shitty actively homophobic, transphobic and misogynist institution. Fuck people for supporting them and fuck thinking you have to be tolerant of their wackadoodle views because it’s a “religion”."
cobbm6,NTA. It’s good you stood up for the kid. You should always do that. No stranger should ever get physical with a child. Good job
cobjxo,"Oh snap. My friend does the exact same thing. Whenever she says or does something that I respond iffy to, she says “do you think I’m mean,” or “am I weird”. Haven’t talked to her in a while and it’s benefited me. It really depends though. Does she have other people she can rely on?"
cobmpd,"Never too long to reach out ..... I always love hearing from former students. Maybe lead by acknowledging quite some time has past, why it has been so long since you reached and and saying you dont want to lose anymore time. Hope it goes well."
cobnv1,"ESH.

Obviously this guy should pay you the money back. 

But also don't air your dirty laundry on Facebook, it always looks trashy."
cobtxv,NTA. The asshole here is the american medical system.
cobtzq,NTA you are completely justified in thinking that she is selfish and will try to hurt you again. In my experience toxic friends don't usually change and keep repeating their actions. Some people just aren't worth the drama of keeping around.
cobuik,"NTA - she changed plans, you already have plans, not fair of her to ask you to drop something like that. Plus, so many other people will be attending I doubt it will affect her party if one person doesn't show up. If she throws a fit then she is the asshole. If not then NAH"
cobuzt,"YTA - I know it's their fault for screwing up the order, and you have every right to avoid the place.  But purposefully flushing food down the drain because you want to play Victorian lunch with the Pope is an unnecessary inflexibility."
cobxmr,NTA - it's hilarious they are saying you are making a bid deal out of it and ruining the friend group when they will do jack shit to contribute.
cobyza,NTA - Beggars can't be choosers.  And flip flop flaking is the worst.
coc0k7,NTA. Rude old woman shouting at you in the bathroom was
coc1bn,NTA for asking roommate to have her over less. But saying she shouldn't come over at all is over the top. He should be allowed to have friends/girls over just like everyone else. Within reason.
coc3ui,NTA she is really trying to get you in trouble there. you were just being human and telling her to stop her behavior
coc7aa,"NTA.  Trust your gut and report it.  Those poor animals are living painful lives

Edited to add:  try calling your local animal control to see what can be done.  If it were me, I wouldn’t talk to Anne first since she didn’t do anything while knowing the situation.  She’s basically an enabler at this point"
coc7i8,"ESH except your little sister. It doesn’t sound like you were doing anything to justify your older sister snapping at you, but leaving without telling anyone is over dramatic and does make it all about you. Could have just politely let them know that you were leaving before heading out."
coc9lf,"Absolutely NTA. That's how the system works and you're completely within your rights to make the most of it. You're entitled to that pay, don't feel guilty about it."
coc9ny,"YTA. Why the hell are you enabling abuse? Your mother is an abuser. If your uncle helps her get custody back because you stayed silent, anything that happens to your sister is partially on you. Report your mom to police. FFS!"
coc9qa,YTA for being ungrateful for your roommate looking out for your dog. Calling twice to see if he’s eaten even though she only has 15 minutes? Letting him out to pee? Texts you to confirm she fed him? Good on her. Don’t blow it.
cocaez,"NTA. I come from a family of alcoholics and I can tell you right now, you will end up a lot better emotionally and mentally stable if you go limited/no contact with him. It isn't selfish to want to be respected, and it isn't selfish to cut out toxic people. Tell him how you feel while he's sober, tell him your requirements, whatever they may be, that he must meet if he wants you in his life, and last but definitely not least see a therapist. You'll need a professional to help you through this because it will be hard to go through without support. I wish you the best,"

cocj40,NTA. Tell Karen you can wear whatever you want and the world doesn't revolve around her.
cocpeh,"YTA. It’s one thing to dance well at a wedding, as your title says, but completely out of bounds to do ARIALS, as seen in your comments, on a dance floor. That’s not welcoming dance behavior, it’s intimidating. You may know what you’re doing, but other people may be worried about being hit by a leg or a stray shoe. That’s for professional dance events, not a wedding unless you’re specifically asked to do so. Have a little common sense.
Oh wait, no, you were showing off at a WEDDING and making it about your great dance skills."
coct0n,NTA as long as that $200 isn’t coming out of your mother’s disability money. He lost his right to share his family name with you imo.

cod0ie,"NAH

My friends do that to me (sometimes) and vice versa. But we understand because we both have busy schedules so nobody takes it personally. Actually if we don't hear from the other person we just kind of assume ""They must be busy so I'll call them later"". I wouldn't beat yourself up about it."
cod34b,"Just offer next time. He probably just doesn't like decisions being made on his behalf. It's degrading. He's a grown man, he's gone through an entire lifetime at this point.

cod66r,"YTA, the teacher was wrong. Transsexual is an outdated and offensive term, and the word transgender has NO connotation related to where someone is in their transition process. It just means “someone who doesn’t identify as the gender they were assigned at birth.”"

coddts,"ESH - it’s a guest bedroom for a reason. anyone can use it. however, it seems like your sister is hanging out in there just to spite you."
codeb1,"NTA but hide your things in your room and install a lock for your bedroom door, that way you’ll be sure that he doesn’t take your things. Also don’t blame the child, it’s not his fault for being raised that way, you can see the results of that parenting in your roommate. She’s TA for not respecting your rules."
codfbg,Does it really matter?🤦🏽‍♂️
codg10,"YTA if these people are truly friends and not just coworkers or acquaintances.   Unless it's some kind of emergency,  letting friends know ahead of time seems like the right thing to do."
codj6r,"YTA if you invite him **without** trying to sort things out with your twin first.  Because you *know* its going to cause a drama and just burying your head in the sand isn't going to help things.  Do you *really* just want to invite him and then have a massive drama on the day?  

You aren't an asshole for *wanting* your brother at your birthday.

Your twin isn't an asshole for *not* wanting him there (but ffs, they are turning 50!).

You both need to have an actual conversation about this.  At the end of the day, (as sad as it might be) if you can't *agree*, then maybe you need to have separate birthday parties."
codlhm,NTA - your brother shouldn't be surprised the wedding plan they used to deter people from coming to things is deterring people from coming to things.
codmse,[deleted]
coduhx,NTA but this should have been taken care of a lot sooner. Going to court with people like you described will only end up losing you time and money. Not helping someone pay off something that's on YOUR credit is where you made your biggest mistake. (aside from the mistake of the original decision to 'help' this low life scum). I've been in a few legal battles in my life and I know first-hand that it's just a waste. The lawyers will be the only ones who benefit.
codvpw,"YTA it’s just kind of distasteful. You forgot and made other plans okay, but like who doesn’t have a calendar or put things on their phone? Do what you gotta do, but get a calendar."
codxcy,"NTA

You gave them all a warning.  Not only that, but offered a better living space, and for the same space.  I think that's way more generous and convenient.  I would've gone with YTA had there been no warning, or offer."
codzsn,"Not an asshole for the first half (moving in with parents), but going with the YTA judgement because of the grad school thing.  End of the day it's his future and if it's something he wants to do then better sooner than later, there will always be a reason that it isn't the right time yet."
coe78v,"NTA but stop calling it a date. Thats what makes it weird. No one refers to hanging out with a friend as a ""date""."
coef07,"NAH

They did post 12 so you're still in the right."
coeffj,NTA and report it to FB. They might take it down for you.
coehm8,"NTA. BIL is the asshole here. He had no right to talk to you like that. 

He seems controlling, judgemental, unreasonable and convinced he is correct. Watch out for your sister and read up on narcissism."
coejna,"NTA - If your guests mess something up, then it's on you to clean it and no one else. Also assuming you're American, the culture around work in this country sucks. The fact that he berates you for not working 50-60 hours a week is ridiculous."
coek2q,"NTA! Hell no, that is a huge invasion of personal space and to top it off they basically walk all over you. What I say is lock the doors or something to keep them closed, you would also want to discuss with your parents as to why you're doing this, to avoid any complications."
coekeo,ESH for doing for her. She need to do the work. Help her/ tutor her sure but dont do it for her
coel7s,"NTA 

Really hate it when people say ""just suck it up"" when they in fact can do the same. 

They clearly doesn't understand the situation and maybe it needs more explaining to get them to understand."
coen46,"NTA.

Being 4 hours late (and repeatedly late by different amounts of time to everything) is ridiculous. I am notorious for being late to hangout with my friends, but 4 hours? Hell, even longer than 10 minutes and I’d feel like an ass. I’d have gone off on him by now if I was you. I’m surprised you somehow still tolerate it."
coenfe,NTA. Cut toxic family loose. You owe them nothing.
coeqbp,Nope. NTA. a lack of manners is the asshole move. Chewing with your mouth open is an ass move
coerto,"NTA. Where do you live? Its a crime in some places to upskirt people.

I mean legally, you did the wrong thing. But I dont think youre an arsehole. If you'd told your teacher she wouldnt have been able to do anything about it, unless she demanded to see the snapchat which I cant imagine happening and probably would've given you a vague answer.

He totally deserved it, well done you!

And your friend is being an arsehole, ""it probably wasnt like that"" what bs. If you know you saw him filming girls in class and he upskirted them, how could you misinterpret that?"
coexq4,"NTA. those girls may not have cared, but what about next time when there’s nobody there to defend them? When there’s nobody else around to see? You did the right thing"
coezus,"If you do this ESH

Never let toxic people make you into a toxic person"
cof223,"Management is TAH. They didn't have the balls to actually speak to the guy about everyone's complaints. We have a similar problem with a stinky colleague. I see why he was embarrassed but you did it in a private and fair way I think.

NTA"
cof43u,NTA what could you have really done to change your father's action? Your dad sucks and he's TA in the story and no one else. All you can do is give your sister patience and space while she hopefully learns to overcome the childhood damage your father not you put on her.
cof47s,"NTA. If your employer directs you to be somewhere other than your usual place of employment for their convenience, they should be covering travel."
cof5gh,"NTA - I'm going with this because your dad was unkind. You make them tea two or three times a day, they get your meds once a day, seems like a reasonable setup. Not making the tea once is fine, to make that point, because that respect is a two way street, if you just said nope not doing it again at all, that would make you the AH.

EDIT: Cleaned up the way it sounded"
cof5k9,"NTA.

It sounds to me like your friend is using his DID as a way to manipulate you to get free shit. I'm even wondering if he really has a disorder, or if that isn't some edgy manipulative fashion statement.

And if it's real, then he's a shitty friend for not caring about something you can have when he can't.

Do you really have to be friends with this dude?"
cof644,"NAH.

You and your girlfriend joke about it and that's cool. But her mum probably went through absolute hell watching her kids arm get cut off and seeing someone take it all lightly and mocking/teasing her for it is probably going to be upsetting to her.

Your girlfriend is right. Know your audience."
cofcvg,"NTA. As her primary guardian it’s important for you to lay down the law when necessary. The cross-country is a privilege, and by acting out she is revoking her right to it. Since you clearly don’t trust her mom to actually parent her, I’m a little surprised that you were initially allowing the visit at all given that it’s a big step from supervised local visits to flying across the country alone."
coffkf,"YTA if you weren't trying to get a reaction, what were you trying to do?  Can you explain the joke to us and where she is supposed to find humor?"
cofhz1,"NYA it’s not s big deal to say “oh, she left, can you move to the next song”, right?"
coflpc,"YTA.  If the brother is constantly making digs about the future wife then your son is just respecting her feelings. **It's their wedding, not yours.**

Giving money to help out does not change that. Refusing to be there shows your son that you think your other son isn't  saying anything inappropriate.

Edit: word spelling"
cofmdj,"For sure it’s a rude thing to do and the whole class paid.  Get angry at her, but then let it go because it’s not that big of a deal and you still went on a nice hike.  

NTA"
cofpb8,She told you no now she flirting cuz she want what she can't have. YWBTA uf you strung them both along pick one.
cofvmb,NTA no reason you have to reply.
cofxy4,"NTA, that feature exists in the app and it’s part of his job to expect that as a possibility. He was being unprofessional"
cofy6s,"NTA, and in fact once you no longer depend on them it may be good to tell them. It could go two ways: they could disown you (in which case good riddance) or they could see the error of their ways (in which ways you can start recovering the relationship). If you don't tell them you'll still keep these negative feelings about their behavior."
cofzta,NTA but you should work on your excuses lol. Like you could’ve said that you have a sickness and such
cog16e,"YTA - this wasn't the first time he's met her, he knows what she looks like by now, so what if she poses for instagram. Is it really that big of a deal."
cog46s,"NTA

> She has kids too, and I always get her something for her on HER birthday

Start giving her clothing for her kids on her birthday."
cog8nq,"NTA, these are the kind of conversations people really need to have before getting married. You’re in the right for wanting her to decide on a game plan before you’re legally tied to each other so that you can make financial/life plans well in advance for both of your sakes.

It sounds like she’s free to choose whatever she wants to do? You’re being pretty reasonable and not at all controlling about it so I don’t really see where the “not giving her freedom” thing comes in."
cogky2,"YTA.  Not hugely, I get 2 weeks with even nice in laws can be a lot, especially if you have anxious or introvert tendencies.  But your wife hasn’t had a visit home in 2 years and by the sound of it your in laws have been nothing but generous and pleasant.  I think you’ve let your frustrations get the better of you, apologise to your wife."
cogn9n,NTA maybe offer to plan a day of the week to drive together tho
cogp3f,"NAH

I have a similar outlook and have relatives I don't talk with. However, I don't think your father is an asshole either. He probably wants you to be more connected to your Russian background and relatives are a part of that.
You don't have to pretend to care about them but you might do so just to placate your father. You probably speak Russian fluently but practice never hurts either."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
cogsv0,"YTA.  There could be a million reasons that she didn’t text back.  And you didn’t bother to follow up because you didn’t want to risk a double text.  

Friendships work best when there’s a little vulnerability.  Next time put yourself out there and reach out again.  If she doesn’t respond.. then you can be mad."
cogtc2,"YTA, you brought it up again weeks later? Wtf? Nothing even happened, no one got in trouble."
cogvir,NTA but why not explaining the real reason to them? They will feel that you are lying to them and guess wrong causes for your behavior. That will lead to resentment and argument for no good reason...
cogw0f,"NAH - That's good you want to help, but it's also not your responsibility to make sure they succeed. If they know about the tutorials and are electing not to go, then that's on them. If they want to get a masters, they'll need to have the drive to want to earn it themselves."
cogxw6,NTA you’ve posted that sign for a reason and her ass still came back a 2nd time. What’s wrong with having peace and quiet at your own home?
cogyfm,"NTA

There was no reason for you not to trust the gf. The guy's a major arsehole who cheated on his girl, you're not an arsehole for anything."
coh3xe,ESH. Your mom sucks because she can’t blame you for something that was her decision (and demand). You suck because the cat is a living being and maintaining its health isn’t optional.
coh5wy,"YTA.

Mattie broke up with you (after a month!!). Not Alan. She is a human with her own mind and decision making capabilities. She isn't a toy he stole from you.

Who says he was lying about what Mattie told him? From the little you've posted here, I would say she's a good judge of character."
coh9rc,[deleted]
cohbgo,"YTA if you tell your dad. Your sister trusts you enough to call you in a time of trouble, and that’s worth a lot. She probably feels super embarrassed by it by now, no reason to makes matters worse.

Haven’t we all did some stuff we don’t want our parents to know about? And didn’t we turn out just fine?"
cohdqj,"NTA

You didn’t ruin anything - they did.

Your birth parents have been and continued to be completely selfish arseholes, and everyone deserved to see who they really were.

The only people who upended anyone’s lives are your parents. You did not deserve to be told to go away or hidden."
coheg7,"YTA.
What’s the point of telling people that communication is key in a healthy relationship if they are just going to go ahead and do the exact opposite at the first opportunity?

He was remarkably and refreshingly direct and open with you about what he likes and doesn’t like, but you just chose to ignore it because you don’t get it, so you’re TA."
cohjse,"NTA - Saying ""that's just how I am"" or ""it's part of my personality"" doesn't give you a free pass to treat other people like shit. Being on your phone the entire time while having dinner is so rude and disrespectful, and then making excuses for the things that you criticized her for is even worse. She also criticized you just to re-inflate her ego and that's not okay."
cohjva,"ESH. Just slightly. Amy is taking over planning and needs to be sure of everyone’s feelings before forcing a situation on them. 

Having said that, it’s about the three of them getting to know each other as sisters. A couple of hours is fine for you - trust your wife to get what she needs out of the rest of the time. This isn’t about you, it’s about three sisters connecting. Let them control the tempo."
cohkx7,[deleted]
cohtwh,NAH. They are definitely not the assholes for not wanting to play a song about killing people. You aren't the asshole for writing it to vent so long as that is all it is.
cohv7p,"NTA, marriage is about compromise and she should be willing to take turns with you."
cohy7u,"YTA. Not for failing to tell them apart but for how you pushed the blame onto them for your failure to do so. Its your fault you haven’t figured it out or at least asked them how, its not their responsibility to wear a special sign for you."
coi54e,YTA. If he’s killing your mood just stop talking to him. It seems like you’re passive aggressively trying to morph him into a “fun” person.
coi5af,"NTA - it’s one thing to accidentally skip a few curse words and the kid picks up on it or even teach them just one and have it be a grandparent secret like getting an extra soda or candy, but it’s downright disrespectful to teach them a whole song and dance and having the kid perform it as though they’ve learned something valuable. Doubly so when you’ve got to go back and figure out an age appropriate way to explain some of the things grandpa taught them while also explaining that they shouldn’t use that kind of language."
coi6em,NTA you’re 14 years old... makes sense that you’d assume your dad would buy your icecream and that you would want the same size as everyone else.
coi9hp,"NTA - while the investment seed money is thoughtful and smart, it will never be as exciting as free diving. 

Others have said you should control your responses, but so can your gf. Getting excited over a gift is normal. Guilt tripping someone for being happy and excited is not."
coiag1,NTA. But honestly what more evidence do you need? He sounds like he knows you are going to stay. You could also message that friend and ask them if they know or just confront him and ask to see his phone. But overall none of this is healthy and it sounds not worth it.
coiaxe,NTA.  Never be “polite” when you feel that urge to run.
coie3w,"Jesus people, the question isn't ""Was Claire TA for throwing a ring in the river?"", the question was ""AITA for laughing at a story about Claire throwing a ring in the river?""

NTA. You found an absurd story funny and you laughed at it. Also NTA for finding that story funny, unless everyone who likes cringe comedy is also an asshole. 

The other guy didn't think it was funny. He doesn't have to. But he doesn't get to tell you that your sense of humor is objectively wrong and awful."
coie9r,"NAH. Your mother is allowed to re-evaluate her relationship with your father. However you are also allowed to let your evaluation your own relationship with him to stand.

That he has changed does not change the past. It does not change the way you were raised, it does not change the emotional neglect that you felt, it does not change the abuse that you experience.

If you don't want to be around him, you are 100% entitled to stay away from him. Your mother needs to respect your autonomy."
coifk8,"NTA.

1, looking after a child with these problems is often both financially and emotionally draining on the family... not least because you feel bad for any negative feelings you have towards your kid, even if you still love them.

2, let's be honest, from a purely LOGICAL perspective... all these problems are basically natures way of telling you maybe you shoulsnt have kids... in the sense that if this was 100 or more years ago the kid most likely wouldnt last long.

3, there is the quality of life of the child to consider.... not only the impact on their childhood but also lifelong. You can look after them now but what about when you're 60? 70? 80? Will they still need constant care? Will you be able to afford it? What if you cant?

Your concerns are 100% valid, justified and sensible. No one has a right to negatively judge you.

The ONLY YTA element of this is knowing all your problems and concerns... you managed to get accidentally pregnant. If I had those concerns I would take great care to avoid it until I was sure (unless your method of child prevention is e.g. the implant and you're super unlucky)

Edit: btw, your husband is TA for dismissing your concerns just to clarify that one."
coiflh,"NTA

Not your debt to pay. That’s a lot of money to lose for nothing."
coij2h,NTA. From the sounds of it the dog is being neglected and I don't see why you would be an ass if you get her out of this horrible situation by putting her up for adoption.
coij7b,"NTA. There is no way they haven't found a job. Either they're straight up mooching, or they have found work and are just lying to get more money to live beyond their means. I could understand if, like, they worked at someplace that doesn't pay a living wage, but from the information you've provided that basically can't be the case (and on the off chance it is, it sounds like they're asking for more than just what makes ends meet)."
coijvm,"NTA! He was driving therefore, his ticket. You definitely should be able to appeal this, though. Look into it!"
coik8b,"NTA

If you were frequently rotating men, he has a point. I would say it would be an unhealthy atmosphere.

This just sounds like jealousy though.

At the end of the day even if you were frequently rotating men, it’s your right to do, he would have to follow up in court with that."
coikte,"You really one upped that 13 yo dude. 

YTA."
coinb8,"YTA, maybe if you acted like an adult they’d treat you like one."
coindw,"YTA Yes you’re the asshole and your dads family are also assholes for having their celebration on her birthday. Hell, your dad is the asshole (and you again) for not insisting it be a different day so it doesn’t fall on the EXACT day of your moms birthday. I’d be feeling a bit sad if both my husband and offspring went to celebrate their own birthday or someone else’s when it’s not even the *day* of their birthday. At least if you spend time with your mom, you can still spend time with your dad on his actual birthday. Your moms special day is today, make her feel special."
coioe7,"NTA. You both sound like victims of circumstance. You can't do anything about it because the higher ups won't let you and you won't put another guest out for her. I can appreciate that. 

That said... she paid for a room that's in working order. It's well within her right to ask that everything in the room that she's staying in, and paying for, works properly. 

She's giving your hotel long term, guaranteed business. I would accommodate this person. 

Can you move her to a 100% working room and ask that she doesn't burn the oven light out by keeping it on? You could check around the office and see if there's a nightlight you can put in her room. I travel a lot and a most of the hotels I stay in have them. Just an idea."
coip8a,"YTA- she's having a tough time emotionally, her mother is sick. And on top of that's she's being weighed down by what sounds like 90% of the housework as well as cooking. She's 14. She's a child. It'd be understandable if you split the work load more evenly and she has down time to go see her friends. 

I get it's tough and medical bills suck and it's such an unfair hand you've been dealt. But she's 14. She's a kid and from the sounds of it isn't allowed to act like that once in awhile"
coipnt,"NTA but saying goodbye is a comforting or reassuring type of thing for your mom, or at least that's what it seems like. She probably just worries about you, that's all."
coirhj,NTA. She is being a bridezilla and enabling her isn't going to help. She needs to be considerate of those around her and your brother needs to think about if he wants to marry someone who behaves like this in a stressful situation.
coirk6,"NAH

I think the assholery cancels out so no one remains TA. 

She should have never asked you to save her spot, but you accepted out of kindness. Then, you bailed on her, but not due to anything but concern for the other guy (and your own potential well being).

I once tried to save a parking spot for a friend by standing in the spot. Some dude in a big truck turned the corner and just waved and laughed me out of the way. lol - that was a pretty A move on my part."
coisbk,NAH but I would have used that 10 specifically to buy her a beer as a thank you for the tickets.
coiwoi,"NTA, elderly people need privacy too. I also sleep in a room that isn't a bedroom so I sympathize with your grandma. Good for you for standing up for her!"
coiz6k,"NTA. He knew your schedule and knew you would show up. He was acting really childish by refusing to workout with you, and extremely rude when he constantly complained."
coizj5,"YTA. Big time..this is a big deal to her. I mean she had to go to therapy for it. Which you should of as well. And you almost left her once for it. I'm sure that still haunts her if she knows about it and then to make her biggest insecurity a joke? Not cool, she trusted you to make her feel safe and loved.  You dropped the ball."
coiznx,NTA. The guy who kept bitching for pizza should have been the one to pay for it. Period.
coizt9,[deleted]
coj0od,[deleted]
cojbcm,"NTA, she asked for your opinion and you gave it. However it seems like she wants to keep it and is looking for someone to support her decision on that seeing as her mother and the father don’t. Make sure she knows that even though you may not agree with her decision you will still support her in any way you can."
cojc1f,"NTA, they shouldn't have spoken for you and nor should you have allowed it."
cojc1k,"NTA

If the accident truly wasn’t your fault, as in you were hit without fault of your own, that’s why you have insurance. The fact that the other guy doesn’t is her problem, not to be mean about it. But it’s not yours."
cojdbi,"NTA but it doesn't sound like your fiance is really pushing for this? It doesn't need to be a big deal, just let him know you're not comfortable with it and don't want Alex in the wedding party because he wasn't respectful of your relationship. This wedding is about your shared love and you don't have to have someone standing up next to you that didn't stand up for your relationship."
cojeyv,"NTA but dude, you aren't getting that money back. 1. It was given freely as a gift. 2. You already know based on her personality she's not going to want to give you anything back just to be nice. Why are you thinking about doing something that's going to keep you tied to this person who treated you poorly? What ""principle"" would you even be standing on? The money wasn't a loan, you gave it to her. It's no longer yours, even if she broke up with you in a shitty way.

Cut your losses here and take this as a lesson in future not to spend money on someone that you're not willing to part with forever."
cojf7b,"NTA 

It takes strength to admit that the burden would be too much for you. Also, make *sure* the danger of abuse is real before ruling out a facility completely. There are many, many people out there receiving compassionate care."
cojgfg,"NTA. That sounds draining and ridiculous. Saying something like I'd prefer to talk once a week so I have more to say would be a nice way of saying I dont want to talk to you all the time if you're not trying to be rude, or I have a lot going on I'll talk to you in a few days. 

I dont think you're obligated to have idle one sided chit chat conversation daily with anyone that isnt listening to you... however I think it's a little asinine she does this and doesnt even pay any attention at all."
cojlnr,"YTA. Your reasoning is super controlling. If it was strictly money concerns, I’d vote differently

Being a maid of honor is a privilege but it’s also a job of sorts. Acting like she owes you 100% of her attention to the point where she can’t bring her own partner is shitty.

If you don’t mind him being at the reception, I don’t see what the deal is. Lay down expectations about who can be with you when you get ready and you won’t have a problem"
cojp1x,"NAH.

Your boss's schedule doesn't mean you have to work there longer. It shouldn't come off wrong."
cojst7,NTA- but your wife is. You were a kid who was taken advantage of by an older woman and then lied to you about the paternity of her child.
cojteg,[deleted]
cojtg4,"YTA
You should have told your friend, or told no one. Going behind her back and telling another friend is being a shitty friend."
cojuhg,NAH - it might be a little rude not to sit with them but i think your parents are nose blind.
cojwmw,"NTA 

That she didn't even ask why means she doesn't deserve for you to feel guilty."
cok00n,"YTA

You're projecting your own insecurities onto your girl."
cok0vd,"NTA, any dick pic of a minor is child pornography! It is illegal!"
cok4xu,"NTA - tell him. Considering your wife already knows about this and is keeping it mum, he’s gonna need some support through the process."
cok68f,"NTA GERD is no joke. try to express your appreciation in other ways, compliment her food etc, but don’t let people’s refusal to understand dietary restrictions push you into compromising your health"
cok7zx,"NTA, a bit petty but maybe you could start treating them the same way and see how quickly they leave you alone then"
cokeuj,"NTA - for whatever reason, your aunt decided to leave all of her money to you. Maybe because, exactly as you pointed out, he’s more secure financially. However, this wasn’t your call, and does not justify your brother manipulating you using his depression as leverage into giving him “his” half of the money. Do with it as you see fit, and if he does ice you out of your social circle - those people were never your friends anyway."
coklpn,NTA you drove miles for that and for 6 $ value he goes ballistic?? Ffsake
cokmcz,"I never got this whole “manipulate kids into doing what you want them to do, unless it’s for their health and safety”. When I was growing up, we were offered bribes. She has a weird way of getting what she wants out of you. NTA"
cokmwy,Lmfao. Y’all are something else. ESH. For getting mad over a game and seeking revenge on each other.
coknsy,[deleted]
cokp6k,">I haven't deleted the picture and won't unless my wife or her friend asks me to.

That's what's important. It's up to the people in the pic, not the bf. He needs to sort out his feelings with his gf, not with you. NTA"
cokspq,"NTA
He crossed a line singling out someone. If he can't take it, then don't dish it out. Perfect response btw!!!"
cokwyb,"NTA - Great idea! I live in a a Muslim country myself and we don't have this, si definitely a good idea! 

Your parents would definitely be TA's for bit appreciating what their daughter is trying to do."
cokxq3,"NTA - frankly, it’s really considerate of you to leave a space for her because of the circumstance. If I were the niece, and you had my name tattooed on you the first time we met, I would think that was super weird."

1. I’m actually surprised that they had the “no gift” thing in her contract. It’s common for domestic staff of wealthy people to get flights, tips, etc. It’s one of the normal perks of these sort of jobs. They don’t pay very well at all. 

2. It’s definitely not unusual to leave sims of money to servants (this is an actual legal term) in wills. She’s his near constant companion. No one else is around and she keeps him company, safe, and healthy. 

3. If you are concerned about how MUCH he would leave her, then I actually suggest that you bring up the topic yourself. “I know you really appreciate how much she does for you, and I think next time one of us is out there, we should go to your lawyer to adjust your will to leave her a gift”. That way, you guys run the conversation and can have some control over what does happen. You can also give her something of value from the home that she likes, like a vase. Of course, nothing super meaningful to the family. Also discuss power of attorney since he’s getting so on in years. Talk about how someone would need to make sure bills are paid, and she gets paid, etc. 

4. The photos are a tad weird, but the kitchen is probably where she spends most of her time working. I don’t see it as too different from putting up photos in a cubicle. 

5. As for the bday card. Don’t read too much into it. I doubt there’s anything romantic happening. She cares for him and has for a decade. That’s a long time to be with a person day in an day out. NOT developing affection for him would actually be odd imo. 

I would not make a move against her until something egregious happens. It will break the old mans heart. He clearly cares for her too. It would just create a bad situation."

How do you even know for certain he is the father, if your sister hasn't told anyone? You say he's oblivious to her existence, but you probably don't know this for certain. There's a lot here that you might not know about, so I wouldn't do anything without speaking to your sister first.

You made your position clear, your mother either ignored you or didn't understand. Either way it makes sense that you're upset.

That being said, Mac books run a Unix OS, and the majority of scientists I work with (we are linux people at heart, and run our software on it) still use Mac books. Either software is okay to run locally, or they ssh into departmental machines, so I'm not certain you are as doomed with a Mac book as you think. Alternatively (and this isn't a super nice idea) for anything that *has* to be on a linux distribution you could use a virtual box.

I also know a couple of people who were able to set up their Mac books to dual boot with Linux, but that was a bit trial and error for one of them.

Telling you about it literally does nothing (no offense) as you're not going to magically come home and solve the problem.  All it does is just fuck you up mentally.  

I went ahead and read the rest of the post but I feel like my advice stays true.  You're justified in cutting her out.  If she won't help you with your problems, what obligation do you have to help her?  Tell her that you have pee and that you'll call her back and just proceed to mute her number."

You have a four year old, alone time doesn’t exist. Also she’s 8 months pregnant and still working, good for her. Geez dude stay home with your family."
cot3pk,"I’m pretty sure they can’t force you to tip, and the fact that they tried to manipulate you into giving more money is ridiculous, pretty sure that might even be illegal. Not only that, but if someone isn’t doing their job, they don’t deserve the money anyways. NTA."
cot4ro,"NTA- she is being immature and selfish! I can’t believe she is holding your inability to drive over your head like that. A true friend would tell you ahead of time about her plans, or swing by and drop you off at home before her next stop. I would try and distance myself from this friend if you see other signs she doesn’t care about what you want/need"
cot9xp,"YTA. You made a rule, and she made a point to clean up after herself because of that rule. Then you punished her for following the rule."
cotbcu,"NTA

I can’t believe your parents were trying to convince you *not* to work. How else will you ever become an independent adult who can take care of their own needs? Wtf.

It’s your paycheck that you earned and you can spend it however you want to. It’s their choice if they don’t want to financially support you because you’re an adult and you can earn an income, but their reasoning for cutting you off seems suspicious, almost like they’re mad that you won’t be dependent on them forever and cutting you off abruptly is a knee-jerk reaction if they hadn’t brought up doing so before. Still confused on whether they want you to work or not.

Their behavior afterwards is shitty too. What is turning you against the other parent supposed to solve? The gift money was a birthday gift, so I don’t think it was wrong to treat your friends with it if that’s how you chose to use the gift. Gifts don’t come with strings attached.

My advice to you is to just focus on saving up for a while after this, so that they eventually won’t have any control left over your life or finances and you won’t have to worry about getting the rug pulled from under you."
cotccx,[deleted]
coth4u,"NTA- You will not be the asshole for taking a much needed break. You should explain to your families that they have many future holidays with you that you might visit for, but for this holiday the two of you want to be with each other. You can probably phrase it in such a way that they will be embarrassed to question you too much."
cothx9,"I wouldn’t say you’d be an asshole, but you’ll probably get talked about in their circle, which might be worse :(  double standards are real"
cotqi8,"YTA. Phones are expensive devices and it’s your job to 1. Have a protective case on it. 2. Watch your device to prevent accidents. 3. Have insurance on your device to pay for accidents that are bound to happen. 

There’s a reason sales people strongly suggest you buy a case at the point of purchase and if you had done that the phone likely wouldn’t be broken. Chalk this up to a lesson learned the hard way and pay the extra $50 for a case once you get your screen fixed."
cotzj7,"ESH. It sucks that you weren’t included and they didn’t wait for you, but it’s just a game. Sounds like if you’re always online and they don’t invite you they don’t want to play with you. And it sounds like you overreacted a bit with the whole asking constantly. Just take a breath and relax and find some other people to play with that will include you"
cou1nx,NTA. You dodged a bullet. Better to have nothing to do with someone who handles situations the way he did.
cou1tu,NTA. He should have spoken to you before selling/pairing down the combined deck and at least asked if you wanted your cards back. He's being TA especially for not even giving you half of what he got for selling them.
cou7wr,"NTA, they trespassed and were obnoxious. If it's constant loud music late at night during the week that doesn't get turned down when you ask, I think calling the police is reasonable (I don't think it'll change much though). If it's not late at night or if they turn it down when you ask, you would be unreasonable. It sucks and I get that but for now it doesn't sound like you have much option but to put up with it."
couc82,"You’re not the arse for using it, but not getting out ASAP is borderline arsehole behaviour."
couf0r,"ESH, they are completely TA, but that doesn't mean that you will not be one for wishing death to someone, it doesn't justify it"
cougl8,"NTA because friendships require reciprocity were all parties make a similar effort to be available to each other regardless of when it's important to them individually. It seems that this firend is only interested in things that matter to them, and not so much in being there in support of your needs when they do not matter to her."
couhgj,"NTA, your roomie is weird and maybe next time you should invite a homeless guy and offer him your bed to sleep. Jokes apart, the guy should have had some sense to ask you before he just slept in the bed. Manners and Courtesy can take people a long way."
couhsn,"NAH.

I don’t think either of you are assholes. You’re both still figuring out how to live together.

Perhaps you could establish some ground rules. Like,  you can talk loudly or whatever until 10-11pm and then be mindful after that in case people are sleeping (unless of course it’s already been agreed that there’s going to be a party).

The only thing that happened that I think was slightly out of order was that he was being aggressive and directing his annoyance towards your guest. That’s just rude."
couhtp,"NTA, your parents are over reacting a lot, prove yourself worthy getting at time for work every day.
And its YOUR life, you can do what you want, you are an adult"
coujdc,"NTA, kids and mother are. I always find it really inconsiderate when people watch things out loud, like either bring earphones or do something else y’know?"
couors,NTA. He really shouldve planned ahead. Someone should show him that he wont always have people around to rescue him from whatever mess he got himself into. He needs to grow up.
couoxt,[deleted]
couq9m,"I’d say ESH.

I truly believe that you did a very nice thing for your nephews out of kindness. However, I think you should have cleared it with your brother before purchasing such a valuable gift. He may be trying to teach the kids a lesson in the value of working hard for their money, or he may feel intimidated by your wealth since he is the elder brother. Or maybe he feels like it’s his job as a dad to provide that for his kids and you stole his thunder.

I think there should have been more communication and if you felt the need to repay the kindness he showed you, you guys should have had a conversation about that first."
couqzk,YTA. Anyone who cannot put his or her name to his or her work needs to find a different job.
cousa5,"NTA. While the general rule is not to parent other people's kids, an air traffic control tower is no place for kids."
cov1gi,[deleted]
cov6l0,"NTA. It's fine to complain, she broke your stuff. Doesn't sound like an accident but more like negligence too. How old was the knife though? Depending on the age, not sure that calling for a full reimbursement is fair though"
cov7jx,"NTA but you should know that whatever you say to one person will usually be shared with a SO. The boyfriend is an AH though because the rule of thumb is that if you didn’t hear it from the source, you don’t mention it at all."
cov871,"YTA.   It wasn’t bad enough that you would return if the opportunity arises, but yet you feel it necessary to leave a bad review?   That seems a bit disingenuous to me."
covbo1,NTA. Whatsoever.
covc0w,"NTA.

He's trying to overcome the prejudice and homophobia his family taught him. I respect him for that and completely understand this is difficult. The fact that he realized those beliefs were wrong and hurtful, and that he's trying to change his mindset is amazing. You're a good friend for supporting him."
covcj2,"NTA - they shouldnt take advantage of you, they seemed to only ask you to take the shifts so they can enjoy themselves when they should also think about your enjoyment and if you had any actual plans. It's a give and take not a take and take.

My partner and I are like that too but I give my manager and work mates 2 weeks notice so they can sort something out. Tell them straight up bud, they need to know."
covevb,"ESH.  Learn how to drop a subject.  He told you he wasn’t interested and why, there’s no need to keep badgering him about it just because you think it’s a good idea for his project.  He also shouldn’t have blown up about it, obviously.  I hardly think the guy has never gotten angry in his life so his wife is an AH for acting like you broke him.  Your wife seems in the clear."
covjt8,"YTA 

You don’t own names and no name is as unique as you think. 

That’s pretty much the start and end of it.   Yeah it’s in poor taste but it’s also not that big a deal.   People get weirdly fixated on what they name kids. 


I’m also going to point out that you are kinda a double asshole because you aren’t currently in the process of having kids.    You can never claim or call dibs on a name but you DEFINITELY can’t when you don’t even have a kid on the way"
covojf,"ESH.

Asshole thing to do, but completely justified. Guy's a prick."
covp12,NTA. She sounds like she doesn’t get it and will push for something you don’t want. She also sounds very full of herself if she thinks she can change you because she’s “pretty perfect.” Do not give her your real name.
covq7k,"NTA, what comes next? Wearing sunglasses in summer? You monster!"
covr13,"Laughing in European... How is a person with ptsd allowed a Gun? NTA, you did the right thing"
covs62,"NTA at *all*. There’s so much wrong with this I don’t know where to start. Your mother needs to take more account of your feelings and to be honest it doesn’t seem like she has much time for you.

I’m so sorry you’re in this situation OP and I hope you can spend some more time with your dog."
covstx,NAH. You didn't feel safe driving and your Mum was distraught because her brother was dying and she needed a charger to get in contact with people.
covtit,"NTA. 

You asked the parent, and that's the only person who's judgement matters."
covwu4,"NTA, this guy seems like a creep who pretends to be gay so he can pressure women into sleeping with him by making them feel like they're ""turning a gay man straight"". *Super* predatory behavior from him."
covx6z,"NTA. doesn’t matter that it’s a religious thing, that’s annoying"
covx9y,NAH your dad is a conservative dude. He just wants what he thinks is best for you. You don’t share his views on premarital sex so you don’t care. I would say just don’t flaunt that you are doing it and hope for the best.
covzkq,I have literally never heard of anyone saying sharing toothpaste is bad.
cow0fq,"NTA - But instead of asking for compensation you should have just said no, you don't have time. You're not their errand boy/girl. You should be annoyed with your roommate's coworker, not the other way around, for expecting you to just do whatever they want."
cow3td,"NTA

You should never have let him back in your home.

Stop letting other people convince you that you should take care of other who mistreat you.  Move on with living an amazing life."
cow3ui,NTA - No need for Mark to get crushed when you know her pattern.
cow4iu,"NTA. You're living your life, and it sounds like you're in a good place. Keep doing what makes you happy!"
cowcct,"NTA. not only is that unhygienic and inconsiderate of your shared space, the way he handled his response was disrespectful"
cowczz,"NTA

Everytime they are loud, record it to have prove.

But also go to their door and press the bell. Press it like ding ...... ding ...... ding ...... ding ..... and so on until they are annoyed as fuck an open the door. And just say ""hey I heard loud noises is everyrhing ok?"" Play the dumb."
cowfbt,"NTA 

She most likely lashed out because she was embarrassed. Still makes her the asshole though. You aren't an asshole for being grossed out and now she knows that you don't like kissing her after that. I would just forget about it."
cowm63,NTA I've never bought an anniversary present for another couple that's just weird.
cowz0b,"ESH. Everyone in this story is so petty and dramatic, it's a wonder any of you still talk at all."
cox1f3,"NAH. My question is, is he willing to do the same for you? You both need a break from being parents to a toddler sometime.. if he goes on this trip, is there a way you could plan a girls' trip in the near future?"
cox5r9,"NTA but this story makes me uncomfortable just for the fact that your dad had to unlock your door to get in. I’d probably be mad too.

EDIT: You also shouldn’t have to justify being naked while you sleep. Plenty of people do it. And you locked your door. It’s your private space."

coxctg,NTA it seems obvious to me from your explanation that she’s not looking for your company but what you can bring to the table. It’s so weird to me that’s you’d be invited to the shower but not the wedding. I’d send a response saying I’m unable to attend and move along with my life. Attending this shower wouldn’t even be an option for me
coxe9b,"NTA - this trip was planned with a friend long before your relationship. I would see it as a major dick move since a oversea trip require planning, saving and taking time off work. Stuff that you already set in motion. 

And Paris would still be there for Any future romantic endavours right?"
coxgeh,"NTA. BUT you are treading on Thin ice here. Your brother is your parents responsibility, not yours. I think you did the right thing to voice your concerns, But its up to your parents to go thru with them. 

I hated when my siblings tried to parent me, and I’ve learn the hard way that its a good way to ruin a good sibling relationship."
coxhyb,"NAH (except for UPS)- You want your money back for an item you didn’t receive which is understandable. He doesn’t want to refund you because from his end it looks like you’ve received the package, which is also understandable. Although you should definitely fight UPS more on this. If they know it was their mistake they should front cost. Im not sure on how likely they would pay up though. 
Anyway I wouldnt blame you for asking for a charge back."
coxjfx,NTA you barely know this lass.
coxkjb,"NTA 

The cheating clause being rejected makes me think she is too spoiled to be a wife"
coxlle,NTA. If he came over uninvited and didn’t say he had food allergies that is not your problem. He knows he has them so it’s on him to ask what’s in the food.
coxo78,"NAH

But honestly, if you value her as a friend, would it kill you to listen to the album a couple times through?  Hell, for my friends, I'd probably even learn a couple of the songs I liked better just to be able to play with them sometimes."
coxpm8,"FFS

Are there any real posts here today?

Yes, of course YTA.

Likely every single day of your life.  She is absolutely correct, you are an interfering Mother in law."
coxrzm,NTA. Your girlfriend is acting completely immature.
coxtza,"> I didn’t think my GF would remember, but she does.

Oh honey, you didn't think someone would remember you buying a $7,000 bracelet?   YTA just for that level of delusion.

You didn't need to replicate that level of gift for your new girlfriend, but I can see that she'd be hurt for not putting a lot of thought into what you did buy her.  And honestly you probably should have talked to her at some point about the bracelet since she was with you when you bought it."
coxyn9,[deleted]
coy10a,"NTA. That's a pretty shitty attitude from your friends and I feel it's quite obvious that you're expected to at least clean up the big mess you make at someone else's house. This is just ridiculous:

>Well, it’s not my house so why would I help?

Because ***manners***. You are supposed to be a mature and decent human being. Not leave your mess behind for your ""friend"" to clean up. That's not how friends act."
coy12y,"NAH. I feel like you did the responsible thing by telling them because I don't know your guys' ages, but it seems you're still in your teens and this may very well be something that needs to be treated by a professional. Much better this way than her hurting herself. She'll probably get to go to dance later on again."
coy134,"YTA- NOT for saying ur muggles but for saying its real in the first place

Edit: everyone keeps bringing up santa.
As i already said in another comment here is the difference 

“Yah but here is the difference. When saying santa is real they then CAN follow up by faking presents  when easter bunny they can fake it by hiding eggs.
There IS NOT a way to fake the harry potter stuff except to say what he did which is that they are muggles”"
coy3oo,"NTA - your brother has no right to judge you like that. If people who are also fallible and have their own regrets and secrets are judgmental toward toward me and mine, we will not get along."

But you did tell him you were getting a dog? So why are they calling you names saying you didn't? They're idiots."
coylwd,"NTA 

I think your mom should respect your privacy enough to not look through your phone and read entire conversations with friends. Plus, she saw that you're trans, outted you, and belittled your identity. 

Obviously, you shouldn’t have looked through her phone and should’ve spoken to her directly. but you’re 15, and she’s much older than you. I think in this situation, she should’ve been more mature and asked her own son about what’s going on."
coyq5a,YTA you made her feel patronized like she wasn’t an equal friend as the guys
coyrab,"NAH. I don’t think either of you were assholes. I think it was a honest miscommunication. If you’re hurt by what your dad said, talk to him about it. If he’s offended you kept asking for money, he needs to talk to you"
coyrg8,"NTA. I’m sorry this happened to you and it’s great that your parents understand. Grandparents being set in their ways isn’t an excuse to make you feel like crap. You tried to do a nice, bonding thing with your grandpa and it backfired. It should be able to be smoothed over eventually (if that’s the only thing and there isn’t bigger problems with your parents and grandpa you don’t know about), but either way stubborn grandpa may take a while to get over it. You really put in a good effort though."
coyvk8,"ok this sucks but yes, YTA. it is not fair to expect your partner to wait indefinite weeks for you to pull your weight around the house. your depression is real and valid and i KNOW it takes a long time to get treatment sometimes, but none of that makes this fair to your partner. if you want compassion you need to sit down with him and explain what you know you need and ask him to help you plan for contributing during these phases. you are in denial about how bad this actually is and how long it will continue. please address this with him and good luck."
coz0s6,NTA you need to make a living. I think you should talk to him though and maybe fill him in on what’s going on so he can also understand why and not hold it against you. And sending the card is another aspect I think that makes you NTA because you had already RSVP’d yes.
coz1mw,YTA How is any of this your roomates problem?
coz1yj,"NTA - You’re helping her out and she has completely shat all over that l, you need to either be repair or she gets out that’s disgusting."
coz70v,"Eh borderline ESH. Bit crass with the response, but she definitely solicited it by being rude. Funny she could dish it out but gets upset as soon as she takes any heat."
coz7m8,NTA. and you might be being scammed.
coz9s4,YTA if you leave it outside. Nothing wrong with gathering them inside and telling your roommate later on what she did. Paint supplies are expensive AF. Don’t make him have to buy more or new ones.
cozahv,"ESH, but you suck least of all. They should have gotten their shit sorted long before it reached you.

And D should have played better D by wrapping his D. And because of this, he gets a D. Or, F, rather."
cozat3,NTA. It’s kinda weird but not racist.
cozcj2,NTA but your dad has a good point. Sometimes these groups will all get up and start beating the person who was offended. Don't give them an excuse to get violent.
cozdej,"NTA, but she’s got a point and if you can put that much away for a couple of years, you’ll be far ahead of most people. Maybe you can negotiate with her and go with 400 into savings."
cozegw,NTA. You've given her many chances.

cozrpl,"This sounds like the worst bus ride in the history of time.

You had what I will assume is a pretentious opinion.  Something like ""Oh my god, I can't understand why \*anyone\* would like this commercial and repetitive tripe.  My ears are \*literally\* bleeding from being subjected to such horrific screeching.""  Or something similar.

And your friends got tired of you being a music hipster, and said ""Yeah, your favorite album sucks.""  

And then you both just sat there going ""Why?"" ""Because."" ""Why?"" ""Because."" ""No, I truly wish to engage with you so that I can express to you my extremely important and elevated opinions on music."" ""No.  It sucks."" ""Why?"" ""Because.""

I may be overlaying, but I don't think so.

ESH."
cozuf2,"YTA - your friend isn't responsible for your displeasure with the hair. 

If you wanted it done a specific way, you should have gone to a professional.  Instead you decided to rely on someone who presumably does not do this for a living, and are unhappy with the results.  

Hopefully you learned a lesson."
cozxfz,"NTA

She can't control how you feel and, speaking from experience, what you feel is super common. I am closer to my friends than 90% of my family l."
cozy6a,"NTA - this is part of what i hate about weddings.  People get wound up in the minutia and forget it's supposed to be a celebration amongst friends and family.  if they really wanted her to be there, they could easily make it happen.   Alas people are so wound up in the ceremony and the goofy rituals, that common sense flies out the window."
cozyuj,NTA.  He's being enormously childish.  Hopefully someone else was able to be your DD so you could enjoy yourself.

cp029j,"Say nothing.  Don’t ask don’t tell us still an issue, plus it’s up to him when he chooses to reveal that.  Depending on his personality you could upset him by taking his choice to inform you away or by stealing his ‘revelation’.

Also it may have been an attempt to save face- who knows.

Make sure he knows he is loved and accepted in what ever subtle way you can! See what happens"
cp031o,"NAH, but you're never going to be 100% comfortable with your finances when it comes to a kid. There will always be one more thing. If you don't want a kid, then say that. Otherwise, IMO, you're just making up excuses."

cp0iy4,NTA you should come to work and feel safe.
cp0n3h,"NAH. He can still have a relationship with his ex's parents with whom he lived for a time, but should respect your desires not to.

By the way: at least in US English, 'foster' means something different than exchange program host family, do you may get some confused responses."
cp0n8b,"NAH, but don't. Mind your business.  Don't take sides on your parents' conflicting styles and just be there for your sister. Why does a 9 year old need homework in the summer anyway..."
cp0ny1,"NAH. She's not TA for wanting to sleep (and being sound sensitive), especially late at night, and you're not TA for wanting to stream occasionally."
cp0p9g,NAH its rude and it sounds like theyre pretty old fashioned. But they dont have to inlcude someone who is just a gf and not married.
cp0pa5,Yes YTA if you contact the company about this. From your title I thought he possibly sent you sexually forward texts or was trying to meet you outside of the professional service you needed.
cp0q5f,"NTA. Holy shit, OP. Your family is going on a family vacation and you're not invited? Your step mother seems to be an ass. Tell me, why are your step siblings allowed both a mother and a father while you are only allowed a father? It doesn't make sense.

I say, search for her. Definitely. But make sure not to expect too much as you could get disappointed. The only borderline assholeish thing would be to snoop in your dad's room, but given the circumstances, I think you have the right to.

And on a personal note, I too, on my own, reached out to my biological father around your age when he had been gone since I was 2. And flash forward to now (I'm 23): he is now the family member I consider closest to me. I am so grateful and glad I reached out to him, and he explained he was so shocked and happy when he got that call that he nearly drove his truck into a ditch. Pretty sure your mother, too, might be waiting for your call."

However, there was no reason for that woman to be rude to you. This is one of those things people just roll their eyes at and ignore, not make a big stink about."

cp16q8,"ESH. 

You should just have been honest at the time and said, ""No kisses today, but we'll do two next time!"" or something like that. 

No one wants their kids kissing someone's purse. There have been studies that show that purses are filthy because they pick up all kinds of germs from shopping carts, bus seats, toilet stall hooks, you name it. Plus it just seems demeaning. 

On the other hand, she should have stopped her kid from kissing someone when they were sick, she should have told you if the purse thing bothered her, and she shouldn't have held a grudge this long.  She was irresponsible and now she's being immature.

If I were tipping the scales, I'd say she sucks more than you."
cp1afn,"NTA.  It's reasonable to protect yourself and your kids by not relying on someone who's been unreliable in the past.  Since it sounds like he's trying to reach out, spend some time with him while you're there and see how it goes.  But sleeping elsewhere ensures no unexpected lack of shelter for the night, and gives all of you a break from each other.

If you want to be diplomatic, tell him it's easier on the kids to stay at the other place the whole other time, but you appreciate the invitation and may take him up on it next time"
cp1aix,"It sounds like your family picks at your gf and makes a bunch of snide comments that could be classified as microaggressions. Ever hear of death   by 1000 cuts? Every one of those comments is another cut. Can't say I blame her for not wanting to spend time with them. You need to be sticking up for her when these things happen.

But her general sulkiness and hair trigger at your birthday was over the top. She needs to be able to manage her emotions better.

ESH."
cp1aq8,"NAH but it’s a really tough decision. The fact that you’re even asking the question shows you care for her and that just makes you a good Brother.

*And your excuse is 'I might have spaced out and thought she was going to take your children to the party?' C'mon...


*You just didn't communicate your unilateral **decision** to anyone, and you did **only** what was best for yourself.



First and foremost you're the father of the children you decided to bring to this world, so you should assume this responsibility (they're children, it's not ""IF they need me they'll call me).



Second,you need to address the problem of you sleep deprivation and work hours in an **adult manner**, dialoguing and finding a solution WITH your SO. 


Of course everyone needs to sleep to be able to parent and to work. It's a matter of which arrangement is better for everybody in your family, that's done through open dialogue - every time it's needed.


You and your SO could maybe decide to hire a babysitter for some situations. There are other alternatives beyond just irresponsibly doing whatever you want.

Alcoholism is a very serious health problem and needs to be addressed - but **only he can decide to do it**.


Needing to drink alcohol to be able to relax is a rationalization for the addiction.


Besides, he's snapping at you over your (right) attitude of bringing up the problem.

*Pre edit comments kept for posterity*:

>when he doesn't want to?

See that right there? That's the be all and end all of this topic. He doesn't want you to help. That's the only thing you need to know. 

He's not drowning in the ocean, he's not succumbing to drug addiction, he's not losing all of his money at casinos. Those are some of the only situations where it **might** be okay to try to help someone even if they don't want it.

Offer him support. Let him know you're there to help if and when he wants it. It's admirable that you *want* to help.

But in just about every situation when someone literally tells you to stop helping, you are the asshole if you keep trying to ""help."""

cpbd8m,"YTA.

Aside from the sheer 1800s vibe I'm getting from you (how does not drinking mean you're a morally good person? same re: not partying or being a virgin), you're reducing people to a checklist.

You know nothing about the blind date you're friend is trying to set you up with - you have the checklist answers (age, virginity, current job) but nothing else. You're judging her based on cold facts, but people aren't like that - is she working so she can go to school w/o debt? Is she actually earning more than you will be post-university? What's her favourite food, or opinion on IDK current politics?

> What makes this worse is that recently I was rejected by a girl who was everything I ever wanted, and no one harped her into lowering her standards or that she should date me cause ""I am a 'good person'""

Bluntly, because the girl you want isn't a person, she's a checklist - you want a virgin who doesn't drink and goes to school, but here's a cold reality. Women are more than just that. They're humans with actual thoughts and feelings and, you know, a personality. The way you describe your perfect woman, it feels like anyone who fits that checklist will do. Me? I want to wanted for the person I am, not just because I'm a virgin who goes to school and doesn't drink. Like, what do you actually know about the girl who rejected you? Did you bother to learn anything about her? Doesn't sound like it.

It's one thing to reject a person if you don't find them attractive or feel a connection with them - or even if you feel they don't see as an individual. It's another to say 'she's not a virgin and isn't in law school, so she's beneath me and I could never date her.'

That said, please don't change your mind based on this - that poor girl deserves far better than you.

Oh, and as an aside - you've given me no proof that you're a good person, and all the proof that you're a judgemental dick from the middle ages. So I'd revise that last line.

YTA.

**EDIT:** Since there are a couple of comments re: how OP's allowed to have preferences, I thought I'd address them all here.

Yes, he's allowed to have preferences. And I'm not saying he has to (or should!) date the girl in question. But he's TA for the way he's acting and treating women.

First off, the mechanic thing. It's one thing to say 'I want someone with ambition.' It's another to say 'she's a mechanic so she's beneath me.' Like I said, he knows nothing about her - is she working so she can afford school? Is her earning potential very high based on the cars she services? I'd imagine doing something like specialising in vintage restorations would have high earning potential. Is her industry highly competitive? He knows nothing, just 'she a tradie so she's lesser than.'

The virginity thing isn't about something like same religious values, to him her not being a virgin means she's not a good person. Same re: partying and drinking. 

He's judging her character based on facts that have nothing to do with it, and is offended that his friend is saying she's a good person, and that someone would think he'd deign to stoop that low as to date a non-virgin tradie /s

At the same time, he's offended he was turned down by his 'dream woman' - who he again knows nothing about save a checklist of attributes. It may surprise people, but women like to treated like humans - saying 'I want to sate you because you're a virgin who doesn't party and is a lawyer' isn't exactly a draw. And I promise you, she knew he was looking at her like an object - it's not that difficult to figure out. So no, no one is telling her 'he's a good person,' because she has valid reasons for turning him down. 

Him? He's just acting holier than thou and expecting the world to grovel at his feet."
cpbe1l,"You say that you cannot tell them about your problems because yours arent as bad as theirs.  Heres the thing, you have a supportive group that  is willing to help out.  They dont know whats going on, but as you said ""you can always tell when something is wrong"".

Tell them whats up, they seem like good people, at least this way they will understand your uncaring behaviour.  They might have tips or support, even if you cant explain properly.

Are you TA? I think its more complex than that, you sound depressed and emotionally exhausted, these are feelings that can come about without any of the horrific conditions your friends may have.  They might have it worse than you, but really that doesn't matter. They want to help you, I suggest you let them.  Having a deeper understanding can help you move past just being the funny guy.

Sure but I think she's more upset that you tried to take her room so quickly after she was getting ready to leave and leaving for college is a really hard thing to do for most 18-year-olds."
cpgm76,"YTA. Your father wanted his children, ALL of his children, to receive equal parts of the inheritance.  You have no right to say otherwise.

Further, I would say it sounds like you’re judging step-bro far more harshly than is fair. You clearly have a problem with step-bro “bumming” off your dad while furthering his education, but have no issue with your dropout older bro doing the same thing. So he doesn’t have a relationship with you and smokes weed? Who cares? Neither of those things should affect his inheritance.

Besides, he clearly doesn’t smoke as much as you claim, seeing as he’s managed to earn one masters degree already and is working on a second. As someone in grad school now, I can tell you he isn’t “smoking weed 24/7” and doing that."
cpgm85,"NAH.

My great aunt is a lot like your husband. She has worked for over 60 years and built herself a nice nest egg. She enjoys treating us to dinner and will NOT allow anybody else to buy the meals. She'll actually get upset if you sneak around and try to catch a waiter, like your husband does.

From the receiving end, I'll tell you that it's very bitter sweet. It's nice to get a free meal, but it sucks not being able to give that back. I would like to buy her a meal every once in awhile, even if it doesn't make us even.
Maybe your husband is missing the other party's perspective."
cpgmv1,"YTA. It's fine for you to not agree with your friend's decision but once she has made that decision, if you want to continue to be her friend, you can't keep throwing her decisions in her face. When her kid is five years old, or ten, or fifteen, are you going to keep telling her she shouldn't have had it? It's her life. You can't live it for her."
cpgo6o,NTA you should limit your time with people who mistreat you. It teaches them to behave better towards you and preserves your mental health and relationships.
cpgp6g,NTA. He actually stalked and harassed your girlfriend until she got fired. Call his mom and maybe even get a restraining order. His behavior freaks me out.
cpgpam,"NTA, you’re a good person OP. Don’t let this discourage you from helping in the future. You gave her good directions and she ignored them, the repercussions are on her."
cpgqh2,"NTA. I live with my parents, and I'd never dream of not contributing. $200 a month for rent and $60 for his phone bill is an absolute steal.

You don't have to financially support your employed adult children. You're not asking him for money for yourself, you're asking him to be responsible and cover a mere fraction of his own costs.

My only criticism here is that you've enabled him. Stop driving him to work."
cpgqhs,"ESH.

You should uh... be kinda wary of a teenager actively taking steps to pursue older men. Thankfully the frat guys weren't creeps but this could've went *hella* sideways if you just so happened to come home and A.J. was gone. However you don't necessarily need to punish her so much as just give her an explanation.

Also your BIL is a turd for the way he reacted. That being said, he's kinda justified in being freaked out about his nice going to talk to older people like that."
cpgqpt,"NTA, Spotify has a family option and y'all can split the cost of the membership if you'd like.  it's your money to do with as you please."
cpgse6,"NTA. If your SIL has a problem with the way your relationship is going, she should talk to you about it instead of sending messages through your brother, and you're all grown-ass adults who shouldn't get their feelings hurt this easily about tiny slights on social media. This is juvenile behavior on her part, and your brother is actively supporting it. I don't know how they think blowing of family dinner on a rare visit is going to make you closer.

You may need to be the bigger person to get through this, and that's probably the wisest choice. But you're definitely on the high ground right now."
cpgsng,"NTA. His rules are way too rigid. Those are definitely something to aim for, but seriously cancelling vacations if you don't meet them?"
cpgwfh,"NTA.

That’s your personal history. If it’s not relevant or you just don’t want to share it, you don’t have to, especially since it doesn’t affect your relationship.

My fiancé has depression from traumatic events in her past, and I’m not going to pry. Why? Because I’m an adult and know that 1) she’s happy being with me and 2) that’s her personal information to share when she sees fit.

Everyone else seems to be overreacting to this a lot. Your significant other shouldn’t be throwing a mini tantrum like this.

Edit: I shared this with her and she said that your significant other is a dick and everyone else is being an asshole to you. (She’s a blunt person)"
cpgwy5,"NTA
I think it's a beautiful way to remember your friend. Sam needs some help though, that's not how a healthy adult should react."

This one is interesting. I don't think you're the asshole if you keep this to yourself. The backlash and drama this could create might be harsh. 

Keep it to yourself with the realization that you're not the first and won't be the last person this pastor will hit on."
cph2zc,"NTA- I work in IT, 10 years experience from desktop support to server/network administration. Regardless of him being able to fix the issue or not, loosing data is absolutely unacceptable, and should be avoided at any availability to do so. Sure, things do corrupt and files can fail to open and cannot be restored. But in this case he should have backed up your profile data before going after finding a solution (especially with a profile rebuild).

He failed at his basic job parameters and it cost you your files/work.

Edit:

It may be worth trying to search for them yourself... search for a file name you know of within the C: drive, or check within C:\Users folder and see if the files are within a sub-user folder."
cph354,"NTA - do it, do it, do it!"
cph6gx,"Definitely NTA, the child is"

You don’t have a responsibility to **warn** people. However I do think you have a responsibility to be honest if anyone asks about their housemates. There really is no other party in this regard to call the asshole so (since the housemates aren’t part of this issue)."
cphcrn,NTA. Parents who want their kids to pay them back for raising them shouldn't have kids.
cphg75,"NAH, hear me out.

You’re not an asshole for not wanting to buy your friends art. And no one else sucks. I make music and I don’t expect my friends to enjoy or buy my music. But you should tell your friend you’re not interested in his artwork, that it’s nothing personal against him, just your taste."
cphgev,"NTA, as long as you phrase it politely. Having the expectation to not step in dogshit while working on their yard isn't unreasonable."
cphh9s,"YWBTA - it already is an opt-in thing that those who are interested in participate in. You are one of the people who choose not to participate. 

If it bothers you that much why not suggest getting an actual cake, or donuts or something with the money instead? Or when it's *your birthday* offer to bring in a cake yourself and start a new tradition that way.

If you aren't offering to do something positive and constructive, then why take something away from people who actually enjoy it? It's not hurting you any."
cphlld,"YTA your sister is right, she is a person and you're treating her like the faceless ""help."""

cphnbn,"NTA because at the end of the day it's your business what objects you have on your property, your neighbor wasn't being very polite by yelling stuff at you, and that tree is not yours that you are obligated to deal with.

Wow, that's a lot for a 14 y.o. to process and, gotta be honest, I'm glad you're alive to tell the tale. Human trafficking is no joke. Do you realize how risky that... sorry, sorry, just went into Old Lady Mom / True Crime Nerd modes. Anyway, any anger you feel at your sister is valid since you told her something in confidence and she betrayed that trust to, what seems like, the absolute last person she should have been blabbing to. 

So, \*hugs\* take care of yourself and I wish you the best and I hope your mom and sister can get right with you some day."
cpi160,"ESH: them for pushing her to keep it, her for doing drugs while pregnant, and you for thinking it's your place to tell her what to do when you've just said you have no relationship with her."

cpi9wy,YTA. You can't call dibs on a name if you're not even pregnant.

cpian3,"NTA

Unfortunately, it is so common for people not to break down the weights after they are finished with bench, that in situation like this your *only* option for knowing whether someone is using the bench is to wait around a minute or two.  You did exactly that, so nothing more can really be expected of you.

If the other guy didn't want the bench to get used while he was gone, he had two options:

(1) Limit the time he's gone.  Say you want to do some curls in between bench sets.  Then when you are ready to curl: walk over to the dumbbells, do a set, immediately walk back before resting.  Shouldn't take more than a minute or so.

(2) If he must be gone longer (maybe he needs to take a piss, and the bathroom is far away) leave a towel or water bottle or something to indicate that someone is actually still using the bench. (of course, if you are gone too long, the bottle/towel can't save your spot forever, but it's a sign that you haven't simply neglected to break down the weights).

\---

Also, feel like the gym probably deserves some blame too.  Every single gym i've been to, bench stations are *always* the most underprovided thing.  Just give the people what they want!"
cpibgb,NTA. Pretty insulting when someone puts off paying you back and then goes off and publicly displays themselves spending money needlessly.
cpidui,NTA and please flip it around on your mother because why she making you go when she herself is not going...
cpif10,"NAH. It's your ring and you have reasons to keep it. But I would so strongly suggest you pass this ring on. The only reason this ring has *meaning* to you is that it WAS passed on. Like you said, ~~when you decided to adopt your stepdaughter~~, she ~~became~~ is your daughter in all but name. Your daughter obviously thinks highly of you ~~and there's no indication from your post that your doubts of her sincerity are well-founded~~."

cpikjg,"NTA - You were uninvited, it’s as simple as that. Planning to fly out last minute for a wedding you heard you were re-invited to through the grapevine is not ideal. It sounds like your family members don’t know the full story, I’m not sure how they could take her side if they knew you a) were uninvited, b) weren’t re-invited until last minute."
cpio4x,Controversial NAH just because your roommate clearly isn't coping well. This isn't malicious; this is an inability to process a difficult emotion.
cpiqvg,"NTA. Incompatible sex drives have sunk many a marriage. You need to talk it over with your wife.

I also don't consider masturbation cheating. If your wife isn't willing to help you with your sex driver, the alternative to jerking the chicken is to have other women do it for you, and I'm sure she'd be even more upset about that."

Your sister is not the only parent to the baby, and it's kinda rude to assume that her husband, the freaking father of the baby, is not capable of taking care of the baby's needs.

Babies cry for numerous reasons (I had colics and was an absolute nightmare for my parents during my first year of life), and it's just... Well, they're humans, that's what humanity is like. It might be strange and very inconvenient for adult society, but if the parents are not mistreating the kid, you might just have to learn to deal with it."

It is not a scholarly argument or any sort of accurate account of the ancient myth.

As for calling you too skinny, that's her insecurity manifesting again - Unless you're doctor says that you've lost too much weight, she's probably more worried about herself than about you.

&#x200B;

I don't think she's doing it to be cruel, but I think that her frustration is misplaced. Instead of trying to lose her own weight, she is (whether consciously or not) trying to make you gain it back.

cpl1yf,"YTA for your judgmental and narrow-minded view of the world. 

First off, there are plenty of “good people” who are single and child-free well into their 30s+ these days. Many people are choosing to prioritize education/careers/personal growth before settling down and I think that’s commendable. Sure, your relatives may not be able to chime in with insights into the challenges of child rearing and marital bliss, but do you really think your single relatives couldn’t relate to topics about work and life? Or, do you think you played up the “married with kids” discussion to subtly remind them that they’ve chosen an “unstable” path? Have you tried to engage with them about *their* interests and what’s going on in their lives? 

Second, you say “there’s nothing wrong” with the paths your family members have chosen but you sound very condescending. It’s great that you were able to marry relatively young and maintain a happy and health marriage for a decade. Not everyone is mature or lucky enough to pick the right person when they’re young and there’s no reason to act like getting married in your early-to-mid-20s is a path to a stable life. I was married and divorced before 25 because I was blind to signs of abuse and I’m confident that additional maturity would’ve spared me from that disaster. 

Finally, living the party life doesn’t automatically mean you’re living a single life. Some of the hardest partying people I know have been in committed relationships for 10+ years. It’s not like being committed means you can’t still enjoy yourself."
cpl234,"NTA. 

and no you shouldn’t be prepared to deal with the consequences. Your husband should shield you from those circumstances. He needs to step up and protect you from his mother and her machinations."
cpl3y4,[deleted]
cpl6n1,"NAH if you drop it now. You said what you needed to say, now it's up to your aunt.

If you didn't have the medic experience I would have said you were TA, but it makes sense that you feel strongly about this."
cpl74f,"NTA- youre right she is sending mixed signals. This should be taken back to HR since he was already told to keep contact to work related things already. And again your right if he makes work awkward because she didnt accept the friend request that should also be taken to HR.  He clearly has boundary issues and shes kind of enabling it.
Your concern is complete valid and not at all controlling. You voice an opinion and gave good advice."
cplaf6,ESH. You're the justified ass but be the bigger person. Document his issues and use his actions against him to get rid of him rather than stooping to his level.
cplafm,"NTA

Ask them why they’re taking vacation days from their job. Is it because they need a break? Hmph. 

Everyone needs a break once in a while. I had class on a Friday Friday, graduated college on Saturday and I went to work on Sunday. I didn’t even have a full 24 hours break. I’m TIRED. I’ve been tired for the last year working this job. All I want is a break but I need the money. 

Don’t listen to them. Are you paying them rent of any kind or helping with bills? If you can afford to take the week off, do it. Depending on a work schedule and major, it may be a while before you see another truly free (no work, class, homework, internship, errands, etc) day again. 

My usual advice with sucky families is find a way to support yourself and move out."
cpld5m,"NTA you bought it, it's yours. Just let them know ahead of time so they're not stuck in the bathroom."
cplf8f,ESH if you don't try to communicate the problem first. You're not TA if you've tried to fix it and he still doesn't make an effort.
cplfno,NTA - Quitting on your first day is actually the best thing to do if you don't like the job.
cplgx4,"NTA

It seems like you guys were clearly in the process of making a decision TOGETHER and she went ahead and got what SHE wanted anyway, specifically while you were away so you couldn’t stop her. 

I would have done the same. If she wants help paying for a couch she can take that one back and choose one you BOTH like in both of your price range. 

You’re a COUPLE. Things should be done and decisions made TOGETHER. And that includes compromises like furniture. 

That being said, a couch is a fairly petty argument to have if this relationship is supposed to end in marriage."
cplhzl,"NTA. It sounds like you've tried 5 times and she's dead-set on not believing you.  It sounds like you've got a lot going on in your head without focusing on convincing her of your real situation.  Good luck to you; and just curious have you told the shrink about her, and what's going on in your current life.  Or do you only talk about what happened in your past?  It sounds like this is way over the AITA sub community pay grade."
cpliv8,Hotels do have regulars that travel often for business. I would say he was just being nice. But the front desk should not have said your room number out loud.
cplizg,"NTA. DO NOT GET ON THAT PLANE without return tickets in hand.

Edit: y'know, on second thought, don't get on that plane at all. ""Get sick"" the day before your flight. If you can't handle lying to your parents, stick your fingers down your throat, puke, and tell then honestly that you've thrown up and aren't feeling well. Something about this story gave me this sense of unsettled doom."
cplj7s,YTA - Id hate to have you as a neighbor. Imagine getting home from work ready to unwind before bed and you have to hear someone sing/yelling probably very badly.
cplj94,"YTA, and you knew you were behaving badly because you had to stop yourself from laughing in her face.  Save your jokes for when children are not involved."
cplpqm,"YTA - you're just creating a bunch of selfish asshats. Teach your son to be better than you are, and to set the good example he knows he should. 

and FFS listen to him next time. He's smarter than you and a much better human being."
cplr8m,">  I feel strongly about having open discussion and (nicely) calling out flawed thinking when I see it. 

This is why YTA.   People who believe in fixing other people's flawed thinking are called ""busybodies"".   If Ashley's family member has never responded, that means that they aren't interested in an open discussion, and you should back off.  You aren't changing anybody's mind; you're just shouting at a wall.   You don't know what Ashley's relative has said to Ashley off-Facebook, or how it's being taken by the rest of her family.

>  Or should I just pick my battles and keep my mouth shut?

You will be a much better friend and companion if you pick your battles.   Don't have arguments with people who've made it clear, by ignoring you, that they aren't interested."
cplrh8,"NTA - I'm thinking French-Canadians? If so, don't take it personally, most of them are assholes. I say this having married one!"
cplunz,"NTA - It's a date, I realise it has certain meanings, but the date can't be ignore for ever.

I would say pick it and hope for the best."
cpluow,"YTA. You're as much a member of the household as everyone else. So you're saying you never pour yourself a drink, maybe drag in a little dirt in on your shoes? Before you leave the house why don't you double check the garbage isn't overflowing and just throw it out. I'm not saying do their dishes but at least help tidy up.  I had an issue just like this with and old roommate that lead to moving out."
cplut6,"NTA but tell her first, don’t be shady"
cplwi9,YTA if your really no longer friends why should he let you use his stuff. at that point your just leeching off him.
cplwz0,[deleted]
cplx3t,"In that case YTA. The price of the goods was that you take their trash off of their hands, that’s why it was all or nothing. You broke that agreement and essentially stole from them."
cplxdv,NTA. You meant well here and you brought it up to him in a polite manner.
cplxwz,ESH. You have your boyfriend over too much. They didn’t sign up to live with him. They also should’ve replied and sound a little catty.
cplxye,NTA. You were abandoned and he slept at a different hotel and didn’t tell you he was leaving.
cplyhs,"NTA, your feelings are always valid and if you are uncomfortable then express it, which you did in the most polite way possible. Well handled OP"
cplypj,"NTA. Sounds like this is part of the reason why he hasnt seen his asshole mother in 8 years.

> My fiancé doesn’t deal with getting yelled at too well.

Quick tip, him offering to leave early was probly his way of saying ""I know shes being horrible but she can get worse, we should leave."" He likely asked in case you really did want to stay. Next time (if there has to be a next time), agree to leave."
cplz7u,"Nta - you offered to take the bike they just didn’t like the manner you suggested in which case it’s their problem. It’s not unreasonable to refuse
To risk damaging the interior of your car"
cpm13w,NTA runnnnn
cpm2cy,"Absolutely NTA. You're clearly acting with your sister's best interest in mind. And besides, even if your mother thinks she isn't ready for tampons, what happens if your sister starts unexpectedly and has access to nothing but a tampon. In those cases, it's much better to at least have some basic understanding of how to use them than none at all. If your mother can't understand that then it's reasonable to go behind her back."
cpma28,NTA - shame is the only thing that works with gross assholes like that
cpmhnw,NTA. I hate being invited to sleep places that are uncomfy to sleep more than anything. Anyone who gets mad about that is unreasonable.
cpmm0y,"YTA.  This is his sexuality, too.  Turning sex into only being about making a baby is very off putting.  I can understand you not wanting sex because your hormones are off, but he has the right to feel that he's being reduced to a sperm donor by this method.

And anyway, right now your hormones are off.  You'd be an asshole to *yourself* if you torpedoed your relationship because of something as temporary as a hormonal spike."
cpmmfm,"NTA but this is hilarious. You’re weird, but funny."
cpmn6p,"NTA. listen dude, I feel exactly what you do. My mom was an alcoholic who tore me down mentally and really fucked me up. Not all parents are parents of the year, some of em are total trash and that's okay, because they don't define you. If you want to cut them off, do it. Especially if she doesn't consider you her child (judging from the 'their daughter' comment) on top of bringing shady people into your life. She may be your mother, but she ain't your mom. Is your Grandma still available? Talk to her, ask if you can stay with her. If your mom doesn't want you to, tell her to fix herself before you'll consider staying. Op, I know it feels shitty and unfair that you get left with garbage while other people have good parents, but you can do it dude. Power through this and I assure you, it will get better. Best of luck OP."

cpmq2c,YTA. At that point you should be paying rent FFS.
cpmt6v,NTA. He was lucky it was just your parked car and not a full head on collision where either he or the other driver died.
cpmulu,"NTA, I would be highly uncomfortable with this. Either she can stay 1-2 nights a week or help with rent."
cpmutk,"NTA. That’s a weird song for slow dancing. I love the song, but I can’t even imagine slow dancing to it."
cpmyfw,"NAH it’s nice that they want to spend time with you, but you definitely aren’t an asshole for not wanting to. Based on your post it doesn’t sound like you’re rude about it and imo it’s totally normal not to be close with housemates."
cpn1n6,"NAH. Bill saw your boobs, he'll live. He clearly sees the humor in it so I wouldn't worry about it. Some people might think Bill is the asshole for telling the story, but personally I disagree. It was a funny and lighthearted moment between friends and it doesn't sound like he was being a creep about it. You are overthinking it a bit."
cpn331,"NTA. K brought your boss into it? What an AH. Also, I’d quit if my boss told me I HAD to work weekends because I’m single and have nothing better to do. Screw K and your boss."
cpn62s,"YTA. If you have an issue, such as not receiving the correct amount, SPEAK UP."
cpn67z,Nta. You have the right to name your dog whatever you choose. Its funny and im sorry you moved to a place with no sense of humor
cpn7vd,"NTA it's always nice to ask especially if it is a fridge that they've allowed you to use for your food. I think it's fine to be upset, but maybe have a discussion with your in laws about specific issues/boundaries and requests you have rn. You can always relax the rules later on as you feel more comfortable, but it's good to have a strong basis for what is acceptable and what isn't earlier on so that this doesn't become a reccurring issue."
cpn9oq,[deleted]
cpna8u,"NTA 
I cannot fathom why they'd all be bent out of shape about it, whether they saw the photos as tacky or whatever else, your brother said he was going to post them? His wife dared you to post them as well?
You were just having fun, and honestly those pics sound hilarious, and all rather innocent."
cpnaag,[deleted]
cpnah8,"If the owners want you to stay on the project longer, they can ask you directly. NTA."
cpnbtb,"NTA, you traded it in for $300, he had enough to get it to the station, that’s their problem at that point. They wouldn’t sell it with much more gas in it either, so definitely don’t feel bad for doing the same shit they would."
cpncf0,"ESH, why wasnt this settled BEFORE  your friend had to take care of your dog for 12 days ?

You say it's disrespectful and rude to barter about this. It take 2 people to barter, you're starting at 225 and he's trying to negociate a higher price. He's starting at 600 and you're trying to negociate a lower price. Like you said, you are both disrespectful and rude."
cpncu6,"NTA. It's your relationship, not theirs."
cpndno,"YTA: High end dining has a lot more service involved than regular dining.  You need to use standard tipping.  So yes, the server was absolutely, and justifiably, upset that you shorted him.  If you can't afford to handle a standard tip, you have no business going to that establishment."
cpnf68,[deleted]
cpnfuk,[deleted]
cpngpe,"NTA, if your husband is so obsessed with not wasting the water, let him take a cold shower for 5 minutes until it warms up and then boot him out. What a crap thing for him to try to micromanage or shame you about. Asthma or not, you have a right to choose not take a shower that’s too cold for your body. He doesn’t get a say in how you bathe yourself. If he wants to save the environment, he needs to find a more productive way of doing it than nagging his husband about his shower habits, ffs. (Edit: a word)"
cpnlbk,NTA- it sounds like your daughter was actually the one to point out the embarrassment which at the end of it all was you respecting her decision. Maybe you letting him know that could be a wake up call for him but of course under the right circumstances
cpnmwc,"NTA your roommate is a piece of work. You are attracted to who you are attracted to. It's mind-blowingly stupid to try and convince you otherwise. You're not attracted to female genitalia. Cut, end of story, that's it, no further explanation. That is how attraction works for CIS straight folks, otherwise you would not identify as straight. Your roommate is a jackass."
cpnnp3,"I hope this is a shitpost, because that is both bad mothering AND bad skincare. NTA."
cpno5b,"NTA Doesn’t seem like she gets it yet. Respect people’s privacy, property and appreciate favors. This is a pretty painless way to teach a valuable lesson."
cpnoft,"NTA - They were not friends, just roommates. Their actions proved that. You’re better off. I hope you are better now. :)"
cpnopz,[deleted]
cpnpbo,"YTA, but only a bit. Instead of saying you could get one if she volunteered 10 times you should have just said you could get one when you had a better living situation where you felt it would be ethical and humane to have a dog."
cpnpt0,"YTA I think. I'm not sure what things are like where you're from but where I'm from if someone asks for help with moving, you're helping with the whole thing, unless you specifically have the convo that you're busy until x time and you'll just meet them at the new place to help unload or something.

On top of that, this was a big deal for her. Her first place, her first move. You sort of just showed her she can't count on her family.

The fact that she left in tears and won't even look at you makes me think this might not be the first time there's been a miscommunication."
cpnrr5,"NAH, she apologised and that gave her closure. You can accept the apology and still go on your different paths in life."
cpnsq0,[deleted]
cpnvd4,"NTA. She's an adult who can pay for herself. If your roommate really feels that she shouldn't have to, then he can cover her half."
cpnvs4,"NAH It's natural that you feel restricted, you're normally respectful, this was an exception and no one wants to be shamed for pooing. 

It's not his fault for freaking out, OCD can be a torturous slave master.

Maybe stop over at r/OCD and ask for some advice on what steps to take towards therapy, and how to approach the issue with your boyfriend. OCD can't be cured, but can be managed better with the right support.

Edit; to suggest therapy"
cpnxo4,"Yta. Not intentionally, but please don’t take photos of other peoples children. We live in a world that has perverts and horrible people. While you didn’t have those sorts of intentions, the parents can’t/don’t know that. I’m assuming the culture is different where your from, and I don’t blame you for this instance. But don’t do it again, unless the parent has told you it’s okay."
cpny27,"YTA 

  
It is completely reasonable to tell someone they can't leave a 2 year old throwing a tantrum on their own. At that point your response of ""I am standing right here"" seems snarky to me as she probably watched you walk away. The only way I see to handle this is say something like ""Sorry I was trying to discipline her by pretending to walk away as she is still learning to not throw tantrums"" and then get your kid and walk away.

  
Starting an argument over a reasonable request is what makes you the asshole, not the disciplining itself."
cpnz2o,NTA; you relied upon your lawyer's advice.
cpo14a,"YTA... I think.

I find it very admirable that she's trying to learn French just for you (and possibly for meeting your family). That's quite the commitment and something you should support, not resent. She sounds like a keeper.

Maybe you can find a way to make teaching her French a fun experience or find some other compromise."
cpo1po,"NAH. You won't be the asshole, but you might well be unemployed."
cpo1y8,[deleted]
cpo29r,"As someone who has seen Indian news, it's pretty hilarious. The over editing, the zoom cuts, the animations, the YELLING. So yeah, I get it.

However. If it is going to hurt your parents and grandparents feelings, you'll have to bite your tongue and find it hilarious in private. You are an adult and can control your reactions.

If you keep laughing after she has asked you not to, and you're making her upset, you'll be a huge asshole. Kindness costs nothing. 

NAH"
cpo4qz,"YTA.

This case has been deeply divisive and hurtful for many communities. The fact that you look at this as a ""lol an internet celeb!!!!"" is pissing me off too."
cpo4s4,NTA - But you should reconsider this whole thing. 10 people under one roof and they already sound entitled? It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.
cpocqr,"Info.  How long have you been dating?  How old are you each?  My leaning is NTA, but if you have been together a long time and are close to engagement this is going to be more sensitive.  

I am an independent woman and wouldn’t have an issue with my fiancé taking a trip without me or extending a trip we had been on if I needed to head back."
cpoe9j,"NTA this is super weird. If anything the parents should ask your boyfriend to chip in, not you."
cpoear,"NAH. But is a week worth burning not only this bridge but potentially others in this small town.

Info: do you have another job lined up?"
cpof6t,"NTA, your friend is seeking to manipulate you. You're saying she considers you her best friend but is also saying you're a bad friend. This is typical gaslighting behaviour, be very careful and don't let yourself fall victim to it."
cpofwl,"NAH. But, it wouldn't hurt for you to be more consciousness of other's situation before you start your rant. Becuase, your friend does have it worse."
cpoip0,"NAH - I would suggest writing her a nice card/letter and maybe seeing if there's something you can do together on her birthday like go hang out at a park or something so she knows you still thought of her and didn't ignore her birthday completely.  
  
If she's truly a good friend she should understand that you don't have the money and should appreciate any effort you put forth to celebrate with her."
cpoix4,"YTA, you know she doesn’t like it but you still continue to do it"
cpol8q,NTA. Is there a counselor you can talk to at school? Things sound really overwhelming at home for you and like your mom is unburdening herself by putting too many of her problems on you.
cpom1c,"NTA

I was all ready to say it makes more sense to focus on the car since you also use it, but if this is a conversation about ways to get an additional car in the mix... yeah that's not going to fly. It sounds like you are sinking a lot of money into the situation under the pretense that she would be covering some of these expenses. You need to have a long conversation about how to make this situation work. Best of luck!"
cpoplf,"YTA

I don't understand why you couldn't like, give a spark notes about whatever it is you wanted to discuss? It sounds like a ""It's no big deal, just something I noticed about dishes,"" or ""I don't have a specific thing on my mind just want to get us all on the same page about chores"" sort of thing would have saved a TON of anxiety. Your weird vague texts and then insistence on remaining vague would make anyone feel anxious, and it all sounds so avoidable. Especially after they informed you they were stressing over it."
cporz8,"Oof YTA. They don’t know him. You might know him, but they don’t know him. Now a stranger has potentially unlimited access to their home."

cpp1u6,"NTA, dads are often sensitive about watching their kids, especially their daughters, grow up and mature but at the end of the day, your sister will need to know to the proper name for her genitals so it's best to get it out of the way early."
cpp4os,"NTA. Why would you ever be an asshole for refusing to let a barely comprehensible drunk who's making unwanted sexual advances towards you sit on your patio? You're under no obligation to talk to someone regardless of their intoxication level, let alone if they're hard to deal with."
cpp55c,"NTA but unwise to do this as a ""snitching retaliation"".

Better to document the training you've given her, record her performance/results, and present it as a performance report to your boss at the appropriate time. She may well have been fired by then. 

But document, document, document. Every time you email her to correct her mistake, save it."
cpp55y,That message was soo cringy. You're not an asshole but damn. NTA
cpp7mv,"NAH. 

It's perfectly normal to want communication about issues in any type of relationship or environment. 

However, you may want to reconsider whether you two are compatible enough to be living together. We can't change the behaviour of others, but we can change how we react to it. and make choices based on it"
cppi7u,"YTA - there are a lot of reasons why someone's light can appear a lot brighter - having a load in the back of a ute or van or even with people in the back of smaller cars. 
Safe driving isn't about exacting revenge or showing people their own medicine. Grow up.

cppk17,NTA. Wouldn't have been a secret for much longer anyway.
cppk9u,"NTA. I lived in NZ for many years and participated in the drinking culture, but this behaviour is over the top. 

In my experience, people only change when they want to change; you really can't help them. You want to lift them up, but in the end, they drag you down. 

Best case scenario, they negatively taint your life in countless ways. Worst case, they cause you real pain and long-term trouble. 

His ex may think him fragile, but he might be less fragile than she thinks. Their breakup him didn't destroy him, and you don't see her going back to prop him up. 

Regardless, the fragility of any addict isn't your responsibility. You didn't make them that way, and you're not obligated to sacrifice your happiness for the sake of their addiction. That's all on them. 

Cut him off and don't look back."
cppke6,"NTA

Stop doing this to yourself. 
Find someone who cares about you a s much as you care about them"
cppnjm,"NTA but I can’t stop wondering why you didn’t just tell her you’re not supposed to use a metal spatula on a nonstick pan??

That part of the story isn’t even a housemate courtesy thing, it’s an “I don’t want to ruin our cookware” thing."
cppo0z,"Don't apologize, they're trying to force their religion on you. If anything they should apologize to you. Don't be a doormat, stand up for yourself if your wife won't. NTA."
cppuss,ESH because by ditching the recital you caused problems to everyone else in the performance as well. But I definitely think your father is a much bigger asshole for ignoring or just being blind your wishes and forcing you to continue doing something you're not interested in.
cppw7k,NTA but just check to make sure your local laws don't have some weird ordinance against musicians in public without a permit. Even if you are just playing for yourself it only takes one asshat to complain to ruin your fun.

cpq37o,"> Get an actual job and stop living like a 12 yr old.

... What? How is that different from any actor, professional sports player, etc. He's an entertainer. He's making a living wage with it. Because he's not stacking boxes in some warehouse doesn't mean it's not an actual job."
cpq63e,"YTA the world doesn't revolve around your likes and dislikes, in polite, grown-up society we express interest in other people's lives and milestones. You went out of your way to be a brat, grow-up."
cpq74i,"ESH - You couldn’t be bothered to deal with an “angry, middle aged white woman”. If I said that I can’t be bothered to deal with angry black women I would be labelled a racist asshole, so the same should be said when you say the same about a white woman. To be honest, mentioning race at all when it isn’t a relevant factor makes you seem racist to me. But that being said, it sounds like her parking sucked in the first place so you both suck."
cpq85h,ESH except the kids. They were promised a vacation and even gave up Christmas presents to get it apparently. They deserve a vacation. You and your husband need to put on your big kid pants and plan the vacation.
cpqd4m,NAH
cpqexw,"NTA. Invite who you’d like! There’s no telling she’d even feel comfortable there with people she’s now barely talking to. Friends drift apart, it happens."
cpqh6m,NTA that sounds like an abusive parent alright...
cpqlad,"NTA - Your friend just doesn’t understand tipping culture in the UK. There’s no expectation to leave a tip here. If she wants to leave a tip that’s fine, but it doesn’t mean you have to as well."
cpqp4v,"NTA 

> I told her that if she decides to leave i will support her and help her out but if not i can't keep being friends with her and put myself and the people around me in danger

She is your friend. It does not seem like you are hers. I would wish her the absolute best of luck and make distant any communications."
cpqqhn,"I think the fine line between YWBTA and NTA here is how you approach the topic with him. Simply clarifying the truth of the situation as you have here doesn't make you an asshole. However actually asking him not to bring her, would."
cpqs06,"NTA for throwing her out for this.

But, YTA for not telling her why and for giving her only 2 weeks.

The 2 weeks window would be reasonable if you  had given her an ultimatum some time back about getting her shit together but out of the nothing only 2 weeks time? Big asshole move.

Give her 4 weeks and tell her why she needs to leave.

So overall I would lean more towards YTA, not because of what you are doing but because of how you are doing it."
cpqskk,"Nta.  The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.  In other words, you don't have to have specific feelings because ""faaaaaaaaamily""."
cpqv5s,"NTA - Don't know your backstory but I'm going to pretend this is from a r/raisedbynarcissists view (meaning your mum would be a narcissist, but there's not enough info to clarify this). I'm just using this as an example so I can understand better because I'm in that position with my mother. 

Tell her to leave you alone and break all contact with her. If you can move at the earliest opportunity, change your phone numbers, your emails, anything you have so she cannot contact you. Even maybe go as far to getting your sister to change all her contact details as well as you and your fiance (if your sister is in the same position as you, which I'm going to assume she is).

So your parents go away for the weekend, leave you in charge of the house (that you're living in rent free) and they come back to find that you didn't walk the dog properly, left shit all over the garden and didn't wash up? If it wasn't for that fact that they have (according to you) ignored the fact that you're depressed then it'd be a solid YTA. I'm assuming here that you've had your depression diagnosed and are getting treatment? If not then you're even more of an arsehole because it's prefectly possible that you're self-diagnosed depression is, in fact just as they say - moodiness."

It's not about being ""man enough"".  But it's unfair if you too demand financial compensation after the fact when you didn't set the expectation with her prior to that.  If you expect her to contribute, it's reasonable to discuss ahead of time, especially if you are doing the planning.  

That being said, I do think that expecting her to contribute as a general principle is fair.  But you have to do better about communicating it and adjusting plans if there is no agreement on her participation.  Be specific about what you are asking for, ask in advance, and be willing to discuss alternatives if no agreement can be made."

Maybe try to put yourself in her shoes and imagine what that would be like - to be dealing with something so shitty it fucks you up to the point you can't go to work at least once per week, and then you find out that your classmates are making fun of you and turning your sadness *into a fucking game*.

None of this is your fault, but you cut off your only avenue to her life by not attending this wedding.

cpwcwl,"YTA- you had me at “My parents made me get a job when they originally agreed I could chill this summer”. If you’re not in school (and hell for I’m assuming most of us even if you are in school) work is going to be a near lifetime responsibility. The fact that your dad A) found you a job, and B) found one for you in a high pay starting position (any construction job I worked paid waaaay better than minimum wage) was a favor for you. 

Then you got to the point of you being less healthy because you’re not getting to the gym. Unless you’re trying for a specific sport/ activity where muscle twitch and certain balance maneuvers are needed working construction can be about as good as you can ask for workout wise. Try and think of everyday as a work out and if you can prove yourself useful you’ll probably stop getting teased by your fellow crew members. The reason they are picking on you (outside of the fact that you sound like a complaining little bitch) is that they usually get paid better by the work they do and having you around slowing things down and pouting about it being early is hurting their bottom line.  Even if they don’t get paid by the tonnage of work, watching someone else slouch while you bust your ass will piss anyone off. I have a hard time thinking you’d be relegated to water duty if you had shown enthusiasm to learn. 

A lot of people work construction when they’re young,  some make a living off of it and some use it as motivation to make sure they stay in school and get the education they need.

YTA. From what I gathered, you agreed to watch the dogs, and left early because of some last minutes flights you booked while you mom was gone.

cpxm3z,"NAH.  It’s fine if you don’t want to hear about your ex every single day.  She also checked with you before she started this friendship with your ex and you gave her the all clear.  It’s unfair for you to expect her to drop a new friendship just because you say so.  Make an agreement with her that you’ll make no comment about their friendship, and in return she’ll say nothing about it in your presence."
cpxnut,"YTA. Friendship is based on a desire to hang out, not an obligation to hang out. If you've made it clear that you'd really like to see her, and she's still all shoulders, then having an awkward conversation about it won't help."

cpxuvh,"YTA: The best case scenario is that there's a better way to present your point.  Band is about uniformity, about being a team rather than an individual. Sports teams practice in uniforms, even when that uniform is nothing more than a t-shirt and shorts.  The point being made by your director is that you're a single unit at all times, and that means you behave like one.

If, somehow, a t-shirt and shorts is a hardship for you, then you need to present that case with reason, rather than just saying that you think it's dumb."

cpy31l,YTA as much as tinder accounts can be funny because of the stupidity of them it's still a dating app meant to be used for by people who are actively looking or interested in finding a date.

She approved she eventually learned she didn't like the idea of it and if you respect your relationship it's as simple as finding enjoyment in other things.

That tells me next to nothing. Rent is usually the biggest expense in someone's monthly budget.

Savings interest is basically nothing. It'd probably be more valuable as an emergency fund that she also enjoys.

>She will continue to work in the fall, while I will be a full-time student working on my master’s degree.

This is the bottom line. It's not *your* money. She earned it. It's hers. It'd be nice if you both were on the same page, and it does honestly sound like she's letting the habit get a little out of hand. But this really boils down to trust and control. From the way you described it, YTA."

cq1k5p,"NAH. 

I'd check in with your wife over whether the black jokes have been bothering her in general or it's just this, and  why so you understand her personal boundaries with this stuff better. Just in case there's a bigger problem. 

In general, It's ok for our senses of humour to be different. It's ok for you to have a natural physical reaction to a oke that she finds offensive. 

In this case, being black she is more well equipped to say whether someone crosses a line generally and she's the only one who decides what crosses a line for her specifically. but it's still ok for you to have an initial laughter reaction."
cq1ped,"> She asked about it and I told her not to worry and that she would really like it.

> She refused to even watch five minutes of it or give it a chance simply because I chose it without her

These two statements contradict each other. 

She wasn't upset initially. It was only *after* She asked about what you were watching and you wouldn't tell her that she became upset. I don't know how the conversation went, but from the sounds of her reaction she may have asked a couple of times. 

She's telling you that she doesn't like not having that communication. she doesn't like choice being taken from her. 

>  I’m getting a bit frustrated and I just want to know, was I the asshole for choosing a movie without her?

No. 

YTA for calling her reasoning silly instead of listening to her feelings on an issue she obviously feels strongly about"

cq1yhw,"NAH

I don’t think you can tell her not to go if this is something she’s had to ‘take care of’ her whole life. I think you could try to bring it up in conversation and ask how she feels about this situation and what she would want to do about it if she had a choice. You can support her decision or offer any help you can. 

You can’t change her parents 80 years of behavior but you guys can change how you react to it."
cq22xq,"NTA, but from what you've told us, I'd be willing to bet that your friends don't hate you; they just didn't realize how much their words were affecting you. I've been in a similar situation, and that's precisely what the issue was. I don't think you've done anything wrong, and if you think that cutting out your friends is good for your mental health, then go for it. But I think that you will end up feeling *worse* after you neglect talking to them for a while. Everyone needs friends; it's human nature. I'd recommend finding a supplementary friend group if you can, and consider rejoining your old friends if and when you're ready."
cq27ws,"NTA. Calling her stupid probably won't help, but a lot of time nothing does until something actually does happen."
cq28a6,NTA. You are demonstrating respect in a way that the majority of people in your area like to receive it. That is friendly and hospitable. It’s like taking your shoes off in houses that have no shoes rules. Is that offensive? It’s the opposite. It’s accommodating their mores.
cq29cb,"NAH - for asking to see the apartment and current residents saying no.

YTA for asking a 2nd time.

Your landlord is TA as well - I've never heard of leasing an apartment sight-unseen. That's weird.

My parents were landlords for years. When tenants were moving on, they'd show the apartment to new tenants. In the lease, it was indicated they could show the apartment to prospective tenants with 24 hours notice."

cq2cm0,"In general I agree with what you're saying, but I kind of feel like YTA for thinking that you get to be an arbiter for what he's allowed to spend his money on. Whether or not he needs or deserves unemployment is one question, but once the money is in his hand I kind of feel like he's free to spend 100% of it on cigarettes and then starve. You know what I mean? People face consequences for their poor decisions. He's not currently because his parents are bankroling him, but he's mostly harming himself by not prioritizing things in a reasonable way. 

To be clear - you're under no obligation to be this guy's friend. I probably wouldn't be his friend."
cq2d5j,YTA - Do you *truly* think pouring on her is going to make her listen? Take a step back and really think of it and put yourself in her position- that is *literally* only going to make matters worse and will absolutely not lead her to listening. This is silly to even consider.
cq2ek7,YTA. You can be nice and ask them to bring it to your door.
cq2fy0,"NAH. At some point you're going to have to live your life. Is it selfish to move out and have her fend for himself? I'm not going to mince words here. Yes, it is. But it's the sort of selfish that's justifiable and right. Your mom needs to move on and regain some of her independence. Unless you're willing to have her lean on you forever, I think it's better to cut the cord earlier rather than later. 

Some things that can help out are - if you want to help her out with utilities, even something basic like water, that would be nice. You can also help her connect with some resources that cater to the elderly. She may also benefit from talking to a professional about her grief, and moving on from it, and also achieving independence."
cq2ge7,"NAH. If that's what she wanted you to spend the money on, **she should have told you**. Then you could have talked about it some more and worked things out."
cq2geg,YTA for the piss poor excuse. As long as you drop off the friend first I really don't see the problem it's not like you'd be alone with her. If there was an issue you didn't try to figure out if they'd be cool with that or not. Just admit that you didn't want to and chose the lazy way out.

cq2n5n,Agreed NAH. you're probably going to be recovering that Friday anyway after getting the tooth removed.
cq2nbt,"The boundaries and weights on relationships and family are pretty difficult to navigate before marriage, even if rings are already involved. I can see why she feels more comfortable with her dad's judgement in this matter, especially as a female if she doesn't know anything about cars. That is a very difficult area to navigate in that position and she has a lifetime of heeding her father's advice vs. A few years of learning yours.

On the other hand I think you went about things fairly reasonably with trying to set a budget and plan for something that works for both of your futures. I myself am a ""drive it until it cant be fixed"" kind of person so I can appreciate that.

Ultimately I think NAH. The fact of the matter is you do not live with her or even in the same area. You are engaged but plenty can go wrong. And this is her car to drive, not yours. It seems you were both trying to make a joint decision but you have different ideas as to what level of involvement the other is currently entitled to.

This is not a relationship ending situation. You have much bigger fish to fry in the next few years, namely housing and children, which are much more costly and harder to get out of. Take this as a learning opportunity to have some honest conversations with each other about how you each expect these major decisions to be made after tying the knot and how you can compromise."
cq2p1w,"YTA for referring to this person as your “3rd best friend.”   What a middle school way to phrase your relationship to this person.    Do you rank all your friends in order of importance to you?

This could be a great way for her to make friends!"
cq2rcq,"Unpopular opinion, NTA.

If the teacher had a problem with you not bringing enough for the class, they could have reached out to you instead of embarrassing a child in their care.

I know sharing is an important skill to teach our children, but entitled behavior is also something we should be concerned with as well. Your kid isn’t friends with the whole class and this was something special you did for him and his friends—that’s the way the world works.

You probably should have notified his teacher that you planned this special surprise and then she could have suggested you make enough for the class or to do this before/after school.

cq2zay,"YTA because you disregarded her social status by telling others about things she would have liked to be secret, this is a major offense to a teenaged girl, it is a violation of her trust.

cq310s,"NAH. It’s been a week since her boss told her not to come in anymore. She’s obviously dealing with a lot at the moment - illness, being sent home, financial pressure, etc. Applying pressure isn’t going to help right now.

cq32au,YTA because this was previously the arrangement and now that the bf has his own place you dont list any additional reason that the bf shouldn't be spending his time there other than that you want alone time.

Was the lighting ever meant to be touched?? No. Was it obvious that your lack of supervision caused the incident? Yup. Did the staff do ANYTHING to injure your child?? Nope. 

The staff likely had to apologize to other customers, as YOUR kid wailing after being injured very obviously disrupted the meals of other diners, which could very easily lead to lower tips for the servers. Should they apologize for being hands-off and trying to mitigate the damage with the other customers? Hell no. They weren’t rude.

ETA: I find it appalling that you complain about the price of the food (did you not look at or ask the price of the food when you ordered??), that you complain about being stared at (screaming preschoolers tend to cause that, especially when they’re injured due to lack of supervision), and that you missed out on saying goodbye (again, due to your own fault). I do hope your child is okay, but HOW is this any fault of the staff??"

Not for your desire to sell the jewellery though - you both have different priorities re: the jewellery, and that's fine.

What bothers me is your attitude towards it all.

> I’m thinking it would be really petty to give it to the cousin when she sees her maybe once a year or so.

There's this, which bothered me the most.

This is a really shitty outlook to take - your MIL dearly values her jewellery, and doesn't want it to leave the family. She would rather have your wife's cousin have it than it leave the family, and I fail to see the pettiness in it at all.

It's one thing to say 'I'll make the will conditional so that any money made by selling it goes to charity' or whatever, but you both have different and equally valid outlooks. If she's petty in wanting to give it to the cousin, you're petty in viewing the jewellery as your ""right.""

Then there's the fact that you're planning on what do with the jewellery to begin with - you, not your wife, AKA the person who will inherit the jewellery.

If she passes on the stuff, it won't be to you, but to your wife - and if you're planning on selling it already without your wife's input, you're a massive asshole. Please do remember that while you see this as a massive money suck, for your wife they may well be sentimental mementos of her mother that she isn't willing to sell, and pushing her to do so regardless of her wishes would be a dick move.

cqaujx,"NTA

Your mother shouldn't be making promises to kids that aren't hers!

She's your daughter, so you set the rules. Your mother just has to accept it."
cqayj8,"ESH. She should be accommodating and supportive to your needs. You sound like you’re being overly dramatic, because when my iPhone is at minimum brightness and with night shift on, it does not fill a room and would not reasonably disturb anyone. May I offer you a sleep eyemask?"
cqaztd,"NTA but I think you need to tell your in-laws straight why you don't want to go. They're despicable places. If they don't get it, tell them to watch Blackfish."
cqaztq,"So you have a shitty family that's mistreating your partner... and instead of supporting them, you arguing with them and then don't go with them after your family pushed him to the breaking point? YTA."
cqb6n8,Lol people know what scalping is you don’t need to explain the concept of bulk buying tickets at a cheap price and reselling
cqb9lq,"YTA - You say that you ""thought it would be fun"" to try new foods, even though she has repeatedly and explicitly told you she's not an adventurous eater. You're not her mom, and while I can imagine you are in a frustrating position as virtual stepparent to a teenager, you really aren't doing your relationship with her any favors by insisting on pushing your likes and tastes on her instead of trying to understand hers."
cqb9sc,"~~ESH so long as you’re unwilling to talk to your father about the problem. He may not be aware that he’s acting this way, esp. if he hasn’t dated in like a decade. He’s likely just swept up in romance again.~~

~~Give him a chance to fix the problem, then if he still behaves terribly, drop him like a sack of hammers.~~

Nevermind, this father is a garbage pile. NTA all the way."
cqbb81,"ESH. Sounds like she could have given better service, but they were also going to seat you guys in a certain place for a reason. It was rude of you to join them, especially if they were finishing up and you were just getting started."
cqbbkv,"NTA. How could someone be upset that you've done their chores for them? He should be thanking you.

If if was truly important to him he'd make sure you didn't get the chance to do the dishes for him and would do them before you could."
cqbdy4,"NTA but why not start slowly by just asking how Mike is and ""What did you & Mike do over the weekend?"" I can imagine your dad is very anxious that you've inherited your mother and step-father's values. Why not make the first move and just let him know that a) you're not homophobic and b) you accept that Mike is an important person to him whatever their relationship actually turns out to be? By the way, your maturity about this and the way you wrote about it is commendable."
cqbeno,"NTA. Your dad is the patient and he has the right to keep his medical information limited to the people that need to know. Causing worry for something simple is unnecessary, especially when dealing with older people. 

Once things got complicated your mom made the decision to let other people know. Your family got together and made sure everyone was taken care of. 

You’re good, don’t worry about it."
cqbfgv,"Honestly YTA, Not for wanting to give your kid a name that doesn't sound ""trashy"" but because you call your wife dumb and think you're the only smart cookie that can make important decisions. Get off your high horse."
cqbg97,"NAH - I think the real issue is flying that late into a pregnancy and if she feels comfortable with that. Either way, you need to work this out together."
cqbh8d,"NTA. If someone makes you uncomfortable, you are under no obligation to continue interacting with them."
cqbhfo,"YTA. Stop and think for a minute what sorts of disgusting things those 14 year olds are saying to your CHILD. You don’t think they’re asking if she’ll follow in her aunty’s footsteps? 

It’s beyond her capabilities right now to be expected to support the sex industry while she is directly being HURT by it. Do you understand? This is currently doing serious harm to your daughter and she is angry at her aunt because it’s not her aunt who has to wear these consequences, it’s your 14 year old daughter. Her aunt got to make a choice to do this work as an adult. Your daughter is a child and did not sign up for this shit she is going through.

And right now, it feels as though you’re dismissing her pain and prioritising the aunt who isn’t being harmed nearly as much as your child. 

For god’s sake, HELP YOUR DAUGHTER right now and worry about your sermons about sex work later.

Also: she doesn’t have to like sex work. She doesn’t have to support it or agree with it in any way if she doesn’t want to. She’s entitled to have her own opinion on the matter, and no doubt this experience is shaping her opinion."
cqbhvu,"YTA. It would be different if he specifically mentioned that his daughter was a model to you in a conversation, but because you just figured it out through context clues when he addressed the whole class, it was probably really out of left field for him. There is also a certain connotation to being a fan of a model if you're a boy (you don't mention your gender), so if you are a boy, that is probably at play too. 

I think you should consider that the TA knows your professor a lot better than you do, and even though he was being polite, she might have more insight into how he actually feels about these kinds of requests (either because he's had them before and complained about them to her or because she can read his body language better than you because they have a history of working together). 

And also consider that asking anyone to reach out to their daughter on your (a near stranger) behalf isn't necessarily a simple request, especially because you don't know what kind of relationship they have. Maybe he doesn't agree with her career, maybe she's estranged from him, maybe they live in different countries so there's a logistical problem, maybe they're in a fight right now, maybe she's sick, etc. The point is, you have no idea what kind of relationship they have with each other or if she lives nearby/is available to sign the magazine for you."
cqbjs4,"Nta I feel like neither you or the parents are assholes but the sister is for the racial slurs.

You can't be mad that they didn't show up to events when you told them not to if they were going to bring your sister. For the other events, they were public so she could show up but as for your own personal party they respected your wishes and didn't show up with your sister."
cqbjuc,NTA. Move out ASAP because obviously your mom doesn't understand boundaries.
cqbkfq,NTA. You are allowed to speak your truth about your childhood however you'd like. But be prepared because it sounds like your stepfather may double down even more and call you a liar.
cqbki3,NTA. You just want to make sure the birds are happy and healthy. Your brother shouldn't have bought them if he wasn't prepared to do the work.
cqbmtq,"I delete my old comments for a reason my friend, I don’t like to be stalked 🌈 🌈 🌈"
cqbpne,"YTA

There are still things you can do. For instance, diapers for dogs are a thing (my dad used them with his 18 year old dog). As for his anxiety please try *everything* you can for him. Getting rid of a dog because he has separation anxiety is possibly the most cruel thing you could do; he is upset because you're not there so you disappear completely?

I get that he is a challenge, but this statement isn't enough:
> We've enjoyed having him as a dog

Dogs are family. He might be a small part of your life but you are everything in his. He doesn't deserve to be cast aside (or killed) because he is an inconvenience. Figure it out."
cqbtrd,"NTA.

Sick of all this bride and groomzilla bullshit being worried about their guests or wedding party distracting from the day.

I'm getting married next year. The bridesmaids are wearing navy but they can choose their styles and hair. I want them to be comfortable and to enjoy themselves. I wouldn't want them worrying about upsetting me because they made a personal choice for themselves.

People get way to in to themselves when their wedding comes up.

Your tattoo choices have sod all to do with them."
cqbwze,"NTA cos wtf?
Dogs regularly chase and kill squirrels for fun? What the fuck did she think would happen? Report her ass for sure"
cqbyrl,Don’t know if YTA but there are two times I never give friends relationship advice: 1) when they ask for it and 2) when they don’t.
cqc1lo,"NTA. They want to call names and yell, they can Uber from here to eternity."
cqc4bb,NTA. She could have gotten you fired. She was the one doing illegal shit.
cqc6fd,"NTA. Protect yourself first, especially in situations that involve a stranger. It sounds like your judgement is based on your mom's past actions, not based on assumptions about this specific person."
cqcb8y,NTA. Although I wouldn't let an otherwise avoidable crash happen over being petty about it.
cqcbx5,"NTA. She may have had good intentions, but once you made it clear you didn't want her to do your laundry, she needed to respect that boundary."
cqcca5,I’m the asshole for not being able read past those names
cqcdin,"You’re not the asshole. They’re doing it for charity, you’re not. Give em a good deal if it makes you feel better."
cqcfo2,NTA - That's a really big ask and a huge overstepping of boundaries. Honestly I think you dodged a bullet - someone who is willing to ask this of a co-worker they're not that close with is probably the kind of person who has no issue overstepping other boundaries as well.
cqchrw,She's an adult and can drink if she feels like it. Am I wrong?
cqcht3,"YTA. Let me help you with your communication skills. You should have told her this last night instead of keeping her on read. 

""Hey mom, I'm not sure, I'll check with them in the morning and get back to you asap. By the way, Thank you so much for helping me not lose my home, I appreciate all the help and love you. Talk to you in the morning!""

Your mom is freaking helping you keep your house. You're taking her for granted and jumping down her throat. You don't mention what your deadline is, but I'm guessing it's tight enough that it's stressing your mom out. Take your mom's feelings into account here, since she's the reason you still have your house."
cqcj3r,"NTA. You tried to do something nice for her grieving family. The trip was never supposed to include you. You should probably distance yourself from your ex, as she's obviously going through a lot right now & can't quite handle being in contact with you still."
cqcm7h,YTA. Why get involved? Let the brand decide who they want as their models.
cqcmv5,"NTA

But fully expect that they don’t fire him, and he cranks up his harassment of you. Quite frankly because he’s not white, they probably won’t fire him over racial comments unless he was saying them to customers and a customer complained. I also wouldn’t be surprised if they decided to fire you instead since firing a 16 yo that has had disciplinary issues no matter how bullshit they were (you said he almost got you fired so I’m assuming someone higher than him was informed) is a whole lot easier than firing a minority adult supervisor."
cqcmwx,"NTA - he's an adult, it's not your fault if he goes back to cigarettes"
cqcn21,"I'd say r/relationship_advice is better for this.

but to comment on your actual question of would you be the asshole if you left. I'd say NTA, you had a clear cut decision that you wouldn't go if he worked late. He worked late so he violated that agreement that you had.

Expect him to be mad, but you can be justified for that alone."
cqcn3v,It's perfectly reasonable for someone not to notice damage to their helmet after it was humped by a dog. That doesn't mean you aren't responsible for the damage. YTA.
cqcpeb,"NTA

Tell your boyfriend he’s right, next time you’re approached by anyone you’ll close your eyes, hands over your ears and start yelling “LALALALALALALALALALA”"
cqcpu8,"The email said that ""if there were others open"" not to use the handicapped stall. It does not mean you'd have to wait. It only means you can't choose a stall that would actively inconvenience others. YTA."
cqctxj,"YTA.  You're asking a bus driver to somehow keep an entire bus full of school children quiet, WHILE DRIVING, just for your child?

No.

I empathize, as I'm sure raising a severely autistic child is no picnic, but it isn't reasonable to ask everyone to cater your your child's needs.  If he can't be on a bus without having a meltdown, stop making him take the bus.  Either drive him, find someone else to drive him, or get him a cab/uber.

EDIT: OK, I get it people.  We do not have ride share programs where I am from, I didn't know the rules on who cam take an Uber/Lyft.  Calm down."
cqcuom,"NTA, but it sounds like you're living in a pretty toxic environment and you're enabling toxic behaviour. Telling your mother this doesn't make you an asshole, I would say worse things at this point. If you have your disease under control, and it's at all possible, stop living with your parents. In the end if she doesn't want to help herself there's nothing you can do about it."
cqcvid,"NTA this sounds like they are trying to manipulate the situation to get unsupervised access to your children. Without question, that sounds messed up and you are right to say a hard no!"
cqd1rk,"NTA

You erred on the side of telling him early, but if I were in his position I would want to know as soon as possible so I could work out the logistics and the financing. I think most people would agree. You didn't tell him you WERE pregnant, just gave him a heads up that you might be, and that you might want his support in terminating if that were the case. None of this is unreasonable, like, at all. In fact I would be thrilled to get that level of communication from a fwb who I had such an agreement with (no condoms).

He overreacted like \*crazy\*. His response should have been, ""I doubt you're pregnant but thank you for letting me know. Give me updates as soon as you have them, and if I have to, I'll make time to be there for the termination."""
cqd2ui,NTA. Sounds like they deserved it.
cqd3k9,NTA. Karma's a bitch.
cqd5kb,"NTA.

>“You need to tell Mommy she should put a baby in her tummy”.

What!?   

Your mom is actively manipulating a 5 year old. She does not respect you or your husband's autonomy on the matter.  She is projecting her desires incredibly invasively.  

NTA."
cqd6el,"NTA. JFC NTA! you're a LGBT person married to a woman and your mom wants to take her to THAT church?!?!

*What's wrong with her?

Edit:corrected type-o"
cqd7pb,"YTA - the app is LITERALLY designed for this purpose. If you're so upset, YOU do the navigating."
cqd897,"YTA. You know, part of me worries I'm being overly judgmental, and I have no issue with recreational drug use in general, but you know what? I don't think when you have young kids you should be taking hallucinogens that put you out of commission for hours at a time. What if there was an emergency that absolutely NEEDED you-- like your daughter was seriously hurt and in the hospital? Same goes for getting completely shitfaced wasted. So I don't think you're TA for not going when you legit couldn't, but I think you need to hold off on psychedelic adventures till your kids are grown."
cqd9s0,"NTA. Her family is steamrolling you. It's also unhealthy to stuff yourself past the point of being full.

If they haven't been exposed to other cultures before (counties that aren't America aren't melting pots), then I can see how they wouldn't understand that other people don't do things like they do. But it's still unpleasant of them to always get pissy when things don't go their way. What are they, children?"
cqddo4,"Nah, she reads and listens to music, mostly. I think she was watching YouTube atm"
cqdei7,"NTA. It sounds like you two are close enough that you had standing to say this to her. Of course, now she's within her rights to not really want to discuss it with you anymore - and that might be a good outcome for you, since you at least don't have to hear about it."
cqdidr,">As the driver I feel entitled to go **as initially discussed** and am fully prepared to drive up with D on Thursday night, while leaving T to find his own ride.



But it wasn't discussed, at least not with T:

>Somehow T was left out of these discussions and didn’t know that we were going to head up Thursday. He assumed that the 3 of us would drive up together on Friday.

It's not a weird assumption to make. If the three of you couldn't get Thursday off it's not a big leap to assume you'd leave the next possible day, instead of after a long day of work. 11pm is also pretty late... So late in fact that i don't see how it's such an imposition to leave Friday early when you'd be arriving on Thursday after midnight otherwise. So you're either going to bed really late or getting up really early. There's no real time lost there. 

I also think it's weird how you can forgive and accommodate the person who was in the loop and was flaky and double booked, but not the one who was out of the loop. 

YTA, learn to communicate with all parties properly. JFC, it's only the three of you. It's not like this was a group of 20+ that needed to coordinate something."
cqdle6,"Everybody wants a sugar daddy, til it's time to give daddy some sugar"
cqdlg1,"NTA I’ve been in a position where my group mates have been utterly useless and refused to do any work or if they did, they got it completely wrong leaving others to pick up the pieces by putting in extra hours of work.

The worse thing, they don’t even care about what they’ve done and take it that since you’re there to pick up after them, they can take a step back.

 I don’t think you stepped out of line by approaching the lecturer because why should you get the same grade as them when you’ve put so much work into it.

Sure it may be alittle harsh for them but it might be the wake up call they need to work harder and focus more on learning the necessary skills in class."
cqdnhu,"NTA. She’s trying to redistribute blame, but what she did is not cool. It’s perfectly natural and healthy to reach out to friends to talk about relationships anyway to get outside perspectives, but you were doing more than that - you were worried about your girlfriend’s safety. Even if she was upset with you, she should have done the mature thing and let you know that she’d be out for the evening but that she was safe.

However, I will say this: thinking that your relationship is perfectly fine after essentially telling your girlfriend you don’t see a long-term future with her is pretty thick-headed. Of *course* she needed to think about and process what you said. That doesn’t excuse her behavior, but you should try to be more aware of the impact your words likely had on your girlfriend."
cqdoei,"NTA. Your supervisor deliberately caused a problem because she didn't trust you. Any consequences of that are on her, not on you. She's managing a workplace, not being the alpha of a middle school clique. More importantly - it actually doesn't matter! You get to take your allotted sick days for what you choose! Even if you were lying and you were drinking, it's your call!"
cqdol5,"NTA. If the spirit of the festival is to celebrate the relationship between brother and sister, then shouldn't how you and your brother feel about it be the most important thing? If your brother doesn't feel disrespected by it, and neither of you put much stock in the festival anyway, then no-one else should judge."
cqdrps,"NAH except your friends to be honest.

I don't see anything wrong with what your coworker said. You clearly haven't made any effort to engage with your coworkers at all which, fine, that's your prerogative. It seems to me like she was just trying to involve you a little more in the team by saying she'd seen you at the weekend. I really don't think it was designed to embarrass you, it sounds like a very typical social interaction, but I'm not going to call you an asshole for your reaction (although I think you've pretty much cemented that you will never have anything more than a formal working relationship with your coworkers).

Your friends suck for using phrases like ""be a man"".

Edit: typo"
cqdv0p,NTA but it should really come from your husband rather than you.
cqe0ni,Nta I wish my ex boyfriends had a sister like you. Dont be an enabler but you should expect backlash.
cqe4vg,"Absolutely NTA. Do not compromise on your identity for people who refuse to love you as you are. I wish you the best and hope you are able to fill your life with people who love you, regardless of how you identify."
cqe5w9,"Nta , but the wait could have equiled the time it took you to be  driving around to 3 different restaurants"
cqe6vv,"NTA but you've mixed up work and personal life, a big no-no."
cqe9rf,"NTA. Going off meds suddenly is never a good idea. It's definitely something he should discuss with his doctor, but it's not unreasonable for you to get upset that he was lying about it."
cqebpn,"NTA. This is a small red flag, the trust fund is none of her business and she’s not entitled to anything."
cqee47,[deleted]
cqegei,"YTA- ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"" I understand you were very grateful, but your manager is right; that is their job to give praise and your comment came off very snarky even if that was not your intention. You should have told the coworker in private since everyone there that night was probably also working hard."
cqegsa,"NTA. 

But you should know that this will hurt your career in an unsaid, unquantifiable way.  Part of the impression of being a great employee is fitting with the company culture and getting along well with your coworkers. 

I get it. I hate events like this at work, too. Not going makes you look like an outsider and it sticks out more than the people who go and don’t really make waves at the party. It’s almost better to go, then duck out early. That said, deciding to do work instead doesn’t make you an asshole."
cqehec,"YTA - they are just being friendly just quietly nod and accept it. 

Btw Exeter is a shithole."
cqek4w,"Wait, so she just up and moved, changed her number, never reached out for YEARS, and *you're* the one supposedly closing the relationship?? No, NTA. 

If she wants to own up to what she did (even if she had reasons, she should acknowledge she hurt you) and do the work to rebuild your trust that's one thing, but if she just wants to pick up like nothing happened, you're not TA for saying no."
cqetsc,"YTA (YWBTA)

Why would you do this?  How does it impact you?  It sounds like you are being a busybody."
cqevlq,"I see why you're upset, but unfortunately, its your moms decision. my mom wanted to move when I was 15 in hs. that was rough starting a new school. it'll be ok. don't worry. NAH"
cqez30,"YTA. You seem to think that because he's not like you that he'll do poorly, when most likely he'll do just fine, but differently."
cqez34,[deleted]
cqf77v,"NTA  In fact, you were being quite reasonable with the request.  Your sister is acting like an entitled brat.  Personally, I would change the log in information so that she can't use Hulu anymore."
cqf8dv,"You didn't get a free coffee, you got what you ordered when they made a mistake. NTA."
cqfbvq,"NTA - stop replying to colleagues when you’re off the clock, since doing so is apparently grounds to pick at you 

Besides, you did reply, just not immediately.  That supervisor is a jerk"
cqfcum,"YTA 

Face it. You just did not give a memorable performance."
cqffdl,"NAH but I don't think asking for the key back would help. Without a key she can still show up and knock on the door. The issue is really the unannounced visits. 

 I think it's a conversation with your husband letting her know how much you appreciate her help but that you're ready to do these on your own, and need all visits to be scheduled for awhile to avoid throwing off the routine. 

If you do ask for the key back, I would keep it casual, like asking her to put it under x rock or planter so you can leave it for a neighbor or dog walker. And then eventually you remove it from that location, and in the meantime start setting boundaries about her visits. If she asks for it back you can say you guys decided you don't want spare keys floating around and will leave leave as needed for scheduled things."
cqfih1,YTA. You jumped to a conclusion that turned out to be incorrect and put this man's job on the line. All for what? You're not Batman. Did you think you were doing V a favor? Did you think you were standing up to teacher/student relations? It's absolutely not a problem in anyone's mind but your own. I would swallow my pride and apologize to the man and maybe even to V. How embarassing that must've been for both of them.
cqfkmi,"NTA - you are their child, not their servant. Your parents are ""adults"" so they can work it out. Go live your life and ignore this BS."
cqfnf6,"NTA - you watch your shows however you feel most comfortable. Your ""friend"" is a dick for taking that attitude.

I highly suggest you stop watching television and going to the cinema with him. Really not sure why you still do tbh."
cqfo9v,"NAH. 

You don’t like to go out the same way they do. They probably noticed & stopped inviting you out as much. No need to get upset over this because technically this is what you wanted. You don’t need to hang out with everyone in the friend group every time you hang out. Invite a couple friends over for brunch or a football game. You can still enjoy their friendship"
cqg13m,"NTA. An electronic is not in ""good condition"" if it cannot turn on. If she wasn't sure that it worked, she should have said something; and if it was an honest mistake, she should have apologized and given you a refund once she realized it was broken."
cqg2hp,"NTA - But it isn't stolen, suspend the service until she pays."
cqg49a,NTA. 15 min in a car is nothing compared to a 45 minute walk in the summer heat. I can’t believe you walked that far to get them in the first place that’s insane.
cqgfjb,"YTA. You had time to put his work jacket on the bag to try to make him take it out for you, but not time to step out the front door for 10 seconds and put it in the car? And then you ""made"" him drive an hour round trip to fetch it for you? Do you even realize how spoiled and childish you sound?"
cqgfvx,"> Really the whole conversation left the impression that, to say the least, they aren't his number one fans.

Understatement of the century. 

I'd say NTA. You telling him might just make him panic about trying to please your parents and end up with him trying to fake it with them or just feeling totally uncomfortable to ever come over cause he'll know your parents are constantly watching and judging him.

Seriously though, wtf kind of parent tells their child what they told you? That's beyond fucked up and judgemental."

cqggs5,"YTA - you’re not required to attend all of these events. you wouldn’t be TA for declining the invite, especially since you’ve been to a lot of events for them.

cqgnbl,"YTA because you've created a dichotomy of ""I wear this dress or something much worse"" and ""I wear this dress with a visible bra or with no bra at all"". You've picked a dress for the wedding, it seems, with the express excuse of going against the one thing they've asked you, and it seems pretty deliberate. You've got lots of other options, like buying a new dress that doesn't have this problem (especially considering if there's sideboob it's probably not appropriate for a wedding of people who think not wearing a bra makes you a hippie heathen whose abandoned God and is motorboating Satan.). There are also some age-old tricks for hiding bras under revealing dresses, as well as actual products meant for that purpose like strapless bras or that one backless bra thing you can buy online for like five bucks which also gives really great cleavage too. But seriously, just go buy an appropriate dress at freaking WalMart."

cqgx2a,"YWBTA, mildly. Losing touch with friends is common after graduating and moving away. You extended the invitation and they rejected it. Confronting them won't change their minds (well, you know them better than we do), and it won't benefit you either. Just move on and focus on your relationships at university."
cqh0tm,"I’m going to go with NTA. Nothing wrong with wanting to keep away from this toxic behavior. Also, good for you for standing up for your mother."
cqh0vh,NTA- And why isn't he like every sane person on the planet who leaves their phones on silent for the majority of the time?
cqh150,"NTA. There were recession warnings today, the market could turn and you are entitled to your money. However, I will say there’s no amount of money that can replace a parent. Many people would give anything to have theirs back. Please don’t let the money come between the relationship you and your father have."
cqh2r1,"NTA - It's your life, your decision. If you recognize that your decision might make others unhappy (and are aware of the impact), but make the decision you feel is right for you, not an asshole. 

You are single and childless, and THIRTY+. Your decisions are, and should be, unilateral. Accept input from other interested parties, and make the best decision you can. 

One of the people I studied abroad with had a family member get upset because we were ""going to Africa and it's dangerous there!"" We were going to a Central American country, with professors from school, and it was for 10 days. Some people are concerned (because they love you), but still wrong/misguided."
cqh33n,"NTA you don’t change the way you’ve spoken for you’re entire life from a single vacation. Honestly, your friend is making a fool out of herself... I think the best you could do is privately tell her once that it’s def not working, but (as predictably she’ll keep going anyway) let it go after that... it only looks back on her."
cqh488,"NAH. 

You are definitely overthinking it. 

Your friend is right, that most people can't understand how massive the museum is if they haven't been there. Seems like you're taking this personally for some reason."
cqh4j0,"NTA

Sometimes a demonstration is necessary. She was being extremely rude."
cqhclt,NTA.. Fuck him.  Eat up.  You don’t need a plate for a donut
cqhe3x,"NTA- if you’re the main lease holder and you pay the utilities and 2/3 people like it at 72, lock it up and put it on 72."
cqhhwf,"YTA. The dude is 6. Calling him a ""lost cause"" is super harsh."
cqhuyw,"YTA. A gift is a gift. Now she sucks for cheating, but that doesn’t mean you get your gifts back."
cqhv73,"NAH, I think she probably knows that you still don't believe it. You're doing it to comfort her, not to trick her or deceive her. It's just a nice thing to say when you know someone's having a hard time."
cqhv7r,"YTA  You admit that you brought an abusive partner into a relationship with your two small children, then alienated your family so there was no support system besides you and your abusive partner for 15 years. Even if you were young, you were the adult in this situation and it sounds like it traumatized both your children for 15 years.  You should have therapy along with both your daughters and paying for it would be a small price to keep your relationship with both your daughters.

Although it sounds like you are trying to say those years were no big because they came out of it safely, apparently they still feel traumatized. And you helped cause it. You need to do responsible and take care of your children, even if they're grown."
cqhviv,"NTA. Your other family that ditched the funeral and wrote their names on stuff are though. That is just dirty. I felt gross reading that.


Based on past experience, you know a written will is the best way to make sure your grandparents give whatever they want to give to whoever they want to give it to. Dont think of it like youre asking for their stuff. Think about it like youre asking them to write out a list of things they know for sure they want to leave to who. That way they can have peace of mind having it all figured out ahead of time. It doesnt have to be everything. 


My uncle only specified big things in his will, like the house, and the little stuff we divided amongst ourselves peacefully. I have a shirt that make me super happy because I get to feel close to my uncle when I wear it. I wouldnt trade that for anything, so I understand how important it is to you that you get the family history heirlooms.


Enjoy the time you have with your grandparents OP. Hope you figure out what youre gonna do."
cqhwaa,At this point I think you’d be more of an asshole if you went back and told her you cheated. She’s grieving and getting over you at this point and reaching out to drop a bomb like that would be more for your own guilt than for her benefit. I say let bygones be bygones.
cqhwlz,"YTA. My general rule is unless someone’s being malicious, don’t call the police. Particularly if you thought these men may be homeless. Why would you do that? If they can’t pay the fine, it’s very likely that they’ll go to jail."
cqhyfa,[deleted]
cqi0zt,YTA. Let your sister deal the way she wants to.
cqi6h8,"YTA - she's not a retailer, and it's your fault you didn't check it over thoroughly before paying."
cqidcn,"I'm a trans guy so I'll give you my perspective. Name changes are very important for trans people and this probably means a lot more to him than either you or your mom realize. Her reasoning about him being too young to make that big of a decision is off-putting and does kinda come off as playing into the idea that trans youth can't make decisions about their gender because they are too young. Your brother probably is already aware of his privileged background, especially if he lives in a conservative state with backwards laws. You really don't think he's aware that other people have is hard and that if he outs himself as trans in certain situations that it can put his safety at risk? YTA"
cqidu5,"NAH, moms do embarrassing shit, kids get embarrassed. It’s the cycle. Happens in every family."
cqij42,"NAH - It is your place too, and he didn't tell you that they would be coming over. If it was that big a deal, he should have said something."
cqin0d,NTA- You expressed legitimate concerns regarding their negative views on overweight individuals. These comments are very insensitive and disgusting and the fact that they did it in front of their overweight son?? You have no reason to feel bad at all.
cqin60,YTA. Pay the beast.
cqinsl,"NTA- Bad zoos are bad zoos, and you’re right in not wanting to support them. I think it was shitty of your husband to agree not to go, then do it anyways."
cqityk,NTA. What the fuck even is your mother
cqiurb,NTA you are legally allowed to turn but not compelled to do so. It’s a convenience to turn right on red. Making her wait for her impatience seems a fitting bit of karma.
cqivbj,"NAH - Everyone deals with death differently. The friend should have probably asked you if you wanted them there, and you should have been more vocal about your need for emotional support.

In my opinion, people give the support they would want.... whether that be distance or overwhelming support. Just because expectations are not aligned doesn't mean the person is not a great friend.

Water under the bridge now... can't change the past."
cqiwi2,"NTA. 

You break it you but it. Since the puppy is apparently his then it is in your full right to make him pay. If you want to be petty asshole, steal his keyboard until he gives you the money to buy a new one. Or you could try and reason with one of your parents or tell your aunt about they situation which may help."
cqiwxl,"NTA - it is nice to be kind to those around you but you are not her keeper.

Either have a conversation with her that things have changed and you will not be sitting with her. If you have concerns about safety then bring in a teacher or counsellor to help with the communication."
cqixme,"NAH you don't have to bring stuff back for your friends, unless some kind of promise was made saying you would. If you want to buy them things - go ahead. If not - don't."
cqixoy,"You are NTA and actually should be really proud of yourself for taking the high road and going to your sketchbook and Mario Kart as opposed to engaging your dad in a no-win situation. 

Your dad needs to channel his feelings elsewhere and it's completely unfair for him to expect you to take sides in their relationship. You don't owe him any explanation... You ought to tell him that it's between him and your mom and to leave you out of it."
cqiya3,"NTA. 

You are 14 and this sounds unsafe.  You can report your unsafe conditions to the police or DCS (if you are in the US).  For God's sake, stay in your room. Tell your mom he makes you feel unsafe.  If it is an option, talk to a teacher or school counselor about your situation.  They can help keep you safe."
cqiyw5,"I teach in a school with similar laptops. Not allowing outside laptops isn't to punish or inconvenience you; it's to make sure you are not usinng an outside laptop that may have a virus or be incompatible with some of the school's programs. 

I have a nicer laptop than my teacher laptop, and it's not permitted on the school's network, just like the student's personal laptops aren't.

You're NTA for asking but you are if you don't just let it go. Keep your nice laptop at home."
cqiyzg,"If you are both paying equally, chores should be split equally as well.  If he lived by himself or with a platonic roommate, he would have to do all his chores."
cqiz69,"NTA, you had no way of knowing the cat was close to home since the owner didn't yell out to you to get your attention.






Saving the cat from getting hit by a car was the right move. Hopefully the cat had just escaped outside and the owner isn't just fine with leaving it outdoors to get ran over."
cqj0hh,[removed]
cqj3nv,"YTA - **First** of all, it takes very little effort just to let a cashier know that two girls just stole something. **Secondly**, your argument that it's ""not your problem"" is flimsy at best if you had the time and energy to keep an eye on them after the fact and even confront them. **Thirdly** and most importantly, you not only let the two kids get away with stealing something, but you also essentially gave them the okay to continue stealing in the future ""as long as it's not from small family-owned stores"". They're kids already starting down a very slippery slope, and your response is ""you do you""? The best thing for them would have been to face the consequences the first time before they try it as adults and on something a little more expensive.

Believe me, I can understand the ""not my problem"" mentality, but that's not really what you did. If it were just you ignoring two teen shoplifters I would have 100% said NTA. In this case it truly would have been better to do nothing."
cqj3xe,"NTA - When someone says hamburger, a bun is included. Your sister is a serial killer or something."
cqj4zp,"NAH - You helped your girlfriend and that was nice, but you REALLY should have asked your parents first. 

I understand their side of it. As adults, they are now responsible for her under their roof. Do they know for how long that's going to last? That's a major thing to ask, especially with her having anxiety and issues at home - and you didn't even ask. 

I wouldn't say you're an ""asshole"" because your intent was good, but I don't think you understood or respected your parents side of it."
cqj5cx,"NTA. I'd look for a gentle way to mention it, that you saw her do this and it made you concerned because you would not feel safe doing that with their child. That lets your employers decide how to approach their friends as they will likely be more familiar with their parenting style, and it doesn't come off as judgemental in case your employers are ok with it. I know I'd fire my nanny immediately for that personally, but do know some parents who would have no issues with doing exactly what she did."
cqj7ry,NTA. Cleaning should not ever come before schoolwork. I tried to do high school cross country and I quit after the third week because it was so hard- I totally believe you are exhausted. Honestly it seems a little misogynistic that your step-dad expects you to clean everything while he sits on his ass for 2 hours. Totally NTA.
cqj9cy,You are absolutely NTA. Its your choice anyways.
cqjbdt,YTA.  That's not a healthy or productive way of discussing his weight gain.
cqjdrj,"I am leaning with YTA because it sounds like she is making every effort to have you there.  Room paid, travel now all set, gift a non-issue.  She wasn't trying to hurt your feelings, just reiterate the importance of having you there."
cqji0k,"NAH. 

I feel like they aren't the assholes because you specifically mentioned the air conditioner and the engine. I'm no mechanic, but unless you mention the coolant, they won't check it because they probably thought something was wrong with your air conditioner.

Granted, maybe they should have, as a precaution, but it might not be worth complaining to because they might turn around and say you only mentioned the AC and the engine."
cqjk79,"If it's her bill, then she should be paying it directly. NTA

But you should have a backup plan for when she ""forgets"" and they cancel the service if you need it for work."
cqjkbu,NTA if they are being little douche bags and their good for nothing parents are not controlling them i would complain to the office in a heartbeat.
cqjkf9,"YTA, snoring is a condition, simply waking someone up isn't the fix.  He'll be snoring again in about 10mins.  I used to be a snorer, I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, I digress.  Your in a hostel, that comes with it.  I'd nicely talk to the man the next day, he may not even be aware he has a problem that ultimately could cost him his life if untreated."
cqjm2j,"Y T A for calling her out like that so publicly. You humiliated her, that really wasn’t necessary.

Edit: ohhh I thought you did it in comments. Ok, NAH. She’s being obnoxious but I don’t think asshole really. And you called her out but it doesn’t sound like you were too mean about it."
cqjnxn,"YTA (just a tiny bit). Actually it’s not that great for the environment to litter, even if it is biodegradable. Giving food to animals isn’t good (just like you shouldn’t give bread to ducks) even though it’s arguably more natural it’s still not something they would have in their diet. 

In addition, trash-food will usually attract flies, maggots, mice, possums etc. You did mention it’s hidden by a bush so I guess the latter point isn’t as important but yeah. Just throw it away. 

Also just a side note, depending on where you live you can actually get a ticket for littering biodegradable foods!"
cqjrrv,"NTA - that's disgusting. Nobody wants to see a bunch of food waste on the ground. It's not like it biodegrades in seconds. Also, shrimp? I've heard the orange peel thing before, but shrimp is just weird."
cqjvcr,NAH. You did something you thought was reasonable and the women with more life experience told you it wasn't and why.
cqjw44,"NAH- They told you privately that they don’t like her because you introduced her. You’re trying to spare her feelings, but you’re doing it at the expense of your other friends. Just because they don’t want to hang out with Candy doesn’t mean you have to stop. Make time for both."
cqjwjq,"But the thing is dad isnt a shitty person, we're just on different levels of emotional needs and the capacity to fill those needs.

Yeah he could improve in many ways but hell so could i. Im more upset that i cant visit him without seeing my stepmother, and i feel like i should almost be obligated to let dad ask if ive got a job yet, because thats his way of showing he cares."
cqjyg6,">A second bed just isn’t in our budget anytime soon

NAH

Get a cheap mattress from Ikea, and put it on the floor in another room. Sleeping in different rooms is likely your only logical option."
cqjyuq,"NTA- Joe got his own bonus taken away. It sucks because he’s probably just as broke as most people are, but if the first write up wasn’t a wake up call, then it’s on him."
cqjz4z,NTA. If his change of heart is only happening on his death bed then it seems insincere. He’s probably just lonely.
cqjz6x,NTA. You reached out plenty of times. The ball was in her court whether to contact you or not.
cqjzvq,"NAH. If she has the motor skills to open the cans on her own, the sharp edges probably don’t pose much more of a risk to her than to us as long as she’s been told to watch out. And you learn by doing! But, your MIL is coming from a place of genuine care and concern."
cqk0d0,"NTA. Regardless of the whole gaming thing, how the fuck are you supposed to fill out online job applications without WiFi???"
cqk1yy,"NTA. A general lack of consideration is not the greatest qualities for him to have as a partner. Name calling, even less so. Personally, Id seek out a better one. It's these ""little things"" that always matter most in the end, in my experience.

Edit: if they aren't paying you then he is only a mild asshole for not asking first, but still TA for calling you a bitch."
cqk4pa,"ESH. He held up traffic, but you caused an unnecessary scene. You really shouldn't honk at all except to alert someone that they're doing something dangerous."
cqk4wj,"YTA. Your love for her doesn't sound unconditional to me. A parent paying for a wedding is a gift. Gifts with strings attached are not gifts, they are manipulations."
cqk58u,"NAH. The only way you could get me in a Trump hotel at this point is for a protest, so obviously I'm biased. But I think you have to respect her feelings. The idea that it's tacky to talk about politics in mixed company might be a bit passé, especially given the political circumstances we're in right now, but I think the real issue is that you're worried she'll bring it up not for the sake of conversation, but to prove that she's right. 

In either event, tell her the bride asked people who want to talk politics not to come. The harder discussion is whether you should go, and that's one where both of you will likely have to listen to each other honestly. There's no wrong answer, really, but each of you has to be heard by the other."
cqk7ee,"ESH  Congrats on your engagement but let’s get through this. There’s nothing wrong with having a Halloween themed wedding, I think the idea is cool but you’ve gone astray. Requiring people to “dress up” is just silly, people can have fun at a Halloween party not dressed up so why ruin that special Halloween ideal. If your older relatives don’t want to support your marriage just because of the theme then they don’t need to be at your wedding.


Main point ; don’t make your guests dress up just for aesthetic"
cqk7h1,"NAH. It sounds like you were angling for something juicy and personal and that the interviewee's response made you question whether the question was off base in the context of that specific interview. And if you wondered, then maybe it was a little off base. But you're not an asshole. You asked a question, they didn't want to answer it. That's OK."
cqk94g,"NTA keep repeating that you'd loose custody of your child if he was allowed to live at your house. After that if your husband wants him in anyway? Say sure, but I'll be moving out with the kids/ kid the same day he moves in"
cqkacn,"NAH IF you leave the fact that ‘you pay for the food’ out of it. It’s one thing to say ‘hey, it would make me really happy if you cooked dinner for both of us sometimes, would you consider that?’ and another entirely to say ‘I make more money than you so you owe me a hot dinner when I get home, woman’. You’re married, your resources are shared, don’t pull that shit."
cqkc1p,[deleted]
cqkc7z,"YTA. It’s annoying to have your mom hassle you, but you are only hurting yourself. 

Set up your damn 401k, ya dramatic dummy."
cqkgly,NTA. She wants to get married on her 18th birthday? You can go to her second wedding in a few years when she’s a little more grown & not dating someone who groomed a child.
cqkkuq,"ESH. This setup is so weird. You're his wife, but you're acting like his mother.

He needs to grow up and get a better grip on finances."
cqkmhx,"Okay, we need to start talking about terminology here. 

When you say Out, I think exposing sexuality to others. So that's not out, let's call it what it is. 

You basically embarassed your very abusive sister. And honestly I think this is NTA kind of move. It's not the first time a sister has shown two different ways of acting when they get home or when they are in the outside world. Hell, my father even acts differently. A strict parent in the house but cool dad in the streets."
cqkmpj,"NAH

But you're a bit of a wet blanket. I've been to dry weddings. It's fine. But they tend to end early and everyone just kind of heads home."
cqkno8,NTA. It’s a shared hallway and they don’t have the right to leave their shit there.
cqkoga,"NTA. Equal rent, no one gets to make hours for the other. Him sleeping past noon just because is not a valid reason, especially vs you working nights."
cqkonv,"NTA for questioning the integrity, but YTA for 

> I ended with a jab comparing her expectations with having to undergo formal parliamentary hearings and stating if that is to be the new state of things I will miss our previous hr manager. The previous HR Manager was notoriously incompetent."
cqkudn,Yta. She should get the same help you got regardless of if she had a job or not and it’s not your place to jump in. Unlike you she has the balls to work and go to school and it’s the least your parent could do is be fair and help her like they helped you.
cqkuq9,"Nope NTA. Your safety comes first. Put that baby up for adoption without a second thought to the man who paid you to have sex with him. You don’t owe him anything. He was not your partner or boyfriend. You were not in a relationship with this man. 

Adoption is a wonderful gift to give a family. If this is a choice you are making freely, move forward with a mind clear of guilt. 💕"
cqkvu7,"NTA

They’re asking you for thousands if dollars. You don’t have to give it to them. Just RSVP no, or say you aren’t going if it comes up."
cql16z,No they didnt pay for it. Change the password and delete it. NTA
cql6jv,NAH. You’re not the one doing the hiring so it’s not like you’d be choosing one over the other. You’ve giving them both an equal shot and there’s nothing wrong with that.
cql6w1,"NTA, why is going and buying a watch such a big deal that the whole family has to attend? Sure it can be a big and special purchase, but I'd never assume that there was an expectation on family members to make themselves available."
cql7dw,NTA. A friend who must always have what you have is exhausting. And dangerous.
cql7g4,I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask a guest in your house to not sleep in your bed. I would maybe try to get like a blow up mattress or just a bunch of blankets to put in the ground though
cql94p,"NTA

Honestly this is pretty concerning behavior. She hasn’t seen this guy in 7 years and doesn’t even know him? Yikes."
cql9hy,"NTA. 

I get that she is going through a rough situation, breakups can leave you deep in shit but this is way too much. 
The supoort and help she needs right now is not that of a friend but a therapist. 

You don't deserve to carry such a responsibility."
cql9kh,NTA - It sounds like they have been told once and it's not your responsibility to manage the planning of their wedding. It's sort of a grey area since you know it's going to be a mess but I don't think minding your own business is an asshole move.
cql9lz,"Absolutely NTA. Safety is so very important. It doesn’t sound as if you have been rude to your MIL at all. 

I’m surprised your husband isn’t supportive. Accusing you of making a fuss when you are protecting your children is not fair at all."
cqlauy,"NAH. A lesson I learnt pretty early on is that when my wife complains about anything, she doesn't want me to solve the problem, she just wants me to listen. I think generally it is a man/woman divide. It comes naturally to us guys to try and solve problems and I think for women it's a bit more natural to listen and offer emotional support. Obviously this a huge generalisation so apologies if this comes across as sexist but it is just my personal experience."
cqlbf9,NTA. She's being a bitch.
cqld4j,This is a tough one but I’m going with NTA. She rebelled and paid a price... hopefully she also learned her friends are aholes for pressuring her. If you make 80% of the income that’s a pretty big deal and completely understand why you couldn’t leave BUT I would have called her an Uber.
cqlddw,"So this is a weird one, but I'm leaning a bit into ESH, though if how you describe it your actions are petty, but justified.

So they're clearly dicks right? They could have just dumped you before break because then you would have had plenty of time to come up with a new plan. The way its described you really weren't a major focus of the group and you even admit they basically use none of your ideas. Whether or not your ideas are ""better"" is kind of irrelevant if the group decides not to use them. That being said it doesnt really matter either because you were actively participating, weren't actively sabotaging it, and mostly just had disagreements about how to proceed, not that you weren't trying to proceed. So yeah, they're dicks.

You though? You're upset, understandably so, but you're also being petty. You directly state you dont want the project which means you're just doing this to spite them. That's a dick move. Justifiable in this case given what you've said, but still a dick move."
cqldq9,"YTA

She was obviously hesitant to even let you read it. But then she trusted you and wanted to share it with you. instead of sharing this with her you shut her out because it’s not what you would prefer and criticized her. even though she asked you still could have asked why it was written that way instead if saying it was wrong. she put herself out there and you hit her when vulnerable"
cqlf0x,YTA but very low-key in that you should have quickly responded to his text to reaffirm that you weren't coming instead of refusing to talk to him. But you're not TA for not going to see him.
cqlf4f,"“Who do you think the father, in serious emotional pain is supposed to talk to in the first place?”

A *therapist*. A grown adult in a neutral standing. *Not* his teenage daughter."
cqlfha,"NAH. I'm blood-related to all of my distant relatives, and I still don't feel any connection to them. Blood relation has nothing to do with it. If they aren't important to you, then they aren't important. Simple as that."
cqlmz6,"YTA It’s her friend’s house, therefore her responsibility. Just because you trust your friend doesn’t mean your friend should trust the new girl. Even though nothing has happened, yet."
cqlq1w,"NTA obviously. Even if she was flaky/bitchy bc of her aunts death that doesn’t mean that you have to tolerate it. Sure, maybe it would’ve been kind to see if anything else could be done but it’s not your responsibility"
cqlqqm,"ESH

1. You wife should just do it right and stop being lazy about it
2. Notes are passive aggressive as fuck
3. If company came over would you want them to see you left these instructions for your wife?
4. Both you and your wifes communication skills suck"
cqlr6s,"YTA unfortunately. She would 100% find out. I wouldn’t be paying that $200 for her wedding, though. Not when you can just do your own."
cqls5b,"NTA. 

And this is a lesson your daughter needs to learn NOW. This isn't a ""I took 31 minutes on my 30 minute lunch break"" policy. This breaks large scale policies and privacy laws. She needs to understand that f*cked up big-time and has to accept the consequences. What's next? Cute guy walks in and she wants to see if he can afford to take her to dinner?"
cqltb7,"NTA  
  
Tell your parents that you want to start a babysitting and housesitting business.  Make cards.  Devise pay rates.  Make fliers.  Give one to your uncle and tell him the rates are double for unannounced drop-offs."
cqlu79,"NTA, and girl, help your mom cut the umbilical cord and don't pick the phone up the whole time either. This is infantilising behaviour. 

What's going to happen when you settle down with someone, maybe have kids... Is she going to be at your door at all hours everyday? Set boundaries for your private life NOW before it is too late."
cqluy6,"Definitely NTA, especially if you’re the one making the money but even if you weren’t. You’re married, the money is both of yours, and if you don’t want to give away a huge portion of it (especially given that you’re not particularly rich) then you absolutely shouldn’t"
cqm0ln,"YTA (if you do this) 
Your partner, based on your info here, quite likely needs therapy to deal with her broken family and upbringing. 

Involving yourself in some dick measuring contest with what seems to be a toxic person or more will achieve absolutely nothing"
cqm2hf,"ESH
No one forced you to do these things; you could have said no. 
She sounds like a shitty friend who was happy to use you when she could.

You’ll probably both be happier not being friends."
cqm4c9,"YTA for skipping the interview. i think youd be incredibly naive to pass up the scholarship opportunity. but at the same time, it's clear this guy meant a lot to you--but I also feel like you can pay respects afterwards. im sorry for your loss and i know it's a tough decision, but if i were you, id be kicking myself forever for not taking the scholarship interview."
cqm5md,"> I need you to not insult the people I care about.” **I repeated this phrase 4 times—the first 2 times seemed to go alright.**... she also said that she’d already apologized

YTA. Good lord, four times! Why on earth did you keep bringing it up and repeating yourself even after, by your own admission, you and your mum had a productive conversation about her behaviour!? And she's right. She already apologised to you, more than once it seems. Exactly what else did you want from her? Big surprise, but you continuing to feel bad about your mum's behaviour doesn't entitle you to having your mother grovel at your feet.

She apologised the day after the event. She listened to you when you came to her a week later. She agreed to be engaged in a conversation with you about this. She apologised again. And then you kept going on at her. How exactly did you expect her to feel, and what more did you want? How many apologies do you think your mum needs to give you?"
cqm62j,"NTA. she should have the decency not to speak about her child's father that way. she can have her opinions in private, but the guy is still your DAD. nothing will change that. you obviously want love and support from both of them, and it's rude of her to just crap on your dad like that."
cqmd7k,"NTA. grad parties really arent that big of a deal. you can just get her a gift or whatever. plus youll see her for the rest of the time before she goes to school/work. the band clearly means a lot to you. you finally got the chance to see them, youre right for taking it."
cqmdfm,"Damn I am so sorry for you to be in this situation. In no way, shape or form are you the asshole. You are in a crappy situation and I can see both your perspective and your husbands. Your mom needs help and even though she has been horrible to you, you are being the amazing daughter in trying to support her. How much of her mental health issues have been caused by the tumor do you think? If the answer is most of them: then I say do what you can to fully support your mom. However, if the tumor isn’t affecting her that way then I would recommend to set some firm limits with her about how you and your husband expect to be treated is she continues staying with you. NAH"
cqmr74,"NTA - Be a douchy fuck, get treated like a douchy fuck. Cheating is shitty, tell her and do it sooner rather then later."
cqmrvs,"NTA 

Managers in such ""high-turnover"" jobs have to calculate with people suddenly resigning from the job (or even not showing up at all). As long as there is no contractual agreement between them and you about a warning time before resigning, you are fine. 

I think your managers took you for granted and simply put more and more work on you because they either were incapable to find another person for one of the jobs or because they were greedy and wanted to save the costs. Now they can see how to cope with the consequences of their own mistakes."
cqmu6v,YTA. Respect your partner enough to put in the effort to go along and make the minimal effort to be polite and pleasant.
cqmydd,"Even though I think NTA, you're unfortunately now aware of his wish. Why don't you tell them about the dress and see what they say? He'll hopefully get a grip and drop the nonsense, the chances are high that others will wear green since he's been so shit at communicating this ""day-ruining"" eventuality."
cqn0y3,NTA moving is very expensive. Also does this also mean she is going to stop going to university because he is in that area -going on the fact you said you live close to uni- you cant change your whole life every time a bad memory moves down the block.
cqn3ct,"NTA if you're under eighteen, it's not your responsibility to help with bills, etc. You should deposit the money on an account she has no access to or just buy you phone quietly."
cqn5a7,NTA. tell her you're turning your phone off for the remainder of your holiday and she will be the first person you call when you get back.
cqn8jf,YWBTA but fully endorsed and justified in your assholishness. Go be that asshole.
cqnco1,"NTA
I dont see why you would be the one driving the wedge, isnt his mother doing the same thing?

Ofc it is possible that living together would be OK after you got used to each others ways but also maybe not.

Gotta say I would love to live with a meticulous cleaner and having a MiL on tap will be useful when you have children."
cqnffa,"NTA
ya, of course you got a personal advantage. But one that compromised her in no way.

Are we missing something? Sounds like you have a weird relationship"

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
cqnw1a,"NTA. Your ""friend"" shouldn't be using you as his emotional dumping ground, I'm sorry you were put through this but it's time to say goodbye and cut him out. He only used you to make himself feel better which can strain your emotional state"
cqnw3m,"YTA. I agree that he should have measured the table, but I still think as the error was yours originally, and you didn't point out to him that you'd made a mistake before taking payment, you should have refunded the money. ""No refunds"" usually means ""no refunds *unless the item is faulty or not as described*."""
cqnxzo,"NTA, I’m sorry but it’s super immature of him to totally strand and ruin your plans to see someone he hasn’t seen out of pure laziness. If it wasn’t important for him to see Jacob before, why’s it so important now? Also even if he really wanted to see Jacob, he should want to ensure you get home safely first too."
cqo2cv,"NTA, because you did slow down after all. From your description it sounds like you slowed down to a speed that felt safe. 

Although, if no one was behind you I guess you could have slowed down more to make the situation even safer. I still do not think you are an asshole. 

The other driver is a bit of an asshole for road rage. But at the same time, the situation might have felt different to him. If he felt unsafe, then maybe he is not an asshole either."
cqo3wh,"ESH. Let it go, dude."
cqo8uw,"YTA. She sounds unpleasant, but you have no right to question anyone about a miscarriage, let alone ask for proof it happened.

>Frankly I do not care...I don’t have time for this!!

Then stop pretending she's your ""best friend"" and move on."
cqo9oo,"NTA - the thing I am learning most from this reddit is that a lot of guys seem to have a lot of problems with the women they claim to love actually eating. He ambushed you with the extra people on the night out and then took you to a place where you could not eat anything AND then none of them thought you getting somethign to eat was an issue?

I would say you are really tolerant, I would have simply driven home without him.

Just a suggestion but for some time I have had difficulty eating out becuase of various intolerances and I have learned to ask whether the place I am at can make something I can eat (egg and chips works for me). If they can't the people I am with are always happy to relocate to eat where I can eat also."
cqokrq,[deleted]
cqoksq,I wouldn't go as far as to say YTA because you are driving in a condition where you think is safest for yourself and the people around you. However there is laws against driving too slow and impeding traffic if you are constantly driving where there's a long line of cars behind you maybe you could try alternative routes that aren't as busy?
cqomyq,NTA. You had tried other methods. And as long as you spoke to her afterwards and explained why you did it.
cqori6,NTA - She swapped Instagram pages with you and she has her photos viewable to you.. THAT is consent. Really weird reaction on her part.
cqoslj,NTA. this whole situation is ridiculous. Why is he still friends with her when he knows it’s upsetting you and she’s being incredibly inappropriate? Sending the naked pictures was way out of line and if I were you I’d be suspicious about their relationship tbh something is not right there.
cqotg2,"Wait, so a home cooked dinner for 5 people with 2 courses allegedly cost $375 to make?  $75 per person?  That's nuts and tbh I don't believe it for a second.  Sounds like they're trying to take advantage imo.  NTA."
cqoz4o,NTA. Being the bigger person doesn’t mean going back to being friends with an abusive person. It means not causing further issues and leaving it alone. You aren’t friends anymore. You aren’t obligated to keep up with her health any more than you are a stranger you pass on the street.
cqp051,"""i gave the wrong address when i ordered and now that shipping is screwed i want my money back""

YTA."
cqp45p,"YTA. Aren't people who worked in submarines more prone to claustrophobia? I feel like you are basing this off of speculation and misjudgments. Maybe he was trying to commit fraud, but he didn't. I can understand pursuing him if he actually got away with it, but this just seems like a personal vendetta."
cqp9tn,"NAH, but give her some lead time to find alternate dogcare arrangements. I'm not going to call her TA because there is no indication you have previously expressed unease with the situation, she hasn't not paid you back, and dogsitting is in some people's conception of neighborliness."
cqpdrb,"NAH.   They have no way of knowing whether you smoke or not, and even smokers don't smoke all the time.   If they wanted to smoke under the gazebo, they'd just do it.   Worry not, gazebo-sharer."
cqper1,NTA. It’s a good thing to raise your son not to see nudity as something shameful or taboo and you’re extra not an asshole because you’re respecting your ex’s wishes even though you don’t agree with them.
cqphc0,"NAH      


Neither of you are assholes, you just need to communicate better."
cqplqg,"YTA

You wanted to act like a mature grown up and now you're being treated like a mature grown up you start whining."
cqpsdk,YTA. He’s working his ass off just as much as you are. He has a family he goes to see and still works 40-hour weeks. Good man! Your insensitive jab was unwarranted and makes you seem like a huge asshole.
cqpsj0,"NTA You were just trying to keep everyone safe and apologized when you realized it was a misunderstanding. The single mom should’ve accepted the apology and moved on, not threaten legal action over something like this."
cqpty6,Info: Are you paying rent?
cqpyzu,"This is a bit of an opinion one.  I think YTA because it's an hour and a half.  You can't sit up for an hour and a half?  Those short haul flights are usually very small anyway, once the seat in front is reclined you have NO space and it sounds like he was trying to work.  Long haul or night flights by all means recline that baby as far back as it goes but for such a short space of time YTA."
cqq22w,"NTA . She's being childish. She should have just told her boyfriend in the first place. The reason he thought she was lying is because she wasn't up front and honest to begin with.  All of this is on her.  She's being immature and you seem to be handling it like a decent, grown man. It's ridiculous to me that she thinks she can ban you from a concert just because she used to bang you...."
cqq3d0,"ESH - she shouldn't have asked a question that she didn't want answered honestly and you should have \*maybe\* been a little bit more delicate in your response, weight/body image is a touchy subject for most people"
cqq4qs,"So it was ok for you to do it, but not for him? Dude. Cover for your brother. He's simply following the path you laid, as all teenagers do. 


Edit: YTA. But I understand your concern."
cqq7xk,NTA. They are taking advantage of you and profiting from it. Don’t let small businesses fool you. They need to be creating an infrastructure you’re integral to but also one that’s not dependent on you or any one person. This is on them. Give them notice and from there the ball is in their court because remember it’s their business.
cqq8vt,[deleted]
cqqbf9,"NTA - she isn't taking your wedding seriously, you can whoever you want in your wedding party"
cqqdv3,"**NAH**, assuming that while O is not on the lease she is paying rent in some way. O wants her own space, you already had plans for that space. You guys need to work out a compromise as a household as to what spaces are for everybody and what spaces or for people alone. If she's not on the lease and isn't paying rent, what you and A say goes as far as I'm concerned."
cqqi59,"NTA. It’s true, you are in a rush, so what? Getting up a few minutes before is much better than pushing past and elbowing people to get off the bus. Ignore those people!"
cqqj56,Wow YTA. He did you a favor AND has to pay for it? You won’t pay because “the food wasn’t necessary” yet you were the one to guilt trip him into it? How can you even be in the right in the slightest here...
cqqj6o,"NAH, you can get married however you want, whether that’s totally secret, a big blowout wedding, or the way you’ve done it. However, you also need to be understanding that people will be upset if you do something like this because they’ll feel left out and there are expectations around wedding celebrations."
cqql9t,NTA people need to stop being negative over petty things.
cqqm9o,"From your description, I think it would be the asshole thing to do to *not* euthanize the poor animal.  :(  

Which sucks.   

NAH, except for those fucking tumors.   T\_T"
cqqp9m,YTA - don't be a petty snitch. You KNOW you're just being spiteful
cqqpi3,"NAH 
The FIL should be able to understand the significance of this tradition to you provided that you talk about it to him. I would offer to go fishing with him some time in the future though as a sign of good will."
cqqqvh,My mum used to choose the hideous school shoes for me and I was always so embarrassed. She would pick what she wanted and I got bullied for it lol. If you were 6 fair enough but at 16 you should be able to choose yourself
cqqt0c,"NAH. You have to do what you're comfortable with.

That said, you might really benefit from having a warm and loving family in your life, so maybe you can take steps towards being more a part of the family, over time."
cqqt8x,"NTA

You all sound incredibly immature, but yes, you're justified in stepping away from this friendship"
cqqvi6,"YTA So, you're going to cut off contact with your niece because you want more contact? That's not going to get you what you want, especially with a teenager. All or nothing approaches like that usually lead to the *nothing*."
cqqyu1,"> said it was a disrespect to my gf that i asked her what was her type and said that i stop talking to her.

Wait, you already have a girlfriend? Yeah, YTA just for that. Maybe you should be spending time with her instead of this girl.

And don't be touchy touchy with people. You might like it but most people don't. Especially the opposite sex. It's uncomfortable and weird"
cqr8um,"Yeah I’m voting NTA - your mum is being ridiculous in making you guys out to be the bad guys. If you can I’d seriously start thinking about moving out because it would probably help to balance your relationship with your mum. Sometimes parents can’t see that their children are capable of making decisions and being independent so they continue to treat them as kids. 
Don’t fret over what happened though, honestly you guys did nothing wrong and you tried to accommodate numerous times."
cqr9ve,YTA. It was literally your fault that you weren't there to sign in and you're cussing out a receptionist for following procedure? How is that normal?
cqr9yq,">They told me, and I quote, “Well you don’t have to pick up if you don’t know the number.” 

You've already been told you're not the receptionist. Stop answering it.

YTA for making this whole situation a thing. Just ignore the phone if it's not for you."
cqrdd2,"NTA. If your parents don't trust you to spend the money in a way that they approve of, they shouldn't give you the money."
cqre01,"NTA. There is a word for this behavior. That word is ""stealing."""
cqrf00,NTA. Your father is a big enough jerk to spend the money he was saving up to buy his wife something nice? Screw that guy. It's not your fault that your dad has a problem.
cqrf3g,"YTA. Your boss clearly told you this in confidence, and if she's treating your friend in such a way that your friend can't figure out on her own that the boss doesn't like her I don't think there is reason to violate that confidence. If you think she's actually in danger of getting fired from this job she uprooted her family to take, it'd be one thing, but other than that I think you should respect the relationship you have with your soon-to-be-ex boss."
cqrgom,"I won’t give you a judgement, but if this ends up being the last opportunity to see him and you don’t take it, can you live with that decision for the rest of your life? That’s the only question you really need to ask yourself. And even if your answer is “yes” that’s a perfectly fine answer too."
cqriwr,"NTA. How could you possibly know if she was in an open relationship or not? Also, 9 times out of 10, when someone gets caught cheating, they say they’re in an open relationship to try to save their ass. Given that she hasn’t spoken to you in a few days, I guarantee she’s lying and is scared that you’ll question her further. Go to her fiancé and tell him what you saw. If he says they’re in an open relationship, so be it. But I’d bet money that they aren’t in an open relationship, and she was cheating on him."
cqrj7z,"NAH-my son has sensory processing disorder and certain textures make him vomit almost immediately. So we don’t make him eat things like squash. (Yet) That being said, occupational therapy has made a huge difference, and I do push my son to eat new things all the time.  He can now eat foods with nuts and not vomit. He can eat leaves and be fine.   The last thing we want for him is to only eat chicken nuggets and Mac and cheese for the rest of his life because there is so much to experience with food.  He want him to be able to eat a healthy, varied diet.  

It’s understandable that you don’t want to eat those things, but if you have had therapy for them then the best thing you can do for yourself is branch out and try new things.  Maybe think about things you like about it, reevaluate if you’ve judged it too harshly, and see if you’ve made any gains from a sensory perspective.

Out of curiosity, is this dish significant to your dad?  Is it cultural?"
cqrl3n,"NTA, you were in a weird spot and did the best with it."
cqrq3a,"NAH. 

You have a very platonic relationship with a guy and you feel comfortably sharing a room with him. (I assume two separate beds). 

Your boyfriend is in a relatively new relationship and a month into it his girlfriend flies to New Orleans and shares a room with a guy. New Orleans has a reputation. I’m sure he’s just worried and he’s not expressing it well. 

He WBTA if it’s not discussed calmly and with both sides understanding where the other comes from and him still not being comfortable with this vacation."
cqrqz6,"NTA. Wtf were you supposed to do? You offered, she declined and then turns the whole thing on you. Seems like she is toxic. She blames you and then has the audacity to bring your mental health into it. She’s TA in a major way."
cqrxn7,"NTA . You need to be less passive about this. If you are in the toilet and she is telling you to hurry up, take your time and explain that she should have gone a few minutes ago instead of making everyone rush ."
cqrzml,"NTA. If he's getting shitty with you, then you're allowed to ask him to leave. Although I don't really understand how him fighting with people on the internet affects you in any way."
cqs3y4,"NAH. By not telling her you will be able to take any related symptoms seriously. If you tell her, psychosomatic symptoms (or simple drama) might make it hard to tell if anything is actually wrong. At the first sign of a symptom, you can suggest that there might have been something wrong with something she ate. 

You tried to tell her, but you were too late. Unless you're planning on helping her puke it up, there's nothing to be done.

Edit: I did it, Mom! I'm a Partassipant!!"
cqs4hn,"Yes, obviously a tablet or phone is ""way different"" from an xbox but they are all expensive gifts of the same level. It's not like OP got an xbox and his brothers got clothes and a wristwatch. For all we know they specifically asked for a phone and tablet."
cqs61b,"NTA - you are absolutely free to say you're not comfortable with a big old party, and your mother's emotional manipulation doesn't make you the bad guy."
cqsaoa,NTA - You're an adult and should make decisions based on what's best for you.
cqsbtr,How have you gotten mixed opinions about this?  You're clearly NTA for cutting your grass while people happen to walk by.
cqscmg,"YTA. Your job is to repair the equipment. So do your job and repair the equipment.

No one's learning from this. The stores just going to begrudgingly spend more money, and eventually the companies might even question why they hire you in the first place."
cqscwb,"NAH, your dad is an asshole and your sister was raised by an asshole. Understand that as reduculous you think your dad is, some of the stuff he preaches inevitably ends up in your sister"
cqsd1n,NTA. You bought the tickets and let him know that you wanted to go early and he agreed.
cqsgac,"NTA because it was a misunderstanding on your part. The guy on crutches was unnecessarily rude and aggressive. If he had simply asked for you to move seats due to his crutches, all of this would have been avoided. He also assaulted you by pushing you down the aisle wtf?"
cqsgqs,"NTA. You don't want to take care of the dog, end of story. He is going away so he has to accept it. Bob is a huge asshole though for not 'letting you out of agreeing'."
cqshqp,"NTA - Run, far and fast from this friendship. You are the only friend here, she is not even close to reciprocal. You deserve and should demand better."
cqsl6t,"NAH. You don’t have to pay him, you never said you would. Also, we don’t know that he took the money so we aren’t going to put the asshole card on him either, (unless you can confirm that he took the money) because there could have been someone that saw it first."
cqsozx,NTA. You stated your boundary clearly. I think your (minor) mistake was to accept the first drink. Becky was TA for pushing your boundary.
cqspwa,"NTA bordering on NAH. I get it, she’s dealt with A LOT from him clearly and she’s trying to protect her son from the pain of having a yo-yoing father. Maybe you can talk to her and get her to consider it a trial run, see how he acts for a few months and then make a call for her own son. 

There are some people who are horrible and don’t deserve to be around their kids because it’s more harm than good. But if he can show he has really truly changed and is not a danger to the child (mentally or physically), my bleeding heart says to give him a chance. But your decision is your own and she’s being a bit overbearing by reacting this way."
cqsqf6,"NTA: I would get in the car with the dog, drive as far away as humanly possible and drop the dog off at a no-kill shelter. Then just keep driving away from this abusive relationship."
cqsrjr,"NAH, but maybe just stop texting her and just leave the introductions and impressions to when you actually meet her. Some people just aren't texting people. Nothing wrong with calling her either though."
cqst3z,"NTA at all. You are allowed to keep your dinner intimate. 

Yes I have this same issues with friends. I stopped worrying a long time ago! As long as everyone is included along the way - no harm done."
cqsve2,NTA your wife is for even considering to let a known abuser near the kids.
cqsxpp,"My wife had a friend, years back, that I caught doing coke im my bathroom. Kicked her out on the spot (the friend, not the wife lol). Im not getting shit on my record because someone I associate with is a dumbass and ODs or something.

NTA."
cqsxt5,NTA. Have you considered cutting contact altogether? She is properly crazy
cqsy3i,"NTA, obvious validation post."
cqt22b,"NTA. They're too young to see your dad for who he is. You owe that man nothing. Eventually, they will probably come to the same conclusion you did."
cqt2bv,NAH - other than your ex. Explain to her why you were mad. You never made it clear to her that you didn't want them to hang. Sometimes things need to be clearly spelled out. Let  her know why it bothered you so much and let her explain her side as well. Seems to me like its just a misunderstanding.
cqt2rs,"NTA. He’s TA 100%, let people close their doors dude."
cqt3go,"*Husband gets tots out.*

OP: “Oh honey, I was saving those for the kids’ dinner.”

HUBBY: “Apologies, my love, I shall return them whence they came”

*Husband puts tots back*

Fixed. YTA."
cqt7my,"NTA - He is clearly the asshole, the manager officially stated that he cannot refuse other people access to the gym.
It's nice of him to start a class, but honestly if it was my break time he can go chase his yogi dreams somewhere else.
If he gave me the stinkeye again, I'd talk to the manager about this hostile work environment he is creating.
You cannot change your schedule, so that's that"
cqt8nw,"NTA your friend is ridiculous. It’s not cute to make yourself sick to “impress” a girl. She probably felt bad enough she forgot someone had a gluten intolerance, she’d have probably been double embarrassed if he ate it anyway in some show of bravado and then was horrendously ill after. Sometimes people need friends to stop them from being dumb. Good job OP"
cqt8z3,"NTA FREE THE PUPPER


...but also make sure it’s a no kill shelter."
cqta1k,"NTA 

Why are you in a relationship with the type of person who has no issue with basically robbing you of $700?

But, going forward, never loan anyone money that you can afford to lose. 

I don’t lend money to anyone. If I can afford to give it to them as a gift and I want to help them, I just give them the money they need. Otherwise, I flat out say no."
cqtahu,"NTA. Friend sounds like a dumbass. He bought y'all drinks, then started attacking you for drinking it... so you bought your own drink.

Seems reasonable to me. I wouldn't have spun the wheel either."
cqtcc9,"YWBTA if you phrased it like *that*, yes.

Here's a better way to phrase it.   Next time she says she isn't happy with her appearance/weight, say this:

*""I hate seeing you so miserable about this, and I want to help you.  What can I do to help you with your fitness goals?""*

This puts the decision in her control, and once she gives you guidelines about how to help her control her food intake and/or exercise plan, you can stick to them as firmly as you need to in order to help."
cqtd6b,This all seems totally healthy and normal. ESH
cqth4y,"NAH.

You have every right to be annoyed. Keep in mind your daughter might prefer the sleepover than spending time with you. 8 year olds are like that sometimes."
cqtj7f,NTA. Your parents sound like mine. Gave me hell but coddled my cripple of a little brother.
cqtk0i,[deleted]
cqtk1p,"**NTA** for ""WIBTA if I just ignore my work friend and don't reach out?""

This is the manner in which he engages. It's not emotionally or psychologically healthy for you. He may be a great guy most of the time, but when he's not, you don't deserve to be treated poorly. His mental health is his own business until he requests help from you. You're only responsible for your own well-being.


**YTA** for ""WIBTA if I purposely act cold and distant?"" but only a little.

He may deserve being treated in such a way, but if you're acting purposefully in this manner, you're doing a disservice to him and you. You should express how this is hurting you, if you haven't done so already, in a clear, assertive manner. He needs to know that his actions are causing you pain. You want to reach out to him, but you don't want to have to play a guessing game for when his moods shift. Answering assholery with assholery is a little petty. Explain what's going on, and if he doesn't change, you may need to take a step back."
cqtnk0,"NTA - mom is okay with locking the house, then you lock the house."
cqtnyh,Absolutely NTA. And it’s pretty nervy for your father when he was the one who “left the family” when you were 14. He wants you to agree to potentially take on the responsibility of parenthood when he seems to have walked away from his pretty casually
cqtod0,"NTA - deny and blame are two things that addicts do when confronted. Congratulations to you for defeating your demons, wishing you the best."
cqtpwa,NTA. You asked everyday for 6 months? They shouldn’t have strung you along. You should have let it go after them repeatedly putting it off. Find some friends from the area and have them take you out.
cqty1q,"NTA. Tell your family they have two options:

1.  They stop harassing you and you’ll execute the will to the best of your ability. 

2.  They keep harassing you and their share of the estate will be handed over to a lawyer to execute and the lawyer fees will come out of their trust."
cqty3o,"YWBTA

Although it's incredibly patronising for them to be using these kinds of parenting tactics on you, you're still living off them. If you don't like it, buy your own phone.

What you're experiencing is the same as every other teenager/young adult who lives at home. 9 times out of ten moving out resolves these issues and you actually start to like/get on with them again.

Cutting off all ties is an overreaction I think. Once you've moved out and have your own space you'll be ok."
cqtywd,"NTA - I don't think anyone here is a major A, but I do see 2 separate issues. #1 is that it kinda seems to me like the amount of times the bf calls is kind of ridiculous. I'm in a semi-LDR (college) and when my gf and I are apart either one of us would go crazy if the other called that much. But as far as your issue goes, I believe that you are not in the wrong for wanting the limited time that you have to not be interrupted so often"
cqtzgg,"I’ll tell you what, this is exactly what just happened to me while I was living in Nashville. I was by myself and the people above me were just absolute shits. I honestly was afraid to have friends over because they would literally stomp on the floor at our normal conversation levels. I just complied and stayed pleasant all the way until the last month I was there. I knew I was moving back, and I had been nothing but reasonable with them, so I really didn’t care and pretty much made sure to make a racket. I’m sure we’re both assholes in this situation, but honestly, fuck em."
cqufwz,"YTA. You already made a commitment to drive your wife and to support her. She's right that this is about more than just the car ride itself, and moral support is very important. ""Just try again"" is a ridiculous attitude to have to the possibility of her failing a significant test in her career. Not to mention that you are trying to miss supporting her over something so silly as a bachelor party. Just tell your cousin honestly why you can't make it, and if your cousin doesn't understand, he's TA, too."
cqugh7,"YTA

Title should have been ""AITA for wanting my best friend to dump her boyfriend for me,"" which makes you TA"
cquixx,"So you decided to argue about it, even if you don't really mind it and would do it? 

Then why argue?"
cquk6w,"NTA you were polite at first and said that you weren’t interested, if someone can’t take no for an answer then they also need to grow a thicker skin for this type of job.

To be fair, I usually just say ‘not interested’ and close the door in their face (or just don’t answer to begin with). So I think you have the patience of a saint in comparison to me lol"
cqukey,YTA. People move on and he’s trying to better his education. He is still trying to stay in touch with you hence the text so your action are gonna push him away even more.
cqukzv,"NAH, but you're choosing to make this harder than it needs to be.

Step 1- eat the food

Step 2- clean your jar

You already do both of those things.

Step 3- Take it back to your desk or otherwise put it away.

You only have a problem because you aren't choosing the easy solution."
cquocu,"NAH

You did the right thing, it's your business alone who you sleep or have slept with.

As regards to him...perfectly normal reaction considering the situation, he just needs some space.

Why she told him? Who knows, however that's her right to.

Stay out of it and give them space, he'll reach out when ready."
cquu09,"NTA. Some guy convinced her to sleep with him? Don’t sugar coat it. She chose to sleep with a man other than her husband. She cheated on him. Having sex with someone else when you’re in a relationship is not only wrong, but it sets a horrible example for the children... was she even thinking of them? 

I can understand why her husband was talking smack about her to the kids; I would too."

cqv4f5,"If you subscribe to a consequentialist view of morality, then judgement should be based on the outcome of an action. In this case, I'm struggling to see any positive consequence of telling your brother, but can imagine plenty of negative ones. As you say, it's not really your place to be spreading this, so I think YTA if you do."
cqv60h,"That's just a comfortable way of evading an uncomfortable discussion about someone's hygiene. That can only work for so long before it becomes an infantilizing and Pavlovian way of getting your partner to clean themselves.

An emotionally healthy adult partner shouldn't be treated like an emotionally damaged child."
cqv85z,You’re kind of overreacting. Just wash the sheets. It’s her house. YTA.
cqva10,That dude seems like an emotionally manipulative asshole. You were right in what you said. His reaction to setting boundaries shows he is a manipulator. NTA
cqvbtz,"NAH 

Although, I don't think it's appropriate to ask for a discount when another stylist cut your hair. You have an ""agreement"" (really more of a privilege) with your friends Mom, but that doesn't carry over to all haircuts at the salon. I think you should have said thank you and chose to wait to be taken care of by your friends Mom. Now you'll know for the future!"
cqvgi4,NTA. Tell her to tell your dad to not volunteer and have the BBQ on Friday. Why is his obligation more important than yours.  You both see it as important. Better yet bring your D&D friends to the BBQ stay a bit and than play.
cqvhec,"Look, I know you're trying to protect your brother, but at the end of the day what you're doing is very controlling. You may think you're saving your family drama, but you're just making your brother resentful. If he's not ready to stop being friends with this bad friend, you can't make him stop. He will stop when he's ready. Let him get there on his own. 

NAH"
cqvim1,"NTA. She isnt just your BIL's ex, she's your longtime friend. You and your husband are supporting your friend and there is nothing wrong with that. Phil isnt necessarily TA either because he is logically upset and emotional right after the break up. The only asshole I see here is your MIL for interfering and making things worse."
cqvjik,"NTA. Even if your rats were chill, I'd be nervous about letting a rat around a bunch of 8 year olds, because a lot of them have probably never thought of a rat as a pet and might freak out because they just don't know any better. I'd be worried for my rat's safety. Because I am a paranoid person like that."
cqvndo,"I wish more ladies would realize its better to be single than to be with a douche. You don't need to have a boyfriend to have value.

cqvsd1,"NTA you checked, they said they are ok.  Go de stress and relax for a bit."
cqvw8r,"YTA sorry mate but if it's common knowledge to knock on the door for the reasons you stated, then yes you should knock the door. Someone may or may not forget to lock it. Is it really such a big deal to knock the door??"
cqvzja,"YTA if you're actually friends. I mean, M has no control over C and never made a move so it's fine that you're dating, but you should have talked to him about it before or right after you told C you liked her.

However it is not clear if you're close to M since you're ""not sure what happened between the two of them"" and can't just ask. If you're not close no harm no foul."
cqw0ur,"As a former McDonalds employee, ESH. You suck for being so sensitive and she sucks for getting in your space. Its difficult because you have to clean the entire lobby - no exceptions. But you also don't want to get in people's way. 

Now, you are a bit of a dick when it comes to the leaving your garbage part. I hate that."
cqw1uo,"NTA you were just trying to help him understand reality. Although I’m not sure what your end goal is, to get him to change maybe?

I’m no psych but he seems like he could be either a total narcissist or so insecure he has no way of coping other than to act like a total jerk. Sometimes it’s hard to tell."
cqw3qd,"NTA. Refusing to at least pitch in for some of the food that he basically took for himself is a pretty dick move, especially considering it shouldn't be that hard of a courtesy to not eat the whole box of cereal."
cqw54l,"YTA - It is important that your son bonds with his social group. You are putting your discomfort before his wellbeing. 
I completely understand discomfort in social situations especially when you dont know anyone but that happens at the start of the school year. You will be fine - you will probably even enjoy it."
cqw60s,"YTA, albeit a mild one, because you know her last name has been a subject of contention within the family. It's not an appropriate thing to bring up at a wedding. If I were your half-sister I'd have happily taken my partner's name just to end that foolish squabble as well."
cqw714,NTA. Good job for standing up for yourself. next time she comes by expect a payment upfront or don't allow the child to stay.
cqwa78,"NTA. An Irishman here, you're right that the death toll for the troubles was around 3,500. However, he may have been including the death toll of the whole region and the history leading up to it. The Troubles is generally considered to be the period from 1960s - 1998, but conflicts between Catholics and Protestant have been going on in that region and all of Ireland for hundreds of years. He may have just been a little drunk and was talking about the entirety of the Irish - British conflict in the north as opposed to just that short period."
cqwb7x,"NTA. You asked if they had anything planned and were told no. That makes you extra courteous if anything. While it is weird that the party is on someone else's birthday, sometimes that happens when so many people have birthdays in the same month. I wouldn't cancel anything and if anyone raises a stink, tell them that you had asked prior to booking so they shouldn't have any problems with it."
cqwc96,YTA unless you have apologized to your dog.
cqwfu9,YTA on the grounds that you clearly did this without considering the effect on or asking the permission of the person whose feelings matter most: your friend.
cqwfue,"NTA. What he did is IMO, unforgivable. He’s an AH for “helping you through it” while knowing full well he was the other dude. What a pos."
cqwh5x,"ESH: you both sound Terrible. Your mental health doesn’t excuse you being a dick to your friend and giving such short notice or jumping in and out of living with her. That’s trash behaviour and you don’t get to hide behind ill health for your trash behaviour.

Furthermore, her ill health and your ill health doesn’t justify living in filth and neglecting two kittens.

Both of you are very much the assholes and you’re more the asshole than her, as I believe your jumping in and out of the house, has probably affected her mental health.

You both need to start taking responsibility for your own wellbeing and stop excusing your own toxic behaviours due to mental ill-health. It’s this kinda shit that gets people with mental health problems, a bad name. You don’t lose culpability and responsibility, just because you’re ill."
cqwjci,"NTA 

Boyfriend- grow up and use your words if you need help. Ask for her help rather than getting frustrated. Calling her controlling for laughing at your mistake is way too far, especially after she cleaned it up after you. Big difference between making fun of someone's accent and their facial expressions and laughing when someone makes a mess"
cqwo8h,NTA she is also capable of going to the library and using one of their computers. She can also save her money and buy her own laptop.
cqwomg,"Oof. I’m going to go NAH.

It’s her house, so she has final say. You are doing your best, and your concerns are legitimate.

Do you need all of your belongings? Is it plausible to sell off a few items and buy back new items to replace once you’re on your own feet again?

I would suggest external storage units, but I hear most of them are not well-maintained..."
cqwp33,"NTA. You are being exploited, honestly."
cqwpve,"NAH - I have a golden retriever (almost 1 year old) and I live in NYC.

My gf and I started brushing her coat with a Furminator because she's been shedding like a demon.

My gf did it once without me (first time) and said there was a ton of hair on the street. The 2nd time, I saw it and was mortified by how much hair my dog was shedding. The 3rd time i insisted we collect at least some of the hair in a plastic bag. I tried googling the topic to see if it was littering but couldn't find anything on it. But i felt bad seeing all the hair fly into traffic.

Personally, I think if you go out of your way to go to public parks, then you're NTA. If the other guy can't control his animals to not go play with the hair, that's sort of on him. But conversely, i fully sympathize with him on how horrifying it can be to see the sheer amount of hair flying everywhere."
cqwqw7,"YTA. Family said they didn't like it and you still went on with it. Also it's creepy how you refer to this missing woman. ""Beautiful young girl."" She was a 20 year old woman."
cqwtbd,NTA - sometimes you gotta just have a you day. I do this occasionally and have never felt bad about it.
cqx0kq,"NTA. Sometimes you can’t help but feel a little weird in these situations and I think it’s better to have an honest conversation with your SO. Maybe not for every little thing..they’re still free to have friends and talk about stuff...but honestly, he should take your concerns seriously and be more conscious when it comes to convos with a girl who probably has feelings for him."
cqx3tk,"YTA. You are the adult. YOU made the commitment to these dogs. You don't just get rid of them when they're no longer convenient for you. If they're shitting and pissing in the house, TRAIN THEM. And feel free to institute consequences for the kids, while you're at it, but these dogs are inherently your responsibility."
cqx500,"ESH man. He’s an asshole for being a bully but you’re also being whack for not choosing a side. If your group collectively kicked him out, what’s the point in trying to make amends after finding out he’s throwing a party? Or using his *party* as a way to work things out? Sounded like you wanted an invite tbh. Try again if you really want to save your relationship with him"
cqx72b,What an odd situation. You don’t owe anything to your girlfriend’s sister. You can tell your girlfriend “hey I don’t even really like kickball but I appreciate the invite” and your girlfriend should be okay with it. Your girlfriend shouldn’t play kickball if she’s worried about getting hit in the nose.
cqx8ba,YTA because of how you worded this. You both have a right to the shared space but you seem to think that because at one point he didn’t use it that you have more of a right to it now. If his car fits in the lines for the spot then y’all have to work this out like adults and you should drop the attitude that he has to be the one to move.
cqxagu,"If people don't want your dog on their property, it's their property.  The pooping has nothing to do with it.

NAH - just keep your dog off of their property. It's theirs. You didn't know before but now you do."
cqxbp0,"NTA. Once you’re out of the honeymoon period, no more airport pickups. That’s the rule.

But also he’s a whiny child for doing it to you and then throwing a fit when you do the same thing."
cqxchb,"NTA

He's being ridiculous, why would he think you and your girlfriend wouldn't want privacy? And why should his desire to go out drinking supersede your right to said privacy?

Also, to just state it as the first message, to steamroller you into accepting, was an extra asshole cherry on top of an asshole sundae. He sucks. You're cool. Especially since you offered him to stay for one or two nights (I wouldn't have done so) that way he still gets to go out a couple of times if he wants to."
cqxe50,"YTA. You already thought she was straight, which means there's a whole universe of men she could be attracted to instead of you, but she's with you. Why does being pansexual make a difference in light of that?

Edit: Okay, your updates make this clearer, although I still don't think you should say to her that her being pansexual is worrisome. But it tones down the concern a lot, and you're only mildly TA. It's understandable to be concerned for her safety or well-being or for her relationship with her family. But, ultimately, whether that's an issue she'd like to address now (coming out to her family) is her choice, and expressing that you are worried about it without prompting will only make her more stressed about any coming out experience she might have. Moreover, it's not your place to be stressed or nervous on her behalf, especially if she's expressing ease."
cqxfv4,No man that’s some hard shit. She needs to fix it because that isn’t healthy
cqxg9g,"NTA. 

>telling me that I had no business telling a grown man what to do

A grown ass man should know not to touch wild animals."
cqxi1i,"YTA. Your friend was a kid and trusted her mother. She likely didn't understand the implications of what her mother was asking her to say. Your friend is a victim in this too, and you're being a bad friend by cutting her out. Also if you're angry, be an adult and talk to your friend about it."
cqxifp,"NTA.  Compromise would be asking if he wants to use the bathroom before you shower.  No one should enter the bathroom when you're naked, not even if they ask if you're behind the shower curtain first."
cqxjxi,"NTA

And, I'm thinking you dodged a bullet.

The fact that you made the very simple request to think it over on the weekend, and now she's not speaking with you, should tell you everything you need to know.

Yikes!"
cqxk83,"YTA - The world does not revolve around you. You're currently fine, and people have their own lives to live and their own plans they've commited to. You're not in the hospital facing complications, you're sitting at home. Had you asked for your friends company instead of assuming they would come to you, you wouldn't be the asshole."
cqxn8b,"NTA. Everyone knows that ticket prices can change, and she stalled.

She should be thankful."
cqxoq5,NTA. He is old enough to be called out for being a prick.
cqxs5r,"NTA

But with a person like that, I would NOT agree to get reimbursed.  Get the money up front 'cause he's established that he'll screw you out of money."
cqxu9b,NTA. If he was 5 it would be a different story. Sometimes kids need a shake up from a stranger to realize that their actions impact people beyond themselves and their immediate family.
cqxwae,"NTA

You sure that's your mother and not a judgmental asshole friend you've considered not talking ever to? 

Sheesh. Cut her off, you'll be better for it."
cqxybs,"NTA. Key cutting at Home Depot costs literally $2.00. Have done it many times. If she's charging you more than $2.00 she needs to explain exactly why, and she also needs to eat the cost difference. It's a matter of principle, you just don't buy people expensive versions of necessities and then expect them to pay for it when there was a cheaper option.  


Also she sounds like a huge asshole about the entire situation. Who on Earth takes the only key home for the summer? But what confuses me is why you all put up with it. You should have insisted that she mail the key home immediately at her expense, since she messed up by taking it and preventing everyone from getting copies and inconveniencing all of her housemates. You guys definitely need to be less wishy-washy about this. She sounds like she's crossing major lines as a housemate, and it sounds like she does this often enough that you've gotten used to it."
cqxz3n,"NTA...your mom is 1000% in the wrong, not even a 24 hour notice? That's shitty of her. My step-dad who also hates pets wouldn't even pull that on us kids of which there are 4 of us from 18 to 35."
cqxzpq,"YTA you're at work. Be professional. You could have asked the gender, but don't call guests ugly."
cqy0ey,NTA. They’re being inconsiderate jerks. You are totally within your rights to give them a deadline.
cqy1ta," NTA 

Whatever drama is going on between the parents should not continue with the children. 

My cousins and I are in a similar position, but we grew up somewhat close and hung out a lot. And our parents (sisters) argue and don’t get along very much, but my cousins and I all agree that their drama is all just stupid and immature and agree that just because they don’t get along doesn’t mean we shouldn’t either. I’d say give it a shot. Being close with your cousins is pretty neat, even outside Alabama...."
cqy26b,"Hold up.  She is CURRENTLY 17, and in December of 2017 he was 18 or 19?  Sounds pretty statutory-rapey to me.  Not to mention all of the other classic signs of an abuser.  Isolating her, controlling her via emotional blackmail.   Tread lightly, but encourage her to find her confidence and do better.  NTA."
cqy4r3,"NTA- quite frankly, a 25 year old trying to ""date"" a 17 year old is predatory- no normal 25 year old I know would think of anyone under 20 as ""dateable"", there's such a huge difference in maturity and life experiences. Your sister won't learn this until it's too late, if ever, and that's certainly not a ""lesson"" I would ever want my own 17 year old sister to undertake. She may be furious with you when/if she finds out, but this is for her own good, and protecting her trumps her liking you."
cqy5bh,"NTA.  Buy  a strap-on then.  If they want to make it uncomfortable, time to up the ante."
cqy9oo,"NTA - your mom is completely within her rights to want a photo to remember the day, but the bottom line is that you're uncomfortable with the photo being posted online, and that should be respected. End of conversation.

Is it possible to compromise: she can have the photo so that she can have the memory but not post it to Facebook?"
cqyb22,"NAH. She probably can't abandon her friend who's visiting, so she had to ask. Only way she can come, and it's reasonable to say you want to keep it small."
cqybj6,[deleted]
cqydf9,NTA. You're taking caution in a dangerous situation that could cost the lives of you and your family.
cqydtk,"YTA if you are only telling on your coworker to distract from your getting called out on being late. It sounds like his behavior is known, so what good would the conversation have?"
cqyefq,NAH - if he moves in... it’s a one bedroom... I wouldn’t be cool with some dude crashing on my couch permanently. I think you’re a champ for tolerating two months.
cqyht0,"NTA, they clearly have no respect for you. You don’t deserve that at work and especially not at your wedding."
cqyl7f,"NTA, your father used you for your money. Tell him rightly so. That was your money and he pretty much spent it via you. Father or not, you're not hos ATM."
cqymuc,"YTA because of this comment: “it’s not a big deal to him”. OF COURSE it’s not a big deal to HIM. He is the one who said it, why would he give a shit? Your WIFE and DAUGHTER cared enough to be upset and come to you and you completely dismissed them and their feelings. Even if you didn’t say something to your uncle, you could have at least cared about their feelings."
cqyqs3,"ESH. Well-intentioned, obviously, but counterproductive. Randomly beeping at someone who already isn't paying attention to the road seems like it's going to make them more distracted rather than less, not to mention it's irritating/distracting to everyone else around you."
cqyr22,YTA. Strictly because you LIED.  You threw in that last little bit about chores for nothing. You are letting them believe if they get better about chores that you’ll reconsider when you clearly spell out (to us) that you won’t. The effect of lying parents is children that don’t trust.
cqyrfz,"NTA, you had an agreement and she broke it. No deal."
cqys2j,NTA - the agreement is more than fair and there’s no way he thought the agreement was only for one month
cqysjs,"""He suggested a wheelchair""

So, your doctor suggests you use one, and you still feel like you'd be faking it? Man, YTA, but only to yourself. Living in pain all the time isnt something you should feel obligated to do, you owe yourself more than that"
cqysmb,NTA Invisible disabilities are still disabilities. Do what you need to do.
cqyuiy,NTA. It’s a dick move to date your friend’s ex but that soon after the breakup? That means she was emotionally cheating on you with your best friend while you were together and they don’t seem ashamed by it at all. Gross.
cqz0kb,"YWBTA because you're better than ""losing it."" You have clearly listed your issues here for our grand judgement, and you absolutely should do the same for her. Be clear, calm, and firm about how she's falling short and how she needs to change.

cqz3hw,Totally NTA! You gave your “friend” so many warnings so it was definitely all on her. Seems like she ruined your birthday too
cqz4o0,"NTA. My high school trips are still some of my favorite trips and since its your last year, it’s your last chance. I recommend telling your teacher how much you want to go but your dad is holding out. Depending on the teacher they are usually willing to reach out and maybe get the real reason why your dad is hesitant."
cqz5kt,"NAH. It's better to have outsider as an executor. Specially if money is not the issue. It might feel assholish to her, though."
cqz6ur,"NTA.  Pretty funny and creative punishment, albeit weird.  No worse than a time out, really."
cqz7ef,"NTA, good for you for sticking to your morals!"
cqz7vp,"YTA....but don’t reach out to him. Just...let that all die down and try not to think about that embarrassment ever again. And come on man, don’t do that with someone else in the room. Even if they’re asleep."
cqz88i,NTA - You guys made a fair deal. Your older sister shouldn't even be upset you told her the deal and she can accept it if she wants.
cqz8io,"NTA. You did it, don’t let someone else take credit for fear of being impolite!"
cqzb56,NTA you don’t owe him anything
cqzequ,"NTA. Giving *you* shit about something embarrassing, but not that big of deal, that you did is one thing, but *actively sabotaging* your chances with someone else was a really shitty thing to do. ""Playing the victim"" like *you* are in the wrong for being upset about that is a classic passive-aggressive move."
cqziof,NTA - But why are you buying a full suit when you can't afford it? Go with a rental and tell him you can't afford the other one.
cqzk6p,"NAH, it may be a little unethical but it doesn’t make you an asshole."
cqznvf,"NTA. Friends don’t milk friends for their love and sympathy. Find friends that help you be a better person, ditch people that like to use you as their ego-stroker."
cqzozx,"NTA, and unfortunately your brother’s actions may have made this snake an unsuitable pet. I recommend finding a sub that knows about snakes and asking them to weigh in on what you should do."
cqzptm,"NAH. I understand wanting to relax after work and enjoying the few hours you have to yourself, but I understand her perspective. instead of thinking that she's trying to make you work, see that she is trying to spend time with you.  She hasn't seen you all day and sees you as the highlight of her day.  I would instead use the time after that silly annoying errand to go out to eat some ice cream or walk around a park."
cr03dk,[deleted]
cr03rr,NAH but if your using your car to ferry people it's generally a good idea to check the car interior and clean up
cr06p8,NTA in any way shape or form. You need to leave the nest man and make a name for yourself. You can still visit and help your family periodically but there comes a point in life when one must take a moment to think about themselves before they can help others.
cr08wh,"NTA. She really had no right to expect different than what you’ve done previously, especially if you agreed on something prior to the day and she expressed nothing about her expectations changing."
cr0a2z,NTA if your brother also thinks it’s funny
cr0bnw,NTA Instagram is not this serious lol
cr0d5d,"NTA

yikes."
cr0gtq,"YTA, and I say this as a vegan. 

It will not help the cause of animal rights to throw away an already dead animal's pelt. It won't bring it back,  and it won't stop your daughter from wanting one. Now she needs another. Which means you've increased the demand for coyote pelts by 1. How very unhelpful to coyotes.

People are more willing to consider your view point when you consider theirs, not when you ram your views down their throat,  nor by banning/destroying their property. You sound insufferable. 

My kid is vegetarian. I've had people ask me what I'll ""do"" if he ""rebels"" and eats meat.  I tell them that if his big teenage rebellion is becoming an omnivore , then I will consider myself to have gotten off easy. Your daughter just wants herself a pelt. You find it distasteful. I find it distasteful, too. But if owning an animal pelt, bought with her own money,  is your daughter's big rebellion, then you have it easy.  There are much worse battles to have. Don't pick this hill to die on.  It's a stupid hill."
cr0i3q,NTA. Get out and never look back.
cr0le5,"NTA, you are not her photographer. Taking photos here and there is nice but she's being entitled. Tell her to buy a tripod or a selfie stick. Enjoy your time in the moment. Not behind her camera looking at her."
cr0lms,"NTA - I've got no sympathy for phone scammers. If you want to spend your time being petty, please do so."
cr0o8k,"I'm sorry but YTA. Loving gf **>**openly terrible uncle. If you had just warned her ""hey he's a racist asshole just FYI, so if you dont want to go I understand, but I got your back if you wanna come"" that would be another story.

But suggesting she **shouldnt** go because of others racism is fucked up and exclusionary to her. Youre protecting yourself from the awkwardness of having to defend her (or not), and even though it's not intentional, you're furthering the racism by catering to racists."
cr0sjf,"YTA if you did this. If it bothers you so much then talk about it or go to counseling if communication isn't something you guys can do. Also maybe clean your own car for your own sake, its disruptive to have to do things in a messy environment."
cr0ula,NTA- give your notice and it's not your job to make sure they have enough staff. Take care of yourself.
cr0wjg,"YTA - you’ve never spoken to him about it before, or made a complaint about the plants. He’s obviously not trying to be malicious."
cr0zpj,"NTA This is one of several reasons that I, a person who loves dogs, think that dog-friendly workplaces are a deeply bad idea. 

Your coworkers will more likely than not view you as an asshole. With only eight people I would not count on confidentiality. You do need to weigh their potential reaction against the inconvenience."
cr109w,[deleted]
cr13uu,The real asshole here is the company's overtime policies. How it makes any sense at all to apply for overtime at the start of the month before you know how much overtime you'll work is absolutely beyond me. What a fucking joke.
cr182n,"NTA

I remember being homeless in california. I had a job and everything, just no home, or car for that matter.

I rented a motel room, it was $600 a month but it was worth it to have a place for myself instead of a local shelter or on the street with the other homeless.

His friend fucked up by waiting so long and now he has to live with those consequences. If that means living in a motel room for awhile, then that's his fault.

Your boyfriend is being completley unfair and unreasonable, he is crossing several lines and completely ignoring your own needs and requests. He *is the biggest ass here*."
cr1h8e,NTA keep cracking jokes at his expense. So what if he stops “confiding” in you about his affairs. Better you know less about it so you don’t feel awkward in front of his girlfriend and that you can continue to be friends with him without feeling gross about his character.
cr1i0l,"NTA.

You outright said you didn't want a phone from them. They chose not to listen, and now are pissed. Fun how people are sometimes, right? They'll get over it."
cr1icp,"> my parents are asking me to take the bus there to help her get used to her routine of waking up, going to the bus stop and walk around a 2000 student school for classes.

Highschool, you say? 

NAH. 

Like, she'll be fine. Highschool here is 13 (we don't have these middle school whatevers) and it'd be expected for a 13 year old to be perfectly fine doing these things alone. Even the most helicopter of parents would do like, a practice run of the busses if the kid hadn't caught busses solo before or something. 

Honestly.. would she even want this? an older, out of school sibling catching the bus with her? Showing her where things are? Like... that's be weird right?"
cr1jgt,"NAH if you try to ask her about it nicely without pushing and accept it if she says no, but if you get forceful then you'd be TA.

cr1xpx,"NAH. You both have justifiable perspectives. It’s easy to be overprotective in a long-distance relationship, and this guy has already given you a bad impression. She probably just wants to have a drink with a could-be friend. Neither of you are in the wrong, I’d say. Some might think you’re being distrustful of your girlfriend for not wanting her to go, but I understand what you mean, and I think it’s a normal reaction. The guy already made an advance, so you have the right to be wary"

This will differ from person to person, as fun is objective. He may well think you're anit fun for not being into murder. That doesn't mean he's in the norm. a good general rule of thumb is law. Illegal shit being obviously ok to tell someone off about in most cases.

First: Unless someone is in your care (like a child you're babysitting) ""abandon"" is the wrong word.

Second: Start using your words.

Have a talk, tell her that you often you naturally feel positive about things and even when you don't, you want to focus on the positive because you think it's way better for your stress levels. Ask her to help you with this. You know she loves to analyze things, but you can't emotionally handle very many critical comments. So maybe with you she can just help you focus on the positive, and save the analytical stuff for another friend?

Talk #2: Gossip. You want to break the habit. You read an article about preparing for the workforce and how gossip is a career killer, so you're starting now to try to stop talking about other people. You're hoping you can do it together! It would be fun! You can fine each other a quarter, or challenge each other to find another topic within 5 seconds, or assign each other random topics like they do in improv.

Talk #3: More community. You love seeing her but when you're together all day you don't have as much to talk about. Let's start inviting different people to lunch! On Wednesdays, let's have lunch with someone else and then on Thursdays we can talk about our lunches. In classes, you're worried about looking like a snobbish clique. So let's talk to other people during class. You want to give other people a chance, be more of a community, get to know what's great about different people. You think it will be good practice for college, when you'll have to be able to start conversations and make new friends.

Have these talks a couple of weeks apart because it's too much for her to digest as one talk. Keep practicing this stuff, but most importantly be up front that you're purposely trying to be positive, not gossip, and make more friends.

When you go away to college, your friendship might die a natural death. Especially if she goes away to college, too. This year, don't make any promises to keep in daily or even weekly touch. When it's closer to graduation, let her know you're not sure what the workload or your stress levels will be like, so you might have to focus on studies or have lots of complete alone time. Tell her that if you're not in touch as much you don't want her to think you don't care.

But you don't have to commit to slamming the door. After you're in college, you might find you want to spend a bit of time with her on holiday breaks. If not, you can cross that bridge when you come to it. I guess the skills you want to develop here are a) giving a friend a chance by communicating what you want and b) ending a friendship gently, without ghosting or yelling mean things. These are fantastic grown-up skills to have so start practicing them now."

This is the conundrum of immigrant parenting in America. At some point you're going to have to start shifting the dynamic of your relationship if you want things to change. There will be some growing pains, but you need to start letting them know you'd like to be able to discuss more with them than school and work and you think it will bring you all closer"
cr2w0y,NAH you need to look out for yourself. But have you considered talking to him about this? He may not realize how draining he is being. Maybe you could ask him to be mindful of how often he vents to you or to lead in by asking “can I vent?” He might change his behavior if you talk to him about it.

I struggled to get pregnant and when I did the first time I lost it.

My friends tiptoed round me because they didn't want to upset me but my problems aren't their problems and as a good friend it's my duty to be there for them as they are for me, without letting my feelings get in the way.

I do now have a beautiful baby.

I hate when people say ""you should be more considerate because X can't get pregnant"" because there's nothing to consider. Your successes don't affect their losses at all. If they want to get huffy and puffy over it then so be it but it's not at the fault of those who have had success.

Your friend sounds toxic and self absorbed. She's suffering from that horrible mentality that the world has done a great injustice because you conceived and suddenly the green eyed monster struck.

cr3o7g,"Uhhh. This has major sexual assault vibes to me.

Now is one of those times. You should apologize to your mother, not because you are an asshole, but because your asshole is no longer under your direct control. She is still ‘new’ to your current situation, and you will need to sit her down and let her know just how bad things can get.

I took my family out for a brunch maybe three weeks ago, and my wife asked to join her parents (down for the day) at IKEA for a little shopping. Grandparents would buy a shelf, and then drop my wife at home on their way out of town. Well, she was the only one of us two with house keys, and in the ten minutes it took to realize our mistake and get the grandparents to drop her off at the first possible moment, I shat myself in front of our two children.

Edit to add; OP says in a comment how it happened. He was making a left hand turn through the intersection and cut someone off going straight. He cut someone off when he didn't even have the right of way. He's absolutely at fault here and anyone trying to say he's legally not at fault clearly hasn't dealt with a circumstance like this.

cr67ag,"NTA. 

You've told him many times that what he is doing is not appreciated, not helpful, demeaning and hurtful.

Imagine, if you will, a person in a wheelchair going up a hill. Your friend grabs their chair and pushes them, they yell at him to stop. They do not want to be pushed. They do not feel comfortable with him pushing them. They want him to stop. He refuses, for he is ""trying to help"" and they should be grateful. 

It's the same thing with you. It's exactly as obnoxiously outrageous. and you have every right to be angry, upset, and even cut off all contact with him. 

> I dont want people sat here all night waiting for you to finish

I also want to reassure you that this says *far* more about him than it does about your stammer. This says that he doesn't have the patience to sit and listen to you, and that impatience matters more than respecting you 

I once spoke to a person with such a stammer that they could spend a full minute on a single syllable. I was impatient too, but I have a basic level of respect for people and instead of interrupting allowed them to finish. Like a normal person. The only time I didn't was when they gave a defeated type look (they were young, and it worked as a prompt to forget it and keep going)."

You care, you see your friend being hurt. That sucks. It's upsetting you. You're a good friend.

People should NEVER change who they are to make a relationship work. We can change behavior, we can change little things ... but making excuses for other people... that is not something anybody should be doing.

I think this needs a bigger conversation. You should let your friend know what you're seeing, she's suffering, seeing that hurts you. You care. That's that. 

You just approached the situation in the wrong way. You're not a therapist... (or else you may have approached it right!) So don't blame yourself for not hitting the mark.

She hasn't learned that you shouldn't make excuses for other people's bad behavior.  Try to lead her to info to teach her how to think. Don't tell her how to think.

I remember reading a post similar to this. A persons parents became old and just demanded to be financially taken care of by their son.

cr8cc4,NTA. Before your original hairdresser comes back just book in a few appointments with the new guy so you don't have to worry. When she asks just say that he did such a good job last time you loved it and want to see if he can keep it up. If she gets pissed at him that's no fault on you.
cr8dk6,"NTA. you live on their property and he still calls them from the guest house? He needs to cut the umbilical cord. I was a mommas boy until she died, but you can love your mother and still have a sense of independence.

cr8gj2,"NAH - she probably loves you like her own sister. But she can’t really understand that you’re not going to be a part of her life moving forward. The unfortunate thing about breakups is that you break up with their family too.

cr8gyi,"NTA. I can’t stress this enough. I have a sister exactly like this, and everyone has stopped giving her money. Her boyfriend doesn’t give her money, he just eats food and does god knows what all day. Don’t give her money because chances are she won’t spend it on food."
cr8gyr,NTA you’re an adult for fuck sake. It’s NONE of her business.
cr8hej,"NTA, but you are an adult now. You don't have to follow all of her rules. Yeah, the security of living at home has its perks, but it sounds like mom is a little too protective.

I don't like gendered slurs any more than the next person (actually probably less depending on the room I'm in), but this is someone who's been betrayed by his SO of over a decade, someone who presumably he thought he was going to spend the rest of his life with. He's incredibly angry, and he has a right to be. All he's doing is expressing his anger, and expressing it specifically at his ex - it's not like he's decided all women are whores and joined MGTOW. If this isn't how he usually talks, which based on your post I feel comfortable assuming, it's probably worth cutting him some slack in this exceptional moment.

Moreover he didn't actually slam his fists or throw things at her, he just wanted to - and stopped himself from doing so. You're putting a lot of judgment on someone for a first reaction they controlled.

Let him be angry without you writing him off as a person.

EDIT: And moreso based on increasingly evidence, like OP demanding Sam apologize to his ex for calling her names to OP to regain her friendship, that OP is a troll."

So you think it's better to be rude/disrespectful to your mother? Chores and school work come before friends. If your mom tells you to do your chores, do your chores.

If you're not at all close then that's fine, but if you talk regularly and omitted this, then you've brought drama on yourself.

If she oversteps her boundaries, then it's up to you as the parent to put her in her place.  Your obligation is to your child and you need to be able to stand up to pressure.  Go forth and parent as you wish.

crffup,"NTA. The dog wasn't hers to start with and it doesn't sound like he was getting the attention he needed. He lost his long-term owners and had to leave his home -- he is probably confused himself. So to be taken somewhere where he doesn't get much attention and has two children (who are old enough to know better) treating him in a very irritating manner... that's unfair. Plus, it was kind of dangerous for her kids. You said he's a sweet dog and I have no doubt he is, but even sweet animals have limits. If one of the kids really hurt him or scared him, he could've snapped/scared them/nipped them. You never know.

It seems that money was a gift, intended to finance your getting a dog. You’re using said money to get a dog. In my opinion, Pit Bulls get a bad rap and can be incredibly docile and loving with proper care and training. This pup choice of yours... I think it’s awesome.

Did mum give a reason why she was against your choice? I would understand her upset if she had been attacked by a poorly trained Pit Bull. I would understand her hesitation if she was concerned about potential prejudice and fear this particular breed would bring.

Be aware that depending where you are, having bald tyres not only causes insurance issues, but legal ones too. 
- You as the driver will be held responsible if the police notice it for any reason.
- If you do get into an accident you could find yourself deemed at fault.

If you think they cant afford it but you have some cash, then are you able to buy them new tyres? Make it clear it’s a one off, but doing it drives home the point that you won’t allow this to continue (so in future they have to be more promo-active); but don’t be too concerned about the cost this once as you are at least getting some free childcare out of it.

Depending what they’re like this could just lead to expectations that you pay for more in future, but it shouldn’t if you do it right, and I guess if it does then you have bigger problems."
crhju1,"NTA. Dont work for free. 5 minutes every day is 25 minutes in a 5 day work week. Thats 50 minutes (nearly an hour) of unpaid labor a pay period if youre paid every other week. And thats only 5 minutes a day. You said 5 - **15**

15 minutes would make that 75 minutes a week or 150 minutes (like 2.5 hours). So every pay period you lose out on 1 - 2.5 hours of pay. That shit adds up.

cri98v,"YTA - you answered her question honestly, which is fine. You went wrong when you put unnecessary pressure on her by saying you'd be disappointed if she didn't ""use her degree"" in her job, period. That's terrifying for someone about to graduate.

This is a *huge* red flag. He has no respect for you, your things, your boundaries, and your wishes. He is demonstrating to you here that what *you* want or need does not matter - only *his* wants matter. He is demonstrating that he does not give a fuck about you!

>And he said “just don’t expect me to ever spend another cent on you...

Oh look, he's a manipulative bastard too.

>I’ve been setting aside $20-40 per paycheck for a few months to save up to eventually assist him in buying my engagement ring.

Okay. Let's pause and think about it for a second. This man has not been contributing, has been stealing from you, has been completely disregarding you, your opinions, thoughts, needs, wants, bitches you out for wanting to spend your own money on yourself, and is manipulating you, to the point where *you're* saving for your *own engagement ring*.

Are you really sure you're going to marry this horrible person? Please seriously reconsider your relationship before this vampire bleeds you dry. And before his disrespect for you gets worse.

ETA: Thanks for all the upvotes guys, but it looks like we're wasting our breath. Judging from the few replies, OP has no intention of ending this relationship and probably isn't replying because she doesn't want to hear it. You can lead a horse to water, but I suppose you can't make it drink."

crio6b,"NTA I am from Australia (yr 10 but doing 1+2 subjects) and I understand it is super hard to move during these years, I think it was really unfair of your dad to shout at you like that and it seems like he's only looking at it from your perspective"
criu3s,"NTA, she's got less than 2 years of school left and you are totally correct, dropping out would be a big mistake.

crj0k8,NTA How would abortion have the same affect to you as your very real brain tumour? I get that kids use awful terms and dont understand the impact but she should be able to stop saying that.
crj37b,Definitely YTA. Why tell her about the shit that your Mom said about her? Your girlfriend did nothing wrong other than wanting to surprise you and having a momentary lapse of judgment. Telling her what your Mom said will only strain their relationship and it sounds like your Mom is massively overreacting too
crjelb,"NAH Sounds like something for r/relationships

More than anything, talk to her about his you feel."
crjewe,"YTA. You’re probably correct that it would have annoyed the unnamed celebrity, why do you care though? The celebrity would have forgotten about it in an hour but your husband would remember it for a lifetime.

crjgl8,NTA but expect fall out from grumpy relatives.
crjhiw,"ESH.

crjti4,ESH Your supposed to stop before the crosswalk and then proceed forward regardless of how the traffic is. Sounds like you both weren't paying attention but since you're operating a car the responsibility falls more on you.
crjwr9,"NTA for not going. Nobody can invite you to something the night before and demand that you go, not even family — it’s just not reasonable to expect. 

That said, this is family, it’s not like you’re going to stop interacting with them any time soon. You might want to ameliorate the situation by sitting PM down for a talk and saying, “hey, we really want to be involved in family stuff with C and CM! We just need more of a head’s up. It makes us feel a little excluded when you tell us about things so last minute, like we’re an afterthought. But if you could give us a little notice, we’d really like to go to more family things!” Or something along those lines."
crjym1,"YTA.

You can't keep throwing it back in her face. If you can't forgive her or get over it then you can't be friends.

crkc6s,"YTA, assuming I'm understanding this correctly.

You're driving around a busy parking lot looking for a spot, and you see a guy getting into a car about to leave, with a car stopped next to him. You don't realize that the other car is waiting for the spot? You thought they were just stopped in the middle of a busy parking lot next to an about-to-be-free spot to enjoy the scenery and have a quick wank? C'mon, dude. YTA for **stealing** the parking spot, not for ""not giving up"" the parking spot."
crkfly,"NTA. Regardless of the reasons for the grounding, that cat has been a constantly family member in your daughter's life since she was 4 years old and it's a big, big deal to lose a pet so close to her like that. IMO your wife should concede just this once because of the extenuating circumstances. If it were a minor reason she was upset, like she dropped a pizza or something, that would be one thing, but she lost a member of the family yesterday. Your wife should try to be more understanding. Yes, you're a team, but this is a unique and delicate situation."
crkjae,"NTA. I'm not sure why your partner cannot keep his space clean like an adult, but your feelings about this space that you *share* matters just as much as his does. This is not a case of you disrespecting his feelings about it, it's a case of him not even considering yours.

p.s. yall gonna get ants or cockroaches or some shit with food trash. I don't suggest just doing it behind his back, but have a serious talk with him about the matter."
crkjrs,"ESH.

He shouldn't have drunk the whisky if he had promised to be someone at X time and knew this would make him late.

If he wanted to enjoy his summer with his electronics, he shouldn't have started smoking and then tried to get other kids to smoke, too."
crkp43,"NTA (ywnbta). Tell him his repeated attempts at sexual assault on your SO has made both of you incredibly uncomfortable to be around him and nobody is going to enjoy going on a trip with someone with clear issues, no boundaries, and no respect for anyone else, and that he can rejoin things like trips with you when he learns some self respect and some respect for other people."
crkwt8,"NAH... Lots of people do it the way you said, lots of people do it the way she said. 


AS LONG AS....


1. You are not making it into a thing and getting other people involved in your first disagreement as an engaged couple. I hope you don't actually mean 'most of the people' you know or try to see who is on your side in a disagreement.


2. You understand that for you this was a thing that took months and involved a lot of planning, but that is really hardly anything compared to the fact that she's wearing it for the rest of her life.


3. Are okay with it if she wants to exchange it. I mean, that's always a risk if you do it your way. For a person who doesn't wear jewelry to go to a 1C higher end of the Cs.... Like, the women you asked were taking the perspective of someone who doesn't wear jewelry, or for what they want? I don't wear a lot of jewelry, and I wanted something really understated. These women who helped you knew her, and her style, and weren't just like ""OMG, that's the shiniest prettiest one and I wish I had it!""
 (Edit- I just googled the description of the ring. That.... Is a lot for someone who doesn't wear jewelry. Definitely make sure she doesn't want to exchange it and communicate that you would be totally fine with it.)

4. You now understand that this is her personality. You won't do things like surprise her with a car or make other decisions for her in the future."
crkxcc,"YTA. Why have you got to live this out online? Why can’t you speak to your friends privately, either face to face or via email/text?

crl0kn,"YTA. I get your intention but the gif comes across accusatory and mean spirited. Half of the stuff in it are beyond some people's control and comes across as ""If you don't have a perfect life, fuck you, you're going to end up fat and die young."" I mean - under the stress part - ""struggling to pay your bills is the perfect way to build stress""? It's hardly something people do intentionally, and something most cannot control."
crl644,"NTA - a useful gift is better than no gift, which is what they would have got from me!"
crl6xp,"NTA. Your claustrophobia is reason enough to say that you shouldn’t be driving and the presence of local public transportation is enough to say why you don’t need to learn how to drive.

crlld2,[deleted]
crlmgg,"YTA agreeing to be in someone’s bridal party is agreeing to a monetary commitment. 

Separately, the traditional purpose of wedding gifts is to help a couple begin their lives together. In an era when couples didn’t move in until they were married it made sense to give them physical gifts to start their home. Nowadays, most people already have spatulas and flatware and live together before getting married, so an avenue to help them set up their lives in a financial token. Your opinion on it is irrelevant. If that’s what they’re asking for, and you’re in a financial position to comfortably give it, you are an asshole for not doing it and using the fact that you’re already spending money (which you agreed to previously) as an excuse."
crltnb,"YTA. He's right, the other times were different because the invitations had been if people waned to hang out *to* smoke. Someone who doesn't like to swim would probably decline an invite to swim at the pool, but they still probably want to go on a group trip to the beach just to be included and hang out together while others swim.

You basically were inviting everyone else but telling him he wasn't welcome for no other reason than your group's prejudice against people who don't smoke or drink."
crlwiw,"NTA.  It’s yours to sell and you are doing someone a favor.  If your parents think your brother needs one of his own, they should help him purchase one."
crlxsc,"YTA

crm3dt,"NTA, you did what’s right."
crm78t,"YTA dude. She’s a 12 year old girl that probably just told you not to come because she didn’t think it was going to be something you’d enjoy. But you did - and you should tell her that. Explain how good it was, your logic behind not approaching her (didn’t want to embarrass her), and tell her she was fantastic."
crm9bv,"Eh the only asshole thing you did was say “wow I wish I could take you” cause that just sounds like you’re pitying yourself a bit, but NAH. I’d definitely suggest working on your driving anxiety though, in case there’s ever an emergency where you need to drive a long distance in an unfamiliar area."
crm9n1,"NTA - She needs to respect boundaries, I do find it quite funny that she told you to tell her if you don't want her using your laptop. Is she stupid? You were pretty clear with her about not having food around the laptop,"
crm9q0,"NTA, he was asked if noise was an issue and he said no, hasn’t said anything, he really can’t pull that card now. He may have just been annoyed thinking it wasn’t loud, but you were super polite about it, you broached it as a favour to you rather than an expectation, he really overreacted."

crmdlf,"I guess ESH. 

Some people dont care about bed sides too much and instead focus on access. Some people have a side come hell or high water. 


If the bedroom was flipped and the right side was against a wall, it sounds as if she would still sleep on the right side. 

Is the bed fixed in such a way it cant be moved at all?"
crmfcn,"I don’t think you would be so NTA... taking the food home is pretty rude and poor form, and her answer to you when asked about it was beyond oblivious. But rather than singling her out, I think it would be better to report this as a general problem, and to ask management to reiterate that the pantry items are a courtesy for use as-needed while in the office (not intended to be someone’s primary source of food)."
crmg7r,NTA. But you should’ve left it alone when you heard their opinions. They weren’t going to be swayed. Be careful.
crmngz,NTA. Just pick up the stuff and leave. You would be the asshole if you actually got involved anymore than that. The ex is right. This relationship doesn’t sound healthy.
crmnym,"NTA. I’d certainly be upset if I paid for a large coffee and got a medium. And that’s not even considering the can/draft issue, you paid for a 20 Oz. draft, and you got a 16 Oz. can. The employee was wrong for not informing you. It’s really as simple as that. I’m kind of baffled anyone would say YTA. The employee not making the policies or prices is irrelevant... they neglected to inform you that you wouldn’t be getting 20 Oz, and you wouldn’t be getting draft."
crmpn5,I'd say NAH. It's your hair and you can change your mind if you wanted to. Plus it wasn't like you promised to donate it specifically to someone. You can say you've decided to keep it in memory of your cousin too. Your mom was probably just curious. She would be the asshole if she guilt-tripped you about it though.
crmroq,"YTA

Important context for your post: you post here regularly about your daughter: her friends ransacked your house, she got kicked out of medical school for threatening and bullying people, she bullied someone so badly at school that they tried to kill themselves, and she told her teenage cousin that she was so ugly that she needed plastic surgery. She also has extensive issues with alcohol.

Your daughter has been ‘nice’ for what, all of two months, and you’re going to give in again and give her whatever she wants? Your wife is right, she’s too old to be having house parties at her parents’ house when she can just go clubbing or to the pub like everyone else. It sounds like any recent improvements in her behaviour are down to you and your wife finally acting like proper parents and setting boundaries. Emily is too old to be “rewarded for good behaviour” fgs, she’s a fully grown adult who has treated other people horribly. She’s not being ‘well behaved’, she is finally beginning to behave like a decent member of society. Follow your wife’s lead and continue to set boundaries. Your daughter is not a child."
crmrv6,"NTA... sort of. 

I understand what you are trying to do for and with your dad... I think.

Are you trying to keep him busy and distracted so that he doesn’t dwell on how he feels about the breakup? 

Is it really about the house? 

If this is about your dad, you should consider hiring a crew and getting him some help with the house, and then maybe take a break with him to actually talk? He sounds like maybe he needs to talk to someone about what he is feeling. Someone to listen and help him emotionally navigate some wounds that aren’t going to fixed with patched drywall. 

You’re not TA, but you do need to listen and help him open up about what he may be feeling. He may be grieving the loss of that relationship, and rather than distract from his grief, he will be better off in the long term to move through the grief. 

Hope this helps. It’s tough to have to see our parents be human, but it’s also a testament to their parenting when we can step up as adults and be their rock when they start to falter.

Good luck with the house. Hopefully there are no more surprises."
crms2d,"NTA, I'd break up with someone in a heartbeat if they had a problem with me seeing my friends, male or female.

You sound like a selfish, pretentious person to me. Their role in your life was to raise you and provide you with what you needed, not be hip and interesting people.

If what they are doing is making them happy, then you should be happy for them. Maybe after years of looking out for you they have forgotten how to care for themselves. Maybe take them out for some surprise activities one day, like lunch at a new restaurant and a hike?

crnovz,NTA. Using her essay would be cheating. Why do parents think this is a good idea? What do they think they're teaching their kids? That cheating is okay? Good for you for rewriting it using YOUR language and your words. You are the better person here.

crnq7s,"EDIT: changed to ESH after given new info. 

 This is the very issue about sharing the mental load us women complain about.

We don't have to be told what to do. We see stuff that needs to be done around the house and do it. You're a grown adult, why can't you see that food that's left on the counter needs to be refrigerated without being told?

As for you refrigerating when you cook, that shows that you are only seeing you instead of the collective - your cook vs her food. Each refrigerates their own.

Living together is team effort, not you do you. If she forgot something, be a team player and help."

crnxgb,"NTA, sounds like her current living situation isn’t stable and giving her a fallback is good. A 14 year old shouldn’t have to deal with that kind of uncertainty over living arrangements."

croetj,"NAH, you don't mean to do so, but what you're doing is demeaning their effort to connect with you or at least show you respect. If they are acknowledging this pronunciation is not likely right, they are trying to be respectful of you and are inviting you to tell them the correct way. They likely want you to correct them so that they can do better in the future. If you blow it off you are not only telling them they are wrong but not facilitating their better pronunciation, which is uncomfortable for all parties. Now they don't know *what* to say because they know their way is wrong but have no guidance on how to improve."

O que? **His POV isn't about safety at all: he wants to be able to fuck without a condom on, and he wants you to undergo an invasive medical procedure so that sex feels better for him**. Why doesn't he get a vasectomy? Don't let him play you.

NTA, and in any case, going barrier-free with a guy you're hooking up with (not even dating!) is risky, and even if you had an IUD or were on hormonal birth control, using condoms as well would be wise."

cros0h,"YTA. I'll be downvoted to oblivion for this, but ""running some errands for a couple hours together and grabbing some tacos"" sounds exactly like something a man would do with his wife, and you're settling into a comfortable pattern with someone who isn't your wife.

I would imagine that if she went out for a meal with a male friend she thought was attractive, you'd feel uncomfortable."
crotl2,"NTA.  She, however, is an enormous gaping anal cavity for taking on the obligation to care for a living creature and blowing it off. 

You should tell her to get on it immediately both because your cat is at risk and because if she's not willing to do the bare minimum to take care of that cat she doesn't deserve to have him."

crp6ee,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but YTA. The dog is your responsibility, and the dog knocked over a cyclist driving on a public path. Yeah, the cyclist could have signalled you, but your dog is not his responsibility.  He doesn't know that your dog is reactive (I always called this 'agressively Happy' like, the dog just wants to greet, but can be a little too jumpy/barky). You need to be more aware of your surroundings when you're walking the dog. Maybe you might consider walking off the path a bit, with yourself in between the dog and the path, until the dog chills out a bit around new people/dogs/bikes. Training is a process, and while I don't think you purposely did anything wrong, it's up to you to keep your dog from knocking cyclists over."
crp8oe,"ESH. Your friend's cousin was definitely acting like an asshole, but you came off as an asshole by saying ""treat me like a white person"". Don't try to bring race into anything, because it can make things worse.

Something like ""Damn man, what is your damn problem"" would've been more suitable because it'll prompt you to distance yourself away from that asshole."

crpfay,"NAH - she, obviously, didn't do anything (except not be as strong a salesperson as your company would like - but that's not being an asshole)

YOU didn't do anything except your job, acting on bosses orders.  You can certainly feel sympathy for her, but you're not an asshole.

Store owner isn't an asshole for putting in place an action plan based on employee's prior performance, nor an asshole for handing the job of informing her off to you since you're her supervisor.

It's unfortunate about her sister and mum, but it sounds like all of this was based on her performance before these events."
crph7h,"YTA.

>Now this was her brothers wedding and I imagined if she really wanted me there she would’ve asked her parents/brother to have one more guest so I don’t feel singled out.

That's not how weddings work. It's the bride and groom's choice to invite whomever they like. You've only met him four times. It's not appropriate to petition them to invite friends of guests just so those friends don't feel ""singled out""."

Your wife doesn't go to any of your games, but calls you out for not coming to **every** one of *her* games? 

That is pretty hypocritical on her part. 

I would just be straight with her, and tell her you are willing to go to 2-3 games out of her season, but this is rec league, and she is a grown woman. She is doing this for fun. If it isn't fun for her, that is another matter to figure out altogether."
crq0yl,"YTA - you drove, that means you're her ride. Leaving your friend to find her own way home so you can visit your fuck buddy would make you a shit friend."
crq2ho,"NTA. I'm a caregiver for people who have suffered traumatic brain injuries (among other major injuries). It's devastating. It's too late to worry about safety when you're severely injured on the side of the road. Wearing a helmet could be the difference between minor injuries and you spending the rest of your life working as his full-time caregiver - and trust me, it's not an easy job. Is he ready to put you in that position? Is he ready to put *himself* in that position? No? He can wear a helmet. Trust me. I've seen mothers, spouses, and children agonize over the question: ""What if they had *just worn a helmet*?"" It takes half of a second to become permanently disabled, and then you have someone like me wiping your butt for rest of your life. 

This is what I'd call a healthy ultimatum. You shouldn't be forced to make this type of commitment with a man who is knowingly and intentionally increasing his risks for these types of injuries - *especially* when he knows how you feel regarding this topic."
crq3kh,"NTA Do you know if she was ever really pregnant?
She could just be some emotionally immature stalker. I would start documenting her actions and record any calls you have with her and under no circumstances would i be anywhere alone with her."

crqfql,"NTA. She’s 25. She needs to get a job and save up enough money to move out there and set herself up with a roomie situation and have an emergency fund, and find a job. If she has no money and no job you’re never going to get rid of her"

crr2j1,"NTA, some people don't understand the concept of ""mentally preparing"" for being around people. I specifically avoid having ANYONE come to my house, because if we're at my house then I have nowhere to escape when I've reached my social limit."
crr2v2,"NAH. I have no sympathy for parents who come to visit and then expect their kids to put them up without consulting their own roommates first. I remain baffled why both parents would want to stay over in their kid’s small apartment (also in nyc, so I feel justified making this assumption) instead of getting an Airbnb. 

A friend of mine works weird hours (either like 5am-6pm or 12pm-1am - that kind of thing) had her roommate invite her parents to stay in their shared living room. My friend told them she had to be at work early, but they stayed up drinking and chatting right outside her room anyway. Then, when my friend woke up at 4 as she had warned them she would do, they were pissy about it. In that case, it is super clear that primary residents should priority over visitors. 

As for this case, these are two full grown adults who can afford an Airbnb. They don’t get to dictate what happens in your room. And you invited your guest first, regardless of how often he stays."
crr3l8,Nta. Omg. I agree McDonalds is terrible. But she is also not respecting You and your decision making as a father. It was a treat. Not an everyday occurance. Your ex is over reacting. She made it clear. Now you know. Respect and trust for the well being of your daughter goes both ways though.
crr553,Man I always will have his back through everything but my mom is important for me too and her decision is the final. I hate when my brother tries to disobey her despite telling him numerous times. Also my brother knows about the car's fragility.
crr68d,"NTA. I don't think you're the asshole if they don't have two of the drinks you ask. At a mcD (not the same, I know), they once forgot my brothers burgers and we got a few ice creams for free along with the burgers. There are definitely ways for them to give you a normal size in a bit of a bigger drink, as the policy is to keep the costumer happy."

crrndy,"NTA - your brothers a leech and its not your problem.

crro6z,"Nta. She seems like she can't rlly take hints or notice details of when you're helping. If she asked you to move in, and instead of breaking it to you herself, she had her parents do it, even though if she wanted to tell you, she could have done it when she was awake"

Edit: Thanks for the silver!"

crs9eq,"NTA. You have accepted his cultural and religious differences to you as he has integrated into British norms and cultures by drinking. You have looked after his dog as he has failed to. Now, he is going to be the father of a child (and that child will sadly have a mother with a drug issue). Out of all of this, you only needed a moment to pray. I'm not religious, but I can recognise how much you needed that peace and communication with God. He can't give you one moment for that, but he's willing to dump his other baggage on you. I don't blame you. You've done your role as a parent but he can't reciprocate that energy by giving you the respect and space you need. I hope you feel better soon, but you did what you had to do."

crsah0,"I'll say NAH because I don't think whatever you did was intentional, but clearly something was up. I mean, the fact is that people don't usually bother to get security if they're not feeling uncomfortable or unsafe in some way. Even if you don't feel like you did anything to make her uncomfortable, clearly something you said or did did. I just don't know if that's really asshole behaviour."
crsb5z,"NTA. Plenty of people ask me why/how I got into my job. there is a high turn around in my job and Im among the ones that have been there the longest so people also ask why I have stayed so long.

crsl6l,"NTA - and for reference I live in MN which is an “at will” state meaning you can leave or be let go for any reason at will - not even two weeks. Employers rarely (if ever) give notice so why do we as employees feel that need? 

Two weeks notice is polite but not required and definitely not recommends in toxic work environments which is what your job sounds like. Given the history of this place I would quit when you are ready and let the company reap the rewards of shoddy management."
crsojz,[deleted]
crspqe,"YTA Come on, dude. This isn't even ""sugarcoating"" because it isn't incest. Incest is two family members fucking. She is not related to the either brother, it's not incest. Painting it as ""am I the asshole for not sugarcoating"" really lessens what you did which is overexaggerate a situation that was going to make kids feel bad about something they had absolutely no control over. No kid wants to be the product of incest. Of course they were going to be upset and it isn't even true. 

Is it a weird situation? Yes. But not incest. And the kids don't need to hear that's where they came from."
crsrra,NTA. She IS controlling and emotionally manipulative to boot.  Please stop apologizing - your trying to get her to communicate while she’s sulking like a toddler is exactly what she wants.
crsshv,Nta. Honestly she doesn’t sound like a real friend. Sounds toxic to me.
crt2cf,NTA- you are 27 freaking years old. You don’t need to tell her anything. If I was you I’d move out. Live YOUR life for you not her.

crtb7x,"Sorry, but YTA. Just because she wasn’t obviously offended doesn’t mean your comment wasn’t potentially offensive. Plus, plenty of women don’t feel comfortable voicing their discomfort in front of strange men. The story she tells her friends about your interaction might be very different.

crthv0,"NTA. This is hilarious. Dorky, but hilarious. I think talk to the hand got lost in the late 90s though. She snapped at you and got some feedback she didn’t like. It’s a good life lesson in patience. Also her friends were probably laughing at you."

crtpgs,"NTA. She, and a lot of teachers and admin have this problem.

Get her a hobby or sit down and find something quieter and less self-destructive to do."
crtqh5,"NTA. My eyes bulged like in Tom and Jerry or something on the transition from *she's 19* to *he's 53*. When I was 19, my dad was 53. They're definitely at different checkpoints in life and he seems mostly just interested in sex. If this happened 2 years ago, it'd be illegal. If you genuinely care about her and haven't breached the topic already, I think it would do more good than harm to let her know how you feel but don't push it too far if she's not having it let her reach the end on her own."

I took a surfing class once, and the instructors were adamant that you have to watch out for swimmers, not the other way around.

crtuny,"NTA

Your parents sound like they want an excuse to control you. You are active physically and mentally, you don’t use all of your screen time on internet time wasters (reddit is a time waster but you can’t be perfect), and your parents can’t give a logical reason why your screen time is being reduced. 

Maybe remind your parents that once you move away you’ll have to self-regulate your screen time, you can either practice with them at home or figure it out on the go. You sound like you’ll be able to adjust easily, but this excuse might be good enough to at least earn yourself a little more screen time at some point."
crtusl,NTA. Her story changed when she decided it wouldn’t benefit her to stick to the truth. You did your duty.
crtz7e,"NTA.  You've both had a busy week, it sounds like you want some alone time.  And they do say absence makes the heart grow fonder.

He's being a jerk for pushing so hard about it.  My guess is he gives into parental pressure easily.

cruj2t,NTA I’m confused. Randal says she’s creeped out that you didn’t text her first. But she BLOCKED you so even if you DID text her she wouldn’t have gotten it anyway.  I also don’t see why she should have even blocked you since you weren’t even there when whatever happened went down. Makes Susie sound like an asshole for punishing you by association
cruj3x,"A mild YTA. I'm of the opinion that major alterations to your body are something your SO gets to voice an opinion on - not a veto or even a vote, but an opinion.

crumyb,"I’m gonna go with NTA though it was rude to blow up, but you know with family, little things that seem trivial have a way of blowing up. In your defense, that is really fucking obnoxious on their part.

cruq86,NAH school is important and those are very easily treated issues. It does seem kind of ridiculous to me to skip a year of college over it when the issues can quickly be resolved.

The dental thing also isn't complicated to fix and they aren't life threatening issues.

I've been somewhat sheltered from the worst of my grandma's nonsense because my mother has made sure of it, but we limit our contact with her (and bite our tongues a lot). If your grandmother's behavior/attitude is causing stress in your life, then you should limit your contact with her. Perhaps continue to exchange cards for holidays, but beyond that it sounds like further dialogue just isn't worth the aggravation. It's entirely possible that she's just a toxic person- and sometimes toxic people can poison your life if you let them."
cruyxx,"Dude definitely NTA - this guy sounds aggressive, violent and dangerous. If he’s angry about something as small as you not letting him through a side door, imagine how angry he could get if your kid accidentally broke something in his house.

She probably already knew on some level parents shouldn’t be breaking toys in anger and refuse to talk to their children for days on end. You’re right it’s abusive. 

She’s sensitive to it. But what’s done is done. 

If it were me, I’d just apologize for upsetting her and never bring it up again unless she starts the conversation. 

You’re not the asshole for noticing it or pointing it out. And she’s not an asshole for not wanting to address it either with you or to herself, if thats the case."
crvmfi,NTA - especially if it’s common because you didn’t know who’s it was or if it was stolen. You let the police take care of it which I think was all you could have done.
crvmi1,NTA. That’s critical information to know not only for her safety but for the safety of your son if he is left alone in her care. Good luck.
crvn4d,"No rescue will *temporarily foster* him and then give him back just to pay the bills you cant afford. Thata just not how fostering works. If you truly cannot care for him, fully surrender him so he has a chance at not being in an ungodly amount of pain. If hes truly in that much pain take him back to an ER vet and get that under control. No creature deserves that.

So, NTA for giving your dog away because you need someone to take over care, but you would be a major asshole if you think you can give your dog away for an week for someone else to pay his bills"
crvqtm,"NTA. She is basically bullying you, and this has been allowed to continue. If this is your first time responding to her, it may have been a little further than ideal, but it's not as though you were rude back to her. Older people don't get a pass to treat others badly just because they've done more laps around the sun / have fewer left."
crvrt5,"NAH except your father. I would be conflicted as well. Since she is still a minor, if you decided to reach out, I lwould contact her mother first to see if she would be OK with this or wait until she turned 18."
crvv6a,"NTA. This is not a good situation for anyone, and you are stuck trying to make the best of it for you and her.

A LOT of people here are judging the OP based on an incomplete  understanding of U.S. laws, claiming discrimination, which is frankly inappropriate in this case. In the U.S. it would be perfectly legal, and even expected, for the OP to have terminated her employment. The U.S. laws protecting pregnant or disabled workers do not apply to companies with less than 15 employees, due to the economic hardships it imposes on small businesses when they have to retain employees who can only work at reduced capacity. Some states may have stricter laws, but I am not aware of any that would apply to a company with three employees.

Folks, if you're going to use the law as the basis for your judgment, make sure you know what the law actually says first.

Edit: 

Well... this certainly blew up over the last 12 hours. I know a lot of folks aren't going to come back and see this addendum at this late stage, but since quite a few people have been trying to read between the lines of what I said, let me clarify a few things about my position.

First, my judgment of the OP consists solely of the first paragraph. Everything after that is an observation directed at the AITA community. 

Second, my judgment does not assume the OP is an American. In fact, the wording and language of his post makes me believe he is not. Thus my statement that it is inappropriate to judge the OP based on U.S. laws (or morality, for that matter), when in fact we have no idea where he lives. I apologize for not making that clear.

Third, if I were in the OP's situation I would have done the same thing, and it would have absolutely crushed me to do so. This is a no-win situation for a small business owner. The young woman cannot continue to work the job she was hired to do, which is the only job that exists in this very small firm. Keeping one half of your employees on the payroll and providing benefits to them when they are unable to do productive work is a devastating blow to a small business. Furthermore, OP would then have to hire a third person to do the work. Very few small businesses can sustain profitable operations under those conditions, meaning OP would likely go out of business very quickly, and this young woman would still be out of a job, along with the OP and his other employees. 

This, and this alone, is the basis for my judgment."
crvww4,"NTA 

You're just trying to help your friend who has a lot of unresolved issues and even admitted herself that she should probably have an abortion. She says that you're the only person she can go to, so you are probably one of very few people who should be telling her this.

crw0v5,"yta.

as a cashier that works at a very popular food chain, know that we (cashiers) reread the order 1-2 times to make sure it’s correct. it’s on you if you weren’t paying attention. 

when you are given your receipt at the register, you should always double check it so you can catch mistakes early. and if you have any questions or want your order reread more slowly, just ask. easy. 

if your order was correct, and you were missing a burger, that’s when you should go up to an available cashier, skip the line, and ask about it. but if it wasn’t included in the receipt, and you didn’t pay for it, i think you should wait your turn in line."

Not because it would be technically wrong to wake her up making loud noises at 7 AM (outside the required ""quiet time"") but because you're doing something deliberately to be rude and making the situation worse for both her and yourself.

On the other hand, it sounds like your friend just isn't cut/talented enough for the industry. Being supportive/encouraging is nice and all, but it seems like his dreams will never come true and that he'd be better off pursuing a more lucrative career.


This whole story makes me feel bad.


Edit: After thinking about it some I’m going to wager a judgment. I’m going with NAH but under very specific terms and conditions. OP needs to come clean with his friend about the friends future in the industry at the bare minimum. They seem close to one another so I think if OP frames his honesty as coming from a genuine wish to see his friend not waste time and make the most out of life that it might help the message be received. OP should also consider coming clean about having written the online critique, but I have the feeling that the existence of that critique weighs more on OP’s conscience than that of the friend, so it’s not 100% necessary."
crxigr,NAH. Sounds like everyone acted as appropriately as possible with the circumstances. Enjoy the rest of your holiday.

At the end of the day, it really does come down to what your lease says - if you can't have a dog, then that's the end of the story.  I'd confirm that *first* because if your landlord is the 'bad guy' in this scenario, then that's easier for you.

If she was entering a talent show or trying to start a band/music career or something than you’d be an asshole for not telling her, but karaoke is just supposed to be a bit of fun, so i don’t think it’s anyone’s right to say “hey you’re a bad singer, so you shouldn’t do karaoke”.

I can see why she’s upset, but I think that’s mostly on the crowd laughing at her. It’s not hard to just be polite and applaud someone for getting up on stage and trying, even if they’re bad."

cs336v,"NTA.

That being said you need to be extremely cautious.

It sounds like your mom is trying to build up a justification to send you somewhere for ""troubled kids"".

As bad as it's going to suck you need to be the model daughter in all respects from here on out or she can basically pack you off to a terrifying conversion center, wilderness school, etc.

Toe the line until you hit 18 and do your best to save up some money so you're ready to leave as soon as you do.

After you're out of her house and self sufficient you can decide on your terms if you want a relationship with her."
cs39ux,Lol obviously nta. Just go. He is not committing to hanging out and likely isnt even sure if he actually wants to.

cs3fhj,"NTA, sounds creepy and if you don't want to see him you shouldn't have to force yourself
edit: spelling"
cs3kct,"You're NTA here. But I don't see ableism, just a low-blow insult. Ableism is discrimination based on ability. He's wrong to pull that shit out to try to insult you, he's definitely the asshole - it just doesn't fit the definition of ableism."
cs3mno,"Yes, YTA. It's like a week late? Wtf."
cs3q3x,"NTA. Holy shit. Sounds like she wanted a maid of honour so they could be the cash cow for a huge chunk of the wedding and celebration costs. 

I would look into taking legal action about this so you can get your money back. She and her family don't deserve to get away with that."
cs3r8j,"Taking away something you got for someone because they got it under false pretenses is fair, but obviously you should look into your kids grades. Seems like you took no effort to check and not that you were fooled by an elaborate forgery."
cs3tl4,"Alex Jones, really? 

That said, for the concrete situation you ask NTA. Couples need some time alone to be themselves and if you spent all the week together some time alone is necessary and good."
cs3u0o,"NTA, she needs to shut up and wouldn't take subtler hints."
cs3uzi,"This is a bit hard to follow -
NAH  for the first part - totally makes sense to not want to stay with an infant for a wedding you are all intending to party/ be loud at. 

ESH for the second part - he should have mentioned his gf was coming before agreeing to be part of the house and shouldn’t have assumed she wouldn’t have to chip in but you are making a huge deal out of someone you don’t know being there - it’s your friends gf and you said you all might be planning to party/bring people back anyways and you might not know them either"
cs40jy,"NTA, but you should probably have a frank discussion about your use of pornography within your relationship.

People's preferences aren't black and white. You're not required to like one type of thing exclusively, and being aware of that is an important part of being alive. You can be attracted to multiple things at once without being unattracted to your girlfriend, or not liking her as much.

Whether or not continuing to use pornography is acceptable within your realationship, or whether or not she determined that was unacceptable is another matter, my friend."
cs40q5,ESH- I feel like this is something you guys should have discussed before getting married and having kids. Religion can be a dealbreaker
cs45u0,"NTA 

You seem young. But I would talk to your mom about your feelings, and how you feel he treats you compared to your siblings,  and have her talk to him on your behalf. He may not be aware of how he's coming off."
cs4945,Just leave her stuff alone. You coming in and trying to change the way it’s always been is a huge mistake especially with a daughter. She’ll be off to college in a few years and it won’t be an issue. Her dad even says he just cleans around her so he doesn’t even want to push the issue with her. Unless you’re going for evil stepmom vibes just cool it.
cs4bxe,"NTA. 

Yes, infertility is a very sensitive subject with a lot of emotion behind it but this sounds to me like she is using it to get attention drawn away from you and back to her. Assuming what you wrote is true and complete, she is being the asshole.

Have a baby shower."
cs4eb5,[deleted]
cs4fum,"NTA - She has some nerve to unload her dirty laundry onto you, considering how things shook down with your parents. It is clear that she is insecure about her relationship with your father, and why wouldn't she be, when she cheated to land her role as his wife ?  This alone should make her think that when the going gets tough, your dad gets going, with someone else. All of that may be true, but she doesn't have the right to compromise your own mental well-being to assuage her own."
cs4ipp,"YTA. She’s “barely recovering” from a medical condition and all you care about is getting it in. She’s probably feeling super nervous about sex right now-not only has it been awhile but it will probably HURT HER and you told her to shut the fuck up and just take it. 

You absolutely should apologize, you ruined your anniversary but being an asshole."
cs4jhg,"YTA, sorry OP. He’s not obligated to get drunk with you or to “save” his drunkenness for you. I get that FOMO is a thing (especially with long distance relationships) but honestly this seems pretty controlling to me. To clarify, you’re not TA for being disappointed about missing out on that experience with him, but you are TA for blaming him and implying that he got drunk with his friends to spite you."
cs4nf5,"YTA

If your buddy acts like that when he drinks he has a problem with alcohol whether you want to admit it or not. Being drunk is fine until you act like an asshole like your buddy there and force other people to look after you and cause trouble."
cs4r5q,"NTA. And also it gives me an instinctive cringe when someone in their late 20s thinks it's ok to date someone who has literally just crossed the boundary into adulthood. Avoid away, indefinitely if you like."
cs4uq3,"NTA.  It's tough having a parent who is always negative about things you enjoy/ proud of.  But it's not wrong to call her out on it.  And ""downer"" isn't disrespectful (but ""stupid bitch"" is)."
cs4ux5,NTA even reasonable accommodations don’t include allowing someone to fuck up the work and be rude to coworkers
cs4won,WTF?
cs4wup,"YTA. 


Also, YTwrong. Your tone is very much ""this poor girl is misleading people about her professionalism"" which first, take that and shovel it into the hole it belongs, and second, is wrong. As in, you are incorrect. So unprofessional of you.

A ""professional"" is someone that gets paid for what they do on a regular bases. A freelance artist works for themselves generally on commissions. Sometimes those are from businesses, sometimes not.

You may not have been trying to be mean but you were diminishing her work, her accomplishments, and her honesty.

""Seek professional work and be a freelance artist and shouldn't continue to mislead people."" Yeah. YTA here buddy."

cs55vb,"NTA - this is incredibly immature and inconsiderate of your mother to do when you have neighbours. If she doesn’t have any ailments that make it difficult to get up and seek someone out she should do so. 

This may be a generational thing though and she might dig her heels in. My MIL doesn’t like it if there is a family get together and people split up- during a family holiday I went to lie down due to pregnancy aches and was told to come back after an hour. Even spending a little while in a bathroom without a shower running will result in her knocking on the door."
cs5g07,"NTA 

I went to a school with uniforms and they were about as equally strict. However, thank the stars, my Mom was a lot smarter than I was. The problem was I had no idea why I had to wear the uniform and there was no real reward for being uncomfortable. 

So my Mom sat down with me and we went over the rules. We went through my closet and separated my weekend clothes from my school clothes. My school required that I have a blue or black polo, the plaid skirt, tights or leggings, dark colored sneakers with dark laces or Mary Janes. 

So my Mom sat down with me and did a few things. 

1. We planned out the outfits together for the few weeks. She would have me try it on before school and we would see how it looked. She would ask if I felt comfortable or not. If I didn't like it, we would move on to the next option until I felt I had some control over it. 

2. We would lay out my clothes on a special chair with everything ready for me in the morning. She did this until I had an idea what I could and couldn't wear [about two weeks maybe]. 

3. She offered me an allowance for every day I wore the uniform. If I got good grades, I got paid. It was either in picking out a restaurant, allowing a friend to come over, getting to sleep in and not do a chore on the weekend, or picking a movie during movie night. She also would put money into my piggy bank if I did really well. But the rewards were things I enjoyed, because my mom was trying to show me that following the rules and doing well can lead to rewards. 

4. She explained to me what jobs required uncomfortable uniforms. My Mom worked as a nurse and she had to wear scrubs, which she told me she hated but got used to. She explained that she was required to wear three colors [green, brown, or blue] and could not have fun prints. Which she said was annoying because other people got to wear fun stuff. 

Anyways, I think there are things you can do to reward your kid for wearing the uniform. As an adult I wear my work uniform [office attire] because I get paid money, can use that money to do things I enjoy, and I am not homeless. So I think the best way to show your kid that she needs to wear the uniform is to explain to her adults do as well, it's a part of life, and if she behaves she will be rewarded in some way."

cs5j15,"NAH

observe his reaction when giving your dog treats. does it make him happy? if it does, it might be best to let him be. it’s probably one of the little joys in his day to be able to give the visiting doggies little treats, and it’s as you said your dog doesn’t eat them and he even gives you handfuls to take home — he probably buys too many to handle for himself. if it doesn’t personally bother you, I don’t think there’s a lot of harm in it."

>My reasoning is: I've already prepared a game for six, Miles had the opportunity to say he wanted to play on social media weeks ago, and, frankly, dude is a flake. Also, 7 people is a big group for one campaign. 

He's had a chance to indicate he wants to play, and didn't. You have got a group of six interested players and planned for that. And that is the reasoning you should put to him if he decides to take offence. NAH."

cs6k42,"NAH. You *were* understanding the first time around, but this time he got physically aggressive and presented himself as a possible danger to your wife and child. It’s a perfectly reasonable request and you handled it very maturely."
cs6luw,"YTA. He’s living his life in his own home, and everyone should be able to fully relax in their home. This discomfort you have with other people’s bodies doesn’t make you the AH, but attempting to use that to control his habits and comfort does. You say you’re uncomfortable in your own home, but he’s not actually doing anything to you."
cs6mkx,"NTA What an extreme over reaction. I'm not a Karen type or anything but I fully believe you should leave a bad review over being kicked out. Even people who are loyal to local coffee eventually need to grab a starbucks for convenience sake. What professional holds a grudge like this? You're the customer. It's not like you brought in a starbucks coffee to sit there at there table and drink it while you bought nothing.

It could be as simple as hey, I like the muffins here, but I like this drink at starbucks more than your coffee. It's not offensive. You can like what you like and buy what you buy. He needs to get a grip"
cs6ucn,NTA he asked for your opinion and you gave it honestly.
cs6y1z,"NAH - she clearly communicated to you a boundary because she wants the relationship to work. You need to decide if you want a partner that that's ok with always being on a photoshoot. If you decide it's not her, that's fine.

cs7a71,"NAH. It’s okay to be upset. It wouldn’t be okay to express it to your dad. And he’s not so cool for wanting med school over law school, but it’s his money.

At the risk of sounding super elitist, your chances of success depend on what you want to do and how prestigious of a school you can get into. Law is much more unfairly “pedigree” oriented than med school. Maybe after you complete law school and have a successful career lined up, he’d be persuaded to help out with loans.

Just wanted to say, I am a lawyer, and it’s not about the money. It’s about the satisfaction. I have have buddies from law school who make $300k+ and don’t love their jobs. I am a public defender and make pennies. There isn’t a single day I don’t love my job, 15+ years into it."

cs7hgf,"YWNBTA, depending on how you actually speak to her. A rational explanation for how her behavior has historically impacted you is warranted.

However, if you went off on her just for the sake of catharsis, you could potentially stray into asshole territory."

I mean... the fuck?    Who has the audacity to ask a coworker if their friend can stay with the coworker?    The people who want to stay with you literally don’t you know (unless I’m reading this wrong) 

Like... no.  Just no.   Who does that?    They can get a hotel or Airbnb or fucking camp or something. 

Just wanting to have your time alone would be enough to be not the asshole if you KNEW these people.     Given that they are strangers... you don’t need a reason to not let random strangers in your home. 


Is it your wife who is making you feel like an asshole?   If so, ask her if she would be comfortable if two random guys wanted to stay at the house when you were out of town.   (This May be taking it too far and probably don’t actually do it haha)"
cs7qhn,NTA. It sounds like this friendship is sadly one that won’t last the college years. So you don’t need to waste your last day before college with her

cs7whc,"NTA. I personally HATE people who do that. Private life is private life, and should stay at home. Not broadcasted to web so that everyone can see. Doing so opens up a whole can of worms, and is a very silly thing to do because it could always come back to bite the one who posts in the first place. 

If your SO is in need of friendly advice on matters, they should hit their close friends up and ask them for it by meeting up or calling them on the phone or something. But NEVER post it online.

Once on the internet, always on the internet. Never forget that."

And I’d have told you to spend some more time with a sleep specialist to try and figure out this issue. But as it’s too late now, there’s not much to do but try and power through and compromise till your kiddo sleeps through the night.

cs8tt3,"NTA. but i gotta be honest, as a woman, my guess is, she’s afraid if she is friendly, this will be misinterpreted as meaning she is inviting you to ask her out again, or even more that she is interested. her lack of friendliness is probably that she is uncomfortable with trying to figure out how to catch a ride, but not be misunderstood. it’s a fucked up thing, but we women are used to everything... a hi, a smile, eye contact, acting polite, ANYTHING being taken to mean being interested and she’s just trying to stay out of that place. idk that she is using you, but maybe just be straight up with her and say, “look i feel uncomfortable with giving you a ride, maybe just ask me as a last last resort. i’m not angry or upset or anything, i dont want to be put in a place where i feel like i’m obligated or anything.” and then just leave it at that."

cs9jed,"NTA he sounds like a shit player anyway. But you need to learn some dm skills and that means more than just the rules of the game. You need to be comfortable enforcing boundaries and especially setting up how the game will be played with your players before the game even starts — for example, if you tell them that all the characters need to be Good aligned for your campaign, they need to listen. And if this guy starts getting inappropriate, you need to put your foot down by using either in game or out of game methods — make the guards pretty strong, for example, so he doesn’t go around killing citizens. And/or tell him that there will be consequences for his characters anti social actions.  


Get some confidence, eventually you will be able to handle asshole players like this guy MAY turn out to be. One time I had to end an entire campaign that was 4 weeks in due to just one player being very rude to everyone else, both in game and out of game.  


In the end, stand up for yourself. If that means not allowing him in the game at all then so be it. You are the dm, you make the rules, and your main job is to make sure everyone is having a good time. Including yourself"

Your girlfriend is disrespectful. I don’t care what anyone here thinks: if my SO has slept with someone before, he sure as Hell better not be in contact with her now (currently single and probably will remain so forever because too many people are too lax about this kind of bullshit).

People just disgust me most of the time, I can’t help it. I’m not going to put my boyfriend in a position where I’m hanging out with some dude who had me twisted
into a pretzel doing unmentionable things a year or so ago. Why? Because it’s obnoxious and disrespectful. It has nothing to do with being insecure; it has to do with respecting your partner. Once you’ve had sex with someone, it’s crossed a boundary where, if you’re dating me now, she had better be a long forgotten memory and not someone you get together with for a movie, pizza, and a game of Cards Against Humanity.

I would have probably ended my relationship over something like that (not saying YOU should) because anybody who would be such an inconsiderate airhead is a waste of my time. You are definitely NOT the a-hole here; she, however, is."

In return for that trust and vulnerability, you grounded him for something he did two years ago--and extremely harshly.  The concept you're trying to pound home is obviously something *he has already learned.*

This is how you get him to never open up to you again.

I don't know how to really explain but I'll try.

You took a handful of situations and painted so many people as destined failures. I bet those two boys felt like shit that people who are adults see them that way.

There's a way to tell someone that their hard work will pay off by just telling them your experience instead of putting in other people's failures and assuming the reason for it. Especially if they were struggling with something completely unrelated.

Basically when you're trying to lift people up you shouldn't have to put people down.

csbkyf,"ESH. Go with me here since I know this is against the grain and it's not so much about you going.

Obviously, she's TA for saying one thing and expecting another. Expected in rom coms, terrible in real life. Case closed on that aspect.

Your role in this is problematic for a few reasons. One is prior engagements. These two events are relatively equal in terms of significance. You'd already committed to one, and you switched to the other. That puts you in dangerous territory. Bridal shower, to me, would imply that your fiancee is the guest of honor, but you'd be guest of honor adjacent. That would seem to make it an even higher priority and puts your decision deeper into the danger zone. 

Additionally, you asked your fiancee multiple times if it was ok. Regardless of what she said, the repetition makes it sound like you already knew the real answer.

Finally, your telling of the story makes it sound like you've abdicated all agency in this decision. You said you'd prefer to go to the shower, yet you ended up going to the bachelor party. Why? Was it because he worked harder at badgering you through your fiancee or that you can't convince him you can make the decision to go to an event for you that was organized months ago? (Side note: did you ever confront your friend about his text assault? You should have.) Third option is that you really did want to go to the bachelor party more but lied to your fiancee, which frankly seems like the most plausible option but shifts the decision to the friend while creating a whole new mess of problems. You suggested a compromise, which seemed like the best or at least a good option to me, but it was nixed because your fiancee, a person who wasn't going, decided that was driving too much. Where were you in the decision making process? I understand that we didn't get all of the details, but what we do have shows you coming up short a few vertebrae."

I really hate saying this, but for me, this isn't about kicking your Mom out, but for not directly backing up your wife as soon as there were problems.

Your Mother was being a pain in the ass. You constantly tried to make concessions for her and she failed them at every turn.

She openly admits to hooking, in your house, in *your bed*, as well as *stealing from you and your wife*. And when your wife tells her to get out, you actually back your Mom up.

What exactly is wrong with you? Your Mother basically betrayed your trust within the first two months of moving in. Even as you finally kicked her out, she was *still trying to steal from you*. And you still offered to give her fucking money.

If you bail her out now, that's not helping her, it's enabling her. Getting a second job to help pay for all the whishes of your financially irresponsible grown up child will not teach her anything.

BTW I am also one of those people, I literally dread a coworker meeting me ony way to work and having to have small talk in my morning alone time (alone as in not talking). Its not about you or them, some people need a lot of downtime from socializing and it just breaks my peace to be forced to have small talk (which I hate). I am an adult woman and talkative AT work so sometime is challenging to say politely that I don't wish to socialize all that much out of work - before or after.

It feels like both of you are managing the birth of your son differently; you feel like you've got a handle on things and there's a good routine, your wife feels like she needs more support.

Don't diagnose the PPD unless a doctor has. It's common, and of course not an issue if she has it, but it shouldn't really be up for speculation. 

Maybe have a conversation about why she feels anxious? Are there other solutions available? Could she go to a Mum and Baby Group, or a New Mother's Support Group, or perhaps just some baby activities like Baby Yoga or Baby Swimming?

csxu7u,"If you’re telling the whole story then ESH and your partner sounds like a monster.  Regardless, unloading on your partner in front of your mother is a big no-no.  

However, i find the way you tell this story to be incredibly interesting.  According to you, your mother is a saint who is bending over backwards trying to adhere to the unreasonable and militant demands of your partner.  You are selflessly attempting to support your partner in all her dictatorial awfulness.  It is nearly impossible, but you do it anyway.  

Despite all this, your partner still roars her fury at your poor mother, and refuses to even be polite or civil despite all the attempts to appease her.  Finally, you snap, driven to your wits’ end by the constant abuse. 

This narrative leads me to believe she is one of the worst people of all time, or suffering from a psychotic break. 

Things are rarely, if ever, that one-sided. 

I think the way you explain things is very telling. You clearly are harboring a lot of resentment toward your partner.  You essentially assign yourself and especially your mother zero blame. 

Ask yourself if you’re ignoring something.  Is your mom being silently stubborn about how to take care of your child?  Are you supporting your mom again and again and leaving your spouse in the awkward position of having to fend for herself with your family?  Are you helping with childcare when the moms are not there?  Or are you sitting back, pissy and pouting because your partner has strong opinions on how to raise your child?  

Your outburst is also telling.  I would never, never speak to my spouse like that in front of anyone, especially my family. That puts them in such an awful, lonely, outnumbered position. 

You need to think hard about the story you’re telling here and the one you’re telling yourself.  Try examining your own actions honestly and carefully and stop being driven by anger and self-righteousness."
csy1eh,"YTA.  I get your desire for quiet, but 9pm is fairly early honestly.  I'd try to talk to her to see if you can come up with a fair compromise, but I just don't think 9 is fair for adults.

But I definitely wouldn't say she is being unreasonable."
csy7ho,"NTA, nobody should have their personal space violated and feel uncomfortable at their school or place of work, and this is a lesson even classmates with developmental delays should be taught because it will serve them well in life. But I would mention it to your parents first, and if you have a teacher or guidance counselor you trust to take this seriously and not just dismiss your concerns, I would consider consulting with them as well. They might have insights about the safest and most effective way to get your point across, and also might be willing to talk to her or her parents on your behalf. But if adults are dismissive of your feeling that you are being violated, they are wrong and you should still stand up for yourself."

My mom makes jokes similar to that (about how I'd eventually inherit things she buys), but it's different when you're the one doing the buying and joking about someone else's death/expecting to get your gifts back. It's good that your mother doesn't seem to care about what you said, but I can't fathom being the one to make a joke like that about my mom. Even so, I was mostly with you up to that point because it seemed like you were only poking fun at yourself and not being serious about it.

However, the last few paragraphs about your justification for why your boyfriend is wrong and your mother would never give the jewelry to someone else totally changed my mind. It gave me the impression that you DO feel entitled to everything your parents have--not just the jewelry--and it wasn't just a joke you made to brush aside your mother's concerns and poke fun at yourself. What would make you less of an asshole is if you were actually just \*joking\* about your intentions, but instead you somehow thought what you said was more acceptable because it was more likely to be true? Yikes."

You should have made sure whoever is watching your child knows your child and your parenting expectations.  Based on your post I would have thought she would be fine on the couch as well... you literally said she would be happy to just sit and watch TV.  That to me implies she is fine to leave alone to make tea.  Clearly that was not the case. 

You know your sister is not a kid person, you really should not have assumed anything about what she would and would now is ok.  If your expectations were for her to not leave the room, you should have made it clear. 

Had you not been ""raging"" at your sister I may have gone with everyone sucks, but to get mad at her for doing you a favor, that she clearly indicated she did not want to do when all she did was fail to be psychic is frankly bullshit and makes you the asshole."

You're currently withholding that information from her, and springing it on her last minute means she wont have much time to process it and may make a sub-optimal decision.

ct2j6i,"YWBTA. If you want a place to stay that's to your specifications, go to a hotel. If someone is hosting you for free, you deal with whatever condition their place is in. If you can't afford the event *and* accommodations, then you can't afford the event."

if you personally dont want to celebrate things fine, but when you choose to have a kid it's not about you anymore. if, culturally, you never celebrate a certain holiday(s) that's one thing, but you're only opting out of it because you don't feel like it.

well, like i said, it's not all about you anymore."
ct2rsr,"NAH. Your intentions were good, but it's understandable why your uncle doesn't want a healthy rat in his scrap yard."
ct2sjw,"NTA.  The real losers here are the kids who are genuinely interested in learning art technique at at high school level and are ending up receiving an understaffed, special ed level art class, and the special needs students who need... SPECIAL EDUCATION... and instead are getting a teacher not trained for it."
ct2so3,"NTA. It would be for the sake of your sister. Especially if she's going through chemo, the last thing she needs is to be in an abusive situation."
ct2x2o,"It's not 1985, he's not dying. If he is taking his medication and taking care of himself, he will live a full happy life if he can get himself out of his pity hole. Dude needs therapy, not a friend telling him he's dying. He was out of line, but what you said was too far. ESH."
ct2yc5,"NAH

But I think that you two might be on different pages, relationship-wise. Many who have already reached the stage of living together just merge finances. Maybe he thinks since you're living together, it's no longer just ""my"" or ""your"" expenses. It's ""our"" expenses.

And if you're going to have a long-term relationship, that's typically the simpler, easier way to do things."
ct2ygm,Shit post take this down
ct33qb,"NTA, your dad is.

Also wtf is your dad doing your mum should be paying child support."
ct35gw,"NTA but I’m just gonna tell you no, getting married at 19 is a bad idea"
ct3edg,"If I'm reading this right, your mom took home something that was going to be thrown away home from her work and gave it to you, then after the fact, a neighbor who heard about it had a problem that it didn't go to her son? NTA if that's correct, the neighbor sounds like a r/ChoosingBeggars whose ears perked up when she heard you got something for free. If you wanted to give it to him that'd be fine, but you were under no obligation to do so."
ct3es5,NTA. That Shit is annoying and church is not the place to be doing that.
ct3ey1,"Big NTA. Is it really part of her personality to put others down? Where are the jokes at HER expense- or better, jokes without a victim? There’s a difference between light mutual teasing and constant put-downs; this sounds like the latter. You have every right to ask your friend to respect you."
ct3hm9,"NTA. You warned her. She played stupid games so she won stupid prizes. 

I also imagine she ends every sentence in, “Bless your heart.” I probably would have said, “Bless your heart,” and walked out of the room."
ct3jlq,NTA. Your aunt is horrible and your grandparents sound awful. Your doing the right thing.
ct3lhl,"NTA, you are not getting paid enough to worry about the team case load, your manager is (it's literally her job to worry about that). The thing is if it's really this bad you aren't the only one looking."
ct3nqx,"NAH - however, if he is concerned about sleeping in, can he set his phone alarm 5 minutes earlier than the new alarm clock?  That way when/if his phone wakes him up, he can get up and shut off his alarm clock before it goes off and wakes you up.  This way it is still a back up to ease his nerves."
ct3ohd,"NTA

His mom is fucking bonkers. Does he have good boundaries in place with her?"
ct3ohe,"YTA. I'd go back and check your script. If you called me, I probably would have responded the same way the woman did.  There was no indication that you were asking her to confirm anything."
ct3ryo,"NTA. That's literally not enough money to be worth your time. If she is that understaffed she should look at the way she is scheduling, which is also not your problem."
ct3t4s,"If you're not that close, I would say let it go.  You're right, for LinkedIn, you want your most boring professional headshot, but..  Telling someone that they are presenting themselves poorly is... tempting but not helpful unless you are close enough that they will feel comfortable hearing it.

YTA if you tell her how she should present herself without her asking for input."
ct3ugh,"NAH here. It's reasonable for you to not want to see them. It's reasonable for him to be excited and want to share with a friend. I doubt he was trying to punish you. It was an awkward situation and he may have felt guilty, though he shouldn't have. This may be a huge obstacle for a future deep friendship though."
ct3wz9,NTA.  He is making you do all the emotional labor by forcing you to decide these things.  You need to do some research into emotional labor and sit down with him and tell him deciding what to have is actual work and it is exhausting to do the planning all the time and he needs to step up.  Then divide up the days of the week and he is in charge of meals on his days - INCLUDING deciding what will be made for them.  I would look at if he is expecting you do all the other emotional labor in the relationship.
ct3y1s,"Easily NTA. I'm very pro-medical marijuana due to a severe medical condition I have, and I was about to suggest he just goes outside if he can't take a day or two off, but you already suggested that! The easiest and most obvious resolution. Weed smoke stinks up your house and isn't safe for children. They're delusional."
ct3z4m,"NTA - any discount would be a favor to her, and after ""cuntish"" you'd be justified in a 50% increase."
ct41fy,"NTA she’s not your kid, quit acting like it"
ct429j,"ESH. Your grandma sounds like she's not dealing with watching her husband disintegrate in front of her eyes, and you plainly yelled at her. Is she twisting words or is she trying to create her own illusion? Either way, she is making him miserable, and you upset her instead of just trying to tell her that what she is saying is not reality. I think you should have a sit down with her."
ct451f,NTA he shouldn’t sell it to you if he wants it for himself
ct49y8,"Easy NTA, the last part would be perfect if it ever came up. I'd go so far as to do a thorough cleaning because allergies might be an issue"
ct4b4i,NTA. You should get her name and put in a formal complaint with the airline. What she did was COMPLETELY inappropriate.
ct4fun,"NTA - He sounds awful and if you haven't told your wife about how he tried threatening to put your relationship on the rocks, you probably should, so she can better understand your reasons for not wanting to go. She might be upset, as she's still close with them and nobody wants to travel without their SO to a wedding, but she'll probably understand. She can always say you couldn't get leave and be civil to macho man.Congrats on your wedding, btw!"
ct4g8g,"ESH. Small culty ""new martial art"" dojo scare the shit out of me. Using high techniques on a junior student is shitty--but was your dad just upset that it was a technique from a different style? Being a pushover is shitty. Being a ""very aggressive"" martial arts master is SUPER shitty, once you're a teacher it's your job to know how to balance your ego."
ct4gv0,"NTA- She needs a reality check.

&#x200B;

Although, any chance when she talks about finding a women shes talking about herself?"
ct4qeq,"YTA for sneaking someone into your parents house that they specifically asked you not to bring. You are a minor and it is not your house. Yes it sucks that they won’t let your boyfriend over, but it is not their fault that you cannot go to his house. Try to arrange a situation where they can meet your boyfriend, like at a restaurant or something, and see if things change."
ct4y5s,"Edit: I received clarification so judgement time: ESH (my question is below as well as his answer)

Question: was your gf the manager when he ran the last scam? His answer was no, different store.

Explanation: Both you and him are this round's asshole. Mostly him but slightly you. 
Without a doubt you would be a major asshole for not saying anything, and you already kind of are for even having to question it. If your GF finds out that you even considered letting this slide she may not ever forgive you. This could easily affect her job and they may even try to make her seem complicit since she's the manager and didn't notice the scam that was occurring. Your friend is a massive asshole for pulling stunts like this while he has a family at home and considering this is his second scam I highly doubt it will be the last in his life. His wife deserves to know what kind of man he is and where his money is coming from so that she can decide whether or not to continue building a life with him. Let your GF know asap and don't give him a heads up as he may be able to twist things around to screw your GF over."
ct4yfy,NTA. It is not your responsibility to take care of her of her children.
ct4zn8,NTA. Its your choice who you want to have relationships with.
ct51qo,"YTA. I don't approve of your father's actions towards the waitress as it seems rather petulant, but you are ABSOLUTELY an asshole here. The way you talk about your father and his weight alone is really disgusting."
ct525m,"NTA. Your sister isn’t the asshole either, her sugar daddy is. What’s happening is he’s holding financial security over her in order to keep her all to himself. He is isolating her from her friends and family. It’s not supposed to be like that, he’s abusing her. You should make a post on r/relationships too for more thorough advice but you’re going to have to find a way to show her the reality of her situation. Any decent boyfriend would allow a brother to visit."
ct53hv,"NTA - It's not about her, it's about the health of the animal."
ct53zk,"YTA- Yeah, no shit he doesn't have conversation at the family game night - you're there. It's very problematic and you need to move on, politely decline and get out of his life. Stop it."
ct54ql,"NTA, but maybe just say you have a prior engagement or something."
ct563i,"NAH

This sounds like a miscommunication? You finished work early in order to maximise time with your SO (and still get your workout in). Would she have been annoyed if you finished work at the usual time, but skipped your workout? The result would have been the same."
ct59qj,"NAH. It’s fine for you to want to go abroad for 6 months and live out an awesome experience. It’s also fine and totally normal for her to be extremely upset about it.   
Long distance relationships are hard and a dealbreaker for a lot of people."
ct5i8i,"It feels like you just don’t want to go and are looking for validation from us to tell you that it’s ok to bail on your bf. Do what you want but in my opinion if you choose your friends, then it’ll be a great sign that your relationship with your bf is not working."
ct5ihc,NTA. I don't think your snap was that snappy; it just raised the emotional temperature up high enough to realize you were not joking. Jerry was clearly being an asshole by refusing to accept your polite requests that he leave according to plan.
ct5irz,NTA - They were defensive because you challenged their upbringing/parenting like they challenged yours. I think they pressed you to hard and backed you into a corner. They don't have a right to dictate how you feel about your childhood.
ct5nly,"NTA. You told the truth to the government. You’d be the asshole if you tried to cover up for him, not to mention risking your own freedom."
ct5nu3,"YTA. If you can't live with him coming to the house, you need to move out. People can be in a relationship and not live in the same place. Do not ask her to allow her mentally ill son to become homeless for you."
ct5ny6,"NAH sometimes it doesn't work out, that's ok."
ct5tg1,"I'm sure this isn't popular opinion, but NTA. The kid is old enough to make his own decision (and he did). You tried to accommodate as best as possible with what you had, and your sons friend wanted meat anyways. As a good host, you have your guest what they wanted."
ct5w8q,"YTA. Word got out that you don't tip, which is why the bartender pointed it out. You're right, you're not obligated to tip, but you're an asshole for not doing it.

Pro tip: tipping well on your first trip to the bar will get all of your drinks faster."
ct5wx4,"NTA. Let your son get his friend a gift to drop off at another time, and let them know you won’t be able to make it. No need to give a reason other than you have other plans."
ct66dd,NTA. If is your choice and your choice only on when you come out to anyone! Do it when you feel safe and comfortable and ready. Don't let anyone pressure you in either direction. Good luck!
ct66kz,"NTA. If they wanted you to pay for the advice, they shouldn't have made it available during an initial consultation. It's not on you that her legal firm overestimated the nature of the meeting."
ct67zf,"I think you know YTA here. 

Your dad is right. Boating can be extremely dangerous for people who are inexperienced. Also you lied to your father, causing him to lose trust in you."
ct68cs,"Yeah but he paid for the whole month... And if she politely explained her situation instead of insisting he clean it and let her stay and being an overall bitch about it, maybe he would change his mind."
ct6ayp,"YTA

Headphones are a thing. Are you seriously confused as to why someone would be upset that  you play music when others are trying to sleep?"
ct6eg5,You overreacted and put way too much pressure on this engagement in the first place. You wouldn't even accept an apology from a good friend. It's not some random stranger that you don't care about. You are potentially losing a friend over this. I would say YTA.
ct6h6z,"NTA

You had plans. They don't get to mess those up with little notice. Not to mention, since other people won't be able to make it anyway, it makes the whole exercise seem somewhat redundant, and I don't know why they don't opt for another time."
ct6htz,"NTA, this is a toxic relationship. Your mental health is suffering because of it. You give so many reasons to why he cheats, there is no excuse. I hope you can find happiness by going your own way."
ct6x7f,"NAH (or possibly NTA if your friends get angry about it). Seriously, your family should be your first priority, especially in a situation like this. And if someone will talk shit about it, they are not worth being a friend anyway. 
I suggest explaining the situation to your friends as you explained it here."
ct6xju,"ESH 

Guys, this is a marriage. You need to have each other’s backs and communicate and reevaluate if things aren’t currently working for you. He’s coming to you from a point of frustration and it sounds like you’re not effectively communicating yours. Eventually, both of you need to bend and find a good compromise. 


If time constraints are so bad, it shouldn’t be outside the realm of possibility to hire some help on the weekends (kids practices, etc) or for one of you to take up the cooking responsibility. There’s a compromise here, you two just have to work to find it. 

Maybe you do half meal prep mid week and he half meal preps on Sunday. That way you have fresher food and variety.

Edit: OP added their schedules for the day and I’m leaning more towards Hubby being TA while standing by my original comment. 

OP, your schedules and responsibility allocations are *extremely* off balance. I can completely understand why you’re like “fuck your dinner” now. 

I still think that you two need to really communicate with each other and think about reallocating some pressure off of you. You’re doing a lot of “trad” stuff while also working full time and paying 50%."
ct6zu8,NTA.  Telling him is the right thing to do.  YWBTA if you don't tell him IMO.
ct75i6,"NTA, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink"
ct781s,"NTA- you were using an illustration to try to make her see what an idiot she was being. Unfortunately, idiocy can’t always be easily cured."
ct7g9j,NTA. They want the fun of spending time with your son without dealing with the grumpy toddler the next day. You know what's healthiest for your son and you've given them other options if they want to spend more time with him.
ct7goh,"NTA

But for fuck’s sake don’t marry this guy. He sounds really manipulative and unpleasant. 

**He’s deliberately goading you into insecurity.**"
ct7hih,NTA. You did the right thing by reporting them. Say you didn’t and then later find out that they had gotten into a bad accident due to texting and driving. How would you feel then?
ct7l3a,"NTA. I'm honestly sick of parents that choose to have kids and then act like their kids should be grateful that they did their fucking job. If they didn't want to raise children, they should have made sure they didn't have any. Children don't get to choose who they are born to, and imo, children never owe their parents \*SHIT\*."
ct7ov4,"INFO: Would you still hang out with him if he wasn't trans?

NTA if yes, YTA if no"
ct7qpl,"NTA. You already did more than you needed to by reminding her three times. She wanted it all, now she has to deal with all the responsibility of it."
ct7r3a,"YTA - I mean, common. When you think something shitty, you're not an asshole. When you say something shitty, you are."
ct7snt,"NTA - This sounds like a one-sided agreement where he wishes to continue his fantasy of one-day being with you.  
If you don't have romantic feelings for him and/or don't wish to be more than friends it'd be best to make it clear so he doesn't feel like you're ""leading him on"".

I wouldn't say the drunk cuddles were leading anyone on unless this is a habit you have with only him"
ct7vle,"actually culture is huge when working in medicine, you still need to respect people. Medicing needs to be be holistic, people are complex and there is more going on than just the medical condition they have. You need to consider the big picture."
ct824r,"NTA. Not by a long shot. 
Those belongings were your mothers. Your uncle lied to you when you asked where her belongings were when he gave it to his daughter. Honestly, I’d be really angry too. They rightfully belong to you as your uncle has no say in what should be done with her possessions as they weren’t gifted to him at all. He claimed them by himself. Even though your mom died when you were very young, she is still YOUR mother and it’s items you can have to remember her by. Not giving it to you is pure assholery on his part. On the subject of your grandmother’s belongings, they were gifted to you by your grandfather who had every right to do so."
ct860p,YTA He could be bi or he could have been confused. Alot of gay people marry someone of the opposite sex because A. It's the social norm and B. Because it happens. Would you be acting this way if he was marrying another woman?
ct863v,"YTA. It sounds like a very useful gift, but taking the occasion of his birthday to remind him that his teeth are unsightly is just rude.

Does he ever bring it up himself?"
ct89fr,NTA buying a three seater couch is way more expensive than people realize a good one will cost at least 600+. If it bother your roommate so much maybe she should had bought the couch instead of you.
ct8d5u,You need therapy. This is absurd.
ct8dgw,"NTA
Your brother wants to plan a surprise party, and he has requested that you chip in. You have no obligation to do so, and the fact that you are even offering to pay half is generous enough. Your money is YOUR money, it’s up to you how you spend it."
ct8es5,"NTA. If he's going to hold a grudge over something as tiny as that I wouldn't bother even trying with this dude, Honestly this ""Best friend"" of yours shouldn't allow her boyfriend to bad mouth you over something so innocuous. 
I'd say just keep clear of both of them, People like this aren't worth the shit they make you deal with ."
ct8fh0,[deleted]
ct8hwb,"Yes, YTA. It was your idea to make it *and* to buy the fancy food."
ct8igl,"Your English is fine - with a western European swing, perhaps?  You speak like my Lithuanian family, it's like I can hear your voice, LOL.

NTA - if BF is so concerned, tell him to book his own hotel room in his name and then you can stay with him.  Otherwise, he has to ""roll the dice"" and see what happens.  He's being a big baby if he's expecting someone else to pay for him to have his own room."

ct8qvt,Sounds like you just need to talk to him one on one about it. Sounds like that conversation is a few years overdue. NTA.
ct8r7o,"NTA

I was about to slap an everybody sucks on this since a wedding seems like a weird time to start trying to change this sort of relationship with a 3 year old, and this likely impacted some peoples' enjoyment of the ceremony. However, it seems like all of this could still have been avoided with a little more parental intervention and boundary setting by SIL earlier, and I think it's unfair to ask you to essentially babysit while you're trying to enjoy a wedding."
ct8saw,"NTA and not even close 

As a commissioner myself, certain rule changes I feel I have the right to implement if I want. However, I almost always at least discuss it with the league and it would never fly to change a rule the day before the draft. 

This isn't a league you want to be in."
ct8uew,"NTA. If she's so wealthy, why on earth does she need a cosigner?"
ct8w0a,"NTA This is some sexist bullshit. Wow. Absolutely incredibly ridiculous. Would they ask a male employee to shave his legs? How is it unhygienic for you but not for any man who has leg hair? I'm honestly aghast.

EDIT: i didnt assign a vote"
ct96r7,"YTA. They pay for pets because they have pets. This roomie doesnt have a pet. They have an ESA. And you cant ask for pet rent for ESAs because they arent pets. The laws pretty clear about ESA rules. Theyre to help with this persons life (or in some cases make it possible for them to live at all), not for shits and giggles."
ct99sj,NAH. This is a bit over Reddit’s pay-grade. You should talk this through with a counselor.
ct9e6x,"NTA, give that dude a snickers and tell him to stop being a diva."
ct9ef0,"NTA If your cat is happy with your mom, being treated well, and you're ok with it then you're correct to keep things as is. Your friends who want to plan a ""heist"" are probably more thinking of what a good story that would be than you or your cat's best interests. Frankly your response to keep things as is sounds very mature to me."
ct9kph,"NTA, if she wanted to be a family she wouldn't have either agreed or asked for a divorce. That marriage is over and you don't have children together, it's time to move on."
ct9ona,"NAH you want to stay, your parents don't. Noone is an asshole here, moving sucks.

Pros and cons to moving though... You never know what opportunities you might get at a new school. New friends, new hobbies. 

Good luck"
ct9vs8,"YTA...Burritos are a beautiful gift from Mexico and should be treated with dignity and reverence until the point of consumption. 

You have committed a grave sin against burritos and must serve a penance of 1 burritoless year for every hour the handmade culinary masterpiece was irreparably damaged by your wanton misuse of fridge temperature, for a minimum sentence of at least 5 burritoless years, to be served consecutively."
ct9vyp,NTA. It sounds like there is more at play here than possibly you realize. But it’s completely fair for you to want your fiancé to contribute to the family.
ct9wil,NTA- funerals and memorials are for the living anyway. Just have your own moments silence for her. I feel like she would understand.
ct9x7g,"NTA, if she's not allowed to have him up there, she's not allowed to have him up there. I don't understand why she would clean it with that in mind. That being said I am a bit confused here. Do you also live in the home? If so how old are you? Why wouldn't you just buy a bigger mattress? Seems odd to me."
ct9y1k,"NAH. You're entitled to time by yourself. She is entitled to feel some type of way about it, because she's gone with you on this trip every other time. I think though that just talking to her about what you'd like to happen on your vacation would probably have been easier than disinviting her."
ct9yg3,"NAH. Your ex is your child's father. He is always going to be a part of your life, and as someone who knows him, you are far better positioned to say what kind of influence he will be on your child than your boyfriend. You are also allowed to have strong and close relationships with people other than your boyfriend, and to maintain whatever ties you need to facilitate a good relationship between your ex and your child. You have done **nothing** you need to feel guilty about.

THAT BEING SAID: I 100% understand where your boyfriend is coming from. Your ex has been in prison your entire relationship and it's starting to get close to the point where he will be released. Even a relatively secure person would wonder about his place in your life, and worry he might be a placeholder. You have an ex who you frequently visit, have a child with and who you divorced for reasons related to him going to prison in the first place - to a third party that could certainly come off as a being a relationship that's headed for another round, no matter how many times they're told otherwise. On this side of things, I think it's reasonable to expect you to do some hand-holding.

The child-rearing issue is much less his business, and I suspect it's probably more a rationalization for his insecurity than anything else. But if your ex is in prison for violent crimes, it's also not the most outlandish thing to ever pop into someone's mind."
ct9zow,"NTA it’s your home and you’re entitled to control who’s allowed to enter it. this guy sounds like he’s nothing but trouble, no one would fault you for saying no to him staying there."

ctaqck,"NTA. They wouldn’t leave their car parked hanging out into the street where cars drive, so they shouldn’t leave it hanging out in the bike lane. That could cause you serious injury."
ctar2v,It feels like the “irrelevant bits” may be relevant.
ctartp,"YTA. Whether she wants to leave him or not you are stressing her out by escalating things when you text her calling him an asshole. you made you not being able to sleep (due to your gaming no less) her problem and now she is in the middle and has to say something to him to get him to stop for you, likely causing discord. 

You could have texted her “hey can you ask him to stop singing cause it woke me up and I’m mad tired” or even have just texted or spoke to him yourself. Instead you added to her stress cause you decided to fix a sleep schedule that you messed up."
ctas4g,Why is there so many minecraft posts on this sub

ctav12,NTA. It’s never wrong to call out someone claiming combat duty when in reality they have none.
ctav5e,"ESH (I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that ""stuff really offensive to her which you won't mention"" = ""if I wrote it out it would end up convincing most of you I'm the asshole""). She's being a jerk. You were a jerk back. This is standard brother-sister stuff. But you might want to ask your sister what's up with her these days if this has been a recent development."
ctaw78,"NTA so my usual position on airing dirty laundry is do it at your own risk but since this sounds like a possible abuse scenario I can in no way blame you for telling your friend about it, or needing a friendly ear. 

In the future I would recognize that some things we keep to ourselves, especially when they involve others. But in this particular instance I think your right to have support far exceeds your relative's right to privacy."
ctaxb3,The reds and blues got a little confusing there in the third paragraph.
ctb4lg,"Do you even want an honest answer? I see you’re criticizing everyone that gives you a YTA verdict. 

IMO YTA, cause it doesn’t matter to me if your feet stink or not, if I’m sitting close to you and don’t personally know you I will be immediately grossed out at the sight of your feet - bare or with socks, doesn’t really matter"
ctb4ya,"NTA, you asked multiple times, making sure you had approval before taking action. If both kittens are happy and healthy then there’s no problem here. Sounds like that lady is just over reacting.."
ctb7cy,"I feel compelled to say YTA though I do emphathise with your anxiety.  Your text was exactly what I would send someone if I arrived at a meeting point early so that they could join me when they were ready, and there was nothing ambiguous about her text.  To be surprised after that is forgivable but to say she was inconsiderate and get hostile? That’s too much."

ctbc0l,"NTA. If your mom has control issues, this seems like a good time to be drawing bright lines with regards to the fact that you will not tolerate those control issues when it comes to your kids. In this narrowly defined circumstances it might seem heavy-handed, but I think in the long run y'all might be better off."
ctbdwq,"Yes, YTA if you involve yourself at this point, unless you tell Jill you are going to.

If you tell her, and then put everyone's cards on the table, I think you may be less the asshole. This doesn't mean you should do it, because it isn't your relationship.

If you tell him without giving her a heads up, you are very much interfering in not your business land. 

Maybe their relationship will survive, maybe it won't, but if you stick your nose in to it there is a much smaller chance your friendship with him will survive no matter what happens."
ctbhx5,"NTA they gave it to you and didnt ask before selling, who does that??? its like giving your friend a cookie and getting mad they ate it. What if you didnt have it ? what would they do? Do not give it to them."

This would be stirring the pot for no reason. I unfortunately started smoking as a teenager as well, and though I regret it, nobody could've stopped me. He's probably heard millions of times that smoking is unhealthy, and made the choice to start anyway, so there's nothing you can do. Let your parents enjoy the last couple of weeks with your brother without letting cigarettes steal the spotlight"
ctbm8y,"YTA, not for not inviting him but for inviting half of the small office and then repeatedly talking about it in front of the other half of the office who weren’t invited. You don’t “have to like the people you work with” but then again that wouldn’t be a problem if you were keeping your conversations professional rather than personal in the presence of those coworkers whom you don’t like."
ctbq1w,ESH he didnt have to call you names but i certainly dont think his actions warranted that kind of retaliation.
ctbr6q,"YTA. I assume you mean Asperger's?

Either way, you sound like someone who copes well enough to not just hold down a job, but have a high level position at said job. There is no reason why you can't extend that to helping out at home.

Make a checklist. Ask your wife everyday. Set reminders on your phone. I get that it might not be easy, because I struggle with executive functioning as well, but you can find strategies to help cope and meet your family's needs."
ctbt9p,"NTA. I might be alone on this, but double weddings have always seemed a bit creepy to me- don't you want your wedding to celebrate you and your wife, not you and your twin? It's perfectly reasonable to want your wedding to be about you and your relationship, not the fact that your brother is a twin. If having a ""single"" wedding is financially feasible, then you're not an asshole."
ctbufk,I think that sounds incredibly sweet. You wouldn't even be close to being an asshole.
ctbuju,NTA - Your nephew is not your financial responsibility. Your child is.

You hit at it in your post in fact. This isn't some vital and important cultural practice, it is a practicality born from the realities of plumbing in some parts of the world. You didn't single anyone out, you approached everyone, and it is a health hazard. You did everything perfectly right."
ctbxf4,Sharing helmets is a good way to get lice. NTA the kid doesnt have to share if he doesn't want to. The FIL should collect the bike and helmet and keep it close while your kid plays so no one tries to ride off with the bike.

You're both entitled to like/love different things. Just because you're together doesn't mean all of your interests need to be similar.

ctclh6,"Unpopular opinion, but NAH. You are not in a relationship with this person anymore so you have no say with whom she hooks up; nor do you have any say with whom your friend hooks up. 

However, one cannot fault you for being upset. Lots of unresolved feelings do that. Also, while I do not think your friend was TA, what he did was careless and unwise considering how recent your break up was. You should talk with him and express how you feel (without outright blaming him - people respond very badly to that)."

ctdenr,"NTA

You will be voted TA because this subreddit has a tough time differentiating ending a life before it begins and pretending a living breathing, child doesn't exist. People also can't understand how giving a child up for adoption to loving parents and intentionally depriving them of one isn't the same. 

If your value system tells you that abandoning your child for simply existing is wrong then it's totally fair for you to stick by those principles. Your own son is 22 and a parent himself despite his best wishes. You've done your best to raise a strong, thoughtful man and something went wrong along the way. This baby doesn't have the same opportunity to learn from his dad so I think it's more important you focus on being a wonderful and loving grandfather."
ctdiix,YTA if you have a child with this man.
ctdj2c,NTA - For sure your sister is on some sort of superiority power trip and you are correct in shutting it down.
ctdkac,"NTA - Sounds like Sam might fancy you based on his actions and how he treats (neglects) your other male team member. But that doesn't give him the right to overstep personal boundaries, or to basically harrass you with his phone calls, texts and presence. I would talk to Sam about it, calmly, professionally and clearly so he understands how his actions are making you feel, what actions are acceptable, and that if his behavioir towards you doesn't change that you will have no choicr but to take it to the HR department. So don't delete any of the calls or messages he sends or has previously sent, as they can be used as evidence of his actions."

Your parents need to stand up to this bitch and stop enabling her bullshit. She became like this because they let her. Even when they see how it affects you, they do nothing. Maybe instead of trying to plan separate trips, they should have put their foot down with her a long time ago, and then you could all go on trips together. Your parents need to get some spines or something. Christ."
ctdwz7,"NTA, but am I the only one that thinks it’s weird that you mentioned that they are a black couple?"
ctebay,"NTA. He did ok until you told him who the owner/creator was. At that point he should have changed credits with a link to their site.

What is best is a ""share"" from the official website so it's clear who's the owner of the content, as opposed to reposting. Artists should be creditted and get paid for their work. Reposts don't help them, liking and sharing their sites instead can help generate add revenue or attract patreons.

It's safe to say the artist intended for this comic to be shared a lot online and inform as many people as possible, but credits should still be given."

ctf3cw,"There is a bit of a line between you being 'sexualized' and you wearing inappropriate clothes to inappropriate places. If I go to work wearing a corset with my tits under my chin and get pulled in by HR, am I being 'sexualised' or am I being inappropriate.

Your friends were not being particularly nice and if you know it's appropriate and they are just being jerks then do what you want. Above knee pencil skirt is a slight oxymoron. If it is a short bodycon style tube skirt that sits more than a hand (long ways) above your knee, then maybe keep that for weekends."
ctf3m2,"NTA 
People who were telling you off should've given up the seat."
ctf58n,I would say YTA but she specifically asked you for some flowers which do not cost a lot at all. A gift isn’t about how much money you spent. Why didn’t you just get her the flowers?
ctfaye,"ESH. Look at the fucking screen. Except for the noise, they weren't doing anything that should have been an issue for you.

The 'inverted slur' concept is fucking stupid. Fag is an offensive term.

The gay guys shouldn't have been laughing at inappropriate times during the movie, but you guys could also have told them to be quiet and otherwise minded your damn business.

And they think you're homophobes because your friend used homophobic words and you're here trying to justify it."
ctfblt,Nta get him kicked out for Noise disturbance.
ctfofj,"NTA. You owe them nothing and the notion that they're relatives so you have to care is BS. You've done nothing wrong and given everything you posted these seem like selfish, uncaring people and I wouldn't wanna go to the funeral either."

ctfxcb,"NTA

She couldnt have it, why does that mean nobody should have it?

Its nothing to do with weight, it could've happened the other way around but they had size 14 instead of 8 and I can't imagine you would've been mad."
ctg1f7,NTA - You are not being an asshole however quitting a job in hopes of getting another job with no proper salary promise might not be the best move for you financially.
ctg3dp,I think still kind of YTA but if I was your roommate I would think this whole thing was pretty funny and laugh it off. Though you should have bought the same kind of donuts (looks like Boston cream which is objectively the best kind of donut and a regular frosted donut does not compare.)
ctg44u,"YTA and your friend is TA as well, stop using ""gay"" and ""virgin"" as insults even if it's joking. 

You two might agree with each other that it's ok for you two, but using these words in public does affect other people who might not be ok with it.

(edited away the E S H because the other party is not the friend but the other guy who got offended and he is not an asshole)"
ctg4i3,"ESH.

In a world of billions of people, you have to befriend the ex of your alleged “best friend”? I can’t stand people who do weird shit like this. 

Your friend is an a-hole because she threatened violence, but I understand her anger (although that doesn’t make it right). You are being weird and you know it.

Here’s an example: An acquaintance of mine recently broke up with her boyfriend of years. I was good friends with this acquaintance in high school, but we rarely see each other now. I used to know her boyfriend (through her) and he was on my social media. He recently started messaging me and asked some “getting to know you” type questions. I shut that shit down real quick by giving bland, basic replies. He’s an attractive guy and possibly my “type” (smart, funny, creative, etc.) but I have no interest in crossing that kind of boundary and doing that to my old friend.

There are lines you don’t cross and you’re crossing them.

EDIT: Why are you going so far as to hang out with this dude who you claim has another romantic interest anyway? Sounds to me like you’re carrying a torch for him or trying to spite your friend for hanging out with people you don’t like.

FYI - Your friend having other friends you don’t like is not the same you as snuggling up to her old boyfriend, just so you know."
ctg4y3,"NAH. They have good intentions, but they're not thinking this through. You're right, there are better ways for you to spend time with everyone. You should offer suggestions on fun things to do locally instead. After all, who wants to spend your last moments at home away from home?"

ctglfs,"NAH.  Hosting events and holidays is expensive and time consuming.  If hosting the holiday always falls on them it’s only fair to contribute.  Sounds like they put a lot of time and effort into a well run and organized holiday and while they enjoy it, you’re still benefitting from it.  You too are incurring expenses traveling there so I see where you’re coming from. Talk to your sister and try to come to a compromise."
ctgnst,"NTA.  As a boss and, I have a rule that I don’t connect to employees while they are in my reporting structure.  It protects me and them!  You can invoke the same rationale or say nothing at all."
ctgnx2,"NTA. You should have put the ""meth"" thing at the top of the post, because we didn't really need to know all the other stuff! 

However, I wouldn't wait and then lie in front of Hailey. Send her an email or something to say you heard she's trying to track you down to invite you to a party but given her history with meth and the fact that you won't be able to supervise, you're just not comfortable letting Hailey go.

ctgx01,"> We pay for it so we have a say in it. 

YTA because of this.

I would normally say not the asshole, because no one is going to die from eating healthy and skipping meat for a single afternoon. As a dedicated meat eater, as long as the invite made it clear what to expect I would be fine with it. That being said, if your family is paying, they absolutely should get a say in what is served."

cth3yn,"NAH. You're not necessarily the asshole for wanting to sue the landlord, you want a safe to live in home. What you need to do is give him the chance to rectify the problem, that could range from putting you up somewhere till it's fixed, or even letting you out of the lease and returning the security deposit. If the landlord does what he needs to do to make the situation right and you still want to sue him and eventually do sue him you'd be the asshole. 

Now if you present the problem to the Landlord and he continues to not do anything to fix it then he would be the asshole and you wouldn't be. Right now this hasn't really reached the point of there being an asshole on either side. What happens next could change it though."

$0 is not a price. A lot of theater events do a 'name your price' night and I've seen people pay as little as $1 to see a show and that is fine because you're right, there are people who will donate more to make it accessible. But it's pretty entitled to not try to pay anything at all."

cti1k1,"YTA. I know you're a nice person trying to be nice. But I've been through this with my dad, who always insisted on paying when he went out for coffee or a meal with friends and family. I told him that if he *always* insists, it comes across as heavy-handed, and makes him look like ""the guy with the money."" It can actually be a little humbling for people if you *never* allow them to pay, because it looks like you think they're too poor to show you hospitality and kindness.

What I typically do instead is let others pay occasionally, thank them warmly, and say ""I'll get the next one."" And when it's your turn, be generous. You could even send them a card or something to say ""thanks so much for treating me to the movies, I had a great time."""
cti73f,"ESH. I agree that she could have tried to help out when you were struggling, but she decided not to and I can see why you would be upset by that. However, in your case, everyone was healthy (though stretched thin) and you would make it out of the hard times soon. Your sister was nervous to take care of a newborn child and, while I think she could’ve tried, it is a lot to ask to take care of a helpless baby and she wasn’t ready to do that. 

For her situation it’s much more life or death. You’re upset for her not helping out with your baby, but her husband has cancer and may not make it out of this situation. Do you really resent your sister so much that you wouldn’t help her in this truly awful time of their lives? I think you should discuss with her how she hurt you when you asked for her help and she said no, but I think that helping her in this is so much bigger."

It's normal that your mom doesn't want you majoring in theatre since most actors don't make it and you don't have to major in theatre to be an actor. 

You're terrified of computer science because you *think* you took a class in it once? I'm not sure what could have put you in sensory overload since gaming is way more sensory intensive than programming.

Computer science starts at the beginning and assumes 0 knowledge. You don't need to know anything about programming before you start your first class. However, if you like gaming, you might like modding games. That's programming right there. If you've ever messed around with HTML or CSS, you've used some of the languages used in software engineering.

However, you need to be excited about your potential major so if you don't want to major in CS don't do it. Look at other majors. If you hate looking stupid in front of people, you definitely shouldn't be a theatre major."

Her: I have work commitments that also prevent us taking a honeymoon, also it means we won't have as much time to plan, also moving it will cause me more stress due to reasons stated previously.

You: I think my reason is better because my family said so.

It's hers and your wedding, not your family's or your guests - Friday is also quite popular, so it's not like you're doing it on a Tuesday.  Also - did you already send out save the dates?"
ctiztw,"NAH. That's 3 hours driving time per day, on top of the 8 hours he will work, assuming it's a typical 40 hour work week. I think that's an unreasonable distance to ask someone to commute. I definitely understand not wanting to uproot your life though.

There may be a better compromise to be had that you guys just haven't thought of yet. Perhaps you move closer to his work but travel into the city on weekends. Maybe there's a town nearby his work that has cheap regional flights into the city. If you two want to be together keep discussing it, don't assume that there is no better answer, work it out and find something that will allow you see your friends while allowing him a reasonable commute time to work.

Edit: YTA to NAH."

ctj918,"NAH. Honestly, I’m glad you are being conscious that you need to make sure both your children feel loved and important, even if one needs more attention on a day-to-day basis."
ctj983,"NAH. I might suggest a direct but kind conversation asking her how you can be most helpful when she’s upset. Does she want advice, or for you to listen silently, or to simply offer her love and support? That might help as perhaps she continues to discuss it because she’s not getting her underlying need met. You may be approaching these vent sessions differently than she is.

Second, I might suggest she also begins to journal or find a way to cope with these feelings. I can speak from experience that it’s hard when you’re going thru something and need to talk more than others are able to listen, but you have to find ways to talk to yourself too."

ctjjzx,"NTA.

It's common courtesy to move so that other people can pass you, _especially_ if you're blocking the whole damn sidewalk.

ctjp3n,"ESH. This situation could’ve been handled much better. 

She sucks for verbally inviting you and then not following up.

Your bf sucks the most for not finding out if you were actually invited when she sent out save the dates/invitations."
ctjpcx,NTA. What you did was the decent and right thing to do. Though i probably would have buried the cat somewhere and not taken it to a landfill. That kind of bothered me because taking something to the landfill means it's trash and anything that lives is not trash.

ctlm5r,"just a tiny bit YTA

some people just don't like their picture taken, and you are doing it without asking.

also, in this scenario they don't know what you are going to do with it. you knew you were merely telling a friend ""look at this crowded train car,"" but if you were a bigger TA it might have been something like ""look at how this loser on the train is dressed""... they don't know which, so it feels mildly uncomfortable and antisocial.

the ratios will vary in different cities, but you should expect that the train will be full of a combination of: 

1. people who don't care

2. people who care a little but don't think its worth mentioning 

3. people who care a lot but wont say anything

4. the occasional person who cares a lot AND calls you out

you finally met someone from category 4, you saw some nods from 2s and 3s.

you are probably a category 1.

i guess im a 2, so im only telling you cause you asked :D

its fine that you personally don't care... but you are a little TA if you don't care that some people DO care."

If he’s overweight and has skin folds, he possibly doesn’t wash and dry in between them properly."

ctm3jp,"Absolutely NTA. When you love someone, it is horrible to watch them suffer. It is totally normal to be relieved when a sick, elderly person passes away. Her pain is over now. Your sister probably just overreacted because she is grieving too--it can be hard when family members grieve differently."
ctm7ti,"I'm going to say NTA.

It really does suck for the other kids, but guaranteed it will create further resentment from them towards their mother. Good.

ctmabh,"NTA

I say this as someone who has breastfed, I’m definitely for the feeding of babies wherever those babies are hungry/not having to hide away in ‘feeding stations’ etc.

You asked her a favour having not seen your parents in years, she agreed, and then did the opposite to spite you. Her argument about it being an asshole move on your end to even ask her doesn’t line up because all you asked her about was doing the same thing she already does in front of her own parents. It’s not hard to do a little turn, get set up, and cover a bit when you are in the company of people you know would otherwise be uncomfortable and *those people matter to your SO*. We do these things all the time. It’s like dressing up for different events, it’s not a hill to die on. The big problem is when you are respectfully breastfeeding a kid somewhere and people get all up in arms about it being obvious the act is occurring. 

Your parents are on the line here too though. They choose to stay away and not see their grandchild because of this."

If she is trying to queue up plan details, then yeah prompt communication is better.   If it's just casual chatting, it can wait.

His dad isn't going to hear what you have to say and have an intellectual conversation about it, so don't bother. If you do try to bring up anything, find a time when he's sober. Even then he probably won't want to hear it but you have a better chance of getting through to him.

You made the choices you made for specific reasons. That was YOUR mom, and how much you love her can never be replaced or anticipated by other people. 

Also, you are a mother and have to be there for family. I’m gonna assume your mom would want you to do that.

I believe it sounds like this person who is homeless is already looking out for the dog if they were willing to let your friend care for the dog for 3 months. It seems like they already have the dog’s best interest in mind. Many homeless people have pets and would gladly feed their pets before they would even feed themselves. While this person isn’t doing well financially and struggles to feed themselves, do you have proof that the dog is being mistreated or neglected?

This person is already struggling with homelessness and likely doesn’t have much of a support system. This dog might be one of the few things they have left or rely on for emotional support. Tearing the dog out of their possession  unexpectedly through legal work and microchip registration is a pretty shitty thing to do.

Finally, just because the dog escaped and got out doesn’t necessarily mean they are a bad owner. From personal experience, I’m a great owner who spoils his dog rotten, but I couldn’t help that a fence plank got loose the other day. I’m lucky that my dog didn’t go far, but it goes to show that shit happens; it doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor.

Does your friend *really* have concrete proof that this dog is mistreated? Or do they just assume they can ‘give the dog a better life’? 

Why not just *ask* the owner “Hey, would you like me to take care of dog to alleviate your finances and potentially give dog a more stable home?” At the end of the day, if the dog isn’t being neglected, it should be the owner’s decision on whether to give the dog away."

He's a teenager. His interest in maintaining contact with his parents is going to ebb and flow. You don't need to feel bad about being discouraged by that.

This kind of situation IS weird, and while I can understand that his helicopter mom may have been overstepping her bounds after he moved out and this was the compromise they came up with, your Boyfriend needs to set some firmer boundaries for his mother. You are not out of line for saying so.

I don't really think the Mom is TA here. She is uncomfortably clinging to her son but she wasn't rude to you or made any comments about your relationship with her son. It seems like she's an empty nester with nothing to do and is using these chores as a method to cope. It's probably not healthy but I'm not a therapist."

I think ending a friendship of over 10 years over not being able to go to their home is a little ridiculous. This is more about the girl than anything. 

I feel like she doesn’t want you over there because then he won’t hang out with you as much so she has him all to herself. That is very bad, very controlling behavior. 

You need to have a talk with your friend one last time, WITH the girl. Go over there and talk to them together. Explain what’s up and tell them BOTH you can’t continue doing this with the girl acting like this. Your friendship will probably end that day as your buddy has already chosen this girl over you, but at least you can feel good knowing you went down swinging. No one can tell you you didn’t try or didn’t communicate."

However, if you do well, you have to consider what could happen down the road. What if you push your market and this side job really takes off?

You crashed a callback you weren't invited to and just because you had worked with the company before you were able to work your way in. It's not fair to the people who were properly prepared for their audition.  No one else got a second chance and you just worked your way in.  Congrats on getting the role/understudy but doesn't it not feel the same as if you had just worked for it without using a shortcut?

Honestly, I've seen this happen so many times it is really frustrating to see.  Usually it's because they are friends with the director or other production staff that they are able to get a role. The people running these show complain about the strain their friends put on them to have a good role even if they don't deserve it.  I'm not saying this is exactly the same situation as what you're describing as it's a company with people you knew, but it's a similar idea.

That person shouldn't have told you and thought about the possible ramifications, but they also probably didn't think you would be taken seriously since they didn't originally give you a callback in the first place. Especially if this is a paid gig, it's really not fair to the others who put in more effort initially, and you are sending a message to others you might work with in the future that you are above whatever system that's in place."

Life happens - this is your girlfriend’s family and it was clearly important you be there, it’s not like she’s always asking you to do this (I’m assuming). You should’ve cancelled."
cu4dyw,"NTA It's frankly odd that no one has spoken to them since it isn't a shared driveway. This should be pretty straightforward ""Hi Neighbor, I know you've gotten in the habit of parking in our driveway, but that inconveniences us. Please do not do it again. Thanks."" Keep it polite, smile, but don't leave any room to argue or debate."
cu4e9d,Holy shit $46 for a 7 min haircut? NTA idk how it works in America but those are normal tips for us in the U.K.
cu4e9j,"NAH

Since they are coming in from another country, can you assist them with finding childcare during the wedding?"
cu4gd2,"NTA I have people like this in my life and it's incredibly draining. My personal tactic from here on is to apply a 50/50 ratio to these conversations. I am not a wall to rant at, I want to have a conversation and I have emotions too."
cu4hdc,"YTA

Is this your first job? You're lucky you weren't fired, especially since the president had to talk to you about how hierarchy works. Yes, people of a higher paygrade get people of a lower paygrade for the tasks like this because their time is more valuable than yours. Get used to it."
cu4j31,"ESH. Did you really have to throw it on the floor? Couldn't you put it aside and leave a message asking them to not leave it for weeks there before they write you for being passive aggressive and throwing it on the floor? They are also shitty for leaving it, but you could have dealt with it better. You could write that letter to them now, but you won't have a good relationship down the road."
cu4k3t,"YTA. 

Look, I'm also bi. I have also been in hetero relationships (which are still hetero *relationships*, even if one or both members are bisexual), and I understand that struggle. Constantly having to come out and being recloseted by society. Friends and family and even other LGBT people minimizing your bisexuality because you're ""basically straight"" because of your primary relationship. Feeling less accepted as part of the LGBT community, and simultaneously like you're hiding a part of yourself when mainstream hetero society is always assuming you're straight. &c., &c.

Those struggles are all *very different* from the struggles of someone who is in an openly gay relationship, and they are *particularly* different from that of someone whose *family* is not accepting her *fiancee.* Telling your friend that they're the same just minimizes her pain, and makes it sound like you're appropriating her struggle for yourself, because you're ""both LGBT"". It's an asshole move."
cu4kez,YTA. You say you won’t abandon them but that is essentially what you’re doing by leaving her alone to take care of your child while you’re away at school. Your excuse that mothers are better at parenting is really piss poor as well. Why can’t you go to school nearby so you can help take care of the child you created?
cu4kps,"NTA 

You are not the asshole due to the following:

a. They are being assholes for saying bad things about your future

b. You are entitled to your own opinion. 
 
c. Seeing you’ve worked hard to move there, you likely are passionate about it. Your family should be encouraging you."
cu4lep,"NTA: your reply was mildly saucy and in no way majorly disrespectful or justification for him to lose his shit on you in that totally in appropriate way, though curling into a ball is a rather dramatic response on your part. 

It sounds like he is either a little unbalanced, OR, there has been a constant flow of little disrespectful jabs thrown his way day after day and he has lost his patience about being treated that way. Without more information for context it’s hard to know."
cu4moi,"ESH— you should’ve been direct, and asked Joe and Mary if they actually said those things about you. Whether they admit it or not, if you still truly believe they said those things, tell them you weren’t going to go to the wedding. The fact that you purposely waited til the rehearsal without even confirming they said those horrible things makes you suck too— like why would your cousin ask you to be a groomsman if he hates you and your wife so much? You should’ve confronted them and asked them directly. But obviously, if they said those things, they are ABSOLUTELY assholes, you are completely justified in bailing on the wedding, and cutting them out of your lives completely."
cu4mxb,"NTA! That girl is nothing but trouble, was probably never even pregnant in the first place. Seriously, Matt needs to get away from her. You’re doing nothing wrong here."
cu4njo,NTA your friend sounds like a drama queen.
cu4ptk,YTA- every generation freely uses curse words- not just yours. Most people learn when it is inappropriate. You don’t know this yet because you’re young and older generations were considerate enough to not swear in front you as a child- enough so that you think this a ‘your generation’ thing.
cu4swo,[deleted]
cu4twh,"You said stalk bro, you immediately raised the alarm on yourself lmao"
cu4v2y,"NTA- I would tell her that she’s being unreasonable. It’s your house too, and you’re allowed to shower whenever you want. I would maybe talk to your other roommate as well."
cu4xix,"YTA. Only like 2 lines of this was about your brother. It sounds like your primary motivation is to piss your stepmom off because she’s a horrible person. Something small to honor his love for anime would be totally appropriate, but a full blown cosplay ... when you know it wouldn’t be taken well by other non-stepmom mourners ... you’re not the only one who lost a loved one."
cu4xm3,"The only way I think YWBTA is if they asked multiple times and you never responded until it was time to go. If you don't want to switch, just be upfront. If they asked several times while you kept saying no, then they're TA"
cu4zry,"YTA

Not because you dont want to move. But because you agreed to it, the backed out citing that ""moving in the next 5 years"" is too soon? I'd say thats a pretty generous window. Your response wasn't constructive, you were using things you knew would hurt him as weapons because you were upset."
cu5084,YTA. I mean yeah I guess you don't have to but I don't see what the big deal is. When I was in college it was pretty standard to help our a roommate if a girlfriend was visiting or something.
cu51yr,"NTA

You should always involve a 3rd party with work conflict situations to cover your ass. Be diplomatic and report facts, not feelings. Make sure you're approaching the correct employee for reporting this behavior, it may not be the director, but that depends on the structure of your business. 

It's generally wise never to approach the employee you have complaints about directly, especially if they're your superior."
cu55cs,"YTA. He’s not just the boss. He owns the place. He can do what he wants. Ask him face to face about what to do in the future if you want. 

Let it go."
cu56qa,NAH but shoot Justin a message and let him know so he can make alternative plans.
cu5ake,"NAH.  I don't think it is stepping on their toes or too close.  The only concern would be if family is traveling to be there, would a month apart be difficult for some (expenses, hotels, etc.)."
cu5azq,NTA. That comment was a hideous potpourri of racist and condescending. I wouldn't hesitate at all to escalate it.
cu5bge,"ESH - You knew that tuna was for the cat. Your girlfriend had it for a legitimate reason - animals will correlate things with reward, aka, training. And while one circumstance may not prevent the cat from catching rodents indefinitely, it’s not worth the risk.

Edit: Eh, I’m changing to everyone sucks. Thinking about it, I wouldn’t make an SO go out and get it right then and there that early, either. It’s one mistake, you apologized. The cat won’t be automatically untrained without one can of tuna. But she does have a right to be ticked, I know I would be."
cu5csx,"NTA

obviously, tell him in a way that isn't condescending, but make it sound like you're giving him tips."

cu5epd,"YTA - This woman is getting a divorce and her own son won’t attend her birthday, which has only 4 people going as is. However bad you got it, it sounds like she’s got it a bit worse mate."
cu5mcb,"NTA. Girls pull that all the time. Just be firm, especially since she just wants your attention and already said it won't go anywhere.  


Source: Am girl. Was a dumb teenager that took hoodies."
cu5mr2,"From what you've told us, Marcy seems like a bad friend. I think the best way to go about it would just lay out what you've told us (nicely) to her and say that if things don't change then you need to prioritize your health and well-being over the ""friendship"". overall NTA I think"
cu5p7o,"NTA, they’re not above the rules, so they deserve the consequences."
cu5tij,"YTA.  It is not your wedding to remember, it was hers.  It would be tacky and thoughtless to ask her for pictures of something that has ended for her.  If you don't want to bring it up to the groom because it is painful for him, why on earth would you think it is okay to ask her?"
cu5tyc,"Holy punctuation, Bat Man.  This is nearly impossible to understand.

Then you shouldn't have entered into the designated driver pool. Short straw, tough luck, get over it. Sober means actually sober."
cu671u,"NTA but I wouldn't take his money, or even have him at your wedding at all. Even 'just' the cheating on your mom part was enough for me to say this."
cu68q5,"Obviously NTA, and if he puts his hands on you again call the cops on his ass."
cu69fr,"NTA. You’re going through it girl, he should want to be there for you. His reason for not going should be understood by his work friends. You should not be put through anymore than you already have. Definitely not the asshole."
cu6axd,"God YTA for staying in a relationship with someone who said they love you when you don’t love them. 

Jesus. You think *she’s* manipulating *you*?!

Buddy YTA."
cu6j1h,"Nope, NTA. You didn't hear back for two months and took care of yourself. No apology necessary."
cu6l7v,"NTA

People don't understand how CPS prioritizes cases. Taking the kids is their last resort, not the first. They generally will try all kinds of plans to prevent the parents from losing custody, and if they do lose custody, they are given clear steps to recover the kids: mandatory counseling, addiction treatment or attendance at AA,  regular urine testing to demonstrate drug-free living, visits from social services that can help a struggling parent understand access to food, utility help, help available at schools, etc. I knew a social worker who visited at-risk parents and gave them earpieces: she would listen to them interact with their kids and coach their parenting and communication skills from another room.

CPS doesn't want to take kids. They want to identify risks and mitigate them. Call them."
cu6pe8,Tell her you’ll do it if she shaves hers off. “Just try it!!”
cu6q1v,"NTA

Only because “sorry guys, have a slip n slide event to go to” sounds like a silly email to colleagues/students. 

Seriously though, no one is entitled to your time."
cu6rmn,"NAH both ideas sound reasonable. You expressed your argument calmly, and her reaction seems unjustified. However, she is probably frustrated either that this is even an issue, or that not enough appreciation has been shown for the fact she will pack for everyone (I’m assuming)"
cu6vmb,NTA-but yikes. It’s gonna get messy.
cu6voe,"NTA, family members who say ""Family is Forever"" are usually emotionally manipulative people in general."
cu6yp4,"NTA. Tough time or not, this girl is flirting with your boyfriend and he is going along with it. My bf had a situation like this with a co-worker years ago (would worry about her eating habits at work while I was severely eating disordered for years).  After she flirted with him right in front of me I told him to stop talking to her or I was done.  He thought I was overreacting but agreed.  Months later she was texting him asking him on a date, to which he didn't respond, and he realized I was right."
cu70jl,NTA - it doesn’t sound like she texted you and you ignored her.  Then you’d be the asshole.
cu72iy,"NTA, but you're not his mother.  You can express your concerns as a friend, but you don't get to make decisions for him."
cu793y,"NOPES NTA at all!!! Kudos to you for donating your birthday. 

When I was on facebook for bd's i donated my birthday to the free morgan foundation and center for whale research.

And thank you for being THAT teacher who made the extraordinary  effort to ensure your kids got the best you can give them.

not only are you NTA but you should mirror a gofund so that we non facebook users can also donate <3

teachers like you make all the difference <3"
cu7a6m,"NTA its not your job to wash her clothes, but on the rare occasion she does do laundry don't expect to get yours done either lol"
cu7aar,NTA. You don’t need to be friends with her.
cu7csi,NTA. Might wanna get a tubshroom though....
cu7gos,"ESH Except the dog, it's not the dog's fault.

My brother has a tiny food stealing, whiny, yapping, room pooper too. I'm working on training him, and I take him for a seperate walk because he can't keep up with my dog."
cu7h0j,"Families get weird when older people with property die. 

Sorry for your loss. 

You seem like the good person here. 

Ignore the drama and grieve"
cu7h6e,"NTA. ""Forced fun"" and leaking of work time into personal time sucks."
cu7itc,"YTA. Kinda. It seems like she enjoyed you and your husbands company, had a bad day and wanted to drink a little but didn’t want to be the only one drinking. Unless she planned on drinking without you there, going to a bar or something like that and I’m on your side. The initial reaction makes sense but I would think you should’ve reconsidered after a week or so."
cu7jib,"NTA - he is disrespecting your property and taking your generosity for granted. Being your significant other doesn't give him automatic right to use your things flippantly. I don't like that you are worrying that YOU'RE the one being ""bitchy"". There's something wrong with that. It also sounds like he is not contributing his way generally in other parts of the relationship and your living situation, which I think is adding to your understandable resentment. You are probably very stressed and feeling unsupported."
cu7na6,"NAH

I honestly think your roommate is just trying to be generous, considering you both have work statuses. Maybe he wants to be more charitable. But in that case, he can take the rent discount and use the $50 saved to donate to his own charity. It's just that I don't think he's necessarily doing it with malicious intent."
cu7odx,[deleted]
cu7ppa,"Assuming I'm reading this right, YTA, but mainly to yourself, because that is a SPECTACULARLY bad reason to turn down someone you are interested in. Just so awful. Really, really bad.

You're not going to get less scared of starting to date again by not dating people with whom you have a mutual attraction, and she already knows you're a DoorDash driver in your late 20s. Go back and ask her out. Happiness is not this difficult."
cu7rkh,"NAH. I can understand both sides. Is it possible to take half of your time to spend by yourself and relax, and the other half to focus on your marriage? Both are important and need attention. It's not bad to want to focus on yourself for a bit, but that should hopefully lead into putting in the extra effort into your marriage to strengthen it."
cu7sn5,"You’re NTA for thinking this is ridiculous and not wanting her to stay, but at the end of the day it’s not your decision. You can’t force her to not stay there if she decides she wants to."
cu7tko,"NAH-it may be kind of awkward but if his wife chooses not to pass on the information you don’t lose anything. If she does you could gain a relationship with your dad.

Edit: phone had decided does should be dies and my tired brain did not catch it."
cu7tqb,"NTA. An inside military joke is constantly saying TYFYS - thank you for your service - as a sort of mockery of how often people say it and the service members who demand it. 

It's a job. People get paid to do it. Some do it well and honorable, others less so. Glorifying the military doesn't, in my opinion, really help service members or the world; it just lets politicians pretend to be patriotic. Anyway, that's my rant, but I think it's gross for someone to go around demanding to be thanked like that."
cu7ujq,"NTA. Those three week ribs should've been in the freezer if he was planning on delaying their prep, and you saved your family from some rumble n tumble."
cu7w6r,NTA. 10-15 min max at another person’s house should be appropriate for most people.
cu7we9,"NAH

She is clearly in an abusive situation. For those who haven’t been there, it’s really hard to understand why people keep going back or why they stay. It’s a mess, really. And it sounds like she’s in trouble and could use friendship right now. 

However, You aren’t obligated to be friends with anyone. But on that note, she deserves to know exactly WHY you would not want to continue being friends and have the chance to either explain or change. Don’t just ghost her."
cu7xzx,"You are wise based on experience, you are NTA."
cu82na,"YTA. You should have just told her you didn't feel comfortable with them and wanted them deleted. I would be upset if someone just deleted shit off my phone.

But also, just tell her not to post them on social media... if she's keeping them just for herself, who cares?"
cu82va,"I was on your side until that edit, so ESH. I've been married for a long time, tell my wife everything, and that doesn't shock anyone in my family or friends. If they want to talk shit about her, they're smart enough to do it between each other and not to me. Me wife and I keep each other's secrets, not other people's.

But if I knew some one was talking shit about her, you better believe I'd keep that person out of our lives until they apologized. You're all young and still learning how to adult, but c'mon, your sister trash talked your relationship and you're going to let her slide AND invite her to celebrate that very relationship?"
cu85ss,YTA. This isn’t a situation that will happen more than once. You can suck it up and support your husband in the death of his grandparent...even if it *gasp* interferes with your birthday or sick days. Do the right thing and hold him up. Be a friend. Be a shoulder.
cu86vl,"NTA -  ""That we are not children anymore and should stop acting like it.  \[...\] She starts  calling me ungrateful and saying how we don't love her and that we  should respect her opinions and stop being so childish."" Right. You're the childish one for not being willing to be internet friends with her on social media..."
cu8cj2,"Well on the upside it sounds like you won't need to be cutting any more onions for your girlfriend lol.

1. She asked for help and you half-assed it. 
2. You were actively trying to one-up her on being tired from work, you don't have a monopoly on that shit.
3. Learn to communicate without yelling you giant baby.

YTA"
cu8duv,Nta she's using you as her personal shopper and doesnt want to pay. Tell your husband to suck it up and let you use the money you had saved to pay them back. I already annoyed by your mil and I don't know her.
cu8e3x,"NTA. I don’t want to hear anyone of any size complain about their weight, especially in the workplace. People need to realise no one else cares."
cu8fi0,"NTA. Maybe he’s not even getting married anymore. If it’s your boyfriends birthday, you should probably make plans to do that so you have an out when you find out Saturday at 1 PM that you’re supposed to be somewhere at 2 PM."
cu8gaj,"NTA. You cut her off for a reason. r/JustNoMIL (they accept Mom posts, but also she is your SO's MIL) , r/JustNoFamily , and r/RaisedByNarcissists will have support info for you"
cu8hyg,"YTA your parents literally bought you a car, a luxury about 95% of the worlds population don’t have access to. They’re right in saying you’re being ungrateful, you need to grow up a bit and appreciate your parents more because as you get older you’ll realise how important they are"
cu8k9d,"NTA - If it was indeed that bad, and his driving was no better...he deserves to be reported."
cu8ka1,NTA. I ignore people who accost me while I am going about my own business whether that's in a store or on the sidewalk. If they decide to get rude with me I lay into them. They are the ones bothering me so they can shut the fuck up on calling me rude for ignoring them.
cu8png,"NTA. Sure you could have asked, but it's not unreasonable as a roommate to quickly make use of something like a coffee pot. She's wildly out of line with her overreaction, and if she tries to pry another apology out of you then you should firmly tell her that you've apologized enough and the topic is now dropped."
cu8rl4,"NTA

You have enough to deal with being a pregnant teen. If this girl is jealous then she is an idiot, because your life is about to get *very* hard. And I agree about gender reveal parties."
cu8uub,"NTA - it sounds like she can't stand being called out on her shortcomings (i.e. allying herself with a brute and not coming to your defense). If you cut her out, she'll know why."
cu8vlr,"YTA. That’s her family and her culture. Fun fact: Hispanic actually just refers to a person who speaks Spanish as their first language, though usually also aligns with ethnicity. So she’s not even wrong from that angle."
cu8xh2,"YTA for thinking that she owes you something and that the leftover booze is payment. Pretty sure she doesn't give a fuck about you or the booze.

Keeping the booze because it's there and she's not coming back for it wouldn't have made you the asshole."
cu8yzn,"Without seeing the message themselves I can’t say for sure that you would be being an ass. What I would say is when Hannah texts you say something like babe Hannah is having some trouble again, she says x, what do you think I should say? I want to be a good friend.

cu8z7o,[deleted]
cu91ow,NTA. She got issues...what the hell...
cu97a1,"NTA - In my opinion saying ""that's enough"" cant even be considered scolding. The kid probably told a fake story and his parents believed him over you. You did nothing wrong in saying that to the kid, and i think its absolutely how one should discipline their child."
cu97gj,"**NAH**

>I would let this go if it were something cheap

cu97xt,"She's not his girlfriend, she's his date for one night. Alot of people confuse dating for a relationship. Your allowed to date multiple people as long as your not in a committed relationship. NTA"
cu99wc,YTA. You should have asked. Part of a marriage is about trust and you already lied to her. You need to reevaluate your lifestyle choices if it makes you steal from your life.
cu9auf,"ESH, but hey, maybe you got your point across. If not, I think your next step is to involve police and such."
cu9e60,"NTA, but don’t be surprised if she doesn’t check with them personally."
cu9fnz,"Yeah cut this shit off now. YTA. She has a boyfriend and you're nothing more than a sounding board at this point.


I dont get why people think getting into relationships with coworkers is such a great idea. Every place I've worked at has put a ban on it because it brings in unnecessary high school type drama to the workplace"
cu9g66,"NTA you sound like you have a child living with you, not an adult. Change the kitchen stuff back to yours (and leave hers in boxes by the front door) and tell her to get the hell out."
cu9leq,NTA. Animal cruelty has to be called out. And eff that employee for brushing it off like it’s okay for kids to go about killing goldfish.
cu9njl,"NTA - it's not yours to loan. If the coach wants this other girl to have this varsity piece then they should go through the school, not you."
cu9odo,"YTA for wanting to audit child support, but your boyfriend would be NTA for wanting a firm court appointed amount.  Asking for random amounts doesn't seem sustainable. Child support is supposed to account for loss of income due to constraints of caring for a young child, not just 'kid stuff'."
cu9psa,"Yea, YTA. Sorry, but one of the biggest traits managers want in an employee is someone who fits in with the culture of the workplace. If you reject it and refuse to interact with the team, it's gonna come back to bite you. It's just the way things are, and sometimes it can even get you fired or refused jobs."

cu9vqd,"NTA - Every weekend seems like quite a lot, when do you go and see your family? 

Could you compromise and go every other week instead, staying in and doing activities you really enjoy the next weekend? That way both of your needs are taken into account and if you see his family a little less you might actually enjoy it when you get there.

If he isn’t willing to consider your needs that is a massive red flag and you need to either go to couples therapy or really think about your future together."
cu9y7u,"NAH. I'm not gonna disrespect your family as it sounds like they're very traditional, but why wish away your happiness to please them? They may be bothered by your decisions, but they do not have to live with your partner. You do. Do what's best for you. Hopefully your parents and the rest of your family come around once they see you with a good person who makes you happy"
cua527,"NTA. You're an adult entitled to make your own decisions. If you are not comfortable meeting this lady, don't do it. If they ever do become exclusive and you think that there is a future with that relationship, then maybe consider changing your mind but it's still your choice"
cua6rs,"YTA if you tell her friends, that’s 100% something she needs to do on her own. They can’t do much to help her and I know I personally carried a lot of shame about my depression as a kid; people knowing about it was literally my biggest fear and it sounds like she feels similarly. 

However, *if* her mother understands that depression is a real thing and got her sister help for it, telling her is the right thing to do. Your friend will absolutely be mad at you and may not forgive you, but she’ll be getting the help she needs and that’s what matters."
cua79r,[deleted]
cuabg3,"NAH I think. Unless of course, you had already accepted the job and resigned at your current one, and put a downpayment for the place to live. Then you’re NTA, but that information isn’t very clear to me. 

You’re feelings are valid, you were looking forward to something and almost had it, and it was taken away. Your partner’s feelings are valid, if this is a big opportunity like you say it is. Honestly, whatever compromise happens, someone is going to lose. Good luck, and I hope the discussion that arises from this has a good result."
cuad6z,"YTA.  Lashing out at overworked, underpaid fast food employees is a dick move, but good on you for apologizing."

cuak46,"I'd say NAH, but it is a nice gesture to have a meat option, or at least a fish option."
cuald6,"NTA, but I'm at a loss for advice to add, because you're dependant on him. Try talking to him calmly and explaining that you feel disrespected when he tells embarrassing stories about you, and especially when he calls you named in response to you losing your temper.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
cuaydf,"NTA. You already do far more than I would consider necessary, but more importantly, you don't want to and that's all the justification anyone needs to do/not do anything like this."
cuayv1,"NTA.  In addition to being incredibly rude, this guy is a danger to your kids.  No way in hell would I let him near a child."
cub0yl,"NTA

You told him him not to be disturbed during calls several times in a very calm way. In this situation I find your reaction justified if he hasn't learned his lesson yet. Moreover, though you snapped at him, it doesn't seem that you insulted him."
cub8ls,"NTA. Sounds like they're extremely overly sensitive. Better environments are out there. That's ridiculous. You apologized, and that should have demonstrated you're able to adapt to the conditions of the house."
cuba8n,"This sounds like a rant rather than a situation that needs judication on assholishness. BTW, you are clearly NTA."
cubd61,"YTA if it's something you knew she was embarrassed about, why talk about it? Could have just told your daughter your side, without bringing up why your wife was there"
cubdpz,"NTA for wanting your dad to help you. Based off the fact he is MGTOW, I would 100% try and do it yourself. You've travelled loads and you can absolutely do it. I was recently in London and found it really easy travelling around using the underground. I understand having stuff on your mind makes small tasks seem a lot more daunting but it can be hugely rewarding managing things by yourself. It's not intellectually lazy either, you are asking for support."
cubdwf,"YTA, you can’t ask people to move when they’re in an area where smoking is allowed and legal. There’s one of you, and four of them. If you’re that uncomfortable you move."
cubf0j,"NTA, I would check with your local DMV and if you can bring a doctor’s note that talks about your condition. The DMV should be able to tell you if you even legally qualify to drive. If not, bring back literature explaining this to your parents so they understand you’re not being ungrateful, you are being mindful of the potential your condition has when behind the wheel."
cubf6r,In that case NTA. They are not respecting your boundaries and medical privacy. I would advise next time just not tell them beforehand so you don't have to deal with this. But I'm guessing you've already figured that out.
cubfg5,"NTA. Physical or not, you are entitled to your own body and your own privacy. It doesn't matter if shes your mother. If you want privacy, she should give it to you. And it's not normal for getting yelled at for locking a bathroom door wtf."
cubhqw,"YTA

My gosh 2 years later and you're still angry for someone giving you a gift?! You need to work on both your resentment issues as well as accepting gifts as a decent human being."
cubkxh,"NTA x 100, you got this lady a designer watch and she is crying over a cake. A cake most people would be happy with."
cubq3j,NTA it is common courtesy to offer someone food if they come over *regardless of the time of day and gender*.
cubr2z,"NAH - Taking care of the sibling would be a life-long commitment that would obviously cause some stress in your relationship.

I understand your reasons for why you describe the sibling as a toddler but at the end of the day, he does need help.

Speak to your SO about this and come up with a plan for if/when the sibling does need help and make it clear you have serious concerns over being the full-time careers.

Good luck OP"
cubu9y,"YTA

I don't see why it matters if she was involved or not. He planned this gift for you and needed help getting it done, so you decline it just because his ex helped him out? Bro. Be happy your partner was thoughtful and went and did something stupidly sweet."
cubwgi,YTA. Anyone saying otherwise is morally bankrupt. You are helping expose this man to STIs and keeping info that is greatly affecting his life. A decent person doesn't sit on that shit.
cucbyh,"NTA.

For whatever reason your mum is being very unsupportive of your sisters relationship. You are doing the right thing."
cuccru,"YTA

>But she doesn't seem all that ill, she sleeps quite alot and it's been mentioned her weight changes rapidly and she's a bit all over the place but really she could be working.

This isn't your call to make. Someone (presumably a doctor) has signed her off unfit. You're in no position to judge or question that."
cucej8,"NTA, it could be part of a scam to call you up later when they're just ""a few bucks short for the hotel, and you were soooo nice before"" since they now know that you'd go above and beyond to help strangers.

Or not. But in any case, I think you did the right thing."
cuckpt,"NTA, my god, if you can’t care properly for the dog in the first two weeks then you’ve no hope, it will only get worse.  Poor dog deserves better"
cucyds,"NTA.

You did her a favour and now she's used to having it and has done nothing to resolve her issue."
cucz2s,"YTA. He knew her order and was being friendly, because that's literally his job. Apologise to your girlfriend for your insecurities and also the barista next time you're in there for acting like a dick."
cud1b9,NTA. He most likely has the money or he wouldn't have sent it to his gf. Sucks you had to go through this
cud2tk,"YTA. Like a major gaping open wide A. Your father made it very clear that he wanted nothing to do with this man. Your father knows who his dad is, it's the man who cared for and loved him."
cud60g,"Roundup can kill the entire plant, not just the part of it you spray. That's what it's designed to do.

You could have talked to the neighbor asking hi to cut back the vines. You could have cut back the vines more agressively. YOu needn't kill the whole plants. Especially if you're risking property damage in the process. 

And lastly, the vines were all on his property anyway? None of your business if they are. He's not obliged to put the fence right on the border and you're not entitled to ""care"" for his property on your side of the fence, *especially* not with something that can cause damage to other parts of his property as well.

YTA"
cud9qg,"YWBTA. You didn't like it when your bike was messed with, why would you go messing with a stranger's bike?"
cud9y1,"YTA You're using this poor guy as your emotional crutch and then flying off the handle when he doesn't want to be.  It's a lot of work to support someone and it has to be something you want to do, not something someone else forces onto you.  He probably has his own shit he needs to deal with, give him space."
cudaoe,"YTA. Not for asking, but your mentality screams entitlement. It doesn't matter how he got it, but its his snow blower. Just because you believe that family should better each other (which I believe too), doesn't mean that he should give you things for free just because you want it."
cudbqh,"~~NTA~~ NAH. I'm surprised they can't invalidate the ticket remotely. Did they honestly expect you to show up ONLY so you could pay the 700 bucks they forgot to charge you? ""Better luck next year!"""
cuddpf,This is beyond the scope of Reddit.
cudfru,"YTA - jesus.  How pretentious do you have to be to think that because *you* edited the photo, it's perfect and everyone has to like it.  God forbid they take THEIR photo because YOU gave it to THEM and edit the colors.  Get over yourself already."
cudizk,[deleted]
cudz5w,[deleted]
cudzgt,"YTA of course. Just add fraud to you criminal record, why not?!?"
cue1pp,"This isn’t an AITA thing. You need to go to r/relationshipadvice . It sounds to me like you guys need to sit down and talk through things and renegotiate some stuff. 

Maybe it’s time to switch up the routine and do some other things rather than the same thing every night."
cue24s,"NTA. OP, I'm in a similar seat. I was abused by her boyfriend and she's been denying it for nearly ten years. Only a few months ago did I cut contact for good, after multiple attempts at ""talking sense"" into her and presenting her with evidence only to have it be shut down as nonsense. Don't be like me and put yourself through unnecessary suffering. Cut it quick. You owe her nothing for her putting you into this world."
cue3x5,[deleted]
cue3zs,"Just an update to the situation, I contacted one of my RAs and they said that they are not allowed to prevent us from showering or using any other amenity in the bathroom, especially if they're in use. There are no designated showering or cleaning times, our janitor just kind of comes whenever."
cue4st,"YTA     

I assume you knew ahead of time that 1. you were moving and 2. your work schedule. You should’ve requested the day off work to allow for moving-related stress/problems. You should have also already figured out the public transportation schedule/route provided you knew where you were moving/location of work."
cue52x,"I told them if my task A ""isnt where they want it to be"" then I'm not going to do task B so I can focus all my energy on task A stuff and improve. They said ""well the company still needs B done""....I said ""then the company needs to pay someone to do it"""
cuebn5,"YTA only because it'll be harder to get him to stop when he's older. You're basically rewarding him for swearing, and it's super funny and cute until he swears at a teacher or another kid and gets sent home from day care. I just think you're doing the kid a disservice by not properly equipping him for interactions outside of the family, where people won't find his potty mouth nearly as endearing"
cuedgc,"I mean ywbta yes, its nearly always the evap system, just tell her the truth"
cueg14,"He might've been your father but he wasn't your daddy. 

NTA.

Edit: thanks for silver :)

Edit2: omg thanks for my first gold :D"
cuepw1,"Update: I have acknowledged that I am the asshole in this situation and have asked her if I can still go to work tomorrow, to which she has agreed. We're both happy and no one is the asshole anymore. 

I would like to thank you all for widening my view on the situation and I would kindly ask that I recieve no more comments about me being the asshole."
cuett6,"NAH

He isn't an asshole for asking (although he has been a big flake), but you are not obligated to keep a spot for him indefinitely.  The train has left the station, no assholes left behind."
cuexxe,"NAH

I don't fault your father for being abrupt with a solicitor.  While tempted to say you were an asshole, after some thought I am not willing to label courtesy - even if somewhat disloyal to your father - as asshole behavior."
cuez2q,"NTA. That'd annoy anyone, regardless of sensory disorders. If she's so anxious she needs to be going to therapy to find better coping mechanisms. It's your house and you've done more than enough to try to help. Do you rent/is this also bothering neighbors?"
cuf0fm,"NTA. It's your property. There's no speed limit on private roads, and your neighbor can stay off your land if he's worried about you endangering him."
cuf1xi,"Definitely NTA. If you broke up with him and he wanted to stay that would be a different situation. Maybe even if it was a 2 BR place. But a one bedroom apartment that you don’t feel comfortable living in, no way I’m paying for any of the rent. 

You offered to take over the apartment alone. I’d tell him he either takes that deal or he can pound sand."
cuf2vl,NTA. Vacation time means you don't have to answer them unless agreed upon differently before leaving!
cuf38w,"NTA - your mom’s mind is just stuck in the past of 15-20 years ago when merchants used to be hostile to the use of cards for small transactions

These days, it’s just an accepted cost of doing business, and if a place really cares, they’ll be cash only or give you a discount for cash"
cuf460,"NTA: he said he didn't feel like he was going to settle down for ten years, but also wanted you to predict he'd go back on that and let you him know how you felt about her moving in? That's BS."
cuf86p,"YTA. You knew she wanted a big milestone celebration. You didn't have to do much, but taking her out for dinner, cooking for her, or a picnic would have been nice. The cake could have been planned better. It's the small things- a little dazzle dazzle."
cuf8nd,[removed]
cufa6s,"NTA

A lot of creepy would be well served by someone politely calling out their inappropriate behavior. Many are just clueless and a few gentle nudges can get them to stop being creepy."
cufabl,"NTA.  You set a boundary, and you enforced a boundary.  That's exactly what you're supposed to do with people that try to steamroller over your needs.  Good for you for standing up for your kid."
cufbce,You’re not the asshole for having a differing opinion. You ARE THE ASSHOLE for hiding it and making some weird childish ultimatum instead of discussing it more with her like an adult.
cufghy,"ESH

Just to be clear, your actions are toxic and qualify as abusive. You need to get out of this relationship and really do some soul searching about who you are.

To be clear. His actions are also abusive and toxic. Generally, the person in a relationship throwing about accusations of narcissism is the actual narcissist."
cufnxi,"NTA. Is she a princess? Is she a toddler? If not, then she can tie her own damn laces and brush her own hair. WTF."
cufqrd,NTA. Be honest with your girlfriend about what the doctor told you.
cuftzq,ESH - you are not her manager and therefore you should have brought up your concerns to her manager.
cufu39,NAH but you're probably over thinking it.
cufyq8,"NAH. I was in a similar situation. Don't be to hard on your parents or yourself. Your parents were worried because they knew you had been gone for a while. When you live alone, your parents just don't know when you're out. Now they know, and they will worry again, as all parents do."
cufzgi,"NTA 

Offering to put them up for a month rent free. With the only conditions being chip in with house work and dont eat your food are reasonable requests."
cufzm7,NTA. You shouldn't have to associate with her if you don't want to.
cug0ks,"NTA, LOL she is pretty generous with other peoples things, but not so generous with her own I see. Whatever reason you had the steak, it is not her place to dictate to you on what you should do with your items (whatever they may be). If she feels so strongly about it she should buy him food herself. Oh and happy birthday to your doggo :)"
cug3sa,"YTA 

Because this is either a shitpost, or you are willingly dating a manchild, bringing misery into your life."
cug52e,"NTA

You gave solid advice. If he's pissy he can't have a gaming laptop in college that's on him."
cugaxn,"NTA, I don't think. Not learning someone's name properly then telling you to get over it is neither professional nor kind."
cugc6x,"NTA, because:

>I told my husband he'd have to eat vegetables if we have a kid as I want our kid to eat them and it will be hard to get a kid to eat vegetables if his dad refuses. My husband agreed.

If he wants to have a kid he has to act like an adult. Time to pay the piper."
cugcob,"YTA

>Cause its alot of travel and petrol to sleep here and spend every waking moment there to come back to sleep and repeat. **I understand she misses her mother dearly when shes away** but I know for a fact I'll just be reserved to listening and trying to cheer her up for the next few days and wouldn't mind the time tonight at least to relax a bit.

If you can't see why YTA after reading this then I don't think anyone telling you here will make you see it. You're putting your own tiredness and the _cost of petrol_ over your girlfriend's emotional needs.

You're in a relationship. You support each other in the good and bad times. If that means you don't get a full night's sleep or do things you wouldn't normally want to do, that's a compromise all relationships have to undertake."
cugcta,"NTA. They are lying in one way or another. If they did have the dog at point, they neglected it or it’s been gone a lot longer than they said. Or they never had the dog and just want a free dog. Someone tried to pull that crap when I found my rescue Puppers. Get him chipped ASAP and get a license. Paperwork goes a long way in proving the dog is yours now."
cugd34,"YTA. 


If this is high school, then he should be teaching the material. But you're still TA for what you said. 

If this is university/college, then....dude. Welcome to the real world. Your responsibility is to READ all your instructions/syllabus/assignments for every source. Do what they say and hit all the deadlines. PLUS show up to class and bullshit with the prof on whatever he/she wants to talk about. 

I once had an English prof who did nothing in class except read Beowulf to us. We were still responsible for the assigned reading, the tests, and turning in an essay every Friday.

ETA: In case anyone thinks it should be different in a computer class. I have a CS degree. In all the courses I took, I *never, ever* had a prof who explained how to code. It was *assumed* that you were smart enough to understand how to write code. You got a textbook to read all that shit. Class was spent discussing best practices, most efficient methods, etc."
cugdf2,"YTA

Such empathy. Wow.

For his sake, please break up with him."
cugeh7,"NTA

Honestly, I would make that your response for every single one of those questions she asks. Eventually she'll stop. Hopefully."
cuggfr,"NTA: my question is, why are you friends with her?"
cughsn,Is his dad a boss or manager somewhere. Generally that type of attitude is seen in children of the bosses lol
cugip2,"YTA

If you’re so worried about hair and makeup looking good for YOUR wedding, pay for it yourself. This woman has already paid a sizable about of money for YOUR wedding so you need to let this go.  Literally no one will ever notice or care that she didn’t get her makeup and hair done by the stylist."
cuglpv,"NTA. Partner needs to stop being lazy. He's clearly now using his foot as an excuse because he wants to sleep downstairs. To start with is absolutely fair enough but the fact that he's already preparing excuses for why to keep it down the line it's clear he's just milking it. You're allowed to want to use your own living room for...y'know, living."
cugmgb,"NTA. 

It’s is your education and your choice. 
If you feel comfortable and safe to stay on at your original school then stay.

But maybe see if you can speak to some of the students who attend the promising grammar school to get their view point. Especially those who have done or going to do a-levels"
cugn99,"I feel like more information needs to be provided here to determine if OP is TA or not. 


Caregiver burnout is a real thing. And depending how long they have been taking care of their mother for, that could be an issue that is arising. I also feel knowing how old OP is would help determine this also."
cugosm,"NTA. If she doesn't want to get served, she should obey the laws and pay her tickets. She's a complete asshole for trying to make this your problem."
cugrhz,"ESH. Both of y'all need to do a lot better at co-parenting. They showed little consideration for you, and you're actively undermining their discipline."
cugxgz,"NTA.  Parents that say that their child owe them for what was spent raising them are garbage.  

Well, guess what mom - if you didn't feed and shelter your kid, you would have gone to jail for neglect.  

>I feel shitty and I definitely feel like the asshole.

That's because her deliberate manipulation tactics are working on you.  You're not an asshole.  I don't know how old you are, but you should be making a plan to live independently from her as soon as you possibly can."
cugxx5,"NTA but you if let the overnights happen, you definitely would be to your son. Your job as a father is to put your kid first and protect him from dangerous situations. A dirty house with a dog that bites sounds dangerous. I think honesty is the best policy and you and your wife need to tell them exactly why overnights won’t happen. If you tell them exactly why, it gives them the opportunity to change the situation and make overnights possible and not just shut it off completely."
cuh0yd,"ESH, could've simply ended the conversation and walked away. Seemed like an unnecessary and petty back-and-forth. Boss is also at fault for being the instigator.

Stay away from her and be respectful as much as you can. It'll only help you in the long run!"
cuh23e,"NTA. Not blind myself, but I spend time with several people who are. They clean up their dogs' poop."
cuh375,NTA. Your dad is the asshole for making your aunt suffer for his ego and bad financial decisions.
cuh5s8,[deleted]
cuh7of,"Your question is too ... open to interpretation to really give a solid T/A answer.  In any case,

**Do not ever comment on this until specifically involved**."
cuh7rr,"YWBTA - as a long-time vegetarian, trust me, just tell them it's vegan/vegetarian ahead of time. Either they're fine with it or they pitch a fit, and in the case they pitch a fit I'm sure you'd much rather they do it in a private setting rather than the middle of the restaurant."
cuha9j,NAH However I think she needs to reevaluate why she's busting her ass for a company that doesn't see the work she does.
cuhafz,NAH your folks are adults. You are not responsible for their financial decisions. You are not obligated to keep renting forever. They need to come up with another plan.
cuhfu4,"NTA, but talk to RA about it and also a counselor or someone from medical center as a concern. RD may be a bit of an escalation, depending on environment, over what may be a socially inept student's attempt to handle a new environment and make friends.

Source: I was a socially inept student in college. I learned to ""people"" through the vast patience of others to whom I was a jerk unintentionally. I still don't do well with hints; what is socially obvious to others easily eludes my comprehension."
cuhggo,[deleted]
cuhggp,YTA if you don’t go to the seamstress first and ask for the cost of the dress she ruined. Also leave a review about the experience.
cuhjz9,"Not the asshole. Its YOUR day. Not theirs. Hell, my husband and I got married on a cruise ship to cut the drama completely out."
cuhk9l,"NTA. He's stingy as hell, how unattractive. I wouldn't put up with that kind of guy who counts every penny when it's in his favor, but makes you pay for all the transportation when he makes you come over to his place. Ew."
cuhkt1,NTA - The fact that they didn’t even have the courtesy to tell you that they had rescheduled until YOU contacted them is completely disrespectful. You would absolutely not be the asshole to refuse to accommodate for them again.
cuhpzc,NTA only if you have the right qualifications for the position you're applying for. Nepotism is extremely damaging to company morale; it only isn't if you're aware of your preferential treatment and don't abuse it.
cuhric,"NTA

That’s just horrible. He should definitely be apologizing up and down and sideways and into another dimension. He watched you cry for two weeks thinking you had no friends in this new city. Watched you cry through your birthday dinner and said nothing. He is definitely an asshole. 

Maybe if you seemed okay after what looked like rejection he wouldn’t be. But for you to be upset this long and him say nothing he definitely is. He could have put your mind at ease any time within the past two weeks and chose not to over this ‘surprise.’

Thinking for two weeks no one could make time for dinner then to come home ‘surprise! You actually do have friends!’ It’s just cruel. Nice that they were all there, but I still think it was mean on his part. 

Afterthought: it’s mean on any of their parts too if they knew how upset you were and said nothing."
cuhsex,"NTA i have family in Afghanistan. Due to that experience i have collected i can say, they just rip you off.

They survived and lived there before you were born and will continue even after you not give them money.

They are just greedy"
cuhtk8,"NTA

As is

$1,000

230,000 miles

What does he expect?"
cuhtw3,"NTA you woke up early enough to accommodate her request, she didn't show up, so you decided to have breakfast. Simple."
cuhvzf,NTA- put your foot down and tell your sister you won't be looking after them anymore. If they're left at the house there's 4 other people there to look after them. Stay in your room of need be to send the message.
cuhzgi,YTA you should’ve closed your own window
cui2h6,"NTA - you repeatedly asked her not to remove your charger, which had plenty of room for her device AND even got her her own charger. She's just being inconsiderate."
cui2ng,"NAH. I told a friend this once, and she said I wasn't the first person to make the observation. She also felt that children can pick up some of the same habits/mannerisms from parents who are not biologically related to them, and that can create an impression of resemblance. It's a totally harmless comment, and I'm sure your friend wouldn't mind."
cui3b9,NTA.  Not having been taught something doesn't make you an asshole.
cui59a,"ESH. Literally everyone in this post. Stop using ""gay"" as an insult."
cui9br,NTA.  Ya know what really ruins a party more than canceling?  Giving everyone at the party the flu.  Those germs don’t go away easily.
cui9zl,"NTA. He had multiple chances, and you don't need that kind of crap in your life. You are better off."
cuibbp,YTA - HE WANTS TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE WITH YOU! LET HIM PAY!
cuicdn,"NTA - Your wife should not have invited people on a two week vacation without talking to you about it first. You should also DEFINITELY not vacation with people who vacation at a different speed and have completely different interests. I've vacationed with friends who have a different vacation speed and it ends poorly unless you're really up front about not doing everything, or even most things, together. It also sounds like your wife cancelled the vacation and not you?"
cuiemc,YTA. What a harsh thing to say to someone who is obviously having a hard time. You loving the family has nothing to do with it. ANY one of you could have asked if she wanted to take a walk or involve her in the activities to try and take her mind off the situation.
cuifzq,Nta your house no need to offer to complete strangers
cuikcj,NTA. Rake him over the coals and go after court costs and attorney's fees as well. Your cousin is a dick.
cuikun,"Edit: NTA, It takes two to tango"
cuioar,"Let's play a drinking game. Take a shot every time someone says any of the following. ""You can't control her, she can do whatever she wants!"" ""Either you trust her or you don't!"" ""There's nothing wrong with having male friends (conveniently ignoring context)""

NAH. You're allowed to feel uncomfortable. Expressing your discomfort with something your partner does is **not** controlling, and don't let anyone tell you different. Controlling is trying to force her not to go, it's **communicating** to tell her how you feel, and ask her for reassurance. Considering there were many other people, this doesn't seem too concerning. But if you need help getting past it, talk to her. Ask her where she slept, if anything had happened with that guy in the past, etc.

Don't accuse her, because as far as you know she hasn't done anything wrong. Just be respectful."
cuiqkh,NTA. Why should the raccoon die cause it's a wild animal?
cuivm7,"NTA

You don't know what is in there. I'd get away from it immediately. You have no obligation to watch a random strangers stuff."
cuivyi,Nta tell her NO
cuizci,"NTA. If he seems sad or down about it, I would just level with him very similarly to how you did with us here: “I love it when you go down on me and always have a great time. But sometimes I’m just enjoying lying in bed with you and would rather wait until I’ve just taken a shower rather than getting up and interrupting our time together.”

If he expresses offense at the idea that you don’t want it enough at that moment to go take a shower, well, he seemingly doesn’t want it enough at that moment to perform the act without the shower. So.."
cuj1tf,NTA. He shouldn’t be leaving them around in a shared environment and expecting you to be courteous when he isn’t.
cuj28j,"NTA.

> It's been about 2 months now, so I asked if he had a chance to talk to them about it. He said no because he felt like that was going to be a really awkward conversation to have with them.

What the fuck?  I know it's not what you asked but your husband is definitely the asshole for dragging his feet and not confronting his parents like an adult. ""bUt It'S gOiNg To Be AwKwArD..."" Uh, yeah dad but so will flushing $5 grand down the toilet because grandma can't get someone to cover her fucking shift at A.C. Moore!"
cujamx,"ESH. You don't get to criticize what someone chooses to give someone else; it's not your business.  But it majorly sucks that your mom didn't get you anything,  yet wanted to give SIL something. I'd be hurt too. I'd talk to mom about her lack of gift- but leave her choices towards SIL out of it."
cujc7w,"YTA - she has every right to use an ATM to deposit money as you do. Your reaction was pretty rude and unnecessary. Do you yell at every person who orders too much food in a fast food line as well because they should only order a limited amount ??

She might’ve been taking quite a long time at the machine, but so do a lot of people. You’re not entitled to time at the machine, you should’ve just waited your turn or left when you noticed she was making a few transactions"
cuje5c,"NTA but don’t email their boss. Make your report and then mind your business, let the authority in power act as it is intended"
cujesj,"Correction: The father needs to talk to the mother. Ex's girlfriend asking (valid, admittedly) questions about how she raises her kid will likely not go over well."
cujfzy,"NAH: This doesn't only apply to sex btw, if she was loud for other reasons I'd say the same: I think she should respect quiet hours in a shared living space.

But has anyone told her she's really loud? She could be the asshole, or just really oblivious. You should bring it up to her since it's been an issue for a while, but not during the act. You had earlier opportunities to tell her.

Imo, don't let issues build up into resentment, you should tell her ASAP but give her the benefit of the doubt that she's oblivious, and don't embarrass her during the act."
cujgg2," YTA. You need to communicate like an adult when a friend does something to bother you. You’re making a lot of assumptions about her having a mental illness, and how fruitful any conversations with her might be, in order to justify this cycle of hang-silent treatment-ghost that you’re doing.

Things will never change between the two of you if one of you doesn’t say something. She reaches out and tries. You don’t. And she’s right—it is manipulative for you to do. She’s having to guess at what’s upsetting you, and having your company and affection given and withdrawn, to her, at random. She doesn’t know the rules of being your friend, *because you won’t tell them to her*."
cujh6z,"NTA

Wu would you listen to his rants if he can't even listen to something real that your other friend is going through. Friendships are built on trust and compassion. Behaviour like this makes me wonder if you could tell R something that was trubbeling you and if he would even listen or just discard your emotions. The reason people ghost him is probably because of this. 

You don't have to ghost the guy yourself but you could tell him that what he did was wrong and shitty, a dick move and he can try to be better or he can't be your friend."
cujhik,"NTA. You wanting to be alone to regenerate energy is nothing you should feel ashamed for. People are different and as you describe you feel it's exhausting to spend time with your family, seemingly because they enjoy things you don't wich makes you tiered but not them. Don't beat yourself up for being a little different. If your parents can't understand and respect the way you feel that sucks but try to remember that there's nothing wrong with feeling the way you do."

cujjwg,"YTA, I don’t understand why you initially agreed to go for another 10 minutes if you didn’t enjoy it, and it was on you to make sure you had time for that second massage before agreeing to it.

cujm44,"I'd say NTA. regardless of the law, pedestrians have the right of way over vehicles. she can wait for you to cross. I live in a city where jaywalking is rampant especially in the outdoor mall in downtown and it's just expected to watch out for stray pedestrians who cross on a don't walk (even without the timer)

i believe that the law (at least in my city/state) is technically that you cannot start walking if it's counting down, but no one really obeys that in my city at least. she was definitely TA for being impatient. if you want to avoid another situation like that then maybe walk a little faster? but you're not obligated to."

cujuhb,NAH You seem like a really great dad and I don't think it's wrong at all to have your son with even on your anniversary but it's probably a good idea to set aside a day when you know you won't have your son to be able to celebrate your anniversary with just you and your girlfriend. It's sounds like she just really wanted to spend time with you and that's ok too.
cujyh8,"NTA.  You were nice to ask her to move rather than just call for a tow.  If she were sprinting to an ambulance loading up her daughter, then yeah, you could have parked elsewhere. But if she had enough time to sass you about it, she had enough time to find somewhere else to park."
cuk0vn,"NTA

Grieving does not trump breaking the law. It's not even like you called the cops to rat them out. Them being parked at the stop sign is dangerous, which is why such things are laws. There is a stop sign right by my dads house. When I go to visit during very crowded bbqs I park 2 houses down - because I'm legally allowed to do so and it's better than breaking the law for arbitrary reasons."
cuk2l3,"NTA I have two pit bulls and I also worry about my two dogs being stolen for dogfighting. People come up to my gate all the time and just watch them until I tell them to leave. If anyone threatened them like that (and it was absolutely a threat) I would do the same thing. Don’t mess with my dogs. 

Jobs are important, but it didn’t sound like he was doing a very good job. If your method of preventing customer complaints is to say “If I mess up, I’ll steal your pets,” maybe you shouldn’t have that job. By the way, I always tip and leave 5star reviews."

At this point I would like to call up anyone else who may want to say a few words. Thank you.""

Then you go sit down.

**You can wear the ring however you like; but don't be surprised that wearing it on your engagement finger causes speculation.**

Edit: Your Mom probably is acting so uncomfortable because she is (understandably) assuming that you're signaling marriage intentions with your girlfriend.  No matter how much she loves your girlfriend, this is probably this first time this has come up and she's processing the implications.  She may think your claim of that finger being ""the most comfortable"" is disingenuous at best, attention-whoring at worst.

NTA . But he does know where you live."
cul6es,"I have mixed feelings about this. I totally get your girlfriend's point- there's a myriad of birth control options for women- but virtually all of them have bad, sometimes life-altering bad side effects. And it *is* frustrating to always be the one who has to be responsible for it but that's the way it is. Since men don't have many options for birth control, this burden falls almost entirely on women in heterosexual relationships. 

I agree with you that no one should be able to force you to get a vasectomy. But I know, hypothetically, if I was in a relationship where we were sure we didn't want children and my long term partner wasn't willing to step up and get a vasectomy, I would be very upset *possibly* to the point of not wanting to be in a relationship with them any longer. Because vasectomies are incredibly safe, effective, and side effect free. There really isn't a female equivalent. A woman getting her tubes tied is much more invasive.

I don't think it's crazy for your girlfriend to bring this up now since if you stay together, you will probably eventually be in this position. I do think it was shitty of her to assign ""toxic masculinity"" as your reason, without having a strong reason to believe this was true. 

Overall, I'd say a very soft NTA, because I sympathize with your girlfriend."
cul7h6,"NTA - You didn't cancel last minute, you cancelled the day before. Also, your 'friend' is a psychopath."

culie5,"Solely based off what you are writing, I'm going with YTA.

How old are you and what do you mean- attached to her?  And why was it rock?  Specifics?  


>I talked to her many times about needing the feeling of affirmation from her

This seems excessive to me and not something she should be responsible for at all.  Especially because of this:  


>we are online friends only

It really sounds like you are possessive and jealous."
cullzv,"I'm torn between NAH and a lowercase yta...
I'd understand if it was a lot more people but you're not just leaving these few friend you've made but also the other two. How about instead go buy everyone dinner one night an then invite your friends over to hang out? It won't cost you much, and for all you know it'll be the nicest thing someone does for one of them in a while. Look at it as life experience if it was a corporate work thing you'd bring donuts or whatever for everyone, even Karen from accounting. Same principle I think. :)"
culmy9,ESH.. okay to report her but it sounds like your intentions aren’t pure.

You were planning on these babies being part of your family and now you are just abandoning them because you are pregnant with a biological child you love more. YTA because you were never ready to adopt in the first place because you're willing to drop out now. Parenthood isn't something you can just cancel. YTA for putting the biological mother through this difficult situation by lying to her and telling her you were ready to adopt for months when clearly you weren't, preventing her from finding parents who will truly care for these babies. YTA for what this will do to your 12 year olds who were expecting to have adopted siblings but are now going to be confused about what it means to commit to parenthood.

Congratulations on your pregnancy, but shame on you for committing to parenthood and disappearing when something better comes along. Obviously you shouldn't go through with the adoption because those twins are already less than your biological child. But yes, YTA."

Now you want that same autonomy. She doesn't have the right to tell you to keep shaving. You don't have the right to tell her to keep shaving. You can both be hairy or both shave.

NTA

I may have to accept my downvotes, because Reddit lets pregnant women get away with A LOT.  She stole both of your days after you sent out invites and then acted shocked that you were upset.  Your delivery was not kind, but you were hurt and emotional that half of your family was abandoning your special days due to her antics. Hopefully, she grows up at some point!  I am so so sorry you had to deal with that!"

And I need INFO: did your grandparents explicitly said what they would be helping you out with? 
Because if it is with these things, I mean you should have gave that money to your parents straight away and maybe ask if you could keep some of that for your own things. Because maybe yes your parents saved up for college, but depending on the country, that can be a big burden with all the associated expenses (books, copies, housing, loans, etc). And maybe clear this with your parents, and talk it out. 
Acting like this YTA."
cumqkq,"ESH, Her for flipping out over petty nonsense in the first place and trying to manipulate you by holding the car over your head. And also because you should be checking your gas tank before you get on the highway. It's not hard, it's right in your line of sight.

cumvjb,"NTA   This is not ""keeping the boyfriend away from family"".  Having family that show up uninvited and take advantage of your hospitality is a kind of toxic family dynamic.  Your apartment is your home too.   You do not need to bring in unwanted guests that make it so you can't feel at home in your own home.  If you stop letting him in, he will stop wasting his time on you.  If you let him in, this will never end."

He doesn’t deserve to be coddled."
cumvo2,"YTA for only setting boundaries with your parents when YOU were impacted. You should have set boundaries years ago when they were burdening your wife.

When your parents lived behind you and your wife, you knew it was untenable. When you relocated back to your home state, instead of leaving your parents up to their own devices, you helped your dad get a job in your area. You basically blew up your own geographical boundary.

I get the impression it’s been easy for you to shrug off your parents disrespectful behavior because your wife bore the brunt of it. You had very little skin in the game. 

It was ONLY when your parents said they expected YOU to assume the responsibility of taking care of them in their later years that you managed to assert yourself. 

You need to grow up, boss up, and cut the umbilical cord. Instead of thinking about how your parents are going to negatively impact you, put your wife’s feelings first. 

You’re their son, but you’re a husband and father first. Act like it."

Edit after given info:

YTA. Your parents pay a few hundred a month for you to live with another family so that you can do what you want to do, you 100% don't also deserve a car. 

Think about it for a sec. Your living expenses are probably $400 a month more than your sisters. Plus if your parents give you the money for uber. 

She deserves a car, because you are getting a MAJOR thing from your parents. My would NEVER do that for me, and I don't have a car.

This clearly has upset you. I'm curious about why?  I know in my home I have a beautiful piece of art my grandma painted that hangs above the toilet.  It is not an insult to her talent, but actually reflective of how her art elevates the bathroom to a peaceful and beautiful space for cleanliness.   

Hypothetically, **if your MIL *loved* your gift, and put it in a place of peace and sanctuary deliberately, how do you predict she will feel when she notices you stole it?** Really."
cunid9,"NTA

cunk63,"YTA. Look up literally anything about the mental workload and it should help you figure out why you're the asshole. You're grown enough to know that certain things need to be done, and do them. It's mental labor for your wife to keep a running list of the things that need to be done, and then delegate on top of her portion of the housework, and also her job. Choose specific chores that you're going to do everyday and do them. And from time to time do something else to help her out as well. Again, you're an adult. Figure out what needs to be done and do it."

It can be hurtful to be left out of a lunch on purpose, but you have also made a big deal out of it. It sounds like you won't be able to expect much more out of the friendship.

On the other hand, if you know she acts like this, it is also kind of ridiculous to get upset when it keeps happening."

cunvw0,"Yeah, I didn’t react that well to it. Tbh I was kinda stunned and my friends who had my back were being really defensive while the ones who said that it was racist was just like “yeah, not cool, here’s why” I’m a neutral way, so I just kinda went with my defense."
cunwo1,"NTA at all. This sounds like a SERIOUS problem. I hate to say it, but it truly doesn’t sound like she wants to commit. It’s great she spends time with her friends, but being out THAT much *and* not even telling you some nights is not okay. This is something you cannot ignore and cannot let her keep doing - you need to have a serious talk about your relationship and your future.

Edit: also... I’m really not trying to jump to conclusions, but are you sure she’s hanging out with her friend(s)? You not being invited and her getting MAD at it is, again - not normal at all and not something you should just deal with. She’s 100% in the wrong for never inviting you."

cunz95,"Yes, YTA.  But not for the obvious reasons.

Two people you care about and want to make their life better:  Your GF and your roommate.

One person who you don't really care about: The mom of the roommate.

Yes, the mom of the roommate deserves no sympathy -- she is both homophobic and two-faced.  But you can make the world a better place for your roommate.  While mom deserves what you are thinking about dishing her way, the people who pay the price are your GF and (most especially) the roommate.

One possible way to help that is to have your GF over -- but with a different goal.  To show the mom that a lesbian can find love and live a fulfilling, complete life.  Just like everyone else.   No forced PDA, not attempt to rub her nose in it.  Just modeling normal adult behavior.

But, really, I would talk to the roommate.  It is her mom and what you do complicates her relationship -- not yours.  Your roommate needs a caring friend in her corner a lot more than you need the satisfaction of poking mom.  Roommate has tough road ahead...."
cuo08w,Info - so the first few days you didn't try to go into the bedroom to hang out?  You expected them to come to you?
cuo0ui,"NTA, not at all. It's basic common courtesy to thank someone even more minor things, let alone fixing their car for free. 

Also, I don't think your dad understands what saving money means lol.  

Maybe he's just insecure because he didn't know how to fix his car but someone else did, I dunno. 

Don't let that discourage you from helping people though, most people would be extremely appreciative."

cuo1us,"NTA for wanting to hire help for your wife. But I do get to wondering what the full situation is from her perspective.

Assuming you're in bed at a reasonable time ,and the baby is up for no longer than say an hour....it could not be leaving you *that* sleep deprived that you need to sleep in a few more hours while she is up . 

Again I don't think yta for wanting to hire help. As a SAHM I would love this . But maybe your wife sees things differently then you perceive the situation . I.e maybe you aren't being as helpful as you believe you are ? Being a full time sahm is incredibly exhausting."

If you tell someone you have diabetic gastroparesis you'll probably have to give them a gross explanation, which they will immediately counter with offers of essential oils, ""cleanses,"" and the ol' ""Have you tried....?"" routine.  

""I have an allergy"" gets the point across bluntly."
cuomsl,NTA - You’re allowed to vent. It’s your personal device.
cuonaf,"NTA. What kind of a father will go to a party instead of seeing his new born in the hospital. He is TA 1,000,000%"
cuonl4,"NTA, you did what was a favor for your manager who had done favors for you before and you felt that was the right thing to do. Shes the asshole for threatening you over something you felt you should have done."
cup0tl,"NTA, he could have just given you a 10, a 5, and 5 x 1s back instead to let you choose how much to tip without being a dick and suggesting you didn't even want to leave one."
cup2b6,"NAH - similar situation here as well, but my grandparents have grown to accept eggs but we still hide them whenever they come

They're not assholes they never did anything, but you aren't either."
cup7n4,"YTA. Your friend offered to back out to allow you to vacation with your girlfriend, and you declined this option. Now that you're going together, you want to ditch her for part of the trip. You even say that you know the friend will be annoyed. That's pretty bad.

Also, your girlfriend's plan to schedule a trip at the same time as you so that you'd end up leaving your friend for her is pretty icky. It's like she's trying to steal someone else's trip, made even worse by the fact that she was offered the exact same trip."
cupal7,YTA.  You shouldn't catch a 8:50 train for a 9am job.  Plan ahead
cupeu5,"NTA. Wow. That's a complete and total overreaction from your ex. Of the ""I wonder if he's still got some residual feelings"" type. Like, that might make emotional sense. But still. He needs to remember it's just a freaking game."
cupkc3,"""so I got off the bus a stop early""  


So let me get this straight... You were \*\*\*ONE\*\*\* stop away from your destination and you decided to wait 45 minutes to ride the bus ONE stop. How far is it between bus stops? Could you not have walked the remaining distance? Are you physically disabled (Legit question)? What stopped you from walking? It isn't usually more than a few hundred yards between bus stops. 

And if you didn't call your date to say you would be late, then YTA."
cupn1c,"
Id say NTA canceled on the first due to work. You are both work oriented which is why you broke up. It's closer to your work. 

What is the point of this coffee lmfao"
cuppj4,"YTA. It’s a “passing lane” for a reason. I think your choice to stay in the left lane is totally fine and perfectly respectable in your situation, especially because it’s only two lanes, but only right up until the point where you notice the truck coming up in your rear. When it’s safe to do so, get over to the right and let the car pass. If you’re watching your mirrors, like we are all taught in drivers ed, you will have more than enough time to get over before causing any really turmoil. (Not saying you specifically- because it seems like you are a really aware driver, which I applaud and am so grateful for)

I’m not condoning his excessive speeding. But I think, as drivers, it’s all of our responsibility to watch the road and respect fellow drivers. Obeying the “passing lane” rule is a form of awareness. You’re a better driver by following it. Not only are you more aware, but it’s safer for all parties to pass on the left. 

And it helps traffic. 

I totally and fully admire you for being aware of this rule because it seems like so many drivers just feel safer driving in the left lane and driving at the speed limit or close to it - which is completely within the law, at least within CA, that I’m aware of. But doing this, imo, causes so much frustration, road rage, traffic, and unsafe driving habits. 

Thanks for listening. And thanks for your question!"
cupqd1,"YTA.  I feel your pain (I have two younger siblings), but assuming you’re substantially older you should know better than to get physical like that with a kid. Yea it’s annoying, but I think pulling his hair was an inappropriate response."
cuprs5,"What no NTA - your friend sounds like a prick, bit that could be due to the mental health issue"
cuptou,"ESH. The dog is a living animal, not an object, something capable of loving and being loved. It's 100% fair to not treat a ""transaction"" involving the dog the same as anywhere else. You've all wronged this dog, though, because they should have trained it if they wanted to keep it. And hopefully the new owner will do right by it."
cupu28,"NTA. As much as it sucks for the parents being punished for their child's behavior, a gathering of people should not have to be subjected to that madness. I'd uninvite them in a heartbeat. I can't stand misbehaving children."
cupuhd,"People aren't dead at 30, dude."
cupux5,"NTA. You are not obligated to spend time with a homophobic parent, let alone stay under their roof. Prioritise your own mental wellbeing."
cupv93,"NTA you didn’t have to even tip him in the first place. I know it’s courteous but you went out of your way to give him money, you can’t be the asshole."
cupwqe,"NTA - moving isn't a family party - while more hands can make lighter work, the whole fam damnly showing up isn't going to make things easier for anyone. If they all want to see the campus I'm sure there's a family day they can come to"
cupxri,**NTA** Dumb argument but sounds like he isn't respecting your boundaries and you have a right to be upset.
cuq46h,"NAH.  As long as your reason isn't to be petty I see no harm. Besides, let's say you kept it for sentimental reasons - do you really think you'll still want to keep it when you're 50yrs old? Eventually you'll probably give it away. It may be tomorrow or in 10 years."
cuq4a4,Nta and this is why you don't buy property together when you're just dating.
cuq7rc,NTA. If he is misusing your generosity you can and should stop it.
cuq8ex,"NTA- As an ex member I say fuck the Mormon church do whatever you want. 

But actually acknowledging the fact that they deserve *some* respect, I don't think you need to mention it's for a gay wedding. You're just asking for parking, not use of the building or the bishop to officiate. The gay part of the wedding doesn't effect the parking on anyway."
cuq8zk,"NTA. Your friend wants to call, control the conversation and completely ignore you. She could  be talking to a carpeted wall and have the same results. It sounds like she doesn’t give two shits about you. I’m sorry."
cuqaop,"NTA- that’s very weird that anyone would be jealous over something like this. But! Clearly they are, and that’s how they feel, and that’s their kid. 

Personally I’d be so happy to see something like this between my kids and their aunts and uncles. I think it’s beautiful. Its good for the kids, and yeah it’s a bit selfish of her to try and deminish that. A real loss. She’s just insecure, probably sees something in you that she doesn’t have.

But no you aren’t out of line, that’s super odd behaviour."
cuqcfr,She loves chasing the chaser
cuqd7i,NAH. But it’s all about tact and doing it the right way. He may not know how loud he is.
cuqekl,"YTA

Your daughter needs your emotional support. This is a pivotal moment in her life and you are communicating to her that you expect her to fail. You are using her sister’s mistakes to justify this opinion. Not only is that unfair, it’s dangerous. Kids have a way of meeting our expectations where we set them. You are undermining her career path before she even gets started. 

Of course it’s your money and your choice. But as a parent, IMO it’s your job to *help* your child to succeed in life. If you have legitimate concerns about her maturity and decision making, TALK to her. Create a plan. Say “we are willing to invest x amount of money into your education and here is what we expect from you and here is what will happen if you don’t hold up your end of the deal.  We believe you can do this.”  And then if she struggles, find out why. If necessary, let her actions bring about their own natural consequences. 

Believe in your kid. Give her a chance. Teach, guide and support. Don’t just judge, undermine and control."
cuqi2a,"YTA. You divided what you felt were equal responsibilities.

Just because someone worked efficiently you decided equal was no more equal and relegated your parts to them.

Quit moving goalposts.

She's free to help if she wants to, not because you want to. Bet you she regretted handing her work to you early and thinking she was just trying to accommodate you doing your part."
cuqig9,"NTA you tried to be careful with the ashes from your smoke and there isn’t a way you could know that her cat would get sick,it’s your right to smoke in your apartment that you pay for, (hope the cat is ok though)"

cuqld3,"YTA - Why? Well for one it wasn't a SPARE shirt as you claim, but your friends actual only shirt. You then later figure she shouldn't have given it up so easily as you were 'under the influence', but you also make pains to point out the whole peace love unity thing, so I bet your friend felt pressurised into giving it up, especially with her first time at a rave and all.

Honestly how you can't see this is baffling to me."
cuqnyp,"NAH - You're talking to a girl your gf doesn't know, she got defensive, you got defensive, and you had a reactive spat

&#x200B;

50 million couples are having this exact argument right this second

&#x200B;

Wait a couple hours, take a deep breath, and revisit the issue when you both have calmed down"
cuqp2d,"NTA, they are your kitchen utensils. However, you can expect her dirty kitchen utensils to be in the sink in the future."
cuqrxj,"NTA that’s a messed up friend who took advantage of your money. He lied about going over the mileage and then scratched the car and asked you to pay for it. I would cut him off. 

Next time your paying for something do it in your name"
cuqsfa,"YTA 

If you're close with your family, you should really know your immediate family members birthdays, especially your mom's.

On a side note,  my brother and grandmother shared June 23rd as their birthday."
cuqtgd,"This ones tough but I’m gunna go with NTA with a little bit of ESH. Generally speaking, she shouldn’t have called you fat in the first place, but you could have been the bigger person (no pun intended) and not said it back to her. On the other hand, i think that what you said back to her was perfect and funny. She was a bitch first and you were just giving back the sass to her."
cuqx16,"NTA, I liked your comment about not knowing how much drama their family has. It seems like a lot if she keeps bugging for a relationship, threatening your other relationships and after you already declined her request and then ignored. 

Is Facebook your only contact? I would just block her, maybe reset your privacy too so people can’t search for you. I’m sorry you are dealing with this."
cuqxpk,"YTA - I say this with kindness because you can't help how you feel, but trying to interfere makes you controlling instead. You're putting your own relationship on the rocks for someone who he no longer has feelings for, lives far away, and is in a committed relationship. 

I would be very wary of a partner that tried to curtail my friendships with people I used to be involved with, not because I want anything, but because it denotes a lack of trust and emotional maturity. 

Also, there's been a post just like this but from the other perspective, did you guys decide to post to AITA together?"
cuqzel,"NTA, it was your grandfather's choice to leave money to you and not her. Don't feel like you have to make up for it!"
cur0l5,"NTA. If it's that important to him that you have the same last name as him, he can change his name to yours. Since he ""refuses"" to do so, you are perfectly within your rights to refuse as well."
cur2il,"NTA, but this is a complex one. I have a chronic illness, and I can tell you that I sometimes do things that are extremely difficult for me because I have to. Some people (not family, fortunately) then assume that I'm able to do those things with ease, and expect even more of me. Your mom might be in genuine physical pain, and it's probably impossible for you to know for sure whether she's being dishonest.

That said, she's TA for expecting so much of you and being ungrateful about it. There's no excuse for that. She might be in pain, but she needs to recognise that she's using you as a carer, and that combined with the financial difficulty is a lot of pressure. At the very least she should thank you for all you do.

I'm not in the US, but I'd suggest speaking to a school counselor or, if your mom doesn't mind, accompanying her to a doctor's appointment so you can talk about the practical difficulties at home and ask where to go from there. There may be community resources available to help you."
cur2r0,"YTA - your preoccupation with him was your problem, not his.  It’s akin to all the folks against public breastfeeding because THEY can’t keep from looking at the breasts.

Grow up."
cur2z4,"NTA - she doesn't owe you an invite if you're not friends, so you 100% don't owe her listening to her bullshit excuses. Don't put any more time into people who obviously never cared as much as you did."
cur6qd,"NTA. Don’t look through this feed in the first place, just makes things easier. That being said everything he said after your argument isn’t cool. Sounds like a really nice dude... maybe take him up on his offer of “leaving the relationship”"
cur8im,YTA she just wants to spend time with her boyfriend and might not have time to text back. You wasted her time and brought up something that you know makes her upset multiple times and she gave the same answer. Give her some time with her boyfriend and text her when she’s not occupied
cur9ue,"NTA. 
You couldn’t risk not telling his parents with the possibility of violence or injury to one of your students. 
It’d been a breach of your duty of care."
cur9vp,"NTA. I’ve had bedbugs and I wouldn’t let anyone in I suspected of having them. I don’t care if I am being an arsehole, I’m not having that again!"
curg0i,"ESH  


Your girlfriend is insecure and controlling, you're basically a mental abuser, and your ex clearly had more issues than just you so she really shouldn't be blaming you for everything. Cut off contact and get some therapy with your current GF if you want to save the relationship"
curowu,"NTA. You can invite who you want. Prepare for the fact that she may not attend, which would be an equally valid decision on her part."
curr46,"NTA You're all adults, you are not their babysitter or chaperone."
curyrb,"NTA. Your buddy is TA because if he really cares for the girl on the phone he shouldn’t have been out grinding on other women, and he certainly shouldn’t have told you to answer the phone. 

Edit: I reread the post and realized that the friend asked you to answer the phone."
curzd2,NTA he sounds like a dick 😳✋
cus48k,"YTA. I actually dont really want to call you the asshole in this but it's really the only option. It's his life, he is free to do what makes him happy. He is not forcing you to ride it. It is unfortunate that you will have a fear of something bad happening to him in the back of you're head but that is something that comes with it and if it's what he wants he is an adult and can make those decisions whether he consults you or not. Now should he have consulted you or told you first, sure, but even if you were against it, I don't think he should have let that impact his decision, and perhaps he reason for not telling you is because he felt he wouldn't go through with it if you questioned him on it. Had he asked you and you flipped out and then he didn't get the bike because of it, then he would resent you for not letting him live his life."
cus6zq,"YTA
You are adult in this scenario- ACT LIKE ONE.
Another persons shitty behaviour does not allow you to act so as well.
Take to your parents get her properly punished or to work to buy the piece of clothing back.
You bitch about your sister being entitled and uneducated in common courtesy yet you thing theft (and lets face it if you ""lent"" her that bag years ago and then moved away, you gave it to them) and dropping the inevitable fallout on your dads lap and wallet are solutions.
Yeah they fucked up in parenting, that's, again no reason for you to not BE BETTER."
cus7m2,"YTA. You quit because you were afraid of losing. That's just pathetic. If you knew you weren't going to play if you thought you couldn't win, you shouldn't have entered in the first place. Now you ruined someone else's tournament with it because you were too scared to lose."
cus8ct,"NTA, if you had done that in the first place you'd be a minor asshole, but the fact that he didn't take no for an answer meant he deserved it."
cusatl,"NTA Your private feelings are yours to keep to yourself. She deserves an answer in the form of a yes or a no, perhaps a general statement. I am not interested or something similar but nothing more."
cusb78,"NTA. If she didn't know the extent of what you went through, shouldn't she now be the one to apologise?"
cusg1w,"NAH

To your points:

1) Sounds like your mistake. It's just common that people speak with each other in their native language, if they are not forced to speak English, because not everyone can express himself in English on the level he would like. But if you speak English with them, they play along. Think it's totally normal. 

2) This totally sucks and sounds like a difficult and very conservative environment. 

You want to get out, you have a good job offer. There is nothing wrong with changing the job and you don't have to feel guilty. Take the offer and explain your boss in a fair feedback discussion why you switch."
cusibn,"NTA.  You missed the hints he was dropping.  He wasn’t offering to be platonic roommates, he wanted to get back together.  This would be an awkward living arrangement, and he probably won’t get over you if you’re living together."
cusiow,NTA why don't you ask if she would be happy with you moving into hers and not paying while you make money off your property.
cusjyt,"YTA. Ya know what ? Its not cool to mock *anyone's* work like this. You don't like it, or think its weird, or beyond cringy ? Don't watch it. But the fact that you think its funny or cool to take the piss out of someone else's work, says far more about you than it does about them.

This is someone's whole world and you've just posted it up on Reddit. God knows what sorts of comments this poor person is going to get now."
cuskkn,"Wow, they're assholes if they didn't listen to you. It's *your* wedding and you repeatedly asked for a quiet meal with them. They didn't respect your wishes. 

I'd say NTA but you know that not going will cause a lot of drama."
cusko2,">>they are known thieves 

It sounds like they've found a way to graduate from thieves into freeloaders, with PopPop's help. Boot their asses before they walk off with the copper wiring and appliances, and be prepared for them to do extensive property damage as retribution once they realize the scam is up. 

NTA"
cusnpp,"YTA.  She’s exploring hobbies when she’s around someone who has them.  It’s normal.  

Example:  I’m into running.  At one point my now husband gave it a go and for a time we ran together.  It didn’t last for him, but he had showed interest in what I’m into.

YTA for calling her out rudely."
cusrnb,"NTA. He’s not a good boyfriend. You need to get out of this relationship. 

I’m betting they told you this on the last post. And I’m guessing you’re waiting for him to change because what you have is “special.” He won’t change. He’s been like this before. He picked someone young because he wants someone he can boss around. 

Girl, run."
cusv4f,"YTA, holy mother of entitled teenager batman! ok, i remember being fifteen too. but stop treating your parents like housekeepers! no, it's not strictly their duty to clean the house, it's your duty too because you live there! also...
>he said just go wash it yourself in a condescending tone

gonna be honest, you definitely deserved to be condescended to here. to the max."
cuswxa,"NTA, let her live there but don't give it to her. You own the house, so rent it to her for $0 a month. Or however you want to look at it, but I wouldn't sign it into her name or give her any sort of decision making power over the house"
cusynm,NAH its good to be honest and not drag it out to hurt his feelings later
cuszoq,"NAH, **for a one-time exception**, while you figure out how to adjust... but you're going to have to tell your son eventually. YWBTA if you ask them to *continue* to hide it whenever they want to spend time with you. You could ask them to still avoid things that might count as ""in your face,"" but you need to prepare your son for that possibility.

Ask your doctor (and these friends) if there are any relevant support groups or places you could find others with similarly restrictive diets."
cut0xx,"NTA. Although when she said ""there are 2 kinds, sausage and veggie,"" you should have just saved yourself a headache and said ""sausage.""

What does ""DD"" stand for?"
cut2re,NTA. You are right it's not on you. If his state was that fragile they should have made the request prior or gone somewhere without alcohol.
cut3dt,Nah I mean you didn't ask if you could hitch a ride and they didn't know you were coming
cut71s,"NTA, and it sounds like you would appreciate the r/raisedbynarcissists subreddit.

I'm sorry your mom is so awful to you."
cut74m,NTA you are being careful. She probably loves the gifts and that is why she is ignoring the safety concerns.
cut8kg,"Hmm. I’d definitely feel some kind of way about not being invited. Going with NAH because it sounds as if they have more in common and it may have come up organically. They would definitely be assholes if they intentionally excluded you and then your friend posted photos to rub it in. If you actually would want to try going I’d just talk to them when they’re back, “Hey, photo looks great! Wish I knew about the trip. Let me know next time as I’d love to go.” You’ll likely be able to tell by their reaction how it went down."
cutcij,"NTA, why does your roommate act like an 8 year old? Is this summer camp or college? Also, get better communication skills. Like, better than ""eat a dick."""
cuthcw,"YTA. I know you meant well, but you assumed that the way you handled panic attacks would be the best way for her to handle them:

>I've had panic attacks in the past (not as strong as hers, however) and I always found it helpful to focus on other things and basically try to ""forget"" the attack, taking control of it this way...From previous personal experiences, I always found myself even more saddened and feeling defeated if I let my panic control me enough to give up halfway.

In severe panic attacks, none of this is going to be helpful. The symptoms are physical, and you can't ""forget"" them.

It was kind of you to help your friend out by getting them work, but it actually sounds like they're not up to it. Don't push them to do something that's so clearly beyond them physically."
cuthr3,"NTA. And even if the kids *are* special needs, that's a reason to get them a sitter if the parents want to go out, not a reason to subject other diners to unruly children. If the parents were doing everything they could to control their kids but it was still a scene then it'd be no assholes here, but regardless of *why* the kids were acting up, the parents didn't take reasonable steps to be considerate of other diners.

Edited to add: This is contingent upon this restaurant being, like, a bistro or something and not a Chuck E. Cheese. If it's the type of place kids are typically allowed to run around and ""be kids"" then this is moot and you'd be TA, but I don't think that's the case."
cutkbb,"YWBTA - Kids can benefit from both parenting styles. In our case, it was my wife that was more the rough-houser and me that was the calm one. Also, to say that ""yard work"" is a substitute for playing with their dad is a bit of an AH statement."

So my brother is supposed to be moving to Edmond this weekend. He was originally supposed to be moving Tuesday, but then he and my parents pushed it back. Now he and my parents are saying Wednesday.

My sister is going to be moving into his room and out of mine after we shared for 12 years (she’s 12F and I’m 17F). Because they keep pushing it back, she’s still in my room. I’m going to be honest here - I hate my sister. I would trade her for 20 dollars if it got her out of my life. It’s a combination of our personalities & sharing a room that created our explosive dynamic. We regularly get into screaming fits and slap and punch each other. I’ve thrown pencils and pens and pulled out scissors. Anyway,

This morning my mom came in and told me lay off my brother about moving out and my sister started mocking me and calling me a brat. That just got me angry and when my mom told I to knock it off, I did but went ahead and grabbed the car keys and went to the park to cool off. I do think it’s my fault I exploded because I have a bad temper but my sister was teasing me and laughing behind my mother. This probably sounds really rambly and stupid but I’m typing it like 10 mins after.

Thanks

cutnrf,NTA leave. Go back to your mom. That’s called verbal abuse
cutsex,"NTA. From my experience, and lesson learned the hard way, when people move out at different times you need to pick a date in advance to meet at the house and clean. That, compensation, or splitting a cleaning service 4 ways is the only reasonable way to go about it."
cutxj0,"NTA, so many people do this and they are the assholes. I’m really surprised he’s not more willing to give you the dog, that way he still gets to see him. I’ve had 2 dogs now I’ve basically taken from my family because they couldn’t deal with them. Just wait a year or 2 down the road he’s going to try and get another dog...definitely NTA, he deserves to be yelled at for being selfish"
cutxw4,"NTA



.....and, btw, ""ordering  me to call"" hahahaha did you politely or forcefully tell him to shove that *order* up his ass?"
cuu0zh,"NTA. Not only can zoloft cause you to feel tired, but it can make you feel erratic when you start it, like you may not have complete control over your actions. Psych meds are a big deal, especially when it comes to people who are meant to care for you, such as parents, teachers, and coaches."
cuu4jc,"ESH.  Your mom should have better time management but having ""a go"" with her won't change things.  Choices are an adult conversation or telling her you need to be somewhere 30 min earlier than reality to get around her   tardiness."
cuu6a4,"Nta, never let a parent persuade you to go on a guilt trip. Literally in this case as well. Parents who abuse their childrens love for them for their own gain are trash. 

If you were my kid. I'd tell you this: hun, i miss you like crazy. But I want you to be happy. If it's there you need to be, then it's there you need to be. I'm proud of you for having the guts to make your own path in life. If ever the need is there, know I'll be there for you. And if fate intends it otherwise, I know you have the guts, knowledge and kindness to get through anything that life throws at you."
cuu7qk,"NAH It's not really a dilemma, I believe. Besides that I don't really know much about games, but why would you want both a console and a PC version?"
cuuakk,"Yta- you knew she was going to shower. Just because you were sweaty/got in there faster/ don't take as long as her, doesnt give you the right to decide your needs are more important than hers. 

Frankly its a stupid thing to argue over, and it wouldn't have killed either of you to wait politely."
cuuk88,"YTA, not because guys should pay on the first date, but because you shouldn’t expect anyone to know who’s paying when you just drop it in their lap like that. Payment should be discussed before the date, like “hey, wanna go here and split the bill?” Shouldn’t be that hard.

Plenty of women WANT to split the bill, but have no clue if the guy will get offended. Once had a guy get so mad at me for trying to split that I had to block him and move on. Now I always ask BEFORE the date

You should be better communicating how you want the bill to be paid. You’re not only spending a bunch of money for no reason (that date sounds hella expensive) but you’re proving that you can’t even communicate and expecting the other person to read your mind.

Also consider that social etiquette dictates that the person who initiated the date pays for the date. If she asked you, it wouldn’t be crazy for you to assume that SHES paying. If you keep asking women and then wondering why they don’t offer, this could also be it.

I don’t think you’re the asshole for wanting to split, you just need to better communicate it is all. I wish you luck on future dates!"

cuuyot,"NTA. She's a shitty houseguest. 

Re: Toilet seat though. Jesus. Put the fucking toilet seat AND LID down. You're fucking showering the bathroom with airborne piss particles when you flush, you animal. Your fucking toothbrush is in the same room. Toilet lids exist for a reason. Use them, you savage. Nobody wants to be staring into a literal shithole upon entering your bathroom either. It's aesthetically gross as well as being unhygienic. 

/rant"
cuv1u1,NAH but make sure you word this very carefully so that it doesn't come across like you're accusing her of being a bad mother. Maybe focus on the fact that your baby is at a developmental stage where socialization is very important and they would get a ton of socialization in daycare. Similar rational around language exposure as well.
cuv3br,"NTA, you asked her to stop and all she did is escalate. A birthday isn't a free pass to behave like that! (Unless she sprayed it by accident, in which case just let it go)"

cuv7wu,"NAH - making different lifestyle choices is completely valid, and while her career makes you uncomfortable, she is not an asshole for expressing interest."
cuv94h,[removed]
cuv9me,"NAH. They're two different people. If someone were interested in dating one twin, would they have to date the other too?"
cuvaeq,ESH: two grown ass adults fighting over slices of cheese.
cuvavk,"NTA. Unless she's going to a showing of *Hamilton*, she should have been able to get tickets on another day. And if it's a theatre series, she can sell the tickets for the one show to come to your birthday brunch."
cuveg7,"NTA. you’re protecting your girlfriend from what could’ve potentially (and would most likely) make her relapse. the girl is literally pushing anorexic behaviors and thoughts into your girlfriend, you have every right to be mad about that."
cuvey6,"NTA

You will never win against a defensive arguer, it also probably does help that most parents, like your mum, adopt a ‘because I said so’ mentality and don’t like to be proven wrong by their kids"
cuvijn,"NTA: its a funeral, not a costume party"
cuvkw3,"NTA. If you and your fiancee are on the same page, that's all that matters. From the sound of it, you wouldn't even enjoy this wedding you planned."
cuvo4n,"NTA. Your Dad is taking out his frustrations on you, and that is not cool. Neither is punishing you for something you have no control over."
cuvqft,[deleted]
cuvuev,"NTA 

They lied about you and treated you like crap and they still haven’t reached out to you even now, if the illness isn’t a reason for them to reach out why should it be a reason for you to contact them ?"
cuvv5a,"So you’re patient with his beliefs, but he got upset when you expressed yours? NTA. This guy sounds like he grew up in a Jesus bubble and whether it’s you or someone else, it’s gonna get popped. May as well be you since you like him."
cuvwmk,"YTA, not for watching porn, but for being over-the-top open about it. You said you don’t want to think about whether or not your sister watches porn. Probably because that thought makes you uncomfortable, right? Learning about any of your family members’ porn habits would probably make you uncomfortable, right? So how do you think your parents feel about having your porn habits thrown in their face?

Learn to wipe your browser history, get a pair of headphones (doesn’t matter who’s awake or asleep, blasting porn at full volume is a dick move unless you live alone), and keep your private habits private."
cuvx2x,"NTA.  You get to choose your fb friends, and no one is entitled to that."
cuw2lk,"NTA, but think carefully before you ask for rent. Do you actually want her around that much? If she's paying rent (even a token amount) she'll probably start making herself even more at home, and it could get very annoying."
cuw4zl,"NTA. Only do it if it makes you feel good. Not your mom--you. 

It sounds like he's not in any immediate danger with his health, so you're not going to his death bed. Frankly, it sounds as if your mom is holding on to the relationship more than you are."
cuw5dv,"Stay out if it. This is ridiculous. Speaking as someone who has had three miscarriages, you are going to get babies shoved in your face. It is horrible but you have to learn to deal with it. If this woman is ""protected"" from this one baby it will make no difference. Stay out, it will only backfire."
cuw6vi,"NTA

The title really buries the lead here. It’s not just a new friendship, it’s a friendship with someone that has caused significant emotional damage to your/your family’s lives and that your friend is fully aware of because you chose to confide that information to her.

I wouldn’t blame you for distancing yourself and cutting her off. She really crossed a line here."
cuw8u2,NTA showing up late to a surprise party sucks. He had his own way of getting there and he could have either told his boss he had to go or asked her to hang on a minute to talk to you
cuwbtw,"NTA  


But your mom is probably anxious about you leaving, and is lashing out at this incident because it reminds her of your independence.  I'm not sure about your relationship from your post, but you aren't an asshole for having a job and picking up shifts.  If she really had something planned, she should have told you in advance because that would be respectful of your working schedule."
cuwec6,NTA - that's a big commitment financially. You don't have to be the wedding to support her.
cuwgbv,"NTA. 

If John doesn’t have any balls, you have to be his balls *for* him. Do not invite drama to your wedding."
cuwi99,"NTA

This sounds like some version of MLM.  She wanted your husband selling insurance as her underling so she could make money.

Block her."
cuwikg,NAH with your gf possibly being TA deppending on how she acts in the future. I think you found a very reasonable compromise. Why should you cut your game night shorter because she has social anxiety? All the better for her to have some time to herself afterwards. With your solution she gets to spend as much time as she deems comfortable with your friends and then leave and you can stay as long as you want too. Win-win-win because the friends also win from having a well balanced friend environment.
cuwji2,"NTA. If he's really looking out for you, he should find a way to express concern about your smoking without insulting you. It sounds like you're English, so your response wasn't even all that strong."
cuwkck,"NTA. ""I can't say no to my girlfriend"" is not a way to run a podcast or any other enterprise."
cuwl3h,[deleted]
cuwlr4,"NTA

""If you think paying for part of this wedding means you get to decide the schedule for the wedding, we aren't interested in your money. We didn't realize you were trying to buy something from us, we thought you were giving a gift. We aren't interested in selling any part of our wedding."""
cuwlrt,"Imma say NTA. You never signed a lease, so you were under no legal or contractual obligation to stay. If he wanted you to live there so bad, he wouldn't have made things so intolerable. Family or not, no one should out up with that much shit at their place of residence."
cuwn5u,"NAH: there is a way to tell your mom the truth without hurting your feelings.  Telling her you enjoyed her time/company, and the vacation for the most part, but that you could have enjoyed it more and having Uncle around put a damper on things isn't a bad thing to say. In fact, your mom probably already knows all that and feels the same way. It's OK to be honest about things you didn't enjoy, as long as you aren't rude about it and pepper it with things you did enjoy.  It's all in the presentation. It's all in how you deliver it.

In management, when you tell people their weaknesses or things they need to improve,  you don't just jump in and say ""You suck at mopping the floor,"" you start with compliments, ""i.e.: I love your energy, you're great with customers, and you're one of my most punctual employees"" and then tactfully tell them what's wrong.  The same goes here. Don't just say ""I didn't enjoy it"" Because there were some things you enjoyed.  When she asks, tell her those things and then tactfully let her know that Uncle was a shitty addition."
cuwyrn,"NTA - You were honest about your experience with that person.

Oh well. It seems no good deed goes unpunished."
cux16w,"YTA. Your son is 11. You are an adult . Act like it. Your son made a mistake so your reaction was to throw a fit and stomp off like a child. Then demand that they follow you, and throw a hissy fit when your son was upset about that. 

Your husband is right, you need to get over yourself."
cux6do,"YTA, giving a joke gift bible is not going to work, especially not at her parents house with everybody there. Religion is sensitive and I bet she doesn't make that joke around her parents.

Keep your joke gift bible in your backpack. Next time she says: ""I need Jesus""/""I need a bible"" whip it out and gift it to her and laugh all together. She likely only makes that joke when she's comfortable with the audience. When she asked how long you've been waiting to make that joke back, tell her you bought one just for her around her birthday."
cuxefz,ESH.  Yeah she was being annoying. And was being an asshole for putting you in the middle. What you said was right. But the way you said it sounded like you were an asshole about it. Apologize for your tone. But tell her if she wants to know so bad about why Sawyer doesn't like her to ask him directly and stop putting you in the middle. And that it bugs you that she asks constantly about it.
cuxhng,"NTA, for filing for the child support that a court ordered him to pay. He is both an asshole and an idiot for thinking he could just ignore a court order like this, and whatever consequences result from you taking this action will be 100% his fault.

Everything else... I ain't touching that. Leaving that for a relationship sub."
cuxn03,"NTA. You didn't force your friends to choose between you and Josh. You told them how you felt and asked for their support, leaving them free to make their own choices. That's not manipulative at all."
cuxn9s,YTA you would be the asshole for mocking her. All selfies are for attention. Sitting in the ER is boring so it sounds like she's amusing herself with selfie posting. Not my cup of tea but no need to mock people for it.
cuxntm,"NTA. It was an order and she chose to ignore it. If you tell her not to touch you, she legally cannot (assuming you’re in the US). IVs suck for the most part, but more so when you’re afraid of needles."
cuxssq,"NTA

You have a pretty normal adult perspective."
cuxvp9,YTA - that’s his brother. Of course he would say something. It’s his BROTHER.
cuxx03,"NTA if the planning is still in the early stages and he hasn’t spent money, taken time off work to go to your bachelor party, etc.  I wouldn’t phrase it as “you can’t be in the wedding” but rather as “hey,  sorry to do this but I got a little excited and asked too many people to be in the wedding, would you be all right just being there as a guest?” Odds are he’d be just as glad to skip it, since being a groomsman is a pretty big commitment for someone you don’t talk to much anymore.

But if he’s actually done stuff to be in the wedding, YWBTA. You can’t go for a take back if he’s already rented a tux and bought plane tickets or whatever."
cuxxko,"NTA. Don't drive him anywhere, unless it's to therapy. Tell your parents to install a lock on your room. Or do it yourself super easy."
cuy2qu,"

cuy35m,"Info 

This sounds way too one sided is there any information you are leaving out"
cuy3hl,NAH. I think y'all need to communicate better. Explain to your family the constraints on your time and that it's sometimes easier just to see your boyfriend rather than them because their schedules don't always align with yours. Maybe you can use that as a springboard to find more common time to see each other
cuy87i,"NAH, those aren't unreasonable standards and you just wanna get your boi laid"
cuybb5,"NTA. 

Has this been a recurring theme with them throughout your life? Based on your description, it sounds like your parents are self-absorbed dicks. 
- They clearly have no understanding of boundaries.
- They provide only condescending opinions rather than feedback and support.

You've tried to establish boundaries. You don't want to hear about their sex-capades nor do you want to talk about your sex life. This is a very clear and understandable boundary. Especially getting out of an abusive relationship, the last thing I'd want is to talk about it with people who wouldn't fucking understand. 2 hours sex session? Fine, you do you, mom. But you sure as shit dont have to take criticism because that's not what you're in to. You and your parents are all adults. If you and 2 other adults were conversing about the same topic, it would be well within your right to inform them you are uncomfortable and to stop. If the other 2 adults had told you to ""to stop being a prude"" wouldn't you be fucking annoyed and cease being around them? As reasonable adults, all parties should have an understanding. From what you said, they don't give a shit about your boundaries. 

You being their child doesnt not change you being an adult. You do not have to put up with their shit because they are your parents. The relationship changes. Parents and Child -> Adults and Adult (with a history) idk best way I can explain it."
cuybjc,"Yes, YTA. Lying is lying. Also, you're not fooling anyone, smokers smell."
cuyd4y,NTA. Health can change at the drop of the hat. They need to deal.
cuyef1,"Awkward. Your last comment is on a r/gonewild post 😂 maybe should’ve used a throwaway for this one, buddy."
cuyh1r,"Kind of YTA. You should have been very clear when you reached out. “Hey dude, I can’t go. I can cancel the apartment now and we’re not out any money, or we can keep the reservation and you’ll be on the hook for the whole amount. What do you want to do?”"
cuyk48,"YTA If you say it like that. 

You should probably mind your own busines. You don't own the building and they can cook whatever they want ."
cuylww,"NAH

After I got over the shock and realized it was fake, it would be funny as hell.  But during that time I’d be mortified if my husband did this lol

Edited for correct vote.   Sorry guys toddler had my attention lol"
cuyp4k,"NTA- but I wouldn't make a scene. I would start at HR, because your boss might try to sweep things under the rug. Have your evidence ready to go, printed if possible."
cuyr9i,"YTA. You're not as clever as you think. You're ordering a menu item wanting a different price by making it a la carte. Problem is, the drink you're ordering is on the menu itself, so therefore it is not applicable to the a la carte pricing.

If you don't like it, don't order it and put in a formal complaint with the manager. But don't argue with the barista who is just trying to do their job. They might get in trouble if they humor your pricing scam."
cuytmq,NTA. Abusive family will try to convince that you owe them but you do not. In years to come you will look back as this as one of the best things you could have done for yourself.
cuyv8y,NTA buy the towels and leave the review you were going to leave which seems great to me.
cuywkw,NTA it's part of a parent's job to stop their kids from doing outrageously stupid things like paying $1000 for shoes.
cuyxl7,"NTA


She volunteered to put it on her card then canceled without mentioning it to you. She’s the asshole. 

Sorry that this happened, those character experiences are something else."
cuyya8,"NTA. If she had 2 good friends there who were sober you left based on the premise that her friends would watch her. Thats kinda how parties work.

IF she told you that she didnt trust the people there, you'd be an asshole for leaving but realistically, there doesn't seem to have been any reason to suspect her 2 good friends wouldn't take care of her."
cuyyaw,"NAH. You’re a grown up and you’re able to make decisions yourself, because at that age there are so many opportunities to take that can help you succeed in life. Your mom’s emotions are valid: she will feel lonely because you’re her only child and family (besides if you have any aunts or uncles that are still alive). However, she shouldn’t push her emotions and try to guilt trip you into staying because she’s lonely. You two lead separate lives.
If you can, try and talk to her again. Say maybe she could go out more, or you two could set up a system of communication via texting/calling at a certain time of the week. Even suggest to her that she should go out and make new friends, if she’s willing to.
I wish you luck on your journey and hope your mom doesn’t have to feel lonely anymore. ❤️"
cuyz36,Yta for thinking someone that age is old. Info: are you nine?
cuz46c,"YTA. You share the space equally, you pay equally. You are paying literally *half* what each of your roommates is paying. Your roommate feels like you are scamming him because you are scamming him. Pay up, dude."
cuzdcb,YTA. She made the terms of her consent for filming clear and you violated that consent. It’s really that simple.
cuzeda,"YTA. I don't think people don't like you cause you are so critical, I think they don't like you because you sound like an obnoxious know it all."
cuzfa8,">I'm not a confrontational person

Doesn't check out.  Also I missed the part where you made it rain."
cuzi0y,"ESH - Sounds like her family doesn't like you/takes advantage of you being polite and not rescheduling.

However, you're clearly bitter about it, and bitter about the past trips. If that's the case, start speaking up. They might even think (because you never let them reschedule to include you) that you don't want to come in the first place.

Either way taking this out on your spouse is shitty. Start getting more involved with them."
cuzifb,Um... no. NTA. He’s being ridiculous.
cuzkmp,NTA. Forced patriotism isn't patriotism.
cuzlhb,"Info. It depends on your relationship w your sister.

Just ask yourself if you'd be upset if the roles were reversed.

I'd be really upset at my brother. This is how ppl grow apart."
cuzlwr,"NTA. Just be gracious when she gets angry/hurt and decides not to come herself.

She is trapped in this relationship."
cuzo28,"NAH.  Stop worrying over made up scenarios.  If she asks to say, tell her how you feel about having visitors around."
cuzqf4,"NTA. He's acting like a spoiled child wanting a new toy. Have you looked into the insurance costs both for the bike and your health insurance? Some policies have a motorcycle clause because they are considered to be more dangerous than cars and trucks. 

You and he made a deal and there is a budget to contend with. You have children to raise and the two of you don't make enough money to be making financially stupid decisions. There isn't enough wiggle room to make a mistake."
cuzwco,"I don't even think the backstory matters in this situation, NTA. If you tell someone not to take pictures of you, they have to listen to that."
cuzwhl,NAH - I do think you could've just asked for Nair without pointing out it was for him since he was unwilling to expose himself. Don't think it quite makes you an ass.
cuzwz5,"YWBTA That’s essentially stealing. They price those meals assuming one person will be eating it, not the whole table. The restaurant can’t make money if everyone comes in and tries to game the system like that."
cv01al,NTA - but you have to ask the international students what they think and what *they* want to do. No where in your post did you say that you’re international so im assuming the visa thing doesn’t apply to you. Consult them since they’re the ones at risk here.
cv01qr,"YTA - You have 2 spots available and you're planning on potentially inconveniencing another person, who you've already inconvenienced once, just to be a dick. Park in your own spot."
cv032p,"YTA. You’ve judged the guy before meeting him. In your mind he’s either a “pathetic loser” or “conman” which speaks a lot of your mentality. He could be a whole range of other things, including “fine” to live with."
cv03nk,NTA. She’s 16. Get a Capri sun.
cv04gy,NTA simply based on the fact that she took your change and tipped herself... we call that stealing. Lots of other reasons NTA but that's the top one for me.
cv08d0,"Fuck no! 1000% NTA! going to a party, your OWN party! With people who called you a danger to their children? Nah. Your mother is TA for inviting those people in the first place! Hope you had an amazing birthday."

cv0k5v,"NTA - They went beyond their scope of work and damaged something valuable. What that thing is... simply doesn't matter.

Going forward, I would suggest a couple of things. 

1. Get your own landscapers if the HOA will allow. 
2. Get a spigot lock so they can't use your water or change your settings on that water. 
3. Go to your HOA meetings. Complain. Get involved. If you can, get on the board, and be a part of making decisions on things like hiring/firing the landscapers. (I say this as someone who successfully ousted an an entire HOA board and became president, and let me tell ya, things changed.) 
4. If all else fails have a lawyer draft a letter (on letterhead) with your grievances, and your expected payment. I'd include the market value of the plants, time you've spent healing them, the time you've spent cleaning up after the landscapers, and anything else you can think of.
5. Small claims."
cv0ldw,Sounds like you and your roommate need to switch bedrooms
cv0p89,NTA. Why would anyone bother to order online if they had to wait in line anyway? That doesn’t even make sense.
cv0quv,"NTA - you’re not his parent

Honestly, if I were you, I’d find a way to get out of the house on evenings and weekends so you’re just not there for them to leave the kid with.  Maybe then they’ll suck it up and be parents"
cv0ugc,"NTA. Honestly if it bothers her then just stop watching it together. I don't care what the topic is, when I watch a show with someone I generally don't want to have a conversation about anything during the episode, even if it's positive. We can discuss after the fact. If someone can't deal with that arrangement then we just won't watch together.

&#x200B;

As a side note:

>Fanservice is where the author puts their characters in costumes, poses, and situations that sexualize them.

Strictly speaking, fan service is not always about sexualizing the characters. That's certainly a type of fan service but it's not the end all be all."
cv10hg,"ESH- Venting online wasn't a productive way of dealing with it, but if you had phrased the question differently or if your mom had been the one posting I wouldn't have really cared about the social media angle. Kids vent online, and it's not like you called anyone out or insulted them. You just should've talked to your family in person before posting online, or texted each one of them if your anxiety made in person confrontation impossible. 

That said, your mother shouldn't have moved your things, especially if she saw that note. Also:

>those types of things shouldn’t be left out in the open, especially for potential guests to see

That quote made my eye twitch. She shouldn't imply that your anxiety is something embarrassing or shameful."
cv13q5,"NTA- she completely ignored you. Actually, actively did what you told her you didn't want. That's super inconsiderate and you have every right to not be enthusiastic about that."
cv1584,"NTA.

Sounds to me like your friend needs to start playing an MMORPG or Action RPGs. He's clearly bored of a core aspect of Minecraft."
cv17pg,"“Refused my advice to throw away her SIM card and delete her Facebook.” Dude, you’re a terrible influence. You move her from her parents and now want her to cut off all contact? You need help. YTA and it’s not even a question."
cv18rk,NTA. You’re doing the right thing just keeping your dishes in your room.
cv1bzo,"Sizing up a body con dress will just make it look weird.  Personally, I hate the whole everyone has to match thing.  So NTA"
cv1e73,"NTA If my parents hadn't respected my sister's wishes when she died, I'd probably have done the same."
cv1etp,"ESH, but you do suck less than your brother.  I also hate when people purposely burp loudly but he sounds so immature that you snapping at him and then clicking the pen is just pushing him to be as annoying as possible.  I don’t think you need to apologize to him though.  Next time, do your best to not escalate the situation and hopefully your brother will grow up soon!"
cv1fzw,YTA. Put your roommates personal property back in the right place and have an adult conversation with them until they understand the dangers of not locking the door
cv1h21,YTA for not asking even once during the interview process what the job entailed.
cv1js3,"YTA, not because you took a large dump, but because you didn't do anything after you knew it was clogged. There probably is a plunger somewhere in your office. If not, they're cheap.

Everyone's poop stinks. If you need to talk to someone about it, try finding someone who has experience in cleaning or has children."
cv1ka7,"NTA. You were respectful to the people around you. If he texted you that there was an emergency, you could have taken the call, but seeing how it was just to check up, you did the right thing."
cv1lc0,NTA - People shouldn't just expect things. If it's really an issue just get something small and inexpensive for your mother.
cv1n6p,ESH from how you typed it it sounds like your trying to control him which is shitty. Hes being a prick by neglecting you. You would not be an asshole for Bringing it up like an adult. Dont dissolve it into a argument and start yelling. ( that goes both ways if he starts yelling tell him your concerned and that's why you brought it up ) people usually calm down when they are told that.
cv1oti,"YTA.

People who unfriend their friends because of stupid shiz like are AH's. Period. 

Guess what? People are allowed to have different opinions than you. Or are allowed to question things. God forbid you value a friendship enough to allow some difference of opinion, or even have a meaningful discussion where he or you could learn something. You could have just as easily called him up and said ""Hey let's grab a coffee and I can explain why the controversy doesn't make sense in this case"""
cv1pbl,"NTA. 

One thing I’ve seen a lot on here and reminded myself of frequently: an invitation is not a summons. 

It sounds like you explained the issue to them- they have chosen not to take it seriously. Your friend’s feelings might be hurt, but that’s better than torturing yourself and causing psychological harm by being around your abuser. 

Honestly, they sound like shitty friends (if they know how she treated you)."
cv1r7c,"ESH. 

You all suck honestly.

It may be a little tear, but you dont get to decide what is a big deal, and what isnt. 
You're 25 and living in their home. Id expect you to help out because, you know, you live there. 

You cant bring up the kids. Its not your mum you're helping out there, its your sibling. If you dont like it, dont do it.

105 pound dog weighs more than i do. I find it hard to believe its a tiny tear. Either way, they're allowed to be upset over their things being damaged, and its not fair for you to dismiss their feelings on the matter. 

Comes down to, if you dont like it, you're an adult. Off you trot. 
Your dad obviously likes the status quo or he wouldnt still be there.
Just because you dislike the current happenings doesnt mean he does."
cv1r8b,"YTA, kind of. Why wouldn't you want your friends to meet your BF?? That's super weird."
cv1rqq,"NTA 

If your roommate is okay with it, it’s fine. You both pay to live there so of course you two have to respect one another and come to an agreement. So if he is okay with it, then so be it."
cv1ty0,Ooooof girl get outta there and find someone that won’t leave you with all the burden NTA
cv1x9m,"YTA Sounds like your life style is not appropriate for owning a dog in the first place. It's not her responsibility to take care of YOUR dog nor is it fair for your roommate to look after it for over 2 months, also its not fair to the dog."
cv1yow,If the PS4 is yours NTA. They can purchase a streaming device.
cv24v6,"YTA - If you can’t handle a few kids and your dogs without your wife’s help, you shouldn’t have had kids or got dogs.  Man up, it’s only about two hours."
cv25b2,FYI: there are neither ‘political’ nor ‘religious’ reasons for not vaccinating.
cv26q9,"Not the asshole to be irritated, but YTA for thinking that he can't have conditions for paying your overpriced tuition. If you don't want your tuition to have stipulations, pay for college yourself and look forward to having to work your way out of debt afterward all because you couldn't wait for a tattoo. You can't suck it up for four years to get a free education?"
cv272j,"Yeah, maybe they just like the vibe your family gives off.

How about you get to know jill?

How about you prize open your heart a little more?

Either way, this is a pivot point of many things

Choose your direction after much consideration. NAH"
cv2cjd,"NTA, your vacation time is precious."
cv2d9z,"NTA they didn’t inform anyone that they were getting a cat. Now, you’ve had a trial period with it and found out the other roommate is allergic. Your ask is perfectly reasonable. 

I don’t know how attached your roommate is to this cat — but I would also prepare for a chance of them leaving along with the cat. Not sure what the lease is like, but that’s always annoying to handle. But it’s probably for the best.

Also, not trying to be rude but letter names are really hard to follow. I recommend giving them names next time."
cv2fmq,"NAH, but it sounds like your sister has had some kind of untreated mental condition for years (possibly related to the brain injury but maybe not) and has been self-medicating with drugs and risk-taking. Maybe the injury did something to her personality that wasn't initially noticeable. So I can see where your aunt is coming from, but as someone who has been on both sides of it, it's hard all around."
cv2lap,NTA.  Laundry rooms suck and the person needs to monitor their wash.  You made the best choice for the situation.  In college we would bring a grocery bag just in case someone hadn't touched their laundry in hours and we needed the machine.
cv2t59,You’re overthinking it. NAH. He was in denial so it was “no big deal “. Until it became real. Forgive him and help him through it.
cv30m8,"NTA unsolicited advice is always an asshole move. They should focus on their dog and their life, not your mom's. Definitely nip this before it gets worse"
cv3aia,YTA your cat wants to support you while you take your dump. **he just wants to be there for you**
cv3luh,"Nta. I was going to suggest you possibly have your sister stay with you, but you ended up mentioning that. I think it's a sound plan. Shes an adult and there should be help put there for her to find low income housing."
cv3udv,"NTA, if she's shouting at you, she doesn't respect you and doesn't have thr patience to be a tutor. That being said, it might also be because she's your sister, she might be an excellent tutor to people she doesn't feel comfortable with yelling at.  Just tell her you don't appreciate her yelling at you. If she can't handle dealing with you professionally, then she can't be your tutor. Does she yell at other people she tutor? 

My oldest brother was the same way, he was incredibly smart, but also super impatient when you don't see the same solution he does. Hey, dude that why I need a tutor, if I can get this as quickly as you do, I wouldn't need help."
cv3w3p,"NTA.

They say blood is thicker than water. I've always had the same mindset as you. If someone wants to screw up your life or not be a part of it, blood means nothing. You had no obligation to tell her. It's your life and she isn't entitled to anything."
cv3xm0,NTA. Seeing a stranger trying to enter your house is a pretty solid justification for calling the cops.
cv40hl,"YWBTA. You two have time to see each other once she's well rested. Do you really want her driving with a migraine, putting herself, you, and other people in danger on the road? Do you really want the first time you two see each other to be when she's sick with a migraine when she should be home resting?

She came up with a good compromise. It isn't like she stayed up late partying. It was no one's fault that circumstances ended up with your having to wait a tiny bit longer to see her. Respect her health, and you'll have a better relationship."
cv43cq,You're a good person.
cv45b6,"NTA, they were so out of line. I wish more people would stand up to assholes who pick on others like that."
cv47pq,"NTA. You could have not taken her and they could have ate $1000. You offered to give her some compensation. You don’t get wrangled into paying another $400 and driving 10 hours because you enjoyed watching your girlfriend have fun. You didn’t plan any of it, her sister got sick last minute. This might be a sign for you."
cv4846,"""No, we want a hotel room so we can have privacy and sleep better.
When they reiterate staying at sil's house
""No, we want a hotel room so we can have privacy and sleep better""
When the mom begs and pleads
""No, we want a hotel room for privacy and sleep better.
Don't waiver. Same answer every single time! 
Something fishy weird is going on with sil. A lot of us with young kids would prefer family to stay on a hotel! No deep cleaning!"
cv4b5t,"NTA. They promised you one situation when you started work, but now that you’re there, they’re trying to walk all over you. Don’t let them. However, just because you’re not being an asshole doesn’t mean they won’t fire you or get pissed for some reason."
cv4d0z,"NAH, but...

Price good bras, and then tell me a girl doesn't need to pay $50 on underthings.

Plus women's clothes typically do cost more then the equivalent for men, and men's clothes are often sturdier. (So your daughter might have needed replacement items that her brother did not.)

There can even be tax differences, depending on where you live. In Massachusetts, men's belts are considered a necessity and there's no sales tax. Women's belts are considered fashion items, and there is sales tax.

Maybe equal dollars is not equivalent in this case. I think you had a nice idea, but it might need a bit of tweaking."
cv4elq,"This is not a decision that Reddit should be making for you. The chances of someone here being able to offer good sound advice based on personal experience are very slim.    
This isn't a question of who is or isn't an asshole. The only way you'd be an asshole is if you didn't try your best to do what's best for the child. Regardless of which choice you make, be prepared yo second guess yourself periodically forever. It's a hard, hard choice, but it's one that your family, not the Reddit community, has to make and has to live with.     
I'm gonna go with NAH, but I hope you come to realize that it doesn't matter how I, or anyone else in this thread feels."
cv4f41,NTA- that’s super gross. She should have just soaked her feet in some water if they hurt.
cv4f7i,"NTA

Accidents are caused by drivers doing things that aren't the norm. No one on the road with you is expecting you to stop in the middle of the road. You may know why you are making that choice, but you're the only one."
cv4j5k,"NAH, yet.

Foreword: I am trans. This shouldn't be necessary to say, but given how these threads usually go, it probably is.

Having a friend who has a crush on you when you can't/don't want to reciprocate is uncomfortable for everyone. I've had it happen to me and it's awkward. He's always asking me to go to <place> at <time> and while I'm sure he means well nobody can guarantee they're truly purging their romantic interest for you just because you said no.

You're being the responsible adult here by coming clean with your discomfort.

Your friend will be the asshole if they make it into a transphobia issue. Both an asshole towards you for making you feel guilty over nothing, and an indirect asshole to other transgender people who have experienced real transphobia."
cv4m1o,"Not going to lie. 

If one of my employees showed up high as hell, I’d be as angry as they were high. Going to work intoxicated isn’t OK. It’s just not. 

Business wise? If one of my employees said that I overreacted, I’d take stock of how I handled it. I would ***never*** tell that employee they shouldn’t have talked to me. 

I think this is a case of the coworker is TA. Why? The boss might be unpleasable. He might be a jerk. Heck, he might be TA in lots of situations. 

However. It’s a huge issue. Driving while intoxicated is incredibly unsafe and anyone who does so genuinely ought to be scared out of it until they never do. High is treated as better than drunk, but both can kill or injure others. 

The boss might also be TA most of the time."
cv4s28,"NTA

I am clingy. I also suffer from depression.

Neither of those things gives me a free pass in a friendship. You're doing neither of you any good by sticking in a friendship you don't actually want to be in (if I were your friend, I'd actually want you to be upfront and tell me that you're not having it anymore, but somehow I don't think your friend will react positively to that). 

Dewit. It's your life to live not theirs."
cv4t29,"Morally, NTA. You're an adult, you paid for it, it's yours. She's being unreasonable and controlling. Logistically speaking, think carefully about whether you want to open this can of worms while you're living there. Depending on your own financial situation and how you think your mom will react, taking a principled stand on this might or might not be worth it."
cv4ujw,NTA but be prepared for not seeing your friend very often.
cv4yzi,"NTA. That's passive agressive manipulative behaviour.  


She'll try to be back. Don't let her."
cv4zux,"NTA it sounds like you have already made your mind up. He’s bad for your mum, sibling and yourself. It’s a no brainer to get rid of him

Edit: typo"
cv558e,"NAH. It happens, we try to be helpful but sometimes it isn’t enough. The guy was kinda rude for giving you a look, but whatever, at the end of the day, there’s no assholes here."
cv55pe,"As a former stage manager, YTA if you quit, even if you don’t think you’re important, everyone is a part of the puzzle in a production. However, with that being said, you’re totally not TA for wanting to quit, this sounds like an extremely toxic environment and NOT what theatre is all about. You’re so close to being over and done with and you made a commitment when you became part of the cast that you’d see the end to it with these people. I believe in you that you can make it out and finish strong knowing that you didn’t quit. And guess what, right after closing night, you can never work with those bullies again and move on to a company that will actually value you."
cv56op,NTA. You were well within your rights to repel this person.
cv59pg,NTA. It's not your problem that your brother is unorganized and apparently pretty entitled. It's his responsibility to take care of this himself. Airbnb is a good solution if he doesn't want to stay in an expensive hotel.
cv5acy,ESH. Literally everyone. You need to buck up and tell the kid instead of hiding inside your own home. Kid needs to understand boundaries. Husband needs to back you up. Mom needs to do more parenting.
cv5ape,"YTA. Don’t make racist jokes at work. Especially if a coworker asks you to stop. Maybe something you and your friends feel comfortable with, but your coworker obviously doesn’t. Your state law probably would require your employer to get you to stop if your coworker complains. If you can’t do it for their sake, do it for your own."
cv5b0w,"YTA, you decided to keep property that wasn’t yours instead of doing the moral thing and have had a run in with karma."
cv5c3u,YTA now that’s not me saying don’t do it because you totally should but yeah you’d be the asshole.
cv5dey,"NTA.
You can respect someone's religion without participating in it. If anything she's the asshole for trying to force you guys into her religion."
cv5dlj,"NTA, it’s not your job to make up with them, they were in the wrong. Accept their apology and act normally, if they continue to act weird it’s on them."
cv5fp6,"NTA
I went through a similar situation when attending university and dropping out was the best decision i made for myself especially my mental health. I took a few years to work and think about what I really wanted in life, then found a job making more money than I would have with the degree and I'm so much happier now. My mom wasn't impressed for a while but I always made sure to explain to her its my life and I need to do what I feel is best for me. 
At the end of the day you are the one who has to attend the classes and put in the work, and if it's not working for you that's okay. Hope it all works out OP!!"
cv5hay,"FYI ""regular"" stores like Wal-Mart can't force you to have your receipt checked. Membership based stores like Costco or Sam's Club usually have the receipt check built into the membership agreement."
cv5hus,"I don’t think this happened.

I only say that because this is something everyone reading will immediately get angry about and jump to your side, thereby allowing you to profittttt"
cv5nmt,"YTA for this passive aggressive nonsense. You're an adult, and so is your boyfriend. When someone is behaving in such a way as you describe, you use your words to have a conversation, you don't sulk around muttering under your breath making your own racket. You can start with, ""hey you were really noisy last night and it kept us up all night. In the future please keep it down."""
cv5o73,"NTA - Just Google ""Twitch streamer caught hacking""

All the stories you see where eventually someone is caught and it all blows up publicly.

You've already stated that your friend is inconsistent and you have a good idea when he's using the bot and when he isn't. Think you're the only one who's noticed something fishy?

Talk to him again, show him some of the articles of others getting caught, maybe get another team mate onboard purely to help him delete the bot and if he still refuses then reporting it to the team should make him understand the story of Icarus without publicly shaming him online."
cv5pvy,"NTA, they’re parking illegally and blocking people in. This is what tow trucks are for. I’d say you might wanna have a conversation with them first but obviously then if you do tow them it might make your living arrangement a little uncomfortable."
cv5q38,"NTA. Just because someone has a baby or small child does not guarantee them special privileges. You didn’t make the child, as a result it’s not your responsibility. Plus everyone else had the same opportunity to offer their seat as well and didn’t. If your sister was so bothered by the situation, she should’ve offered her seat instead."
cv5wm0,"Lol this has a really simple solution.

""Excuse me,do you mind if I try and order in Spanish? I'm learning the language and want to practice"""
cv5wyj,">where she explicitly said not to bring alcohol in the house.

It sounds like even though you don’t recall her saying it explicitly, you knew that she wouldn’t appreciate it, at the very least.   If so, I say YTA.  You’re living there for free.  Don’t pull bullshit of trying to get away with something just because “you weren’t told otherwise”.  Those are games for the immature."
cv5xh8,"NTA

You aren't a mind reader. I would however take screenshots of those posts from your boss and maybe speak to someone from HR about the whole situation of you can."
cv6535,"NAH, nobody likes when people are condescending, which is how I'm sure it feels for you to be told something you know to be untrue. But others aren't comfortable agreeing that you're fat, because it's a rude thing to say about someone, because thry dont want to make you feel shitty about yourself, and because being called fat is probably in the top 5 of things people get really pissed off about hearing."
cv66rn,NTA. I think you already know what to do. Good luck.
cv67ez,"NTA. You were there to see a movie, you deserve to see it. You could have said to her that you were staying and she could watch it later."
cv6aih,"NTA - You're an adult now and capable of making your own choices. If they are literally going through your things as you describe, they are being quite invasive.

At some point, they need to learn boundaries."
cv6b05,"NTA. I don't know if a foxy would be more expensive but it sounds like he may have been scammed by the breeder. Fair to point it out the first time; however, from now on let it go. If your friend doesn't want to face reality you can't make him."
cv6c7g,"NTA

Your parents' behavior now and in the past is a direct threat to your mental and psychological health. 

No contact isn't about punishing the other person. It's about protecting yourself from further harm.

(((HUGS))) And please feel free to jump over to r/raisedbynarcissists. You will find a very supportive community."
cv6caa,"NTA - particularly based on your edit addition, it's pretty clear that her adoptive mom made an agreement she's now going back on, an agreement to allow your bio mom's family and her daughter to have a relationship. That's not just an agreement between her and your mother, it's a promise she made to her daughter, your sister, without her knowledge, that she'll get to have a relationship with you. A promise she's now breaking. 

Clearly, from what you've said, she has no legal basis for depriving you of that relationship, and i think you're ethically entitled to approach your sister (in person if possible, this is not news that should come via Facebook), now that she's an adult, and let her know the truth. 

There's no guarantee that she's going to like it, or that she'll even believe you, and no guarantee she'll want a relationship with you or your other siblings. But she deserves that chance, and so do you."
cv6fln,"YTA - why are you giving people conditions to be invited to your dinner? You either want them there or you don’t, and what they eat is none of your business as much as what you eat isn’t theirs. 

I’m vegetarian as well but I wouldn’t police what people can and can’t eat. If it’s that much of an issue for you, maybe book a table at a vegetarian or vegan restaurant."
cv6lec,"The 'Dealer' who ever it is must never fack about with the deck ,or deal the turn and river at the same time as the flop , leaving them face down for later.

If you do shit properly these situations will not occur. NTA"
cv6nze,"NAH
Except for the friend that introduced the replacement. Rude!

But I think sometimes friends just grow apart. It happens, I guess. You wouldn't get much out of fighting for that friendship because they seem to have moved on.

It was still pretty nice if one of your friends to call you. But I think they did it out of politeness.

You should probably search for other friends in your area."
cv6olo,NTA - if he’s in good health he has nothing to worry about. If he’s not then he could kill someone. Worth it I think.
cv6rkt,"NTA, it’s your sisters mess. She even took verbal responsibility for those dishes. If they don’t get done it’s on her, not you."
cv6wgo,Can we make a new subreddit called AmITheAssholeTeen?
cv6xpe,"NTA. If you really want to help him, tell him this shit is gross and people don't want to be around him. It'll hurt him and be so so awkward.  But it will likely help him a lot in the long run"
cv70xr,">its filled with animal products


>i love my some of that goddamn shrimp paste fried rice.


This is a bit contradictory, just pointing that out."
cv77t6,"NTA. Sounds like you are fully contributing to the household. Also, presumably you have to pay more to insure your car if parking on the street, not on the drive? Although I suspect you could wash the car with a bucket, it's a pain when the useful space is being used by a car that isn't. Why has he bought a car if she doesn't drive? Does she want it kept? Can you all sit down together and come up with a plan for it, express your frustrations? It sound like keeping useless car on drive is a waste of everyone's time and money so you wouldn't be an AH to point that out."
cv7lhz,"NTA
They're blopdy kids it's not their place to judge your decisions. I'd understand if this was toys/presents some shit but you need to nip this in the bud RN or you'll be growing Karen's or something. That's an entitled b growin there if they keep thinking that way.
They are NOT entitled to your money, you spend it however you like.
Also I think your shopping was  very reasonable."
cv7n76,"NTA! If they haven’t let you know in advance, like they usually do, that they want you to work, I wouldn’t go.

It seems like there was a pattern of asking the day before and they haven’t done that now."
cv7oj5,"NTA

You lent your friend your car and then it broke down when she was using it... Honestly at that point it was pretty up in the air who paid for the mechanic, but you went and did it without issue. She then decided not to do what you wanted and add an $80 fine on, because she was tired, not even by accident or anything. She then refused to pay for that? Yeah, she's the A-hole and doesn't sound like much of a friend either."
cv7z9n,NAH. If she doesn't smoke she might not have a clue what they cost. It was left behind and it's something you put in your mouth. I can understand why it was treated differently to a phone or a wallet.
cv82nw,"NAH. It wasn't wrong of you to exclude her from it, that is entirely up to you, but it also isn't wrong of her to feel hurt by this and deciding to take a new look at the friendship based on this. She has that right. And it sounds like she's handling it fairly adult, not throwing a temper tantrum about it, but instead just sharing how she feels and what her next steps are."
cv82xw,"NAH - Your parents pretty much nailed it. You're not an asshole for it but it wasn't necessary either.  


One could argue your sister was a little assholish because she doesn't have a point - that's like a person who got cancer by smoking saying ""See that guy is smoking but nobody gets mad at him, but when I smoke a single cigarette...""  


She got herself obese and already got to enjoy lots of stuff before - if not she wasn't obese (unless there is some really serious health issue at play but idk) - and you don't have to take yourself back because of it.  


Why do I still think your sister is not a a-hole either? Because it surely is frustrating and you have to keep that in mind. We all know that we can react in a way that isn't optimal when we're frustrated and it wasn't too bad either."
cv83aj,"NTA, you can't work with food until 48 hours after your last bout of sickness/diarrhoea. Your colleagues would be moaning if you came in and gave them it too."
cv83rt,"ESH. You for giving a recovering alcoholic, alcohol. Not even one is okay. Now you saw the behavior, which seems to be a result of that. Also, if she still has residual pain, and is on pain meds, that and the alcohol together is definitely a no no. Your mom sucks for not knowing her limits and being rude."
cv86cm,"No matter what you lied about, catfishing instantly makes YTA. 

The thing is though, you’ll be much happier with someone who loves you for exactly who you are, and lying isn’t a good way to start relationships. Just be yourself, there’ll always be someone out there. Don’t give up!"
cv8cxh,NTA: why are you planning to marry someone who doesn’t contribute to buying food for himself?
cv8ice,"YTa. Not for making him be financially responsible but for this

>I would shoot him cash here and there to make sure he can eat. Since he feels like I'm the asshole, then I should act like one and cut him off. Let him go hungry. Literally. I have zero financial obligations to him, my eldest or their mother

**You would let your child starve? Massive YTA.**"
cv8jok,"NTA

He's clearly taking advantage of your kindness and generosity. A guy who cheats isn't an honest person so it was pretty naive to trust him in the first place."
cv8mtp,NTA. You put all that time in organising your time for him to come over and he suddenly calls up to tell you he's not coming. Bit of a dick move from him.
cv8qre,"She lied because she was embarrassed, and your reaction just reinforces that."
cv8quu,"NTA - You never ever ever assume a woman is pregnant until someone confirms it. What are you meant to say anyway “Hey Jackie, you should maybe change because you look pregnant. Maybe something that doesn’t accentuate your fat belly?”.

I feel like if you look pregnant, it can’t just be your outfit’s fault anyway. You did the normal thing, people assuming she was pregnant were idiots."
cv8rff,"NTA. It sounds like they ask you not just because you're the eldest but be you're more obliging. I'm also guessing your female and a bit of a people pleaser. 

Start saying ""no"" to your mom on those late night teas. It sounds rather inconsiderate of her to ask you especially when you've settled down for the night (why can't she do it herself anyway). I'd also encourage a ""chore chart"" which will list what each person's duties are. Everyone in your family is old enough to help out. Some of it will need to be adjusted (not sure the 10F is old enough to do laundry but they can take out the bins, mop floors, vaccuum etc).

It is possible to limit your brother's time on the PS4. I find suddenly turning the off switch or the power off at the switchboard works as well as hiding the cables."
cv8rqm,"YTA

>I dont want to shame people for the way they dress

But that's exactly what you did to your girlfriend."
cv8sd7,"Right? How dare OP get his daughter 6 months of lessons in the instrument she wanted to learn? How very unreasonable of him. He should have bought her a keyboard and then just not bothered with her or it after that. /s




Getting lessons for a child doesn't make you an areshole. She wanted to learn he provided her with the lessons so she could do that and you're nuts if you think it's unreasonable"

cv8ugl,"YTA. She covers with a blanket and you are still uncomfortable? You gossip with your coworkers about it? What an ass. 
Babies need to eat multiple times a day. Every day. Breastfeeding is natural and the best option for both the baby and mother. You are a selfish, immature asshole. Listen to your girlfriend."
cv8wyx,"NAH  - but only because he’s losing his mental faculties.  That stuff would be wildly inappropriate from someone who was cognitively functional.  He is not .  He didn’t even recognize you.  His mind is going and he can’t be held responsible for the things he says.  Being highly irritable is another sign of the same mental deterioration.

You’re not the asshole for being uncomfortable and not wanting to subject yourself to it,"
cv8xni,"I wouldn't call you an asshole, so NAH, but you should be a bit careful with drawing Nazi stuff. People tend to be sensitive about that.

Plus, 9/10 times if someone draws a lot of Nazi stuff... they tend to be a Nazi. Or 12."
cv8y5n,"NTA: while you may not of been official you clearly expected an air of monogamy which was breached, best friends aren’t there to sleep with your partner and 8 months is a long time to be talking to someone. The fact they hid it shows they knew you’d react badly. Toxic people aren’t worth it, maybe over time you’ll forgive but right now you don’t have to and you deal with things your way"
cv96il,"NTA you didn't steal anything. She said herself she was lazy and slacking off. You put in all the ground work for 8 months. 

Please don't feel bad. You worked for this. If she really wanted that job she should have gotten her ass in gear.

You're a good person. Don't forget to be good to yourself."
cv96lf,"ESH

Since they asked you to take a picture of them off social media, you should have done that. That being said, they’re acting pretty ridiculous about their “fame”."
cv98nd,"Sounds like a selfish friend. NTA. You didn't respond poorly or anything. I feel on vacation it's entirely fair to not want to have to deal with your friends their problems all the time. Of course there's exceptions like if their family member died or whatever but this isn't close to that. 

Might be time to drop a friend to be honest."
cv99ef,"Eh, NTA but keep in mind there’s a difference between confidence and cockiness."
cv99j6,"NTA. I was ready to say ESH because taking and keeping someone's animal without their permission is wrong. But as you described, the cat sounds neglected in that home. 

You should still let the mom visit her from time to time. That would be fair at the very least."
cv9el8,"NAH, they did have the right to be upset bc its a kinda bad situation to be in. HOWEVER, you arent in a relationship with any of them, so youre also not in the wrong"
cv9ffx,"Bloody hell since when is aspergers a “disease”?! O_o You can’t catch it like the flu.
Take it from someone who has it (officially diagnosed) it’s not ‘terrible’ either. Good grief.

Anyway self diagnosees are pretty common, either people live somewhere with long waiting lists and it can take literal years to get the diagnosis (being diagnosed in your 30s-40s isn’t by any means uncommon) or it’s too expensive.

Not saying nobody fakes it (or is genuinely mistaken about it), but when the number of people who self-diagnose for legitimate reasons is as high as it is it’s probably best to take people at their word."

cv9krv,"NTA at all, you tried to be a good, polite neighbor by going over in person first and asking nicely. File a noise complaint. Keep being polite, and keep complaining until the problem stops. What you've described is unreasonable on their part.

Edit: If necessary for proof in an ongoing complaint situation, get it on video a few times if you can."
cv9leo,"NTA - you’re not required to be friends with anyone. It sounds like he’s not respecting your wishes and also your friendship. If he was really concerned that your GF is bad for you, there are healthier ways of having that conversation. How is he in other aspects of your friendship? He doesn’t sound like a great guy to begin with. 

Also pro tip: avoid talking about your SO to your friends. Even if they complain about their SO’s, friends can get overly protective easily. Also we all have a tendency to only talk about the bad, not the sweet stuff because that’s too personal or mushy. I’m just saying this from experience. It rarely works out for the best. When people get unnecessarily involved in your relationship, that’s when things can go south."
cv9lxs,"If it's illegal where you are, calling the cops was pretty much guaranteeing they'd be arrested."

cv9ojc,"YTA.

Here's the thing.  You're not wrong about the BS with sports always having plenty of money and the arts having none.  But you're focusing your frustrations on the wrong target.  You're insulting the football team, which consists of your fellow students, who are just following their passions, same as you.  Yeah they may suck, but I'm assuming they're trying their best, and aren't happy about losing.  You're just rubbing dirt in the wounds of people who don't deserve it.

Focus on your school's administration instead.  They're the ones that are prioritizing sports at the expense of everything else.  And be constructive, or nothing will ever change.  Passive aggressive snapchat posts will accomplish nothing, and may even hurt your cause."
cv9rou,"NTA. I would forgive him being captivated with cricket if it was a once in a life time deal (they rarely happen so sometimes it is THAT amazing), but he has dropped the ball on multiple occasions with you. 

I would talk with him about how this makes you feel."
cv9v3x,"Fellow messy person here, NTA. There's a difference between messy and dirty, and this roommate of yours is *filthy* if she can't clean up after herself she doesn't get to use your things.

cv9v8t,A lot of preventable deaths and injuries have been “one time things”

cv9xs0,"I would say NTA, but I might be biased since I’m in the same boat as you. I suffer from OCD, it was extremely obvious for my entire life and the fact that it was never treated contributed significantly to my anxiety and depression. Parents should dump the mental illness stigma and worry more about getting their children the help we need."
cv9zem,[deleted]
cv9zm9,"NTA. 

He should have stopped the first time you told him it bothered you, it's incredibly inconsiderate and disrespectful of him to do that. You should sit him down and tell him that it's not a laughing matter to you, no matter how cute he might think it is."
cva3hk,"YTA it’s really not normal to want to keep her away from your mom out of petty jealousy.

I had a friend like you in HS, I got along with her other friends really well and she got jealous claiming they seemed to like me more than her so she’d tell them they weren’t allowed to talk to me then blame me for her friendships being ruined.

It’s super self-centered and a personal problem that you need to work on and grow up."

cva5ty,NTA. You're 22. It's entirely your choice.
cva79g,"ESH. You asked if it was ok to see your sister on the day and you both agreed to the compromise. I can understand feeling frustrated that he is no longer happy with this compromise.

However, he was open and honest about his feelings. He shared himself with you. He communicated. The response you put here sounds like you focused on how you were affected *first* instead of acknowledging him. Frustration came first. 

>After a little bit, he tells me he is upset because he doesn’t get to wake up with me and has to church and breakfast alone. I called him a little selfish because of the situation but I understood his pain.

You both have valid points and feelings. You're both focusing on the way you feel at present as individuals."

cvaqt6,"NTA

And this is not a friend. 

Who TF calculates their time into what the other owes him for a shared adventure."
cvaqxu," NTA - a lot of people believe that you should talk to the person before reporting something like this, but I believe this situation is different. It sounds like these people (at least the customers) make you feel unsafe and by talking to them, you would not only be putting yourself in an uncomfortable situation but ALSO if nothing changes and you do have to report them, they would know it was you and could get hostile. They are clearly violating the law here and are making things difficult and uncomfortable for their neighbors. They know what they are doing is wrong. I don’t think it would be bad to anonymously report them."
cvax59,"NAH - Sure, it could have been dealt with better, but I’m thinking with the head of a 28 year old. I’m not sure many 16 year olds (certainly not me at 16) would have known how to deal with this situation tactfully."
cvax5w,"YTA.  Jesus, dude, hiding your brother's things and dragging him outside aren't going to help anything, especially when the resulting fight is depriving your poor mother of much-needed sleep.  All you are doing is tormenting both him and your mother.  

Your heart is in the right place, but holy God are you going about it the wrong way."
cvaxpj,"NTA

What the hell are these replies? It's your property OP what you do with it is your prerogative."
cvayuy,"NTA.

The seats recline, recline them.

I'm not shocked when a seat reclines in front of me. If I don't like it, I recline mine too for the room.

People don't understand how expensive it is to run mass transport. We pay a miniscule fraction of the costs. If we want a comfortable space, we pay for multiple seats. EG: first class, or a premium economy.

Otherwise, deal with it. We want cheap tickets, we make concessions in other areas. As in, legroom."
cvaz1d,"NTA

I'd tell them to bugger off and cut off contact. 

You could tell the roommate himself, just once, that as far as you are concerned the TV worked last time it was used by you & your responsibility ended when his Dad took possession of it. Then block all their numbers."
cvb1no,"NTA. Dude, this is a drink driver - you *need* to stop it however you can. They are the assholes, not you."
cvb1t2,"NAH. But why not search for alternatives before talking to her? Maybe she can go some place where she would be confident enough to do it. If you talk to her and show you did some research, you show you care and not that you just think it’s gross and that it annoys you."
cvb5r1,YTA. You didn't have to dump it on the counter. I seriously thought you were a 12 year old kid but then you said you had a wife. Jeez...behave like an adult. That employee was following policy and now has to clean up the mess you made.
cvb6a2,"NAH Everyone feels fatigue and frustration when caring for a loved one with any type of chronic debilitating condition. What matters isn’t how you feel, it’s how you act in person."
cvbabv,"Maybe it was really warm, so she took her clothes off? And she's diabetic, so the whipped cream was to counter low blood glucose? Also, a low blood glucose can mess with balance, so she tripped, fell, and landed on his dick?

Anyway NTA, I doubt Anna was diabetic anyway.

cvbgye,"NTA

Do you really think she would pay you if she won?"
cvbhrr,"This is not a good question for a non black subreddit that doesn’t understand the centuries long issues racism, colorism and Willie Lynch. Your pride in your light skin has a lot of problematic roots. I know I will get downvoted for this, so Im not going to go into detail, but please get a black sub perspective on this. 

(In short this can be similar to a masculine gay guy, getting the “you dont seem gay” comment and responding with “wow thanks!” In front of other gays)"
cvbjz6,"NTA

You were trying to do a good thing by keeping Dad in the loop and letting him know what was going on.  There's no reason for you to suffer ANY abuse for your decision to stop doing that.

If Dad wants to be a part of his kid's life, let him write you a letter about it and have him tell his girlfriend and his family and friends to LEAVE YOU THE FUCK ALONE.

It's good that you went to an attorney and you can work out a plan that will protect you and your child without totally removing Dad from the picture.  

And, by the way, child support, etc, should not be tied to Dad's ability to visit his child.  That's a totally separate issue."
cvbk8y,"NAH The dog has already bounced around enough, poor thing. The husband is the asshole here, obviously, but I don't think the woman really means any harm despite constantly changing her mind. She's in a transient situation which isn't a good one for a dog. Could you explain this all to her and then maybe send her a pupdate with permission from Ruby's new family?"
cvbsoh,NTA but also it sounds like your mom might have other undiagnosed mental illnesses that she would need medication for. Her paranoia is a big red flag
cvbvbd,NTA but you gotta take this down several notches. A LOT of notches.
cvbylf,NTA. This is your future we are talking about. They should have consulted you first
cvc17s,"YTA. People can't just up and change jobs. Reminding them that their job essentially sucks is kind of a dick move. I work in Healthcare. I know the system is broken, but I do everything I can to help my patients. Without people in the job who are actively trying to help, you're only going to encounter people who aren't even going to try to help you.        

Edited for spelling."
cvc1rp,"NTA- I mean, you’re wrong. Since you’re a minor, technically your brother destroyed your dads headphones, not yours, but in a year you’d be correct. He needs to start thinking about how his child impacts other people since he’s going to be financially responsible for his mistakes when they start impacting people other than his own dependents."
cvc2px,"Not enough info. It sounds like this was a smaller snippet / the tail end of a larger conversation that’s informing your friends response. 

Without knowing it any feedback you’d get here is going to be biased by omission."
cvc450,"This is difficult. I’m going to say YTA, but not a major one. You should respect your ex’s wishes. If she didn’t want to talk about what happened that month, then don’t try to force it out by contacting her sister. It would’ve been fine if you asked her sister if your ex was doing okay *at this moment*, but asking her to reveal information that your ex didn’t want you to know was bad.

I know you want closure. However, it your ex doesn’t want to tell you what happened there’s nothing you can do."
cvc52e,"NTA, he sounds like an abusive r/niceguy who's treating you as an outlet to vent out his feelings. You're his friend, it isn't your job to listen to his screaming/be his support coach."
cvc7r3,"NTA, the waiters are. Tour guides are often given scripts, so I wouldn’t say they were the AH. You told the waiters you didn’t know and they were AHs for gossiping and making your experience unpleasant."
cvcajw,"NTA Of course you should report him.  You should also make sure to carry some mace or pepper spray at all times.

Also, this is criminal harassment not just a workplace thing.  Report it to the police and get a restraining order against him (you might call it a peace order in Canadia)."
cvcbzf,"NTA, especially since one of your cats has already been lost. If that wasn't enough to convince him to be more careful, I don't think anything will. You should definitely try to get out of the lease early."
cvcfth,"NAH 
You didn't have the opportunity to pay due to lack of finances.

You should've spoken about it to the friend any it and if the friend was considerate wouldn't cause any problems."
cvclxq,"NTA- It’s your choice to stay where you want to stay. If he’s choosing topics that you’d rather not talk about, that’s even more incentive to head back home. The VA not giving him medication he needs does sound unfortunate but that isn’t an excuse for alcoholism, either. You’re in the clear here."
cvcowa,YTA! You chose your car over a human being. No wonder you guys aren’t together anymore.
cvd06e,"NTA

If they’re 16, I get it. If they’re a true adult, it’s inconsiderate and some places might fire over it."
cvd2zx,"NTA, honestly sounds really frustrating especially with the way your parents deal with all of that imo it would be justified"
cvd39w,No he was trying to swindle you. The report was necessary. NTA
cvd3u3,YTA but only because you would be doing yourself a disservice by burning bridges unnecessarily. They're out of you're hair now: stop responding to their messages and let the relationship die. You don't need to nuke it now.
cvd80c,"NTA 

Don’t be pushed around when you’re really tired."
cvdaw5,"YTA If you and your husband have been talking about this trip jointly why didn't you tell him before buying the tickets? It seems like this was from your joint vacation fund so he should have a say in the final decision as well. And then when he inevitably got upset about your unilateral decision you just completely bulldozed his feelings and took them anyway.

Also, manipulating your kids by asking them which one is better after your trip alone is super shitty. You and your husband both need to work on your communication and keep your kids out of it."
cvdb5e,"YTA he's an adult and you treating him like a child will cause resentment, if not the end of the relationship. You have no right to make decisions for him. As you aren't his parent or husband (and even then it would be wrong) you have no say in the matter."
cvdbny,"NAH. If it were a customer who bought it and resold it for more money, would they be ta? Tbh I don't think it matters if you work there or not. If your store really needed $1500 for the fridge they would sell it at that price. You're still giving your business $500."
cvdl8g,"Soft NAH until you can talk to a doctor and a therapist about this. Sounds like the both of you have gone through a lot with your sex life, and talking to someone about it might help you both understand each other's perspective. If therapy isn't an option, definitely have that conversation and tell your wife that you are still attracted to her, but that Viagra enhances the experience for you. I also mention a doctor because Viagra might have some side effects you'd rather avoid if you don't 'need' it to perform. I would definitely have that conversation at some point with your physician and weigh the risks and balances for yourself."
cvdliy,"YTA. One thing everyone should feel when they are at home is comfortable. There's no way a 14 year old girl should have to worry about random people in her home at random times with no real warning (I would count real warning as ""hey my friends are coming over tomorrow"" not ""hey my friends are here hope you read this message"")

Make plans ahead of time so everyone can respond how they want. You share a home so you have to compromise."
cvdlot,NTA. You'd be naive to hand a stranger on a bike your phone
cvdove,NTA. It's incredibly rude and selfish to push your religion onto someone else. You're not the asshole for refusing to follow a rule that oversteps your boundaries. Your parents are the assholes because they created said rule in the first place

cveepm,"NAH - I experience night terrors on a monthly basis. It’s terrifying. It’s horrible. I wake up screaming , often confused. I love having someone there to comfort me. But i would never expect my girlfriend to accommodate my sleep schedule. It’s helpful. It’s comforting when she’s there but I don’t expect her to be there and he can’t expect you to be there all the time. It’s not fair to anyone. Be there when you can. If he needs you come running. But you don’t have to be there next to him."
cvegz7,"NTA. In a one-pot dish, you don't fish out the bits you like and ignore the rest. This is one of those, ""What of everyone did it?"" moments. If everyone fishes out the best parts, there would be none left for the last people. 

It's just rude to take more than your fair share of any component of a meal, one pot or not, but it's especially rude to do it from a one pot meal, because it will throw off the balance. It was kind of you to assume she didn't know that it's rude, but frankly I think it speaks to a self-centered attitude. How would she feel if she were the last served and there was no meat left? Would she shrug and say, ""Them's the breaks,"" or would she be vocal about it?"
cveies,"NTA This reminds me of fathers I have heard say “I have to babysit my kid tonight.” dude it’s your fucking kid, it’s your responsibility to watch your kid you’re not “babysitting”."

Why don't you think the same thing about your friend who could have also added her.  

>Was I in the wrong here? Im really just caught in the middle and its not my fault. She is really a great girl otherwise.

Its your fault.  repeat: this is absolutely, 100%, your fault.  You put a girl and a guy who harrassed her together and then blamed for for getting mad.  This is absolutely the most idiotic thing you could have done with a girl you're interested in."

Sorry you're dealing with this."
cvevue,"NTA. Sounds like this ""friend"" only keeps you around to make themselves feel good and points out your ""flaws"" to make you feel bad. I would cut contact...

Learn how to pick your battles."
cvf3hw,"YTA. It’s fine to tell her you don’t want to have to take care of her if she gets wasted, but telling her not to drink at all is a little ridiculous. Y’all are a little uptight, probably just not a great friend match for the two of you."

Jesus. And I thought *my* family could be dysfunctional. 

You’re making the best of a bad situation dude, just because they created you/gave birth to you, doesn’t mean they deserve your eternal devotion.

cvfqu9,"NAH - sounds like he didn’t want to be friends anymore and that the boyfriend may have been an excuse to hang out less, but probably not the REASON you were hanging out less, based on the evidence that he wanted to end the friendship regardless. This however sounds like a really weird lie. He should be more upfront about how he feels instead of passively ghosting a friend over time."
cvfs45,"NTA. If the vines were growing over into your property and potentially damaging your bush/tree then you can do what you want with it. 

The neighbour has no right to dictate to you how you manage your own land. It's actually pretty selfish of them to expect you to put up with it

cvft29,"NTA.  Apartment living has drawbacks, especially when the units are close."

cvgw3c,NTA Dawn Dish soap (and most others) are non toxic because you’re using it on things that go in your mouth and you could possibly ingest.
cvgyrf,"ESH - you shouldn't have snapped and left, she shouldn't have pushed for an open relationship while being pregnant, her family shouldn't have held a grudge. Literally everyone sucks here. 

Anyways, even without money for a lawyer you have rights. Unless you're criminally insane, you cannot have your rights as a father stripped away from you. I won't go further because that would be breaking rules, but you could ask on r/legaladvice

It sounds like you want to do the right thing."

cvhegd,"YTA. The chicken is the premium ingredient in soup like this, and by picking pieces out of it specifically, you're throwing off the proportions for everyone else. It's like getting a scoop of cookie dough ice cream and then picking out the remaining pieces of cookie dough from the surface of the carton. That leaves a lower quality experience for the next person. The context is also important, that you're in your boyfriend's family home. I realize you've been there a while, but it's better to err on the side of being polite."

Going out and leaving six kids who had a rough day with one parent is iffy. However, not discussing with the other parent in advance makes one TA.  Even with one easy kid, I still find it courteous to consult the other parent beforehand."
cvhwux,ESH. You are totally right about the need for everyone to do their part in a hectic situation like that. But it sounds like you went from 0 to 100 faster than a Tesla.

cvi3dc,NAH. It's really not that deep. Families mess with each other. You'll live
cvi7bz,"NTA, your mom is.

I really feel sorry for you; it's really tough being the responsible child stuck with an irresponsible mother. You're only 18; she is the one who should be taking care of you, not the other way around.

Since you know how careless she is with money, the only long term solution is for you to keep your finances strictly off limits to her. Think of it as building up a safety bank so that if there is ever an emergency in your future, there is some cash to fall back on. It also sounds like she has fallen into the habit of using you as her piggy bank; it might be a good idea to cut that off to instil some discipline into her spending."
cvi8zm,"ESH - Your mother has been offering for a long time to do exactly what your aunt offered. I would be hurt too. She’s just trying to help you. But you have a right to do it with who you want, and your moms actions are a bit childish, as are yours."

cviol8,"ESH. You didn’t just insult his nose, you said he “had a Jew nose,” which is fucked all of its own accord. Therein lies the difference between defending yourself (hooray!) and being a dick (boo!).

cvix67,"Don’t go. You teach people how to treat you and unless they explicitly apologize to you for all the things they said to you, going will imply that you are ok and have forgiven what has happened. People always forget actions have consequences but you don’t have to forgive something until you are ready to and they apologize. As a note, something similar happened between me and a cousin and I haven’t talked to him in 6 years.

cvj8ob,"NTA you are nobody's keeper. She is not your responsibility even though you want the best for her. You just can't force someone to take your guidance. If you still want to be there for her in the future, just be open to her if she contacts you again. I bet she'll eventually apologize for how she reacted and if not...

You for not standing your ground on where you limits are and making it clear you didn't want to do this. It's not unreasonable to think that if someone is on the fence about going out, that going out is still an option.

It's also your responsibility to explain her behavior to the owner before you let her loose. Just a quick heads up. You don't have to give a whole lesson in husky behavior, but something quick like, ""She's a bit of an excitable nut at first, but she's very friendly. If you feel uncomfortable, I'll hold onto her again until she settles down some more."""

 I would say NTA, but maybe you should learn about social media yourself before trying to protect your kid on there or it may be pointless."
cvkn3k,"NTA. Your sons father is the asshole. If he can cut out his son for 4 years, not invite him to his wedding. He doesn't deserve your son or your time and effort. It's easy to see the new wife as the villain, but big picture, it's him. He chose a woman over his kid for years."

However, as a person who shares similar concerns as you do and has visited the US plenty of times, if you stick to the main cities and avoid bad neighborhoods you are going to be totally fine. And in the national parks as well. 

If you plan something super stereotypical like fly to NYC and stay in Manhattan - fly to San Francisco, rent a car, see national parks in California, drive to LA, fly back... it's going to be totally fine and you will never feel out of place or in danger.

Route 66 would not be such a good idea in my opinion. I don't think the long drive is so ""iconic"", just some places along the way, but the rest is going to be endless highway with nothing at all and shady motels which could reasonably trigger your anxiety."

I would say this is a classic cost benefit analysis though.

You’re overwhelmed and probably should’ve explained that better but you’re human. It sounds like this relationship is very one-sided and I would try to talk to your dad about that.

This is a majorly draining relationship and you don’t owe him all that emotional labor.

cvnunb,"NTA  


Frankly you may have saved yourself from a bad situation by not getting on the elevator with her.

I don't have time for women that wanna act like I'm a criminal waiting to strike."
cvny1n,"YTA Tbh. You wanted a rational conversation, but all you did was just tell her no, it's bullshit, I do not spend, I do not, you're tearing me apart Lisa. There are ways to have a lovely wedding for a decent price, you can budget where you can, there are tips and tricks you can research. As for the ring, yeah, it's important. You need to talk to her instead of just telling her off and then basically telling her you do not care about your wedding day.

What about possible bad influences - you gotta find out if they exist...and then seek for solutions. Best of luck to you both in this period!"

cvol4a,"NAH.  But you were rude, yes.

cvonwe,"NTA, but his comments are incredibly petty. They also make me think this isn’t primarily about the date- is he a little needy or am I reading into this?"
cvorvf,NTA If anybody is using homophobic slurs you should report them to a teacher.  G's behaviour is adding up to sexual harassment. Report that too. It's not your job to manage him. It's his teachers' or the head teacher's job. Having a disability doesn't excuse him and it doesn't mean you have to endure harassment or abuse.
cvotsg,"NTA. Z has serious fucking issues and I hope M gets out of that abusive and controlling relationship. You're in the clear OP, you and M did nothing wrong, totally normal behaviour.

Her mental illness isn't an excuse and as someone with bipolar, anyone who refuses to help themselves is ENTIRELY accountable for their shit behaviour."
cvowj1,"Going to go against the grain and say YTA, but not because you watched your neighbor’s dog get stolen. You sat there and watch this dog be put through these unsanitary conditions until someone else intervened. It makes no difference to the puppy. Not to mention, sleeping in its own urine and feces would make the chances of contracting a disease much higher. PETA isn’t the only organization you can call. Generally other animal control organizations are around that would be happy to help. I’m glad the puppy is in a better place, but it sounds like something should have been done a long time ago.

cvoza8,"YTA because of how you're framing it. You didn't say 'this is the only free evening we have so we will not always be able to come'. You framed it as 'this is not as important'. You are clearly feeling very dismissive about her cheerleading and think thst it's 'not like other sports'. Cheerleading is an immensely physically demanding sport with a high risk of catastrophic injury for participants. You have to take it seriously.

On the other hand I can see with so many kids if you go to every single game you would never have time on your own, so it would be perfectly fine to scale down across the board (pick one game per week or only important ones). But you are clearly singling out the cheerleading, so yeah, YTA"
cvp3nd,"NTA. You need to set clear, strong boundaries, though. Make it 100% clear that you do NOT want to discuss your health with her. 

She can keep all her worrying to herself."
cvp46m,"Unpopular opinion, but I think YTA. 4 years old is roughly when children begin keeping permanent memories. My earliest memories are when I was about 5. Ironically, it was my mom saying goodbye to me and I wouldn’t see her after that except during the summers. I grew up basically without a mother and I remember that memory very vividly. 

This is tough. But financial security won’t mean much if in the end she thinks her parents abandoned her. Then again, she might end up just fine. A tough call but I couldn’t do that to my child. He is also 4 and it breaks my heart to be away from him for a day, let alone a week at a time every week for the next two years."
cvp4za,"ESH.

Not your mom, tho.

You haven't given any detail about what your father and sisters do exactly, so I'll assume they are being assholes.

cvp9bx,"NTA- the mother thinks that the driver is always at fault, but the daughter was taught this way, and clearly just got pissed at you for taking her phone after being taught that it was okay to have it in the middle of the road. I understand not wanting to babysit her after what happened, she seems to have some behavioral issues"
cvp9ea,"Absolutely NTA. That's a big pet peeve of mine, people who refuse to make plans and then just expect you to be around IF they decide they feel like it. Your brother though.... man that is just weird. Does his entire life come to a screeching halt every time it rains ? Is he allergic to water ? He's a weird dude, and if he really can't stand to leave the house if there's even a chance of it raining, then he probably has some serious issues to deal with."
cvp9sf,"NAH. You aren't ""forcing"" her, but I can see how she might be irritated since she doesn't have time in the evenings. Your reason for not cooking meat, which is not wanting to be tempted, is totally reasonable. If you refused to cook meat based solely on principle that would be a bit different, but you're just trying to improve your health. 

There are some compromises though, people meal prep all the time. Your wife could cook meat on the weekends and then she could have meat for a couple of days at least (I wouldn't eat meat past like 2 or 3 days in the fridge, I'm not sure how long it's actually okay for) that she can heat up with dinner. I think meat in the fridge that you didn't cook would be easier to abstain from."
cvp9v8,"NAH - I mean, you would be committing a social faux pas to give your kid the same name as a close relative, definitely. The question is how much that matters to you? Me personally, I would name my kid whatever I wanted even if my own sibling had given their kid the exact same name. Others would never do that. It's up to you. But yes, there is a chance the cousins are going to react badly to it, so be prepared to deal with that. Whatever choice you make, own it."

Speaking as a seasoned foster, I would hope that the rescue organization would be willing to take the dog back and (hopefully) place one that’s more appropriate for you (and your experience level). That being said, they should also have resources/tools available to help you with this dog if you decide to keep him. My personal recommendation for a large, high energy dog is a prong collar. There are tons of videos available on you tube that are made by professional trainers to show you how to use this type of training collar. I would also recommend that regardless of what you decide to do, either with this foster or another one in the future, keep a new dog on a leash inside the house for the first couple weeks. This helps you be more attentive to the dogs behaviors, correct them immediately, and it sets very clear behavioral boundaries for the dog to learn. We always say that a new dog has to earn your trust and the freedom to walk around the house.

I’m sorry that your first experience with fostering hasn’t been ideal. I hope that you won’t let it deter you from continuing to help homeless dogs in the future.  And also, some parting advice: it’s ok to say no. Any rescue worth their salt won’t trick you, or force a dog on you that’s not a good match...they should be trying to do what’s best for the dog AND the fosters so that you come back to foster again after the dog gets adopted."
cvphv3,"NTA - Geez this story ended violently, sorry that happened OP. I understand why you left and in all honesty, it sounds like it was for the best.

I don't think it's unreasonable to expect someone to NOT be doing DIY at 3am...

I would love to meet someone who doesn't get upset when awoken at 3am to someone doing DIY whilst high to then start verbally abusing them and top the morning off with some child abuse."
cvpidv,ESH - You should talk to him about the situation not go behind his back to the owner of the house. Maybe ask to have house rules and a lease in place and if he breaks these rules he would have to leave
cvpnoq,NTA. You did the right thing. At this age you can't afford to take any chances.
cvpr34,"NTA. It wasn’t a serious injury, you made sure she was okay and planned to visit and help the next day. You’re Mom is being unreasonable and sounds like she’s having a hard time letting you fly the nest. Are you an only child? Or the youngest? It sounds like your Mom needs a pet or a hobby to put her theatrics into."
cvq13z,"NAH. My daughter is 8 mo so I get it.

 ""I feel sooo uncomfortable with now being asked to host this stranger for a day that’s really important to me.""

What do you have to entertain this person for every single minute they are there? While I dont think its right for the MIL to invite someone since its your party, you are overreacting."
cvq204,"NTA, they can get a hotel or airbnb"
cvq5e4,"NTA - while you might not be technically deaf, meaning you can hear and respond to auditory stimuli, you have issues communicating verbally which require assistance.

I would absolutely suggest going to your local deaf center, learning sign language, and seeing about getting TTY service for your phone.

I would also recommend having a pad and pen with you at all times, so you can get others to write out what they need to say to you.

And be upfront with people. ""I have a sensory processing disorder, can you write it down for me?"" or asking ""can you sign?""

But tools for the deaf are not meant only for the deaf."
cvq67z,NTA - Should not be sharing information like that on a personal instagram account all it takes is one person to know the person and the place and they could get a serious amount of harassment and a law suit for the company
cvq7rj,[deleted]
cvq7rt,"NTA. Once someone is grown they’re supposed to spread their wings. Keep doing well in life and show them that it wasn’t wasted. Regardless if you are using that degree or not, you learned a lot from going to school and every other experience you’ve had. Visit as often as you can and live your life."
cvq8ne,"NTA I was leaning ESH because you mentioned things have stabilized with your girlfriend and if you do something she asked you explicitly not to then it is disregarding her feelings on the matter and likely to cause an issue with you two. But this guy is an ass, that’s undeniable, he tried to cheat on his girlfriend, failed, broke up and tried again while knowing she was in a relationship. He’s untrustworthy and if he was willing to try this repeatedly i don’t doubt he’ll simply stop now. I can get where your girlfriend is coming from, but it seems based on how you worded it that she’s more interested in the impact on herself rather than this other woman."
cvqdjn,"NAH

It's just business and you have to look out for your own needs."
cvqf3i,"Given the current state of things, I imagine environmental science will be a very lucrative career in the years ahead.

Edit: as you're funding it yourself, it's your business... 

NTA"
cvqg9m,"""AITA for objectifying women with my friends?""

&#x200B;

Yes, YTA.  Your friends moreso for doing it just to annoy her further.  Grow up."
cvqgrs,"NTA, but damn dowries, really?  What country are you from?"
cvqmdc,"NTA for telling him. I would be so pissed if I found out someone knew my partner cheated on me with **MY OWN FRIEND** and didn’t tell me.

I think you owe it to your friend to frame it in a context that you heard of it via word of mouth and have no proof. You don’t want to act as if it’s confirmed only to have it be a lie."
cvqnle,"NTA - If you are going out of your way to help her, she should be putting in the effort to help herself.

Can only help those to help themselves.

Regarding your heated exchange, I'm not counting it towards judgement about not wanting to be ""holding her hand"" - Arguments happen and all you did was tell each other to STFU, hardly anything offensive..."
cvqs8c,"I'm gonna go with NAH, with a slight possibility you're the asshole. I'm a film lover myself, as are both of my parents, but they also love to talk during movies when the family is together. Do you know why they're talking?

They're trying to have fun. More specifically, they're trying to have fun with you.

For many, it is fun to shit on movies with your family. Dads in particular *LOVE* to be annoying during movies, because they think they're funny and they want to engage with you, their kid, to just giggle together for an hour or two.

You're fine for wanting quiet, this is obviously not your idea of fun, but you should understand for most families (not just yours), family movie night is more about the social aspect of being with your family than it is about critiquing cinema. Watch it alone later for the serious. Watch it together so you can make fun of that fat kid standing still in a dark backyard while obviously being stalked by a murderer. You're being a little uptight on this one."
cvqt15,This is a question for r/legaladvice
cvqtq5,"NTA  
James is making everyone of you ladies uncomfortable, that takes priority over the fact that a couple of the guys feel annoyed because another guy is being excluded."
cvqulc,"NTA, I think your mom is TA in this situation.  You're just wearing a mask because you're allergic.  Your aunt needs somewhere to stay and it sounds like her cat can't be placed at a friend's house or anything like that, since it's the type to hiss, etc. Rather than just explain to your aunt that your wearing a mask is nothing personal, so she feels welcome, she's creating a conflict where none needs to exist."
cvqvg3,NTA. It's not like you were purposefully trying to record someone's misfortune.
cvqvyc,[removed]
cvqw6z,"NTA - after reading your story I still can’t figure out if you were following proper line protocol or not - however, once people stood behind you you had effectively established new line protocol - and that woman was overly rude.

Everyone hates lines at craft stores, but it’s no reason to repeatedly call out a stranger, sheesh."
cvr16o,NTA and as a black person I'm finding it hard to sympathize with you. She's racist and you're an enabler. She is also clearly manipulative. If she didn't want to be racist she wouldn't be. Period.
cvr1db,"YTA. You're 20fucking5, and you can't let your mom sit next to her partner because ""you got there first?"" Bratty, entitled, and silly.

EDIT4EDIT: Because it makes sense for them to sit next to each other as a couple, and-- more importantly-- because ***your mother, the owner and driver of the vehicle, asked you to do so.***"
cvr2h3,NTA The only ones who get to decide this are the ones getting married and if you and your partner don't want too then don't do it.
cvr82h,"YTA, only because when you give someone a gift it’s up to them what to do with it. I can see why you’re irritated, but yeah prob way better to just let it go, unless you’re bold enough to ask for it back"
cvrdtc,"NTA but you might talk to your partner about it first, so he has the chance to bring it up to them in private."
cvrgbt,NTA. You don’t owe your time to anyone.
cvrgwn,"You don't have to ask them, but you should give them a heads up that it's coming. The installation will effect both sides of the fence and installers will have to clean up on neighbors property. Like I said not asking permission just a heads up."
cvrlqj,"Edit: NAH. 

INFO: How far away is this repairman? Will you be near his shop in the next week or so? 

For me, right now, it’s a question of proximity as you’re not under any obligation other than maybe a moral one. If he is nearby, I’d say he deserves something for his efforts. If he is very far, well — not testing before giving the phone back to you is on him."

cvrnbg,"YTA hate to tell you but people have attractions. I’m sure there’s models and actresses you’re attracted to, she’s attracted to celebs and models and she obviously has no chance with them and wouldn’t have an affair with them if she did have a chance. The fact she showed you everything means she has nothing to hide.

Just because she’s with you doesn’t mean she can’t find others attractive or crush on a model or two."
cvrpc7,"NTA, he’s being immature. You could always hold onto it until he grows up"
cvrq9d,"NTA for being disappointed. Really, NAH except for your daughter who is old enough to behave better. 

But let's be honest: you've got a teenager (multiple teens?) and THREE BABIES. You've got a lot going on in your life. There are a lot of elements here to organize. 

Perhaps it might have helped if you had more clearly expressed your wishes. Maybe you could have informed your SO in advance that you wanted some alone time to ""relax"" and sleep late in the morning. 

And that's too bad that your teen daughter missed the bus, but ultimately it was her responsibility, and she was being shitty about asking you for a ride. 

On top of all this, you say that special days induce a severe manic episode for your SO. It sounds like he avoided the manic episode, so things are getting better for him, but there may be a long road for getting to a smoother birthday experience."
cvrsk7,"NTA. Do it, but don;t expect a great response."
cvru9g,"NAH. However, since he offers to make you food, the least you could do is just ask him if he wants anything. It’s a polite gesture. He shouldn’t get so upset with you because when you do ask him, he says no."
cvrwv3,"YTA. I hate it when people shove their way in front of me in a situation like this. It's not their fault they're tall, and they shouldn't have to step back for you."
cvrz9b,NTA— you got in fair and square AND you got a letter and permission to redo the semester. Don’t listen to that teacher. Mental illness is hard but I believe in you!
cvs0yr,YTA. A man existing at a bar with a woman other than his wife doesn’t mean he’s cheating.
cvs2o0,NTA. Though a good middle ground might be offering to do it together so that he has a hands on opportunity to learn.
cvs34m,"NTA

You don't have to do anything you don't want to do when it comes to things like this, even if people are expecting you to do it."
cvs55j,"YTA

All you had to do was either ignore her or say "" sorry, no"". You are not obligated to give her anything, but your comment was pretty assholish. 

Also, I have given a pack of my cigs to homeless people if there are a few left in it if they ask for one. My friend roll cigs and gives a pack to the old homeless guy down the road in her empty cig pack. ( He refuses to take up offers of ride to shelter, etc. ) I do this because their lives are hard enough, they don't need a lecture . Just saying, just because they have cigs does not mean they are blowing $$ on them."
cvs5ab,NAH- he sounds dissapointed maybe when he cools off try to explain again! You have to do what's best for you and he should understand that too.
cvs5zd,"NTA

If you don't believe, you don't have to.  If your mom has a problem with it, it's her problem, not yours."
cvs7s1,[deleted]
cvs9n4,NTA but couldn't you have found a conductor / train assistant to report them to?
cvsa3n,NTA. She's clearly hurt you and you have no obligation to have a relationship with her (or anyone for that matter)
cvsba5,"NTA  It's not up to the server/delivery person to determine their own tip, it's for the customer.  The moment you ask for a tip, take your own tip or complain about a tip you're talking yourself out of a tip altogether. Of course she was lying."
cvsbi5,"Have you considered that if it is this much effort already that perhaps the two of you are not a good match? Yes, relationships take work but yours sounds like a slog from both sides."
cvsbj7,"YTA. It was petty of you to ask her to leave via text instead of just having a conversation and explaining why you were upset. And your sister was never *obligated* to buy these things from you. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement that is no longer beneficial to her since she's not going to be having kids.  Yes, theoretically she should have told you right away, but you should be more understanding that it was probably hard for her to bring up, and the baby stuff she was going to buy from you probably wasn't the first thing on her mind. 

It seems like your main issue with her is her not being understanding of your financial difficulties, but did she know you were having them? I can understand why you're upset that she didn't thank you for planning everything, etc., but again, she's clearly going through a hard time and perhaps she was going to thank you at the end of the trip."
cvsg6k,"NTA, you aren't obligated to listen to your friend's sexual fantasies.  She crossed the line, you asked her to tone it down.

She's embarrassed about going to far with it (most likely) and is lashing out."
cvshm6,"YTA. Not only is your constant harping about the situation - one that ultimately worked out for you - annoying your friends, it's also really insensitive to tell these stories in front of people who weren't so lucky finding a new place. I don't think your intent is to rub it in, but that's essentially what you're doing.

Yeah, they could have told you to knock it off. They were probably putting up with it, thinking you'd stop. But you must have been pretty insufferable to piss off two of your friends - including one so badly they don't want to be around you."
cvsm5f,"NTA - I wish we could play D&D together! My group fell apart due to adult scheduling troubles. You seem really thoughtful, most kids just have no real sense of dimension."
cvspaj,"> she cut me off saying I didn’t know what I was talking about and she’s grown so I need to back off and mind my business 

If she wants you to stay out of it, maybe you should stay out of it (i.e. not buy her a bunch of shit) NTA"
cvsptr,"NAH - You're not an asshole if you've changed, but neither is it weird at all that she'd be uncomfortable. It was probably quite jarring to see the contrast and she said as much. You seem a little flippant about the whole thing, so maybe that's why it seems a little tense right now."
cvsr49,"NTA, at that point you're basically a taxi service for your sister since you get no say on what vehicle to even use."
cvsrqz,"NTA, but I think you should go. If get in an argument you can just walk away, mom's probably stuck in bed."
cvsvyd,"NAH - You did what you felt was best under crappy circumstances. That doesn't erase all the hurt she probably felt. She moved on and it's a bit selfish of you to show up so much time later expecting her to hear you out. It would've been nice if she had, but she's under no obligation to. I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to make your own closure as well."
cvsxoe,"NTA you're at work. Keep it professional. If you told someone they were getting fired, as a manager I'd fire you first. Shit happens if he's not meeting the goals he should know what he's in for already."
cvsy70,NTA she’s mad she was caught. Thank you for having the courage and conscious to tell your friend. I urge your wife to stay true to her not succumb to pressure promises from “friends”.
cvt0cq,I would say NTA. I would be concerned for the kid too. I wonder how many times he has been shuffled to strangers houses and left alone. CPS probably will not get involved but if you make a report it will stay on file.
cvt587,"YWBTA if you ""make"" him. A good general rule is that if you're asking about ""making"" your SO do something for you, you're probably at least partially the asshole. Quitting is hard, but if he doesn't want to quit, you cant make him just so that it's more convenient for you to do so. Yes, doing anything that involves self control is going to be harder when other members of your household aren't doing it with you, but that doesn't obligate them to make the same choice as you to make it easier for you."
cvt6mz,"NAH, yet. Ask your coworker what they prefer. I would follow whatever protocol you follow when there is a second person with potentially the same user name: Sam Smith and Sarah Smith. There must be a protocol for that."
cvt76i,"NTA. If roomie wants to keep the cat, it's on them, not you, to pay for it."
cvt826,"Cancer is *not* synonymous with ""I'm mad that i died in a video game""

The use of the word is completely unnecessary and given the situation your brother is in, insensitive. There's other things you could say while gaming.

Your dad sucks for what he said to you, that's a horrible, horrible thing to blame you for. 

BUT knowing his brother died of cancer, you threw it back in his face and blamed *genetics*?? 

YTA, completely. 100%.

The fuck is wrong with you? I hope this is a shitpost, but if not, you're a kid who needs to understand the weight of your words."
cvt8wc,NTA. That’s social media etiquette 101.
cvt99y,You share the bedroom.....and the bed?
cvt9dp,"Prom isn't really relevant, but graduation isn't just about you. You should make an effort to go for your family."
cvtano,"NTA
change all the passwords to Netflix, Hulu, and the WiFi since he’s not paying for it. Then start taking his crap and using your half of the apartment 

Then when your lease is up gtfo. Not even worth it"
cvtcvq,"NTA. You don’t have to “report” to anybody when you’re going to sleep, or what you’ve been doing all day. LDR, or not, your gf is being way too controlling."
cvtjzz,YTA. It's a 4 person table being sat by 1. It's incredibly inconsiderate to not let others sit.
cvtmeo,YTA -  I think your money would be best spent on a therapist.
cvtnkq,YTA. You're gatekeeping. She is allowed to be uncomfortable with something and to tell you and have that be respected.
cvtrw9,"NTA. You are just describing your experience. He may lose some customers, and may gain some who are more in line with his lifestyle."
cvtsis,"NTA - You were sitting in an unreserved section and eventually gave them your seats anyway. That dude seemed unnecessarily rude and is therefore the AH. One thing you could have done when they came around the first time, is explicitly point out that you were in an unreserved section thus your seat could not have possibly been his seat; might have saved that guy some blood pressure."
cvtubo,"NTA.

From what you said you didn't insult your parents, you didn't retaliate against them, you just made it clear you're not putting up with this anymore and left.

You are an adult, not a child.  You are to be treated with respect.

I know family is important, but so are you."
cvtxrl,"NTA it's pretty hypocritical to suddenly gain religion, demand your roommate to change to not offend you, while simultaneously disrespecting their religion and identity. List the room on Craigslist and let her move out. Make her pay a months rent for breaking the lease."
cvtxwf,NTA. But dude his feelings of worthlessness aren't yours to fix. He's being super codependent here and you need to think about the boundaries you need with him if you're going to remain friends.
cvtyzy,"ESH, but her more than you. Our son takes meds that put him in the same boat as your daughter. Rule #1 is healthy foods such as produce can be eaten at any time, even if it's before dinner. Rule #2 is he gets a shake with whole milk, protein powder, and whatever goodies he wants in it, like ice cream, fruit, or Hershey's syrup, before bed. Rule #3 is to *never* use food as a punishment or reward. He's finally up to a healthy BMI after 6 months of doing this. This is literally your daughter's life and your wife has no business using food as a form of control. You shouldn't be name calling but I do get the fury that comes along with someone doing wrong by your child, especially when it's the other parent."
cvu0f9,"NTA. If anything, she should start paying more in rent as there is now another person living with her. You don’t need to cater to her needs. The title is a bit confusing btw

Edit: punctuation"
cvu1vz,"NTA 

>I love her because I have to

No, you don't have to."
cvu44t,"Your mom is a narcissist. She is abusing you. You need to get away from her as soon as possible, for your own sanity and well being. Can you stay with friends or family while you figure something out?"
cvudil,"NTA. If she wants more food, she can help cook."
cvufre,NTA. Cut them out. Talk to a counselor. Come back if and when you are ready. Cutting toxic family from my life was the best thing I did. It hurts a bit and there is some guilt but do it. Distance let's you see things a little clearer and focus on you.
cvugb9,"NTA. Your parents are catering more to your brother than you, and are being quite unfair. Just talk to them about it."
cvugh7,"NTA.  He's been doing this for years and you warned him you wouldn't tolerate it anymore.  He was hoping you'd just roll over and take it.  Clothes wrinkle in the dryer too so it doesn't make a difference if it's on the floor, you gotta hang it up right away.  He's just mad he can't be as lazy anymore."
cvuh0r,"NTA.  But honestly if I were you, I'd do nothing yet and CALL A LAWYER.  Im not an expert in law so I can't give details, but I feel like there's a lawsuit here for you to take.

COMPLETELY innappropriate behaviors from both bosses, definitly enough to get them fired.

Make sure you delete nothing from either of them.  Keep all logs of conversation."
cvuikt,NTA. As far as I’ve always been led to believe it is very rude to invite people to wedding related events leading up to the wedding when you have no intentions of inviting them to the wedding. This will inevitably look like you’re phishing for gifts .
cvulfc,"NTA

she has to be able to do things on her own

but a reminder that if she's an introvert virgin who has never been drunk what's most likely to happen is she's going to get hammered off 3 drinks, cry in the bathroom, and pass out at a friend's house with her shoes still on, no boys in sight."
cvuo8n,"I’m going to say NTA.
Not only is that kind of driving hazardous, it causes your family to have to spend money to make repairs (replace tires, brakes, etc) more often than should be necessary. Your parents should be grateful that you let them know what’s going on before something serious happens"
cvuofb,NTA. Tell her if she wants a house by June to go to the bank or a lender and start figuring out what she can afford.
cvurev,"ESH- her for obvious reasons and you for asking this question. Are you running a business or not? Are you her employee or is she yours? You need to set firm standards and hold people accountable. You should know what your business needs and what standards need to be met, what and how you can pay people and be profitable and not run into legal issues. If you have someone working for you that is a negative impact why are they even there?

Edit: Also mixing relationship issues, personal finances and business is a horrible idea."
cvurk2,"NTA

File a dispute with your credit card company, bank, or PayPal, include the screenshots if necessary. They basically admitted to not sending your item and regardless of their policy, you’re entitled to your money back on an item you didn’t receive. Best of luck."
cvusu9,NTA it’s not your problem to help someone else just because they want you to
cvux9t,"NTA. I think you are allowed to think what you want. But it’s also likely you’ll never really know.

I work in a field where I interact with people in many different situations with mental health, brain trauma, etc. It’s entirely possible he wasn’t responsible for his actions. It’s also possible that he was disabled *and* a dick. There’s no way to know."
cvv4h5,"“Made her turn it off”

So her moms controlling her and now you’re controlling her 

You will not win by making her choose between you or her parents. Sure her parents sound super awful but she is the one that needs to come to terms and make that decision. If she is financially dependent on them then she’s is going to listen to them.

If this doesn’t work for you then you can leave the relationship, but forcing her to turn off her phone apps is controlling and you’re no better 

YTA"
cvv812,"NTA, but watch out for these neighbors. It sounds like they need to learn how to mind their own business. When you buy a new house, it's expected that you may be getting some work done. You just met them and they're already complaining about petty things like workers parking in the street, that's not a good sign at all. They should be happy to have a new neighbor that keeps the house maintained and doesn't bother anyone."
cvv8nc,"ESH- shouting at the crowd isn’t the way to go, but you know it was a dick move to wave money under his nose and walk away. There’s no scenario where that looks good. 

Funny, but still a dick move."
cvv8qy,NTA Usually when it comes to other people's kids I'd say mind your own business but that's so cruel.
cvvb59,"NTA of she's vindictive like that, splitting the plan is the safest way"
cvvcg5,"Why don’t you take the time to teach them about hygiene instead and maybe gift them a little starter kit, they may not even know that hygiene is something they should even think about. 

NTA OP you sound like a great person for caring."
cvvcrq,NTA. Getting out of a lease in which the original terms were violated by threatening to expose said violations is not an asshole move. Misrepresenting the living situation was an asshole move by your roommates.
cvvfn9,"NTA

He definitely overreacted. He owes you an apology."
cvvged,"YTA- Even if she is lying, there was no reason to engage her on the topic. Also, you don't have to be thin to be in good shape, seriously you don't. I've known overweight people who run, who have climbed mountains, and who are incredibly physically strong. You really can't tell what a person can do by looking at them, and that assumption alone makes you TA."
cvvgjt,"YTA. It'd be one thing if your co-worker had expressed to you they were uncomfortable with it, but as of now all you have is a vague sense on your end that it's ""creepy."" For all you know, this level of interaction is all there is, or for that matter that however much interaction they have is very much welcomed by your co-worker. You don't know that there's any sort of problem, and given that, you need to treat it like any other relationship of your dad's and mind your own business."
cvvm84,"NTA. 

Keep it. She finished her inspection, and found nothing. Now she wants to complain? It’s too late."
cvvmot,"NTA. You told someone that you wouldn’t be able to go, it’s not your fault that your manager didn’t let the others know."
cvvnh5,"NTA- a lot of older cribs have been recalled over the years because we have learned more child safety.

Check the crib for stability, it could just be that a screw came loose in the move. Then check online reviews of the model. 

Tell them that you appreciate the gesture they made, but you have concerns that they are not up to code. 

If it does end up being safe, though, at least consider it. You won’t want to always lug a portable crib all the time. It would get old fast."
cvvnsy,NTA. Your sister crossed a line.
cvvnu6,"NAH. I totally get him wanting to keep an eye out for your safety. You're obviously feeling more violated than safe, and talking to him wouldn't be an asshole move at all. Sounds like a good time to talk about boundaries and growing up."
cvvo6x,"NTA. Your manager is is not only insulting you, he's apparently willing to put you in danger rather than do something about broken equipment. Your grievance was totally merited. Maybe he was just having a bad day or two, but that doesn't make what he did in any way okay. And I'm a little unclear about the timeline of events, but it's not necessarily the case that he realized on his own that he was in the wrong - entirely possible, for instance, that he found out about the grievance/the moped being deemed unsafe and is trying to cover his ass."
cvvotu,"NTA. And you would also be NTA for going up the chain of command and talking to her boss. 

Be specific that your boss let someone “hungover” (still drunk?) lifeguard and leave but wrote you up. However, your boss can fire you so beware that could be the outcome."
cvvox7,"NTA, just say 'Love you Mom, but I have plans for NYE.' It's not unreasonable to want to spend such a social holiday being social. One evening away in the grand scheme of a month, is not too much to ask for."
cvvpw4,"NTA. You offered her the lower rate because of her lower income; now she has a higher income, so it's perfectly reasonable to ask her to pay an equal share. She presumably equally lives in the apartment. She should have discussed this with you instead of letting you overhear her ranting to her mom."
cvvtzo,"NAH 

It's not a first date topic unless she said something about it or asks you.  Telling her within the first 3 months is perfectly fine."
cvvzbe,Non hugger here. I don’t appreciate hugs. Ask people before you hug them. YTA.

cvyf6r,"NTA: charging for tabs is something only the artist and their publisher are allowed to do. He is committing copyright infringement by creating and distributing such tabs as is anyone, but most record companies let it go as no money is being made on it. Him charging would definitely cause him to have an issue.  BIg tab sites like Ultimate-guitar get permission or pay rights fees to host the tabs, and some artists like Audio Slave don't allow it because they don't have a way to get paid for that.

Edit: just for clarity. Copyrights for music come in 2 forms. The music and lyrics of the song, and the actual recording.  if you want to recreate the music itself you have to get permission/pay a use fee to do so. This gives you the right to use music and lyrics in a limited way. If you want to use the recording itself, you must then pay a SECOND fee.

What we are talking about here is people all over the internet recreating and sharing how to play the music. While this would normally be frowned up, most tab sites pay the fees to the publishers/artists and receive permission to have said tabs on their site. They then have ad and memberships to pay for those fees. Some artists (Audio Slave is the biggest that comes to mind) do not allow their stuff to be put on Tab sites either because they want to sell tabs of songs themselves, or have no way of being compensated in their contract for this particular purpose.

What is happening in OP's case is that someone is asking to be paid to recreate the music of an artist without compensating the artist. They are not only committing copyright infringement, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but then they are profiting off another artist without compensation. This is wrong and illegal. Also, $15.99-$29.99 will get you an entire album's worth of tabs from an authorized book. $20 for a single song is just WAY too much

Edit 2: Apparently Audioslave is back Baby! Rage against the Machine, Metallica, and Testament also went down for a short time"

Two reasons.  

One, people don’t need a reason to not want to do something.  It’s perfectly fine to simply not want to do something for no reason. It’s also fine to want to do something for no reason.    I occasionally act like a robot around my wife for no reason. 

Two. “No” is a complete sentence. They don’t owe you an explanation. They don’t owe anyone an explanation. You offered a suggestion, they said no. That’s the end of it.    Asking why once would be reasonable. Curiosity is natural.   Once they refuse to explain, that is DEFINITELY the end of it."

cvywzw,"NTA - You told her a fact but, generally, as it’s a widely believed wives tale, I usually would just drop it and let them have it.

cvyzbv,"NTA, who parks on a fucking grass yard in an urban neighborhood? What a jerk."
cvz03x,"NTA and I seriously recommend that you don’t go back for long. In no way is raising her child or even babysitting her child your responsibility. She chose this as the next step in her life so don’t feel like you need to take on the burden so it isn’t too much for her. Also, if you aren’t comfortable taking care of a child (which is a perfectly reasonable feeling) it probably is it the best idea for you to be doing so.

It sounds like a very very toxic relationship. I wonder if your aunt took you in to help or if she did it for the money. I’m sorry she has treated you like that and the further you can distance yourself from the craziness the better."

It will only hurt you to stay friends with her, especially because she puts her toxic boyfriend first and devalues your friendship in favor of him. Their relationship is toxic and his influence is making her toxic to you. You are doing the right thing by blocking them. I feel like she is out of your reach until she kicks that guy to the curb for good. 

I hope she comes to her senses and apologizes someday, but right now she's acting immature and selfish, and you are NOT in a place where that behavior is tolerable.

3. If you’re asking for an Uber to get there, how are you getting to work everyday? From the employers eyes, you have unreliable transportation and may not be at work or on time every day. Transportation is your responsibility, not theirs.

cw3t0d,"YTA. Reading between the lines, I think you probably *are* being overly confrontational.

If every single person you have confronted and will confront in the future turns out to be 100% lying, then I will absolutely eat my words, apologise and say that you're totally justified.

But, I don't think you will be right 100% percent of the time. Especially about people's mental health. You've got your own experience; they've got theirs. Just leave it at that.

Like I say, if someone is outright lying about doing military service when they didn't, and you're sure about that, by all means call them a liar in front of everyone in the room. Absolutely.

But it's not always that black and white. Maybe someone just *sounds* like they're lying; maybe they're exaggerating a little bit (god knows why). Given how likely it is that someone is completely bullshitting about doing military service - I know it happens sometimes - but you seem to have run into quite a few of them. And it seems unlikely to me that all those people were lying about everything.

Even if they weren't, the point is that you can't be 100% sure anyway. Even with your experience. 

So, it sounds like you're looking for these people. It sounds like you've got a chip on your shoulder about it and probably enjoy the confrontation on some level. Which isn't a bad thing if you're accusing a liar of lying. But when it happens so often and your wife doesn't like it, at that point you'd start to wonder if maybe *you're* part of the problem. And also why do you hate these people so much and why do you keep finding them everywhere?

Just my reaction to the post. I could be wrong and off base."
cw3ws0,"NTA....but I have a couple of questions. 

Why does a stay at home dad need to send the child to daycare two days a week? Maybe I'm just old but I do not understand why a stay at home parent needs a daycare.

Why are you with someone who clearly doesn't care about you? If he cared, you wouldn't have to ask. I have a friend in a similar relationship. I don't get it. 

You have some issues right now with your foot (I'm sorry to hear that, I know it must hurt) but you aren't sick. You do not have some disease that makes you unable to work and though you are in pain, you still do everything you just do it more slowly. What happens when you get really sick? Oh, right....you had to take care of him after your C-section. 

Quit covering for him. When someone mentions massages....say, ""Yeah, that would be nice, but I have to cook dinner and do the laundry."""
cw3xde,"YTA. Your husband is right. It’s hypocritical to spend ~$2000 on buying him a new camera when you refuse to drop a couple hundred on your son’s Switch.

It sounds like you have this image of the perfect family on the perfect vacation, but your actually family doesn’t fit that image. Your husband is clearly uncomfortable with a lot of attention, so you had a huge group shower him with it. Your son doesn’t seem to be enjoying himself at all, so you rejected his request for something fun to do on your trip. And now you’re crying because they’re not reacting the way you think they should. Of course they’re not. You’re purposefully ignoring their wishes so *you* can have the “perfect” vacation.

You need to step back, think of the family you actually *have*, and figure out how to make this vacation perfect for *that* family instead of the one in your mind.

>I suggested that maybe we were being too soft with the kids

If children don't like you, the answer is not to be harsher with them. Your wife is correct, children and teens respond more when they have a good bond. If you don't want to go to therapy with the kids (I can see why, TBH), go alone and come up with a plan for how you will bond with them. This might mean making a daily point of giving genuine praise, taking a full weekend to do something they really want, trying out being the relaxed parent for a weekend or camping trip. This might be more effective than having an 11 and 8 year old sit. through therapy.

ETA: This is a legitimate technique used in managing children with behaviour issues in classrooms. When a child doesn't listen to you, making a point to develop a positive rapport is 10x more effective than increased punishment."
cw7p30,"NtA. Nothing wrong with a low key celebration. Like a cake, maybe candles, some cards. Birthday wish is pushing it a bit, that is more of a kid thing, but it's harmless. Don't these people know how to have fun?"
cw7ua6,"NTA. It is well within your rights to decide that you don't want that much chaos and unhealthy behaviors in your life. Some people never outgrow those stages and continue to behave in ways that just don't translate to successful adulting. Your friend sounds like one of these.

If they never acknowledged what they did, then are you to accept that they’ve changed? If they had apologized and you forgiven them, then it would be another story.

And one outburst about how horribly they treated you isn’t always bring up the past. It was bring it up one time and forcing them to look at the things they did. If they can’t face the things they did, then they shouldn’t have done them.

cw9bsy,"Yeah, that's kind of a dick move. You're on vacation with a family that's treating you. Even if you offered and thanked them, you're still on vacation with them. A discussion with how they felt about it before hand would probably have been ok if you were willing to accept whatever their answer was. But, it sounded like you basically told them they could stay with you if they wanted, but that you were staying either way. Which is kind of rude when you were there with your friend... it is a bit like ditching her for another friend, even if the fireworks was the real reason you wanted to stay. It comes off a bit selfish, I think an apology would be in order, and I'm surprised you didn't apologize already when you found out your friend was upset about it. Eve if you think she shouldn't feel the way she does about it, and I think their feelings were justified imo, it still wouldn't kill you to feel some compassion and apologize for hurting your friend's feelings by ditching her for another friend while she and her family took you on vacation with them. You were definitely the asshole, and it sounds like while your friend was upset... and gave you a bit of the silent treatment for a while... she was not an asshole at all."

cwabb7,"NTA and this sounds a little sketchy to me. He got her a job where he works, she moved across the country to be near him and he flipped his lid she can’t come over while you’re gone?"
cwabda,"NTA, and quite frankly your husband is a bit of TA for thinking this is even remotely okay. If he's anything short of supportive of you demanding basic respect in your home then it's probably time to have a serious conversation with him, too."
cwabs1,"This one has two different parts:

1. NAH on the issue of hyphenating. I get why it seems like a good compromise, but I also know it can be a real pain-in-the-ass.
2. YTA for basically saying ""I don't want any future kids or myself to take your name, even partially... because it's a *stupid name!*"" It is what it is. Not everyone gets to pick the last name they are born with."
cwadtq,"I agree with your judgment for the most part, but personally I think NTA because OP’s bf went off on her only two weeks after her ADD diagnosis which explains her forgetfulness. OP shows a huge willingness to take personal responsibility here and implement things that will help her overcome ADD symptoms that might get in the way of others, and I think it’s really not cool that her bf isn’t sympathetic in the slightest given the knowledge that this pattern of behavior is somewhat out of her control and she’s barely had time to even process that diagnosis. He also ranted AT her on behalf of someone else, which seems really inappropriate to me- he could have expressed this in a much kinder way without aggression or anger."
cwaerb,YTA- Can't blame a family for the actions of one member and secondly I would guess they feared an overreaction from you and probably would have waited for the right time to tell you. Blocking this family only gonna hurt you in the long run.

cwamea,"ESH. Your friend shouldn’t have booked the time of the shoot without your consent, regardless of her plans to get pregnant. That’s grade-A selfishness right there. I can also see her decision on the location as presumptuous, but I’m not as offended on your behalf about that.

For your share, a little anecdote first: my birthday is this weekend, and my best friend booked us an Airbnb in a different state. She’s paid for all the lodging, we’ll be taking her car, and she’ll pay for my birthday meal and drinks. That’s huge, yeah? But she also put some events on the itinerary that’ll be more meaningful for her than for me. And you know what? I’m so game for it. Why? Because she’s been so giving and considerate in every other way that, even though it’s my birthday, I owe it to her to let her revel in her own sacrifices too. I mean, she’s my best friend. We’re only going to grow even closer because of this trip, and it’s all thanks to her.

So no, I don’t think it’s asshole behavior at all to fork down a shit ton of money for your favorite photographer and want to make it a friends shoot. Your friend deserves a share in it too. You have every right to request an autumn shoot and a change of location, but the buck stops with your otherwise ungrateful attitude, and this is where you’re also TA. I’m seeing too much “What about me?” and not enough “Neat for me AND neat for us.” You’re not spending a dime, and even though it’s your birthday, some consideration for your friend is still due. Don’t be one of those birthday divas.

Aside from all this - Happy (late?) birthday, OP! 🎂"
cwanwj,"Dude. NTA at all. 

Most importantly, I need you to understand that you **do not** ever need to do any drugs that you don't want to do. Even though the cocaine was fake, you didn't know that. It could have been cut with something and you could have died. When you are older, if you want to experiment, then fine, do it when you know exactly what you have, but don't succumb to peer pressure. In this case, it can literally be life and death. 

Back to your original question, these people are horrible. Cut them out entirely. Don't associate with them. If they ask you, either ignore them, or tell it to their face. They are bad influences and terrible people. I'm sorry that you had to go through this."
cwanxk,"YTA, you want to cut her out because you don't want to explain the situation? It's not that hard to explain..

cwaxib,"So I want to say N A H because breakups are normal and rarely easy, but for me the part where YTA is #1, the part where you leave her dangling while actively developing feelings for and (let’s be honest) starting a relationship with another person. You may not have crossed the line into cheating while seeing GF (which is why you’re not T giant A), but you knew the relationship was over and you were laying the groundwork for the next one. That sucks. Your intentions were good, I think, but by holding back, you made things worse."

Now you want to put a stop to it because of a few dollars, despite the fact that she's performing so well in school that college is FREE.  Do not under any circumstances take that for granted - I'm in my mid-30's and I'm still paying for college.

Who knows where your daughter would be in the first place if not for her guitar lessons.  Perhaps if she didn't discover her passion for guitar, she might not have done well enough in school to earn her scholarship. YouTube is no substitute for an actual teacher."

cwbmty,NTA you saved the dog from horrible neglect! You did the right thing
cwbrsp,"YTA and you know it.  You can't just force a dog into someone else's household.  If you get a dog, he has every reason to walk out.  If you cry when you get to pet a dog, you need to be in therapy.  That isn't normal, it's a mismanagement of emotion on your part."
cwbsg6,NTA : They pulled out their phones first and started playing games without further engaging in conversation. Did they expect you to awkwardly sit there until the others came ? I can’t believe the chick even had something to say about it. Just because phones are more common in social settings doesn’t mean they’re acceptable and doesn’t count as rude if it’s pulled out during a meetup with friends.
cwbt1s,"NAH. This is a missed opportunity to do something good, rather than you failing to live up to a moral obligation."
cwbtw6,"YTA. Not because you're conceited, but because you're extremely wasteful. I can't even imagine how many toothbrushes and razors you've thrown out for basically no reason. Buy a metal razor and change the blades if you must and stop throwing out so much fucking plastic."
cwbu6t,"I...don't understand soo much of this.

If I'm right and these are your boyfriend's tenants rather than roommate and he's selling the house, then he needs to give them an eviction notice (or a formal declaration that he's not renewing the lease.) As for not wanting to be the asshole I don't get why that would be a problem.

Edit because I forgot: NTA I think. I'm not sure. This was so poorly written."
cwc1v5,"NTA. What you're asking for is for him to be healthy. As much as being flaccid sucks, I'd rather be with someone who was soft than someone who was psycho. Period.

cwcfqe,"YTA - for insisting HE call. You have the complaint, you should call."
cwcg6w,"NTA.  That is BIRTHDAY MONEY.  Birthday money is meant to be used on gifts.  I would tell all of your family members ""please do not give me money, my mom takes all of my money and never lets me have it.  I would heavily appreciate it if you could send me gifts instead so I can actually recieve something on my birthday and Christmas"".  Call her out.  Family members likely will fight her for you to give you your gifts from them.

I would never take my child's birthday money like this.  Money you make from work is another thing and is understandable to make you save.  Also to dictate that you never get to get anything ""cool"" is sad af.  That's essentially saying you don't get to have any childhood or any toys growing up.  That's sad."
cwck03,"NAH. I mean, this is how you make new friends in school, by knowing people who know other people and then getting to know them too. But if that's not something you want then fair enough. You don't have to sit with anyone you don't want to and its fine for her to ask about it.

I do however think that you will come off as a bit of an asshole to them in this situation."
cwcm7x,NTA.  That’s how the Catholic Church works.

cwedrg,"NAH. Sit down and figure out how much YOU are willing to spend on a wedding. You say you two will be contributing equally, so tell her how much you would be comfortable contributing and if she really won't budge then IMO she can contribute the extra money.

I understand that she wants her dream wedding, but you need to tell her seriously that you will not spend that much money."

cwefr4,NAH it sounds like she was joking or mostly in jest but it sounds like there’s a deeper context to your relationship that makes it better for you to set boundaries regarding this topic sooner rather than later
cwefs7,"YTA. It's your mom's house and she gets to decide what to do with each room. The fact that your brother is living there 12 months out of the year is a good reason to give him a larger room and more privacy. Pack your room as best you can in the time you do have, starting with the stuff you don't want her to see, and ask her to let you unpack the boxes if the concern is privacy.

When I started college, I came home one weekend and my parents had swapped my larger room with my high school aged sister's smaller one. Yeah, it sucked, and I was not amused by them moving my stuff without me there, but they had every right to make us swap. My only issue was that they had to go through my stuff without me.

There are kids who leave for college and are told they don't even have a room to come back to. Be glad that's not the case."
cweg70,"NAH. But you need to explore your issues with the situation. When will be a good time? It's not a space shuttle launch; it's moving in together. It's the next step in a relationship, and if you're never ready to take it you might not be right for each other. Even introverts recharge around their significant other when they are compatible. Or sometimes you find the right person it's just the wrong time. Maybe that's you. Maybe you're not ready because you're not at the same stage in your life. I don't know.

Also don't be surprised if she leaves you. It wouldn't make her an asshole either. She's ready and you're not. Four years is a long time to be together. Marriage wouldn't even be off the table. Long distance is a relationship killer so don't blame her if this goes south."
cweoxp,NTA - It's your wedding so your call. I find it to be reasonable especially since none of your family has even met her.
cweph7,Nta- helicopter parenting is weird and creepy imo. I had the luxury of growing up without a phone and just getting my ass whooped if I came home too late. Couldn't imagine being tracked like that
cweq7g,"ESH - your parents are doing a piss poor job of co-parenting you and keeping you out of their bullshit drama.

Now, if he has sex with someone on your desk or something, get back to me."
cweswi,NTA this happens all the time and it's not your fault. Could've easily been your roommate. The fact the paw was already hurt makes it completely not your fault. Our roommate is being a jerk. You're a saint for offering to pay half.

Apologize because you don't want a neighbour to despise you and potentially ruin your laundry because you clearly share a necessary resource? Yes. I don't like it but yes. Does she deserve it? Hell no.

> Should I have just waited for her to get her stuff?

No. You did the right thing. She was disrespectful to you by leaving her shit in there. What kind of self-absorbed person doesn't realize that other people might need to use the laundry machine so you can't treat it as if you own it (i.e., be lazy and leave everything in it).

I can understand her reaction *maybe* if you took it out after 5 minutes but... sounds like you waitied a reasonable amount of time."

And yes, I also agree that it would be more accurate for her to describe herself as ""half-Russian"". But Americans do have this weird thing about identifying with ancestral ethnicity."

cwgtan,"YTA. You have multiple people reaching out to you during a depressive phase. Do you have any idea how rare that is? 

In addition to your issues, you sound selfish. You're framing everything as how it relates to *you.* Did the coffee friend need to bend your ear? Did you ever think the other guy was reaching out to make a new friend? 

What a crappy way to behave.

**edit to add** mental illness is not a valid reason to treat people like shit."
cwgvuy,"NTA. He effectively stole your car. $86 ain't gonna rebuild that trust.

Edit:  read the other comments. This sub can be totally wack sometimes. He took HER CAR on a road trip to an unfamiliar place to do outdoorsy things, which can often involve driving places that can mess up your alignment or crack axles. What if he'd gotten into an accident or pulled over? It's not his fucking car, he should not put hundreds of miles on it while his girlfriend is out of town.

Also OP he should have been happy to drive you to the airport regardless - because, ya know, he's your boyfriend. Sounds like he did a ""good"" thing to butter you up before he STOLE YOUR CAR."
cwh2ir,"NTA- she made her own decisions. Also, does this sound like someone who should be working so closely with people? Maybe this will be the push she needs to work on herself."
cwh5m9,NTA. thieves can suck a dick
cwh7qg,"ESH?

Usually you round UP not down, but I mean dude, it's 65 cents. Why not talk to her about it or simply not lend her money anymore if it's *that* big of a deal?"
cwh8k9,"NTA - But your boss absolutely is. That feeling you got when he pulled you aside, the fear that he was about to fire you, doesn't belong in a relationship at all. Its not a fair power dynamic. Are you going to feel pressure to ""put out"" on your date b/c he might fire you? What if you have a spat, how will that affect work? This will also undermine any recognition you ever get b/c you're ""sleeping w/ the boss"". Get out ASAP."
cwh8x9,"NTA if your sister put in half the effort towards her child that you did with that spreadsheet, she'd be twice the parent she currently is."
cwhaoq,"NTA people need to understand that just because something is important to them, it doesn’t give them the right to demand that it is important to everyone else. If it was that important to her to talk about it, SHE should have steered the conversation in that direction.

Unfortunately only time will help her understand that she is making a big deal over this."
cwhbb1,"A DECADE later? 

Jesus your sister and brother need to get the fuck over themselves. NTA. Your brother in law was super presumptuous to even *suggest* he give the eulogy for your dad. What a clueless asshole. *Maybe* you shouldn’t have blown up on him, but it was a very emotional moment for you, his suggestion was completely inappropriate, *and you already sincerely apologized to him.* 

It appears to me like your siblings are just looking for something to be mad about, and it’s ridiculous because the only people who have any grounds to be mad are you and BIL and you’ve both let it go."
cwhcgi,"NAH. 

This is probably quite uncomfortable for your friend. Yes, you should have asked her to leave, but there's nothing that can be done about it now.

If you want to fix the tension between you two, I would suggest calling her or seeing her in person and explaining that the cat wasn't yours and you were just ending it's suffering. There was nothing that could've been done. 

As for your new kitten, what's the problem there? People grieve in different ways, and sometimes a new companion to distract you from the loss of an old one is what you need. I don't see what your friends issue with the new cat could be."
cwhche,"I don't see any other comments addressing this so I will.

why do you pay rent?? you're 16! you're not even a legal adult yet (assuming you are in the US). And I'm assuming you still go to school. What kind of parent expects their 16 year old child to pay rent?

Of course youre NTA. of course."
cwhe5k,"NTA

Plans were made, he's trying to change them, and it's disadvantageous to you."
cwhjnu,"She probably already knows what you're trying to tell her she just isn't ready to hear it. Let her live how she wants

Super soft YTA"
cwhpiy,"YTA. She could have had a variety of reasons to not want to go hiking with you alone. Maybe she was more comfortable staying with the group, but you didn't think twice because you sound like a narcissistic impatient prick. Grow up."
cwhr3p,"Wow... NTA. Id let your boss know they are abusing the place and make it miserable for you. Plus the stealing and rude behavior. 

Not ok. Sorry"
cwhra9,"NTA.  


Why the fuck did you tip him?"
cwi0v0,"YTA. You say you just wanted comfort and company, but it doesn't sound like you explicitly said that to him. Were you expecting him to read your mind? All you asked for was a ride home, and then food. It doesn't sound like you clearly expressed what you REALLY wanted, which is probably why you didn't get it from him."
cwi3bk,"ESH 

Your roommate sucks for telling you he is going to be fine, then moving in with you just to entirely turn around his opinion and nagging you every night about your behaviour. He shouldn't have made you this offer in first place. 

You suck because your night gaming hobby would annoying to any person. If you already live with someone on such a small space in one room you need to be even more disciplined about making it work. While I see that you take some efforts, the main problem is simply that your night hobby sucks for anyone that wants to sleep. 

IMO: Either you stop playing at night or you need to change your living situation"
cwi3gn,"NTA. You already have a job. You don't need more ""practice"" for the job that you're already doing. If they want your free labor, then they can give you free food...if you're willing to do an exchange. If not, just keep saying no."
cwieni,"YTA for not thinking it through before asking someone to leave her country. Now that it's hard, you want to throw her back...."
cwigyr,"NAH. I honestly can't see anything wrong with this situation. Unless, of course, you were keeping it to spite your uncle, in which case, deeefffinatlyy you"
cwiiz5,NTA. This counts as a couple's tattoo which is an odd thing to get without consulting your partner
cwijfo,"YTA - It's to share.

By your logic, she's got the window and a wall next to her penning her in, whereas with the aisle, you have a bit more breathing room on your other side. I prefer the aisle for this very reason.

Swings and roundabouts my friend. Share the armrest. If you both have to be petty about it, share it by time instead  (you get 30 mins, I get 30 mins) or whatever."
cwim6q,"NTA,

**You're** hosting, **you're** cooking, therefore it's **your** choice what is prepared."
cwio3r,"YTA 

“My story doesn’t begin here” . Ego much? Sorry to break it to you mate, but that is where your story begins.  

If you don’t want to date those girls, fine. But to do it cuz of where they live (or most precisely , where YOU live) is a total asshole move."

cwisb7,I don't think you're an asshole. But the person who she's going to call now to talk about her shit stains et cetera probably thinks you're an asshole.
cwj7rq,"NTA.  That's just the truth.  Please make sure you're not financially exposed to these mean irrational people, and that Jane is safe.  

You were a good child to help your mother when she needed you."
cwja1i,YTA.  Grow up.  You are an adult now.  Act like it.
cwjg2a,"If you don't discuss it first YWBTA.

And I say this because of one statement that is presumptuous as hell:

""Surely they can just roll over and go back to sleep. "" 

Are you them? Do you know that some people can't *just* get back to sleep? Takes me 30-45 minutes to get back to sleep,  no matter what wakes me up, or what time it is.  I'd be goddamn furious about someone being that inconsiderate because they couldn't use their words like an adult and ASK FIRST! 

My kitchen shares a wall with the neighbors bedroom,  they work nights,  I use ANY loud appliances in the bathroom,  which is on the other side of the apartment."
cwjjcv,"NTA.  This is a third wheel kind of situation.  As nice as you are, there are times where you may want to do things just the two of you.  That's normal."
cwjrfc,"NTA - she gets paid to rent your room? Also you need to put your foot down with your credit card being used, cause ultimately you are the one that will be screwed over since the card is in your name. EDIT: I now re-read and noticed it's your dad's account, then yes, not your problem."
cwk4ku,"Nta. You gave her enough time. She didn't buy the dress and thats on her. And tattoos aren't cheap, so she wouldn't have been in that of a bad place moneywise."
cwk5x3,ESH - I’m getting exhausted reading all of these married couples who keep finances separate and then are pikachu face shocked when money becomes an issue. If you’re gonna get married learn to handle money as a couple.
cwk617,NTA your friend shouldn‘t judge your gf like that. He‘s TA here. She‘s already eating disordered and doesn‘t need people who tell her that. Maybe you shouldn‘t have told your gf but it bothered you so I wouldn‘t be mad.
cwk6bx,[deleted]
cwkalr,"NTA. I’d be inclined to not attend, but to make time to go and spend with your Aunt afterwards. She’ll appreciate the gesture and you can talk about your Uncle without any of the other distractions."
cwkbb0,All i can think of is the water bill!
cwkcsv,"NTA, particularly because they work in a school! They are going to have even more chance than anyone to be exposed to the pertussis. I’m a HS teacher and I stay on top of my vaccinations and boosters for this reason."
cwkctd,"You dad want have sex. NTA


 Heea tunneling hard and if no one stops this it'll only get worse, your mom seems complacent and he's trying to get in too deep. Let it run its course then garnish with a ""well how about that"" for a spicy finish."
cwkdji,NAH but you should probably just bite the bullet and pay half of the hair cut since you're stuck on a trip with this guy. Otherwise it might get unpleasant between you two. Plus men's hair cuts are cheap so maybe you're out 10 or 20 dollars/euros/whatever currency for half.
cwkekv,YTA for outing your sister like that. Nothing else to it
cwker2,"NTA Obviously. Don’t even feel guilty about it. As for the money, she got away easily. It’s a lesson learned for you. She was never a friend if she treated you this way so don’t cry over her, you did yourself a favor by cutting her out."
cwkf4a,"Definitely NTA but I was considering NoAssholesHere too, because her feelings mights be more complicated than simple embarrassment. She grew up with this sister who probably had to recieve more attention than her all her life, they are probably known as The Family With The Down Kid, it's entirely possible that she feels she never recieved enough attention and is tired of being defined as The Sister Of The Down Kid, and just wants to be herself alone for once. That's entirely speculation though and she could simply be an asshole, too. I don't know their situation so I'm not gonna judge her but you are 100% NOT the asshole."
cwkkq3,"NTA

You told her the truth. But you could have handled that WAY better by saying you are still using the old until they are done so you can keep their gift longer."
cwksas,NTA your friends are stupid and they should pay more attention if they're gonna bitch
cwkv58,"NTA

I'm a firm believer that we get to choose our family. If your mother is not respectful of the love of your life, she has no place in yours."
cwkyri,"NAH

She asked you a favour that you couldn't provide for a very good reason. She probably started crying because she is under pressure, but I don't see you making a mistake, because you didn't withhold help for punishing her or another bad intention."
cwkzkg,"I would say NTA but you are going to cause problems and put more strain on your relationship with your ex husband. Try to get more tickets, make everyone feel included."
cwl0r2,"NAH

If you're not feeling up to it you're not obligated to do anything. I don't think shutting yourself in will make you feel any better, but at the end of the day you're an adult and if your mental health is making you want to be alone you have that right."
cwl3fy,"NTA, I guess? But y’all are dramatic af. I highly doubt EVERY time you go see a movie this happens."
cwl4e3,"Nta, he sounds like a walking liability time bomb. Have your dad start the formal eviction process."
cwl9xh,NTA. Take their shit out of the washer or dryer and throw it on the floor or in a hamper in the basement until he wants to deal with it. You’re not their fucking parent!
cwlbog,"NTA. Tell them ASAP. You like the store, they like you. He is jeopardizing their business."
cwlbwe,NTA. Invites are valid for the invited people. Adding extras *without even asking* is plain rude.
cwlcwp,"NTA. It's a shitty situation,  but you were upfront about the move in date. Be firm with her because if she walks on you now, she will continue to do it in the future. Especially make sure she knows those parties aren't okay if you don't want them in your home."
cwlkmt,NTA you're doing the right thing
cwlkwp,"YTA. But not for the incomplete question in the title.

The interaction would have ended with you just disconnecting and telling your dad he was being a prick. I work IT. It's as easy as hanging up, I promise. 

But now, anyone that knows his experience with computers probably also knows about his attitude problem, it's not going to be hard to piece together who changed his background.

Continuing to deny it if you get confronted further will just make you seem like even more of a petulant child."
cwln90,"YTA for expecting it when it wasn't discussed ahead of time. Of course you're correct that it would've been good of him to do this, but he's under no obligation to do so for a PT employee, unfortunately. 

Have you talked to him? I know you said he's a tightwad, but often very affluent people are just waaaaay out of touch with the lives most people lead and he may have no real conception of what that check meant for your personal finances.

Edit to add that depending on the size of the firm/# of other PT employees, he may be concerned about setting a potentially expensive precedent by paying you for this out-of-office time."
cwlvpu,"If you are a follower of a particular faith, it is for **you** to check that the food that you are eating is halal or haram (as is the case here). The fact that it happened is not on your head. 

Now, turning to the question of whether you should tell them... Honestly, I don't know whether you should or you shouldn't. And for that reason, I am going to say that whichever choice you make - to tell or not to tell - you're NTA. It was never your responsibility to police their food choices on their behalf. 

I'd personally stay quiet."
cwlw8v,"NAH

I hate pictures of me being posted online, so I get your point of view.  As a dad though, I understand him wanting to show off the time he got to spend with his family.  

Since he removed it, I'd say no harm no foul."
cwlxv7,NTA I think he is asking a lot for you to take on the extra responsibilities of his cats and then telling you he will he homeless if you don’t take them.  He is giving you an ultimatum and that is unfair.  Realistically if he cannot care for them he should take them to a shelter.
cwlzhj,NTA - in my gym most people would just have given up on wiping down the machine at that point so the fact that you actually still did it makes you better than most...
cwlzon,"YTA. People change their minds, and this is between your sister, your mother, and your father. Your input is entirely unnecessary"
cwmcem,YWBTA. Just talk to her. Cry at her if thats what it takes. Passive aggressive won't solve it and will probably get you shrugged off as a moody teen.
cwmgjv,"NTA. You already talked about it. You sound very logical. She made the choice without you, she should deal with that choice."
cwmhl5,"YTA absolutely, how much notice did you give him before taking children over to his apartment? He was doing you a favour and you couldn't be responsible whilst in his apartment to watch the children you were supposed to be supervising. 


It's not unreasonable for him to ask you for damages, these renters were coming for 3 months with 3 months worth of luggage, they wouldn't want to be shuffled between a hotel and their long term stay so I see why they cancelled."
cwmjpu,NTA it was an innocent joke... You decided nothing for your child
cwml4u,NAH. Just ask if he could repeat his opinion next time.
cwmlec,"NAH.

They are not assholes for telling you your performance is subpar (I mean, they are discussing it with you, maybe not in the best way but considering you are highschoolers that's normal).

You are not the asshole for quitting on the spot, the rest of the team want to be more competitive and you want something more relaxed to have fun, I understand it. It was maybe a bit childish if you did it as a tantrum, but even in that case is not an asshole move, since they have a replacement already if I understood you correctly."
cwmlq3,"NAH.

At least if you do it properly. That means: first approach their parents and talk to them, maybe she doesn't know she's adopted and they prefer to keep it that way (in that case, I would say you should respect that), or maybe they don't want her to know anything about his father for whatever reason...

If they allow it, however, go for it. But that's important, first meet them and ask them."
cwmo75,"NAH IMO in regards to sharing the pic since it is public. Assumption being that had she not wanted it out there for just anyone to see, her account would be private. I'm not sure what was said about her pic though so even though I don't think any of you are ah about the sharing, the comments that followed could potentially change my mind."
cwmr80,"YTA. You filming a mental breakdown is seriously fucked up.

If you have issues with her (because she sounds awful) go to HR."
cwmrle,"NTA - the other guy here is the victim of the good ol' saying ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes."" He could have picked a window seat or an aisle seat, but instead gambled and found himself sandwiched between two people. Sucks for him, that's the seat he booked."
cwmss7,NTA - just tell them you'll send the ones worthy of sharing.
cwmsvq,"A group decided to give you the ban, imo the group you live with would also have to agree to the ban. If the group chose not to support it when you were banned and it was just the individual forcing the ban, that would be like you banning them on your own without the support of the others you live with.  
IMO"
cwmtp1,YTA if you think volunteering with old people for 2 days is worthy of putting on a resume.
cwmxg4,"ESH to a degree.  Your parents are enabling horrific behavior on your brother's end.  He and his girl are clearly not fit to be parents, and the kids are caught in the middle.

Call CPS and get them removed, at very least."
cwmz4z,"NTA.

Extroverts never understand introverts.  Don't expect them to.

Take the ""me time"" your partner told you to (***kudos*** on finding a truly excellent and understanding woman!!) and don't stress on the fact that you *need* time away from everyone else.

Make sure your partner knows how much you appreciate her understanding when you get home! ;-)"
cwn2q8,"NTA. He was hedging. If you’d shown interest, he would have been delighted. When you clarified, his ego got hurt and he made it seem like you were overreacting. A tale as old as time."
cwn74y,"YTA if you confront him. 

You accept that it was your own fault that you found yourself in this situation and while he could have hurried back to help you, he didn't really have to. He may not have class but he was eating, why should he have to abandon a meal he paid for just to go rescue your dumb ass? 

Learn from your mistake, laugh it off and move on. No point starting an argument over it, there is nothing to be gained from that other than a potentially frostier relationship with someone you have to continue to live with."
cwn83a,"Your statement ""whenever she was available to do so would be fine"" left the door wide open for her to be ""available"" tomorrow.  YWBTA if you told her to take the dog today."
cwn8xh,"YTA, that's really gross. Your feet are probably still covered in bacteria from stepping around in a hot moist shower and walking over the bathroom floor which probably has molecules of fecal matter. Fecal matter that's been going on her face for months. 

Please apologize to her profusely and get your own soft towel."
cwnab0,YTA- it had nothing to do with her service and was obviously up to the establishments dress code. Just because you didn't find it aesthetically pleasing doesn't mean you should reduce someone's pay.
cwnall,"NTA

If they agree to watch your kid, they agree to take on the responsibility of your kid. 

If this ornament was import or valuable to them...maybe don't give it to a toddler to play with."
cwnemy,YTA Alexa is the best daughter my mom has
cwnex1,"NAH, but be prepared for all the issues this will entail. You and your child will be fielding questions and getting hot takes for a lifetime."
cwnfq3,NTA But can you give me that guy’s phone number?
cwnimk,"NTA - After you refused once, she should've dropped it. Nobody is obligated to give up their free time to help a coworker in a bind."
cwnl81,"NTA, for them to act offended that you didn't cave into their demands to not be gay is rude and unnecessarily controlling of them. It's your life to live, they can explain to their kids one day that the reason they stopped seeing their aunt is because they couldn't accept her for who she is and not what they wanted her to be.

Congratulations by the way. Don't let this dishearten you but stand your ground, end of the day it's their loss they imposed on themselves."
cwnllg,"NTA - What kind of manager thinks that that’s ok to do when showing a new colleague around? In future, I would refrain from guessing anyone’s age though, I never do it because so many people get offended if your guess correctly or older 🙄"
cwnnex,NTA and please do something to get help for the baby.
cwnpvq,"Nta, everyone's just oversensitive."
cwnu1t,"NTA. There's no problem in asking, specially if you do it nicely. Just explain them the situation and that you rather stay further away from the TV. If it doesn't work buy earplugs and hope for the best. Good luck!"
cwnudp,"NAH, if you really didn't recognize the person after surgery.  That is completely different than not accepting the person."
cwnugz,NTA because she explicitly said you could have it.
cwnwno,I live in a high rise and have a Ring doorbell. Mine is set to only record once someone rings the doorbell. I changed the setting because my phone would alert every time someone walked by. It’s not unlikely there’s is setup the same way.
cwnyz8,"NTA. You did absolutely nothing wrong. 

Her reaction is probably just embarrassment: from her perspective, she'd been had like a kid whose vegetables were cunningly disguised as something else by their parents because in reality the kids don't actually dislike the taste, it's just in their head (except in this case you didn't actually do any intentional disguising)."
cwnzcl,"YTA. If I’m reading this right, you asked, “Are you sure?” By nodding she was saying, yes I’m sure. If that’s the case then YTA. She expressed twice that she was uncomfortable with the gesture but you did it anyway for the sake of kindness."
cwo2ma,"NTA

Your wedding. You do it however and invite whoever you want."
cwo59p,"NTA. This is absolutely bizarre of him to invite you, especially given the divorce was due to his infidelity. Why would you want to celebrate his new marriage? Why would his new fiancee want you there? Does she even know you're invited?

Definitely don't go. If he's mad about it, that's on him. He sounds like a major asshole, and you don't need to keep trying so hard to be friends with him."
cwo7a4,"NTA. What I'd suggest is similar to another thread on her a week or so ago. Take them both for their walk around the block, drop one off and continue for your run. Alternate days. That way they're both getting time together on a walk and it's less OMG ONE DOG IS OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT ME.  


Or, get your partner to take up running too. They can take the other dog. ;)"
cwo89a,"NTA.

My standard is if you can help without undue burden to yourself or others, you should help. And undue burden is and should be flexible per person and per situation, within reason. 

In this case, you were unsure of your ability and had past experience failing to do this successfully, deciding to refer her to someone with steady hands, same as a doctor out of their depth. You still looked carefully, evaluated the situation, and were willing to help if you could. This is an easy rating.

Your mother should not have been pissed off."
cwo8lq,NTA. I was homeschooled and it takes a very structured disciplined person to homeschool a child. Let alone a special needs child. I had that structured disciplined person to homeschool me. Unless your sister gets special training and gets a schedule for schooling that she follows I feel she shouldn't homeschool.
cwoapq,"NTA.  Guessing you're a woman?  Men telling women to smile (or implying they should and if they're not, something is wrong) is a form of low key sexism.  As long as you're being professional and not rude, there is no reason you need to smile to do your job and he needs to get over it."
cwodto,YTA. He is old enough to decide what he wants to do with his body and having his ears pierced is harming nobody.
cwoj1f,"I'm gonna go against the grain and say NTA, personally I dislike when people do stuff like that. To the people saying ""aren't med school students supposed to be busy?"" Well yeah so why waste your time trying to do dumb stuff just to show off when you can have it handled. She was just trying to make it seem like she was better. Good on you for reporting it OP"
cwoptt,"NAH. Trust, your employer would terminate you asap if a better situation came along."
cworjo,"NTA - People grow up and it happens. Your interests change, your lives take different directions... 

You're under no obligation for anyone else's happiness but your own. Sounds like R only wants to be friends when it's convenient for her."
cwot9u,"Info:  Why is this all about you?  It's not your wedding, and not your adoption.  Perhaps it's time for self-reflection."
cwotsj,"YTA for this:

> AITA for expecting him to do what I want him to do, when I want him to  do it 

Jeepers.  Are you guys invested in some 24/7 slave relationship?  That is the only way I can understand saying that and not wondering ""perhaps it is I who am the problem""."
cwotu6,"ESH (except the brother).  Has anyone actually asked your brother what he wants to do?  It's his future, not yours.  If you think he should be tested, get him tested.  Your parents are assholes for coddling him and insulating him and thinking that everything is fine, but you also don't get to just magically swoop in and judge the merits of their plan.  It sounds like you're trying to advocate for him, but you're not actually advocating for him."
cwouro,"NTA, but the system is bullshit.   
Automatic zero? That's a load of boiling garbage."
cwov34,"NTA. Giving something to charity is not the same as throwing them away. She made the decision on your behalf that she deserves those clothes more than whoever was to receive them from the charity.

If you choose to confront her, frame the discussion around the fact that she did not ask you if it was okay for her to take your things. Don't die on this hill - I would let her keep the clothes. But I would also insist that she crossed a boundary and put my foot down that she cannot help herself to your things at any point in the future."
cwoyc2,"NTA. I don't believe you were the one who put her through all of that, your adviser is. If your adviser was going to the conference then why wouldn't he be the one to present it? It would have avoided a whole headache for your lab-mate. He is the asshole here."
cwoz23,"YTA.  If your food needed extra time, you should have stayed in the kitchen to take care of it.  How was the the other person supposed to know it was yours and you were coming right over?  They didn't know you were across the hallway.  For all they knew, that food was going to sit in the microwave for 10 minutes.  Are they supposed to put their lunches on hold indefinitely while they wait for some mystery person to get around to coming back?"
cwozq6,"YTA

You shouldn't expect anything, it's his money to do with as he chooses, you are an adult, if you want it then work for it and get it yourself instead of expecting a handout."
cwp0g9,YTA - horrible for the environment and there are people who could have used it.
cwp2vy,"NTA. They’re *way* late, and you really don’t need the extra stress with a newborn child."
cwp7p3,"NTA

While I understand that he's got a complex about it, he's had over a decade to deal with it and it doesn't seem to have affected his life in the slightest. At a certain point you need to get over yourself and face reality."
cwp88n,"> We are kind of tired of trying to appease everyone in our lives.

YOU DID IT CHARLIE!!! YOU DID IT!!!

You have discovered the hidden purpose of the wedding ritual!!!

As you move on in your life with your partner, you must change your priorities. Friends, family must all take backseat to the union of you and yours. 

NAH. The system works. Enjoy your wedding. Send me cake."
cwpb23,"NTA

Hello fellow south Floridian. This is pretty clear cut. You are evacuating, which is the safe thing to do. The girlfriend is fully capable of evacuating herself - and can even do so with her pets - but is choosing not to. At that point, you have no obligation to put yourself in danger for her sake. Her personality is completely immaterial to the question.

This would be a less clear cut issue if the other party could not evacuate or could not make rational decisions in their own self interest, but that's not the case here."
cwpdc9,"YTA. Multiple other people said that they didn't want to watch anything too scary. You put on something that you didn't think is that scary, but **you wanted her to get scared just so that you could cop a feel.** You're a dick for putting on something scary and manipulating them. They reacted as to be expected."

Do NOT let her move in. She is flat out telling you this won't be temporary. It's going to be a hard talk, but you need to give her a flat out NO!"

cwpk2v,"NTA... that sounds like a total shock/omg reaction, not like you just wilfully yelled at the kid.  It sounds like it sucked for him too! But his parents sound like assholes."
cwpkak,"ESH 

> because they are so judgmental. They are the type of people that think they are better than other people and and spend tons of money on material items. My sister has become more and more like them, judgmental and materialistic,

Anyone who types drivel like this is equally judgemental."
cwplyt,NAH - go have fun camping.
cwpn5p,"NTA - Anytime your dad asks you for a favor for the rest of your damn life, you are officially allowed to respond with ""nah its too early""

cwpqqv,"In my opinion, NAH. No questions asked, that must have been hilarious."
cwpxc2,"NAH It’s reasonable for you to not want to run the risk on blowing a bunch of money so that someone can either cancel on you or to have a birthday trip with 2 people that hate eachother, but it’s also reasonable for them to be upset (I mean they might be in the process of a breakup)."
cwpxvo,"NTA. Libraries are meant to be quiet places, you aren't an asshole for getting someone kicked out for not following the rules(no matter the location).

 I lost a ton of nerves while trying to study/work on something in the library with people being loud."
cwq2b7,if you're unable to understand how this looks to your current partner then no amount of judging on this sub is going to help you
cwq3gk,"YTA - I am of the view that if you stand by and nod along, you are agreeing with the commenter. So yes, I can understand why your wife is pissed off at you. I would be furious if I was her."
cwq4rh,"You're def overthinking this.  NAH.  Bring him a cake if you want to.  But I'd say that you either bring an individual size cake, or bring one big enough for everybody.  Don't bring one that would only give enough for a few people.  You'd be unintentionally backing him into a corner of having to pick and choose people at that time.  If he wants to have that fight, let him do it.  But don't force it onto him."
cwq6rh,[deleted]
cwq7gy,"No, you aren't an asshole for not enabling/catering to an abuser.

Edit: Added very important word."
cwqdzc,"YTA.  That was a horrible thing to say, and I am pro choice.  Regardless of her political views, a decision like that is a very personal one.  If she had asked you what you would think about her pursuing abortion and  you responded, that would have been different.  Instead you took it upon yourself to suggest she wouldn't be able to be a good parent to her unborn child because of her situation.  That is offensive on so many levels.  Some thoughts should remain just that and not be verbalized."
cwqoyd,NTA.  Your worker sounds like a real asshole.  Keep doing what you can do and explain to your super where it goes sideways when shot stacks up.
cwqr6q,"Absolutely NTA kids are pretty perceptive, more than adults think. And if that's what you believe, cut off contact. She brushed off your issues, blamed her own wrongdoing on you and refuses to admit any mistakes on her part. You'd have a pretty high tolerance if you actually stayed in contact with her."
cwqsxz,"NAH while the your dad suggestion may have been not very good, he was doing it to look after you, and you have the right to rebuttal his point"
cwqu3l,"NAH, but bring it up gently and don't make her think it's because you don't like to see her naked"
cwqujr,"YTA

Weddings are expensive. She went out of her way to be accommodating for you and you rsvp'd him.  There isn't even a good reason you're trying to cancel."
cwqxdx,"ESH if you don’t like it, it doesn’t make it okay for you to do it back just because “they did it first.” Honestly, I don’t even have to tell my 6 year old this."
cwqy5r,"YTA for turning around and ignoring her when she tried to ask what you mean. 

It sounds like a misunderstanding  up to that point. You meant, ""there are fewer women in this club because it reflects the demographics of our major."" It sounds like she heard, ""of course there are fewer women because this is engineering where women don't belong."" 

I'm a lady engineer, so I've lived this experience. You personally may not believe that women don't belong, but I promise you that she has encountered more than one person who does believe that. It's demoralizing and exhausting to feel like you have to justify your existence in a class/club/major/career. It sucks that she jumped to that conclusion about what you said, but you didn't help when you dismissed her out of hand immediately after. 

I lean towards ESH if she was rude and ""demanding"" about an apology, but either way, YTA."
cwqzuz,"NTA- is this friend an adult? Cuz damn he sound like an 8 years old kid. He clearly does not understand boundaries or takes no for an answer. You explain nicely and he doesn’t understand, so u should definitely put ur foot down cuz u dont need to put up w that."
cwr0j3,Just throw them out. Christ.
cwr12z,"NTA- From my point of view it looks like she is hiding something. Nobody would lie about something this serious if they had nothing to hide. Like you said you tell her whenever someone hits on you, so maybe just have a conversation with her about this. In a relationship communication is key."
cwr1xz,"NTA. Appropriate response IMO, especially as if (like me) people wear non padded bras the nips are still visible. It’s not like you’re walking around shirtless."
cwr3hm,"ESH.  The solution isn't to tell your husband where to poop.  The solution is to make him clean his favorite bathroom and to invest in that spray called ""poopori"" or whatever so it doesn't reek (much better than just air freshener.)"
cwr4za,NTA lots of folks wear headphones to work out as well as for sensory issues. Sounds like a misunderstanding.
cwr5lb,"This isn’t an asshole scenario, this is an abusive marriage scenario. I think there are better suited subs for this."
cwr7q6,"NTA. You didn't just blow up at a single comment, this has been going on for a year - it's been a long time coming. And I mean seriously, shaming you DURING SEX ? I don't blame you at all for finally losing it. That said, I wouldn't bother getting angry with her any more - she's obviously not concerned with your feelings. I'm not usually one to go for the ""red flag"" speech, but if I were you I'd be seriously questioning my commitment to someone who treats me like that."
cwr9ht,"NTA obviously 

They can ask you to come in, but you don’t HAVE to. You’re allowed to say no. If you want the extra hours you can go, otherwise enjoy your day off."
cwrcor,"NTA  He has had two years to save up enough money to get settled in Canada.  It's great he wants to ""live his dream"" but not when it's on someone else's dime.  If he wants to travel around then he can save the money to do it."
cwrd16,"NAH, but it might mean the end of your relationship. This trip sounds important to you and I don’t think it’s wrong of you to want to go alone (solo travel and travel with a partner are very different experiences), but I don’t blame her for being upset about it either. Personally, I would be hurt by not being included in such a big life plan."
cwrib9,"NTA

BUT, it sucks that a 7 year old is caught in the middle."
cwrt7e,YTA. Sometimes we just do things to make our family members happy. Suck it up and celebrate with them. It will make them happier than you know.
cwruf5,NTA - Everyone has a breaking point. Being constantly put down isn't good for your mental health.
cwrus2,NTA and he sounds rather controlling if he’s trying to tell you want you can and can’t drink.
cwrvgj,"NTA - I think you did the right thing by being quiet, for the two reasons you stated."
cwrwu7,"You dropped it, it's your fault. YTA"
cws1qi,"NTA. But stop giving reasons at all. “I’m sorry, I already have a commitment.”"
cws2oe,NTA. No one should get a pet unless they are 100% committed to their care.
cws3i0,"NTA

I have done this before.  The only benefit of staying is if you want to use anyone there in management as a future reference for another job or if you ever plan on working there again."
cws3py,"YTA - His reaction seems out of left field (Possible ESH) but he may have responded that way because of how you asked. He is upset mostly because, in his eyes, you basically said ""I don't trust you"".

&#x200B;

And ultimately well... you did. You projected your friend's experiences on him, when he has done nothing, and that was probably very hurtful to him. That de-values your relationship.

&#x200B;

Also keep in mind faithful/loyal people, who don't cheat, also say ""I would never cheat""."
cws4iz,NTA. He sounds like a bludger
cwsghz,NTA - they were on a break
cwsgyj,NTA.  How old are you two brainless horseshoes?
cwsp41,NAH just tell them you don’t want the friend to go. You should be comfortable too! I think it’s normal not to want to spend a vacation with a virtual stranger for many reasons.
cwspg1,"NTA, i don’t think anyone in a relationship should kiss another person unless the other person is a really good friend and that’s only like a peck on the cheek"
cwsr7x,"NTA, but let the neighbors know. I'm sure they'd be happy their dog is getting more attention/exercise than planned"
cwstdo,"How about you watch your fuckin' mouth, you little shit."
cwsttl,"Oh my god NTA.

This sounds like a nightmare for you. It's not right, it's not fair, and they should *not* be using you as pawns like this.

Not only are you right to not talk to them, but I think you should go further and say you will block them if they ever send you a message that trashes the other again. They need to work out their anger towards each other in a way that leaves you the hell out of it.

I'm so sorry for this awful situation."
cwsusl,"NTA. Op, I think you have a legitimate issue here. You haven't traveled in a decade and I think your friend should be able to understand this. If you force yourself to go, it could go either way—you might surprise yourself and have a blast, or have a completely expensive miserable time. Since your anxiety is already this high before actually leaving, it just seems like too much to go through on your own."
cwswas,"The accountants will eventually balance the books. Unless your company has crappy bean counters (in which case, how are they still in business?), they’ll eventually figure it out. I’m gonna call NAH but I will say it’s probably in your best interest, and that of your coworker’s, to let them know about the error."
cwsyt8,NTA- he sounded worried if he was in danger and couldn’t get hold of anyone you could of saved his life.
cwsywc,"YTA, you literally asked the Vice-Captain to take her off the team so you can be on it instead"
cwszjo,"NTA - Why should you have to lie about your life to keep your mothers image up? You aren’t painting her as a liar, she IS a liar. Instead of telling the truth, she has painted herself into a corner and now she’ll have to deal with that."
cwt4yb,"YTA

Your roommate is right, it has nothing to do with him. You made multiple decisions that put yourself in the position of having to pay double rent, your roommate never forced you to make any of those decisions. It's not his problem that you can't find someone else to cover your part of the rent. If I were your roommate, I would've recommended you look for someone to rent the room from you, and I'd help verify that they're sane, normal people in person when they visit the apartment. 

If he were a billionaire and didn't want to pay your part of rent, he *still* wouldn't be an asshole, cause it's his money and again, he didn't force you to put yourself in a position to pay rent for two places. 

Is it really unfortunate that you're bleeding money on a place your not living at? Yes, definitely, I'd sympathize with you. Is it justified for me to bleed money to cover your ass, for choices that you made? I think not."
cwt551,"Former Disney Cast Member here,
You’re going to get sweaty in the park all day, I would bring the shirts in the bag if you want to take the photos with the castle lit up at night (totally recommended btw). But in the end your cousin probably won’t care what she’s wearing bc she’ll be engaged, tell your aunt that you’ll have Mr & Mrs ear hats made for them so they can wear those for pix (super cute btw)"
cwt5kq,"YTA for how you phrased it... 

People have brain farts all the time, especially in front of people you find cute. You could've laughed it off and said ""adopted people can have siblings too silly"", but instead you practically went for an insult on her momentary lapse of intelligence in front of someone you recognized that she showed interest towards."
cwt7uq,"YTA

You know your wife only eats creamy and you bought crunchy only because it’s cheaper? Do you even like it? And your wife is right. She gets what you like, it wouldn’t kill you to get what she likes when you know what that is.  

This is also very petty by the way."
cwtadw,[deleted]
cwtar6,"YTA.

Don’t go accusing anyone of anything without the necessary facts, especially not in a public forum. It’s fair for you to be wary of her and you could even privately warn others to be aware but unless you know for certain don’t confront her."
cwtbuo,"NTA 

Touching someone’s food is a declaration or war man.. especially after you telling her not to.. maybe it’s just my inner fatty but you’re totally in the right here"
cwtcql,NTA.. they should just use each other as alibis and keep you out of it.
cwtkau,"NAH.

As her current husband he would generally be considered immediate family, hence her point.

From your perspective I totally understand why you didn't want him on there.

Did you consider that she wanted him there just to save face?

If she's ""thinking"" about leaving that means she hasn't made any concrete actions to do so.

Until she does she probably doesn't want to give any part of the family rumor mill something juicy to gossip about."
cwtl42,"NTA. 

But I’d be worried about legal troubles if he were to find out."
cwtmg9,But he lost his keys so shouldn’t that be entirely on him? Or at least have it taken out of his security deposit?
cwtnez,"YTA for the unprofessional sabotage but working together would have been difficult since you are clearly still bitter. Being honest that you two had a history and you wouldn’t be comfortable would have been better. I have a similar situation in a way. My ex is in my industry and I’ve given a lot of thought to how I will handle it and that’s what I will say when the inevitable situation of being assigned the same project happens. I’m in a higher position so I feel being diplomatic will look better on me than petty. No matter how, though, I will not be subjected to working around him and I totally get why you needed to avoid that. Sometimes it’s ok to be TA."
cwtnkr,"NAH. Starbucks demands that their workers do the condescending little education thing if you refuse to use their jargon. It’s obnoxious, but they don’t have a choice. The important thing is that you got your coffee.

ETA: Maybe it was just the anal retentive manager my son had. He was hounded about this repeatedly and came home complaining about his boss expecting him to alienate people who just wanted some caffeine."
cwtrej,"NTA.

Unless you think there is abuse going on, it's really never a good idea to tell a friend you don't like their established SO. If they had been dating for two days it would be one thing, but a year in, you missed your shot."
cwtrmm,NTA. If it was a big deal he should of said something about it yesterday. It's like eating all your food and then complaining about it.
cwtry2,NTA Just a weeb
cwtttn,"NTA.

This might be a bit of personal brigading on my part but the way we as a culture excuse the shitty behavior of those who are older than us is total bullshit. Calling someone ""huge"" is not helping nor is it an example of someone who is truly trying to help. Your aunt was taking her personal struggles out on her niece. Cut that shit out."
cwtwd0,"NTA, but when speaking to entitled people, you should learn to just say “no, that won’t work for us” instead of JADEing (justify, argue, defend, explain)."
cwtxal,NTA - buckle up.  It might be a long year.
cwtxn3,"NTA, lol that dude needs to start taking responsibility for his own decisions."
cwu0se,YTA - Man who gives a shit where the meme came from?
cwu21h,"NTA 

You made a statement that you didn’t want to be friends with him, and he overheard on your plans and invited himself in, regardless of the fact. Sounds like an asshole move on his end."
cwuct5,NTA- even if it was her fridge she abandoned it for 18 months. It is now your fridge. I wouldn’t bother offering her any money for a new fridge. It’s totally not necessary.
cwuhgi,NAH as long as your dog was leashed. It was totally fine for her to be afraid. And it's totally fine for your dog to continue to exist next to her.
cwuldi,"You made a plan, but it would have been convenient for your mom to pick it up.  You making a stink over it means both parties suck - ESH."
cwuros,[deleted]
cwurvm,NTA. Recycling is more about making money anyway. There are huge energy costs to recycling and it's net carbon positive for a lot of products (only metals like aluminum and copper are heavily carbon negative IIRC). You would do much more for the environment by reducing and reusing.
cwuvs1,"NTA. 

What a bizarre expectation they have of you. It's their day, not yours."
cwuwtw,"NTA

I don't like being around trashy people either."
cwuwwv,"Nta. That's just rude and disrespectful. If you're hanging out with someone (regardless of if it's friend, partner, family or even the mail man) you should be taking to them not your phone. Yeah check and answer txt every now and then but otherwise she should put the phone away.
It's not even that she's addicted to it if she's able to put it out of sight with other people.
Seems like you're just not a priority and she doesn't value time with you the same way she does her friends. You deserve better."
cwuxvs,"YTA - first of all, YOU shouldn’t reschedule anything without her say-so. It’s BOTH of your trips, so stop pretending you’re the one who gets to make all the decisions. 

Secondly, you’re definitely making it seem like the trip is only about sex, and if that’s off the table you’re just not interested. I’m sure your girlfriend feels GREAT knowing the only reason you want to vacation with her is because you’ll get laid. 

Try to remember that your girlfriend is a person and not a walking vagina."
cwuzhh,"Well... yeah. YTA. You said you would pay him back and agreed to the terms, then failed to meet your obligations."
cwv13n,"NTA . If she knew in advance that she was going to this event, she should have asked off. If you already have plans, you have no obligation to throw them away because she didn't plan ahead, especially if there were other family members that could also take the shift.

Also, her language sounds manipulative and projecting. You are willing to help her and do things for family. You have a life too, and it's low-key abusive behavior that she's trying to guilt trip you."
cwv1ci,[deleted]
cwv2we,"YTA your daughter is 20 and can eat as she pleases. For such a small woman 2 chicken sandwiches and 2 slices of pizza plus some fruit as snack is plenty of food. resent studies also suggest eating 3 square meals is actually worse than having several smaller meals throughout the day.

you're going to dramatically damage your relationship with your ADULT daughter if you dont back off. Her doc says she is in weight range so leave it be."
cwv54z,"NTA. You don't HAVE to be friends with anyone, but we've all done some weird thing in our past that we'd like to forget about. Let this girl have a chance to move on from her past and reset herself."
cwv564,"Burning incense indoors and inhaling it over long periods is harmful. It’s equivalent to letting someone chain smoke around your kid and bake them in a room.

As far as the vertigo, that doesn’t seem to be too much of an issue as to whether the kids should be over there.   Letting them fester in a room full of incense smoke seems to be the problem here."

cwvb2f,"YTA. This post reeks of jealousy and insecurity, instead of being mad at her, see if you can learn something from her. I’m an introvert, but I still love going out with friends."
cwvb46,"YWBTA if you skipped it entirely. Ten days is unreasonable, but you need a really good reason to skip your brother’s wedding and ‘I’m anxious about my cat’ isn’t a good one. Flying in and out in two days also isn’t super reasonable— at least stay for a few days. Try and see a therapist if you can soon to get some help dealing with this anxiety, but you should go."
cwvdtq,NTA. You can't invade someone's privacy when they are loud enough to hear from inside your own home.
cwvevw,"NTA

Other Owner is upset that he is no longer being given a privilege due to the changing in ownership of (what is now) your house.  He is acting like an asshole.  You, and the tenant, are not assholes."
cwvhh6,YTA. Your boyfriend (of 4 months!) barely knows you. Why would you expect him to be over the moon about going to a wedding of people he’s never met? Sounds like you are rushing things and placing unrealistic expectations on him. Don’t expect this relationship to last.
cwvi9l,"NTA

you should tell a teacher that he’s being difficult to work with"
cwvipq,"NTA - I get it, I’m a germaphobe myself.  How about going out to a restaurant?"
cwvmf1,"NTA but your bosses may not agree so if they say ""take care of her"" then you have to do so, but I know you may get contradictory instructions ""help her""/""Don't go past 11"""

cwvp3u,"NTA. I mean, what the fuck is with all of these people? That's such blatantly awful and creepy behavior, it should have been a no-brainer.

EDIT: I really can't get over this dude going to the bathroom to place the pen, getting caught, and then GOING BACK TO THE BATHROOM to place it again. Jesus christ man. I'd be going scorched earth with anybody who didn't agree this was some terrible shit."
cwvzoh,"NTA, this is why you don't mix money and family or do things outside of a contract especially with such a big amount of money."
cww3fr,"NTA

Free sweater lol. Who knows what would have happened to it. Hopefully you can find the owner."
cww4fc,"YTA - for asking Reddit if you should sue someone. 

your misdiagnosis does not directly cause you to lose your job, your wife or anything. That is how you handled that misdiagnosis.  A misdiagnosis isn’t exactly an offence you can sue for - you have to prove it was negligent or was malpractice. Are you sure you can prove that? You should be suing your employer. 

If you are going to sue, we aren’t the people to ask. You should talk to a lawyer."
cww6qm,"Umm, NTA. YOUR duties come before anybody else’s desires, and you had a perfectly rational reason to not house-sit, as well as a very reasonable argument for why this lady shouldn’t go on this vacation if she can’t afford a house-sitter. The moment she told you to abandon your child for such a significant chunk of the day was the moment she became an Asshole with a capital A. Tell her to fuck off, and if your aunts and friends and whatever take her side over yours, it shows that they aren’t the kind of people you want in your life, anyways."
cww7q2,YTA. This is nice guy behavior. Just back off and stop making inappropriate jokes to women who obviously don’t want them.
cww9fe,"NAH - It is nice that your parents want to take her on this long trip to the airport, but I don’t think you should feel obligated to be with her right up until the last available minute just for sentimental purposes. I come from a loving family, but I wouldn’t expect one of them to drive that far to drop me off at the airport, and definitely not three people."
cwwfj1,"NTA. It's your space, not his, and you don't have to compromise until you move in together. The fact that you've asked him to stop and he hasn't is the cherry on top of his asshole sundae."
cwwrat,"NTA

Her behavior is definitely not normal. You can try talking to her, but it may not work. If she doesn't want to change, it might be time to try some tough love and go low contact."
cwx0bz,"NTA, print out your statement, highlight the charges, and ask her if she mistakenly used the wrong card to pay for these items. Give her a chance to explain herself. If she confesses and tries to say she’s entitled to your money, then she’s the asshole."
cwx11k,NTA. They should have checked to see that you were with them before riding off.
cwx18u,"NAH, because the ""wife"" isn't a part of the question. Makes it easier. Anyway, what you described is the kind of abuse that can go on for another 10 years, because no one will do what you did. I personally would stand firm in my resolve, and possibly poll mutual friends to see if they agree. Of course your friend is going to get defensive, because so many people don't  see controlling behavior, emotional blackmail and indirect anger as abuse.

People are telling you to let her figure it out, but  can you stand by for the next decade and watch what you think is abuse?"
cwx78n,"NTA - If she excelled and then suddenly started behaving unacceptably, it was not your job to stage an intervention. She ruined this opportunity for herself."

cwxh47,NTA : You’re an adult so the rules shouldn’t be the same for you as they are for his teenage children. Your father recently died and neither him or your mom should be trying to push the step dad role onto you. I completely understand why you’d lose it like that. It still too soon for him to be trying to take your fathers position. He probably means no harm but he has to understand given the circumstances and why you’d feel the way you do.

To be honest I think this is all very odd, him being this old and wanting roommates when he has a girlfriend and a kid on the way, seems very immature to me.

To change his mind on the day and invite people you don't get along with is a dick move of epic proportions. Maybe it's a bit petty, but he deserves it - if he can suddenly change his mind (ON THE DAY) and turn a date into his own social outing, with people he knows will leave you out, then you have every right to not go. Especially if you're going to be stranded there, unable to leave when it gets too much for you.
Personally, I'm just glad he told you he invited them and didn't just spring it on you when you got there, so you had this chance to refuse."
cwydn0,"You are absolutely NTA. I’m so sorry for your traumatic experience. I think some people have absolutely no understanding of the overwhelming emotional feelings about what you are describing. I’m sure it’s not malicious though.

Not for how you reacted, but for the thought of missing out on someone's celebratory dinner for something minor like no meat.  As someone who crushes ribs like it's my job, if I went to a friend's dinner and he asked for no meat I would oblige in a heartbeat!  Part of friendship is being there for people and not being selfish during their moments.

I would be angrier at your friend who suggested not attending a dinner celebrating someone getting their first job out of college because they can't eat meat or think someone came off brash in asking for a meat free  meal.

Also, the suggestion to pay a separate meat bill is a little tacky and would annoy me if I was the person who asked for no meat.  It's a ""we acknowledge but we ignore"" type of mindset that I personally don't love.

Don't overthink this OP.  Go to dinner and celebrate your friend, instead of worrying about the food situation!"

It  may be emotionally satisfying in the moment to attack whatever one can  most easily attack, but I'm just not the type of person who will  redirect to another angle of attack when challenged like that.

cx16j0,"NAH.  I imagine that your sister actually is pretty traumatized by the fact that her birth mother has completely rejected her not once, but twice now.  I think she’s looking for someone to empathize with her trauma because hey, misery loves company.  You share this common “source” of her trauma, adoption, so she’s trying to bring you on board. 

Your sister should talk to a counselor or therapist, because the way she’s dealing with these new revelations isn’t healthy, but it’s also not surprising.  And for your part, I think you are correct in your assessment that everyone was better off with your adoptive parents.  I would encourage you, however, to recognize that she’s in pain and manage yourself accordingly in the future.  

I don’t think you’re an asshole for blowing up at her, because you likely felt defensive, but apologizing to your sister anyway would be a good idea.  Her pain is real to her, whether you subscribe to it or not.  She needs support right now and she’ll get through this.

Edit:  Wow this blew up, my first gold!!  Also, thank you for all the comments about rejection.  I definitely agree with everyone that is saying bio parents gave a child up for adoption not because they were rejecting them, but because they were making a decision that would most benefit the child, out of love and care.  I do wonder if OP’s sister could use that information to help re-frame the way she sees what happened.  I do think she may feel rejected, even if that wasn’t how it really was when her mom made the tough decision to give her up.  Thanks everyone!"

She might have been worried that if she told you about it, word would have gotten back to her superiors and she'd be blacklisted from moving forward.

Since you say that this would be a big expense right now it shows that you're aware of the cost so my question would be why didn't you think of the costs before setting up the event?

cx63pd,"NTA. It sucks for her that you can’t help, but she’ll figure something out just like she did over the summer. You need to worry about your health and happiness. You answered her email stating that you couldn’t do it. I’m sure she will understand and is grateful for the time you did give them."
cx66od,NTA your destiny is yours to choose. They can be disappointed all they want. You don't have to enslave yourself because it's what they want.

cx6bum,"YTA. Behavioral issues have causes. Two years ago, something happened that changed her and you'd be failing as a parent if you threw her out instead of figuring out what went wrong. Sounds to me like you expect a therapist to do your job for you and want to quit because it isn't working."

cx6fjw,"NAH but I think you made the wrong decision. Your sister knows you're an atheist and still asked you because it was more important to her that her daughter's godfather be someone who would love her daughter, support them through their life, and is otherwise a morally upstanding person. I'm also nonreligious but am the godfather to one of my friend's sons."

cx75cz,"NTA - you're not required to be close to members of your family just because their 'family'. But nowhere did you mention that you said anything to him about his behaviour. Did you ever tell him to cut the bitching as it was putting a damper on things? Or did you just stew in silence? This is your dad's brother, and clearly important to him. I would suggest trying to remedy the situation before a complete cutting-out-of-my-life scenario."
cx77i6,"YTA - first and foremost it's your wife's medical history, not yours.  Her appointment, her body, her medical information.  She didn't lie or leave anything out, she's still genetically connected to her sister, regardless if she's her half sister or not.  You definitely overstepped.  And if you have a problem with what she said to the doctor, you talk to HER about it first and encourage her to share her information with the doctor, don't do it for her."
cx78xp,"ESH, they sound like awful roommates but just telling them to their face that they don't 'deserve' the app is a definitely a dick move.

Sounds more like they can't afford it really so just go to the landlord and explain to him/her that your roommates don't have reliable or low income. Landlords hate people that can't afford rent (it's the truth y'all)

The biggest issue or Trump card would be who's name is on the lease, because if it's yours and they are only subletting from you then you could just kick them out. But if it's the other way around then you're fucked."
cx790f,NTA - That sounds exhausting and I don't blame you for stepping away from it.   You need to take care of your own mental health first.

 What the hell is a proposal celebration anyway?  Is it an engagement party? 
A proposal should be a private moment between two people, so there is a chance to decline in a dignified and discreet way. Either they have both agreed to get engaged, in which case it's not a proposal, no just a creepy staged photo opportunity, or he's putting this poor lass in a horrible position where she can't say 'no' without major embarrassement.
Once the couple have agreed to wed then an engagement party is an option and it would be polite  and practicalto give folks some decent notice.
You arranged your vacation a long time ago. I'm sure you'll be delighted to attend the wedding and any planned engagement celebration and you'll give the couple lots of your time then. Right now your time is allocated to your family.
Don't be manipulated into attending. It's very short notice and your family deserve your company too."

But also, you're within your rights to refuse and that doesn't make you an ass."
cx81x6,NTA Having him at your house and feeding him when you were kids is because he was a child and had no other options. But he's an adult. Yeah his situation sucks and that might be the reason why he makes poor decisions but if he's not getting better and making the same mistakes over and over again then there's not much you can do about it. Sometimes people have to fail to get their shit together. I'm sorry you're going through this but  no longer enabling him is the right thing to do.

cx8jm0,"NTA - As a former cringe weeb, I can tell you this guy is full on just fetishising a culture and not just the 2D girls and anime hype. He is behaving like a complete tool and if he doesn’t have many friends besides you, I think he is showing the reason why. You never need a friend who belittles you and flat out bullies you, and makes disgusting comments on your culture/background, why have enemies with a friend like that around to do it for you? 

Also his behaviour is full on creepy, I love japanese culture and fashion but have never gone around proclaiming some bs about how every other race is ‘ugly’ in comparison to slim Japanese models (especially as a non-Japanese person). Part of me feels he is negging you so hard because he actually deluded himself on his summer away, he very likely creeped out or moderately offended a few people there but still feels superior from just having the opportunity to go there.

Either way, you need to chip in if you were told you pay 1/3 of all utilities."

I dunno, that could be a long shot based on very little information and is quite possible just me projecting. Your brother might just be inconsiderate.

cx9qi3,"ESH. 

For one it sounded like you promised your boyfriend a kitten before either of you even got approval to do so. Then when your parents finally agree to allow it you tell your mom to rehome it somewhere else so she'd stop bothering you. You gave it away for own convenience even though you had the choice to allow him to have it. 

Your boyfriend shouldn't have cats if several of them end up as roadkill. Your mom was right about them being indoor and fixed, etc. The conditions she placed were not unreasonable,  even if she already agreed to it. And really I wouldn't have promised a kitten to someone who lets their cats out so often several have become roadkill and they also have their own litter of kittens, which tells me their cats aren't fixed either, which isn't responsible. Maybe I'm not understanding something but you don't make your boyfriend out to be a responsible pet owner, which also makes you suck a bit for trying to give a pet to someone like that. 

Your parents suck for flip-flopping on what they agreed to and for putting all these conditions for adoption just for them to give the kitten to someone who's ""shady""."
cx9ubk,ESH. You're all exhausting. And stop using letters for people. It's nearly impossible to keep track of what's happening here. Why do you all need to be on this group convo? I would drop out early if I didn't have to be there for this.

Yes, her logic is ridiculously dumb. However, telling her so is not going to win you any friends with your girlfriend’s family, especially in the middle of a family dinner. It also feels a bit like you’re kicking her when she’s down if her life is as much of a mess as you say.

Calling somebody’s argument nonsensical is also not an effective rhetorical technique. It’s just going to make them defensive, which means they won’t listen to another word you say. You obviously don’t have to agree with her, but you don’t have to start a fight either. 

The last point I’m going to make is that you seem to have very negative views of people with mental health issues, and you might want to reexamine your feelings and biases about them. Having mental health issues has no bearing on her views about cooking and the patriarchy."
cxas8a,NTA. Unless you are Japanese that child will be made fun of mercilessly for such ridiculous names.

If it was for the drinks alone and such as another commenter said then I would agree with you not being an AH but the use of other people to make yourself feel better tipped it to me.

Edit: To the person calling me out as an asshole because I should understand that sexuality is on a spectrum, yes, I understand that. The issue is that that issue is irrelevant in this because he's said before he was straight. As in no interest in guys. 
I feel the point is being taken away from what makes him the asshole. Don't ban straight people from the bars, don't force people out cause that's what they did to us and it makes us worse. The issue in the core place is that he is using us to make himself feel better. If a woman does that she's the AH if a guy does that in a straight bar he's the AH and if a guy uses gay people just trying to have a good time to make himself feel better then yes, he is an AH.
I'm already seen as a fetish item to many people, I don't want to be led on or used in one of the few places I feel safe to be myself."

Talk to her in private. Ask her if she knows that she smells bad and that it bothers people. Ask if she has any problems and if you can help. 


I know I smelled bad, like extremely bad, during my depression. It was either go to work without showering and in dirty clothes or not get out of bed at all. I knew I smelled horrible, but it was still a victory for me to be there. Staying in bed made me even more suicidal.

I needed help, didn't know how to ask for it."

>asked her if she loved me more then god

What kind of a jerk asks this sort of question and then is surprised by the answer? She does pray a lot but asking her to stop is ridiculous. The only ground you have to stand on is not wanting her to ask you to pray with her, but she isn't an asshole for asking.

EDIT. I saw your edit and wanted to address it. If she is upset and asks you to pray with her then chances are she just wants you to be with her to comfort her. Especially after the death of a loved one. So I amend what I said, her asking you to pray with her is not ground you have to stand on.

EDIT. Girlfriend found the post and gave some additional information. Her mom has cancer which is why she has been praying so often. This is so clear cut YTA."

I'm willing to bet he isn't upset that you don't like it and is instead upset that you're treating him worse for it. If you can't look at him the same, leave him, but don't keep expecting him to make it right when it had nothing to do with you, and it's history."

1.	It's shit but she is more likely to be in danger than you. If you feel safe then you shouldn't have to share the location for the reason of being safe. [edit: look argue that men are more likely to be involved in violent crimes all you want and it is true but often that is a punch up outside a bar not an armed one on one robbery, kidnapping or rape situation. Your figures are meaningless because they are too generalised]
2.	Maybe agree to do it when you go out together in a crowded place or on a night out or something as then it genuinely is safer plus if you loose your phone it can sometimes help track it down?
3.	There should be no problem doing this, me and my partner do it, as long as you trust the partner not to abuse the feature. Tbh my partner and I have had apple share our location for over a year and i forgot it was on till i read this. She is right, in an emergency it may be useful.
4.	It is a invasion of both your and her privacy. If she is happy to sacrifice that privacy for safety that is fine, if you aren't that is also fine.

cxhihk,"NTA

Your mother is an adult, whether she takes your job seriously or not she should still respect that there are certain boundaries you can't cross with a work place. Inviting her to the open day is perfectly great option, if she wants to see your work she shouldn't be upset that she can't just come in with you.  

She seems very curious which is all well and good, but even if she's not enjoying her work anymore, it doesn't mean you should jeopardize your own employment just so she can come see the equipment."

cxhyus,"NTA. She was an hour late. When she was 40 minutes late, you texted her that you were leaving so she shouldn't have been surprised that you were gone come 12.  This doesn't have to be a friendship ender but she has to understand that you didn't have all day to wait.  You ignoring one phone call isn't an over-punishment for her repeated lateness. Pop her a text when you've cooled down and say ""Hey, this doesn't have to be a friendship ender but I was super-annoyed. I was looking forward to seeing you but by minute 40, I was bitter. I feel like you don't value my time and I don't want to wait like that again."" You might not hang out for a bit but maybe next time she'll be on time."

cxi1xh,"YTA - she's right that she'll be the one to wear it everyday and she was pretty explicit about what she wants.

It’s not like they didn’t give you a suitable tank when they gave you the turtles you’re saying that the turtles outgrew the tank. That’s on the pet owner not on the previous owner.

You ask several questions but the bottom line is that you can’t control other people and need to stay out of relationships that aren’t your own.

The idea that it’s none of your business and you should just let this person carry on being lied to and betrayed is bullshit. But regardless, since it affects your relationship, you now have even more of a justification. HOWEVER, I think that the best course of action is to tell your brother “look, you need to either cut this shit out, or come clean to your wife. If you don’t tell her by X time, I am going to. And if I get contacted by one more person, I’m not checking with you before I send it off to her.” That way he has the option of doing the right thing himself (which is really what should happen), and it’s only if he fails and continues his shitty behavior that you do anything. The fault is clearly with him."

cxlb66,ESH - he's got the time for it but you're creating a lot of extra mess that you're expecting him to clean up. Maybe you should clean up your boxes and dishes and he should do everything else.
cxlbwh,"NTA - you do what you need to do for your mental health. Your parents are TA as they forced you into it. Your boss will be fine, as he’ll probably find someone new quite quickly"
cxll9t,"NTA

she’s TA tho for wanting to get in your life when she knows your wife is pregnant during your honeymoon and then calling you out when you say no."
cxllj0,"NTA. He never should have invited somebody to your wedding. Period. Doesn't matter who she is, it's not his place."
cxln7p,"NTA - LMAO at this sub who think it's okay to break lease agreements if there's a dog involved.

I fucking love dogs, but part of being a dog owner is respecting those around you and this person did not do that at all.  Her fault for not moving into a complex that allows dogs."
cxlncl,NTA i hate the replies asking why it even matters. it’s not just a flag it’s a symbol of representation and the lesbian community is constantly ignored unless they’re being sexualized. good on you for noticing and speaking out.
cxlspy,"You would be the asshole, but you have to to what you have to do."
cxlth4,"NTA

She didn't just ""leave them out"" she set the recovering addict up and that's fucked up."
cxlw1q,[deleted]
cxlwzv,YTA. Have you considered trying to stop whining and complaining about your grades and then nobody would offer up comforting words?
cxlxe0,"NAH - I can see everyone's points. The list of things your landlord gave your mom did have a lot of petty things that most would ignore, but none are ridiculous. The point of a security deposit/bond is to pay for repairs if the occupants won't, so it's fair game for your mom to decide to let it go."
cxly8x,NTA. I would advise not adopting your SIL child though. Too close to family so a lot of potential drama when the kid is older and understands the situation
cxmbtc,"NTA. It's great to see family when you're at college, but it's also a time to learn to operate as your own person. These first few weeks are going to be a time to settle into school and life and will be full of opportunities for you to meet people and make friends. They absolutely need to let you have this time to acclimate to college."
cxmg28,"I think ESH right now. You guys need to get together and prioritize what needs to be moved first make all the other stuff as easy as possible to shuffle around, and then you should probably all work on it together so it's done quickly and orderly. However you should be packing all your stuff up into boxes and have it ready to go ASAP."
cxmh8l,"NTA. I had originally written ESH... BUT I think there are a few things to think about here. Firstly, your mum definitely sucks for breaking her promise to you and prioritising your piano lesson over you being able to properly say goodbye and/or grieve your pet. Losing a pet is an awful feeling that cuts deeply, and she denied you the ability to deal with that situation with the time and space you needed, while also breaking a direct promise. She is definitely *one of* the assholes.

Obviously, 12yo you was not the asshole, and you weren't an asshole for asking her about why she did it. That said, when she started escalating you gave in and escalated too. This is where you could potentially have been TA, but on the other hand you tried for a long while (from the sounds of it) to keep your cool and be an adult about it, while she reacted childishly and never gave you a straight answer, instead sending it via your dad when he went to play peacemaker. The fact she did that was also assholish, imo.

In short, NTA but I do think you should apologise for your language and for losing your cool, since you said swearing isn't something you do with her and I don't agree with rising to the same level as an asshole, even if there are situations that call for it. I would hope she would apologise as well, since she is clearly TA across this whole thing, but I wouldn't bet on her doing it. I think you should be the bigger person and just nip this whole conflict in the bud, since with parent-child relationships both sides should also choose their battles. 

Whether or not you can (or should) forgive her is really a conversation for you and your therapist, but in the short term I think an apology for losing your cool/language (but NOT for asking the questions!) will keep things on kilter."
cxmkz6,NAH. But you're going to have to get on the same page as your wife. You cannot be separate on this issue and you need to act as a team. If she's saying that she's spent time with him over the past year and sees a change... then you need to trust her.
cxmqxi,"YTA but that doesn't mean that it wouldn't be funny or you shouldn't do it. Might be funnier to hand out daycare cards for these adult toddlers, then it has nothing to do with mental health."
cxmrqq,"NTA - If she lets the sisters dye their hair, then he absolutely should be able to dye his. You did what you knew would make your son happy, and he IS happy. Sure - you should run something by the other parent before making a big decision, but if it’s something as simple as a hair dying (and it was a natural color), then it’s fine IMO. Plus - she was being irrational about it at first, AND she ended up liking it."
cxmxnq,You should push the idea of him going to therapy as much as humanly possible. He needs it.
cxmyji,That doesn't necessarily mean OP is tired though
cxn0u2,"NTA, he wanted to get you drinking alcohol to make it easier to ""get"" in your pants. 100% guarantee that's what he was doing, cause if he genuinely wanted to talk to you he would have been fine with getting you food."
cxn1lp,"YTA - She’s not using the name because of you, it’s because of your mom. It’s not only “your” middle name, it is her MOM’s middle name. That’s incredibly entitled of you. You know you can share middle names, right?"
cxn7hc,"NTA, but I'd approach it differently.

I'd ask them ""Why didn't you discuss this with me before inviting your friend?"", because *that* is what you'd like to know.

After that, tell him ""I'm not comfortable with you inviting strangers into my home. Please uninvite them."""
cxnazo,"NTA

The wife is crazy. But your brother has decided for some stupid reason that he accepts that, and sadly, you can't do much about it."
cxndob,NTA. Your roommate is a bully.
cxnfv3,"NTA 

You tried and reach out multiple times, and he rejected each approach. Sorry OP, this must be rough but you don’t need his ass, he sounds pretty garbage if you ask me"
cxnhox,"NTA

You've been very reasonable. She wanted to go back on what was already agreed, so she's doing that. I'm coming down slightly on her being the AH because she has changed the agreement on you, but really there need not be any awkwardness or nastiness here."
cxnno2,"Nta, just because your brother does something stupid, you shouldn’t suffer for it. It’s your rates that will increase and all this crap will fall back on you. Idk if he has a job, but he should get one to atleast start paying for his own stuff. Totally support you in this. If your mom supports him so much, let her pay for him."
cxnof1,NTA If the coach intentes on filming minors and putting it online for any reason there needs to be consent forms from the parents.
cxnqc3,"YTA- Probably not terribly taboo, but really none of your business."
cxnro4,"NTA. You have your boyfriend's permission to go with friends. Theres nothing romantic or anything that would make it ""cheating"". You're completely fine. Go have fun"
cxnveq,NTA. 10 minutes doesnt seem like an unreasonable time to be late plus it was unintentional.
cxnvlk,"NTA, I've never worked at Target but I'm pretty darn sure that with a year's notice she could, in fact, take a specific weekend next August off if she was motivated to do so"
cxnvna,"I guess I'm going against the grain, but NTA, for sure. It sounds like you basically have two children to deal with now instead of one, thanks to your MIL forcing her unwilling kid onto you. Does the niece know you plan to pay her? If so she's being a brat not doing her job. If not, then her attitude is more understandable. I say go ahead and take her halfway home just to let the situation cool, but say ""no thanks"" for future babysitting help offers from MIL's direction."
cxnw4d,NTA. Thats an exceptional accusation to say masturbating is softcore cheating.
cxny4u,"I’m torn between NAH and YTA...let me explain.

I’m an avid concert-goer, and they can get emotional. I cried three times during a Paul McCartney concert.

Even so, your son might need to see a therapist. I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), and this sounds a lot like something I would do. Not to say that he has BPD, merely suggesting maybe you get him checked. YTA for immediately going for an ultimatum instead of asking if everything is okay on his end. Remember kids have emotions and brains too."
cxo177,"NTA. You handled it respectfully and it's totally up to you who should be invited or not. It seems like they aren't happy with it but not only can you not really afford it, there's no point in inviting their son anyway. Not your fault that auntie and uncle dont like it"
cxo1yj,YWBTA IF you don't go to him first and ask what the heck is up
cxo2uu,"YTA. Not for your feelings, but for ‘sitting her down’ and telling her she needs to pay more attention to you. Reasonable things you could have said:

‘I’m so happy you’re such a wonderful mother, but I miss time with just you! Can we get a babysitter and have a date night soon?’

‘I’ve noticed you seem very stressed and not able to focus on much else besides the baby. Are there tasks to could be helping with that I’m not? Do you feel the balance of work is OK between us?’

What you said instead: ‘I’m jealous of all the attention you’re giving our baby. Don’t forget I am also a baby in need of attention!’"
cxo2xp,".... Surprisingly I'm going NTA here... That sounds infuriating

Edit: I feel like all the people saying not to tell her how to have fun, and the game developers allowing it for a reason, are missing the facts that she's dictating how much fun you get to have, and that game designers let you team kill in first person shooters too ... but getting pissed off at that choice is more reasonable? Huh?

You're playing a co-op game and she's refusing to cooperate and she's not just killing everything wild but also your pets, that's asshole behaviour best saved for personal worlds"
cxo99t,NTA the MIL should have kept that to herself
cxo9du,"\> I should just drop it because it was an accident,

NTA.  It wasn't an accident, because there was precedent and you were denied the ability to protect your shoes by putting them in a closet.  They should pay for the shoes IMO.  But either way you should stop nannying for an irresponsible pyramid-scheme nincompoop."
cxocrz,"YWBTA- you already said yes. Mind your words. (And obviously, if you just can’t hack it, you’ll uninvite him, you’ll just be the asshole- a more comfortable traveling asshole.)"
cxoe7c,"YTA - Saying that automatically shows you think she’d be the odd one out. And maybe you don’t ACTUALLY think that, I am not saying you do, but it 100% sounds like it. If I were in her shoes, I’d feel unwelcome, too. Again - you may have not meant it in a harmful way. But if she WAS going to feel like the odd one out, that was her decision to call. 

It’s kinda like telling someone you think they look fat in something - would you tell them that? No, you probably wouldn’t. It’s their decision to make on whether or not they feel fat in the clothing. Even if you don’t actually think they look fat, but know THEY might think they look fat, you still don’t say it, because it would put that bug in their ear that they look fat. Dunno if that makes sense, it looks confusing when typed out lol."
cxoi0v,NTA. Safety  and education first.
cxoj4a,YTA - she told you what she was comfortable with and you kept pushing and pushing. And you did try to manipulate her by bringing past things you have done for her up.

cxoj91,"NTA, but uh...your boyfriend is cool with his bff being an abuser?"
cxok9l,"NTA but likely your friends will want some support. 

Plus think of all the money you'll be making his mom spend on your behalf."
cxol7n,"NTA. The hero Gotham needs, IMO."
cxomdc,YTA you outed her without her permission. You never EVER do that.
cxoqfe,ESH. Next time each deal with your own money. Problem solved.
cxoqfm,"NTA. Doesn't bother me. I have seen others do it.  Many people remove shoes for long flights. 

Just don't cross your leg and put your foot next to your neighbor's knee/leg.

It might be more courteous if you do it preflight so you can save everyone from that potentially embarassing experience, especially if you have been in your shoes for a long time on a hot day."
cxoriu,"NTA - $2800 is incredibly unreasonable to expect anyone to spend unless they make really good money and can fully justify it. You are not being unreasonable at all, your family is."
cxp35c,"NTA. You're being a caring and loving SIL by staying away from the wedding and avoiding the shit show that will occur if you attend. If the BIL asks or begs, just stick to your decision because you can't control crazy and his family will only blame you for any and all issues.
I would suggest you and your husband take the newly weds out and celebrate their nuptials and let them know that you're there to support them and love them."
cxp8pw,"NTA, but... I think you're technically in the right, you didn't cheat or do anything terrible. But the idea of lending clothes to someone seems pretty intimate to me. Maybe that's not the right word. It's weird. I would feel weird doing that. So I get her reaction."
cxpa4u,"YTA. I think it’s really weird to exclude immediate family members from your wedding, and that’s what you’re suggesting doing. Having two kids there is not going to take the focus away from you. Your children should be there to celebrate their parents’ marriage, for the full experience.

And tbh, it’s kinda weird that you want brownie points for not yelling at them..."
cxpak0,"NTA. Whatever’s going on at your mothers house, it’s affecting your child. And your child always comes first. You’re being a good parent."
cxpbsw,"YTA.

Jealous and controlling, much?"
cxpc47,"NTA - if the dog is vicious, you don’t know when he’s going to snap. She should absolutely keep the dog locked up around children, aggressive dogs are very prone to attack children."
cxpeb4,"NTA,  you've been dating for a month?  You have no significant responsibility to her, she shouldn't even be asking."
cxpf0j,[deleted]
cxpf5d,YTA Thats super creepy dude. You dont just go around telling people you have a fetish about them.
cxpfoa,"NAH

It just sounds like you and him both had different expectations on what having your male friend go with you would look like.

He wasn't there and he only saw pictures so it's easy for him to make assumptions about what happened. It would have been good if you two had a conversation about what he was okay with and not okay with when it comes to your boundaries with other guys, that way you're both on the same page."
cxpj9x,YTA. Don't go back on your word and don't profit off friends.
cxpksn,"NAH

You tried and she insisted. Be thankful and let her appreciate what she gave you."
cxpmk0,"NTA. She has a job, the price of the lens isn’t even that high, and most importantly 17 is absolutely old enough to understand that if you break something borrowed, you need to replace, repair, or offer compensation for it."
cxpmpr,"NTA. You are under no obligation to share your children's personal medical information with anyone (unless it is in the child's benefit such as an allergy etc.) 

However, if your parents want to become involved with your son's life, they're bound to find out about his condition through observation and/or speculation. It's a tough situation because the dreaded conversation is very likely to come up anyway. 

I think your best bet would be to tell your mother ahead of time so you can prevent her from finding out the wrong way. Something like this might work: 

""My son has been diagnosed with autism. I love him very much and his condition has no effect on that. Though he may think and act differently, this has no effect on him being my son and I hope that others will see that and choose not to treat him differently. I am also aware of your views on the supposed correlation between vaccines and autism. If you want, I can provide you with evidence on the correlation between the two being heavily debunked, but if you still want to think his vaccinations caused his autism, I want to say one thing. I would rather my son be unique and loved than sick and dying from a terrible but *preventable* illness. If you want to be a part of his life, you have to accept him as he is and your views on medicine are no longer a permitted topic of discussion. I hope you understand."""
cxpp4m,"Are you asking if you're the asshole if you take the car back? In that case, no, NTA. It sounds like your SD is trying to take advantage of you. If you were a car dealership, how would you handle a non payment? She needs to learn what happens if you dont pay your bills. A hearty dose of reality should do the trick."
cxprfm,NTA imo. if you’re uncomfortable with the behaviour of someone you are completely within your rights to ask for someone else
cxpw9u,"YTA. 

It doesn’t make you less of a target. It does however make you more of an asshole."
cxpyc2,"NTA, but you can’t force her to allow it. If she won’t have it, that’s that. It’s a weird, shitty rule, but it is what it is."
cxpydx,Insurance fraud.  Not cool.
cxpyfy,"NTA and some advice.

Your going to learn in life that you can't stop your own life everytime you are given a better future because of your coworkers, customers, students etc.

Sometimes you will need to leave because of an opportunity you can't pass up, sometimes because your current job is eating at your soul and it's becoming damaging to you. Or sometimes because to need a change because you need a change.

I've left friends behind, I've felt like I abandoned some. But it doesn't make you tA"
cxq5m0,"YTA - I'll probably get downvoted but I speak the truth. Tipping is optional; some people tip nicely, some people don't tip at all. It's part of the job. I think asking about it is unprofessional, as rude as he may seem."
cxq856,[deleted]
cxq9fp,"NTA. omg, are there minor children living like this??? please call CPS!! and yes, help your dad leave, it sounds like hell."
cxqcjc,"I feel like ESH

Even if he's the bigger asshole, you kind of are one too. If you'd have stopped after you only removed the video, it would be obvious that he's the only asshole here. Removing his entire account was an overreaction."
cxqczr,"YTA - You also didn't format your paragraph or use apostrophes when needed, so maybe check your own grammar as well. Linguists aren't that pedantic and your friends already stated they hate it. You totally can help not being so condescending, just take a deep breath and keep it to yourself."
cxqf2b,"If she offered and he declined, then she is NTA. He can't expect her to always order the cheapest item on the menu because he insists on paying. If he's doesn't want to pay for the meal she wants, he should let her pay rather than get weird about it.

Edit: Also, the friends saying that she's an asshole for ordering what she wanted to eat because he ordered the cheapest option suck too."
cxqhq8,"NTA, there's no law or reasonable expectations here. It's the same thing as a motorcyclist using a GoPro. Film all you want bud."
cxqjhs,NTA not your fault people are stupid
cxqk29,"lmao NTA, you already stayed behind an extra two hours, they should be grateful they got that. 

(I hope nothing with your employer happens because you stayed overtime! My bosses get mad if we stay over when our shift ends.)"
cxql31,"NTA-
I have a sister so I totally understand the weird dynamic of sister relationships.

It seems like your sister could do a lot more growing up and needs to express her emotions better. I totally get why she was acting that way, since you mentioned the current stressors in both of your lives. 

Though, it’s still not your fault that she couldn’t be direct with her feelings. You asked if she would care if you didn’t go and she said “no.” Sounds like more of her issue. 

I could see why you would feel bad though. You sound like a nice person lol I would just be annoyed with her"
cxqm0n,"NTA - you've taught your brother a great lesson here, don't talk shit especially when you're not exactly better off 

Also,you have a right to defend yourself no matter what age you are"
cxqpkd,"NTA

You don’t owe your abuser anything, ever. It sounds like you have a good enough relationship with your brother that you will be able to work it out of you don’t go. At the end of the day, I would say prioritize your mental health."
cxqr5h,"NTA. Unfortunately I don't believe in saving spots like that, it's whoever comes first to the spot in a vehicle. 

They could have been polite about it, asking if you could find another spot vs trying to open your door, etc. It justifies the response you gave as well, at least IMO."
cxqu9x,"YTA suck it up but make it clear this is not going to be the norm.

Things happen and plans fall apart, that's when you ask friends/family for help. Expecting it all the time is not the same"
cxqulm,"Please order pizza, get beer, chips , snacks ,bring your PS4 and set yourself up in the living room in your ginch and do not leave when they plant themselves beside you. No matter how awkward it is . Take your living room back!!! NTA they can’t take advantage if you don’t let them"
cxqxcj,"YTA here. You used their money and you fucked up with it.

How far apart are these airports? Unless your state is huge, you might have done better to keep the original flights and put up with a longer drive."
cxr0ew,"YTA — what is it with your crazy sense of entitlement to someone else’s condo?  You are *adults*, and adults pay rent.

“We are two adults in our mid twenties paying the equivalent of a mortgage that could get us our own house, instead we are stuck in a tiny room in his mother’s condo that just barely fits the two of us and a queen sized bed.”

THEN MOVE"
cxr336,"NTA - lock the dog in his room during the BBQ.  If it bites someone, there might be lethal consequences"
cxr3k3,"NTA, your poor cat must have been so scared and confused. I'd be mad at him for that, not the scratches."
cxr4k2,"NTA, a lot or drivers think they can stop where ever they like to let off passengers without a care who they force to wait for them.

There is always a spot a little further away that is safer and doesn’t block people but selfishness usually prevails."
cxr5oy,"YTA ... if they have noticed to the degree of shouting at you to stop, what you are ACTUALLY doing is intrusive and far worse than you think it is.  They’ve noticed....it’s creepy. You need to stop before your newest acquisition is a shiny pair of handcuffs."
cxr69f,"NAH, explain to your grandparents that you love them very much but it is time for you to learn more and spend more time with your Dad’s side of the family."
cxr97c,"YTA you said she BEGGED to use it, seriously"
cxrbi4,I was homeless 30 years ago on San Francisco. Food was so hard to come by. Most people would welcome what you offer. Eating from a garbage can sucks.
cxrclr,"NTA, he's asking you to do something that he himself is unwilling to do. Fuck tradition, that's unfair."
cxrecn,"That sounds like a dramatic reaction to a pretty mild situation. 
He’s allowed to be uncomfortable if he can be normal about it. 
You’re allowed to do something you think will help your career. 

NAH."
cxrfsq,NTA that lady is an idiot plain and simple.
cxrg66,"I think it depends on what help means really. It might not mean, sit down and write it with him, it might just mean, can you give this a once over and let me know what you think. I don’t know if you’re an asshole if you say no but it does sound a little ...snobby I think?"
cxrhlk,"NTA

They don't have some sort of copyright on the idea. They are being childish school kids, and you have no reason to feel guilty for making the account. If anything, be proud of yourself for doing something that helped raise the spirits of someone else."
cxriwo,"YTA. Some people are in the party of “None of my business” when it comes to things like this but I am a firm believer of telling someone the truth if they know their SO cheated. And considering this person is supposed to be your FRIEND too, what kind of friend are you when he can’t even trust you to have his back in regards to something as hurtful as this? For shame."
cxrm8l,NTA - why would you pay for her lunch if you’re not also eating lunch?
cxrrsp,"NTA. College is extremely time consuming. It’s easy to fall behind. You’re not the parent, she is, she needs to monitor his homework, it’s her job. If she didn’t want to do it, she should have used a condom."
cxrsyk,YTA. Your friends and wife hit the nail on the head. 19 year old college kids are swamped in debt as it is and she could use the money. Is an extra five bucks an hour worth your morality? Idk dude.
cxrust,"NTA. He's being super, super childish. He goes there without you - what, you're only allowed to eat there if he's with you, but he can go whenever? What the fuck. That's ridiculous."
cxrxwl,"ESH. Your family for putting you in that situation. You for acting like you have to spend the night with your partner. It’s lawn games, have some fun and relax. “ I’d go with whoever.” Choose your words carefully."
cxs4rl,YTA: dude. You listed so many reasons on why you left her. And now you're going back. She's moving on and you need to find your own way to move on. She blocked you. That's a clear ass sign that she ain't interested. Any more interaction on your part and it's harassment.
cxs9lr,"NTA - your mom is full of it.

It is clear they were abusing and using you and the company has no one to blame but themselves. It REALLY should have clued them in that things were not good when the manager and the only employees all quit. You actually took the time to explain to them what they asked. I would LOVE to hear what ""logic"" your mother used to come to the conclusion you were in any way at fault."
cxs9qz,"YTA. You named your kids and now its their turn. They didn't invite you to caucus for a name. Using an alternative is bullshit, petty and insulting to them. Your counselor is an asshole too for suggesting that. You have no respect for your daughter and it shows."
cxs9x8,"NTA, seriously, two nights on an air mattress won't kill them."
cxsaun,"NTA. Oh my god you cannot buy someone food they never asked for and then ask them to pay you back after they already ate it! That was 100% a gift. 

If they’re adamant they want the money back just be honest and explain “I can’t afford that. I was never able to which is why I declined your offer to go out. I live paycheck to paycheck in the most literal sense of the term you can imagine. So if it’s that important to you go ahead and send the request. I’ll pay it back when I can, but know that could be weeks or months as I don’t see my financial situation changing any time soon.”

EDIT I would also express that you never asked for the food so she had no reason to buy it at all and if she expected to be reimbursed she should have made that clear in the beginning. Everything about what she did seemed like she was giving you a gift and 99.9% of the human population would have assumed the same thing you did"
cxsd6h,YWBTA - If you dont tell your best friend whats going on. This thing affect his WHOLE life.
cxse0c,NTA. As a trans person. Fuck them and their hateful gross cult for harassing people.
cxsg3s,"NTA but I wouldn’t say I don’t want to go, I would say I can’t get the time off work. Send a card and a gift. Ring before hand to hear all the wedding plans and sound excited for them. You can spare yourself the trauma but still show them support (and the love they aren’t showing you)."
cxsox7,"Nah. They're just worried about you. You don't need to tell everyone, but tell at least one person just in case."
cxspw9,"NTA. You made it clear what time you needed to leave and even compromised by staying almost an hour later. 

Totally unreasonable for them to threaten to kick you out. I’m so so sorry they’re so malicious."
cxsqqm,"NAH

You asked, they agreed to it. You're not forcing it upon them. You didn't take the cat and then dump it on their doorstep. You're even giving them more money for it."
cxsrmi,"YTA. You're preying on a young woman, probably because woman your age see how shitty of a person you are. You're a snob who values appearances and being seen at the right place over people and relationships. You're controlling and stuck up and you take everything as an offense.

Kindly leave your girlfriend and put your dining out budget towards some serious therapy."
cxsrwh,Nta because he definitely tried to guilt trip you
cxssnn,"NTA

I'm an EMT. You did the right thing. Better safe than sorry. You are not trained to determine what's going on with a patient, so anything that seems like an emergency to you, you should call the emergency services. You get to a trained operator who knows what to do, asks the right questions, and sends an ambulance if needed.
Incidentally , an ambulance would get sent to anyone having a seizure. I'm pretty sure the operator did not think the guy had a stroke (which usually does not manifest as seizure). Also, not every seizure is epilepsy, and if no one around the person knew he was epileptic, then the guy needs to go to a hospital even after he recovered."
cxsuzf,"ESH - she should’ve taken responsibility with her “stuff” and equally you shouldn’t have sold it - it’s not yours to make profit over.

What you should have done is simply get all her stuff and drop it round her new place for her to deal with. 

She sucks for just letting it collect dust at your parents but equally you suck for selling said stuff."
cxsymc,If you genuinely believe she made the will in sound state of mind then NTA. Her money her choice. What were her kids' view of having someone care for their mother so much when they weren't helping themselves?
cxszof,"NTA, if you're not feeling it don't bother. She's cancelled on you a bunch of times so it's not like you owe her. Just tell her you're not going to make it. I do like boozy lunches though"
cxt6mr,If this is real... NTA. Fuck people that smoke while pregnant
cxtba6,Your dad's gonna steal your money if he hasn't already
cxtbym,"NTA - Buyer beware. 

In a private transaction (wether it’s a real-life purchase or on a game is irrelevant) it’s 100% on the buyer to make sure that they’re happy with the purchase before making it. 

You’d only be TA if you somehow lied to make the sale. If he knew exactly what he was purchasing and chose to buy it, “I don’t want it anymore” is not a good enough reason to get a refund."
cxtfrb,"YTA.

She was already talking to a staff member, and it wasn't your place to decide if dogs are appropriate. There was no reason to straight up lie just to maintain your comfort. Next time just move if it really bothers you that much."
cxtg0z,[deleted]
cxtgxx,"NAH take the job. However there’s a bunch you can do to help! Hire a dog walker temporarily so that your wife doesn’t have to, possibly a cleaner for the short term too. Essentially anything you can outsource for two weeks give her the offer of doing that. 

Two weeks will pass, a better salary for your family has lots of benefits long term."
cxtity,Nta whispering is ok if nobody is near you but being loud is very assholeish and annoying to everyone in earshot.
cxtlkl,"NTA - and if you aren't ever ready to let him see her you dont have to.

Its your job to protect your child. You get to decide who in your extended family have access to your nuclear family.
If him being in your life would make you feel worse then that alone is likely to upset your child.

Tell your family to back off."
cxtlsr,"YTA - You gave her shitty, unsolicited feedback. Even just saying you like it when she wears makeup - unprompted - is a dick thing to do. It’d be like her saying you’d look better after losing 10lb or gaining muscle mass.

Graciously accept whatever outcome comes of it."
cxtmdx,NTA. It's rude to do that to other people no matter what situation you're in. You're a student just going about your business and have never done anything wrong to him. Tell him that once you're done you'll leave the bottle on the bench or something and that he needs to stop because he's burning away money you spent on those drinks as well when he pours it out.
cxto6k,"NAH

Try this 
You go to the engagement party and let your wife go on the trip"
cxtx8y,"YTA - you're going to have to do a lot of things in life because it's the right thing to do even though you don't want to. Its fine to be introverted and to politely say you need some alone time but it's not ok to be rude about it and from some of the things you say to people, it sounds like you are rude and not very tactful in your approach. If you have an issue with loud events, maybe you can make an appearance for the ceremony and then leave before the reception."
cxtzo1,"NAH, it seems like a reasonable request not to bring your kids to any random event without permission (or a real good last minute reason). It depends on how you bring it though.

I do think you might be overstating how important this day is to the other members though. Like, up there with *Christmas* for literally every member? Like, dude, it's a hobby. Calm down a bit."
cxu6wt,"Yes, that would be an asshole move but also pretty much deserved."
cxu98l,NTA its not cool to fuck your best friends mom
cxu9g8,NTA-if you want people to sign a contract that's up to you. But they have a right to disagree with it. Maybe you should be open to negotiations.
cxu9i0,"NAH. The brother did try to call and while you hung up on him accidentally you probably should've called him back since you were the one that hung up. That would be protocol, but you get a pass cause your father just passed. Now D I believe overreacted and should've played the role of the peacemaker, but he was in a tough situation too. Everyone needs to just let it go."
cxubnb,"ESH - If your friend gave you shit advice intentionally to make himself look better, he’s an asshole. But a girl isn’t somebody you can just call “dibs” on or whatever. Anyone can talk to her, however they like and it’s her choice who she does and doesn’t accept."
cxudqm,"NTA. She asked the question. She's acting like she's never even considered some people can be atheist or agnostic. She's also then asking stupid questions like ""Did he not deserve to go to heaven?"" while you just said you don't believe it exists.

Look, she's probably mostly just a bit of the rails because she's emotional from the grandfather dying. I wouldn't exactly hold it against her but her slagging you off to your coworkers (and even seemingly lying, or at least heavily misrepresenting what you said) is way over the line and you should probably go to HR pre-emptively."
cxuh5q,"YTA

You don't get to reserve public parking spots. Your mum was 2mins away...tough, she loses out. Your excuse is one of inconvenience and then what you did was to be an inconvenience to everyone else looking for a spot to park."
cxui3l,"I wanna lean ESH.

On your mothers part, i think she's being entirely unreasonable and overly demading. You may be her child, but you're also a grown ass adult with your own life to lead, not a servent at her every beck and whim.

On your part, I'm surprised you wouldn't assume that something would be happening for fathers day and have checked up earlier to see about organising things better. Granted not everyone is close to their father/father-figure, nor does everyone celebrate/recognise father's day. But from the context of your post, you seem to have no issues on that front as far as i know... so yeah. 

That's my spin on it... i feel like i could elaborate my point better/further but I'm not sure how."
cxut21,"NAH, and this is really above AITA's paygrade. Obviously this is extremely complex, and I couldn't judge you for not wanting to respond, or not knowing how to respond. Have you considered therapy with someone who specializes in adoption? This kind of issue must come up all the time, and it might help to hear how others have handled it, and to consider all the pros and cons and ethical implications with someone who knows what they're talking about."
cxuw0x,"NTA. Just that by itself is a kinda off, but i think you was right in holding it in case it happens again. If it does continue then its worth bringing it up. If he is comfortable enough to say that so soon then it will likely get bolder as time goes on."
cxuxmv,"NTA, but honestly also doesn't sound like y'all got a healthy sex life if he's acting like that. You shouldn't be feeling the need to fake it this much just to please him and keep your own comfort. But I also don't really see another way out for you if your boyfriend just flat out refuses to believe you."
cxv190,NAH. No reason to interrupt someone to greet them. However if in passing or they acknowledge you by all means greet them.
cxv507,"YTA, they're an invasion of her privacy for sure, you're essentially tracking her movements. I would definitely not be comfortable with that myself. It's less akin to squeeky floorboards, and more akin to hanging a bell around her neck. 

You're living together. Accept that awkward situations might arise. Get rid of the damn bells."
cxva6r,"NTA, it’s not your job. She can’t baby him forever. But maybe you should tell her more calmly, and make sure she knows all this (the ignoring texts part especially).

Edit: ignoring, not growing. Sorry"
cxvbda,NTA. He needs to accept that you can support him without knowing every beat of every song. If he wants someone like that he should have dated a fan who knew who he was before dating.
cxvd5v,"NTA - as someone who also deals with infertility and has a husband who socially smokes, when we were trying I told him to stop and he did. The brunt of fertility work is like 95% on women. It’s super frustrating when your partner can’t do the one damn thing you asked them to do while you’re monitoring every aspect of your body and getting poked and prodded with needles weekly."
cxvfnq,"To show dominance, you should take your brother hunting and to games and leave your dad at home."
cxvhgo,NTA. The crying is strange behavior. Make sure she’s OK but definitely wouldn’t want to keep these outings up. Good luck.
cxvioh,"YTA. The time to say something was just before he spent all that money. You should have said something like ""That's super cool of you, Uncle, but to be honest with school and work taking over I barely ever play my Xbox One. How about you take me out for bowling/watch a ballgame/buy me a hooker"", etc.

Wait until that Gold subscription expires, and make sure to make time to play the game with him in that time. That, or have an honest, apologetic discussion with him, from uncle to nephew."
cxvj76,NTA. I wouldn’t have let in a drunk neighbour that I barely knew into my home either. And I would definitely not have destroyed my fence for said drunk neighbour. He should have called the landlord. That’s what they do.
cxvkhm,"NTA, but personally I too find it kinda gross. Is it normalizing it?"
cxvkkr,NTA but I’d hold off on totally ghosting him.  He’s probably angry at himself for losing that time with his own father. Don’t punish him by doing the same. Time may change things.
cxvvy6,NTA. Why would you mind your own business if they can't with others private information. Plus if they did that with her they are probably gossiping about others lives too. Behavior like that shouldn't go unchecked.
cxvzwq,"NAH. You can say no to watching all the dogs on your own, but also can’t get mad that people are staying there who can watch them. Have to suck it up one way or the other."
cxw2sx,"NTA, their system is set up so that it seems like they were hell bent on refusing your money."
cxw56d,"Nothing else needed but the title. NTA. As long as you're not actively keeping her stuff from her, it's not your responsibility to get it to her"
cxw7mm,"NTA you can invite your own friends to your own baby shower. There will be loads of other people there it’s not like she’s the star of the show or guest of honor winning some grand prize.

Just another friend who’s excited for you and your baby."
cxw80l,"ESH - ""and I quickly realize I have to think up a reason""... so you weren't making a comment about your vision, you were making a shitty comment to her. Your dad and her also sound like real pieces of work... but that doesn't make you innocent."
cxwadd,"NTA Your boss was being verbally abusive and so you quit. There’s nothing wrong with that and that’s perhaps a reason his business is suffering. Besides, if that’s how he was on the first days of hiring a new person then imagine how bad it gets once he gets used to taking out his anger on you."
cxwfw4,"NTA. 

It is inconsiderate of the party planners to organize a ""family"" event during school hours."
cxwg43,"YTA.  8 am is OK. Any day of the week.  Construction needs to stay on schedule, early is better due to cooler weather."
cxwgxh,NAH you deserve space and he’s not wrong for feeling what he feels. Have you and your parents considered anything that might help him be more comfortable like a night light or something (no shame in it) or maybe discussing his feelings with him and trying to reassure him?
cxwjy4,Too many pronouns. Who is doing what in this story.
cxwm4m,NTA sounds like he was holding everyone up. You can’t block an exit like that
cxwrfw,"NTA. Her her being there that often is essentially her living there, using utilities, using space, etc.

She should pay something to contribute and help keep the place clean."
cxwsnt,"NTA. Was going to ask if rideshare was available where you are and seeing how it is, no. You don't HAVE to take him. His reaction is what really makes him TA. This is petty."
cxwu9q,"NTA. It's not about them being rich, it's about the low value they seem to place on getting things for their grandson. They need to try harder, but not necessarily more expensively."
cxwug7,"NTA, your friend is the insensitive one for trying to shame you about it. It’s not your fault your friends sister died, and you didn’t really “brag” about the vacation."
cxwyvv,"Nta, why are you even worried if you dont like the bride?"
cxwzwv,"ESH. This sort of stuff is supposed to be reported to HR, so you did the right thing. Although I get the feeling that if you didn’t want the girls job you wouldn’t have reported it, so you’re a little bit of an asshole"
cxx1lc,"NTA. I'm not a fan of people making a big deal out of my birthday either. It just comes down to personal preferences. Your s.o. likes to celebrate things like that, you don't. She should be a bit more understanding."
cxx290,"NTA

Reserving seats if you’ll be back in under 10 minutes is whatever, but an hour and a half is ridiculous. You’re fine."
cxx2lv,Yeah to be honest I give him the choice. Say sorry but this is all I have tip wise. So he can either have 0 tip or the pennies change. Then the choice is his and he can't be pissed.
cxx2nz,"You gave up on your child. There is no worse feeling than feeling abandoned by your own parents. He fucked up big time ,but he's a kid whos learning how to get by in life. For me YTA"
cxx6ff,"NAH. The school will have some liability rules about students who show up and then leave. They would be on the hook if something happened to you off school property since you technically started the day in the school building. Clear up what the policy is with them, and meet somewhere else next time. The news won’t care about this story."
cxx6kp,"NTA. Your bf needs to shut this down.  If I were you I would not be ok with it if he didn’t. A normal friendship would be ok, but the discussions of your relationship and her maliciousness in deliberately pissing you off needs to be ejected."
cxxegl,"NTA but they wont see it that way. You have shit parents. Please get out soon and take care of yourself.


and to add: embrace your tomboyish side. :)"
cxxeoy,"NTA

Husband is TA for disrespecting your time. He’s saying “my time playing is very important, your time is less important so you can stay home”"
cxxftz,"NTA and definitely reevaluate that relationship. 

You tried to get him up for dinner and he swears at you then gets mad you actually went. Did he expect you to hang around and watch him sleep?"
cxxfw3,"NTA.  If your daughter is interested, help her find her half brother.  It will help both of you bond and help her finding connection with a brother after her father left.  Don’t be bothered by your EX at this point, he made his decision to leave and hasn’t looked back, he had no place to weigh in on how you parent your daughter."
cxxh1e,"NTA, report him - hes 60 you're 16 its creepy af. In no way is he just 'being nice'; he's trying to get in your pants."
cxxqu7,NAH be prepared that this could very well be a dealbreaker for her though. If your gf feels responsible for the care of her brother you may also need to find a compromise if you stay together. Are you willing to pay for a good facility for him to live at? Maybe a live in caretaker?
cxxw81,"YTA -seems like you’re really pestering her during a stressful time. You need the favour from her, not the other way around. So respect her space and the fact that she has more important things to tend to in her life.

It seems like you’re the one bothering her to the extreme, so she may not have had any other choice really than to block you to get you to leave her alone"
cxxy4a,If you're sure the doggo isn't up to date on their vaccinations then you're NTA.
cxxzm5,YTA for trying to haggle out of a £0.50 difference.
cxy1k2,NTA-everything you said was right. Your SIL has no right to lock a door in someone else’s home and to restrict access of the occupants. That is a terrible way to treat family.
cxy4zz,"Eh, I'd say YTA lightly.

As someone from the UK, it's a really odd thing to joke about. Especially with someone you don't know well enough, and in general having sexuality as the butt of a joke isn't a good idea. I know you weren't saying anything malicious, but if the punchline is literally just ""you're gay"", that's kinda strange.

Is it something you can joke about with close friends? Absolutely, go at your heart's content. But saying it to someone you don't really know is kinda assholeish."
cxy7lt,NTA Isn't wedding dress shopping for the bride?
cxyaaf,"YWBTA. Fair enough if you don’t want to wear it but don’t sell it on - doing so seems cheap and mean. Also, you never know, there might come a time when you do wear gold."
cxyc8c,"NTA It is your shower too. Just try to clean it a little more, maybe"
cxydmk,"YWBTA if you kept the pet.  But I really do sympathize with your position and think it’s worth having a heart-to-heart conversation with your friend about whether he’s really in a position to care for the pet the way it deserves to be cared for, or whether he’d be willing to let you adopt the pet permanently.

If you make it clear he can visit the pet, etc., he might be glad to have found a loving, stable home for it"
cxyfsd,"NTA

Do not let someone you know could potentially ruin your wedding day for you attend your event. 

Just because someone is blood family doesn’t make them entitled to be in your life. It’s a privilege he has clearly lost."
cxyorj,"If you “had” to take a payday loan for a card and flowers, I feel like there’s a lot of detail we’re missing."
cxypba,"NAH if you believe that, then stick to it. Youre not hurting anyone, and you are still saying it later in the day when you can see them in person"
cxyu8i,"NTA. Your def not the asshole. You were trying to rectify a bad situation. I have to agree with you on all your ""what if"" scenerios. But,  do you do nothing?  Not an easy situation. I hope it all works out for everyone."
cxyum2,"YTA.  You chose to watch a 5 year old kid and left something fragile by him while he was unsupervised.  It's your fault it got damaged.  If the kid was older, or you put the laptop away somewhere the kid wasn't supposed you go it wouldn't be your fault."
cxywyk,Nta. You did her a giant favor and a b is enough to keep her scholarship.
cxyxmx,YTA- so wait... You KNEW about these black marks and didn't bother to mention them in the Ad or tell Alan about them? Yea...thats pretty shady.
cxyxxz,NTA- it sounds like you need to keep the baby away from him anyway he seems insufferable.
cxyyhb,YTA it wasn’t even a mean joke and if I was one of the kids who heard that I would just giggle at an old man saying “snaptube”.
cxz4f1,"NAH.

There's no telling how you feel specifically. You are your best advocate. If you genuinely feel like you might regress then just explain what's going on to the bride. I'm sure she will understand. 

On the same token, could you also be triggered knowing they are there having fun, and you didn't go because you were worried you might spiral down, which then makes you depressed... It's a vicious circle. 

There's no right or wrong answer and no one will hold anything against you except yourself. I really hope you decide to face the situation head on and kick its ass by going and having fun."
cxz9gb,"NTA, my sisters ex husband was in the Marines and cheated on her with his supervisor, she found naked photos of them together and she sent them with a letter to their higher up supervisor (my apologies, I am clueless when it comes to military ranks). They both got kicked out. 

You don't get to be a piece of shit and not have consequences."
cxzb6z,NTA- you both shook hands and agreed to a gentleman’s wager.You won the bet and at this point it is your money. if you wanna blow your nose into a sweaty bill that been pressed up against fake leather and ass all day and most likely been touched by how many peoples hands and strippers g-strings thats your own choice.
cxzc59,NTA - Your parents are terrible for spoiling her. If she did her homework first it's fine but not even doing it and just playing all day isn't good. If she keeps this up I am gravely concerned about her adulthood.
cxzfrh,"NTA

&#x200B;

Kid you need to understand that just because someone is your family you aren't entitled to give them your love, time, energy, respect, and money AT ALL. They have to EARN that. And frankly being an abusive alcoholic I would cut all ties with him."
cxzggt,"NTA you guys just might not be compatible. You might want to have a conversation about compromise. If he’s not willing, He’s not the man for you."
cxzivx,"YTA, or rather YWBTA. It's sunk cost at this point, let it go. If he decides to come back next weekend to see you, consider it paid that way.

You know, for wanting to see a friend you seemed to make a big fuss about the gas money. It just makes you look petty in the end to keep bringing it up and then asking for it back."
cxzk2r,NTA. He *is* a whiny butt baby. This entitled behavior is so exhausting
cxzklj,"NTA. 

You paid for the clothes. She didn’t. Take the clothes back and tell her fuck off until she pays you back."
cxzpgo,"uhh...YTA if you don’t. not only is Hotdog uncomfortable AND in a relationship, Rose’s bf deserves to know, and she won’t tell him herself"
cxzq46,"NAH, did you send your sister an invitation specifying the event was child free when everyone else got one? Or did she not get an invitation because she couldn’t come?"
cxzqxm,You probably should go but NAH. This is a pretty normal situation to be granted time off work for. It will also probably mean something to other members of your family including your mom.
cxztul,"YTA

Not in a cruel way, but all of your resistence is simply emotional. It's about all of these potentials that exist in your head. When you restrict someone from independent action, especially if it's due only to a potential in your head, it is a trapped feeling. It's unreasonable.

I don't think you're wrong to want to spend more time together, but what would you be doing at those hours anyways? You don't need to answer that, just think of the reality.

YTA because this is your issue."
cxzucm,"NTA,  I don't think your other 2 dogs will care, so why does your SO?"
cxzvom,"NTA, but what a mess. Can you do an update to your original FaceBook post (without the video) and explain the situation, in the hope that your post will be shared in your community?

Hope someone else here can give you better suggestions."
cxzx90,NTA. no one likes a backseat driver. Their behavior could result in a car accident as well.
cxzyln,NTA Kinda sounds like a very light form of animal abuse. I imagine your cats live with more stress than they would otherwise in a calmer household that respects them.
cy01u9,"YTA because of your daughter's age.  She's 7 and she's interested in something and wants you to be a part of her interest.  Depending on her other hobbies, this could be more than just ""will you geocache with me"" and could be something like ""is my parent actually interested in my life?""

You say your husband is probably biased--so are you.  ""Boring and tedious""?  Welcome to being a parent.  Your daughter isn't at an age where she's going to consider how fun something is for her parents.  She wants to do something and wants you to be a part of it.  You don't want to because it's 'boring and tedious.""

Sometimes you just need to do something with your kid and let them figure out how much fun it actually is."
cy02un,They started eating without finding you a place? How shitty. NTA
cy04iq,"YTA if she clearly doesn’t want to wear what you want her to. It’s her choice, leave her be"
cy051b,"NTA — After five instances it’s time to tell your friend that you’ve done more than your share, but this is over. 

I think you might want to end the friendship too. She doesn’t respect you or your valuable time, let alone your friendship.. so I don’t know why you wouldn’t."
cy07gj,"No, just no. You can't manage your money, your parents just gave you a loan, you're talking about spending money from a raise and promotion you don't even have yet, and you want to go back into debt to send your parents on an expensive cruise that no one in your family can afford???

YTA

The best gift you can give your parents is showing them that you can live within your means, debt free, and with a healthy emergency fund."
cy08j1,NAH but keep in mind that people are highly unlikely to remember the word you said before their ears perk up to the phrase “master race”.
cy0br4,"NTA

Question. Have you explained to your bf about your feelings and thoughts about it all? Feel like you should if you haven't already."
cy0ckg,"NTA at all that's rude af. You don't exclude your brother's girlfriend of FOUR YEARS. 

>My boyfriend wants me to go to the ceremony for him.

Really?? Why isn't he insisting you be invited to the reception? Honestly this would be a either we both go or none of us go situation for me and I'm surprised he's expecting you to still go to this ceremony. He should be sticking up for your relationship."
cy0ntt,[deleted]
cy0ry5,"NTA 

She's being hostile and accusatory. You're in no way an asshole for avoiding the conflict."
cy0v93,"NTA.  I think it’s funny he just stole your account and then just had other accounts anyway. I definitely wouldn’t transfer anything,"
cy0vf2,"NTA

She batrayed your trust, that's the real reason you ended your friendship with her.   

And really, you get to decide who you want in your life.  Cutting out someone who hurt you doesn't make you an asshole.   It's entirely your choice."
cy0vug,"NTA 

You could have handled it better. You’re 17, use your words and tell him that he’s being rude and he needs to stop. 

Or you know, give him a wedgie and call him a poop face. 

Either way, I think someone needs to get a handle on their shitty kid and you need to not let a 14 year old bully bother you"
cy0yh9,">Because this is slightly relevant, everyone in this story is Black, including myself

Just in case this becomes an issue, I bring up that we are Black because immigration and deportation are not common discussions in the Black community as it would be in other communities. I grew up on the Latino side of a predominantly White town. So I have seen fathers, mothers and children suddenly disappear. My mother, a teacher, had to get training on how to deal with ICE and how to help her students in case a situation similar to Brenda's were to occur. She passed that information on to her children. No one else in the chat knew anything about immigration or what resources there were."
cy12ke,"NTA. She said she would do it for free, otherwise you would have stayed. Really tacky on her to demand payment after offering to do something for free"
cy135u,"NAH, especially since he’s not mad. Why doesn’t he come along for a few days and then you finish the trip alone?"
cy15dx,NTA. You don't owe anyone anything. Do whats right for you. There's no sense in going just to have a bad time and be in a bad mood anyway.
cy1650,"NTA, but this sounds like a good one to crosspost to r/legaladvice to figure out how to cover yourself from retribution. Definitely think you did the right thing by reporting."
cy16gg,"NAH but banging on the wall isn't going to help anything. Have you tried to talk to the hotel management about getting a new room? They want to keep you happy and will accommodate if they can. Kids are kids and the parents can't control them, especially if they're still babies/toddlers, which it sounds like they are. I'm sure the parents want the kids to be quiet even more than you do."
cy17vk,This situation sounds way more complicated than can be expressed in 3000 characters. But I hope everything works out for everyone involved.
cy1das,"YTA. 

First you decided that people who are open about sex and have tattoos aren’t “church people” 

Then you poked fun at her religion. 

Just don’t do that. 

Whether or not it’s your religion, and whether or not that religion has lots of members, you shouldn’t be poking fun (even in light hearted ways) at someone’s beliefs."
cy1ff1,"Sounds like a sketchy situation for her to be honest, but at some point people do need to take responsibility for their own lives. That said, I’d recommend going - the guy might turn out to be great and you might all have a good time! Other thing to mention is don’t take for granted being a man. Put yourself in her shoes, she might well like this guy, but also wants to be safe. What else is she going to do? As a guy I know I often take for granted how much more secure I am than if I was female- the situation your flat mate mentioned. If the genders were reversed there would be no risk at all. All in all, NAH - but maybe go to be nice. Especially if she isn’t doing this all the time."
cy1fnk,NTA I've been in the same situation. Although if you did go on to date her you would be breaking the bro code
cy1g8y,"NTA , this is harassment . He’s purposely blocking your way into the building and also constantly tries to annoy you on purpose for his own joy. It seems like he’s done this to you several times and that’s not okay. He got what he deserved and hopefully leaves you alone now."
cy1k12,NTA. I think you told her quite nicely why you weren't able to come and any reasonable person would understand.  See what they reply and then work from there
cy1m44,"If you're serious about the sport, you need to find some way to deal with having to wrestle girls, OP.

[Last year some kid forfeited a state championship so he wouldn't have to wrestle a girl, and blamed it on his ""Christian values"".](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/03/01/rather-than-wrestle-girl-state-championship-this-high-schooler-forfeited/)"
cy1pl0,"NTA , five years old is more than old enough to handle going into a bathroom by themselves. Especially given that you observed every possible alternative, I’d say that that was good parenting, and I don’t know why this woman is inadvertently stifling your daughters chance at being somewhat independent (that may be a bit of a stretch)"
cy1rch,"She can do whatever she would like to but when I was 18 I wanted a hand tattoo, walked into the shop and the artist declined to do it because he didn't want to see a young girl miss out on jobs because of this decision.

I never went through with it and I am thankful he declined. Sometimes it takes a stranger to say it. 

Anyway, I don't blame you for being wary of the idea but you've expressed your concerns and there's not much you can do about it other than be upset if she goes through with it. NTA"
cy1yea,"NTA - but I would definitely have made some passive-aggressive comment like, “dude it’s so nice to meet you too! I just moved in a week ago. I’m really looking forward to getting to know my neighbors! Thanks for coming over and introducing yourself!”"
cy2574,"NTA

But can I play devil's advocate and ask if you think maybe this is her way of trying to bond because she hasn't been very accepting up until now? Or do you think this is just a way for her to try and control you?"
cy266v,"NTA- if you guys split it in half, he got $150 worth of a present. And you had no obligation to GIVE him anything. Tell him he's an ass"
cy2a5g,"NTA. He probably thought that letting you stay with him was a big enough favor that you owed it to him to keep quiet, but that’s some serious shit, man. Cheating on someone is one thing, cheating on someone you have a child with and live with is another thing. Personally, I would have never been able to live with myself if I was in your position and I lied to her.

He had to have known that shit was gonna come crashing down eventually. Shitty situation, you lost a friend, that sucks, but you’re all gonna be better off, and he got what he deserved."
cy2bdh,Nta: where was the sitting down and talking when she got it?
cy2eh4,"ESH. You're 17 and she is 12, so you should reflect that in your behavior and not take it so personally. Be the bigger person if you can. Fighting fire with fire will just make things worse. On the other hand she does sound pretty terrible. Where are your parents during all this? Sounds like they need to be stepping in here."
cy2fco,NTA- you deserve a new one since that’s what she ruined
cy2if0,"NTA. But thank you for the typo “pooped the question.”

No one should poop the question."
cy2m00,"NAH - people were already there and helping.  If he needed CPR they would have been yelling about him not breathing, asking if anyone knew it, etc.  More people standing around does not help.  You were fine.  BF can take a CPR class if he's that upset and he can be prepared to help in the future should the situation arise."
cy2mrd,"NAH. Just treat him like you would anyone else. If a fully visually capable classmate bothered you with nail biting, would you say something? Just be kind and and let him know it aggravates your anxiety."
cy2na3,"NTA, he sounds like a jerk. If he wants to help you, he doesn't have to put you down or poke you where you're sensitive; there are definitely more productive ways to ""encourage \[you\] to better \[yourself\]."" Sounds like he's getting defensive about it."
cy2ndh,NTA. They are inconsiderate assholes and you solved the problem in a civilized way.
cy2pii,"NTA. 

You politely turned her down many times, and she still persisted. At that point she’s harassing you."
cy2s2m,"NTA- You're not the asshole however this is a situation between your parents and your friend's moms.

You parents just need to get the money from your friends mom and then y'all need to cut all of them out of y'alls lives."
cy2wd8,YTA he made a joke and you took it like he talked shit about you?? fuck MY feelings got hurt and i’m not even in the relationship
cy2x7q,"NTA You are basically renting the car to her, its only natural that you would have a way to take back the car no matter what MIL does (like losing her keys). Obviously you cant use those keys unless you are taking the car back."
cy2y00,"NAH 

He probably doesn’t correlate makeup with your insecurities. He only sees that it’s something getting on his clothes. 

Try using a really good setting spray. Ones by urban decay, mac, or smashbox all work quite well. 

In the end it’s something the two of you will have to compromise on somehow. But you’re not an asshole for wearing makeup and he’s not an asshole for preferring you without it."
cy2z4a,"NTA, she used you all, she played games with you all by spreading lies. She deserves what she gets. And you can't reason with someone being like that. 

Now that you and all your coworkers cut her from the group. It would be the adult thing to do is forget her and not talk about her. It is immature and petty to make fun of her. And work should not dismiss the instant messages. Inside or outside of work it is harassment, usually company policies include both scenarios. By them turning their backs on her can open up a lawsuit against your friends and work place. Because it can be brought in to work by anybody and cause a hostile work environment and reduce moral. Just be careful and try not to be part of it"
cy3067,"YTA what the hell, dude? Your daughter bought you a gift she thought you would like. Really hope this is a shitpost."
cy31u8,NTA. Seems reasonable. Your house your rules.
cy323g,"NTA.

They may think of you as one, but you aren’t. Call the cops, tell them they are actively buying/selling drugs. A minute later, text your friend(s) to get rid of them. Say it incredibly serious and like something is up, so they don’t think you are just telling them to. If they don’t, then so be it. If they tell the boss, the boss may or may not believe them.

When the cops get there, if they don’t find anything right away, they might just continue their search in other areas, like trash cans.

Again, NTA."
cy377a,NTA. You weren’t intentionally trying to change you. You spoke what you believed and he agreed with you. If it were the other way around they’d have no issue whatsoever.
cy393x,NTA. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for wanting/needing some alone time. Do what is best for your mental health.
cy3bdf,NTA. You're paying for other stuff and doing more work to maintain the apartment. I think you're fine on this one.
cy3cfv,"Obviously NTA. 

They would need to be a complete piece of shit to try to make you feel guilty for trying to raise funds to pay your hospital bills. Seriously. 

Buying a second hand car is not a lavish expense either."
cy3di8,"NTA. First of all, she went behind your back to get your phone number from someone else after you said no?! That is already a huge overstep and not okay. Continuing to harass you after you've repeatedly declined her advances is not okay. 

No. Means. No. End of story.

If this girl is getting made for her inappropriate behavior, that's on her and the people bullying her. You did not contribute to the behavior that led to the bullying and you did not participate in the bullying. You did nothing wrong."
cy3g3h,"NTA, who knows what they’ll do but its worth it to report and let them look into."
cy3hij,"YTA because you're teaching your son that you'll pay him off when he acts up in a way that makes your wife or you uncomfortable. And also YTA because it seems that he may have some conflicted feelings about the circumcision, and at 15 now is the time that he should be able to talk about this (in a calm, informational way) to understand it, and to give him a chance to think about whether he would want a son of his circumcised. 

TL/DR: I think you are doubly sending the wrong message, ""shut up you're making us uncomfortable about a subject we don't want to talk about"" and ""if you make enough of a fuss you can get me to pay you to shut up""."
cy3l17,"Nta

Chef tax"
cy3m85,"So it's not ok when he does it, but when you're in the mood it's ok? YTA"
cy3mny,"NAH. She sounds off her rocker but I don’t think you reporting her will “force her to get help.” You’ll just sound bitter and she can spin it that way if she wants. I doubt reporting her will really do anything, tbh."
cy3mve,NTA; it's correct and reasonable and your husband comes off as callous. What is it that makes him think that being half-siblings means they're not on the same team? Does he ever refer to your boys as his step-sons or only as his sons? Does he insist they call him dad?
cy3nkv,NTA - your are the level of petty I aim for.
cy3phm,"NTA. When he's older you can say things like ""Yeah and for like 6 months you also thought you were a werewolf"""
cy3psb,"NTA; if you don't want him there, don't invite him. You're entitled to a social life and engagements outside of your relationship.

The fact that he invites you to his events is immaterial. It's nice of him to do, but you didn't ask for it nor sign up for it being a quid pro quo type of situation. If he doesn't agree, next time he has his favorite snack, offer him something particularly disgusting. He'll say no, of course. Now you point out he's obligated to offer his food to you, since you offered your food to him. Same deal here."
cy3q23,NTA. Hearing someone just constantly bitch about themselves and their perceived flaws can be frustrating. Just ignore it from now on and continue to be an attentive friend otherwise.
cy3ro5,NAH - obedience training is expensive and i understand that your husband might feel a little over protective because your dog is just a puppy. You aren’t an asshole for simply just wanting your dog to get some training and not wanting to put all the weight of training on your self.
cy3t8h,"NTA - has bridezilla-ing really come to this?  You invite adults, you make respectful requests of them, you do not assume control over their personal property like they’re being booked into county lockup. 

How this woman found a gown to hide balls this size, I will never know."
cy3zs9,YTA. Let your sister have a friend for god’s sake
cy42pa,ESH. But holy this post was a roller coaster..
cy43ju,[deleted]
cy4512,"NAH. I think it's great you found a place to live and it sounds like your girlfriend is trying to be understanding. I also can get where she's coming from. I don't agree with it personally but as long as she's not trying to stop you from living there, she can feel hurt."
cy46tt,"NTA: I've had roommates who DONT lock the door at all. They leave and come as they please. Their defense was that someone was always home so they didnt feel like they needed to lock it/would be stepping out for an errand and thought it was okay. Always lock the damn door because your safety and everyone else's is put at a risk should anything happen. Someone can also choose to make a copy of your keys if they wanted to. Take the keys and place it inside. When your roommate calls, you call tell her ""sorry, I saw you left the keys outside and didnt want anyone to enter while I left. I'll be home in X amount of time. Or you can ask the property manager for a spare"". Being forgetful doesnt excuse her for basically putting yall at a risk for being robbed."
cy47bw,YTA. It's not a ridiculous request. She has an artist to do it for you. You are her maid of honor. Suck it up.
cy4b8g,ESH for thinking this is a good game to build relationships but NAH for the actual event
cy4dr8,NAH without the cashier's side of the story we have no way to tell.  There are so many things that could be involved in why that happened
cy4fgw,"Sigh.
You're a good example of why adults being unable to write is a problem, because you're so literate I feel like this has to be a shit post

Listen. Don't tell her not to be a furry, but you can tell her she's being inconsiderate of people with her crafts and that it's not okay. You should also be looking out for any adults trying to use it to get closer to her."
cy4j0i,YTA. Report issues like this! That's some health violation nonsense and putting your customers at risk. It would suck for her to be there but letting her take the promotion without saying anything will just be rewarding her gross behavior.
cy4t2r,Nta. You lay you pay...he knew the risks. Now he is seeing the result. Actions have consequences. Sometimes good and sometimes bad. I however feel he should be more worried about the tiny human he credit over the monetary issues.
cy4tlj,"NTA at all. This is some disgusting behavior, please save Joe from this. Heartbreak by a cheater forever changes a person. The pain is terrible, the violation forever makes you a less trusting and less loving person. Even if he did fall in a love again it wouldn’t be the same.

Telling him now, it won’t be as bad as if he finds out when he’s already married her.  Tell him anonymously if you have to, just get him the info before he marries a terrible person."
cy4u6u,"NTA 
          They wanted to know why he went in there, used that as an excuse to snoop through your things. You're an adult and it's your room. Keep your things wherever you want to. They're the assholes."

cy4z93,It sounds like they won’t come anyway
cy4zfz,"YTA. My God, why would you do that to her?"
cy517z,"Don't care who's the arsehole so much as just want to let you know that in Australia, this is sometimes referred to as ""koala ears""."
cy51xf,"YTA. You took way too long to decide and you said you'd go. The day before is too late to bail on it. I fully understand your difficulty, but you should have done something before now."

cy556i,NTA. I hope you’re not living together because you’re separated and ready to divorce soon.
cy5axb,"NTA - If it’s minor debt they should’ve planned better. If it’s major medical debt it’ll just suck you under too - what they need to do is declare bankruptcy.  

Don’t ever let family members try to guilt you into giving them money. You have to look out for yourself."
cy5cck,YTA. the fact that you won't type out the exact joke you said says everything.
cy5dlg,"NAH

They dont have dibs on the name."
cy5dlo,"NAH, you aren't lonely, it doesn't seem to bother you, and you aren't hurting anyone. You do you."
cy5nga,"YTA, I understand how you feel annoyed with him, but he’s a human being. You guys were his friends. He doesn’t know what he did wrong and all you guys just left him in the dark. You have to at least try to explain it to him nicely, otherwise you’re the jerk for just abandoning him. And how else would he know what he’s doing wrong because maybe he can improve himself for future friendships. I know it’s hard, but you have to at least say something to him, then you wouldn’t be an asshole."
cy5odi,NTA - He clearly has no idea what he really wants and is just jumping from idea to idea. Whereas you have wanted this for a while and definitely won't regret it. This could also cause relationship issues between your boyfriend and his mother as you mentioned she is against tattoos.
cy5rxs,Yeah this makes sense.  Your sister gets that the point is to spend time with him doing things he’d like to do.
cy5szy,"NTA. Nobody expected it to be so valuable and now they wanna be pissy.

Put it in your kids name, immediately until they back the fuck off."
cy5y3m,ESH. Y’all are childish
cy5znb,I’ve filled out numerous job applications and just quite simply haven’t been hired yet. I’ve never once brought up the possibility of lying about a disability I don’t have. My PTSD and anxiety isn’t goin to hold me back from getting a job.
cy62cm,"NTA 
You are an adult, you keep it away from your sister and do it on your own time, so I don’t see an issue. It seems like your mom has more issues than vaping if that’s all it takes for her to forbid you from seeing your sister. 

Do what you want, we only get to enjoy life once, boomers will be mad but, oh well."
cy6405,"If was you I would just put this decision on HR now

I've seen many a manager and supervisor hung out to dry by falling foul of the global policy in flexible working, I was the gallows man on many of those occasions 

NAH until you're clear on what policy is 

E.g. In the UK if I did this I'd be screwed if that person had kids and I didn't have a cast iron case as to why I couldn't accommodate their needs (which is a good thing as it helps more parents work) 

Cover your back and run it via HR, you have refusal to answer a management request at least in your favour, as kids don't negate that being a potential discipline issue"
cy654x,YTA - memory issues are frustrating enough without people getting angry about it
cy661k,"NTA. Your sister was inconsiderate for bringing him into the room and talking for 20 minutes. She could have left with the makeup bag and talked to him elsewhere. It may be her room too, but that doesn't give her the right to be obnoxious."
cy69q4,"As it stands, NAH, but ask your bride.  Marriage is about compromises though,  it's not like she can make her brother a bride's maid.    Do you have siblings that are a part of her wedding party?"
cy6bq2,ESH. That poor dog.
cy6d6n,"NTA personally, as someone with ADHD, it can be difficult to focus as a normal person would, especially in conversation. I often am staring off into the distance while listening to family and friends, and that can make it seem like I am not interested in what they have to say. This has frustrated people, and sometimes it's just impossible not to. Simply asking for him not to do specific things like interrupting or playing loud music on his phone is not out of line at all."
cy6es7,"YTA, sorry that your experiences with drugs haven’t been good. But weed is objectively pretty harmless anyway. Plus, those are her things. You mind if I go through your room and throw out whatever I disagree with?"
cy6ii7,ESH also just because your sister grieves different than you doesn't mean she isn't hurting

cy6xcr,"Good god NTA. Run far far far far away and please seek therapy so you can learn the best way to process this stuff—you and your sister deserve to be able to put this behind you and move on with your lives. Your brothers sound like they have their own issues to deal with if they know what she’s done and still support her. 

And it is not assholish to cut toxic people out of your life. Your mental, physical, and emotional heath comes first. I’m sorry you’ve gone through so many awful things and I hope things improve your you and your sister soon."
cy713m,"Yes, YTA. It's a guide dog, you know, for someone who has impaired vision, so they can be/feel independant. did you tell your Dad that the in-laws were there or do they live with you? And lastly, get some allergy meds for future occassions so you can ALL enjoy family celebrations.

And I don't think the dog is the issue."
cy72mp,"NAH, cheating is bad, but that’s not what this is about. This is a loan, you should just pay it back and forget this fool ever existed imo.

If you can get a loan else where, with low interest, I’d just pay him off ASAP and just move on, you deserve a better way to spend your life and time.

If you don’t have the money and can’t get another loan, then you just have to ask him for an extension. No other options really that I can see."
cy733a,"NTA free medical care isnt your job. 

If he pays and you refuse. You have the right to refuse business."
cy78wi,NTA. You own your own privacy
cy7bhs,"YTA. Your dog has known this environment for was I presume to be the majority of its life. Also, depending on what type of relatioship it has with the other dog, your dog could potentially show signs of depression. Taking an animal out of its environment needlessly is never a good idea."
cy7fgw,"NTA- even though you can afford to not get paid in this situation, he needs to be taught a lesson in my opinion. What if someone did work for them and they couldn’t afford to not get paid! It’s not cool to take advantage of people, boosting his business while not paying for work received its practically stealing. Considering he didn’t actually pay you for implementing the software he was no rights or ownership to it! Good on you, maybe it’ll teach him to not take advantage of people and be a huge asshat!"
cy7itg,NAH - But remember perspective is huge here. She may take the dildo as “use this cause I’m not interested.” Make sure you make it clear that the toy is supposed to be fun for both of you to use together. If she’s totally not into it then I’d just express the miscommunication and not push it further.
cy7ks0,"NAH- you don’t owe anyone anything, but just remember that this is a person that will be ostracized and excluded for the rest of their life and a little kindness goes a long way. What if you told them you don’t like to hug, but make up a secret handshake with them so they feel special and you can avoid always having to turn down a hug and feeling like a jerk.

Edit: changed NOH to NAH"
cy7xi6,"NTA,  cut him off for a while

He needs to man up and work his shit out

It’s pretty ironic that he’s into Alex Jones, who I thought was anti government, but he collects welfare. 

He’s a giant hypocrite, I’m(upper middle class) paying taxes that go to his broke ass, and then he’s voting in an orange man who want to kick me out. Lol wtf."
cy80h7,NTA even though weed is indeed relatively harmless if something goes wrong you need to know what is in your system. Thinking this kind of thing is funny is not cute.
cy898x,"NTA
It's not your job to handle anyone's problems 
I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to tell her.
There is a difference between venting to a friend and making them your personal therapist. You're putting your own mental health at risk by listening to her. She might be a close friend but that's where you need to draw the line

It might be miscommunication that lead her to believe it was okay to do that. I think sending her a text or a voice mail would be better than in person. So you can write everything you need and your explanation without being in the spot and caving in bc you love her or her interrupting you."
cy89je,"Yeah, you're an asshole for not letting some dude dunk his nuts in your wife's face while trying to jump over her, lol.

No, you aren't the a-hole here, dude lol. Pretty open and shut case to me. NTA."
cy8au6,"NTA. You should not be supporting them. Get them out ASAP. The longer they stay the harder it will be to get them out and the more damaging to your relationship with your brother it will be. Spoken from experience. Let someone move in with me while they ""got back on their feet"" 3 years later finally got him out and haven't spoken to him since, nor will I speak to him again."
cy8bfw,"I mean, yeah. YTA. You’re being really super clingy and making a non-issue into an issue. She’s trying to be as kind as she can but it’s obvious she’s trying not to mix her personal life with her business life. I’m sure you miss her and everything, but relax a bit, bud. Don’t be That Guy."
cy8cdr,"NTA.

Father's Day isn't ""Drop everything they've ever done to you and treat them like a king"" day.

Yeah, I wouldn't even bother reaching out to him on ANY Father's Day from here on out - you have better things to do. Your mom is also an asshole for what she said. Just because you're angry doesn't mean you get to be rude like that, especially to your kid of all people."

Not your problem."
cy8oje,"YTA. Look, this is gonna catch up to you at some point. She is clearly adamant about getting in contact with you and ignoring it is not gonna make it go away. Man the fuck up and take some responsibility for your actions. The main reason I'm calling you the asshole is because of ""I was extremely distraught that she could go through with this without my permission."" Like, dude, are you from a country where women have no voice? Incredibly fucked up thing to think."
cy8rkc,"NTA, but please don't bring her to your family.
Your brother should tell her that he's not interested otherwise,  he ita."
cy968j,"NTA her bf sounds very controlling. It's crazy that you were even able to speak to him that way.  It's also really shitty of her to push you away because of him, but that's also a huge red flag.

cy9i2j,"YTA

You are not the only person paying for this joint gift. Other people’s opinions matter just as much as yours.

You belittled someone else’s idea. 

You need to learn to disagree politely. You should have stated your case for the gift you prefer without being disrespectful, put it to a vote and then be a gracious winner/loser."
cy9ipn,NTA. Disappointing other people is an essential life skill.
cy9jf6,NTA and I'm sorry that everything is a source of major conflict. Sounds like it's going to be a miserable year for everyone. Is it possible for her to find another living situation?
cy9knc,I feel dumber for having read this.
cy9s9i,"NTA. I was in the same situation as you, until I began to charge for my time. Obviously, most people stopped coming for help, but the ones remaining pay. So less hassle, more money.

It's your time man, it's not assholery to take care of how do we use it."
cy9sst,"ESH. Your brother for obvious reasons. You for the passive aggressive snide remarks immediately when he walked in the room. You don't live there anymore, its not really your place to call out your brother like that. Your mom also sucks for allowing him to walk all over her and be a freeloader. 

Your opinion of your brother doesn't make you the asshole here, let me be clear. But this is an issue between him and your mom. In my opinion if they already know how you feel then continuing to tell him off everytime you see him makes you the ass. You won't change your mom's actions or his, so all you are doing is making them not want to invite you over to avoid you starting drama again."
cy9suu,YTA - you don’t write in someone else’s diary without their permission.  Your intentions may have been good but not your actions.
cy9tpv,"NTA

When I was a junior, I helped co-found my schools debate team. The advisor was adamant that we had to have a big, public debate by May to get sign-ups before next year. There were only 4 members, so it would've been a lot of work (venue, topic, advertising it).

I told her let's shoot for June because I had SATs and AP tests (and band, too). She would not budge. And she said that I have to prioritize. I told her that I *am* and my SATs and AP tests come first. I quit the club over this.

Anyways, I totally understand how you're feeling. School clubs can be difficult to negotiate. And it's absurd to me that they would actually *charge money* for missing meetings. And then be just totally unable to get their act (not pun intended) together and choose dates, times, places.

I think general rule of thumb: don't agree with *any* school club to pay those kinds of fees/fines. The only ones you should be paying are material costs, or the cost for voluntary extras like trips."
cya1bm,"ESH. Don't deprive your niece of an ~~auntie~~ uncle because you and your sister don't get along. You're adults, and you should be able to be cordial for a few hours during a family get-together.

cya2j2,"NTA - a lot of comments clearly don't know the app, and maybe you could have given more information - the friend section of it is female only, asks a lot of profile questions including relationship status, and is completely separate from the dating function.

You’re obviously louder than you realize. Quiet down. Get loud when they’re gone.

cyab8y,NTA. Sounds like the in laws are better at school age children.
cyac7p,"YTA If your son is happy and comfortable with one friend, or just a couple, and doesn't have a big drive to go to parties, just accept him.

I know *you* want him to experience parties and girlfriends and whatever, but this isn't about you. This is about him. Some people are latebloomers and that's ok.

It can be damaging to pressure him to make friends and girlfriends, because that's often out of his control (he can't *force* anyone to like him or share his interests). So you're making him feel like a failure if he's rejected.

I didn't start dating or having a lot of friends until 18+. I don't regret missing parties or anything like that, because I did stuff that made me happy (I'm a nerd, so it was going to a bookstore). And the friends I made outside of HS were far better than the majority of the friends I made in HS, besides for the 2-3 that I felt were my true friends."
cyadgx,"NAH. I'll probably be downvoted for this, but I can actually understand her feeling a bit heartbroken that she's scrimped and saved for a gift and now his stepmom's bought him something that sounds fairly expensive, and so impressive that it will leave hers in the dust. I don't think you need to wait until October, and you certainly don't have to get him another gift, but just to compromise, could you tell your stepson that you'll give it to him the day after his birthday?"
cyaflh,"NTA but you should do this in person and take the costumes immediately. If you ask her over text for example, I'm sure there's gonna be an issue of the costumes being ""lost"" or her not getting back to you. Drop by, tell her you will be needing your costumes so you're going to take them home with you now, and refuse to leave without them."
cyag2x,"In my eyes, since you're not a business and you let him inspect before buying it you haven't done anything wrong. To ease your mind I hope he's only trying to haggle getting money back. NTA  but for your sake maybe you should respond once and then if he persists involve the authorities."
cyag6q,"NTA, honestly employers know how to classify employees and do this to save themselves money. you are definitely not 1099.  They should have paid employer taxes and you should be a w2 employee. bottom line"

cyann7,"NTA. Essentially she clearly defined that shes going to be moving on from you, physically and emotionally.

You don't get to dump someone and then conveniently go back to them when things aren't swell for you.

And hey-you listened when she told you, as you promised. You just didn't comfort her, which to be fair to you you never said anything about.

To all the others saying YTA because her pet died and you should be more emphatic- well, maybe you are emphatic but you have nothing to say. Its not a humanitarian crisis, pets die, and people pass away.

Does she not realise you can make new friends without having to breakup with old friends? People move away all the damn time. In this day and age its hard 'not' to stay in touch.

You were not good enough for her. Your friends were not good enough for her. She doesn't want to be associated with you guys. She sucks. And now her pet died who does she expect to comfort her?

Why not go cry with her new friends who are more on her wavelength that 'shares her values' and at 'her same spot?'"

You don’t have to make a change, but he’s right that to meet your long term goals, you’ll need to find somewhere affordable and comfortable for both of you. 

Make a list of four places you would be okay with moving where he could transfer. List out pros and cons. Do it together. 

And check in with your counselor about all of this. Big life change is hard for most people, but it does sound like this could be a positive change."
cybjom,"Yeah, YTA. People need to vent. I know it’s sometimes shitty feeling like you’re the only one that people have publicly aired grievances with, but that does not make it okay to just go scorched earth."
cyblzv,"NTA. You're right, your schizophrenic hallucinations **would make you a danger on the road**. I think your family need to be more understanding of your perfectly sentient reasoning and legal reasons, as to why you **can't** learn. Also, in some jurisdictions, it's actually illegal to drive with severe mental impairments. You're also getting along perfectly fine without a licence, relying on public transportation and walking."
cybno3,"YTA. 

Her dating life really isn’t any of your business and even if it was, your vote of confidence by saying she’s gonna be single for the rest of her life isn’t really motivational by any means."

cycpyf,"NOT AN ASSHOLE. Not at all, she’s come into your home, overstayer her welcome, used and abused your personal items, taken advantage of your mother’s kindness and it sound as though she is now just using your family as a free stay.  

Does she have a job? Does she pay rent? These are the kind of things to factor in and if she doesn’t I’d say start treating the situation as if she were a tenant. Ask her for proof that she’s looking for another place to live and actively searching for a job and if she isn’t help her. 

For now though I’d say she needs a wake up so reprimand the shit out of her. Your mum put you in charge and as such use said authority to lay down down fucking rules."
cycrh5,"NTA. Thankfully in Europe people don't need to rely on tips to survive, so it's your own choice whether to give money or not. Plus it's inconvenient to have to keep cash around just for that, if the app doesn't support tips."

In the mean time I highly recommend trying to run some photo recovery software on your phone. The DiskDigger app for Android or the Recuva program on PC both work very well in my experience. If it's an apple phone I'm not as experienced with those to recommend any software."
cycvw3,"NTA - your mother sounds like she REALLY needs a therapist because cutting you off from her entire side of the family due to a divorce she decided on is NOT a product of a healthy mind. 

If you are in the USA and a child I can't see how any part of any divorce forces you to have to consult her about anything. Your mother sounds VERY controlling and honestly does not sound like a good person. I would say why sacrifice a relationship with an entire side of your family due to the childish demands of a over-grown infant."
cyd08u,NAH simple misunderstanding. You didn't have the money and wanted to borrow it and she wanted to give you a gift.

cyd2w9,"NTA whilst you probably should put the vacuum away, he could have done it as well and it would have cost him the same amount of energy it costed him to come and tell you. If it’s true that you’re the one that’s always cleaning up the common area it really does become nitpicking for him to tell you that you’re not doing a good enough job. It’s like you’re cleaning the house and he’s following you around just to tell “Oh you missed a spot”. I’d say he still has a way to sweet of a deal if all he has to do is clean up the vacuum once you’re done."
cyd5k6,Yta. Some people are truly like that. Its like a tick or OCD thing. I am not a 5 or 0 person but I have the same issue. It has to end in even numbers. It makes me cringe if its not. I will literally start ticking..
cyd6zr,NAH. Your wife has a serious problem. She is TA if she’s not actively seeking help.
cyd7a1,NTA. I don’t think parents should force their kids to go to church.
cydcv4,"NTA, your solution is excellent, I would have done exactly the same (I hate manual labour, though I'm good at many other things).

It's not as if you are not helping out your parents, you are just prioritizing your time, while still getting the job done.

Ask your parents if they would prefer the work done, or if they'd rather impart moral lessons on you, their adult child."
cydfno,"NAH, to me it just looks like both of you misinterpreted each others acts and words."

It looks like some of the resentment is not just that he has more freedom, but that his extra freedom is taking up your time and resources, making you less free."
cydpla,NAH. Just text them a reminder with your Venmo name.
cydrb0,NAH but worrying about her cheating is insulting becaue you're saying she's the type of person that could easily be swayed into that behavior.  You've got to show more trust or this won't end well for you.

cye4k8,"NAH

It’s a new relationship, maybe even the first, and your friend is excited to share with you. Be happy with her and focus on new beginnings. 

Telling her not to share though could close her off and make her feel like she can’t tell you anything or she’ll upset you."
cye5mi,"NTA because of her unwillingness to even have meetings to discuss anything about the house. When you have roommates sometimes you need to have meetings and she seems to just be avoiding them, not actually busy. 

Honestly, the upgrade was made without anyone’s knowledge. How was she supposed to know her dingy basement room would become nicer? She couldn’t have. I’d be a little upset too if suddenly you wanted me to pay more for something I literally had no say in. 

But I see your side too, which is is why I almost voted for none here. It just rubs me the wrong way she’s going out of her way to not talk to you guys about it."
cye5pv,"NTA for telling customers what really happens with their food. 

Forget about that mom with kids. I know it’s mean, but forget her. She can find another waitress job.

cyeegw,NTA  I'm sure the company has a policy that they're not responsible for cars getting broken into.
cyegts,"NTA. I'm gay, and my partner uses they/them pronouns. The point of pronouns is respecting people's choice to decide which pronouns define them. Refusing to use he/him pronouns for you is refusing to use the pronouns you identify with, which makes him TA."
cyekzw,"Not true. The item is ""not as described,"" which in Etsy's eyes trumps the sellers no returns policy. Open a case that they defrauded you by selling a non-vintage item as vintage.

IME it is pretty standard for US landlords to handle maintenance issues like this - they tell you in advance when the workmen will be coming so you can make any adjustments but they don't expect you to be home.  Bug control counts as a maintenance issues.  I do think the unlocked door is a bit strange, I'd expect your landlord to have a key.

On some level I get not wanting people in your home, but then the answer is for you or your partner to re-arrange things so you can be home."
cyf0u1,"YTA. You would be an unbelievably, life-destroying asshole to directly report to someone’s employer that they *maybe* embezzled money at some point somewhere else. If you can’t prove it, you’re likely also legally liable for any damage you cause to this person financially. If you have a vendetta against this person, try to find a more petty and less legally unwise route."
cyf3jy,"I'd say a weak YTA, namely since you piped in with a line that had nothing to do with what they were talking about, if they just were stating a fact (she's lost weight) not saying ""she's hot now"" or anything like that.

Try talking to her about her worries (what exactly about the people she doesn't know is she worried about), or make it clear that you're going to be responsible and have a good time, yet still be there to care for you kids just as she would do if she were able to stay home and watch them herself."

Being a stay at home parent means taking care of the house while the other parent takes care of the income. It's not discrimination against women, since it would be the same logic if you were a woman working full time and she was a stay at home husband. You would spend like what? 8 hours a day, maybe 10, bringing in money for BOTH of you to survive. It would only be fair for her to do the chores for BOTH of you and put in equal work to maintain your household."
cyj7gk,NTA. I really don't see how these people stick around and date people who have these kinds of views. You're completely entitled to cut off friends who date these kinds of people. It often speaks of their own characters as well.

It is reasonable to want to know *roughly* where your partner is at any given time.  Some people will chafe at this idea, but it is just a practical part of an intimate relationship.  You tell people where you're going before you leave, they know your work schedule, etc.

>It’s gotten to the point where I’ll be asking him for help on some applications and mid conversation he stops answering for hours at a time because he ended up going out without letting me know or telling me.

This is nutty and really inconsiderate.


But it sounds like you're a bit needy/controlling.  If you know he is at dinner with friends, you do know roughly where he is.  Why are you annoyed if he doesn't answer his phone for an hour?  5 hours is a bit much, but if my partner was going to dinner with friends, I would expect them to be out of touch for *at least* 2 hours.  Unless it was something urgent (""house on fire!"") or somehow time sensitive (""we're out of milk, pls pick up on way home"") I wouldn't contact them.

He won’t match the other bridespeople no matter what he does. If he wears a dress he’ll stick out as the only person in the wedding party who is cross-dressing. 

It’s your wedding and if you want it to be about you instead of a social statement, that’s not AH behavior. 

He’s being an AH by trying to force his clothing preference (this might be understandable if he were normally a cross-dresser) or his social statement into the only wedding you’ll ever have. 

If he wants to match you should find (or have made) a suit or tux that is the same color as the bridesmaid dresses. If that can’t be found and money is an issue then you may have to settle for a tie/cummerbund that matches the dresses."

Do you have any close friends you can confide in? Anyone you can talk to? This looks like it is taking a huge toll on you, and understandably so. If you don't offload some of the burden you are carrying, you are at risk of falling into a downward spiral with more severe issues (and it also sounds like your brother and mother, at least, would benefit from talking to someone).

I pulled the same tactic as you did many times, walking out on a conversation about mental health because i ""couldn't handle it"" when in truth i didn't want to face my problems. 

Walking out of such conversations gets you nowhere. So while I don't blame you for doing it, it's not a good thing to do and you shouldn't do it again. 

She is right when she says that unless you stop complaining and start acting, nothing will change and you will feel like shit forever. I too whined about my problems without adressing them  and then got pissed when people asked me why i wasn't doing anything about it.  

Neither of you are assholes. But she did make a legitmate point and while you are justified for walking out on this occasion, dont do it again. Stay and talk about it listen to what she has to say.

**EDIT below**

Thanks for the info. I'm mightily confused as to why your cousin (a self-proclaimed women's rights champion) would call her female cousin ""bro"" - but I think it aptly summarises her in a nutshell (or maybe it's just cause us Brits don't understand).

I would say NTA. You could probably have been more diplomatic about how you approached her at the outset, as she basically instantly went on the defensive and from that point onwards you lost any chance you had of making her see the issue with her conduct  (because when people go defensive they clam up and double down on the opinions they have which are being challenged). As a man, I don't find her initial post particularly rude in the context (it's a female version of guys' talk - it isn't the best thing in the world but as a joke it's sort of acceptable, even if quite poor taste), but then she definitely became TA as the conversation with you unfolded. I have to say it was quite difficult to read through it without becoming frustrated at the level of pedantry on show.

Next time, I would try taking it up with her verbally and in a more non-confrontational way, if you actually want to make her improve. Verbal communication allows you to give physical cues which disarms people - statements that can feel aggressive on paper become better understood when accompanied with body language (unless you're, uh, shouting at them and spitting over them, etc).

2. The fact that he is very meticulous about his own privacy makes things worse.  It's basic courtesy to behave with people the way you expect them to behave with you.  You can't have two sets of rules - one for yourself, one for everyone else.  


3. The way he shrugged this off and tried to make you the asshole is wrong and a way to deflect blame."
cyr4l1,"YTA, overstepped by a lot.  Just assuming because you have her password you a right to go through her phone and respond to HER texts, is a major overstep and breach of privacy.

I am unsure why you felt the need to answer her phone and her messages despite it NOT being your phone regardless if the texts were addressed to you or not?  You think that her friends are your friends after meeting them one time - yikes that is so cringeworthy and desperate. 

You disrespected her boundaries and then when she was clear about why she was upset, you tried to make her sound like she was in the wrong. 

You used her phone, but does she go through yours like that?"
cyr590,"NAH  
  
This isn't a great situation to be in and honestly, theres very little in way of being delicate about it. The best you can hope for is to just say ""look, I know its a weird thing to say but I drive a small car and I need to be conscious of how much weight I put in my car between people and cargo.""  
  
Then suggest that you take 3 of the average people but you can take extra cargo to help free up room in the van and that should keep you under your 850lb limit to help protect your suspension and undercarriage."
cyr6j7,NTA. You asked her to take care of them and she didn’t. It’s basically a breach of trust. Totally valid.
cyraf1,If she overcharged you on a bill underpay her til its right. she can take you to court but shell lose
cyrbl4,"YTA for saying to feed it to the dogs, onions are toxic for dogs."
cyrngw,"NTA - if you don’t need to take the exams again and you’ve made sure you can still get into the uni or college that you want to then why bother with the stress. I guess it ultimately comes down to whether you are happy with your grades or whether you will feel like you could have or should have done more, don’t let your parents pressure you into doing them if you feel okay within yourself!"
cyrnre,"No. You abided by the parking lot traffic Dow direction. Once you pass a spot it is courteous to pull back around, not throw it in reverse."
cyrpj0,">So would I be the asshole if I tell those 3 ""NO"" and the reason WHY next time they ask me for cigs when they're over here? 

NTA at all, this is exactly what you should do. Don't be mean about it, but by all means do stick up for yourself."
cyrqp9,NTA. What you do/don’t tell your family is up to you. From the looks of it you’re not doing anything illegal or dangerous so the best advice I can give you is get out of the toxic environment ASAP and in the mean time look for a family therapist/a therapist for yourself. Therapy might not solve all problems but at the very least you’ll be given a chance to vent and you’ll be taught some ways of dealing with your mother’s behavior.
cyrs87,"Honestly, YTA.

Being mad at someone and spilling their secrets are two different things. No matter how badly someone was pressing for details it doesn't really excuse you, you could've just said ""it's not my business to tell, you should ask her not me""."
cyrsxl,"Your friend is an asshole for telling you about her pictures in the first place, and both you and your friends are even bigger assholes for ""digging"" into her info even further. You'll be the king of all assholes if you ruin his apparently happy relationship over it.

You say your friend is 30, so i'd assume you are around the same age, but tbh you sound like a 15 year old making such a big deal out of all this."
cyrzfk,"NTA. This chick sounds like she’s doing some pretty impressive mental gymnastics or is having a hard time reconciling her feelings with her upbringing.

If you don’t have it in you to support her during her breakup that’s totally cool. If you really wanna be a good friend, you might ask her if she’s wrestling with old and new beliefs, but that’s a courtesy she might not deserve."
cys0oc,Cleaning up vomit is far enough beyond your job description as to have full grounds to refuse to do it. NTA.
cys1d5,">and to the regular person, I would be embarrassed,

Why are you embarrassed about pulling out a pad? Vast majority of women have periods - why are you embarrassed of it?"
cys2nc,"NTA. I sort of understand where he's coming from, but he brought this on himself by creating a hostile situation between you too. Not your fault that his mom and aunt see through the BS, they probably just really liked you."
cys34k,"NTA  based on your local schools, homeschooling is probably widespread.  Start looking for homeschool groups to join for socialization, they're every where.

Your sisters idea of the stereotypical homeschooled student is based on outdated homeschool practices which included isolation, and bible/faith  based learning."

cys7sg,"ESH- the car owner is a dick for continuously parking poorly and taking up two spaces.

You could’ve however just reported him to the landlord? Or the city? Why stick gum on his car with a note? That’s really gross and rude"
cys8xz,"NTA- I’m surprised by the comments here. Honestly, us women cannot have it all. We can’t say “you don’t get a say in my abortion!” while also saying “you have to pay for my abortion!”  We can’t say “I’m keeping this baby and it’s your responsibility!” and also say “I’m not keeping this baby, and it’s YOUR responsibility!”. 

Her body, her choice, your money, your choice. The only thing you’re responsible for is the child that comes from this mess. If she wanted an abortion, she could’ve paid for it. Rights come with responsibilities, they always have."
cys9al,"NTA - simply put the question to them: ""if I'd gone away too, who would pay?"" And wait forever for a response."
cys9hn,NTA they didnt keep their end of the promises up and were just not decent humans
cys9k5,"NAH. They should have made sure to give the deposit to the right person or at least have a clear record of who they gave it to. That’s their own fault, and they’re making it right. If you ask your family and someone admits to claiming it and pays you back, then you can rip up the check from the campground."
cysbe0,[deleted]
cyse12,NTA especially with how she treated you and I’m appalled your father would have stayed with a woman who treated his child like that
cyshkq,"ESH - If the cat had been hit by a car, eaten by a coyote, or any of the other terrible deaths that befall cats when they’re left outside, it would be no different. She took responsibility for these cats, and letting them roam around unsupervised is irresponsible and dangerous, so in that case, yes, it’s partially her fault. But it’s still an insensitive thing to say to someone who is grieving a loss and her neighbor sounds like a completely horrible person if they truly poisoned the cat.  Everyone in this story sucks."
cysno0,"NAH. I think you can say it like this ‘as someone who recently had a baby (true from post history, no?), I noticed there are a few things you could use that you might not have thought to put on your registry! Would it be helpful for me to send you a list?’ She’s a 16 year old about to be a mom, I doubt she’ll be mad about hearing from an actually supportive, helpful adult."
cysokk,NTA. Assuming it was just to gossip then yeah that’s kind of a dick move.
cysvsz,"NTA, if it’s your cousin’s parents job to deal with him, who does the responsibility fall to when they neglect that?"
cysw7g,"NTA you guys all agreed to the arrangement. If they had had an issue with it they could have spoken up at the time. Plus, you're already going beyond what you originally agreed to by driving them to the farther destination. You're doing them a favour when you can and paying more than they do for the same destination, the least they can do is accommodate you when you're low on cash!"
cysxll,"ESH. You could have done much more to earn money, like not working for your mom. If she didn't pay the internet, you could have gone to the library to use the internet. WiFi is not exotic or hard to find these days. Your mother should pay you for the work you did, of course. She sucks for that. But you are an adult. Make better choices in the future"
cysxs3,"NTA

You have no arms, what did they expect you to cook with? Your ass? 

Sorry your friends are such douches."
cyt0h3,"NTA, in times past people would have maybe read a book or the paper in your position, still the same thing - when nothing's happening and you're paid to essentially be sat there you have to do something to pass the time. It sounds like you're professional though, dealing with customers as required and would help out if asked to elsewhere.

I think your concern is a separate thing, the worry that as a newbie you might get in trouble. You're not doing a bad job, that doesn't necessarily mean a boss wouldn't perceive you as doing something wrong by using the ipad during quiet times."
cyt1ih,"NTA I don’t know if something is going on that you don’t know about, but they’re being assholes. I worked as a housekeeper for a while and there are just some bitchy ass housekeepers that think they’re too good for the job or something. This group just kinda sounds like that.

Report them. Their attitude is unacceptable."
cyt2nl,[deleted]
cyt547,NAH I am a woman and I notice pretty girls too. As long as you’re not gawking you’re fine.
cyt80d,"NAH, do honestly not think she doesn't know they will see? She either doesn't care or she likes the attention. 

If you're uncomfortable with that piece of her, then you aren't wrong for asking her to stop, but she isn't an asshole for saying no."
cytavs,"NTA. Ghost away. She knows why. If you fade out of her life she’ll have to live with the fact she chose dangerous, unkind people over someone (you) who sounds like a thoughtful and good-hearted friend. If you stuck around she could continue to live in denial about how bad her new friends’ behavior is. Losing your presence is a natural consequence of hanging out with awful people. 

Don’t get sucked into her shame spiral/pity party. Peace out if you want to, or maybe send a message first along the lines of “I care about you and will be here if you decide to move on from this crowd and their destructive behavior.”

(And honestly it’s your prerogative to end a friendship for any reason. This just happens to be a really compelling reason.)

Good luck. I’m sorry this is happening. ❤️"
cytedi,"NAH

I love the sentiment behind this gift and it sounds as if your girlfriend doesn't mind you doing it either. It's wonderfully thoughtful.

Congrats on the sobriety and happy birthday to your dad when it comes!"
cyti76,"NAH It's hard right, I grew up with divorced parents and there were times I didn't want to spend weekends with my dad because roughly around the same age as you 11-12 he would go out in the evening for a few hours and come back drunk or be drinking around me.

The best solution is talking to your mother about how you feel and that you do obviously want to see him but when he's more able to be responsible and not feel like a threat."
cyti7v,NTA - I am SUPER CONFUSED as to why your BF gives a shit if you press a button. WTF is wrong with this dude??
cytnnk,"ESH — your SIL for obvious reasons, and you for endangering your child in the first place by bringing *a 13-week-old infant* to that house when you know the dogs are not trained, and not insisting the dogs be locked up when you saw they were “running wild”

Your first duty is to protect your child, and you didn’t do that.  Do better next time."
cytnqt,"NAH. I think you’re putting way too much emotional emphasis on this. She’s buying consumable goods, you’re not consuming them for days, and then she consumes them. Just stop buying food/drink with her that isn’t for you guys to have right away."
cytoyl,"YTA. 

Her coming out went poorly and your only reaction is thinking about yourself and how you would get home when public transportation exists and your mom also offered? C’mon. 

It sounds like your girlfriend has been doing her best to support you, but don’t forget that she has a life and problems outside of you. You’re worried about her being there for you, but when was the last time *you* were there for her?"
cytzbv,"NAH, so far.

You have every right to break up with your girlfriend, but it would be an asshole move to not give her good advance warning about how you feel about it when you now clearly have the option of doing so.

Similary she would be an asshole if she went to a one-on-one with another single male, who is clearly coming on to her, while in a relationship..*if and only if* she has bad intentions or knows you are not comfortable with it.  That's why communication is key, she can't act to make you happy if she doesn't know what would make you happy and what would make you unhappy."

As someone in school studying creative writing it is not easy to get anywhere as an author and every penny helps from book sales. Piracy is not and should never be acceptable and I admire your stance on it.
In the future though I’d probably put a note on the bottom of the flyer just to prevent the same happening in future"
cyubs7,"YTA if she’s moved on she wouldn’t be texting you to let you know she’s available, either she’s trying to mess up your situation or has feelings for you. You said you’re friendly, but rarely speak so why would she want to make sure you had this news? Come on now."
cyuidb,"NTA, if he is so uncomfortable he probably doesn't want to come anyway. But it seems very strange that he won't even look at you. Are you sure there isn't another reason for the way he acts?"
cyul5u,"You can tell him you will continue to flirt, he can decide to break up with you. NAH. You would be TA if you try to hide it though."

cyuqqu,"NTA but you should talk to them first. If they refuse to remediate the situation, then go to the HOA."
cyuv99,"NTA I feel you girl, I am thin naturally as well, and lost a couple extra pounds the past couple of weeks because I've been moving and stressed etc, literally this morning I was making a payment on my traffic tickets and the guy that was taking the payment was making friendly small talk, then as he gives me my receipt is like

 ""So how much cash do you have left?""

""$400""

""Ok well then after you leave you need to go to the market and buy some food!""

I don't know why people think it's ok to make comments like that, especially people you don't know. What if I was sick, and had cancer or something?"
cyuxlv,NTA You’re being totally reasonable. He should put in some effort into the relationship too.
cyuz0w,"NTA. 21F cosmetologist. It’s not your job, it’s mine. They can pay to go get their hair done and ask their licensed cosmetologist allllll about different types of hair. It’s a $25,000 on average certification for a reason."
cyuzds,"ESH, you and your mother. Yes it is your job to set up boundaries to your mother. Same would apply if your mil would do the same to you: it would be your boyfriend's job to protected you. It's cowardly not to say anything when your loved one it treated bad."
cyuzog,"NTA

Unfortunately, your bills don't care about his mother's health."
cyuzwb,NTA. It's not uncommon for abusers to try to remedy the situation in the days following an abusive outburst. Continue to follow up with your counselor or call your state or region's abuse and neglect hotline. You can make the report yourself. Keep the picture of the bruise.
cyv2ba,"NAH.

No one’s an asshole only because it sounds like nobody has gently told her directly that this behavior is off-putting. Sure, it’s going to hurt her feelings but I’d want to know if someone felt that way about me.

Some people spew endless crap because they’re nervous/anxious. I know sometimes I talk a lot when my anxiety is bad, but definitely not always. 

You all were polite and tried to gently send cues that her behavior was annoying and, unfortunately, some people cannot pick up on gentle cues. I’ve had friends like that: I’ve literally done everything to get my point across except tell the direct solution and they haven’t “gotten” it. It sucks to be direct (when you feel like it could potentially hurt), but sometimes you just have to be."
cyv3bx,"NAH. It’s money already spent. It sound like you brother isn’t very engaged. It might be because he’s lazy, but it might be inaction because he’s anxious. I think everyone is your family is a little stressed. Just let it go."
cyv5ho,"NTA. 

You have a buyer lined up for 4,000 not 3,400. He benefits from being your friend when you sell it to him for 4,000 rather than the buyer you had lined up. 

Your friend sounds rather entitled."
cyv79x,"YTA. Better hope she didn’t hear you. 

Administration sets policies. Policy is to have a pass, and the teacher said he didn’t send you. What do you expect her to do or to think?

Are you newly a senior or junior? You don’t run that place. They do. Focus on your work and doing well. Playing policy games over something totally not critical isn’t going to get you where you want to go. Which is out of there and on to bigger and better things."
cyv90b,"NAH. You are communicating poorly. Please don’t fall into this trap where you do whatever the hell you want and expect her to be explicit about every little thing. Try to be attentive and kind. And she needs to use her words.

This is coming from someone who has been married for 20 years, most of it happily. Both parties need to say what they mean and mean what they say. But both parties also need to anticipate the other’s needs and wants.

It’s not about the phone, exactly. It’s about whether she feels you are attentive. There’s a compromise here. Try to discuss how to meet each other’s needs rather than trying to determine who is right and who is wrong."
