cyvatv,"NTA

The kid doesn't live with you and you don't have any plans with him, so it's definitely not your responsibility to be his Uber driver."
cyvd8x,"YTA your wedding is in two months which means this bridesmaid has already bought the dress, shoes, made arrangements to be at your wedding.  Yes she is being tacky by only talking about her wedding, but you will straight up ruin this friendship if you demote her now. 

Have you tried talking to her about how much she is talking about her own wedding? Maybe she doesn’t realize how bad it is?"
cyvdd2,"NTA. You don’t owe her anything. If your life is great now, keep doing what you’re doing."
cyvfh4,"You’re never the asshole for communicating what you want, and what you want is always valid and should be widely accepted and discussed. 
I say, NTA."
cyvjur,"NAH.  It’s totally fine to ask your friend to not post it to your social group FB page. They might do it anyway, but I think you can tell your friends that you need some space from your ex etc."
cyvkce,"NTA. You tip based on the service you receive. If you were unsatisfied with the service, you shouldn't tip."
cyvkkf,YTA it’s non of your business. Let your married boss figure it out
cyvp47,"You're NTA, but you do need to decide if the food is worth her hurt feelings. She has a right to feel betrayed when her boyfriend regularly dumps her to go look at other women scantily clad (tbh, this sound less like real bellydancing and more like ""Hooters, but with falafel""). The best option here is to find a nice restaurant that both of you like going to and bring her to eat there."
cyvtdt,"NTA, if your brother is that stupidly violent you could have also called the police while he was causing the damage too, a night in the drunk tank may have been an enlighting experience for him"
cyvvtw,"NAH. I don’t know why he would be so opinionated about forcing you to replace your original ring. For most people, it holds sentimental value. I think your suggestion of wearing the new one in addition to the original is a good compromise."
cyvw10,"NTA. Weddings are overrated and nowadays they're like ''look how rich I am''. Enjoy your vacation, spend your money on you and your family and not on a stupid wedding."
cyvwjz,"NTA, she sounds like a child. I got severe anxiety but I don't feel the need to snap at others or nit-pick at every little thing. You deserve a good vacation without the constant complaining"
cyvywr,"YTA for one major reason. When it comes to people's health and their bodies, the choice is theirs. If you don't like their continued smoking, stop hanging out with them. Nagging when it seems like they've straight out told you they aren't interested in stopping is just annoying"
cyw1jm,"Tom sounds like a drama queen who has no clue how adult communication works. When grownups have an issue, they say what it is. He is holding you emotionally hostage. I  would tell him ""well it seems I did something really awful but since you don't want to tell me what it is so I can fix it, I guess this friendship is over. Have a nice life, BYE""

NTA"
cyw8po,"NTA.  He, as the buyer, should have done research into owning a boat before he bought it."
cyw8tl,"Awe - this is heartbreaking for the boy. It’s sad that your family is blaming this other woman and making the baby pay for it. Your son is the one who cheated, not this little boy.

Wow, Silver!! Thank you"
cywbol,NTA. Don’t do unpaid emotional labor for men. They’re old enough to write things on a calendar.
cywbq2,"NTA. Also if the bride doesn’t want you to be there, please do bow out gracefully and go enjoy your day somewhere. Don’t give in to pressure to do the job or to show up regardless of this silly drama."
cywgo3,"NTA, 3 years doesn’t sound that big but when it’s a 15 year old and a 18 year old it’s different because of the levels of maturity. I’d keep an eye of on him and try to explain to your girlfriend about the aspect of maturity"
cywh02,"NAH.  Irresponsible and clearly unaware of your limits, yes. if you lied to your gf about continuing to drink -asshole. i’m sure you’ve learned a very valuable lesson that many before you had but didn’t learn. i’m just not sure this makes you an asshole, ya know."
cywi04,YTA. You’ve told her. Now leave it. She’s an adult. She can make her own decisions.
cywi3v,Lol. Get friends who have lives and this problem will resolve itself.
cywomc,"NTA based on additional information. 

INFO Going just on what you wrote, you are absolutely not the asshole. Not at all. I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt and say she's not the asshole either. Your son is 15 months old and she has been out of work the whole time. Has she talked to a doctor about post-partum depression? If this behavior (not cleaning, expecting more from you possibly as a redirection of her frustration with herself for not doing it, etc.) is out of the norm for her, it's something to bring up with a medical professional.

Edit: changed vote from INFO to NTA."
cywpza,"NTA. Assuming you guys can afford to lose $600(!!!) when you have a baby on the way, who the fuck can't wait until they get home to watch porn and watches it in public? Your husband has a problem OP.

IMO the emotional distress etc is bullshit. I would have thought all that is affecting you at least as much as him.

What really takes the cake, though, is him messaging an ex talking about his need to masturbate. It's probably too early to say this but I wouldn't be surprised if he one day cheats."
cywv25,"NTA

You want some peace and you're getting it. You're not making a fuss about it, or complaining to anyone. If your dad would rather you fail school because you can't study and do your homework, that's his own problem. You don't need to sacrifice your mental health for a baby who is not your responsibility (as long as you're not the only one at home who can take care of her)"
cywvsl,"YTA. If you think there's nothing wrong with what you did, why not tell your friend?"
cywzbm,"NTA he was playing the race card in order to shame/scare you into giving him money. I also live in a bigger city in the us, and most homeless people are pretty harmless in their requests, but sometimes they have a weird aggressive  tactics that border on entitlement"
cyx0m5,"YTA

If your daughter is in middle school, what's the problem with her being there on her own for awhile? I don't think you telling your ex that you were taking her to court and going for full custody was warranted. You overreacted here, big time.

Your ex is probably fed-up with your work schedule. She can't make plans on your weekends because she never knows what the schedule will be."
cyx3gr,NAH. This has the potential to be a huge boost for your future. Your friend is unlikely to accept that but I don't see how you could turn down this opportunity.
cyx52m,NAH. It’s understandable to feel hurt when your friend starts dating your ex. But your friend isn’t in the wrong either.
cyx7oh,"NTA
Fuck'em."
cyx89n,Are you sure youre 21 and not 12?
cyx9y4,NTA. You've warned them repeatedly and they are being excessively loud. You have every right to involve law enforcement.
cyxbrr,"NTA. They have leash laws for this very reason. People always say its friendly, but one time is all it takes."
cyxd0t,Nta there is a age gap and coming from the same age i also hate playing with younger kids under 8 because i dont like playing with toys and 8 and up are more in to realer things imo
cyxdmq,"https://www.bustle.com/p/why-you-should-never-flush-the-toilet-with-the-lid-up-40228

Put the seat and the lid down! You're covering your bathroom in poop particles!"
cyxdtg,YTA. Do tired kids suck? Yes. But it’s once on a freaking holiday weekend. It’s not about respect or “time management.” It’s just staying up to late once over the summer.
cyxifd,"NTA.

I laughed out loud at your friend, so ridiculous. Basically ""I can't afford this because I am 16 and pregnant, so my 15 year old best friend should pay for it."" I know you have known this girl for a long time but she sounds insufferable."
cyxjnm,"NTA.

""No"" is a complete sentence."
cyxl5y,"NTA. You're allowed to feel whatever you feel. Everyone feels jealousy and like life is a little unfair from time to time. It's not necessarily reasonable, but that's ok. 

As long as you control your actions, that's what matters. And it sounds like you're doing that. It's okay to throw a tiny pity party for yourself, as long as you don't take it out on others."
cyxnk3,"NTA: it sounds like you do most of the chores and pay for most expense. If she doesnt wanna go laundry then yall can write up a schedule of who does what then. 

Does she have any issue physically doing stuff? I'm confused why you pay for most things and do most of the chores."
cyxsjh,"YTA.. 3 months is a little more than “just having fun”. Don’t string her along, if you don’t want to be with her then just let her go"
cyxv5f,NTA. There are quiet hours for a reason
cyxvik,"NTA. But it won't help anything either. He checked out years ago. He knows that. You saying something isn't going to make it better. It will only mean you see him less than you do now, and he will likely resent you on top of it. It ultimately won't make either of you feel better."
cyy2ig,NTA. It is extremely rude and inconsiderate for your parents to just sign you up for babysitting. Have you tried talking to your parents about this?
cyy3b9,"YTA,  but only because you’re ghosting her. You don’t owe anyone your time or friendship, but it’s emotionally intelligent and kind to at least explain what’s up so your former friend isn’t left twisting in the wind."

cyy48m,NTA for not doing the whole Santa thing but *Pippa’s kind of an asshole for spoiling it for others
cyy68e,"NAH. She needs to learn boundaries, but where I’m from in the midwest, this is normal. 21F. I called my best friends mom mom.... like everyone did that. She was my second mom. It was awesome."
cyy81b,"YTA stop doing it around him.  You can help them practice, but otherwise he is the outsider and that’s unfair.  He’s already seemingly done a lot to embrace your culture and not his.  Learning two languages in classes outside of school would be a lot, so at least speak your common language around him."
cyyaqe,NTA. Your mom is a guilt machine.
cyyb7g,[deleted]
cyyhk5,NTA. Those people were obviously assholes.
cyyk1h,NTA and she sounds like an alcoholic if this keeps happening
cyykya,Nta.  Is it even dark at the time she wants you to sleep?  I wonder if she doesn't realize you are growing up.  Changing sleep schedules that much is not really feasible or best for your body.
cyylhc,"Info:  why do you feel so obligated?

Could you just say something like, ""Thanks for thinking of me but had to get out of the business and just registered it for myself.  Best to you in your search."""
cyyll4,NTA.  Perhaps posting a last entrance time would help.
cyym3q,"3 people staying, split that shit 3 ways. YTA if your in the married couple and want to split 2 ways. That's like going to dinner with a 3rd wheel and hoping to split the bill in half."
cyymkz,Hard to make a single judgment here but if you said crate or shelter I would say NTA. I am a dog person but despise people who make excuses for dogs they haven’t trained. No hate for the dogs but the owners suck.
cyymos,"You need to stick to your promise to your kids or they won't call you for a ride the next time they're drunk, and will likely try to drive themselves home. 

That said, you should eventually tell your wife; that you're handling it, and why.   Maybe just not yet, though."
cyymxu,"YWBTA      

Instead of ghosting her, tell her you want a break. You don’t have to tell her why or how long it will last, because if you try to then you’ll end up in a conversation/disagreement on how you feel & why. Maybe you’ll want to have that conversation one day, but for now you just need to make it clear that you’re not trying to hurt her, you just need a break.       


A friend ghosted me 5 years ago, and I thought he was my best friend, I considered him family. My heart was broken & I spent months spiraling down because I had no idea why he wasn’t communicating with me, when we had normally communicated/hung out every day. I would’ve hated to hear that he wanted a break from me, which ended up being the case as we’re again still friends, but it would’ve hurt less if I’d known that he just needed time to himself/other friends or people."
cyyown,"ESH. Your girlfriend responded HARSHLY, but i also understand the frustration of asking someone to stop making jokes at your expense and people continue to do it. M seems to have misunderstood. Shes an asshole in this scenario but i understand her perspective. 

You are an asshole because of how you spoke to her. Your title says you asked her to apologize, but you didnt. You demanded it of her, which is not your place. I understand wanting to defend your friend, but theres a difference between “you should apologize” and “you’re going to apologize.” As much as she was rude, you cant command her to do anything. You both need to have a calm conversation about what happened because you both seem heated. Take some time to cool off and then settle the drama"
cyyqx6,YTA. Thank the person for the thought and move on.
cyyrwf,"I'm not current with US anti-piracy measures.  Your roommate got caught once, so it seems plausible that he'll get caught twice.  If two times gets you a ban, then NTA.  You can't risk it.  He can get his own connection if he wants to pirate on it."
cyys2a,NTA.  Good lord.  This is the sort of situation that can turn tragic with frightening speed.  He should probably educate himself on how quickly children can and do drown.  This can literally and easily turn into a having a kid with a permanent brain injury or a funeral service with a tiny coffin.  Snap at him again for being so out of touch about this situation.
cyyseh,YTA-grow up its a piece of cloth that can be purchased anywhere.
cyysqx,"NTA. This is probably their first time ""living on their own"" so you're helping them understand that *how they act can have consequences*. While your worry of possible retaliation is normal, I'd venture you've nothing to worry about. People often SAY they are ""gonna get that nothing to do ass"" but won't actually commit because deep down they don't want to deal with the ramifications. If anything, start playing tag-team with the other neighbor; alternate calling in the cops when you have to so they police see it's more than one neighbor.   
You're the adult, and you're adulting like a boss all over this situation."
cyyu3b,"Personally, NTA. I do this all the time. I vent to my husband about how my coworkers are stupid or being really dumb, but if my husband told me (not jokingly) that I am stupid, I’d be pissed. You were probably just venting earlier and I think it was unjustified to be that harsh with you."
cyyvio,"NAH but I feel she could still go, just separately from you. You'd have to suck it up assuming you bought seats next to each other or anything, but likely you could still make it work. Seems unfair for her to be unable to enjoy her vacation just because you two are no longer traveling together."
cyyww2,"NTA but I would’ve folded the towels personally. Everyone uses towels. But meh, not a big deal and you definitely ain’t no asshole bud"
cyyxhn,"NTA - seriously yelled at you for not getting your BF to get her a gift? This is not a normal adult response, even if it was expected of you. 

Maybe it’s just a cultural difference but expecting a gift from a visitor?"
cyz1zf,"NAH.  You wanting to get to bed early is perfectly fine, but 9 o'clock is also a reasonable time for them to be wanting to do things (I wouldn't define them as insomniacs by the information you've presented).

You're just in a shitty situation.  It sounds like the house needs some rearranging so that the bedroom isn't the hangout spot."
cyz4c1,"YTA. You should have calmly discussed this with your son before just removing it. Maybe it was his idea and he was too afraid to tell you because of the way you reacted. Maybe he's never expressed interest to you since he could predict how you would react. If it was his idea, you just made the hole close up by removing it too soon before it was healed, meaning he sat through the pain and now it was for nothing. 

It's his body, not yours. 8 years old is old enough to decide if they want ear(s) peirced, boys or girls. And many many boys his age have ear piercings.

And mom sucks for not telling you, but you're the bigger asshole by removing the earring before calmly discussing your son's intentions with him.

ETA. Based on following comment from OP, he's definitely TA. He wouldn't have acted the way he did if it was his daughter. 

""Like it or not, I think gender does somewhat play a role here. A little girl with both ears pierced is different from a little boy with one earring in his right earlobe."""
cyz76c,YTA for using initials instead of fake names.
cyz8tt,"NAH- you don’t have to give her your jumper, she doesn’t have to wear a bra. She can bring her own jacket and if she wants to complain about people staring just let her because honestly it’s easier than fighting about it (and there are no winners in that battle) and she just wants to vent not really do anything about it. I do it all the time, it’s good to vent."
cyzbbq,"YTA. I get your point, but there's a pretty obvious division between home and work - you're also getting PAID for your extra dishes. Sister shouldn't have to do more just because you got a job, that has nothing to do with her. Pay her for your half, if you want, or trade for a different chore."
cyzbhl,"I'm going to go ahead and say YTA.

I don't think YTA for being disappointed; it's fairly reasonable to be bummed when you're looking forward to something, and it doesn't work out for you. However, it was how you finished this post, saying:  


> And I was a little taken back by ‘a GOOD cause’... like mine wasn’t. 

A good cause is a good cause, according to your post she even apologized and said she was sorry, but donated them to a different cause. The bikes belonged to her, and she can make the judgement as to whether one cause is more deserving than another. In fact, she didn't even say your reason for wanting the bike wasn't a good cause, but she ma have felt that the donation to this mental health program was a better use of *her* bikes."
cyzc0d,"NTA. For future reference, dont explain why you cant pick up a shift, they legally arent allowed to ask. Just say you had a prior commitment or obligation"
cyzdgz,"NTA at all. We all have tough situations in our lives, but it doesn’t mean we deserve someone else’s art/time for free. Personally, I would not do it since you are about to have a baby. You could say something like, “I would love to help, but I would be overcommitting myself  at this time.” Or “Your project sounds wonderful. As much as I would love to be involved, I can’t give your project the attention it deserves right now. I’m cheering for your success. Thank you for thinking of me.”

But if you really do what to take on the gig, maybe say something like, “Your project sounds wonderful and I would love to help. What is your budget like?” Just to maybe test the waters and see where their mind is at with this."
cyze81,"Yta

Plain and simple you offended him. By telling him that he could be possibly harming his dog, you suggested that he doesn’t properly take care of the animal. It was a misunderstanding. 

But what makes you the asshole is your post. You never even thought about his response. Just mind your own business. Instead you have come up with several things that might be wrong with him, or your pitch, or how you could have possible intimidated him. When in reality he doesn’t care about your opinion. If you fee the need to apologize, apologize for assuming you knew what was best for his pet. But I’d say just let it be. He obviously doesn’t care what you have to say."
cyze8u,NTA. Maybe I'm way off but that sounds like some bridezilla type shit. 2 moths apart seems like quite a bit of time.
cyzeke,ESH. Don't you have to be at least 13 to join reddit?
cyzfgx,"""but the way i was looking at the situation... I dont really care about this women. It was just something to do,""

You're really asking if you're the asshole while having this in your explanation?"
cyzi2v,Nta - she (edit spelling) mentioned it first and may have been trying to find a way to connect/make small talk with a new person
cyzl0a,"NAH

She trusts you, and wants to confide in you, and that's great. You want to help your mom, but realize that you can't. Not only can't  you, but you shouldn't--it's not your place to be her therapist.

Your mother needs a therapist to help her through these things--someone impartial in whom she can confide. Try to steer her that way, and be supportive of her, but don't play counselor."
cyzp8d,definitely NTA. your parents sound dreadful.
cyzq8z,"NTA, she’s probably just oblivious to the fact that having a camera in a living room with people you don’t know well isn’t cool unless they say it’s ok. I’d definitely speak with her before messing with the system though. 

She should definitely be letting you know ahead of time she’s bringing her sister to stay so nta for that either."
cyzr1k,"NTA.

This is your home and you didn’t say, “he can come over whenever he wants and spend the night as well.”

And I assume you don’t know this dude very well. Another reason why letting him stay at your house overnight may not be the best idea, especially when you have a young child in your home."
cyzvcl,"You demanded a gift, bragged about it to your child and set her expectations, and then got angry when it didn’t work out the way you demanded. You sound like the self-centered one. YTA"
cyzwzd,"YTA You shouldn't have to lie to your SO to ""trick"" him into giving you the affection you want. If you want him to be more tender and sweet, you should tell him that instead of pretending to be ill. I know that this sort of conversation is hard, but it's better for your relationship in the long run."
cyzx5j,NTA. I'd say apologize- not because you did anything wrong- but only to ensure things remain friendly and so you can find out for certain if they really thought you were being hostile. I think the most important thing is making sure they know it's for their own dog's safety.
cz009f,"NTA, and particularly NTA as you are looking to repay him (which, while kind, isn’t necessary). However, be prepared for this to be your outing, if you will, as your parents will likely be very upset and want to understand why you do not want to go. Part of getting older is standing up for what you believe in and communicating that without being a jerk. No one should force religion on you, especially now that you are an adult, but if you are living in your parents house / they are paying for you to live and you think it would severely damage your relationship to stop going to church altogether that’s very understandable. It’s very possible your parents and pastor have noticed your lack of enthusiasm and this is a targeted effort to bring you back into the fold, with it already being paid for as a way to guilt you into going. You are not a jerk for not folding to this."
cz00hz,NAH. I would just ask your landlord how he or she prefers to be notified about these things. Easy peasy.
cz050s,"I mean I would have done the same thing as you, but they you it explained it, it seems your friend might think you were agitated and annoyed by what he was saying and you told those things in a standoffish way. Then again, he might have took what you said to heart and is just trying to find himself. I'm going to say NTA, because your friend could have easily responded and said his mind."
cz05ge,"NTA he is being inappropriate, asking for nudes is not really ever a joke. When someone shows you their true colors, believe them."
cz0k4x,"NTA I don’t understand why she even took the money, pretty immature thing to do. I could imagine her being with her friends and not wanting to split from the group to get the autograph"
cz0lr1,NTA. If they're falling into your yard you can keep them. If he has a problem with it then he should have had the tree planted somewhere else. Or trim the tree so the fruit isn't dropping into your yard.
cz0nx9,"ESH except for your wife. It’s her birthday, and I think you should have asked her what she wanted. Instead, it sounds like you eagerly got in a pissing match with your mil."
cz0vpx,YTA. You did a few things wrong here namely giving a drunk person the keys to a car and not asking your other roommate Max if it was okay to impose this burden upon him. If you had asked Max if he would drive them home and he said no then you should keep the keys. If he said yes then you should've given the keys directly to him. Andrew never should have been in possession of those keys with the possibility of using them. Think about how you would feel if you woke up the next day and found out that Andrew had killed someone while driving under the influence. I'm not going to blame the drunk people here because they did their job in finding a designated driver who they thought would do the right thing for them and ended up failing them.
cz0z7u,"NAH, if the pens are being given out to employees who are leaving in bundles; then the pens are free game.

Maybe not the most professional of things to do, but not an asshole move unless this was the last two or three boxes of pens left."
cz0zd4,"YTA, not about the dress, but for your past actions and how disrespectful you are now. ""She got all my hand me downs and I'm over it"" do you not understand how much it sucks to always get used closed and rarely new because youngest? It sucks. You criticized her for being a tomboy. You now criticize her for trying to feminine. Quite frankly, you sound jealous.  

Don't let her borrow your dress if you don't want to,  but try having just a little kindness towards the younger sister you tortured.  ""It took 3 of us to hold her down *lol*""  so horrible!"
cz10ww,"NTA

cz15be,"NTA

1) They nagged on her to feel better about themselves.

2) They insulted one of the hosts without apology.

3) To me it seems they came for trouble.

4) It's your and your wive's house. 


The only tricky thing is that it maybe went too quickly to check with your wife if she saw the situation like you did.
A short ""oh I think there is something going on with the dishwasher...Darling would you help me"" and going with your wife to kitchen to quickly discuss your POVs will prevent any actions she might won't agree."
cz15vu,NAH just a simple miscommunication between you two he will get over it
cz16k2,"NTA. I think it's really your choice at the end of the day. As you say, your fiance never really spends Christmas with your family, so that means you're not obligated to go to his family. Also, your own family's Christmas leaves you feeling bad and I think your own happiness is enough reason for you to just stay put with your pets, provided you don't mind spending Christmas by yourself"
cz1b9l,The right response to that question is: This is none of your business.
cz1cfi,"This is an unfortunate one, NTA. Your ‘friends’ don’t sound like they’re deserving of that title. 

I mean, 4 years and none of them considered throwing you a party or even giving a gift. No, stuff like that isn’t technically essential, but it’s common decency and the right moral thing to do to return favours and make your loved ones big day special in whatever way you can."
cz1ds0,"Edit: I'm amending this after actually understanding what you were asking. 

NAH for asking your friend for *her part* of the refund but also I wouldn't be mad at her if she says no. 

(I had originally thought you were asking her to pay for your entire stay, not just her part of the refund. That would definitely make you TA.)"
cz1l1q,"YTA.

Unless this is a frequent occurrence, just let him show his video. Part of being a social adult is being nice and making people feel good. Be the cool person that you wish other people would be."
cz1mv8,"NTA and as someone who was bullied, you remember these interactions fondly for the rest of your life. I had a bunch of girls constantly harassing me, asking me what I was reading every few seconds. Still relish the day I finally snapped, said 'Do you want to see?' and belted her across the face with the book."
cz1pow,"""So, he's way out of his league."" YTA, like big time asshole."
cz1q10,"YTA for supporting your mom in not ostracizing an adulterer and for thinking that it's ""negative bullshit"" that this man got cheated on by his wife and never got any support by his social group just because they for some reason felt that ""keeping the peace"" was more important than doing the right thing.

You and your entire family are the embodiment of bystander apathy and you're all the asshole for it."
cz1se6,"YTA - you don’t get to decide what constitutes a “real” relationship between them and you don’t get to decide that his new persona is fake. He’s figuring himself out, and probably feels the need to act that way to be validated as “really” gay due to stereotypes and societal pressure. Or it’s who he really was and he felt the need to hide it when he wasn’t out, either way not up for you to decide it’s for attention. You questioning the first gay relationship he’s in isn’t gonna do anything but further his need to prove his sexuality, which he shouldn’t have to do. And the fact that you feel it needs to be physical (at 15 years old) in order to be a real relationship is shitty, let them move at their own pace."
cz1v5p,"What's your tenancy agreement?

In the while situation it's an everyone sucks here. But with regard to the rent, YTA. You moved in knowing what is was going to be like and you have a tenancy agreement. You are responsible for your rent."
cz1ydb,"YTA:

So basically you’re worried you’re too smart for your new young girlfriend...so you want her to study so you can CONNECT more?

Good call keeping your sister out of the fight.

Edit: That said, the parents here are way less assholes than assholes we read about here. After all, they did go out of their way to make it up to OP at the end.

They were being polite and including you as you are part of the class, but as you can't eat cheese you didn't think it was the right kind of party for you to join in on.

One suggestion I do have is, sometimes to show your gratitude for an invite and to make some new friends, you might decide to turn up for a bit to the party, have laugh or two, and leave when it gets boring for you.

You would probably have a lot more fun that you think!

Most important thing is not to feel pressured to do anything at this party or any other party going forward. Just go along and try and enjoy yourself!

Maybe he needs therapy or medication. But he definitely needs help, considering the school has reached out to his family. (Surprised to hear that for college because usually teachers don’t reach out to family for adults 18+)

However, one of his only support system (you) are denying his experiences/feelings because it burdens your own opinion? You are not a very good sister. Do better"
czbk74,Why are you enabling her shitty behavior towards you? Stop it.
czbldu,"YTA for lying about what you were going to buy. Then you still had it around your sister, even if you weren’t vaping in front of her, you may as well have pulled it out right then. You’re also the asshole for only really wanting to go to dinner with your family because they were going somewhere you could buy vape shit. 

Also, you are an adult, I get that, you do what you want, but this wasn’t the right time or place."

czbnxc,"YTA. He’s getting good grades, and he’s making a living for himself, it shows that he has a good work ethic and is capable, you should be proud of him, not upset with him.

If the wedding invite comes, decline it. If people ask you, say you’re not attending and are not discussing it further.

Edit: not an excuse at all, just a thought to maybe why, but I wonder if there family had something like cutting of money, schooling cost etc and held that against them to not associate with the typical wedding duties cause of there over the top religious beliefs?"
czcfu8,"NTA. First of all, your mom should learn history. Nazis were right wing, not left. I know the right would have you conflate Nazis with the left because of the name ""National Socialism,"" but that is just being willfully ignorant of history which, all by itself, is annoyingly ridiculous.

In all seriousness, though, I have family members like this and I just have a rule that is well understood that we don't discuss politics with each other. My mother visited a few months back and, when she got me alone, started down the whole Trumpism path. I cut her off and said... nope. Not in my house. I told her she can believe what she wants to... but she can also keep it to herself. No good is going to come from this discussion.

In the end, I love my parents, but I have to stand by my ethics and morals. I won't sit silently and let rancid crap be said in my presence. I have given up on changing them... so I can do nothing about that. But, I can set boundaries and I have.

czcjmg,"NTA

It's natural to feel bad. And you're going to feel like you have to make it up to your parents in some way. 

You already realized there was a communication issue. Next time you realize there's an issue, be proactive. Talk about what's going on. The guy speaks enough English to say '1, 2, 3, go'. 

You did a good job assessing the situation, all that's left is how you act on it. And I think next time you'll be able to say ""wait, hold on, let's figure out what we're doing here""

The repair person didn't take enough care in what he was doing. That much is clear. Good for you for posting about this to try and understand your feelings."
czcjqo,"ESH. So, she is the asshole for diminishing your problems by comparing them to hers, which is clearly unacceptable. You have right to be annoyed about this, but not that she is pining for her boyfriend once a day -- complaining about this will make you look jealous regardless of anything.

czd0c1,"ESH

Awe man so much to unpack here.

First off he’s both your son so you really don’t have any right to forbid his mom to talk to him.

Second, just because you don’t get your way you should t force your way. Your wife is correct saying you’re manipulative. But she’s being very unreasonable here in that it’s a decision that shouldn’t just be decided on overnight.

Does she have a problem with him being gay? Sounds like she does. What would be her reaction if it was straight porn? 

I’m with you, his sexual orientation is his business. Beyond giving him the talk and making sure he knows they facts about sex, it’s really his business what he wants to talk about and doesn’t want to talk about."

czd3iv,"ESH - You are an adult and made the decision to sleep with the friend when with your BF as part of group sex and individual sex without him around. If the friend behaves out if line when the BF isn't (or is) around, then you and your BF need to sort that friend out. But just because you are uncomfortable now after you did it, doesn't mean you get to dictate conditions of their friendship. If the friend comes over, and you are the one who is uncomfortable, then you should separate yourself from the situation. Overall I say ESH because group sex with friends is always a stupid as fuck decision."

czd541,"I would agree with you if he hadn't moved out at his cousin's request.

(Though legally, yes, OP is still responsible as one of the people actually on the lease.)"
czd927,"NTA. You outlined your boundaries clearly, and they are being dismissed and walked over by your friend. You also should, at the very least, be compensated for basically taking the place of a professional photographer at this wedding.

However: I would say the real issue is your parents. Why don’t they just split the money up evenly? Like I get wanting to teach your kids to share and the value of money, but that could easily be done by just diving it up evenly."
czdqgg,"NTA he broke a rule and got punished for it.  Was he actually joking?  Because there’s also a difference in sticking up for someone and lying for them. This doesn’t seem like a situation where he needed someone to stick up for him. He  swore. He got caught. If it had been a situation where he didn’t actually say anything, then yeah stick up for your boy. But this seems like he’s just mad because he got in trouble."

czesvc,"This may be unpopular, but YTA.

Your children are old enough to understand that you are possibly terminally ill, and for that reason alone they should be told.  I grew up with someone who didn't know his dad had cancer until his father died, and it *royally* fucked him up (in an understandable way).

Alongside that, you shouldn't be using your kids as emotional support animals and forcing them to lay with you when they don't want to.  Get a stuffed animal or something else to lay with for comfort.

You're going through a terrifying time - while I can't understand that, I empathize with you.  My concern is that your children will grow to resent your behavior, and that they'll say something they'll seriously regret - and that it may be too late afterwards for them to try and fix things."

If you know for a fact he’s being shorted at least $7,000 per year you HAVE to tell him. I mean, you don’t have to... but you definitely should. Give him the tools to show he figured it out for himself so it doesn’t come back at you. 

I recently learned at my job they don’t give raises unless you ask... shady, but whatever. I finally asked and we’ll see what comes through when I get my meeting. A coworker had to tell me (after being here 16 months) that I have to ask. I’m grateful she did!

czfp3z,"NTA this wasn't a gift to you, it was a contribution to something she already profited from and you told her beforehand you could not afford to pay for her.

You were right to tell her this is rude, because it was. If she can't be an adult about that, that's on her."
czfptz,"NTA but your sisters friend and your sister both are. The friend more so, of course. The friend had no right to steal from you and then act shocked when your sister asked for the shirts back. She sounds very entitled and may have some sort of jealousy of you.

It all sounded well and good with your sister until she got mad at you for telling other people. It was good that she tried to get them back (and she should continue to do so, this is not okay) but you had every right to vent about the situation to your friends. Hell, if your friends have any connection to your sisters friend, you could be warning your friends not to trust this person around their things."

Dude, you had already been having issues with her, and you went over specifically to comfort her about her dog dying. Even if it was planned, that HURTS a person.

I personally would butt out but for a completely different reason. What sort of mother can spend one more second with a man after finding out he was abusing her child? If she is going to choose him, that is up to her, but you should not have to chase after (and get upset over) a relationship with someone who prioritises an abusive partner over her own flesh and blood. I’ve personally cut off family members for a lot less! 

If I was in your situation I would give her an ultimatum - you or him. She can stay with him but you will have nothing more to do with her, or she can choose you and leave him. I understand how much she’s invested into her house and her relationship, but is it worth making you feel like shes prioritising your abuser? I know its probably hard to hear, but if she really is prioritising your abuser then is that really the sort of person who is gonna help you have a happy and successful future?

I hope this works out for you OP and that whatever you decide brings you happiness."

I kind of hide food in my room without meaning to. It’s a remaining problem due to not having enough, it being gone... my brother is the source. That’s another story though. 

So I understand the need to hide food and mental health problems. She’s not doing it to upset you. Had this been brought up in therapy?

Maybe when you move food you could leave an encouraging note in its place?

Your brother basically forced the dog to bite him.

At the same time, biting a person can never be treated indifferently, because it may give the dog the wrong message about biting being acceptable sometimes. You do not want the dog to be able to make that decision, so yes, you have shown her that you are not happy.
This is just a matter of education, though. Does not make you an asshole."

czh2zb,"ESH. Is it his office or your son’s bedroom? Sounds like it can’t be both. He acted like a dick in front of your son, and your son was going to sleep, not to make noise or play.

However, for the move, suck it up. I understand with the gap that you probably aren't going to have some wholesome loving relationship but literally every big sister in the world goes through what you're going through. 

You aren't an only child and though you don't have to drop everything for a relationship with your sister, completely icing her out is cold and cruel. Suck it up. Yes it will be annoying to deal with a 6yr old during a move  unless YOU assign her tasks because she will likely hang on your every word because you're her big sister. 

Even if you don't give her the time of day she'll idolize you.

Don't be the asshole.

czhmy8,"NTA. I’m so sorry your friend is going through all of that. Look, it seems like the relationships has reached its last breath. If you want to continue to be friends with this person, you need to make it clear that she has to talk with you about her problems and not act the way shes been acting. Try to remind her of all your good times together. As you said, when you were good, you were so so good. Everyone has their lows and this seems like it’s a deep one. If you think the friendship is truly over, you should move on and do what’s best for yourself."
czhrzi,"NTA she's being really shallow and perhaps insecure.  She liked the ring fine at first but then blatantly started comparing it to how much you spent on an ex? It's one thing if it was something that was totally not her style, but she literally picked it out.

czijo1,Info: What is SMM2 (I'm guessing Super Mario Maker 2)?
czioos,"NAH, but it sounds like you told your boss more than he needed to know. All you need to do is say you're experiencing a flare-up, not that you're anticipating one, and that a day-off in the early stages of a flare-up may prevent you needing more.

I can see why, from his perspective, it sounds like you're saying ""I need a day off to *prevent* illness,"" which in the case of most illnesses doesn't make sense. He clearly doesn't understand FM, and maybe you can't expect him to."
cziq8m,"NTA. Fake charities are crazy common. If it feels dodgy, it probably is."
czj9y1,"YTA. 

""Oh you're depressed? Get some help!""

""No.""

""Quit being a bitch!""

Apologize and leave her alone. High school is hard enough without your""friends"" calling you a bitch. You are very immature and should asses the way you treat others."
czjcmy,NTA and both of them are. Pretty pathetic that a pair of grown-ass adults with a six-year-old need their mom’s help to hold onto their money for them. They really need to step up for their kids.

~~I.N.F.O.~~ did she express great interest in moving here? Or was she more of the mind that this would be a temporary fix until she could get back on her feet and go back to her ""normal"" life?

If she was never thinking of this as permanent, I don't know how she could possibly be the asshole for wanting to go ""home."" Not sure it makes anyone an asshole, though."

czjifj,"NTA - move on and ignore them completely. 

It’ll be Everyone Sucks Here if you continue to engage them at their level. Just live your life and disengage from them. Don’t justify yourself to them and don’t attack them anymore either. They’re in the past and the past is over. 

And your friend who cheated on her fiancé deserved that."
czjvel,NTA - He's not offering out of real kindness but because he wants to come across as the good guy. What understanding could you possibly achieve with someone like that? He had no qualms about hurting you with his waffling and is on board with people who threaten physical violence. I'm really glad you didn't actually date.

czkcel,Bruh I don't know what you expected to happen with 1) dating your boss 2) ghosting him.
czkilx,"NTA. It sounds like you did everything you could, and the kid is mostly fine. Head wounds (even small ones) bleed a LOT. No one was intentionally trying to get blood on anything. Uncle sounds like his priorities are skewed."
czky73,"NAH. I can see both points of view. You don't have any sexual feelings for her so you find it ok to text her often for favors, etc. But I can definitely see how that could look suspicious to a partner. Just have your wife text the GF dude. Simple thing that will give your wife peace of mind."
czkysy,NTA- you do realize they’re still screwing right? It’s at least still an emotional affair.
czkz22,NTA. I don't think she knows what Introversion is.
czl6rn,"Why are you unmotivated to get a job after all this?

Go get a job."
czl8aj,"NAH, but not a great partner. 

You need to sit her down and tell her that her dismissive attitude make you feel unappreciated. Discuss how you’re scared to get her things, because you don’t feel like she likes anything you do. 

My advice? Get her a card with a thoughtful note about why you love her (at least 5 sentences). Those are the things you treasure."
czlasx,"YTA - Education is important to her - hers and yours - and you know that so you're lying to her. 

You don't lie to your significant other; trust is the foundation of any good relationship and you're showing that 1) you can't be trusted, and 2) you're willing to lie to get what you want even when it's not what your SO wants. 

I get that you want to spend time with her, but this is the wrong way to do it, and if she catches you, she would have every right to break up with you over it. If you're lying about something like this, how could she trust you not to lie about anything and everything else?"
czli5d,"NTA, whoever invented the 2-lane drive thru is the real asshole here... it's always confusing."
czlnwp,"YTA

I avoid people like that because to be perfectly frank you can't come around clowning grown ass people who are less knowledgable than 10 y/os. That's just pathetic and embarassing.

That being said if you decide to spend time with people like him or even be with him, you're obligated to not let that happen

Also, since he wanted you to cut your family out after such a short while of dating I honestly doubt that emotional intelligence stuff. Being sensitive isn't being emotional intelligent. That was a ridiculous demand I'd even say stupid"
czlpny,"YTA. If my partner suddenly had horrifying gas for an entire year I would be more concerned about supporting her in figuring out if there is an underlying health problem. Your focus on it being ""unattractive"" and something she should be able to modify per your preference makes you the asshole."

czlw5g,"NAH. It's reasonable for you to want time with your friends, but it does sound like a very tight-knit group, and she's making a genuine effort to get to know them. The old ""my friends don't want too many people in the group"" excuse is very high school."

czmbu8,"NTA. Its very simple, bring your own damn folding chair.  It can be understood not being prepared the _first_ time... but every time after that? Bullshit. 

But might I suggest a quick tactic to make you the hero and give you the moral high ground to refuse them your chair next time?

These folding camp chairs are what, $20-30 at your local big department store (Tesco, Walmart whatever) ? Really good ones would be $50? Get your in laws a pair of chairs. ""Here.  A present from both of us. Keep these in your trunk so you'll always have them handy!""  Now the problem goes away, you are a kind child in law who gave us such a thoughtful gift... and next time they forget the chairs and ask to borrow yours you can say ""Well, I guess you must have forgot the chairs I BOUGHT YOU FOR EXACTLY THIS PURPOSE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU"""
czmi5c,"NAH in this particular situation (you're not obliged to keep a conversation going with people you don't want to talk to, and you barely know this guy). But if you also do this to your friends and people you actually want to keep in your life, YTA. Nobody likes to be ignored, it's rude."
czmj8t,"NAH - Nobody needs to sit and watch an oven preheating BUT it is good practice to ALWAYS check the oven before turning it on.

czml16,"NTA for wanting to go alone. But sheesh, you are incredibly immature for your reaction to the first concert. You cried because it was completely ruined?

Uh...yeah going to say NTA if this is true.  That's someone using a therapy group for validation.  She could just as easily post to facebook or some sub-reddits wherever if she wants to fish for compliments.

You broke up years ago, you need to get the fuck over it and get over yourself.  If they want to invite your ex to the wedding, they can invite him.  It's their wedding!  Not yours!  They can invite whoever they want.  If you can't handle being in the same space as an ex for a few hours then you have a lot more issue than just being an asshole."

cznhql,"ESH. I hate the idea that just because someone died, they are now considered saintly. Sure, keep from trashing them in front of the people who were actually close to them and leave them to their grief, but it's okay to be honest and not memorialize people who were honestly just shitty people.

That said, going for his ex wife's name was just poking the bear on your part. You should have picked someone who was actually worthy of it on their own merit, not the merit of how much and who they would piss off."
cznkhs,NTA 100%. He is going to have a terrible time with this dog and a dog with those high of needs will suffer. Very selfish. He can always get a gsd later in life when he's in a better position for it.

czo2sv,"ESH, but the kids are more the AH than anyone else. Call the cops. Why has this not been done?! Report the theft and the names of the kids who did it.

czobr1,"So I am going with NAH - this really comes down to the politics of the office. 

IMO there are 3 reasons you go to a funeral (mix and match as required):

1) You need to grieve/say goodbye.

2) You would like to support the family in their loss.

3) You would like to honor the person's life or show solidarity.

Now as your post said, you did not know him well and this will be hard for you personally; my only caveat to you is to weigh the office politics of not going. If the entire office is going to go and your presence will be missed, *is that worth it to you?*"
czocry,"NTA- It's perfectly reasonable to request that he not watch TV in the same room that you are trying to sleep in. Especially given there is a living room TV as an option. And your comparison was a fair one- if you decided to watch TV while you got ready in your room in the morning, it would basically be the same thing."
czohzx,This is kind of silly....no one is an asshole it's just a diff of opinion?
czoin3,NTA - does your girlfriend has insecurity issues? I ask because i used to be that significant other that had to be on the phone whenever we weren’t together. It was due to lack of trust in my situation.
czoit5,NTA - But you should've called Animal Control instead. Essentially the same thing would've happened - do you know if where you left the dog is a no kill shelter?
czoj31,"NTA, you provided half. How you do so is irrelevant. Your friend is just trying to squeeze more out if you."

czoq7p,"NTA- your co-worker sounds mean and a bit entitled. I'm also a pushover so I probably just would of gotten the papers, but she doesn't have the right to boss you around if she's just your coworker.

**INFO?** However I'm also curious, why did she ask you to retrieve the papers? What was her reason for not being able to do it herself?

""Oh, are we not ready to order yet?  Well I'll come back later after you've had a chance to look at the menu.""

And every time they refused to tell me their orders, I'd repeat the same sickeningly sweet line back at them and make them wait another 15-20 minutes.

They can either order, or they can sit there the entire night and starve."
czp6em,"NTA. If it ever happens again, don't waste time arguing with an asshole like that. Just pull out your phone and call the cops. People aren't allowed to just park in the middle of the road like that and if he won't move when asked nicely, I'm sure he'd move once he saw you doing something about it. Or if not you could laugh at him when the cops get there and he gets busted."
czp70j,NTA. This was a harmless office prank with no malicious intent. Sue needs to take a chill pill.

You informed them that you can't work those hours.  You asked to be put on different hours.  They said no.  You left.

czpbb4,NTA. He could have just minded his own business from the start. It's not like you were parked in his driveway or something like that.
czpi2o,"NTA. And honey, as someone this happened to several times, your SO sounds like a prick. I had a BF that would not introduce me to anyone and it's because he didn't want me to be associated with him. If you guys are dating, and he won't introduce you as his GF, he sucks. He sucks for not introducing you properly, for not trying to include you, for not respecting your anxiety and sucks for yelling at you because of it. You were not rude. Good for you for sticking up for yourself when you were ignored and felt uncomfortable."
czpi86,"NTA, saying that someone has a white person name isn't racism. But honestly, this reply is going to get downvoted to hell and people are going to say you're the asshole. Your friend believes it's possible to be racist against white people because he's been influenced by white society and culture by being around us so often."

czpmki,"NTA -

How incredibly rude. You always. ALWAYS. ask for permission to use someone as a reference. Plus, this now puts you in an incredibly awkward situation. 

Here is one of the few situations where a little white lie is OK. 

""Sorry sis, I _did_ put in a few words with district on your behalf. But its a good paying job, they had a lot of really qualified people apply. Sorry, the final decision wasn't up to me.""... and don't mention that the work on her behalf was not to hire her. If it makes you feel any better, you are, technically working for her best interests: better for her not to get a job she isn't capable of, then to be hired, then humiliated when she's _fired_ for not being able to do the job. 

But absolutely NTA. Your reputation is at stake. It would be damaged if you made a hire recommendation and they turned out to be a dud."

czqf58,NTA. I speak from experience. At my old place of work we had a client who was schizophrenic and unmedicated. LONG story short she developed a fixation on me and was eventually banned. She continued to harass me and I had to go to the courts and fought hard to get a peace bond put in place against her. (She violated it immediately so the 1-year bond became a 3-year bond and she is now legally required to be medicated). I feel for her but her mental illness does not trump my right to safety. Same can be said here. You need to feel safe
czqgos,"NTA

If you bought it with your money. I have one too and only let people use it if my fiancee or I (both at least used to be professionals) are in the same room. Professional shit is expensive.

My mother is an emotional woman too - almoust as if she is still in the 20s. My only advice with such women - if its nothing really important - is not to care for their moods. 

You cant make your happyness depend on her moods. If she uses the silent treatment - good. Silence can be bliss. Youre a grown person. You have shit to do. Itll be over soon."
czqi1d,"NTA. She's being ridiculous. I am a woman and I have never heard of this rule from girl code. I bet they made it up.

You don't need the girlfriend's permission to get your friend a gift. It's not like you got him a sex toy.

czqrxv,"NTA. Your husband doesn't get to inconvenience you just because he's ""always had dogs"". If he's smart he'll start going above and beyond TODAY and FROM NOW ON to lessen your burdens with his dogs. Maybe then you'd be more amenable to getting more dogs in the future. If not though, you're within your rights to want a dog-free home for a while. Dogs are a lot of work, and not everyone wants that."
czqssq,"Info: Have you ever thought about why you didn’t take a picture of your beautiful bride? Like sure, there were cameras on her, but, were you never focused on her?

It doesn’t really matter what this sub says. That question is everything.

Edit: Grammar"
czqte5,"YTA. You wouldn't have been if you'd been polite about it, but getting aggressive with him was ridiculous. It sounds like you spend so much energy trying to be the 'fun boss' that you don't give actual feedback to your employees and then lash out inappropriately. That's being a shitty boss.

Also: It SUCKS to resent someone for using their vacation days. It's part of their compensation package. Just because others don't use it doesn't mean there should be some silent agreement that we're all automatons who don't need a break. If you need more notice from him or need to be able to say no sometimes, do so professionally and politely, but don't try to guilt him into not using the time he is completely entitled to."
czqw2v,"Whoa! Red flag on the field! So he’s basically saying, “If you really loved me, you would cancel on your friends and spend your birthday with me!” Well, if he really loved you he would not ask you to cancel previously made plans (while you weren’t together) and celebrate with you before/after your trip. YWBTA to yourself if you canceled a trip you were looking forward to."
czqy6d,NTA. I don’t think it’s sabotage to give your boss an honest opinion of the guy. A big part of hiring is finding someone who is a good fit for the rest of the team. You’d be more of an asshole if you had strong reservations about this guy and didn’t let your boss know.
czqyav,NTA. This is a parent thing. It's what parents do. You don't cover for a 16 year old kid lying to his parents about something like that.
czr1t1,"NTA. This guy is extremely careless with his business if he's letting potential clients go unanswered for multiple days.

czr4v1,"NTA - drunk driving isnt cool, period - for that alone 
your roommate is the asshole. I had a cousin who was killed when she was 18 by a drunk driver. Youre concerned for your roommates wellbeing, yalls clients and the public - that is very commendable. Depending on where you live you could be a mandated reported (people with disabilities are considered a vulnerable population) and are required to report suspected abuse (negligence is also abuse) source: I work w/ people with disabilities. I think going to HR is the right call or maybe a confidential complaint line if the company has one. Raise the concern without being 100% accusatory if that makes sense."
czr9s8,"NTA. Look do not call your aunt. It doesn’t matter what punishment your parents give you for this. DO NOT call your aunt and say “I don’t wanna do it”. Your parents are basically making you lie, because as you said you’ll get off the bus late anyway and you have homework. If your parents care soooo much about your aunts feelings and this man with cancer, they would go themselves. Do. Not. Budge. This will probably be the first step in them seeing you’re not a child anymore and that you can make these decisions on your own. Do. Not. Budge."
czrbd5,NTA. Who the hell does he think he is putting a *lock* on public patches of grass? You need to report this guy somehow.
czrd7p,"NTA. Your house, your rules."
czrdmc,YTA - she's your mother and it sounds like she doesn't respect your wife's wishes. You definitely need to take the lead on this conversation.

czrijj,"If you report him he will find another way to get it,and you will for sure lose a friend, which it sounds like he needs friends. I would remain being vocal about hating that he treats himself and his health so poorly

Is he smoking ciggerettes? I would also be concerned with his addiction to nicotine at such a young age. Does his parents know? Is there a way your parents could talk to his parents, maybe even on the pretense they snooped through your texts or something? 

If he's not smoking, you should send him the article that Juul is not for him. If there's stores that sell pods, you could ask them to not sell to your friend or this other person (if you could give them photos) for providing to minors 

I would for sure report the other person who is selling this stuff to minors. That's really fucked up."
czrjm7,"NTA - you get to decide who you are comfortable with having in your home if that doesn't include her that's totally reasonable. 

That being said I would consider that aspect of it when making plans, nobody likes being excluded and if their are other options besides your home maybe those are the better place to hold those get togethers."

You could’ve stood unobtrusively at the end of every section of the museum while he perused.

czrxif,YTA - it was right of you to be clear to HR that you weren't threatened by Rich but assuming Sandy doesn't have some long standing vendetta against you or Rich she thought she was doing what was best. She erred on the side of caution and you were a dick to her.
czs00o,"NAH--This is an incredibly mature way to handle it. You are supporting your friend and that's great, but you're human and it's ok for you to be disappointed that you don't get to go. The jealousy is a human thing. Try not to fixate on it too much. You don't want a decision neither of you took part in to poison your relationship.

It won't mean much, but I'm proud of you. That's a really difficult thing to do. Also, while it's great to have a career in something you're really talented with, that doesn't mean anything if it doesn't make you happy. If it's something you love, the challenge of it will push you to be better. Let yourself be sad for awhile, but remember tomorrow is another day and things will get better. These things are a part of life."

czsfbe,"NAH - not sure exactly how you get to the point of being married without learning how to say 

""Hey, that's interesting, but my brain's tired of cars - did you know they recently discovered new remains relating to the  Chimú civilization?  I was just reading..."" 

and continue to delve into the details of your archeology (or whatever) obsession, till your partner says. 

""Nifty.  But isn't it time for lunch?  Speaking of lunch, my favorite car to see at our local drive in growing up was ...""  

You: ""Lunch sounds awesome.  Ancient Incas are thought to have eaten XYZ for lunch...""

Best part of marriage - talking endless about your passions with someone who tolerates them ... but it has to go both ways."
czsg97,"NTA- you can’t be working in that field and stinking a room out. He implied smoking weed in your free time makes you less professional or approachable, while actually being less approachable or professional"
czsl6a,"YTA. You never know why someone hasn't been able to move their bins yet. The person could be out of town, sick, at work, and a million other reasons.

Super petty and immature."
czslwa,"YTA Joe isn‘t responsible for being in a group with 3, he tried to help set up the experiment and when he couldn’t help withdraw, since you didn’t gave him anything to do, and he tried to help, I feel like he should get the credit because he couldn’t help and receiving a 0 that is out of his control is just wrong."
czsstt,NTA. Unfortunately on conservative forums (including a lot of reddit) you will get attempts to undermine your sense of reality like this. A lot of people believe in reverse racism and sexism and have absurd interpretations of the dictionary or whatever to justify it.

cztha2,"NTA. Your wife is a monster and you should get a divorce!

J/K. But I was your wife and my husband wanted to murder me. I've come to understand that it's important to him that when he buys himself a treat, he can trust that it will be there when he wants it. Otherwise he ends up eating it faster because he's worried about it not being there, and also he saves treats for a bad day and bad day followed by 'my cookies are gone'=WORST DAY. So, he has his own stash that are his treats only and I don't touch them. I can buy myself whatever I want too as well as communal treats, we just communicate well about it.

Hands off the ice cream, OP's wife!"

cztks9,"I'm not religious either, but it's done out of politeness. Just say gesundheit or something else. It's just courtesy. If you choose not to partake in common courtesy, you can't be upset when people get offended. NAH. You do want you want, let others feel however they want."
cztszt,"NTA. I feel you OP, I had the room that shared a wall with the only bathroom for my three roommates. It was rough."
cztv4u,"YTA. You go on and on about how she’s dating an abusive, controlling jerk, but the thing you want to stage an intervention over is her pretentious pronunciation of IKEA? Dude. YTA."

czu5fu,"NTA - But next time, cover with humor. The dude was right, people like to be recognized as individuals. Next time make a joke about their outfits being similar today, or something to cya"
czu8vl,NTA. Tell your husband to get a grip. Maintaining friendships with exes (where possible) is a GOOD sign - it shows emotional maturity.
czuaow,"NTA. I didn't agree with Bush's politics, but it was your window. It's not like you were displaying something obscene.

Also there's just something inherently funny about big cardboard cutout people."
czuefp,"NTA. You earned this, it’s your right to choose how you celebrate it. (Congratulations, by the way.)

Honestly though, it makes sense that your family wants to mark the occasion somehow. I mean, high school graduation is basically the only coming of age ritual in mainstream American society (i assume you’re American?). Maybe you could get out of the surprise party by proposing something else to do, like a dinner at a restaurant where you only invite close family and friends. Or whatever you would find tolerable, I don’t know you. But it sounds like your mom at least is hellbent on doing SOMETHING, so maybe the best way through this is to focus on influencing what that something is."
czuejq,"YTA. I've been a hiring manager, and honestly that kind of nitpicky stuff isn't going to affect her job prospects for any job that isn't in something like editing or copywriting. What *will* affect her job prospects is being less confident in herself during the interview because of your comments."
czueqj,NAH sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to save some money. I don't see anything wrong with this as long as the shoes you are returning haven't been used. And if you did use them just buy the shoes online at the lower price and return those to the store with your receipt with the higher price.
czufk7,"NTA. You two agreed what your contribution to the household was, and it appears you met or exceeded it. She's not entitled to anything else based on you're living arrangement. 

You asked her to reserve a uhaul. She (possible made up and) gave you a price. You paid her. She absconded with the money, used it for herself, and leaves you without a truck or money. Then she laughed when you wanted the money she embezzled repaid. She's leveling up her asshole game here."
czuhtf,"YTA. I dont understand the people who get off on being rude to kids who have to go to the bathroom.

Edit. Dont bother commenting your justification for giving kids stipulations to go to the bathroom. If you think making a person hold their pee teaches discipline you can make your own judgement. I dont care about about your pee holding philosophy"
czujra,NTA. You have every right to protect the integrity of your home from drunkards.
czuoh4,"NTA

There’s a difference between being a part of your child’s life, and invading their life, and it sounds like your mother hasn’t found the difference between the two yet. You’re not an asshole for wanting your privacy, and she is an asshole for attempting to guilt trip you and misdirect you."
czupuk,"NTA.  You loaned it to him, you didn't give it to him.  It doesn't matter how small of a thing it is or how long ago you loaned it to him."
czuuzo,"Yeah YTA. It was an accident but you still did it. He’s out a scanner.

Perhaps offer this: to pick up the scanner, see if it works, look up the price yourself and order it somewhere you can find it on sale.

I would never give $ to someone I don’t trust but if it’s truly broken beyond repair (maybe offer to have it repaired?) he should be okay with you taking the damaged goods and giving him a new one."
czuvwr,ESH - You shouldn't have done that but in the long run you're both better off since he's now leaving you alone.
czuwj9,"NTA. It's really important to hold babies for long periods (there's tons of health and development benefits for the baby) but it's also important for their motor skills to have time on the blanket/floor and your back is reasonably going to need some breaks (so there's going to be some time in playpens/etc.). Age is also a factor (babies shouldn't really be left alone, period). 

As long as you're still pointedly spending a decent amount of time holding the baby and not leaving them totally alone, NTA for taking breaks.

czv0v8,"I’m sorry, this person texted you multiple times to tell you your boyfriend was cheating, you blocked her or shit down her throat every time, and then you got upset because she made fun of you after all that? Look, ESH. Your ex for obvious reasons, you for how you treated her, and her for saying mean things about your appearance."
czv7eq,"YTA.  There are a couple of things that make me feel like her being upset is reasonable.  She has to wait six months for her honeymoon, already making it less like a honeymoon and more like a regular vacation.  You didn't participate much in wedding planning, but are planning the honeymoon stuff.  While planning the honeymoon you decided that as part of your honeymoon to include something that you wanted but you didn't consider if she wanted at all.  So it comes across as you only did the planning so you can manipulate things to be how you want them. Visiting family would also add to making this honeymoon feel like a normal vacation.


If you had talked about how much you'd like to visit your family and you'll have no time off ahead of time, and then broached the subject of using the Baltimore cruise to do both I think she would've taken it better. Even if she didn't agree she shouldn't have gotten upset in that scenario."
czvary,"NTA that kid sounds like a little shit. Your parents also need to gain control of their own house. He’s a 14 year old kid, if he’s waking people up all night they need to take care of that."

If this guy is being a nuisance in your shared living space, you have every right to have a conversation with him about that. That said, your way of being a Christian isn't the only way. Trying to impose your interpretation of Christianity on him through the school's policies would be shitty on your part. And un-Christian."

Yes, and I think you know a majority of people here will agree. Your daughter is 14. She doesn't need your wife to helicopter parent her."
czvynn,YTA...you were asking someone to respect your son's medical problem but you weren't respecting theirs. Maybe use that as a learning experience for your son to teach him about other people's special needs as well. And definitely rethink allowing guests until it can be more accepted.

Share it on FB. You shouldn't have to change your life to suit your mum."
czwkse,NTA you have a right to the space as well. And it seems like you just want equality which is totally understandable.

Mostly for the reasons you explained. He's not acknowledging the obvious double standards.

czxmtn,"NTA. A group of 3 should be able to manage just fine without you. Contact your instructor and let them know ASAP what is going on with you. However, be prepared that your grade may take a serious hit if you can't meet the group project requirement of your course. It is still early enough in the semester that you can get disability accommodations for your avoidant personality disorder. I would recommend stopping by your DRS office as soon as possible to get that process started. 

However, a bit of advice from one anxious student to another - group projects are a part of the college experience, and they are always going to suck. You may be able to avoid getting out of this group project, but you won't be able to avoid them all. Instead of dropping out of the project completely, I would suggest talking to your instructor about your fears, and seeing if they have any suggestions for you. They may be more understanding than you think!"
czxojh,"Sounds like he might be suffering from anxiety? Obviously idk for sure, but a lot of people with issues like that think that anything that’s remotely mean (even in a joking way) make them really upset. Either way don’t tell him to “toughen up” that’s only going to make him feel worse and you would be the asshole. He obviously trusts you enough to open up and share his feeling with you, don’t mess that up by being insensitive:/"
czxrs0,"YTA - it's a bit of an overreaction to kick someone out for something a) not illegal or morally wrong and b) that you never explicitly said they could never do in your home. She was insensitive, but this is a bit much."
czxt8c,"NTA. She’s their mother and she should teach them to clean up after themselves. She should also take responsibility of her children and clean up the things her daughter obviously can’t. That’s incredibly frustrating and I’m sorry you have to go through with it.

Edit: The one year old, I get. Y’know? She’s a baby, but if the three year old is obviously capable, then she should learn to clean up. The clean up song can be lit af"
czy2pd,"NTA and her parents are. It sounds like you've given over and above already. You need to make sure you are OK too. Her parents need to be her caregivers.

You need to talk to her parents. One of the many times they text or call you, you need to tell them that long distance parenting is not working for their daughter and they need to come there or she needs to go back where they are.

She needs more care than any one person can provide and her parents are abdicating their responsibility"
czy3vi,"YTA- You seem to be a entitled to that car, but you are not. It is a gift your family got, so your parents, in this case, decide who gets it. You got your own car years before, and you chose to share with him, although he kinda abussed the kindess a bit."

czyt9k,"ESH. I do think you should have called, because when you're visiting a city ""an hour and a half away by train,"" you are expecting her to make a day of it. And she's been studying, so you were asking her to drop what she was doing and meet you, without having time to plan anything. But she also reacted very badly. All she needed to do was say ""I wish you'd given me some notice,"" or ""I'm sorry, I can't really spare any time today."""

czzeha,"YTA. I don't really understand why you're upset abut this. Your in-laws modified their basement so you could live in it, they let you pay only what you can afford in rent, and your MIL cooks ""many things you can safely eat, therefore modifying her entire family's diet to a certain extent."" That's very kind. You say you ""would never force your diet on anyone and would support your family if they wanted to eat more gluten products,"" but now it's your SIL's birthday, and your MIL made her daughter a birthday cake, and you're angry that she wasn't ""inclusive?"" This is very petty.

My mom has Celiac Disease, and while most of the time we try to accommodate her, sometimes it just doesn't work out, especially if it's someone else's birthday. She accepts this. Going without cake for one evening, on someone else's birthday, when they've all done so much to help you, would not have been difficult. You owe your MIL an apology, and you need to be more grateful in future."

Sticking to your principles would have just risked your niece having a more painful experience and infection. You pretty much got emotionally abused into doing it. Im sure your sister has bullied you like this before and trained you pretty well through your life to do what she wants.

czzye1,"YTA, throw your serial killer starter kit away."
d00180,"I'm going to go against the current here and say YTA.

I understand that in principle wanting someone to work sounds good, but the world is more complicated than that. I also think it's wrong to romanticize hardship.

It is admirable to put yourself through college with two jobs, but I feel like it should make you feel empathy and say ""I don't want others to go through that because it was tough"", not ""if I suffered a bit everyone should suffer some too"". You are already doing it by offering the scholarship, obviously, but you are assuming that everyone who doesn't work 20 hours or more isn't worthy of help. I disagree, because there's plenty of reasons why you can't work through college, AND sometimes wanting to do good in school should be reason enough. Also it's arbitrary to decide how many hours of school work people should put in, and you have no authority other than personal experience to decide whether or not someone has enough time to work. 

 You could put grade requirements to keep the scholarship, which would be more than fair, or add a money incentive if they are able to pick up a job, but if nobody is meeting the requirements, you might want to open your mind and consider that it's not because they are all lazy bums."
d001nm,"NTA - Do yourself a favour and just move out. You say yourself, you have two stable jobs. You don't need to live there. Try finding a flat in London or probably take a third roommate. Any of such arrangements is better than being financially exploited by the own mother."

d00jqf,"YTA You did kind of spoil the mood. Why did you even tell the lady that you can't afford anything there? Just say ""No thanks. I'm just here with my friends."""
d00jz0,"YTA, how is it that these are allegedly small bills but they’re also enough to “significantly” reduce what he owes you for the new trip?

I agree that in general it’s petty to nickel and dime your friends if you’re splitting things/paying for each other a lot. But if the amount is large enough that you’re miffed by taking it off what he owes you now, it’s completely fair for him to be miffed that you didn’t pay him in the first place. You forgetting to pay doesn’t absolve you (if anything it makes it worse).

Edit: phrasing"
d00plp,YTA. You've traumatized this kid to the point where seeing his parents together makes him breakdown and you're focused on her coddling him?
d00ugb,"NTA.   Drop out ASAP, and definitely don't invest your own money in this cavalcade of failure and irresponsibility.   If you have contact with the actors and production crew, advise them to do the same unless they're being paid."
d018rg,"NTA, you're never the asshole for not wanting to financially stick your neck out for someone.

First rule is never loan money to friends or family.  You give it to them flat out, or don't do it at all."
d019mo,"NTA.  ""Mixing family and business"" is when you have family members as customers to your *own* business. As in, your family would owe you money and that strains relationships.  That's not at all what's happening here.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with working for the same manager as your family member."
d01a97,"He knew you were doing him a favour? He's doing you a favour as well, don't forget that, he was going to be storing your stuff so you don't have to worry about it. You didn't set up a contract or anything, so eventhough it might be a bit shitty for you that you have to find someone else to rent the room; your roommate was not obliged to rent it in the first place. 

You didn't even try to find someone else. That's your mistake, not your friend's. If you really tried to find someone then it would be a different story, but since you didn't: YTA."
d01aq9,"So you broke up with your ex because she was literally using you, and you're wondering if it'd be appropriate to back out of an agreement made while you were being used.

Yes, it'd be appropriate.   NTA, your judgment at the time was operating using false information.  Keep your kidney.

Edit - Thanks for the double gold, y'all.  It's appreciated.  I'd be more active here, but I got nixed from the sub for a month.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Edit 2 - Hell's bells!  Double platinum, triple gold and silver?   Thank you all very, very much!"
d01dym,"NTA I'd tell her the next time i see her driving drunk im calling the police, and then actually do it."
d01or2,"NTA. 

>So I bought the tickets and all. Fast forward to a few days before my departure she says that a lot of people including friends and family have told her that I'm an asshole for leaving her and traveling without her when I could've paid for it.

Either she felt that way and hid it until now, which would make her an asshole, or the people she's talking to are assholes for thinking they have any say about when you're allowed to travel."
d01prr,"NAH

It's part of your job, in my opinion, to respectfully mention the students' needs with the instructor. As teachers, we need and want this kind of feedback, but often students are too shy to speak up and nothing gets solved, and things get worse."
d01yu5,YTA You CAN'T do as you please as long as she PAYS to be there. You are a landlord and you have obligations that come with that.
d01z0d,"Everyone is calling people who don't vaccinate assholes, but not because they don't listen to their doctors. Because their not listening to doctors affects the health of others around them."
d020hg,"YTA

Your kid is likely to find out sooner or later.  It's going to be better for him to hear it from you instead of finding out on his own."
d020py,"NAH. She can suggest and you can refuse. I think you're right that waiting with buying the tickets isnt really necessary. Like you said, you can always fly home if needed."
d023am,[deleted]
d028wg,"NTA. Very clear instructions not to do so, and you still got to put the stamp on something to remember."
d02bv7,"YTA she may have chosen for only a selected few to see these pictures, you being one of them. She has you on her Snapchat not your friends"
d02cas,"NTA - Your grandmother should have used her grandma magic on your uncle, not tried to guilt you into staying home."
d02d2b,">Especially since my fiance and I have been together for way longer,

this is irrelevant. youre nobody to be judging others people relationship and to pretend that yours matters more because its longer. 

>The other thing is that if they get married in 2020, we definitely will not be able to attend their wedding since we've already allocated all of our vacation time to our wedding/visiting my dad. 

NAH. you literally cant do much about this.

Edit: changed judgement to NAH cause the SIL and brother aren’t assholes."
d02gzo,NTA. That's low. It's not like she desperately needed a $1 lanyard and had no alternatives. I'd avoid going into shops with her. Who wants to be seen as the thief's friend?
d02kbg,"Dude go to HR. That is what they are for.

ESH"
d02tq8,"NTA.

Pretty presumptive of her to assume that people would pay for her to take up their space. Tell your mom that your sister will not be taking your space and if that’s their idea, you won’t be paying."
d02ukj,"I'm trending towards NAH. You have every right to set the terms under which you find your relationship acceptable and this may just be a previously-unknown incompatibility.

That being said, treating the completion of a degree the same as unemployment is a little weird. So is him quitting his job under the assumption you would support him without consulting you first. 

I'm definitely not a hard-and-fast advocate for marriage, but I wonder if part of the problem here is a matter of perspective. Not believing in marriage isn't the same as not believing in commitment and it's entirely possible that he sees this as investing in your collective future while you see it as him buying his future on your dime."
d02zxo,"NTA - it doesn't sound like you started a dispute, it sounds like you, an adult, were sharing an idea and your sister got upset. It's your money, spend it how you want.

It does kind of seem like it would be healthier for you to move out and get some space from your family."
d03243,"NAH - You were honest. I don't see that as a call out, just a reminder that he needs to be more thoughtful."
d033dy,"YTA, although you didn't directly give it away in your post.

> she causally mentioned that she knows I hate her (which is absolutely not true tbh, I'm just extremely annoyed but she didn't have any reason for me to hate her), and even though I immediately response along the lines of ""of course not"" and ""why would I"", and we later all dismissed that as a joke, my team members have expressed concerns over it, and kind of looked at me like a monster because who doesn't love a sweet girl like her. 

I think you're making your distaste known, even if you swear you aren't. You might not even realize it. But, the fact that everyone sees the same thing seals it for me. 

> I'm not sure if my annoyance towards her clouds my judgement 

Oh, it definitely does. 

> I have never been rude towards her, but is always politely distant despite her multiple attempts to chat or hang out with me. Whenever she tries to engage me in conversation or get me to join her for something, I would always just give the generic fake smile and reply with short answers that absolutely don't inspire conversations. 

At this point, you're doing what you said in your title. You're giving her the cold shoulder, more out of stubbornness than anything.

> I guess what I'm asking is, is it wrong off me to not make any attempt to friend someone even if I didn't ignore her and have even been respectful toward her? 

Problem is, I doubt everyone thinks you have a problem with this girl because you're being so respectful lmao. Come on. I've been there, being almost turned off by how nice and upbeat and supportive (or whatever) someone is because you can't fathom being that yourself."
d036io,[deleted]
d038j9,"YTA. Two reasons edged me to this decision:

1. You say it is because you want space (summary version), but then indicated you want to rent out the rooms. That’s not wanting space, that’s wanting income. 

2. The person you just began seeing shouldn’t get any say in this. The “ready made” family is your actual family and if this relationship is the real thing, your new SO will need to be on good terms with them for a long time. If you need alone time with your new SO, communicate with your sister and see if she can go out for a few hours with your niece. 

It sounds like you’re kicking your sister when she’s already down despite the fact that she seems like a good roommate."
d03ada,"NTA, it's not your responsibility to take care of your parent, especially during your 20s. It sounds like he's asking for more to cover his part of the bills/expenses but it's making it impossible for you to save for your future. I think the title is misleading but his finances should not be your responsibility. I would move out as soon as possible and begin saving money for your future."
d03di4,NAH - People quit. No business is owed an employee unless they're under contract.
d03eqs,"NAH. It's not like you did purposefully to strike a nerve, it was an honest mistake, but it doesn't mean that the parents can't feel bad about it. For the lunch lady thing: you probably made her day, imagine how it would be if she **was** the mother but you called her the grandmother?"
d03h84,NTA you dont owe anyone anything
d03lsf,"NTA your son did in fact learn it from his father. Part of moving on and rectifying shitty behaviour is owning the consequences of that behaviour. Even if it’s years later. Your husband might be annoyed you brought it up, but it’s the truth. He needs to own it, be honest with your son and apologize for setting a terrible example in that respect."
d03n8i,YTA parties r suppose to be fun; not suppose to use them as a way to manipulate people to satisfy your need for approval and attention
d03ncf,i would say NAH honestly. you're doing what works for you so people won't (ignorantly) think you're stupid. if it helps you then i say do it. it's hard to say someone who is using an accent to hide a stutter for their own peace of mind that they're in the wrong.
d03rof,"NTA - I dated a pathological liar,  found out that I had been lied to most of the 3 year relationship. He probably won't believe you,  I was told by an ex friend of hers who she was when we got together but I never believed it. Afterwards I texted that same friend and apologized though. 

Tell him,  if she chooses not to listen that's on him."
d03zxl,NTA - as someone who had situations with cancerous people in group projects like this I can tell you that you did the right thing.The only thing that would happen is that the shit he pulled off would repeat again.Doing this without him will be much easier for all of you.
d040al,">I hate having rings on my right hand, and I don't think they look good on any other finger than the ringfinger.

\+

>I haven't asked my partner about it, because A: I feel like I shouldn't have to ask permission to wear jewlery, and B: I'm worried what my partner would think.

= YTA.  

Sorry, but you are basically saying that your bizarre, oddly-specific aesthetic ideas are more important to you than your partner's feelings."
d041o1,NTA. No one is obliged to share their food. Is your sister okay? She seems unhinged
d045mc,"Dude you’re in HS. Your dad shouldn’t be breathing down your neck over a coding project at his company. He’s using you for labor. 

NTA. Focus on school. If he gets mad that’s on him."
d046ck,"NAH but I would recommend passing on getting a pedicure for safety reasons, you don't want to risk an infection when your toe is vulnerable."
d046fl,"FYI, ""Girl I know"" is his sister.  This is pretty important."

d04bo2,"NTA. when she married into a Russian speaking family she signed up to be around it.

I think it’s kinda’ rude she expects you guys to speak in English even if it’s more inconvenient for you just to be more convenient for her.
my ex boyfriend was Russian, it’s a beautiful language, Russian on brothers."
d04ebm,"NTA 

Also, I’ll be your new wife, as long as you’re okay with me having my own penis."
d04jmo,"NTA, seems like the only solution. I'm assuming you weren't hired as a fridge police so you don't have time to check which food is fresh which isn't, so after all the reminders to label their food it only makes sense to teach them this way."
d04n9z,"NTA. 
Frankly, she’s not your wife. Why isn’t she a dick for not wanting to go to New Zealand?
 
If you’re paying for it, spend the money as you see fit not how someone else expects you to spend your money. And she needs to grow up and talk about her problems not clam up and just expect someone else to fix them."
d04ni0,"NTA their situation sucks but they asked to borrow your car until the insurance paid them and the insurance paid them. Not your problem other shit happened and they can't use the money for the car.  
  
 What's going to happen is they will weeks/months later get that money from the government but be so backed up on everything that when the dust settles won't have enough money for a ""good"" car and will want to continue borrowing yours until they save up.  
  
The fact that they received the insurance payout and didn't tell you tells me they are planning to fuck you. Any responsible person would have reached out to you immediately and said ""hey the insurance company just paid us the money for our car but we are in a bad way.  Do you mind if we borrow the car for a few weeks more while we sort this out"""
d04o5k,"NTA

>  that friend wants me to give them a surprise prewedding photoshoot to win back their friendship 

And who asked for their opinion?"
d04obc,"YTA, you're extremely selfish for taking away your sister's opportunity to go to school later. Unless you're planning to pay that back? 

Taking out a $8000 loan for one year isn't that much compared to people having student loans of $100K+. Be a grown up and set priorities. Networking is important, so it should be ""worth"" the loan.

And yes. I have a student loan way more than $8K and working to pay that off rn."
d04ptk,"NTA: omg, she sounds sketchy as hell pushing for PoA. This whole thing is weird. If you think she cant keep her mouth shut then chances are she's most likely gonna babble about the amount of what she's gonna do with it as if it's hers. I would continue to keep it separate (mostly because I still believe in keeping finance separate after marriage with the exception of a joint account for bills). Have you asked her why she wants to be PoA? And why she keeps asking about it?

Edit: add on a prenup if you haven't."
d04qum,"You WNBTA, it’s a floral pattern and not a solid color, you should be fine."
d04ri9,"Sigh... NTA

She spent more because she had more - and that is in the past anyways. You do not owe her for taking you to the movies or whatever early in your relationship."
d04sio,NAH. Question: Do you think shes lazy or genuinely tired? When it comes to sharing household chores I think we need to be mindful of something more than sheer equalization of work.
d04tkm,"NAH

> I don’t know if not going is something he will resent me for. 

Ask him. Do you think he or C would feel better if you attended?"
d04tz9,"NTA. 


The only people involved are you, your sibling, and your friend. This is not some big secret on why your sibling ghosted them - it was directly related to friend’s actions. It’s entirely possible that he thinks it wasn’t that big of a deal and your sibling would come around, but that’s not the case.


You’re not really “betraying” your sibling by telling the friend the reason because they KNOW the reason.


I also think that it’d be a good occasion to let the friend know that this kind of behavior is unacceptable and some people will never forgive them if they keep acting like this - your sibling being the best example."
d052kc,"YTA, but not for the money. Whatever it is that's causing them to fail their background check makes them ineligible to work for Rover. 

From their site:

 All new sitters pass a basic background check

All sitters provide a detailed profile and personal information

All sitters are approved by our team of sitter specialists

You're allowing someone who failed the background check to work under your name. You are the asshole for committing fraud."
d059f2,NAH from your moms point of view you will always be her son/daughter coming to the realization that they can be independent can be hard for them she will still continue to love you and will not be upset forever.
d05b9g,"NTA, your ex needs to chill. A 2 year old isn't even going to REMEMBER an expensive cake"
d05cug,"ESH

You're both wrong, but that's the gaming industry standard, TBH.  You'll never get refunded, so it's best to cut your losses now.  I think some people are still waiting for certain canvas bags."
d05k3y,YTA. Grow up. Be in a relationship or don’t.
d05klp,NTA for avoiding him or his family. Sounds to me that if you started showing up in your brother’s life you’d basically be assigned the role of “next source of financial support once I bleed ol’ Dad dry.” So to heck with that.
d05mp0,"NTA - If you give in to the Lindas of the world once, they expect you to give into them always."
d05o4l,"Tough one, but ultimately deciding with NTA. The dog is a threat to your other dog. It is your moral obligation to keep both animals safe. With W in the picture, neither dog is safe.

That being said, I would absolutely 100% consider training before removing the dog from the household. Why can’t you train the dog or find someone to train the dog?

Edit: just to clarify, I believe if you do not even attempt at training the dog, you will be the asshole. Aggressive behavior can be stopped with training. I just think you are nta for considering getting rid of the dog if training for whatever reason does not work out (whereas it seems your SO wouldn’t consider that, making him TA in my eyes)"
d05o9i,"NTA, but I'd consider still doing it if it's not TOO much of an imposition just in case you or they want to have a relationship one day."
d05v2i,NTA. Seemed like you two were JUST wrestling. How could that even get sexual?
d05vmx,Real quick though what’s with all the anniversary posts lmao everytime I see one I keep thinking “is this one of the pissed off partners”
d061ja,"As someone who has played this stuff for 25+ years, yes, YTA.

The game is not yours, it belongs to the group as a whole.  No one person gets to make decisions about who plays and who doesn't, the group does.

You said 7th player, so there's 6 PCs now, which is already a large group.  Bringing in MORE players is an additional burden on the GM, and it means less spotlight time for all the other players.

You just don't do that, man.  Group activities require group input and approval!"
d0682n,NTA if they don't respond within 24 hours you're off the hook morally speaking. Just try to be sure you get your refund
d06a5n,NTA. She’s taking advantage of your kindness already.
d06arw,[removed]
d06c1x,"NTA, but dude you stepped in it.  The last thing you accuse a hormonal woman of *is being hormonal*."
d06ekl,"YTA if you stop speaking to a family member over a bracelet. Giving the gift was rude but it is seriously just a bracelet. The issue seems related to him being thoughtless, not malicious.

If you are tired of putting up with him in general then sure, stop speaking to him. I would do so because you're bothered by his general actions though and not over this specific incident."
d06fp6,NTA This is a dangerous and toxic situation for all of you and it must end one way or the other before someone gets hurt.  Protect yourself.
d06gss,"NTA. You were put in a tough position and you did what you could.

I'm glad he can be a part of the family now!"
d06j5r,"NTA

>I'd have to take time off of work to drive her hours to these conventions and watch our kids in a hotel room for days (because she wants the kids to be in some pictures).

Hell no NTA. If she wants the kids in some pictures, she can take them and be a parent at the convention. It's total bs to expect you to sit in a hotel room or find some way to amuse kids all day until she's ready to use them as props for a photo."
d06lif,"YTA. You don't know if those sex workers were trafficked, if they're being abused, if they're being pimped out by their drug dealer...

You can give him a handjob or a blowjob yourself, or he could just have a wank."
d06qdy,"NTA. normal for your MIL to want to be there for her first time at Disney, not okay to essentially bar you from being on the trip. that’s your daughter, you get to decide what experiences you want to be there for at that age."
d06rkv,NTA - he shouldn’t have been in contact with your property at all let alone again after you asked him go stop. You were within your rights to react as you did.
d06tpc,"NTA, ""don't like it? do it yourself"" definitly applies here. If they don't like that suggestion they are being a child. If that fails, give them an extra big laundry basket for all their clothes and wait until they whine that they don't have anything to wear."

d06wt3,"NTA. She’s making fun of a girl who’s having a hard time, and you’re just pointing out the hypocrisy of her statements"
d0721p,"NTA.  You blocking him doesn’t make you an a hole.  You have to take care of yourself first, and you can’t do that with a toxic person in your life."
d072qa,NTA. Explain situatuon to a supervisor/manager if possible for help. Generally most breaks for most employees are scheduled at the start of the day so people know when/how to work around them.
d074h8,"NTA. Though it only seems it makes things worse for you 90% of the time, since you said people don’t respond well, and you get even more frustrated. Doesn’t make you an asshole though."
d078ho,NAH - you are more than within your rights to end any relationship you're not happy with. She's also within her rights to be annoyed or upset by this news. Clearly she's not self aware how she treats others and why you have been her only friend. Maybe sitting down and talking through a few examples of her behaviour and saying that you need space because you don't think she's always a nice person to be around will be the wake up call she needs?
d078jy,NTA so your parents are perfect except for the fact that they make you feel like it’s your fault you were even born because you ruined their retirement years? What about the value of your time? This sounds like it belongs on r/raisedbynarcissists
d07bh5,"NTA

It’s the same as a diary. Those are private thoughts that you have written out and shouldn’t be held over your head like that."
d07cxm,"NTA

He didn't keep his word, but honestly, it seems you were leery he wouldn't in the first place. I would rehome your father."
d07ftc,"NTA- but side note, this shows that even women can show traits of toxic masculinity, you’re mum sees you have a boyfriend and assumes he MUST financially support you, whilst I agree it would be nice for him to do that, it shouldn’t be his job to do that, your mum said it like he has no choice"
d07gkk,"NTA. He is supposed to be the adult here. Screaming at his kid for not calling him back is not appropriate - especially if he didn’t try texting or leaving a message?? 

Also if he “had a whole weekend planned” it sounds like he knew in advance he wanted to spend time with you, so he should have checked with you and given you more notice. 

It sounds like he feels guilty about the state of his relationship with you and is lashing out by punishing you for his poor planning. That’s not okay. He’s supposed to be the mature one here."
d07gw4,"NTA that’s what principals are there for. He was being an ass for sure , write in pen going forward all my teachers hated pencil except for in math."
d07isx,"YTA. 
She’d essentially be paying your mortgage. She doesn’t get anything at the end of that, you do. 

It’s not the same as 2 people paying rent. 

Granted, she shouldn’t live there for free, but groceries and utilities makes sense to me. No fucking way should she be paying half your mortgage, that’s insane."
d07m9w,"YTA but also I can understand why. You're young and in a tough situation. But honestly, half your problems with her are reasonable requests. You're old enough to clean up after yourself and it's not unreasonable for her to want you to do it immediately. She probably shouldn't have commented on your mum but it sounds like you've been pretty bratty. Maybe she's at the end of her rope."
d07mxy,"NTA it was their fault so they should still send out the correct figure. You paid for something that you didn't get. File a dispute with eBay they usually side with buyers anyway. You have proof you didn't receive what you paid for.

Although sending something fragile like that just in bubble wrap and paper was risky in the first place."
d07nsd,YTA. Boyfriends who text gf's friends are creepy.
d07o6u,"ESH. Yeah, she's not entitled to taking your time when she didn't plan it out, but also she was just trying to be safe. Gotta give that to her, at least she was being responsible. Once you said you'd take her, I don't think she should've ran off and blown up on you though. Talking in a relationship is hard as hell without someone blowing something out of proportion, but try to talk it out. (I'm saying this from experience as we're the same age and my fiance and I also struggle with arguments. It's a work in progress.) Please make sure she makes it home safe, though. Too many drunk drivers take lives every day, and it's not fair to anyone."
d07pef,"NAH.  She may assume you wouldn't mind sharing things you already did to assist her in tutoring.  Of course it is up to you what you are willing to give her, if anything.  However, if I was in your shoes, I would probably tell her that you'd rather not giver her access to all your material because you are constantly reviewing and updating your course work but you would be happy to email her three or four basic lessons to get her started that she can expand upon on her own and modify it to fit her student's needs and pace."
d07qwf,"ESH 

Moving the cat that much can really stress it out and cause it to develop behavioral issues, so it is much better for it to be kept in a single home. Adjusting to a new environment constantly affects them both emotionally and physically since they have such sensitive noses and such.

However, I understand how the cousin feels as well. Would he be able to visit the cat a few times a week to keep up the relationship? Also the name is definitely not a big deal as cats usually just ignore their names anyway (in my experience)."
d07qwo,NTA you don't have to blow him if he doesn't go down on you.
d07s4x,"NTA I have done that in the past and I got the ""why do you not support woman blah blah blah"" And I said I DO and that is why don't want to see them being preyed on!"
d07vo8,Uh no. You don’t have to protect the feelings of creeps who insult you. NTA
d07vxh,"NTA If she wont pay extra for the cats, that is entirely her problem."
d07ykc,NTA . Run
d07ypz,NTA. They’re mad because they’re fucking stupid.
d07ywz,"He shouldnt have broke your phone. He paid you the ""value"" of the phone. What you do with that money is up to you. 

NTA"
d082qs,"NTA financial favors every week add up fast. If you can’t afford it, you can’t afford it. Stop giving her money- and make sure you and your husband have a United, canned answer: “we can’t afford that, SIL”."
d0865i,YTA - public libraries are a place of refuge for a lot of socially awkward people and there is usually enough space for them to live and let live without infringing on others. You could have moved yourself.
d08a5y,YTA- you should get a separate freezer for this. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to store your food in the same freezer as roadkill remains.
