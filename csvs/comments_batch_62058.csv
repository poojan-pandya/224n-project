d08ojm,"It's not legally yours. As you clarified in a comment your father didn't leave a will. If he and your mother were legally married his stuff is legally hers, not yours. It's up to her what she wants to do with the car. 

Also, owning an expensive car is not just about how much it costs. Can you afford the maintenance on this vehicle? Can you cover the insurance and gas costs on your own? If not, then it needs to go.

But overall, it's not your choice.

I’m only saying because not only did you do nothing for the group, you did nothing for yourself.

d095pt,"NTA. That woman posted to a closed group believing it was a safe place to discuss whatever it was she was posting about. You would have been a huge asshole for sharing her post with your boyfriend so he could use it for gossip fodder, and he's even worse for using that bullshit ""intimacy barrier"" line to try and manipulate you into doing so."
d0973l,"YWBTA if you ghost him. 

Either 

A. Set clear boundaries before proceeding in a clearly defined relationship 

or 

B. Tell him you Felt uncomfortable with being called hun given your history and you wouldn’t like him to contact you again. 

I think it would be best to provide some sort of closure or give him the opportunity to approach the relationship differently all over again. 

Either A or B would be NTA ways to handle the situation. Although it’s entirely possible A merely delays B. It’s not uncommon for men to reach out to women they haven’t talked to in a while hoping to cheat with them."

d09jzr,"You see, to you things are clear cut. You said that the church did NOTHING bad to your sister, but that is because you are, in this case, part of the problem. I was formerly agreeing with you, and then I read the second half:

&#x200B;

> "" the community is being passive aggressive with my parents, particularly my mom.  ""

A religious community is one that shares a devotion, not that judges other members, MUCH LESS that acts passive aggresive towards them.

>"" There's some shame involved ""

Shame about the decisions of a free adult.

>"" they've made it clear my mother has failed my sister ""

And they are bashing the person they can influence.

> ""My sister's in a homosexual relationship now, has tattoos, et cetera,  things the church doesn't really see in that great a light. ""

This here implies that neither the community nor you (as you don't even question it) is particularly tolerant.

&#x200B;

Now, all this leads me to think that your community is great **as long as you don't disagree with them nor have any ambition they deem ""wrong"".** You are talking about your experience as a member that's never had an issue with that. From your (biased) words alone, I can tell that said community has been extremely nasty towards your sister, both in emotional coercion and in indoctrination. **It's healthy for her to leave.**

&#x200B;

If you look onto it a bit more deeply, you will notice one more thing:

  
Your family is holding their love hostage.  


""Either you obey this faith community rules or you are not welcome or loved in our family"". Even you, who wants ""the best"" for her, are equating being in the family with being in the sect. And, once again, you show that you are pretty much aligned with this way of thinking, because as much as you say you don't blackmail, your parting line is this:  


> We'll never be a complete family if that's the case. 

  
Please ponder about it. Ask yourself wether you use every time your sister talks to you to try to force her back into a community that deems her most natural insctincts ""evil"" and ""sinful"" and that preaches self loathing. Is she really pushing YOU away, or just the religion?   


TL;DR: The faith you talk about has been shitty and borderline abusive to her, she did the right thing leaving, and now your family is telling her that the only way to be accepted by her blood is to go back to the sect that deems her ""sinful"" and ""evil"" and that wants to condition her whole life.  


TL;DR of the TL;DR: YTA."

I'd be mortified at the idea of doing this to *anyone* invited to my wedding, no matter how distant we were. If you're going to ask someone to be a guest at your wedding, treat them like a guest. Cheaping out like this is beyond tacky.

This isn't a circumstance where the bride/groom only invited their closest friends and family, either: everyone in the ""quite large"" social circle got an invite to both the wedding and reception except this girl. I'd rather not be invited then to be singled out like that as the only friend not to get one. You don't do that to friends."

d0ezsa,"Thought I’d just chime in with a caution. Huntington’s is a fatal DOMINANT genetic disorder, so your spouse has a 50/50 chance of developing it later in life as well. 

Try to imagine how your MiL must be feeling: to watch your husband slowly dying and losing himself, and then being forced to nurse him through the agonizingly slow process of watching this thing without a cure take him away piece by piece. Imagine the loneliness, to watch your partner through life slowly break down and to be the only one to take care of him through it all.

And now try to imagine someone in your family naively suggesting you give up your JOB which is not only a small comfort, but is likely used to make up for some of the difference in loss of income and supplement the government checks that don't pay all the bills, thereby giving up even more of your emotional and physical well-being to this disease.. all without even extending the offer of helping out themselves or working with you to find other programs or sources of aid first.

He also might not have been responsible for overdosing your friend. You don't know what he did the last 3 years, so it's not your business to break that to his girlfriend."

When someone asks if you can turn it down then you should turn it down. 

Also just a little side note I would recommend not listening to your music full volume as that can contribute to hearing loss when you get older. And you should get noise cancelling headphones if you’re that bothered by background noise."

Sure, I'm groggy and a little irritated at life in general in the morning, but treating anyone like this is way out of line. 

That said I picked ESH because your husband *really* needs to respect you when you say you're not up for a conversation. The fact that you form a work schedule specifically to avoid him is a major red flag that he doesn't respect your need for a little space and that's a big problem on his end too.

Mother isn’t the asshole, because she called based on misinformation from her own daughter, but it’s a bit naive of her to think (even if you guys broke up amicably) to come to an ex’s funeral after so much time has passed by.

Edit: I’m adding here that the based on the misinformation her daughter told her, she probably was misinformed of their relationship now. So it makes sense why she made the call to OP"

It's perfectly normal to want to keep some stuff to yourself, you're 15 and you're figuring out not only how the world works, but how you fit in it as well, so it's natural to feel that you need to keep some things to yourself. 
My parents never insisted when I didn't want to share things with them, and I was a very secretive and weird teenager. I always respected that they allowed me to make mistakes and let me suffer the consequences. All they did was give advice, but let the decisions up to me, which I think is a very healthy thing to do and as a result, we didn't grow apart, and we have a rather healthy relationship, at least compared to what I see happening with other people. 
I understand your mom too. It's sometimes tough to see someone that came out of you as an actual person, and not a tiny baby, but everyone needs boundaries and everyone has the right to set them however they see it fit.

d0ic05,NTA. You rented the place for 5 weeks and that includes a right to quiet enjoyment of the property. If you’d agreed to this at the start then You’d be an asshole but you didn’t.

d0iiqp,"NAH. I assure you, your boss would fire you without hesitation if a better labor/work offer came along.

> I saw my boss working the kitchen because our morning guy called out this morning and I could tell he was struggling but he kept a high attitude and greeted me with a smile.

Think about this. You've been asking for more hours. Here you are, walking in seeing that your owner has need for labor help and he doesn't even offer to let you hop on and earn some extra cash even though he is short a worker. He would rather smile at you than let you earn more income."
d0ikp3,"NTA.  

You've left notes and tried to talk to him.  Since you rent, you may want to ask the landlord to deal with it but at this point calling for a tow is fine.  They've been warned."

d0iydz,"NTA. I never understood the lying about your height.

I'm a VERY short man. Ain't nothing changing that so why lie?"

d0j0zj,"ESH

If you can’t trust someone, and can’t communicate openly, you’re both wasting your time."
d0j4gs,"NTA.

Why would you tip the conveyor belt?"
d0j4js,"NTA. I don't think you're caring too much, the teachers have made a mistake - maybe they misplaced the clothes, or they gave them to someone else - and they should do everything in their power to retrieve them. Even if they couldn't do anything about it, they should at the very least apologize for it."
d0j4uc,"NTA, and I don't mean NAH. I can't stand when people defy the basic logic of attraction in favor of romantic cliches. Yeah, she might be a great person. No, you can't tell that from across the room before you get to know them. The first thing you'll notice about someone is their looks. It's pretty simple."
d0j6cl,"EDIT: NTA! At this point I would just tell him hes way off base and ask for a refund, if they aren't going to act like a professional, they shouldn't be paid like one.

INFO:  How far off is the artist? Is it an entirely different topic, just not artistically what you were thinking, or is the coloring just a bit wrong?  This could swing both ways pretty easy. 

When I commissioned as similarly priced painting, there were a few iterations of concept ideas, then two iterations of sketches prior to the final painting being done.  The lack of communication from your artist is concerning."
d0je1z,"I""m going with NAH

Being friends with somebody ""needy"" and being roommates are two different things.  I can't blame her for not being able to deal with it.

I don't blame you either.

Now, while I don't think you're the asshole, you might very be the ""legal asshole"".  Whether she's on the lease or not, she's probably claimed residency at that address since she moved in.  She probably has tenant protections.  I don't think you can just go and kick her out, there's probably some steps you need to take first."
d0jhcv,"NTA- it’s a small thing for her to change that would make patients more comfortable. As a society, we should stop assuming all women want or will have children. All she has to do in the future is say “if” you plan on having children in the future, here’s what you need to know."
d0jm81,YOU NEED TO TELL YOUR MOM!!!!!!!!!! Seriously. If my soon to be husband was like I would want to know to protect my children. You and your sister need to sit her down together and talk to her about it. This is not okay. It almost sounds like he’s in it just for the money. Have your mom contact her lawyer to maybe revise the prenup/will that states that he is forfeiting the right to ever fight this in court and that he is not entitled to any money what’s so ever other than what she leaves for him.
d0jr0l,"NTA. Ever heard the expression ""not your circus, not your monkeys""? He has created the situation, it's his job to talk to his girlfriend about it. He's for some reason trying to put responsibility for it on you. He's an adult."
d0jr9z,"Lmao. What. NTA. You’re not a homewrecker, that home was wrekt probably long before you even dared exist in their orbit."
d0jssy,"NTA While it might be inappropriate to begin with, the woman sexually harrassed you. Even if you were wearing boxers she would have touched your privates. She is a horrible person."
d0jtl0,"NTA In this situation, it’s really her place to decide if she wants to talking to you. It’s her toxic bf and her relationship with you. If it comes down to a situation where it’s you or him, sounds like he is a little bit of a dick, she’d be better off without him."
d0jwpx,"ESH. Clearly Tom is the worst person here, by a million miles. But, you don’t get any say in what your BF’s company does regarding Tom at work. You absolutely can and should draw a line at any social interactions outside of work. I’d tell your BF that Tom is no longer a friend, no longer welcome to store his motorcycle at your house etc. Anything outside of work is fair game and you should insist on it."
d0jww9,">	He tells me that he feels like I prioritized this guy over my promise to him, and said that if he ever cheated on me and I decided to forgive him, he would never take a chance on losing me so he could help the other woman ""with an ouchie.""

He’s right. YTA. I can’t imagine how he felt coming home and seeing you alone with the man you cheated with."
d0k1ua,"NAH, He wanted the dog so he should have his responsabilities.
Actually, you're doing a great job.
I hope for you it will get better and he'll understand that it is also HIS dog and not only yours, or maybe he'll discover it himself when the dog won't listen to his words"
d0k398,"NTA. He should have knocked. And if he texted her, she could have communicated that with you."
d0k4sc,"NTA - your coworker is taking this the wrong way, why should she be the one to be bumped up? Both of you have anxiety about flying."
d0k60c,YTA - he had to wait two weeks because of your physical issues and you're upset over him being tired for one night?
d0k6rp,">Then he called me a fucking bitch and a fucking asshole

That escalated quickly!

May I suggest a divorce?"
d0k9el,"I'm going to say NAH. I don't think you're wrong for being concerned, and your points about medical intervention are good. Your sister needing an emergency c-section also probably contributes to how vehement you are, in your disagreement. Your wife is also not wrong for wanting a home birth. They are very common, and it's not super insane for her to want one. However, you cannot exactly ""put your foot down"", or ""not let"" your wife have a home birth. Like you said, it is her body. Ultimately, she gets to decide what to do with it."
d0kcnv,"YTA. Would you be cool with your gf ""staying the night"" at her ex bfs house? Didn't think so.

I honestly don't believe you went over and ""just talked"" with no physical intimacy whatsoever."
d0kdhv,"NTA, it's common courtesy to clean it up if you miss the target."
d0kees,"Honestly right off the bat NTA, you have the right to choose who to invite to your wedding, and if Cameron isn't part of that then that's your right and your choice because its **your** wedding."
d0kghz,YTA - He cheated on her with you and now you’re not going to let the girl he was with originally to grieve? That’s wrong
d0kgss,"NTA. He is completely your child and not hers. It's good for them to have a relationship, but it is all your decision. Splitting weekends like you have shared custody is an infuriating suggestion."
d0kipn,NTA. Deanna should be responsible for the vet bills as it was her fault your dog got hit. The fact that she didn't apologize or help out is absolutely ridiculous.
d0kj24,"YTA. You can ask for whatever you want, and will likely get it because of the nature of fast food work, but it would make their lives unnecessarily harder, and would definitely make you ""that customer""."
d0kj4x,"ESH. He sucks ass for keeping if from her, but you are NOT ALLOWED to out someone. Absolutely not."

d0l7pg,"NTA

So long as you don't forbid your fiancee to hang out with Mike. Have you talked with your fiancee about your concerns?

Mike has his troubles and unless Mike wants to seek the help for his drinking he will continue to drink, know that."
d0l7t8,"NAH. Umm, no, why would this be a problem? You and your wife should both have atleast $40 per week to spend on yourselves. Probably actually a lot more to be honest"
d0l95d,"NTA.

This is the correct response after a friend’s dad has a stroke:

“Oh my God, that’s awful! I’m so sorry! Are you okay? Can I bring you dinner/a hug/a change of clothes? Don’t worry about the wedding. Focus on your dad getting better.”

This is NOT the correct response after a friend’s dad has a stroke:

“Are you abandoning me? Hahaha lol. I’m just kidding. My coworker had a minor stroke a few years ago and also I’m stressed about my wedding, so no big deal, right? Hey, you’re still coming to my wedding, though? Because no pressure, but you would be the LITERAL WORST PERSON EVER if you pulled out of MY SPECIAL DAY.”

Your ‘friend’ and her fiance truly deserve each other. Drop out with no regrets. And maybe, on the day of the wedding, take a short break and get a massage or something. I hope your dad feels better and you make sure to take care of yourself."
d0lcmn,"What does it matter that they can't speak English? They know what a decent human being looks like. I think the only excuse for this is if they were non-verbal due to intellectual disabilities, and even then its suspect.

No one has an excuse for getting physical with you at work. NTA."
d0ld46,NTA. Ann is making decisions that impact your life and not her own. She isn't going to pay for the adjusted rent so her excuse is pretty hollow. You should start looking to move out if you need to.
d0ldm3,"YTA. I wasn’t going to say so at first; you’re not risking them anything, even though as a former barista, yes this is annoying. Whenever this happened I just called the drink itself instead of the dumbass name.

But then when you go and make them do it not just once, but twice, now you’re wasting somebody’s time for your own amusement who’s just trying to do their job. For all you know that person’s been standing on their feet for 10 hours and now they gotta deal with some clown insisting they shout Twelve Raccoons In A Suit at the top of their lungs just so you can get a laugh about it. Power-tripping makes YTA."
d0le3e,NTA. She'll take advantage of you if you allow it. If she was that worried about getting to work she would've started walking by now
d0lfmm,NTA - it would of been nah but you’ve established a pattern of selfishness on his part
d0lgxa,"NTA the kid wasn't mad and seemed to take it the right way, so why would you apologize?  he would just floss on you or something"
d0lkn3,"NTA. SHE cut you off first. And if she hasn't expressed any desire to want to talk to you, why do it?

If you go against her very clear wishes, then you'll only make things worse.

edit: I can't spell"
d0lpvl,[removed]
d0lqaa,"NTA. Let me get this straight. She’s upset that you hung out with her roommates? Not her boyfriend, her roommates? Something is fishy with regards to her feelings about the situation. 

That being said, it’s probably for the best to not discuss banging her roommate at this point."
d0lqpi,"NTA

But you could've tried to call 911 and explained your situation that would've probably been the best way to handle it but still you have a good heart for helping out the poor dog."
d0ltbp,"Honestly,  it wouldn't hurt to call the GM, verify everything with your lease is ok, and inquire about what you believe is a duplicate check?"
d0luvo,"YTA for telling them that you tested them and they failed. If you do something like that you keep it to yourself. Nothing good is going to come from saying ""well we gave you a little test you didn't know about and you're not up to snuff"".

I don't know what they asked for help on but there are lots of things I'd figure out on my own if alone but no point if a parent is home. I might ask where diapers are or bring a crying baby to Mom if I thought it needed feeding. Doesn't mean I'm not to be trusted alone. 

You get to leave your kid with whomever your want and if you want to set tests fine but don't be surprised when people are offended that you are rejecting their offer of help because you found then wanting."
d0lv3w,"NTA
My sister tired the same shit with my wife and I, it wasn’t even a second thought to confront my sister on her bullshit. Now she had been in a constant mad state at us but my bride is worth more. 

Your husband needs to step up for you to his entire family (believe me it was hard and uncomfortable)  if not your marriage is going to be ROUGH"
d0lw0r,"***READ ME OP*** I also have clinically diagnosed OCD (pure cognative). so I really feel you and understand these anxieties are not rational. With that said YTA to yourself and your gf. Giving into anxiety compulsions is the #1 to make it worse. You're never going to improve until you force yourself to face your anxiety. YTA again to your gf since she now lives with you and you're essentially grounding her from having friends over, you can bet she isn't going to stay with you if you don't figure out a compromise."
d0m006,"I’m gonna take a position that might be controversial, YTA. The chances of your children being in a school shooting is extremely low. 200 children have died in school since columbine, out of the 50 million in attendance each year. Statistically, you’re more likely to die from a disease or a sports related injury than getting shot in school. I understand that you’re afraid for them, but pulling them out will cause more harm than good since as I said it’s extremely unlikely that anything will happen to them."
d0m0ni,"NTA. Why are you still giving money if you know it's not getting paid back? They keep coming to you because you give them what they want with no consequences. I wouldn't bother asking what it's for - just tell them that they don't get another loan until the first is paid back.

Or, you could try to help out (I'm assuming you actually do want to help them) and offer to help them figure out a budget that makes their income work. Try to help them actually diagnose what's wrong instead of giving them money to continue on like there's no issue."
d0m1d3,For a single player game?  Who cares/cheat all you want. NTA.
d0m4w4,"NTA, you shouldn’t feel obligated to help him out. First, if the guy was going to shoot him, he would’ve right then and there. Second, he seems to have taken advantage of your kindness entirely. He’s got no respect for anyone. Out with him."
d0m7ks,"NTA. But I'd call him out first and tell him to stop talking about her like that. Telling her will help her, but he's just going to talk that way about the next girl he dates. The problem is obviously with him, not her."
d0mg7p,"The couple might think you're an asshole for a second, but you aren't asking for your money back so NAH... I wouldn't mention seeing your friend and focus more on school as the reason. I would also send a gift bag with your BF as an ""I'm sorry"" gift (I suggest a bottle of Champagne or tequila and some Tylenol packets, Pedialyte or LiquidIV packets, junk food, water, etc - general hangover items that you can get from a Drugstore, but shows you thought about it). I would also reach out to the girl who is supposed to be decorating with you & personally let her know you can't make it -maybe see if there is anything you can do ahead of time (like assemble banners or organize gifts or anything to make her life easier)."
d0mheh,"NTA. I’m a professional career nanny. I have a clause in my contracts with families that essentially says that I’m 100% okay w cameras, but they must all be disclosed and pointed out to me upon getting them. Any cameras not shown to me is grounds for me immediately quitting with severance paid out. The reasons are b/c:

1. If baby spits up (badly), or has a massive bout of diarrhea, and it gets on my shirt - I’m now in damage control mode. My first concern is of course baby, and second concern is containing the mess. So I might quickly whip off the dirty T-shirt and put on my new one from my nanny bag. Imagine if there was a camera I didn’t know about that I changed in front of. 

2. There’s a nanny in my community who found out that her bosses showed a video of her picking a wedgie as a joke to their guests (presumably drunkenly) during a house party. Probably wouldn’t have done that in full view of the camera had she known it was there. 

3. If I need to make a phone call to my doctor/pharmacy/whoever during nap time, my PHI is something I don’t want recorded and stored. 

Again. I’m fully okay w cameras. In fact, I encourage them. But I need to know where they are so I don’t accidentally flash the camera or tell you the brand of my birth control. 

If you’d like info on being a good nanny boss, feel free to pop over to r/Nanny. I’m a mod over there!"
d0mn4d,"I’m going to be the oddball out and say NTA. Your cousin sounds like she’s having symptoms of victims in abusive relationship and can’t bring herself to defend herself against him. So it’s about time someone else stepped in and gave him a taste of his own medicine. This is your cousin, your family, you’d be a coward to not speak up and defend her. 

Matter of fact he got off easy imo. I know if a guy tried that in my family he’d be getting his ass whooped by all the siblings and cousins."
d0mnpw,"NTA. You chose a chair together so it would be safe to assume that the one you picked is the one you want, so why would he get one that's basically the opposite?
I would just make it clear that you had a specific one chosen and that's why you want it returned, not because you don't appreciate it."

d0mskl,">she started policing my appearance by throwing out or destroying clothing she deemed too masculine (including most of my pants), refused to allow me to cut my hair and *charged* me 50$ for getting a haircut behind her back (hair length before the cut was below my ass, after it was a little above my jaw, I was 17), *performed body checks to ensure I shaved everywhere (and yes I do mean everywhere. She made me strip down to Adam’s robe and show her my shaved genitals from 15 on).* That’s only a few examples.

WHAT THE FUCK

NTA

And your coworkers sound awful, too."
d0mujp,"NAH. Your mom's right that telemarketing employees are human (minimum-wage workers, usually, who often don't have much by way of job options) and deserve to be treated as such. They are not, however, entitled to your time. Hanging up unceremoniously isn't unusually *polite*, but for unsolicited sales calls, it also isn't rude. Rude would be resorting to verbal abuse, as entirely too many people do.

Your mom clearly has a slightly different threshold of acceptable respect than you do, and that's okay. Hopefully she can come to understand your position as well."
d0mvrf,NTA- there’s a saying turnabout is fair play. She started this war lol not your fault she was the only casualty lol
d0mwge,"NTA. Your husband seems to be *very* bad with money. You can buy with your own money whatever you want, and you aren't obligated to bail out anyone else, specially if you alredy helped them before."

d0mz5d,[deleted]
d0n038,"Nope, you are NTA.  You're in the friendzone my friend. You have every right to start distancing yourself. I think it would be extremely healthy for you to do this. It would allow you to focus on other friendships and relationships, and possibly find the right person for you. It isn't her and while she may be just trying to not hurt your feelings by not saying ""no"" outright, she is still stringing you along. Move forward and let go."

Your wife is just ignoring the issue and hoping it will go away. You need to speak with an attorney and protect yourself.

d0n9on,"NTA if they are literally parking on your lawn. If it was just the public street, I would say tough, public is public. The dog thing shouldn’t factor in, it’s on you that you trained a dog to bark at people and then moved to a street full of people."
d0natj,"My vote it NTA. BUTTTT talk to your older son first and have him talk to his wife. It's their wedding, let them decide. Assure them that you are okay with either response and will support kicking him out if he acts up. Best of luck."
d0nc5j,"NTA

She's being selfish. You should take your friends and have a good time because even if she goes you know she's going to be a killjoy."
d0nci3,"NTA - tell them *politely* that it’s not nice and to knock it off. Otherwise, you need new friends."
d0ncut,"You'e upset right now, and rightly so, but don't be in a hurry to quit. You can always quit later but you can't un-quit. Go look for a new job.

d0ntv7,NTA. This whole thing is way more trouble than it's worth. I'd bounce too.
d0o33s,"YTA plus you were just as gross as him if you ""shook"" it, zipped, and then opened the door without washing your hands."
d0oiqk,"NTA. You don’t have to hang out with someone you don’t want to. Ghosting is kinda shitty, though, so maybe him seeing it in writing would drive the point home. Text him back saying you don’t want to hang out with a drug addict and block him."

d0om6r,"NTA: make sure to get every single legal document and legal process under your name so your brother doesnt try to pull some shit. He is doing exactly what yall think he is. Sticking around to run off with his entitled ""share"". Get the legal work done so he cant touch any of it.

You have no obligation to withhold any information. You don't have to make flyers about it and drop it from the sky, so to speak, but your experiences are yours to share with whomever you choose. She made her choices and you make yours. That's how life works."
d0osop,"NTA- why is it your job to take the high road on your wedding? isn't it her job? if the family cares so much why aren't they getting on her for how she's acted? I'd be side eyeing your parents hard. If family comes first, why doesn't anyone care that your sister is horrible to you?"
d0ot3m,"NTA. Honestly, she sounds like a nightmare. Also, I've worked in customer service. After a long week, you just want to be alone for a bit. You're not alone, we all feel that way. It sounds like you're in a really tough position. The first thing you should do is talk to your sister. Just explain that work is taking a toll on you and you need alone time on your weekend for your mental health. Hopefully she respects your needs."
d0ot9d,"NTA, if she comes to visit, the $1200 you are saving a year is more than enough to pay me to carry her up and down the stairs."
d0ouaf,"NTA. 

>We started this practice so I can have a ”break” - during this time I pick up the house for the evening, [do a lot of other house chores]

Dear, that is NOT a break.  A break is when you don't have to keep working and doing everything for your baby.  Is he going to take care of the house chores, dinner, walking the dog, getting other baby things together while you feed the baby?  

Not a parent, but I hear that it's very valuable for fathers (and other non-lactating parents) to do baby feedings for bonding time.  If he's only seeing feeding at ""giving you a break"" [to do other housework] then he seems to be missing out on a lot of that value and should reassess his priorities and the quality of his own parenting."

d0p2y9,nta. but girl sure is streetwise! she ignored you. Probably she can handle herself.
d0p3uz,"There’s nothing wrong with wanting a girl, but the way you talk about it is a little weird tbh. Won’t your boys look to you for ‘comfort, protection and advice?’.

d0p69k,Your mother's power tripping
d0p997,YTA. you're not the asshole for asking but people with kids don't automatically come first and people without kids shouldn't automatically be expected to accommodate those with kids. Obviously he's already stated he has no other obligations outside of work so that's different but if they offer a flexible schedule everyone should be able to take advantage of that not just people with kids.

d0pibb,YTA.  Everything your girlfriend said was correct.  Leave your computer at home when you're at work.
d0pl20,NTA. That is why you mute or turn off your phone during an important event.
d0plek,"YTA - you are not his wife's keeper. I think the bride can take care of herself. How do you know she wasnt going to talk to her hubby about it and not make a scene? How do u know it was directly on her ass? Were u drinking? How do u know it was intentional? There are so many variables. Since you thought you had to tattle on a grown woman, at her wedding, YTA."

Your mother forgave your father and decided to continue building a life with him, but she has always known that this might also mean accepting his other child. Indeed, poor Eugene who didn’t get to grow up feeling the love and support of his father because he was a “shameful” throwaway on all sides. Shame on you for not at least having compassion for him. You are allowed to be upset with your parents for not telling you sooner but not with your sibling...even if you didn’t grow up with him. One of the simplest ways of being a good person is extending empathy to others. imagine if you were the outside child. I guess you would hope that attempting to understand where you came from and who may be like you because of shared blood would be welcomed. Think about how vulnerable and nervous he must have felt reaching out. Think about what rejection even on a small scale feels like and then think about how big this scale is and how crushing it could be to know once again you weren’t wanted just because you are you. This moment is not about you and your attempts to punish your family into making it about you and whatever fantasy you were all living prior to his reaching out. It is about reality and how real lives work. Don’t be the person who misses a chance to be good in order to cause drama where love is a better option."
d0r737,"NAH, you aren’t being unreasonable or asking him to completely stop watching the shows. You are asking for a very simple compromise, for him to use headphones so you can be in your own room/house. That’s a very reasonable request, and your fiancé should respect that. He may be annoyed with it, but come on. Him dealing with inconvenience is 100% easier than you having to relive a trauma. But I understand why it’s annoying for him as well. I do believe to make this more of a compromise instead of a sacrifice on his end, you should start going to therapy regularly to process your trauma enough to do simple things like letting your fiancé enjoy his favorite shows."

There’s nothing wrong with porn, and people are free to enjoy it as they wish, but there is EVERYTHING wrong with telling your partner that they need to indulge in kinks to be sexually interesting.

Snickering when she tried to include you, and the way you’re talking about her beliefs now, shows how little you think of them.

If your husband seemed at all willing to help deal with the dog's numerous issues, then you'd be the asshole, but until then, he is."
d0tuxh,"NTA, and it sounds like they’re talking about you behind your back.

d0u1sr,"YTA. You can't expect someone else to not purchase something they want just because you're choosing to send money home. (Yes, it's a choice- it might feel like an obligation, but you can choose to cut back on how much you send, or not send anything. Think of it as, what would your family do if you were struggling too and couldn't send them anything.) 

Maybe just don't go, if it upsets you this much. Ask the friend to accompany you elsewhere, or to hang out at home, where spending money isn't necessary."
d0u5cw,"NTA

Ask them to move out or whatever but keep different issues separate."
d0ue3k,"Well, your personality certainly isn’t.

DUDE. This is amazing. I'm really happy for you!

I am mid 30s.  Have a teen son turning 16 this year. 

I put myself through uni. As a single mum. 

Had to do 30 hour a week placements in a hospital as part of uni.   50% of my time at uni I was on placement.

And continued to work 16 hours a week in a job (had to be min of those hours to get govt assisted childcare costs help).

It was hell.  

Then ofc the paying bills, doing housework... All that stress.  And time.  

Then I had 3000 word essays to do.  Each time I was on placement.  At the same time...

How TF I passed my nursing degree.  I'll never know. 

And how I didn't melt down or burn out!! 

What I DO KNOW is.  That I would've learned a Hella ton more during my uni time and placements. Had I not needed to work and have the constant stress of paying the bills and childcare issues. 

I'd try explain what you've got down here to your parents. 

That it's down to this.   You WILL PASS with how you're doing things now.   Now THE BALANCE is more there.

But the way things were... It was too unbalanced and your *studies suffered*.

Heck If they were unreasonable still I'd wanna ask....  ""do you *want* me to pass this course?""

You've been handed a great gift.  That's lifting a huge burden.  That will help you reach your full potential and dreams. 

This is *amazing*

AND.  You're still being sensible about it all.  And wanting to work some. 

You're being very sensible about it all.

My son will be off to uni in a couple years. 

If you were him, id be very proud of you for how you're handling this all."

d0vm84,"NTA for not officiating, unless this is a last minute decision that could mess up their wedding (2 months or less away). 

It's possible your friend is being abused. It's also possible you're drawing this conclusion from what you saw at their worst (which may not be an indicator of what the relationship is like as a whole). You know your friend best, so that's up to you. 

I don't mean to offend you, but you sound like a fairweather friend. The friend changing where they work isn't a huge barrier to overcome. Neither is moving states. You can still call them and visit occasionally. I live in a different area than my best friend, and we still talk every week and see eachother once every two months or so."

Don’t cover for her/ protect her, but don’t be nasty about the situation because I can almost guarantee your kids will always remember what you’ve said and how you’ve acted. 

I’m not saying you’ve done a super terrible crime either, but moving forward try be as neutral as possible. You’re the parent, you set the standards.

Edit-after reading most of the replies I just want to add that I understand the debate of is the mother an asshole too. However, I don’t believe it’s the main point, or even something to focus on.

As someone who has personally been a shoulder to cry on from as long as I can remember for my mother- its friggin horrible.

You are only there to make her feel better about herself. And that's a shitty reason to be someone's friend. You deserve better than that in a best friend. You are NTA for distancing yourself and wanting to step down, but you need to do it soon so she can find someone to replace you."

Especially considering you’ve indicated that their diets don’t bother you, what’s bothering you is you feel they are somehow disrespecting your effort. 


They like your meal! Adding meat to it doesn’t mean they don’t appreciate your effort, just that they want to tweak it to suit their tastes. When other people cook for you, do they ever modify their dish for you? For me, when I’m at family dinners or a friend is cooking, they usually make a single portion separately for me without meat. I don’t really see how what they are doing is any different.

d0yaqi,"YTA. Regardless of her situation, you took advantage of her hospitality and promised to pay her, and then said you were ""a little broke"" and she would have to wait ""a few more weeks."" That's not cool. There's no excuse for not being aware of how much money you had, or for not paying her, and $30 is utterly shameful. Work out how much a hostel would have cost you for three nights, and pay her at least that. You used her."
d0yi30,"YTA if you knew the dog was in poor health, why weren’t you taking care of it before they felt the need to take it? A senior dog needs proper care just like a senior person. Maybe your MIL should also go somewhere she will get proper care. Leave the dog where it is happy. I never understand why people insist on letting unhealthy seniors have animals when they clearly can’t care for them as if the animal isn’t a living creature that has needs. It’s selfish."

d0yif6,"YTA - wife is ill.  Wife > adult kids. Suggest doing holiday with wife only, or split with holiday wife plus her kids, then wife plus your kids.  Shame on all of you for not working this all out long ago and both of you teaching your kids not to be rude to other people."

Your boyfriend doesn't really get to tell you who you can and can't hang out with. However, getting cheated on is impactful and while it doesn't mean every person you date will cheat, it does cause some insecurity that shouldn't just be brushed aside.

They’re asking you to put a baby in the car for over an hour a day and you to spend 4 hours a day on the road. That’s nuts

Every day :

Home to parents:  40 minutes

Parents to work :   80 minutes

Work to parents:    80 minutes

Parents to home:   40 minutes

That’s an extra 2 hours and 20 minutes a day that you’re going to need for dinner, laundry, errands, time with your family, and the things you have to do to keep your life running . Not to mention the hit you’ll take on sleep because you have to get up so much earlier in the morning to make that trip and back

d107cq,"NTA

Go. Leave. Get out. They are all dragging you down. They are all perfectly capable of fending for themselves and just don’t because someone else (dad and now you) were always going to do it. 

Sink or swim. They can’t rely on you forever. They need to find work or apply for benefits.

d1088l,Wow NTA this should have been a discussion between you and your wife before she agreed to paying for part of the trip.
d108or,"NTA

It doesn’t sound like you and Laura are friends anymore. Friends are people with whom you enjoy spending time with. Friends support you in times of need. Friends care about and are considerate of tour well being. Friends are people who enrich your life and make you feel good about who are as a person (unless you’ve made a terrible choice on something and then they Cal that shit out for your good!). 

It doesn’t sound like Laura is any of these things to you anymore. Slowly distancing yourself from the relationship would be a kind strategy. If she asks about the distance, be honest. Tell her that you always leave the conversations with her feeling full of sadness no matter what you’ve done to see the bright side and that those effects hurt you. 

I’m sorry this has happened( it’s always hard to let go of a long term friendship."
d109c1,"NTA.  Leave this woman.  You shouldn't be with anyone who ""demands"" your phone.  There are normal women in the world who do not act like this.  Do you have free reign to her private space as well or is it just one sided because of your gf's massive insecurities?"
d109ha,No offense but if you don’t remember anything that actually happened why are you dwelling on it and posting about it?
d10b1t,"NAH, imo. They aren’t an asshole for asking, but you aren’t an asshole for refusing to refund.

While, legally, you probably are equally responsible for the lease ending fee, since she made the decision to end it, causing you to have to scramble to find a place, she should pay it. To be honest, it sounds like she was using you for her own ends. If she moves, no extra cost to her, and if she didn't move, you'd be a placeholder until some other plans bore fruit. That's not a good friend. She had no consideration for how her plans affect you at all."
d10jfn,"NTA, you should spend your money as your values dictate.

d10xcp,"ESH.

Her, for taking out her own insecurities by being mean about others.

d114xd,"YWBTA - it will eventually come out, so you may as well bite the bullet sooner rather than later.

Invite her out someplace neutral and just explain the situation. It actually doesn’t sound like you were one of his cheating partners but potentially could have been.

Explain that you have gotten to know her and like her and don’t want anything to potentially cause problems between you in the future.

Good luck."

d1153m,"NAH I wouldn't be mad at her she's a old lady who doesn't want to inconvenience her niece, my grandmother is similar but we finally had to sit her down and tell her that she needs to let things be done for her because when she hurts herself it's more trouble to take of her than it is to do the little things. I would sit down with your aunt and tell her she needs to let you do things."
d115xx,"You sound like you maybe are not as mature as you think you are. A big part of maturity is learning to act graceful in situations like this. Hate is a really strong emotion. Don't waste it on something like this. That will only hurt you in the long run.

d11oa6,"NAH- I understand that you are feeling a bit mugged off, but if they truly haven't received a notice then I can understand where there coming from.

d1243h,"Your mother and your father have been separated for many many years. A very long time.  They both deserve happiness.

Don’t assume everything your mother told you is the absolute truth.  Have a private conversation about this  with your father only .   Many times the truth is somewhere in between.  You may never know the exact truth.

But consider this ... 

Your mother has known that you had this tutor for 3 years and did nothing .  She apparently did not mind you being around this woman for 3 years.  And now she steps forward? Why? 

You have know nthis tutor for years. You all like her. You said you have a strong bond with her. If she and your father can be happy together, and she is kind and loving with you and your siblings, that is a good situation. 

Don’t make any snap judgements here. You’re 17 and you need to not think like a child, but almost an adult.

And many children often shoulder blame in a divorce and it’s almost NEVER their fault and it’s certainly not yours.  Let that part go and feel peace about yourself no matter how this story turns out."
d1246b,"NTA, he works at a pizza place lol it was probably mad busy and he was hating his life at that moment."
d12arm,"YTA.  I don’t feel like ESH because loud vehicles are an issue if you live in a city or near a street, and all motorcycles seem to make more noise than most cars.

d12ftx,"I'm going to say NAH. I've never been in the situation, but research shows that it's not uncommon for victims of abuse to return to their abuser in one form or another. Often, it takes a hard path and multiple attempts to finally cut off the abuser for good.

I understand your concerns, and I would be extremely frustrated in your shoes. However, I really dont think it would do any good to cut your sister out of your life. If anything, it might push her further to her abuser if she feels like she's losing people. 

Try your best to be empathetic, help her, set some firm boundaries, but ultimately her decisions are her decisions and the way she feels is the way she feels. I would try to remove your feelings from the situation and focus on helping her."

Insurance could well be your get-out."
d12ked,"NTA

Yikes. It's your car, driving on pebbly roads are even more dangerous, it's night, unfamiliar area, AND it's raining. This is a recipe for a disaster. Frankly, he's a new driver, I wouldn't let him drive me in ANYONE'S car in that scenario until a year or two (or more) given the circumstances. Stick to your guns. Let him risk his own life and own car."
d12kqu,ESH.  He should have talked to you first.  But your mother has put him in a position that he is not comfortable with.  You minimize his feelings and the reliance on him to keep your mother happy.
d12l69,"NAH here. It's not a big deal for target that this lady gets a small discount by mistake. Elderly people tend to not have lots of money so good for her to have received it. You wanted to help out the cashier, secure your own discount and maybe justice or whatever."
d12mxe,"NTA. try not to say it in a mean way but he needs to know. if he doesn't face the truth and get help then nothing will change and he'll end up isolating himself from everyone he meets. it will hurt him to hear, but he'll be better off if he knows the truth."
d12s9w,NTA. You parked in the lines. Screw her.
d12v9x,NTA. This is disturbing behavior from him though. If someone tells you they have to pee you stop at a station or stop on the side of the road if necessary. This is a serious red flag of abuse.
d12vdz,"NTA if you go and ask them about the fees. There are many reasons why you could get charged even with insurance.

d13fpg,"ESH, you for giving ultimatums and him for being a jerk when he's going through withdrawal.

Looks like I might be first comment.

I'll say it here, you SHOULD definitely tell them how you feel about their commentary as from what I'm reading, some of it sounds borderline racist (yes, racism can also be against ""white people"") and they are being ass-holish by even saying stupid stuff like that (hence my judgment).

If they have been great friends / are great friends, they would likely expect you to voice any concerns you have with their behaviour / commentary, so have a chat with them about it."
d13ra8,"ESH.it’s just food without animal products.  It’s not that difficult.  It’s one thing if it was some hidden ingredient but to play dumb about milk and eggs, come on!

d13rql,"ESH. This is. The pettiest thing. I have ever read. Holy shit. Ofc you want to be interested in his hobbies. Your married with a kid. but your being a dick about it and playing coy. He’s a dick for trying to stop you. It’s not like you guys need to do everything together cause that would drive you both insane. But being active in the same group if you both enjoy it is like. Common sense. If he needs a “safe space” His gaming group will service that just fine because I highly doubt you play the same stuff he does at the same time. He doesn’t need two spaces. The fact that your not trying to actually talk about it seriously with him and snooping around is just. Eughhhhhh.

Edit: if you take one thing from this. Just learn to compromise"
d13za1,There’s no reason to go straight to “get the fuck off your phone.” Without even asking nicely first. But people who use phones in movies are a special kind of assholes. ESH.
d143to,"Mild ESH but your uncle sucks more. Since you opened your cousin's gift you should have just opened your uncle's gift too since he asked and you said you would.

d14d9k,"Gonna lean towards YTA. She asked you to dress up for a night out. You didn't want to, and when she was upset, you grabbed her phone out of her hands.  That's shitty behavior. Also, I'm guessing she's not upset about this one night. Something bigger is bugging her. 

Maybe next time, just dress up and take her out for a night on the town."
d14fcn,NAH. It’s weird you didn’t mention your plans. He could have woken up and not known where you were. But you didn’t mean anything by it.

d14gnz,NTA. The man was the aggravated.

d14xyp,"NAH because you have a right to mention your relationship as it is. That being said, your brother also has the right to not like it.

d151oq,"Nobody has the same clothes as me because I am obsessed with thrift shops. It's not everyones cup of tea, but your sister can always keep an open mind and go take a look. Gemma has NO CHANCE of buying the same thing muha ha ha

Otherwise, I guess Gemma really really admires your sister and has issues with finding her own identity, and kinda views your sister in an aspiring way. Perhaps she will also value your sisters opinion as well...for example, next time they both go shopping together your sister can help her out a little..."" Hey Gemma, honestly, I can't pull off this green, but wow does it ever look good on you"" etc etc

If not well.. How long has this been going on? Im guessing that Gemma will eventually phaze out and eventually discover herself.

I think it'd be good for you and your husband to have an open-minded, empathetic conversation with each other about this, in detail, so you can understand each other's positions.

d15qgw,"YTA his comparison is very apt. You knew he was uncomfortable every single day, and you knew you had something that very likely could have relieved his pain/discomfort.

I'm a little on the fence about your sister. It's impossible to say if your relationship would have been like this no matter what, or if it's a result of a grieving, neglected kid lashing out. If she doesn't want contact with you, and you aren't interested in a relationship with her, dropping contact is fine.

>My dad would ever abuse his grandkids.

I assume you meant this to mean ""never"", but never say never. Abusers abuse. Even when they are in their 70s, even when they seem ""so sad"" even when they have shitty lonely lives (that they created for themselves by abusing their family and friends). 

Maybe (maybe) your father is not abusing your child now. But he is an abuser and can and will make the switch. What if your child is gay? What if your son catches him at a bad time, acts up, grows up and isn't cute and sweet anymore and your father starts to victimize him? What if he is currently abusing your own child and it's not something you even recognize because your ""normal meter"" is so broken that you're bringing your own child around someone who has a track record of abusing children. 

Abusers program their victims to prioritize their needs over the victims needs and even the needs over their friends and family. I think you should take a good hard look at yourself and ask yourself if that is not what you are doing. Why does your father's desire to be an ""excellent"" grandparent trump your child's safety? Why do you view your siblings preventing your father from seeing their children as them ""getting even"" and not them protecting their children from the abuse they suffered? Also how do you think your child will feel when they grow up and realize that their ""sweet"" grandfather was someone who abused their children? Are you not worried that this will effect your son's future relationships? That he will miss the warning signs of abuse because he was brought around his abusive grandfather and was fine?

You're playing a really dangerous game and your son's safety is on the line."

I feel like doing something personal for them would help you feel better as well. These kids don’t have families and I think they have chosen you. That’s fine if work brings you to better places.

d1gh6f,"I’m not going to say you’re an asshole, because you’re not. What you were trying to do was really lovely and sweet, but ill advised. As someone who worked in pediatric oncology, I understand how hard this is for all of you, and how hard it can be to watch your sibling be robbed of a childhood. There’s no other way of putting it- it’s unfair and cruel that she can’t be a kid right now. 

However, there’s a reason children don’t make their medical decisions. There’s a reason her parents and oncologists didn’t want her to go. If she’s been getting treatment, she is probably very immunocompromised and could get sick quick and badly at that party. Her health and safety have to come first right now, and it makes it all the more unfair to her. Because right now, those have to come before her childhood. 

Listen to your parents. Listen to the doctors. Be there for your sister. 

You can ask the social worker at the floor/clinic/hospital she’s receiving treatment at for ways to help make this horrible experience a little bit easier for your sister. I used to do pediatric oncology social work, so if you want to talk about anything or some resources (depending on where you live) I can help you out. My DMs are open!

Good luck with everything. Sending you all love.

3. What he did was harmless, you're going too far by trying to get him in trouble. As if you've never done anything naughty and gotten away with it.

d1jyju,"YTA. And I'm going to come at you with three barrels - I've had breast reduction, I'm still a DDD after the surgery, and I work as a bra fitter. 

First off, a D cup really means doodly squat. The cup size only refers to the difference in inches between a woman's ribcage and the measurement around the fullest part of her breast. I have fitted women who are D cups and you wouldn't be able to guess it in a million years if you didn't know better.

Secondly I've had reduction. It was the best decision I've ever made in my life. I went from a H cup to a DDD, and I look fantastic. It solved my back problems and I look proportional and perfect. 

Third, while you are welcome enough to your opinions, there's a rule of thumb: if it can't be fixed in five minutes, don't tell someone you have a problem with their appearance. I'm aware this isn't the case in what you said, but you probably should have stuck with commiserating silently instead of making comments that may have made your friend uncomfortable about her body."

d1jyy5,"It's a very difficult situation you're in, and even though YWBTA if you told his parents and brothers about his alcoholism, there is still a lot you can do.

First, you need to know that he is the father and you are his child. Despite being an adult yourself now, it is not your job or responsibility to fix your parents. Learning to know how to set boundaries to protect your own well-being is going to be a hugely beneficial tool for you.

Second, your mom is also an adult and it isn't your job to save her either. Right now she is enabling him by buying him the alcohol. Until she realizes that she has the power and ability to say no, she will no longer enable his addiction, she needs to figure that out on her own. Unless of course you feel her life, your life, or anyone's life for that matter is in danger. In that case always call 911. 

I'd definitely suggest checking out Al-Anon for both you and your mother, and Adult Children of Alcoholics for yourself. You're just starting your life, don't let your father's alcoholism affect it anymore."

He could have legitimately just been trying to have a conversation with you about something that he didn't realize was upsetting. It was a single conversation, and there's nothing illegal about bringing up politics at work.

The adult thing to do is to tell him that you're uncomfortable with that type of conversation. Yeah, it's hard, but you're talking about bringing his job and life under scrutiny because of a single conversation which could have been misunderstood.

If he pushes the issue, continues to bug you, etc, then yes, absolutely, bring in HR. But give him a chance - he could just be an awkward person. If you never told him to drop it, then being awkward is literally the only thing he did wrong, which doesn't justify having his life brought under a microscope.

I'm big on bringing stuff to HR when it's justified - but the adult thing to do is to at least express that you're uncomfortable before doing it, since he technically did nothing wrong. (Just, again, awkward as hell.)"

That’s life and it’s what friends are for - of course she shouldn’t rub it in that she’s happy and you aren’t, but she should be able to still share the same things with you as she always does.

Also, a word of advice, improve your grammar. This is Reddit, not Discord or Xbox Live’s Chat function. We don’t really use contractions like ‘idc’ or run-on sentences here.

(I have seen it, I have, it is sad).

Of course, I don't know how you phrased it and how it sounded to her, maybe you should talk it trough. Maybe you left her feeling like you are ashamed of her and that made her lash out, and you should try to explain to her that you just wanted you both and your family to have a drama-free night.

However, if she did wear that dress, and your family made comments or your uncle made comments, I would say that, as someone else pointed it out, you would have to deal with it.

All 4 of us born in Washington. The last tree is a Quaking Aspen which is Utah's state tree and represents our son who was born in Utah 10 months ago. The 2 saplings are Western hemlocks that represent the 2 babies we have lost. The dove represents the holy spirit.

Very common contractor/freelancer tactic to upscale costs to the for clients you feel will be either *trouble clients* or clients you really don’t want to take but don’t want to openly reject.

If I understand correctly, your grandparents were loving and understanding, and welcomed both you are your now-wife into their home. On multiple occasions. They chose not to attend your wedding on religious grounds, but didn’t change their behavior towards you at all. In return, you ghosted them. 

That’s certainly understandable, but it’s a very all-or-nothing approach. In an ideal world everyone would be 100% ok with gay people and gay marriage, but there are also a TON of gay people who would kill to have your grandparents, who remained loving relatives after you came out. 

It’s your choice whether you see your grandmother or not, and certainly your choice whether you accept her money, but at least consider the possibility that it’s a bad idea to throw away a loving relationship with a grandparent. I understand that she couldn’t get over the “marriage” hurdle in time for your wedding, but it sounds like she’s pretty damn enlightened compared to many elderly hard-core Catholics.

To me this isn’t so much of a question of generational differences in use of language but more so symptomatic of a belief that a woman should be compliant and constantly grateful. No thanks ‘sweetie’.

EDIT: This is for the angry men and women in the comments. We’re not your sweeties. We’re not your darlings. We’re not your loves. If I don’t know you- don’t call me that. For too long have these ‘terms of endearment’ been used as methods of putting women in their place and infantilising them. There are many ways to be kind and respectful.

Those are opposite ends of the spectrum and it was right to raise red flags because literally anything could be going on (gambling, drugs, or any other possibility).

d1unop,"NAH - I get the desire to have more CASUAL (not work related) interactions with other adults that are not centered around the kids. I also think it's perfectly reasonable to want to have an evening where something is not scheduled so you can either work (which enables her to stay home) or to spend it as a family. It doesn't sound like you have any night set aside for a YOU activity either, and if you're working that much you need it just as badly as she does. The math says that you're working at least 19 hours a week of overtime. Assuming a 5 day a week schedule, that puts you working 3.8 hours of overtime every work day.

My .02 is that you need to revisit her work schedule OR find another babysitter who can work with no notice that evening (good luck with that...). Is it possible for her to work more to make up for you taking every Thursday evening off? If this golf thing is a priority for her, then she needs to find a way to make it work for EVERYONE, not just herself. Family is about compromise, and it sounds like this is a situation where you need to find one. You might also stress to her that you WANT her to be able to go out and have fun, but feel like you can't take care of the family without the flexibility to work that night. It's a tough thing, but everyone is compromising for her staying home and you need to decide what the priorities are."

Studying and stuff like that comes first. Real life over D&D (I love the game, so don't get me wrong here). Your friends really should understand that. Maybe you could be clearer about how school is going and how you need to spend more time on that. Additionally, you did try to make a day that worked, and it didn't, so you at least gave it a shot. The DM should have talked to you about it, because a character can be a personal thing and not everyone is comfortable with someone else jaggering your brainchild. However, you definitely could have reacted with more tact, such as by PMing the DM instead of replying on the group chat. Furthermore, coming from the stance of both a DM and a player,  writing a character out of a situation can be done and honestly isn't that hard if you're willing to put 5 minutes of work into it to have a good reason for your character to disappear for a session. Lastly, you could ask someone you trust in the group to play your character for you so they don't die.

EDIT to add that as others have pointed out it's probably true that she can't get out of child support if the guy decides to pursue it, and she should consider that in deciding whether to continue with the pregnancy.   This does not change the fact that the guy is an asshole, though--he has manipulated her into keeping the kids, is trying to manipulate her during the pregnancy, and is very likely to use the kids to manipulate her and stay in contact with her after they are born.

d203c2,"Im going with NAH and let me explain why before I get chewed up and spat back out here.

You describe this as borderline hoarding with some behaviour that sounds hoarder-like and your post sounds very similar to someone dealing with a hoarder (check out r/hoarding for more of them). And you describe your mother as a narc. Now I am an adult child of a narcissist as well and have worked for years to deal with mild hoarding tendencies (clutter in all my storage spaces that i'm trying to work on but still clean and easily liveable) and this is a fairly common thing.

Dealing with a hoarder, even a mild one, is not just about cleaning up. Actually, if you push them to clean up without dealing with the underlying issues behind the hoarding, you will set the hoarder into a tailspin where they feel out of control and quickly rebuild their hoard (usually bigger) trying to feel in control again. To them it's not actually about the stuff. It's about the control and using the stuff as an emotional bandage of sorts. Taking the stuff away just forces them to confront the pain behind the bandaid which is hard and scary so they hoard again as a new bandage.

Now, you seem to be on the younger side and I would bet you can't get your sister into therapy but that's what she needs. She needs to talk to someone with experience in hoarding and trauma/abuse (because we all know narcs are terribly abusive people) who can process this with her and help her find other, healthier coping skills. Head on over to the Hoarding subreddit and see if they can get you some resources or an idea of who you can try talking to. 

I can see you care about her and just want the best for her so you are not TA but at the same time hoarders don't choose to become hoarders. They do it as a backward way to cope, similar to self-medicating and can't generally see the problem with it so I don't think she's TA either."

Making sure your friend rechecks and doesn't miss class is a good thing to do - you helped them out! But the staircase thing? I can't see how it's helpful to anyone to argue at all, and I can see why someone would be annoyed with you arguing that point, even if you're 100% right."

At the level of relationship you described it was not appropriate for him to ask you to do dishes.

Every part of your post describes the assumptions you made and your refusal to communicate.

You assumed you'd live by the same rules, while not communicating them from the start.

You assumed what your roommate's understanding of the (lack of) rules was rather than communicating to find out what they were.

Now you're purposefully making your roommate uncomfortable, rather than communicating, so you can win this perceived battle for the common area that only exists in your head.

What if your roommate is in the common area as a gesture of openness, making an effort to be friendly?

Your reaction to this is seriously weird."
d22rqo,"NTA. I understand that your mom probably gets excited about it, and the way she wants to enjoy the movie is to help you notice all the little details and talk about them with you... that itself doesn't make her an asshole. Some people just enjoy things differently. However, the fact that you've asked her to stop and she gets upset instead of stopping makes her kind of an asshole. You should try to understand that she's doing it because she wants you to enjoy the movie more too and probably doesn't understand your side, but the way you enjoy things isn't wrong either and she needs to understand that!"

d238pg,"YTA and I’m sure I’ll be downvoted for this. 

You and your BFF got a dog and now expect your roommate to change her night schedule so puppy doesn’t get excited and keep you awake. You got a puppy without  *really* realizing that puppies are excitable and bark and need lots of training to teach this behavior out of them.  The cage you put her in through the night isn’t enough to calm her down and stop disturbing your sleep and your neighbors (god I feel bad for your neighbors) so you need to figure out how to train your dog better. It’s not the dog’s fault because she is a puppy. It’s not your roommates fault because she should be able to cook in her apartment when she wants to and be reasonably quiet without expecting a dog to go off. You’ve got to do better."

But one thing about depression is that we can take things differently then we used to, and that can be an enormous adjustment for those around us. I'm just guessing because you didn't mention how you usually react to these comments, but for example: Whereas before he might get a rise out of you and get a ""fun upset"" or ""fun argument""type response where none of it was serious and you weren't really upset and it was all playful, he's now getting a much more serious response. and that's a big mental adjustment.

Whenever I met with anyone whilst being on the relationship she would get jealous, and she wouldn't go with me anywhere we weren't alone, but I thought that wasn't healthy and gave her all the freedom in the world, but telling me she was going to try and get the guy who ignored her when she was little to be with her and having me as backup is where I draw the line.

d2757v,"NAH . It is completely understandable that youre struggling to help your friend. The truth of the matter is nothing you say will help her. 

I've suffered from chronic depression my whole life, and when you're in that hole, nothing anyone says even has an effect on you. You feel completely isolated from everyone and hurt all of the time. The sheer pain you're in is so indescribable, it's hard for anyone to really understand depression unless they've lived it. 

So it makes sense that you're struggling to connect and find the magic combination of words that would snap her out of it, but the problem is a lot more complex than that. It's tough being the giver in a relationship when it doesn't feel appreciated or heard. 

That being said, that doesn't mean you listening to her complaining doesn't help. You being there for her through it all is what is going to help her the most. If you ditch now, that's just another reason why shes so unlucky and will never be happy. She pushes everyone away. The right thing to do is be with her when you can and just listen. Don't give any advice unless she asks for it specifically. The advice isn't what's making the difference. Having someone to listen is. 

I've been on both sides and depression really puts a strain on the relationship, but that's your chance to show you're not going anywhere and you two will get through it together. 

I'm glad to hear she is seeing a doctor. I hope she will see a therapist which will be the most beneficial for her and for you.

In situations like this I personally like to consider who is harmed.  If you hide the relationship with your partner, that hurts your partner because it's pretending that your relationship isn't real enough for you to admit it to a close family member.  If you don't hide the relationship... well nobody is harmed.  Your sister may not like it, but it won't actually hurt her feelings.  She already knows you are gay, and whatever concerns she has about divulging that to her child are only to protect her from having to have a difficult (for her) conversation with your nephew.  Your nephew certainly won't care.  I suggest apologies to your partner."

Your sister is also telling things to her therapist that you are not around to hear and you do not know what prompted her to suggest cancelling the concert.  She apologised.  She can't do it right now.  She's looking after herself.  That shouldnt be punished, it should be praised.

That's hard and disappointing.

I'd return the rack your boyfriend got you, clean up the garage, and take yourself out on a day alone with the cash.

While I wouldn't say you're an asshole, I would say that maybe it would be more productive to bring this to the principal, and that your teacher's lame duck excuse, ""I can't do anything about this,"" is garbage. Who says he can't? I'd like to know.

Because just as frustrating as the lazy kid getting an A for work he didn't do, would be you getting a D for work he didn't do. Group projects only work if *everyone* does the work, and if someone doesn't, there should be consequences for *that person*, not the people who literally have no authority over them -- their classmates.

Only your teacher/principals can enforce student work, through the grading system or other forms of discipline. To penalize you or to reward him for gaming the system is your teacher doing his job poorly.

Edited to add a judgment."

Just because people are related or live together does not mean that they must be included in all plans. Sometimes it's nice to have time with just one sibling or friend, and there is nothing wrong with that. Might also provide a nice opening to discuss his behavior if you think it is worthwhile. He was upset to be excluded, so maybe if he understood why he was excluded, he'd have incentive to make some changes."

You have your boundaries. He routinely violates them. Thus, N-T-A.

But he very likely does so because of his turbulent childhood, and frankly whatever amount of support you were able or willing to provide doesn't seem to have been enough for him to stabilize on. Barely out of high school, he got kicked out on his ass. That was more ""debilitating blow"" than ""tough love"". E-S-H.

But the real thing here is that he felt safe coming to you for help. He's 18 and bouncing around looking for housing. There's a good chance he just doesn't have the money to go to a laundromat. 

I'm not gonna judge your situation based just on what you wrote in this post. I'm sure it's a good deal more complex than you've written.

Some companies run complexes with a smoker's building but those are rare. 

Some solutions for you. 

Speak to your landlord or management company and see if it's an HVAC issue first. This may also benefit your electric bill since you wont be paying to heat or cool other people apartments. 

Speak to your landlord  or management company about smoking inside the unit. You dont necessarily have to rat them out, but ask to see if its inside the lease agreement.  If it is, take a copy to your neighbor and politely show them where it says ""no smoking"" and inform them that you havent informed anyone.... yet. Be polite about this and everything should be fine. If they are rude about it still, see below. 

Inform the landlord or management company about your neighbors smoking inside the unit. Speak with your other neighbors and have them do the same thing. A company would rather kick one person out for not following the rules then lose multiple persons because of one asshole."

It'd be way worse if it happened like, right after your father died, for example. (Also, sending hugs and wishes for good luck with it.

It may be a different situation where he would be less of an AH if he found himself in a position unable to care for any pets at all (eg severe financial or health issues), but that’s obviously not the case here.

Some people here might call you the AH for not wanting to care for the dog, but honestly it sounds like he got it in the first place during a tense time and without your approval. You’ve already provided way more than you were obligated to by caring for it for the amount of time that you did."
d2gwlp,"NTA, you understandably want to play your character how you made them, DnD is about having fun with your pals, not bitching about rules and who’s right. I don’t think you’re intentionally hurting anything.

You don't live there, you don't pay rent, and she signed up to live with another girl, not a couple. I promise you, there's a major fucking difference. She is paying rent, so her voice counts. You are not paying rent, so yours does not. Additionally, you were both being incredibly selfish. And you were being a selfish freeloader.

Even if she was jealous, her reasons were more than valid. You two could've survived not sleeping together every night; If not, y'all had issues.

I lived in a house when I was in college with 4 other girls. All five of us had serious boyfriends. One of my roommates basically moved her boyfriend in without asking. It was super, super fucking annoying, inconsiderate, and rude. I couldn't walk around in a T-shirt and underwear in the morning when I went downstairs to grab coffee. I couldn't walk around without a bra without feeling uncomfortable. He took up space in the refrigerator. I had to hear them giggle and be cringey together all the time.

Trust me, you were a nuisance."

At least where I live, if your spouse is under drinking age they can drink with you at home. I was married at a young age too and took advantage of the same law. The employees should have known about this law if they were selling alcohol. They are supposed to check both IDs to make sure your names are the same. The manager was a dick and you had every right to make their day harder on them."
d2hb4z,"I must reluctantly inform you that YTA if you do this. I certainly understand your frustration and upset -- it sounds miserable -- but these are issues you should discuss with your manager. If you just start refusing to communicate, you can't fulfill your role well, which is a big A move in a work situation.

Please make a sit-down appointment to tell your direct boss what you're experiencing."
d2hd41,NTA.  Your mom is a drama queen.  Your brother stated numerous times what HE wanted for HIS birthday and mom completely ignored him.  She doesn't get to be upset when she's the problem.
d2hiyp,"Welcome to your first broken heart, bro. Emotions can seem overwhelming. NAH bc their intentions were concern for you. No one was trying to hurt you. So, you’ve got to learn like everyone else how to cope w rejection. You’re all so young here in this story, so everyone is learning. Try to take care of yourself well and when people are trying to be kind to you take that in bc those are the people that will matter to you later. All the best."

If people want to party they should set up how they get home ahead of time.

Also, as you mentioned, you’re risking people throwing up in your car and unlike if your sister throws up in your car, chances are you won’t be able to get them to fix it (like paying to get your car detailed.) 

Finally, you’re using your gas money to drive them around so really, if they want you to drive them they should pay you."

Not really. But take the dog to the GF's and drop him off with her parents. Explain she adopted it and it's hers. Your family can no longer take care of it.  
Another thing you can do is try to find out who the breeder is. If you can get the dog back the breeder most likely will take it back. You need to contact the breeder if possible and explain that the puppy is not being trained and your brother and his GF are neglecting it, and that your family was not in on the decision. They may have lied and told the breeder they live together or something."
d2i5rx,"NAH. Keep in mind that pregnancy dating is weird! Technically, they count the starting date of your pregnancy from the first date of your last period. This means that on the actual date of conception you are counted as “two weeks pregnant” and the day you miss your period (2 weeks post conception) you are four weeks pregnant. If she’s 18 weeks pregnant and you had sex with her 16 weeks ago, then the dates are bang on correct if you knocked her up right away. 

ALSO keep in mind that pregnancy dating can be somewhat inaccurate. They make their best guess at how far along you are based on how large the baby is measuring in an ultrasound. If your family makes weirdly large babies, she will appear farther along than she really is. Vice versa if there are any conditions that could slow fetal growth. Also, due dates can change because again they are just an estimate. They changed my due date (and thus their estimation of how far along I was) THREE separate times. 

Please google pregnancy dating before you make any accusations."

d2iakp,"A little bit YTA. You are avoiding your mom because you are uncomfortable with your dad. That’s hard on her. It’s like you are punishing her for your dad being difficult. 

I assume you are using banmal with your mom. As long as she is okay with it, that’s fine. Remember that your dad feels loyalty to her. He has this feeling of responsibility that he needs to protect her and direct you into being a proper person. It’s outdated. But he’s doing what he thinks a good father should do. Don’t punish your mom for it."

You say you know it’s not a hygiene issue, but then you tell her she needs to shower. She’s an adult. She will get to it. You can suck it up or help out more with cleaning  linens and bottles that you claim smell like the milk. Listen to her. You make her feel bad. You don’t have to, and if she can smell the milk all day, you can deal for a few minutes."
d2j1h9,"NAH. You are interpreting the wearing of the ring as a symbol of his commitment to you. He is interpreting the ring as an object unrelated to his commitment.

d2j4zw,"NTA- She sounds awful. Although, for the future reference- a lot of women get cramps and while she may have been loud in the drugstore, these things are normal. More importantly she just sounds insensitive and entitled. Sorry your dealing with this. I would see if you can get your Mom alone and ask if there is a way to minimize your time with her friend. Hopefully your mom will get it"
d2jevs,"Sorry kid, YTA. Not for not wanting to tutor him anymore, that's an unfair expectation. But your brother is clearly learning disabled and calling him names and shaming his intelligence is more likely to make him get discouraged and quit. Your parents should be consulting with the school to get him extra help, it isn't on your shoulders, but you owe your brother an apology and some quality time to make it up to him. He probably really looks up to you and if he thinks you think he's a lost cause, he's going to give up completely"
d2jg1o,"As someone who worked in oncology, I'm going to go with NAH. But I do think you were a bit inconsiderate.

She was dying, and she knew it. That fucking sucks and is fucking unfair. You can't expect her to be happy or focused on being on her knees thanking you for being there. This isn't to say you were being shitty- It sounds like you were trying to support her the best way *you* knew how. Did you try asking her ""What can I do for you? How can I help you?""

People battling cancer have different needs, react differently, have different emotional responses to their diagnoses. Some people want the people in their corner like you, some want people who overflow the positivity like the neighbor, some people want people who ignore it, some want people who will just sit there and agree about how fucked their situation is, and the list goes on and on.

Also, it would've been incredibly inconsiderate to confront her on her attitude ever with this - regardless of who was around.

You were trying to be a supportive friend the best way you could. You did the best could with what you had. That doesn't make you an asshole. She was dying a shitty, painful, long death. She wasn't concerned with catering to your desire to be a good friend - which is also justified. You both were just doing your best in a super cruel situation.

I don't blame you for feeling guilty, it is only natural. This is a sad and painful situation. She was still your friend. Don't talk to her husband about this, but I do suggest you speak to a therapist about it. I'm so sorry for your loss."
d2jhpx,"NTA. Chewing with your mouth open is disgusting in general, and horrible table manners, but way worse with misophonia. There’s no reason for her to become irrationally angry over you asking. Your family is disrespectful for treating this like it’s not a big deal when it for sure is."

d2kbu4,"ESH (aside from you). Your friend based off of what you said though sounds like he needs to learn how to be a better friend and not sell stuff that doesn’t belong to him, & your mom needs to not flip out. It still was your laptop. She shouldn’t be threatening you just because she needs it for work. For all she knows, you could’ve maybe needed both for college. As for you, you had every right (idk if that’s the right phrase to use) to be nervous & send him that thread. You told him that you were loaning it to him until you needed it back, & he took horrible care of it, & has a past of not taking care of other people’s things either. There’s nothing like a little kick in the pants to motivate someone"

Nothing good comes from holding on to resentment and anger. 

Is there any type of therapy or surgery you can undergo to resolve some pain or is that completely out of the question? Stay positive and I'm wishing you well :)"
d2kgmd,"**NAH**. How close are you to finishing high school? I understand how your mom must feel, homesickness never goes away. But there’s a valuable point in the fact that your mom can’t use her degree in the US. If you finish high school in South America, you’d have trouble using it in America. Finish your education here. The US is pretty exclusive about whose education they accept.

I had a long conversation once with a taxi cab driver who was a civil engineer in Lebanon. In America, he drove a cab.

Perhaps you could start college here and she can go home then?"

d2ki9t,"NTA. Let me be sure I’ve got this right: you flew to another country to meet up with a friend you hadn’t seen in ages, and they kept picking up new girls and making plans with them? It would be one thing if he was in the early stages of dating someone he really liked and he didn’t want to blow her off etc, but this seems like wholly unnecessary plans. I’m sorry your friend is being shitty. That being said, that’s clearly what he thinks is ok. So, perhaps make some of your own plans too?"
d2ktfz,"NTA

Your in-laws are playing the “backseat driver” here. This is your child and this is your parenting, not theirs. Your son has already stated that he does not mind that you will be taking some time for yourself. Your husband has also assented to taking the kids for the day. It is not like you are going to be gone for the rest of their lives. It is not as if your absence puts them in some sort of dangerous situation.

If anything, it is important to have some time to recuperate and refresh oneself because parenting is a lifelong commitment and 24/7. Caregiver burnout (be it parent caring for a child, child caring for an elderly parent, taking care of a significant other with a chronic disease, etc.) is a very real thing and we should be focusing on self-healing and wellness so that we can be there for the long haul.

Your in-laws can disagree with you taking a day for yourself, but they should keep that opinion to themselves. As the saying goes, if they can’t say something nice, they should not say anything at all.

Enjoy your “me” day and do not let your in-laws make you feel guilty.

(This is coming from someone whose parents always hovered over us and constantly took their burnout on us AND someone who has had to counsel caregivers with burnout.)

Edit: if you have not considered this yet, you might want to have your husband talk to the in-laws and (in a more eloquent manner than me) tell them to mind their own business."

d2ky60,"NTA. It's okay to cut off friendships that are making you this uncomfortable. 

Look, I get you feel like you need to stand by your friend and get him through this, but you cannot be responsible for everybody's choices. If you've tried, as you say you have, and you feel there's nothing you can do, then maybe it's time to let go.

Your description of your friend shows signs of a decline into (right-wing) extremism and that is something you want to stay away from. Friends can shape your world view, so if you do decide to stick by him, make sure you are the one pulling you both up in stead of him pulling you both down."
d2l0ju,"Waaay against the grain here but NTA! I’ll be 23 in a month and there isn’t an 18 year old out there I would date because if I’ve said it once I’ve said it a million times. 

Two. Completely. Different. Life. Stages. 

An eighteen year old might still be in high school. A twenty three year old may have been graduated from college for a year. Hell, I wouldn’t date an eighteen year old in high school when I was a damn junior in college. 

It’s just creepy. Five years when you’re 50 and 45, no big deal. Five years when you’re 18 and 23, huge difference. Also the fact that they were flirting when she was seventeen is a big red flag. It’s like he was just waiting for the gross magic number. 

I don’t care how smart of an eighteen year old you are, when it comes to five years of life experience on you, that matters. Hell, four years matters. 

A huge thing I think people are missing is that sure, physical developmental changes are pretty much done happening. But other kinds of development are still going on even though we can’t see it!"
d2l6l3,"Based on your response that it is not legal, no, NTA. You are potentially wrecking your life with the risk of getting caught. She needs to hustle up her own green. I get that she's in pain, and I've witnessed first hand the effects of marijuana versus pain pills; I'm absolutely an advocate for those that can utilize the natural painkiller and avoid chemicals. However, no parent should ever put their child's future on the line by asking for them to break the law. That makes her the asshole, money issues aside."

You choose which relationships you value, and choosing not to value a relationship with someone who repeatedly crossed boundaries and disrespected people saying no is a smart choice. 

Of course she cried, of course she's upset. It's natural to be up;set when you lose friends.

I’ve lived in apartment buildings most of my life and the cardinal rule of shared laundry spaces is NOT “Spend hours of your life sitting here waiting for everything to be done.” but it is “Set a timer or something so you come back BEFORE your stuff is done so someone isn’t sat there looking at your clean laundry waiting for you to come back for it so they can start.”

You came back with ample time to get your shoes and some ass put their crap in with yours. That’s a big no no. If you had left the laundry finished and taken your sweet time going back for it I would understand them putting your shoes on the dryer and putting their stuff in but even that’s not what they did. They committed a laundry faux pas so I don’t see an issue with you deciding to commit one to grab a shoe that belongs to you."
d2m98t,"YTA - you aren't asking your friend to send screenshots that she has access to - you are asking her to use her BF's account to get photos and then forward them onto you.  Its the using her boyfriend to get this info that makes me think your friend is justified.

Whether or not she is a hypocrite isn't up for debate here (though I think she is) or whether she is a good friend or not - at the end of the day - you **are** being nosey and you just need to get over it.  You say that isn't up for her to judge.  But its also not up to her to feed your interest.  Being a good friend isn't about just saying yes all the time."
d2mewl,"NTA

It is kinda in poor taste considering you do work, BUT they conveniently categorize you as a child or adult based on their needs. Need a free babysitter? Kid. Handing out pocket money to children? Now you’re an adult. It was the adultier adults here who were assholes. They used you for free childcare when they could have literally just asked you do to it. I’m sure you would have said yes if they hadn’t manipulated you into doing it. 

Good on you for asking for the cash anyway. You can give it to your brother if you like, but the point is you taught the adults a lesson. Just because you are someone’s child does not make you a child."
d2mm5v,"NTA but your sister is wow. At the moment you're floating ideas, you don't have anything planned at all. I don't understand what she's so angry about unless she considers herself integral to the planning. Have you asked her to be Maid of Honor or something?"
d2mp13,"YTA but a soft one at that.

Life isn’t fair, people grow up in different social classes. I have fluctuated from middle class back down to being low key poor, but have grandparents who would buy me anything short of the world sometimes. What is exactly showing off? It’s not fair to anyone to “hide” items that you’re happy to have received. If your parents bought you an uppity brand of shoes would you not wear them? 

It’s not like they’re children, 13 is when you realize the financial differences in life and trying to “protect” feelings of others (who haven’t even voiced their opinion mind you) isn’t being helpful.

My mother works her ass off so I don’t have to, the benefit of that is having nice things. What’s the point of having nice things if you always hide them?"

3. Wanting to know everything about your partner is fine but only if you respect their boundaries, which you aren't.

If you ever come back on dating apps tho, don't mention you're talking to someone else on the app because that's normal and expected. People that have problems with this are redflags."
d2ouww,"NTA - I can't see how you keep working under such conditions with a schedule so chaotic, to say nothing of your boss not responding."
d2ow2x,"NTA. This trip costs you a lot of money and you’re spending it in order to have some quality time with your friend, not with other people. 
I used to live abroad and would find it acceptable if my friends wanted to come in different dates. This way it also gives you more time with each friend. I think it makes sense you’d want to go when and with whom you find suitable."
d2p38j,">have been no contact for 2 years after being told the death of my son was karma

Stopped reading here. NTA.

Maybe the stroke is karma for saying such awful shit to your own child."
d2p7di,NAH but I would consider giving her a part-time schedule. So she isn't scheduled the day or 2 after chemo (if possible depends on the type of chemo) You need another person anyway if you're so booked with 6 people one being out is costing you clients. those 6 people will get sick and need days off.
d2p7i9,Fucking hilarious. Not your fault she’s dumb.
d2p97p,But.. it's a blind date
d2pang,"YTA.  You aren’t paying rent consistently so you need to step up.   And the fact that you stepped in it makes it harder for the person who does have to clean it up.   Rule of any house you are living in is if you see the shit, you clean the shit.  

This sounds like one of several things you ""won’t do"".  You need to step up before you need to find another place to live."
d2pctt,"NTA

But, see if you can talk to a counselor or someone similar at your college so they can speak to him in a more respectful manner. 

Otherwise, I say send the email. He's obviously being extremely disruptive to everyone but no one wants to say anything. Just make sure you word it very politely."
d2peod,NTA fuck her double parking
d2pg2y,"YTA. At the very least, you should have double checked with your friend before agreeing to go with your gf. It would be a different story if you weren't told about it beforehand but she did ask if you were free that weekend and you said yes, and as far as you know, everyone said yes. What did you think was going to happen? Your best friend obviously had something in mind which you didn't even ask her about."
d2pnex,NTA. You need to get out of there. No one should go bankrupt trying to take care of their parents.
d2pra4,"NAH, but why even say 

> She is from a part of the world where people are stereotypically bad drivers.

Just say she totaled her first car. That's all the empirical data you need to provide.  The stereotypes are not relevant at all."
d2ptav,">They all know I game, and they think it's cool that his mother is in the know about the gaming world as their mothers are even against gaming! I sometimes ask to join him and his friends while we are playing together but he says it's weird to have an adult listening on

""It's cool that your mother has the same hobby as us, fellow 16 year old"" is not the same as ""hey, let's hang out with our friends mom while we play games!""

You're lucky you got this far with him. Now let him spread his wings and fly free.

NAH."
d2q09d,"NTA.

You planned yours first. Kids or no kids that does not change facts."
d2q54e,"Oh man! NTA. He's a complete hypocrite, so call him out on his hypocrisy.

Eventually, I hope both of you leave each other alone when it comes to eating, health, etc."
d2q972,"NTA - Dude, time to save yourself. Your mom clearly isn't even trying and the situation is toxic. She needs to sell her house and downsize and use the extra money to hire help and/or purchase things to make her life easier."
d2qa05,"NTA, he obviously was going to use your grade results to act like an ass towards you. He's projecting so hard he could play a movie on the moon."
d2qa9b,"NTA, but why would you do that? You'd only be sending the message that if your boyfriend doesn't want to clean up after himself, just wait long enough and you will do it for him. 

Instead, why don't you just tell him that the stuff needs to be gone by xx/xx/xx or you will be throwing it away next time the room gets cleaned. (Or if you aren't comfortable with throwing it out, put it in a box and place it someplace inconvenient like his bathroom sink or his closet or his side of the bed.)"
d2qc7s,"NTA, your case your rules."
d2qe14,"ESH

You can end a friendship if you need to. 

You’re painting a pretty bad picture of her, but I don’t see you trying to initiate conversation anywhere. In fact, when she asked you “What’s up?”, you said “nothing” instead of telling her what was up with you. 
You keep saying she’s “ignoring” you - but why does it have to be on her to engage you all the time?"
d2qfuj,Yeah it’s a dick move to not make sure your alarms are off when you live with others. YTA
d2ql6k,"NAH. Not unreasonable of your husband, and it seems like the young fella accepted it well and respectfully.

I think you're overthinking it because of the position you all started your relationship with the young man."
d2qteb,"I'm stuck between NAH, YTA, and ESH. 

NAH: Some people really enjoy the gift selecting and giving process and are good at it, others don't and aren't. He isn't you and it's not fair to expect him to be. Everyone doesn't show love the same way, you'll be a lot happier over the long haul if you see and appreciate the ways he IS good at showing his love for you instead of being disappointed that he doesn't do it exactly like you do.  (I'm sure someone else will have mentioned Love Languages by the time I'm done typing this, but look into it.)  


YTA: He DID think about you by proposing a vacation, then you IMMEDIATELY shut down his suggestion with some passive aggressive ""but that's just my thoughts and you can decide""  as the cherry on top. I see SO many couples where one person tries to do something the other person wants them to do and gets shut down or criticized immediately, so they stop trying and then get complained about because they don't try. It drives me batty.   


ESH: His ""FINE THEN I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT A VACATION"" reaction isn't great, either, it's teenager stuff. You could both use some work on communication (couldn't we all?)."
d2qupb,"NTA. Defending your sister was the right thing to do, he seems like he acts wayyy younger than he actually is. Maybe this will be a wake up call"
d2qvzw,"NTA - I know some cultures expect kids to pay their parents back for the cost of raising them, but any way you look at it that's ridiculous. You didn't ask to be born. As a parent I chose to take on the financial burden of raising my kids and it would be extortion to expect them to expect to repay the cost of my choices. Your money is yours. The only exception to this is if you're a working adult still living at home. In that case it's not unreasonable to pay rent/your share of living expenses but that's it."
d2qxwx,"NTA. You never agreed to the stipulations on the lease, only as a co-signer. They should have released that money back to you already."
d2r0ws,"YTA - bro you didn't even mention you were buying a quarter of a million dollar car to the person you live with?? It is your money, you can use it however you want as long as you still have enough that it does not effect you being able to pay your obligations.  That being said who tf buys a car without mentioning ""hey i may buy a car"" to their SO of 2 years they live with?  Bizarre."

d2r9p4,"NTA, because of exactly:

Honestly, this is basically validation seeking. I don't see how you could possibly be the asshole here."
d2rauz,"ESH.

You guys are kids, and kids generally suck. But the adults in this story completely fucked you over. Singling out certain kids and making them snitch on others is a surefire way to ostracise them from their peers. Your teachers are dickheads."
d2rev4,NTA what your teacher did was extremely rude and manipulative. You were told to purposely do poorly and then punished for it. I honestly think your reaction was completely justified. I would take it up with the principal.
d2rexy,"YWBTA - Everything you are describing is regular good friend behavior.

My partner used to exchange CDs with a guy he met online. I send local vegan treats to my friend in Sweden and she sends me some back. I smile when my friends message because they're frigging awesome. I love them. Why would I be friends with them if I didn't?

Seems like he's a person who shares a lot of your wife's interests, which you so respectfully referred to as ""BS"". They're just now reconnecting. It's understandable she's excited.

Maybe you feel threatened because they used to be romantic (when kids), maybe you feel like she's got a crush... Why not talk it out with her instead of going through the friend's wife (which is the weird thing)?

If she keeps telling you it's innocent, there's a very good chance it is. Instead of sabotaging your wife's friendships out of jealousy, why not offer to do one of her hobbies with her? Pick up a comic book, paint a figurine, do some cosplay."
d2rfcg,"YTA. Only a bit.  It seems like having a meeting when there is a disagreement such as this is the mature thing to do.  A lot of communication doesn't come through if you're not face to face.  If it's really because you're too busy, and not that you've already made up your mind,  just agree to go along with whatever is decided at the meeting."
d2rfco,"NTA
You have no obligation to reconnect with anyone, especially people who didn’t treat you well."
d2rgtd,YTA. That’s some psycho shit.
d2rhhb,"NTA. Haha, that's so fucked up. She brought your dog out and showered it in gifts and then expects to be reimbursed?? Haha, so dumb! This has rendered me speechless on how stupid of a premise that is.

Maybe she could buy the dog an iPad or something and then ask for reimbursement for that too? And she'll have to keep it safe from the dog so that it doesn't get scratched so maybe she can keep it at her house."

MOVE OUT. START LOOKING YESTERDAY.

This landlord broke laws by letting his wife enter without notifying you. A letter in your mailbox would have done it, eve hand delivered. He’s breaking his own rules by wanting to move in (as a couple) when he would not consider renting to one. It is YOUR home. Your stuff is allowed to be out. He is a bad landlord and you need to find another place to live because it sounds like he’s going to force you out or illegally evict you."
d2rude,NAH. Not your responsibility to take care of a special needs kids. Sounds like the school should be taking better care of the situation but at the same time if it's public school I bet it's difficult to accommodate for everyone all the time.

The amount of genetic overlap is so low that it is entirely legal to marry a first cousin. It might help you if you talked to your partner about it but it doesn't affect them at all so it isn't bad to withhold that information.

d2scbw,"NTA. If you dont feel comfortable with group/family therapy, dont do it. And your parents obviously arent in the right mindsets yet to have civil discussions with you if they can say mean things to you one week about a damn car and act like nothing happened the next. I suggest if anything you might want to look into seperate, on your own therapy to get help with problems that possibly arise from being raised in that living situation. Good luck with your parents, and I do hope you guys can at some point build a good relationship."
d2sfj1,"NAH

Look, to you it's irrational, hell to her it's probably irrational, but it doesn't change the fact that she is afraid. It doesn't really matter what she is afraid of, jusrt that she's afraid. Is that really someone you want behind the wheel at the moment? Endangering herself and others? Really?

There has to be a break point where her fears subside enough to attempt getting in the car, but you can't force her to that point. My judgement is NAH simply because it is irrational, but have a little empathy"
d2sgd1,"NAH, as a gay guy while i personally hate those questions they're usually innocent and with your backstory even i wouldn't mind. while it might have been better to ask in a private setting, if the gay friend was cool with it, it's not a big deal."
d2sijo,"NTA 

As long as her name is still on the house and not yours it’s her responsibility. It sounds like she knowingly gave you a train wreck so someone else would deal with it.

d2slg5,"NTA

Does your lease agreement have anything in it regarding pets?  But it is the pet owner's responsibility to make sure that their pets are behaving in a manner that is acceptable to all people living there.

d2tlkq,"NTA - I would not be surprised if you told them ""I am extremely disappointed in the unprofessional responses to my email requesting updates, only to find that the project was not completed to my satisfaction.

A bus going the opposite way of my morning commute stopped in the shoulder, and I passed him - promptly getting pulled over by the police. I was fined over $300 and looking back now, I deserved it.

d2uckz,"NAH. It's a big trip and it's understandable you'd be worried. However, your husband has been raising your stepson much longer than you and understands what his maturity levels are. 16 is definitely old enough to travel alone by plane, and if he moved when he was 11 he probably has a lot of friends he misses.

Try and meet in the middle with them. Have your stepson give you daily updates of the trip. It's normal to feel anxious but don't let those feelings get in the way."

d2uish,"YTA but very gently.

 Hear me out. As someone who has also lost a significant other, I totally understand where you're coming from. She was a big part of your life for a time, and those events obviously shaped you into who you are today. I'm sure you think of her often. It's entirely possible to fully love your wife, and still miss your ex. That said, I think you could've worded your post differently to be just a bit more sensitive to your wife. Something along the lines of ""remembering you today"" rather than ""I will always miss you"" would've relayed the same sentiment, without making your wife feel like you're pining after a past love. 

Other commentators are saying that your wife is insecure, which she might be, but it's a difficult situation for her to be in. She might logically understand that jealousy or insecurity over a dead woman is completely irrational, but that doesn't stop her from feeling that emotion. I've done the same dance with my current partner. I'd advise you to offer her some reassurance, and keep an open dialogue about your feelings and your ex with her, if you don't already."

d2ukpd,If I’m understand this correctly then I think you’re blind for not seeing that it’s your GF who is TA. If she can let someone talk her into doing all these things then your beef should be with her.
d2uov4,"I don't know how to rate this. [EDIT: yes I do. NTA.] But there was a communication breakdown.

She didn't want advice or help - she wanted an ear. That's reasonable - often people need to vent, to get out how they're feeling before they're in the mindset to try to solve the problem.

You saw your friend was in trouble, and you immediately tried to help. That's reasonable too.

But obviously those mismatched expectations led to conflict, hostility and anger. I'm not sure whose fault that is, if anyone's. All I can offer is that in the future, it's always best to let them talk it out, let them vent, let them feel like you aren't going to judge them for screwing up. And *then* ask if they're ready to hear solutions."
d2upo9,"Meg is, IMO, NTA.

I don't see anywhere in the story where Meg was informed up front that she was expected to pay for her drinks at a pregame party.  To top it off, she had one lousy shot, so its not like she butt-chugged half the keg by herself.

If I went to some rando's party because a mutual friend invited me, and then said rando tried to charge me like that, I'd be telling them where they could shove it as well."

She even admits herself she got your started but some how thinks after she stopped giving them to you that absolves her of any of the consequences of your actions going forward. Addiction is a disease. I'm sure your addiction made you at some points a really shitty person and you presumably burned a lot of people but some of that blame needs to go to your mom. Not all of it because you've obviously crossed into adulthood and are responsible for yourself but she's got a big stake in this.
d2uyil,NTA I've dealt with this before. When they keep doing it to themselves it's hard to keep hearing the same old story. I'd tell her just that. Come from a caring place if you can/want to when discussing it. But it's absolutely draining to hear the same shit over and over again.
d2v3d8,"NTA. If she was that concerned she should've asked the waiter or avoided it. There are plenty of dishes that contain nuts or are made in the presence of nuts and it's near impossible to tell if a specific dish has nuts.

YTA, and more than anyone else, YTA to yourself.

Everyone keeps on saying that the person cheated on has no obligation to forgive or move on. No obligation to forgive? Completely fair.

But it being okay not to move on? After two years?

Look, I'm going to be honest here. You need to move on - for your own sake. Clearly, your ex and her husband run in at least some similar circles as you if you'll were invited to the same party. In this situation, you were able to get them uninvited. 

That will not work every time.

Some people will choose to not uninvite already invited guests. Some will think you're being childish. And sometimes, you're going to get blindsided with them at a party.

*You cannot make you enjoyment of a social event conditional on your ex's attendance - or lack thereof - at said event.* It is not a healthy state of mind to be in.

Neither is the fact that you ""kept getting angry"" - like I said, I understand not forgiving either of them. But after two years, I honestly don't think it's healthy to hold on to your anger like that.

It would be one thing if this was a week, or 2 months, or 6 months post the cheating reveal and the breakup. But it's been two years. You holding on to your ex is not good for you - and you are holding on to her, even if it's through your worst memories of her. You can see the effect of doing so on AITA every once-in-a-while, where the crux of the question lies in the fact that one partner cannot get over being cheated on in the past, and become overbearing/paranoid/whatever with their new partner, causing issues in the relationship.

For your own sake, you need to move on. YTA to yourself all the way here - please consider telling the host not to prevent them from coming, seeing a therapist ASAP, and going to and enjoying the party with them present. Ignore them there. Have fun. You know how after a teen break up, a teen girl always tries to post the hottest and most fun pics on her Insta so the guy can see what he lost (no judgements, I was her once)? You need to do that. Live your best life, and don't let your ex have more control over your life than she already had.

You spent 8 years on her - 6 on your relationship, and 2 on holding on to your anger. Don't give her more of you.

EDIT: Spelling"
d2w724,"Yes, YTA. r/niceguys material right here. The signs she was ""into you"" was probably her just being nice and friendly and she was probably glad to find some guy friendships.

It's unfair to you for him to ignore their calls knowing that they will only revert to calling you.  It puts you in an uncomfortable position and it should not be your sole responsibility to maintain that relationship.  If he wants to completely cut them off then he needs to step up and tell them why."
