Your aunt won't learn anything if she doesn't do it herself.  What's the point of going back to school, then?

Proof-reading is one thing, but doing a total translation is another.

Plus how's she ever going to survive the final exam?"
d2xyvy,"YTA Be in the car before 710, you were both late it doesn't matter. Take responsibility for your actions"
d2y5uo,"NTA You have EVERY RIGHT to distance or end a toxic relationship, no matter how close.

When people show you who they are, believe them . Now, take a moment and remember who you are. You are a devoted parent who doesn't want their child harmed. You're not an asshole, you're a strong ass human being and your child is lucky you love them more than fear the disapproval of others. ."
d2y70f,"YTA - you offered, they were not at a restaurant...why is this even a post?"
d2yaen,[deleted]
d2yccx,"NAH. Kudos to him for wanting to be vegan, but it takes a LOT of research to properly balance a vegan meal, especially for growing children. You're the person in charge of purchasing and probably preparing food, so it's a-ok to say ""Wait until you're older.""

When my daughter decided she wanted to be vegetarian at the age of 10, she had a well thought-out reasoning, so I told her she could do it, but she would NOT be going vegan. The substitutes for protein and calcium are far too expensive, and I didn't have time or interest in learning the art of balancing vegan meals. 

Fast-forward 12 years, she is still vegetarian, and most of my meals are, too. It's less expensive, and there are some really, really good vegetarian recipes out there."
d2ycfl,"If your son is upset that you think his brother (not even, like, an aunt) should check in on him, he's not mature enough to be left alone. Even when I was 18 I was happy to have a sibling check in on me if I was alone, for company if nothing else. 

Stick to your guns. Your house, your rules, and you do what makes you comfortable."
d2yej8,Yeah YTA your friend is probably well aware of their medical condition and how it effects others. Honestly after hearing that I for one would likely be unselfconscious and resentful of your crass and careless remarks. Plus herpes is more common then most people think. 2/3 of the world's population is know to have it in some form of the disease. if you've ever had a cold sore you have a form of the herpes virus though not the genital kind.
d2yh0f,"YTA. Grade school gym class victories count for nothing, but participation is everything. You willingly excluded other classmates from participating fully, which makes you the a-hole."
d2yh8z,"NTA - I don’t understand how you think you’re the asshole here. Booths aren’t “owned” by anyone, it doesn’t matter who sat there the previous day, nor if they sat there for an ENTIRE month - you were there first, it’s your booth for the day."
d2yhsp,"ESH. You both suck for arguing in front of a customer. Unprofessional as hell. Also, the letter was petty. You were done working there, be the bigger person and just leave."
d2ynbq,NTA everything your boss is doing honestly sounds illegal. You should ask for a handbook and read it through to see if you're right.
d2ypfo,"NTA, obviously. Your friend is a shit friend and she’s trying to gaslight you. I’d look for better friends."
d2yt71,NTA. Nobody owns a name.
d2yup6,"NTA. The only a hole is the dad. He involves both of you when only one is at fault, and part of my definition of an a hole is that the consequences of their actions affect innocent people in a scenario intentionally. However, I do not think your mom and brother are. Your mom may have a different viewpoint, but she may only see certain things. I think your brother is being immature, but not yet to the point of being the a hole in this case. I would not be surprised though if he does become one or he rebels beyond rebelling."
d2yvh2,"I think it's your responsibility to bring this to HR.

She's not doing anything wrong, the gossipers are.
 
YTA"
d2yvqa,"Honestly, YTA. It’s not her fault for wanting to continue to talk to you and operating under the assumption that you’re still friends. Just because she doesn’t want you romantically doesn’t mean she can’t talk to you at all. You wouldn’t be super assholish if you just politely explained to her that you didn’t want to talk to her anymore and that you just didn’t like her. But it sounds like you didn’t do that. You called her names and provided no explanation. And now you tell her you hate her and continue to put her down with no explanation? You’re the asshole, dude."
d2yxhl,"YWBTA. Or, you would be the busy-body tattle-tale who doesn't mind their own business."
d2yxx8,"NTA. I do think your sister is an asshole for not letting you speak about your own interests and then turning around and becoming upset when you don't tell them anything. If they don't let you get a word in edgewise and then judge you when you finally do tell them about something, why would you want to try to tell them anything?

Some people just don't get along with their siblings. Some never did, some grow apart as adults. It's sad, but it's life. They're just people you happen to share DNA with, that doesn't automatically make people compatible friends for each other."
d2yz38,"YTA

hey what if we just let people be gay and live their lives the way they want to without dictating if they're ""gay enough"" because of LGBT history?"
d2z0i1,"Not gonna cast judgement but it's unfair to ostracize your uncle because you suspect him of sharing something that makes him uncomfortable. Him expressing discomfort to his mother about the situation isn't an affront against you or your choices of clothing, he could have just been talking earnestly about how he doesn't know how to manage the situation in a non-dictorial or judgemental manner. You're making assumptions about his motivations and are choosing a course of action based on the assertion that you're right in your assumptions. Also, you don't even know for certain if it is the uncle you suspect it to be."
d2z1t1,"NTA.

If you let him in, you're not getting him out again."
d2z2r2,"YTA.  Instead of swinging your dick, you should have talked with the chef about HIS employees.

You ruined your chances of being a good fit for this job.  Time to start looking for a new one."
d2z4pr,"YTA.  She said she would need to check with the office, which is correct.  A sub can’t just let a student leave because they say they have somewhere to be.  All teachers operate in loco parentis, which basically means you are assuming responsibility for all students.  You should have waited patiently and let her check."
d2z6dh,NTA. There’s no point in continuing to date someone with a kid when children are a dealbreaker for you. And the fact that he called you a bitch leads me to believe that you’ve dodged a bullet.
d2z6s4,"YTA

so basically, you just want someone to sit there and be a sponge for your negativity? do you actually want support from someone or do you just want him to sit there silently like a piece of furniture while you complain?"
d2z815,"YTA. I didn’t see anywhere in your post where she misrepresented how she is going to spend the money. If people chose to donate, that’s their choice. The girl is trying to beat cancer. You should be happy for her, not hating on a GoFundMe page."
d2z9tl,"ESH.  Going into your room and not asking isn't cool, you fixed the problem with the lock.  It really should have ended there.  They would need to ask, and then you could either okay it or decline.  Banning them from all interaction with your pets and causing house drama was unnecessary."
d2zarg,"ESH. Them for not being more careful with infants. You for losing it to the point where the police were being called. Hopefully you are pulling your child out immediately. Based on the response you got, I wouldn’t trust them not to be punitive towards your baby."
d2zc3f,"YTA

The problem isn't that you gave them video games, it is that you undermined her authority. She had made a decision, but you disregarded that decision.

If you felt she was being too harsh, then you need to talk to her and not act against her.

You are a partnership, and you need to provide each other support. Because next time she tries to punish the kids or enforce discipline the kids will go to you because they know you are going to let them do what they want.

""All the kids are playing videogames"" is a pretty weak excuse for you to unilaterally override her decision."
d2zc7r,NTA.  You aren't telling him no because he is depressed.  You are telling him no because he doesn't respect your boundaries.
d2zfhj,"NTA/NAH..... some dudes are just wired weird when it comes to matters of the heart. He may have not opened up about how much he misses her and he’s been radio silent for a week, if he’s a good looking guy crushing it and he just ghosted after something as trivial as this triggered this reaction give him space. He will realize his error eventually and because you’re like family you guys will figure it out. Sometimes a broken heart and paranoid thoughts make people bug out. Best of luck buddy"
d2zgmq,"YTA. You have no control over what she posts, nor should you. She’s an adult, and has been for several years. The pictures you described (bikinis) sound fairly typical, not “very slutty,” (which, by the way, a woman has the right to post photos that are as revealing as she wants) and you shaming her and basically all women (“disgusting”? Suuuuper judgy) isn’t helping your case."
d2zkcx,"NTA - this sounds like his problem not yours. 
Also, I think it’s common law at this point. So using wife is appropriate"
d2znak,"NTA - your house, your rules."
d2zpin,"I'm leaning pretty hard on the NTA fence here because how the heck do you not see the yellow tape at the front of the driveway??? 

However, INFO did your newly paved driveway look damaged in anyway? I think this would figure into whether you are TA or not. I'd be pissed too OP."
d2zqml,"NTA

Don't give any type of pet as a gift to someone outside your own household."
d2zr3g,"Sorry but YWBTA. That's a pretty long stretch of time to leave children of that young age for something that is ultimately 100% selfish. It would be understandable if you had to leave for that amount of time in order to support your family in some way.

You can't break this hike up into smaller time increments?"
d2zsl5,"ESH. Just...stop hanging out with her. You guys OBVIOUSLY don't like hanging out with each other. If you can't say anything nice about friends when writing an AITA post, just leave them alone."
d2zt51,ESH. You’re both ridiculously immature and vindictive. Holding on to nudes for nefarious purposes is a really scummy thing to do.
d2zwf1,"NTA. Put your foot down now. You raised the scholarship money. It's time to stop teaching him it's okay to make petty demands that change the entire course of your life. He's not a toddler.

Also, honestly, I'd do everything in my power to go to college in *any* other state if I were in MO, too. I'm not bashing the entire culture but you want your youth years to be free, happy and in an environment that encourages challenging assumptions and finding the best thoughts no matter who they come from."
d2zyui,"NTA though don't expect it to have much of an effect on whether she pays you back. I'd save the messages (if you still have them) where you told her you expected to be paid back. But, if she's the kind of person who would expect you to just let her slide on it, I'm not sure she would change that mindset if she signs an IOU. It isn't like you would take her to court over it. 

Best of luck. I do hope she repays you but I have little faith in people in general."
d2zzbm,NTA.  Tough for him that he's homeless.  Room mates don't get to unilaterally move a male into a female only apartment.
d2zzke,"NTA as long as you're keeping it totally factual.

That having been said, you better be 100% solid about what information you're providing, and have everything documented somewhere to back it up.  There's a reason why most companies nowadays keep reference information to a bare minimum (""Mr. X worked with us from x-date to y-date"").  It's to avoid the risk of being sued for providing a poor reference.

Are you sure you can't pawn this off to HR?"
d300nr,"UPDATE: 
I told my husband I could only do it if I can say the following: 
I don't think he's a bad dad. I do think he's a bad husband, and thought this before any of this happened, but being a crappy husband doesn't make someone a bad dad.  I believe he deserves to see his children.  But I think until his medication has been corrected, he is seeing a therapist regularly, and has had a mental health professional sign off on it, visits should be supervised. 
My husband insists he is working on getting his meds right and that I haven't seen him in 5 months so I can't judge based on the last time I saw him. WHICH I SAY IS A PRETTY GOOD ARGUMENT FOR NOT BEING A WITNESS.
He now doesn't think I should do it because I might hurt his case. But he still thinks I'm the asshole"
d303t4,"ESH - the guy sounds like a complete dick, but it is not your house and not your concern."
d303zz,"NTA - I was leaning the other way until you mentioned that one of your siblings is being left off the hook for a school field trip which makes it feel like this isn't as an important / big deal, or the family would be wanting their attendance as well.    I will agree it's not about your relationship with your great-grandma (or lack there of) - but rather about being there for your loved ones who are grieving her lost.  

I agree you should go to the viewing at least if at all possible for a brief time (and I hate to say that because I sympathize with your fear of funerals...the truth is though that unfortunately you may have to attend quite a few throughout your life).  

So my advice would be to go ... but my judgement is you're not the asshole if you don't."
d30a0c,"YTA

If you would hold her to it (and you have) you owe her the cash and are a huge asshole if you hide it. 

Don't make the bet if you are not willing to pay."
d30bpb,NTA. Who the fuck is gonna get that mad over not picking up the phone? He's a dick. Get away from that psycho.
d30c4a,">What's going on here? 

Great fucking question."
d30clt,NAH.  You can ask....and they can pass on you for it.
d30o79,"NTA, this is ridiculous. You are not obligated to cancel your life because your parents are too cheap to pay for a kennel service."
d30psu,Nta.  Selfless and having boundaries are not mutually exclusive.
d30vyu,"YTA for hitting him with 500$ a month, that's ridiculous seeing as his mortgage is 3800 bucks and your current rent is 2000. Maybe not 50/50 but that was a completely ridiculous offer and started this process off on the wrong foot."
d30wfe,NTA you deserve your privacy and your father crossed the line by being so controlling. Telling him the truth was a great step but I think he needs to take a step back and listen to you. By ignoring you he's honestly not doing a great job at parenting
d3108y,"YTA. You gave her something that you admit can’t be easily carried in a bag when she also had a full day ahead of her. She made it clear it was going to be a hassle to carry around, but you didn’t care. You should have asked her what would have been a good time to give it to her."
d311dm,"NTA.
Others say you should have talked to the neighbor first, and you could have, but choosing not to do so doesn't make you the asshole.

That's your parking spot. You literally pay money to for something you can't even use because of this guy.

The landlord already told him to stop using it, so if he will ignore the landlord, chances are slim he would pay you any attention if you had tried to confront him about it yourself.

Edit: typos"
d313nl,NTA and I agree with the other commenter that counseling might be a good option for you two. Going off birth control behind your back is low-kew crazy 🙃
d3180u,"YTA Come on. Truth or Dare is supposed to be light-hearted and fun, not used to uncover painful secrets. If they chose not to tell you, they had a reason and you should have respected that. I hope you apologized."
d31cjt,"NTA For someone who's supposed to be body-positive, she's real selective about what bodies get to have positivity. If she didn't want shit thrown back at her about her body, maybe she shouldn't have badgered you about yours."
d31gzm,[deleted]
d31ko5,"> idk am i in the wrong here? 

I mean obviously not.

What scenario has you being an asshole in this situation?"
d31l3k,NTA not appropriate and could put a wedge between you and him and make the daughter uncomfortable later when she knows
d31mcy,"Don't ask, there isn't any point. If he is so dense he cannot understand that dating your brother's problematic sloppy seconds is gonna be an issue for you and your friend group you should just move on. NTA."
d31mju,Lol I mean YTA. Cuz you could’ve just had your boss talk to him then see if his behavior changed. I doubt you would’ve gotten fired for his wrongdoings.
d31n40,NAH Build her a she shed for her hobby?
d31rqd,"NTA  
I'm sorry, man. That $45 is gone. Usually there is a down payment, then the rest is paid once the piece is complete. But this girl is taking you for a ride.  
Tell her you wish to cancel, request $30 of the $45 be returned.  
Write that you have been patient, but she is several month over-due. If she doesn't return the money, you'll be forced to post it on social media which could hurt her reputation for future commissions.  
I know, it's not a slam dunk.  
To be honest, you will 99% not see the money or the finished product. The best thing to do is atleast ATTEMPT to get your money back, then just move on.  
I know it not what you want to hear, but there are really no great choices in this position.  
And lastly, don't tell your gf about it. She will be disappointed that she didn't get the item, and disappointed that you gotten taken advantage of.  Just move forward and get this girl back when you can."
d31rvc,"NTA - She crossed the line on ""protecting your safety"" big time. You just watched a damn Youtube video so what's the deal? EVERYONE does that."
d31t57,NTA - You straight up told her no sow why are you TA?
d31tuu,"ESH because she might have a irrational, annoying phobia but you signed up for dealing with it when you started dating her. You’re allowed to set spider killing boundaries, but you shouldn’t invalidate her fear."
d31vlg,"YTA for expecting payment when it wasn't discussed. I realize a lot of people may disagree with this because it is based on Western ideals of politeness and middle to upper class individuality, but poorer households and non-White households are way more collective, so offering payment when *you* offered to watch her without discussing payment is an absolute asshole move. Tack on the fact humans aren't actually mind readers and you're just fully in the wrong.

Instead of being passive aggressive about it maybe instead say ""hey, would you mind pitching me a twenty every month? I don't mind watching your kid, but it would help offset the cost of care for snacks!"" and if she agrees everyone is happy! If she rejects then you can go the ""Then I don't think I can watch her"" route."
d31xn1,"NTA. This is your dad’s call, not yours. Your sister is old enough to get a job and her own place. If she wanted to stay with you guys she needed to change her behavior. It sounds like she potentially has a problem with alcohol. I hope she gets the help she needs."
d31yek,"NTA, but don't tell her off. Just make it clear that she is not ever allowed to take your clarinet anywhere or authorize repairs. Full stop."
d32193,NTA But if this is to be a long term relationship this sounds very uneven and weird. He wants you to pay for obvious wear and tear on a car you drive once in a while??? Not cool and weird when he didn’t ante up on something that he broke of yours that was clearly NOT wear and tear.
d326ds,NTA. Your neighbor has no business owning pets if she isn’t going to care for them beyond their kitten years. I’d also contact the humane society and let them know that the cats aren’t being cared for so it can be looked into.
d328tf,Are you serious ? She sounds exhausting.
d328y9,NTA. Your boyfriend is the definition of unappreciative. When someone gives you a gift you say thank you and leave it at that.
d32age,"YTA 

Your dad has elected not to tell them. Respect his choice. 

He can deal with them asking for shit. He's an adult who makes his own choices based on all factors not all of which  he needs to explain to you or anyone else. you don't need to ""save him from dealing with your siblings."
d32ayl,"NAH. You’re entitled to your feelings and wouldn’t be out of bounds for discussing those feelings with her. That said, breastfeeding isn’t inappropriate and pictures of a child breastfeeding aren’t sexual or inappropriate."
d32eyt,"ESH- your mother should respect your wishes, but you need to learn self-control. You'll get more respect by being firm and calm."
d32gbo,"NTA, absolutely. Just be aware that how you tell her this sort of stuff will affect your relationship with her and/or your father. If you don't much care about that, then there's no real need to worry."
d32l4b,YTA - Don't make a suggestion on your bf's birthday unless you are paying.
d32lit,"NTA pigs are very smart and social and take a LOT of work, she absolutely should not get a pet pig unless all the housemates agree and can provide for it all the space and attention it will need"
d32m4v,"ESH, but your still an asshole  and obviously proud of it."
d32npn,"YTIdiot  (if that’s not too inflammatory) 

I would encourage you to avoid things like this in the future simply because taunting someone you dont know to be mentally stable in a metal death machine as a pedestrian is not a great idea. I don’t remember who first told me this, but I’ve always remembered, “right of way doesn’t matter if you’re dead.”"
d32nvx,NTA. You did good.
d32ogk,YTA. Her laughter and the existence of her social life pisses you off? God forbid she has friends! She didn’t do anything to “disrespect” you. This post is like one giant red flag.
d32ql1,NTA.  Just send your cousin a card. You are not obligated to go to this wedding.  Do not set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Protect yourself and stay away from them.
d32qm7,"I'm going to say NAH because it doesn't sound like you've spoken to her about it yet and hence we don't know what her reaction or response would be. You are not the asshole for wanting some time to yourself to do whatever, whether it's playing games or sleeping in. Talk to her, you have every right to have some alone time even in a relationship."
d32yn2,"NTA but I suggest you speak with a lawyer as soon as possible and get their advice on whether you post anything. What he’s doing is illegal and you are entitled to some of that money so you can actually use it to care for your daughter, but you don’t want to hurt your chances of getting that money in any way legally, so consult someone first about what you can possibly do."
d32zyc,"NTA, screw people who screw others, intentionally or not. They deserve absolutely no politeness"
d333mv,"NTA. If you’re cleaning up your mistakes, that’s the very definition of being responsible for them. Is your husband being an asshole or is it just a breakdown in communication due to lack of understanding English?"
d3363m,NTA Hard no! Good lord why would you wanna watch the paper trail of your ex go on possible dates
d336fq,"NTA. you told her once it was over, so it isn't like you kept a secret from her for years. You did what you needed to do to aide your recovery"
d337nx,"NTA - That instructor was very unprofessional. Be careful and pace yourself next time. Before you go back, if you go back, let that instructor know you had an undiagnosed blood pressure issue that made you think you were going to pass out/almost passed out, and next time that you should be able to leave unmolested.

This isn't grade school. Instructors acting like they are entitled to justifications for people leaving early are just practicing bad business. You're paying them to teach you good form, this isn't Martial arts where discipline and a teacher-subservient relationship is implied. And even Eastern Martial arts taking that kind of angle on the customer-instructor relationship is weird to me.

In any event. You are 100 percent fine. Unless the blood pressure thing happens again. But that could just be your body getting used to strenuous activity and being used in New ways. I know that exactly happened when I started running. Focus on consistent breathing.

Either"
d33843,"If you know your mom takes pictures at inappropriate moments, wtf you mooning her for??"
d338et,NTA at all. Honey your mom is abusive and it doesn't matter what her damage is that no excuse. Have you considered living with your dad?
d3396q,"NTA. Your step-mother should be more understanding and lenient with you, considering your OCD. Your reasoning is fairly logical, it does make more sense to take it out later anyways. Good thing you stood your ground. If she’s that particular about the trash, why doesn’t she just take it out herself then?"
d33e3n,"NAH 

But don’t go telling her she can’t. Talk through the financials of the situation in a way that helps her understand you guys just can’t afford to do this. It’s sad, and I feel bad for her. She won’t have biological children, but you guys can foster and make a huge difference in an existing child’s life."
d33i6w,YTA adults in relationships talk to each other. You could have told her you needed a day with no responsibility. She may disagree. Then you set a boundary. This is how you adult. You don’t lie by omission then when you get caught decide to actually lie next time. This is a recipe for a really short relationship.
d33rbv,"NTA
I might get hate for this but if they really hurt you why do you have to forgive or accept their apology? This guys obviously homophobic and maybe he changed but it still doesn’t change that he bullied you enough that you thought about leaving. Don’t listen if you don’t want too."
d33tdr,"YTA. Pick your battles. She’s the breadwinner, probably exhausted from her day. Doesn’t want to deal with that shit at 5am. 
She was probably being so dismissive of your frustrations (it’s only a charger) because I’m guessing she was woken up and frustrated that she was woken up for such a petty reason. 
I get her taking your charger is frustrating as fuck (gf did the same thing to me until I got a wireless charger) but cut her some slack."
d344ql,"NTA Your father is making the right choice by insisting on separate parties. If your mother is so selfish and immature she wants you to tell your dad you'll miss your sister's bat mitzvah if she's not invited tells me that she's not in the right place to merge these kinds of events. She has no business getting you involved in her long dead relationship with your father.

Maybe down the road you could try getting them together on a less important occasion, like 4th of July or something. Don't test the waters with your sister's bat mitzvah. Let your parents work their messes out on their own."
d346b7,"Nah

The cleaning will benefit you all though so I think you should equally pay for it"
d346rd,NTA but you need to be a lot more professional in the emails you sent. Saying 'I'm sorry but I will be busy this weekend and won't be able to do this. Please give more more advance notice in future so I can plan accordingly.' Putting in the extra jabs about feeling unappreciated is out of place and detracts from the main theme of the email.
d34827,"ESH. You should force him to sleep longer. Sleep in. It's a road trip. Get there 3 hours late. No biggie. Also, you shouldn't try to drive. If you're not on the list, the insurance will not cover you. Don't make that mistake."
d34adq,"NAH but I think you might have to be one. I'd rather be temporarily upset and disheartened and learn from that, rather than having a continuing problem I wasn't aware of.

Part of me wants to say ""but if you know she can't reach those places, then is there a point bringing it up?"" but then maybe it is worth bringing it up so she can understand the need to tackle the issue by tackling other issues maybe. Difficult situation and I don't envy you. Hopefully you can find a way of doing it sensitively or constructively."
d34b5t,YTA. Just because you had a shitty customer doesn’t mean you get to fuck with their order. You’re also just proving her right that her order is always wrong.
d34haf,"ESH Your friend should just let you pay or at least communicate about this, you shouldn't have bothered us with those six paragraphs of completely unrelated stuff at the start of your post."
d34srm,YTA for accepting in the first place when you already knew full well what kind of person the bride is. Now you'll be fucked if you back out and fucked if you don't.
d355ck,"YTA. You sound like you don't trust him at all. If you carry on being ""not too keen"" on your boyfriend going out without you, you may find yourself alone full time."
d35ar4,"ESH. Calling out hypocrisy isn't license to be unnecessarily cruel.

Now you're both just bad friends and listeners. Congratulations"
d35g24,"YTA.

He asked if he could park there and you said it was fine. It's understandable that he would be under the impression that this would mean he wouldn't get a ticket.

There's no reasonable way he could have known the rules for your parking space, so you saying it was OK would obviously be taken by him as a sign that it wouldn't get him a ticket.

You, as the 'owner' of the space and resident should have been aware of the rules, so you're the reason he has a ticket.

If you want to keep the friend, pay the ticket.

>Does he not have any liability to check?

He did check. With you - the owner of the parking spot."
d35r8x,"NTA. 

That’s a shit situation.  Likely she was hangry and not like that normally but 100% her fault for taking it out on a fast food employee. You guys are way over worked and underpaid."
d35sai,"YTA Had to read this a couple of times. Yes, if they simply assumed you were going to pitch in, that would be assholic, but off the top you said that you three regularly buy one big present for your mother for her birthday. Then you clearly had a discussion about a gift, i.e. the phone call where you discussed how much you were willing to spend. I'm not sure what the befuddlement was about—they clearly surmised, reasonably, if incorrectly, that you were willing to chip it (like you do usually) the amount you said you would be willing to pay. That's pretty considerate, even if they misunderstood you. So you sisters aren't the assholes.

Fine, a real inconvenience. But if getting a present together is a regular thing, it's on you to check in with you sisters about this too. It's a hassle to the one planning all of this. Now your sisters have to cough up the difference and create something awfully awkward in front your mom. ""Yeah, me and my sis pitched in for this.... dunno about the other sis. lol. Happy birthday!"""
d35sar,"NTA. You're not responsible for assisting anyone on the roadside, but you also didn't do anything malicious to her while she knowingly did so to you. Responding with passive neutrality to an asshole's plight doesn't make you one."
d35tth,"NAH here.

You don't want to contact with your mom, who have mostly no relationship. You did it of your own volition, although it seems to be affected by your dad's choice which is not a bad thing altogether. You don't want to pursuit a relationship with her (and to an extent, your half sister), it is ok to not contact.

Your mom might have done a lot of bad things in the bad, to your dad (and maybe to you too). But recovering from it then becoming a better person and contacting her own daughter (allowed by your dad) is not an assholery action at all. She is beckoning you to write back, but she have never forced you or got aggressive about it, right?

Also, you can write a letter and politely to tell her to not write for you anymore if you feel pressured by your mother unintentionally. You can also ask your dad to block it for you, since you are a minor now. Don't be hard on yourself and your mother, both of you have feelings and want to express it, no one is asshole here."

Say it with me everyone, dont touch other peoples property without permission, you are not the building manager or the custodian, call someone who deals with the building and let it go"
d3663k,[deleted]
d366u3,Two way split is not fair. You need a conversation about you leaving. YWNBTA
d36882,"YTA, your kids don't know why you left or when you're coming back. Needing time to clear your head is fine but you need to at least communicate about it with your family first."
d36iqx,"YTA, you probably should have told him something like ""Hopefully you can make it, but I'm going anyway"""
d36k6b,"NTA. They are, and I would have cut contact immediately after the whole situation was done. That’s their fucking child. He needed them, and they treated him like dirt. Like a chore, or a way to make money. Even if that’s the only terrible thing they’ve ever done, they’re not people I would let around my family."
d36kfl,"YTA

Taking a guess here, Jessie's husband probably can't go until the bigger party for one reason or another. So using that as an example as to why Molly's SO can't come is flimsy at best. If you insist on this it very well could damage your friendship pretty badly. This is more or less made even worse by the fact you're allowing children who could be disruptive along."
d36pjf,I suspect this might backfire tbh and cause a huge issue it seems a waste of time picking up all that rubbish just to pile it up in an effort to shame him. Obviously the gf was struggling with her mental health but do you think he could also be depressed? I’d probably just clean up and keep encouraging him to help out and then enforce a schedule once it was clean to keep it that way.
d36ty8,"NAH, but older sisters have been dressing up their little brothers for fun since forever. It’s not that strange."
d36vrl,"NTA. Your girlfriend should know better. If her niece was over the age of 18, I would feel different. She’s still very young. 

Julie’s obviously trying to make sure they are safe but should never have offered to supply her weed."
d36w65,NTA the cat sounds anxious and miserable and if he isnt abke to care for it he shouldnt have it.
d36xza,"NTA. Honestly at 11, you're there just in case any emergency comes up, and your sister is getting childcare at a steal for £5 and is only worth it as you're able to supplement that time with your actual job. Especially since the babysitting is inconsistent, and more of a favor. This is encroaching r/ChoosingBeggars"
d36z57,"NTA. She basically told you that she's - without asking you - taken over the house for herself on a day she knows is very important to you, and traditionally you have the house for. She's more than welcome to ask for the house, but seeing as she didn't she's declared war on you and shitting on her party is fair game if you ask me.

Ofc, you could avoid a lot of heartache and bad blood and probably enjoy the day a lot more if you relocate your own party to somewhere else."
d370hv,"Honestly, I'm going to ironically suggest that you be *more* of an asshole. If someone asks you a dumbass question, then treat them like a right dumbass. Let them know how thick they are for not solving a basic problem (like trying to Google something or sign into emails? Cmon dudes), and you'll probably notice them stop asking."
d372o9,"ESH

He gave you notice, and unless this religious event is super offensive to you for whatever reason, sometimes you go to things for people you love. He gave you notice that something was going on, and asked you to clear put your schedule. 

Really the big reason I'm putting blame everywhere is because he called you entitled for wanting notice for having them want you to go to things. I also don't love the because I said so argument - that is for three year olds after an hour long run of ""Why?"" They should be able to give a better explanation for someone older."
d374wb,"NTA *yet* - if you gather them all and talk it out (e.g. you've been left out somehow and would like maybe a few of them to join you to avoid being alone with the weird kid) then that's fine. It's not like they'd refuse, either, for risk of seeming like a massive dick.

What you don't wanna do is be a bitch about it - that'll only alienate your new friends. Hopefully you can sort it out, but be ready to be a bigger man and maybe room with the weird kids if you have to."
d3781z,"NTA.

This is one of those lose-lose situations, but as terrible a thing as death is I don't think it's good for anyone if you cancel the party and all sit at home feeling miserable.

Do be careful, though - I'm sure the bereaved kid won't be too happy if you're all going nuts and getting smashed and banging on the tables or whatever fucked up shit you plan on doing the day after his dad's funeral."
d37c17,"NTA.  You could have done more but you did at least recognize what was happening and tell somebody else about it, who then handled it.  That's not nothing."
d37gir,"For a start, YTA for the clickbait title.

Secondly, ESH. You can't control your SO regardless of how fishy their friends seem. You have to trust them not to cheat without needing to supervise their every move, and If you can't do that then hey-ho, you need a new partner."
d37h9i,"NTA.

Sit your boyfriend down make it clear that those are *your* boobs he's occasionally allowed to touch, not *his* boobs. And that as such, he has *zero* right to tell you when you're allowed to take them out as long as you're not being sexual with other people."
d37kcl,"NAH

You and your parents need to learn not to take things so fucking personally.

Sit them down and explain to them that your lack of communication does not in any way reflect on how you feel about them. If anything, it reflects how you feel about you.

Then you have to realize that giving you money is not an insult. It is an act of love. You are not a failure for receiving it. You've already proven you can live with out it.

---

There are a lot of red flags here suggesting that you need therapy. If your husband is not getting any, so does he.

The mentions of feeling shame and embarrassed are the ones that really hit. You should never act out of shame. Either own the choices you make, or figure out why you feel shame and fix it. If at any point you are making what you feel are the best choices based on what you know and who you are, there is no reason for shame."
d37keu,NTA: She's already been fucking him if you had to give her an ultimatum to cut him off.
d37pks,The smell of kimchi cam trigger migraines for me. YTA. You don't eat stinky food in a shared space unless you know people are fine with it.
d37up2,"NTA. I'd just go the simple route of saying ""he doesn't want the responsibilities to stick to the requirements of living here""."
d37vfu,"NTA

>I know I'm being taken advantage of. I know some of these parents conspire to shuffle their kids around each other's sitters for free childcare.

Yeah that's definitely what's happening, you gotta set some boundaries"
d381fm,"NTA at all. If you go to pick up your food, then you're under no obligation to tip. Sounds like you just came across a rude manager, nothing on you."
d381m1,"NTA

She may be organising it but it is *for you*. She shouldn't be inviting people you don't want there, and if she can't tell (either by knowing you well enough or just plain common sense) who those people would be she should have consulted you.

Honestly, I would be inclined to cut her as matron of honour. But that is just me, and it would probably cause you more problems."
d384ho,"Well you have to ask yourself would your friend be upset if they found out that you were able to play any game they bought for free. If the answer is yes then YTA. If you dint think they would care at all, then NTA"
d38683,"NTA. If you hadn't had the kid with you I may lean more towards ""just check what she wants"" but your duty of care is to the kid, not strangers."
d387sq,NTA - IF you were hired as a barista and it says so in your contract. I doubt there will be a notice period if you have only been there 3 days. You’re actually protecting the public. At the very least you should hold a basic food hygiene certificate if you are going to be handling food never mind cooking or preparing it.
d389hf,"NTA; but it sounds like there are some easy alternatives:

1. Get a coffee maker at home (saves money in the long run anyway)
2. Tell her your desired schedule, and to set time goals to work out your schedules
3. Tell her to drive every other day/week if her anxiety is that bad"
d38a1d,NTA your child's bday is for your child's friends. Your MIL sounds like a clown tbh
d38b72,"NTA.  You don't bring gifts or donations to someone and demand to be feed.  And, no one should expect parents of a newborn to entertain/serve dinner right in the first month."
d38bxa,"Im gonna say YTA but only a little one. Like, yes. Winning is the goal. But simultaneously, you are in a team. A team thats more than you two. How would you feel if you signed up for a team and were never allowed to play? Shit stings. I was a terrible batter in softball, but you better believe I got to go to bat at least once a game.


If you didnt want to have the possibility of sharing the team, you shouldnt have invited 2 others to yours. Let them participate man."
d38c97,"> she’s left people over a lot less

Classic manipulation. Open your eyes. NTA"
d38f7x,"NTA. 

It is definitely an asshole thing to go meet a guy who has set boundaries when you have full intentions to break those boundaries. He's unwilling to do them due to his religion, so trying to seduce him to go against his religion is a major asshole move."
d38gum,"INFO: So you are renting a room from your girlfriend, but she has her sister and her best friend both sleeping in it every night? Are they only there to sleep, or do they use it during the day too? Does their being there affect you in any way other than rent? 

Depending on what the answers are to these, this could be YTA or NAH."
d38i34,"NTA

You've paid about $19000 in rent **while** your sister has paid nothing? Oh hell no. Your parents are being ridiculous, and your sister is a user.

How financially difficult would it be for you to leave? I wouldn't want to stay with them if it was me.

Edit: People keep pointing out that OP has paid roughly $38000 in the last 4 years. It isn't that I can't do maths, I was making the point that OP paid $19000 *while the sister has lived there for free over the last two years*.

Edit 2: my first ever silver! Thank you kind stranger! And my first comment thanking a stranger for silver, so many firsts in one day!"
d38ihf,"YTA but not for watching movies with your son. 

>it's a guy thing

No it fucking isn't. 

>that's why I ignore her protests

You're completely dismissing the wishes of your co-parent? Lol. Yeah. That attitude is gonna work out for you. Grats. You're completely the asshole."
d38l44,"NTA, but maybe you should consider finding a new DM.

So you killed a few Town Guards. The story can and should continue from there, but your DM took his ball and went home. That’s amateur hour. Good DMs expect that their careful plans will get cratered by a random act from the party; it’s called ‘improvisation’ and it is an absolute requirement for any game I play (or run, as I DM on the regular)."
d38lw0,"YTA


>""she has never been embarrassed about it.""


Guess what??? She's going be embarrassed about it now. Having a small chuckle is one thing, but carrying for minutes is called being an ASSHOLE."
d38omf,"In my experience in catholic churches, alot of people are very annoyed by anyone whispering, etc. so I think YTA. You're an adult. If you don't want to go to church, then just don't."
d38p4i,"ESH. That child should not have left broken toys in your yard, obviously. But what you did is juvenile and un-neighborly. If you're trying to set a good example of responsible adulthood for the children in your neighborhood, you're failing spectacularly."
d38prl,"NTA


What they're doing is selfish, and really all you did was sit in your room in normal sleeping attire.

This makes me so glad my university had separate bedrooms."
d38sio,"NTA - you promised 3 months when you were offered a full time job. If he's not holding up his side of that agreement, you shouldn't have to hold up yours."
d38v0m,"YTA. You have not really demonstrated how this actually afffects you other than you just don't like it. Is this having a detrimental impact on your studies? Even if you said it was, idk if I would believe you. I don't see how it possibly could. 

I mean, maybe she is a bad professor on top of being vulgar but that doesn't really seem like it's the case and it would be unrelated even if it were. 

I think what you have to realize is that this is just a preference you have. What she's doing isn't inherently wrong, it just bugs you for whatever reason. 

Sometimes in life, you have to put up with things you don't like and that doesn't mean throw a little bitch fit about it. 

You're being immature here, the grown up thing would be to just put up with it and do your best to learn the material. I've had professors who were extremely professional but unbearably boring. I didn't like it, but I didn't point it out to them and I certainly didn't go to the internet in search of validation. 

Be grateful you have a professor who cares enough to even try and make class a little less boring."
d392we,"Do. Not. Marry. Him. 

&#x200B;

NTA, and get out of this. Split your finances, and if he has issues with paying things, it's only on him."
d395xb,NTA. Your parents are asses for not recognizing their child’s birthday...
d39dmr,"NAH. They asked for a tax form thats used when traveling abroad. Why would it be racist to assume they were? Does it mean they were? No. Does it matter? No. They asked for a form, and you assumed they wanted it for the reason most people want a form."
d39kkp,ESH - He should still help with the chores if he lives there/eats there and you shouldn’t have said his GF looks like a 50yr old woman.
d39qf2,"ESH

It's your property, deal with it. If my dog was doing the same it'd be my problem. 

They also should not have fed them treats. 

In addition, cats are devistating to local wildlife and birds, they should not be kept outside."
d39qxr,YTA. You put your belief in a short term relationship and lust for your now ex-GF over the well-being of someone who was supposedly your best friend who you *knew* at one point was being mistreated by this girl. The best you can hope for is a heartfelt apology but I highly doubt she’d find you sincere.
d39r8x,"NTA, he shouldn't have done that in the first place, you were in the right to do whatever you wanted to do"
d39sbq,"NAH: You both have needs and concerns. They need respect and empathy, and you need to know what's going on.

Hedge your bets. Don't ask yet, but start looking for a new job anyway.  In the meantime, seize the opportunity to take charge and be proactive within your current company.  They need a leader, and that leader can be you during a time when the family can't really concentrate on the business. The worst case is that your current place stays open, you look awesome for taking charge a little bit, and you don't need to bother taking a different job."
d39x5x,NTA he should’ve called the cops and reported this guy skipping out on the fare if he was outside the house he entered. People call cabs for others all the time.
d3a0tz,"NTA. 

If your mother wasn't thinking of your safety first I'm glad at least you were. You did good in doing something about it, even if they don't see it. 

I'm sorry they're not being more understanding about it."
d3a1ya,"YTA for not being direct. It's not that hard to write ""Please refer to my prior e-mail for this information. If you have any further questions, please schedule a meeting so we can review the information."" I understand it gets frustrating, but directness gets further than passive aggression. It helps nip things in the bud."
d3a2x2,"NAH 

As the child of divorced parents--it's really really disruptive to have to pick up your life and move every other weekend. You are entitled to have friends and a life. Just explain to him exactly how you feel--that you don't want to cut ties with him but it's hard to be away from your friends/life twice a month in a town where you feel kind of bored and lonely.

But your dad isn't an asshole for being sad and upset because he's missing out on time with you. Can you figure out some alternative way to spend time with him? Pick out some events to do together, or see if he can come to your city during the week to get dinner? Or pick one weekend where you will go over there and you guys plan some quality time together? Can you guys find some activities that you would enjoy in his town so you can go there and enjoy the time?"
d3a6sc,Nta- as long as you are doing the best you can within the time limit. But on a side note maybe this job is a trial because he wants to see if he can get you more involved with his business?
d3a7o0,"Seriously?  Yes. YTA.

Edit:  also lmao at ""ItS hUr PeRsOnaLiTy"" based on four pictures."
d3a9m3,"NTA. 

You're allowed to talk to more than one person."
d3a9qj,NTA. obviously living with your aunt and uncle is more comfortable for you than living with your parents. If they bring it up just tell them that you like having more space and less noise. And its not like you cut them out if you are still with them for the day.
d3aa4h,"NTA. If he wasn’t your dad, you’d have run a mile by now. I get that it is different with family, but he promised you something and isn’t giving it to you"
d3ab0l,Honestly NTA... If this is 100% true and nothing was behind it. They cannot expect to not attend the relevant meetings and still be cast in their preferred roles.
d3acit,"NTA

You don't have to spend every hour of free time with your girlfriend.  It's important to have time for your hobbies, and if those are hobbies best done in solitude then you're entitled to that alone time."
d3ackv,"Your NTA. Your romantic partner may not realize in full that your not giving away any part of your special plant and feels that if you are it diminishes the gift your giving them. That may be why they came off harsh. 

That harshness is uncalled for, even if you were giving everyone a piece of that special plant. That's what makes them definitely TA."
d3agp7,"NTA but obviously tell him directly
Can you read minds? Can he?"
d3ai0e,"You would be possibly beaten up and/or sued for the cost of removing the said sticker.

Horrible idea to deface someone's property, dont do this.

I understand the reasoning, thus I am not judging but YWBTA."
d3alil,"NTA. It's your cat, it sucks for her that she bonded with it but it's still your cat. Sounds like she was/is trying to manipulate you by buying litter/food and taking it to the vet without you even knowing about it. She can just get her own cat."
d3ap5q,NAH. Going on interviews is a good idea to keep yourself sharp. It’s always good to know what else is out there and you may be able to leverage a pay raise out of your current company if you’re offered a job. Keep applying and go on interviews!
d3aqhj,"Light YTA. Kids are cute, but she should be allowed to keep her own puck. Yeah, the kid might actually value it too and cherish the memory, but that doesn't mean your sister shouldn't be allowed to keep it. You put her in a super awkward place where she would have been an asshole for keeping it."
d3as97,"NTA - What the team does that you are no longer affiliated with is not your concern and you probably shouldn't even have the copy anymore tbh.

If she's screwed up and lost the files then that's her fault: regardless of her actions towards you, her mistakes are not your problem.

Another option is to just not reply..."
d3awdv,NTA....coworker was lazy and I would wager that there are many other inconsistencies caused by her/him if someone looked deeper.
d3axp9,"NAH. Everybody has a friend like this. They really don't want advice, they just want someone to listen and commiserate with them. While your friend deserves a friend that will listen to them, I don't think it makes you an asshole to tell her you simply don't want to offer her advice anymore on the matter."
d3axyy,"NTA

Any person that consistently talks bad about you behind your back is company you don't want. Let her be mad and find someone else to complain to, while simultaneously talking shit about said person"
d3b6y3,NAH you did what you were asked and the girl gets different housing
d3beyz,"YTA - Not a huge one, because you're under no real obligation to reciprocate, but it's still not a good look not to do so. I bet they could think of reasons why they wouldn't want to petsit for you either, but they did. You can't spare one weekend to keep an eye on the dog? There will be others."
d3blmi,"YTA

I can understand the bare hands thing, but I think you grossly overreacted. They're FRIES and you didn't even pay for them yourself. I can also understand how it could be frustrating how they took them AFTER you offered,  but c'mon man"
d3bnyl,NTA. You asked a question about doing a good deed. The school encouraged said good deeds without pressuring. These people have guilt coming from within and are blaming you.
d3bol2,"NTA

It's the designated smoking area. If the designated smoking area is in a bad place they need to move it. Not your responsibility. You're doing the right thing and being respectful by smoking where you're supposed to smoke. It's like asking someone not to pee in a toilet."
d3bonk,"NTA she is trying to guilt you into things and one of those idiots who think ""I attend church therefore I'm better than you"".

The act of attendance matters as much as it does in high school. At most it's 10% of your final grade"
d3bqtd,"NAH- you’re free to ask, he’s free to say no if he chooses too."
d3btjb,"NTA. He should've proffered a price before agreeing to do the work, you had no reason to suspect this something you would be paying for. That said, understand that previous work you did for employee have no bearing on the employee's BF behavior. This is a different situation, he could've charged, but he is an asshole for charging after the fact. If anything, all he is owed is your gratitude which is usually some form of muffin, liquor or other gift basket."
d3c51r,"NTA. This is your baby, not hers. She had her time when she had her child(ren). You do you."
d3c5sx,ESH but I support you. 14 year olds shouldn't be smoking.

d3c9jt,"NAH if something major happened. 

If he was being an idiot then it will be NTA for you. Though if you do find out what happened please let us know!!"
d3c9r3,NTA - this is beyond social norms -pretty clear this is well beyond just not liking someone - she seriously and permanently injured you by acting like an idiot and it’s totally understandable you have no interest in having her at your wedding. It sounds like your brother understands so that’s good although I think you should tell him yourself - don’t let him find out from an invite
d3cb84,Info - Was it Wednesday and he wasn't wearing pink?
d3chi8,"ESH.

* Grandparents for being assholes in how they demand yiu to teach them Russian
* You for not considering other possibilities of teaching them Russian (speaking it at home isnt the only way). Also the mentality you're portraying in this post (why dont they learn English) sounds assholish and selfish. 

Yiud do a service to your children if you make an effort to help them learn Russian. Not only would they be able to talk to their grandparents but also have a skillset thatd be extremely useful in the future. I've lost count to how many of my friends regret not learning their native tongue."
d3cih2,NTA but I would let his girlfriend know the truth about the situation so she can see what kind of guy he actually is
d3cizk,NTA - How would you be an asshole for helping your mom all you could and then she threatened you to live with your father and you actually did just like she said?
d3coqb,"NTA. Legally the new family probably has a claim to it, since your dad willed his half of the house to them. But that's something you'll need to talk to a lawyer about.

Morally, only the two sisters should keep the house. The new family has never stepped foot in it, and they should not get it now."
d3crbi,"NTA  
He's the one being selfish.  And the fact that he goes on this trip every year and you mention that you can't go on a solo trip away from your kids and husband tells me that this isn't the first time he's put himself ahead of you and your wants."
d3cslc,"YWBTA if you say nothing. You’re risking your roommate’s financial status to avoid a confrontation and it’s not cool. You’re essentially gonna spring the cost on him when the bills arrive. Tell him you expect to pay less rent to accommodate the live-in gf.

I agree you shouldn’t be paying for her, and your roommate is TA for not communicating anything to you, but don’t stoop to his level. Communicate."
