d3cst3,"This is a clear NTA. If the rooms aren't the same size, the rent shouldn't be split 50/50. If you can't pay more than half the rent, you get the smaller bedroom. 

You were either going to be subsidizing her larger room or constantly fighting her about why she can't have the room."
d3ctpv,"NTA. This should‚Äôve been discussed with before your mom decided something like this. Her guest, her responsibility to accommodate them."
d3ctvr,NTA. A last minute inability to attend an event after you‚Äôve already agreed to pay for a ticket doesn‚Äôt absolve you from owing the money you already agreed to spend.
d3cvl6,NTA.  Asking for signed contracts is EXACTLY what you should do!
d3cw5a,"NTA she clearly is oversensitive and you meant it as a joke. YTA though for starting your post by saying she doesn't pay any rent. This has nothing to do with it. If her parents are okay with it, who are you to judge?"
d3cxet,"NTA. You never agreed to this. It was a gift, he was wrong to assume this counted as his rent.

If he doesn't want it to be a gift, he can count it towards his cost of insurance."
d3d2mv,"YTA. I get that some guns look scary, but you're letting your assumptions override his knowledge.

You trying to lay down the law like this should be a huge red flag for him to reconsider getting married."
d3d3gn,"NTA, I actually think it's hilarious that you wiped it in front of them, teaches them a lesson for next time and might even get them to take a shower"
d3d9gw,"Yikes. Teenagers get pouty and such, sure. But, in this case it sounds like a lack of ‚Äúhome training‚Äù. They should not be justifying this shite behavior and letting it slide will not help anyone, least of all her, in life. NTA.

Edit because I see some folks commenting about you being the ass here: Holidays are and should be seen as a treat. I don‚Äôt think any misbehaved child or teen, biological or bonus, should have the right or expectation to go on them if they cannot behave appropriately."
d3d9t0,"NAH, between you and your mom if you do not go. She'll likely be disappointed in you, but she clearly has a different idea about what family means to her and who is in her family than you do. You have no obligation to try and work things out or make peace."
d3dbr9,"NTA

And if you are going to cut them out of your life, why even have them at the wedding? I disagree that there is no uninviting them. You can call, write, etc. and let them know what you've written here, and why you feel the way you feel. Your wedding should be a happy time, shared with those closest to you."
d3dcue,"ESH

The employee was overzealous and very very likely was bullshitting ‚ÄúThe I know you‚Äôve been stealing‚Äù. 

Your temper though was really short for doing something you knew very likely looks like stealing. The employee (who may or may not have experienced you doing this before, or even remembered you) was already in theft mode at that point and yea it was totally on you to be courteous and explain your situation without going over the edge."
d3dgfa,NTA he's married. And you said dating him while he's married would make you uncomfortable. Still nta
d3dggd,"Nta. It's unreasonable to expect something like that.


Since this means she'll most likely be alone, maybe you can suggest bringing a family friend that you both know? If that would be better in any way."
d3dj01,Sweet home Alabama üéµ
d3dj1f,"NTA based on OP's responses 

Sounds like she fired the first shots to embarrass you. It's bs that someone is calling you out for offering to fight fire with fire."
d3dj2k,"NTA As a girlfriend, I feel like we‚Äôre often expected to have our emotions catered to, but we‚Äôre not expected to reciprocate. You mentioned that you see her parents frequently, but not your own, and that you would be celebrating her birthday a different day. Your girlfriend needs to be more empathetic to your situation, you‚Äôre going through a hard time and need to see your mom. Your girlfriend is undoubtedly TA, especially for saying yes and then texting you. I make this mistake with my boyfriend but texting when angry is just bad."
d3dkng,"This is the whole problem with making a habit of 'joking around rudely' with friends. It's actually rude, and you never know what will cross the line into hurtful, which is why mature people don't do it.

YTA. You played a stupid game and you won a stupid prize."
d3dnqo,"YTA

They seem to have done a lot to help you develop your skills and even shown favoritism to you on work assignments. Leaving now is an asshole move, but if you're really unhappy, then just do it. You gotta do what's best for you....doesn't mean your not TA though unfortunately."
d3ds8v,"YWBTA. Mind your business it's not a big deal. Don't bring up rules that were on a PowerPoint, people won't like you for that."
d3dth4,NTA I think your going to be sick that evening
d3dtr9,"YTA if you phrase it that way. Don't act like you know how to control the classroom better than  she does.

Just talk to her after class and mention that the distractions are really interfering with your understanding of the material and ask if anything can be done, or if you can switch out."
d3dw4q,"NTA, I'd try to reschedule."
d3dwwa,"LOL NTA - his shitty relationship problems are not your fault. Ubers and taxis exist; he can pay for one of those. 

Bad friend, my ass. He's a selfish, manipulative baby."
d3dyry,"NTA - Say that you know that this is super uncomfortable for both of you, but you really like him as a room mate and you'd want someone to tell you if the tables were turned. Make sure it's just the 2 of you so he doesnt feel ganged up on. It may be a cleanliness issue or a health issue, don't assume."
d3e30r,NTA do what's healthy
d3e6gq,"NTA, sounds like she sucks."
d3ea4o,"YTA

There is no reason to nickel and dime when it comes to utilities, and you do look like a penny pincher. We are talking a total of $115 between 8 people. None of you would be paying enough to make such a big deal about it."
d3ece2,"Clearly NTA - If you two aren't close and she seems like she's going out of her way to exclude you, not attending the wedding will send a clear message. Plus it'll save you from having to spend on a bridesmaid dress.

But...you could also attend and watch a potential disaster unfolds...that's entertaining in its own right"
d3ed9o,"You sound very irresponsible with money. If you have been broke for a long time, and just finally got a check, the last thing you should be doing is buying clothes and splurging on everyone. You should be saving that money and getting your finances in order so you don't get yourself broke again. Your cousin should not be trying to milk you for what little money you have, though.

NTA"
d3edh5,"NTA. Not even remotely. 

>I ended up getting up, buying a pack of chips and tipping them $20 and thanked the two students


What a fucking power move. Nice job OP."
d3edky,"YTA. You are living there rent free.  You are an adult (you are 22), so act like one.  Offer to pay rent and then discuss conditions.  If you can't reach an agreement and you don't want to live by his rule, then move out, find and pay for your own place."
d3eebp,"Edited to change to NTA because I got more information

For pretending it is not weird to change the wall paper on your phone to another girl, friend or not, actually changing it at all to anyone while you two where fighting is of course going to make her feel bad. Was it honestly because of your friends birthday or was it because you were mad at her and didn't want to have the two of you on the phone? If it was the latter but you played like it was the former. YTA

Also you for bringing up having a civil conversation and then saying it wasn't the time. Did you really think saying that was going to not make her want to have the conversation right then?

Why do I get the feeling that you are using your therapist to double down on the gas lighting of her?

""YOU ARE UNWILLING TO MOVE ON, AND THAT‚ÄôS A REFLECTION OF YOUR CHARACTER.‚Äù  SO I am guessing the picture is of the friend who you are grieving? How long ago did she pass? Was she ONLY a friend or was there romantic interest?

She TA for screaming and throwing your phone. It sounds like JOINT counseling is what you need"
d3efoq,"YTA.

People are entitled to keep their past separate from their present. He's moved on from his addiction and is trying to establish himself in a new social setting without his past following him. This is withholding him from that and he's asked you non-aggressively to keep your child from interfering with his life. Would you want every new person you meet to know the worst things in your life before you've had the chance to show them who you are? It's not like he's been seeing this woman for years and lying to her, she's a new addition to his life and he's putting his best foot forward, which is understandable. 


Also the fact that he's an asshole in other ways has no bearing on this issue and makes you sound like you're making your decision based on the fact that you don't like him. That makes you look worse."
d3eg46,"NAH.  Perhaps find some gratitude that you don't suffer from what your sister does?  Also, it doesn't sound like you have any impairments so graduating from high school probably isn't a huge accomplishment for you.  For the clinically depressed, getting out of bed can be a huge accomplishment.

edit: missed a word."
d3egoo,NTA. Why on earth do people feel the need to bathe their fingers in saliva to turn a damn page?
d3eil0,NTA. You possibly did that dog a favor
d3ekym,"This might be a little controversial, but I‚Äôm going with YTA. You left an envelope, with the word ‚ÄúMONEY‚Äù on it, where anyone could see it. Of course it was going to be stolen."
d3enwh,"ESH

Lend him the book, you are being an asshole.

He is an asshole for not studying until the night before the test, and for ignoring you after he asked for something."
d3eo2x,"YTA

Why are you letting silly things upset you? He decided not to go, and that upset you. He asked you to pick him up a sandwich. That upset you. He said he would just get the sandwich when his roommate came back up, and that also upset you. The common thread is that none of this actually affected or harmed you in any way, yet you chose to be upset anyways. 

Tim is a big boy, and if he decides he is too tired to go out but still would like a sandwich thats his choice. You need to save your negative emotions for situations that matter. This does not."
d3es6u,"NTA for not wanting to spend time with someone who's always an ass.  You are, however, an asshole for expecting people to read a giant wall of text with no paragraphs and precious little in the way of punctuation."
d3esbt,"I'm currently studying to become a speech language pathologist and working with nonverbal children and AAC (what you describe your nephew using to communicate) is a major part of our job. That being said:

YTA. That ""fucking iPad"" is your nephew's VOICE. It's not some tablet where he was playing an annoying game; he was TALKING in the ONLY WAY he can right now. Taking it away is not only like physically taking away a verbal child's ability to talk, but also presented him with a negative experience when he was trying to communicate - the complete opposite of what his SLP hopes for him, I'm sure. What would you have done if he could communicate naturally with verbal language and just wouldn't stop talking? Would you physically stop him from talking? No? Then why do that to your nephew? Because that's exactly what you did to him. 

Also, that's not negative reinforcement. What you did was LITERALLY a punishment. You probably aren't really equipped to be caring for a child with autism, so if your sister somehow asks you to watch him again, please reconsider."
d3et74,"NTA - If the person who's supposed to be fixing things isn't, you should go over his head.

The problem is that you don't have a lease... Nothing that says who's responsible for what. So if the stepdad doesn't want to do anything about it, he really doesn't have to. And you don't pay rent so you can't withhold anything... Hopefully the stepdad is willing to take responsibility but you could be out of luck... I would leave.

Edit: I just realized you didn't say ""no rent"". So ignore what I said first, you have leverage! But still the problem of no lease saying who's responsible for what."
d3etnm,"ESH- him for making fun of your dead parent you for joking about the dog, just shitty situation...meh"
d3ex5q,NTA. It's a federal crime to knowingly open someone else's mail. Your neighbor sounds like the real asshole here.
d3exye,"I mean. . .I wouldn't lead with ""she's brainwashing the child"". But mentioning the recommended limitations on screen time to him and that you've noticed certain behaviors that could be related is fine. 

Also, just because your brother isn't staying home doesn't mean his wife is the only one responsible for parenting decisions. Weird that you're describing it as his wife's failing alone."
d3eyvj,Unpopular opinion apparently but NTA. He's being a douche about something that is important to you and won't hear you out about it.
d3f31n,"NTA, your boyfriend is accusing you of being with him when nothing happened, besides you blocked him so things should be fine."
d3f64y,"Hiding behind anxiety is bullshit. YTA if you ghost. 

You specifically told them your requirements. They agreed. Be an adult and tell them.

As a nurse, you're going to have to have much harder discussions with families. Consider this as another class."
d3f690,NTA - Exposure is the least they could do and they won't do it. They can fuck right off.
d3f6mo,"NAH.  At this age,  I would think your kid pretty much only cares about his friends being there (has your kid not reached the ‚Äúall the adults related to me are embarrassing‚Äù stage yet? If not, it‚Äôs coming.  Lol).   Just have a kids party with your nuclear family entertaining .  

And maybe have have a LOWKEY  cousins-family BD lunch or dinner one other day in the month for all 3 cousins"
d3f7dh,NTA.  Go to an Al-anon meeting pronto.  Addicts will drive their partners bonkers if the partners don't learn how to deal with the addict mindset.
d3f7gh,"NTA, this is your life and you have the right, and the agency, to decide how others are involved in it.

> I accepted and all of a sudden they whip out their iPhone to document their good deed so they could probably upload it onto Youtube to get views and many sponsorships. 

Oh holy shit I would be beyond *livid*"
d3f8qn,NTA. You're an adult and allowed to make decisions on what you do with your body. It's just hair.
d3fipj,NTA. You know your brother better than anyone here and know what finding out about this could do. Is there anyway you can contact the person who posted the video and ask for it to be removed?
d3fjri,NTA. You didn‚Äôt forcefully remove the dog from it‚Äôs yard or open the gate for it to get loose. This dog‚Äôs owners are fully responsible for him getting out.
d3fn33,"YTA but not for ratting them out, for not giving enough info for the prof to do anything.

I‚Äôm a college professor. If you told me who was cheating I could have looked at their finals and made a decision on whether to penalize them or not. 

If you are just vague ‚Äúsome people were cheating‚Äù how can I help? All you have done is made me feel shitty that I know some people got away with it."
d3fn3r,I'm sorry for your lost. NTA you have a life you need to get back to. You had to drop everything and take care of your dying mother. Your dad has no right to interfere with that.
d3fnd6,NAH. You guys both have your brothers best interests in mind but just have a different view of what that entails. I think I agree with your view but if you notice your brother do this again then perhaps it‚Äôs time to tell your mom. Everyone skips schools once... don‚Äôt let him make it a habit
d3fqwg,"NTA - People teach us how to treat them. He earned what he got. Unless there's a rule that says you have to give 5-6 to each customer, you do you.

Maybe you can eventually train him into being a less abrasive person by giving him more cookies when he's nice and fewer cookies when he's rude."
d3fyqk,YTA - you took out 115K in loans (which is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for college in the first place) to receive a low paying degree - and now you‚Äôre expecting your brother to bail you out.
d3fz5d,"NTA - if they insist on you paying, offer them the cost the airline would have charged you for the bags and nothing more."
d3g0pn,"NTA. Your girlfriend is very selfish and TA.

Red flag number one is that your girlfriend got mad at you because you couldn't be there to support her when YOU had just recently lost your mother. Why would she drill you because you were trying to cope and deal with your loss? 

Red flag number two is that she her calling you selfish because you're trying to understand a problem she's having so that you can help is idiotic. Then going on to say you have nothing to offer or give to her. 

It sounds like this unhealthy relationship has run its course and it's time to move on. Good luck OP."
d3g2sv,"Personally, I think you‚Äôre NTA, just because I‚Äôve been in a similar situation from the boyfriend‚Äôs side. Warning friends about the people they date is really the only way they get the outside perspective on them."
d3g3jc,"ESH ignoring him was petty, you could‚Äôve just explained that you were upset, but also he should apologise for treating you that way and understand if it hurt your feelings"
d3g3q8,NTA - just make sure you do it privately and gently. Think about how you would like someone to approach this issue with you
d3g7hq,"Nah kids always play up when there teacher is away. Someone has to be worst.  If it‚Äôs anything like my old school those kids are in for the bollocking of a lifetime tomorrow.

NTA tho"
d3g9mh,NAH - you‚Äôre allowed to do things without your sister. Your sister is a little bummed out and upset she can‚Äôt experience this with you. Try find some middle ground or plan a different concert or day out or whatever with her.
d3ga0l,"NTA if he‚Äôs making you uncomfortable chances are high that you‚Äôre not the only one who feels this way, be that coworkers or other customers."
d3gaf6,[deleted]
d3gh5c,"YWBTA. I'm actually infertile. It was not a choice. It has been and is a horrific struggle, followed by a great deal of grief--actual grief--for myself, my husband, and our families. My \*medical problems\* are not a cute hat for you to put on in order to get out of standing up for yourself and owning your life choices. You are childfree. Your friend is childfree. You are NOT infertile. Would you lie and say you had a different medical problem you don't have? If you wouldn't, don't borrow mine.

If I knew you and you told me you were infertile, I'd do everything I could to help you feel loved and perfect exactly as you are. The world is, frankly, pretty nasty to us. They mock us, feel superior to us. Blame us for our infertility. Act like if we just tried harder, we'd magically get pregnant. It's really freaking hard to--it's just hard. Every day. I'd do my damndest to make sure you knew I'd be there for you to listen and comfort you. If I found out afterward you were lying about the whole damn thing? I'd think you were a sociopath. Because I actually \*KNOW\* what you're lying about.

Lots of people are gonna call you NTA. I may be downvoted into oblivion. I don't always respond to these threads, because lots of times when I do, I get called ""barren bitch"" and shit on in DMs. Sometimes, i just don't have the strength. But the above is the God's honest truth. Why do so many people think it's A-OK to lie about a medical problem if it's infertility? You have made a positive choice in your life to live a certain way. Own it and be proud. You get to choose your fate. Be grateful."
d3ghyy,"NTA

Your reasoning makes perfect sense.  People coming in from out of town that you want to see is a valid reason to postpone, especially when it‚Äôs only by one day!"
d3gj28,"YTA

>I don't want to lie, but I feel like it's extremely prejudiced to require a bachelor's for entry-level work, especially when I know that I can do the job.

What you feel doesn't matter.  If you know that you can do the work then you need to demonstrate that creatively rather than trying it justify fraudulently lying about your lack of degree.  And do you think all the other candidates don't have similar work experience and a degree?"
d3gjsd,"ESH - The *only* reason you‚Äôre an asshole here is because you‚Äôre telling your boss they should have their hours *reduced* - what is that going to fix? It‚Äôs not going to fix a thing. You need to tell your boss the issues you‚Äôre describing to us - that they‚Äôre not working their 40 hours and everyone else is having to stay over to make up for their work, they aren‚Äôt good at collaborating, you‚Äôre doing work they should be doing, etc. So, other than what your plan is, you‚Äôre not an asshole for wanting to say something about it."
d3gkje,"YTA - but not a serious one. Every teacher considers their class to be important, so if a student basically says theirs was less important than  another, it's likely they wouldn't like that."
d3gmd8,NTA. Coffee is cheap as hell. Chances are you'll pay for the entire pot when you buy one cup
d3gmnc,NAH you don‚Äôt wanna go don‚Äôt go
d3grwd,"If you both agreed  that she should stay at home, you need to acknowledge that her role taking care of the family is just as important as your role as the breadwinner. If you have money set aside for your personal use, she should have an equal amount set aside for her personal use. Otherwise, you‚Äôre basically punishing her for a decision that the two of you made together, which would make YTA."
d3gtje,"YTA.

You purposefully exaggerated this. You even said in your comments she left a pad out *one time*. Wow, your wife forgot it this one time, when she's likely had to deal with this shit for every week for over a decade.

Grow up."
d3gvlg,NAH. I completely understand why you‚Äôd ask. See what the professor says.
d3gvph,"NTA, but neither are the other students. Fuck that teacher. The rules and sign up times are there for a reason. The teacher knows that, the students trying to get know that, and you knew that going in. It's not your fault that you did things the right way."
d3h0gi,NTA. You OWN the house. That is YOURS whether it's been in the family for hundreds of years or not. She has no right to demand that. It would be like my older sister demanding my bedroom in my house that I own. Tell her to kick rocks if she can't deal with that fact.
d3h2nm,"YTA - he‚Äôs with you, what‚Äôs the big deal if he‚Äôs talking to her, once for an extended period?  They were close friends, that‚Äôs always going to have been the case.  

If he was doing this all the time, and not engaging you emotionally or otherwise then sure maybe you have a reason to be upset, but based only on what you originally posted you are overreacting.

As my sister would say - take a chill pill.  Personally I would encourage you to be aware of this trigger, recognize it for what it is, and find a way to let it go.

This kind of behaviour is self fulfilling, if you obsess over nothing you will create a wedge between you.  This is total r/nicegirls material right here."
d3h3e2,"YTA

he gave you his answer, he couldn't afford to take the whole family. You tried to counter and find ways for him to come which is while nice, not appreciated. My perception of ""i'm working on it"" entails that he's **tried** all of these possibilities and already ruled them out. 

&#x200B;

Also the girls weekend, you have no idea how long they planned for this. This could've been planned out for 2 years and she slowly budgeted for it. I could entirely see as a plausible reason that she took off the days for this, and because of that she can't afford to miss work anymore, which is why he has to stay for the part-time job. Or if they had already spend the money for the girls trip, most likely they couldn't get it back."
d3h3wy,"NTA.  
But the police won't do anything. You need to call child welfare and adult protective services.  The police will just say that she has to legally evict them."
d3h5yo,"NTA, not even a little bit. 

He's a bully and you should have called him out earlier. 

I feel terrible for the other roommate who had to put up with the arsehat bully for so long."
d3h6zi,"YTA. You should've understood that your dad was getting distracted because of your conversation. It's not a good idea to talk with someone while someone's working. He didn't even freak out on you first, he did it only when you go up to him like ""hey Dad what's up"" as if you don't even know you've been disturbing him"

d3hawn,NTA. You're not even singing/rapping you're literally just playing the tune? That's insane that it would cause an issue. Unless the title has the N word in it or is otherwise offensive?
d3hb3n,"YTA - he is right. He asks them for help and they give it. He doesn't think they're obligated to help by the sounds of it. In fact it sounds like he knows they could easily say no or ignore his email. You would only have a case if he was harrassing them after they declined. 

And now he's also making professional relationships with people in the industry. It's really smart."
d3hm77,NTA. He spends almost all his free time with yall it seems. He needs to learn to be alone. Thats an important part of life too. Youre not always going to have people.
d3hrta,"Uh...what? I umm...I‚Äôm not sure how to go about this, but seeing as how your ex seems batshit crazy I would just take this opportunity to completely cut her out of your life and let what happens, happens. Move on. Not your responsibility.

d3hvpb,"NTA. Your dad made a commitment to you first and that's really all that matters here. You were accommodating when he cancelled the first time, but the second time was too much.

That said, you're lucky you have a father who is willing to do these things for you. I think you're being a little bit petty asking for an apology as if that's the only way he'd be invited to come spend time with you on your birthday."

d3i933,"NAH. He might have been able to book a later flight while at the airport then gone home, retrieved his passport, and made it to the destination late (and at a greater expense). You would have lost a few hours yourself, according to what you wrote, and he was the one that was not prepared."
d3ia58,"NTA - GOOD for you. It‚Äôs not like it is a surprise when school is not in session. If it is a family vacation, then they are TA‚Äôs for not including all the family"
d3iaop,Your GF is paranoid and probably has anxiety about it happening again and instead of coping with that she is obsessing with what you are doing. You deserve free time and should not have to update her all the time. She probably isn't aware that she is being controlling but she is. Her past relationships don't justify that behavior.
d3ing6,"NTA - this is a sleazy tactic used by debt collectors.  Make sure that you tell the debt collectors that they are under no circumstances to contact your address or any phone number associated with you again.  If they do, report them to the FTC and your state‚Äôs consumer protection agency.

At this age she could get herself into some very serious situations that someone of your age may not be able to handle. I commend you for looking out for your friend.

Your experiences and feelings are valid. Just because someone else may or may not have worse experiences does not mean someone is not allowed to FEEL BAD.

It's also not your sole burden to maintain relationships and/or force relatives to visit your son, and your mother is way out of line.  Is it safe to assume your parents are divorced so there's some extra tension for including his family over hers?  At any rate, have a great time at the party with people who actually care about your son.  (And please feel free to uninvite Grandma Crazy Pants!)"
d3jcn5,"NAH. You‚Äôre entitled to your feelings and nobody can tell you that you‚Äôre wrong for having them. That said, everyone has a past. Even if your boyfriend gets rid of those photos, that past still exists.

You can ask him to get rid of the pictures, but does it really change anything if he does?"

You essentially want to write two different stories and that won't end well. Also, you don't have to write stories with her. However, if lots of the worldbuilding was strongly influenced by her, I'd suggest changing that up, so you're not stealing her ideas.

The way you write it, it sounds like you came up with the overwhelming majority of points though, so if that's the case, I see no issue.

I'd also suggest you talk to her and explain why you don't think the partnership is working for you. If you're open about it, she'll probably be disappointed, but not feel betrayed. If you just write the book in secret, she might."

It sounds like you were just looking for something to hurt her with, and that definitely makes you TA."

d3m0gc,"ESH. It's wrong that he's cheating and he should definitely not be rewarded for it. I would probably report it if I saw someone do this, pisses me off to no end when people that copy work get rewarded more points than those that put genuine effort in. He should learn a lesson in plagiarism before it's too late.

 However, you don't seem to be reporting it for the sake of his education, you're reporting it because you don't like him. If you're looking for things he can get in trouble for purely because you resent him (which, judging by your post, is only because he's lazy - he hasn't done anything harmful to you personally), you're starting to slowly cross the asshole line. 

In this case I absolutely think it should be reported, but make sure to keep it reasonable. People won't hire lazy workers, but you won't last long in a job if you let your personal dislike of some of your coworkers get in the way either."
d3m2rt,YTA: Is looking at someone else's Instagram wrong? Bc in my opinion it's not. You got upset over something really petty and juvenile.
d3m6e9,"YTA for texting your ex if your current girlfriend is uncomfortable with it. You're not the asshole for replying in the first place, but and asshole for continuing to talk to her occasionally."
d3m6zz,"~~I N F O~~, I would say that the way you intend to deliver the message matters a lot.  If you do it in person, sit them down and hand them the letter, because you're not sure you'll be able to keep it together well enough to deliver it verbally instead, that's definitely N A H.  If you on the other hand leave for a month for a work trip and hide the letter under their pillow before you go, then turn off your phone for a month, that's more of a Y T A.

With more information at hand I think it's a NAH."

Being related isn't a free pass to take advantage of you, or treat you as a convenience. If they don't want to out the effort in for you, are they worth you putting the effort in for them? I mean, if they'll go to Greece for a friend, but not fly to see you, that's rather worrying."

d3mujw,"NTA

Block her and move on."
d3mxjs,"ESH. Your SO obviously sucks for playing the victim even it's her who's been taking up more of your time than you want to give, but you're also TA for not wanting to talk with her.

She's not calling to tell you things. She's calling to have a conversation and feel close to you, and sure she may go off topic but she's probably trying to stretch it out to spend more time with you, but you seem like you'd prefer if she only called you after writing an itemised list of bullet points so she can just rattle off her list of facts and let you go to sleep.

Most people won't be okay with only seeing their SOs once every 2 weeks, and I get that you're stressed, but trying to limit contact with someone who's already not getting as much time with you as they want isn't a good way to maintain a relationship.

You also went about it the wrong way. Stating at the beginning of your conversation that you don't have a lot of time before you have to go to bed would be a lot less hurtful than asking her to hurry up while she's talking but would accomplish the same thing."
d3mzcd,"NTA. She caused all this. If I was having a child left for me to look after with no warning or care for any plans I had, I'd be quite annoyed too, especially if they didn't even offer to reimburse me. 
Then she starts acting aggressive trying to strong arm you into taking the child so she can do her thing. Also wants to psychologically manipulate and guilt trip you over unrelated things. 
And finally, to top that off, appears to want YOU to apologise, when it should be her."
d3n42s,"NTA. If a friendship is no longer working out then you can both try to fix things (solve the conflict like you said). However, if you no longer feel like it is worth the effort since they have become toxic then you shouldn't feel guilty over ending things."
d3nmls,"YTA you set your boundaries with her which is fine but the whole ""do you really love your boyfriend"" right after she confided in you is asshole behavior."
d3nnce,"ESH - but mostly your friend. To avoid being the asshole may I recommend a succinct message explaining why you no longer want to be her friend (after so many years full-on ghosting feels mean). 
If you don‚Äôt want to have to read a nasty reply from her, block her number as soon as you‚Äôve sent it - but at least she will know exactly why you‚Äôre no longer friends - I wish former friends had at least done this for me so i knew to either defend myself or grow from the experience. Not knowing is particularly upsetting."
d3noky,"NTA. And this has nothing to do with being Aspie. Their behavior is totally out of line, and it's ridiculous that they're expecting you to be a referee to their own personal dramas and pick the winner...regardless of whether you're on the spectrum or NT. Can you just ask them to please leave you out of their drama?"
d3npcd,YTA. You sound a little entitled.
d3nrzm,"NTA: 50 years ago, company loyalty meant something because you could depend on that job your whole life.

Today, companies find it cheaper to use contract labor to avoid pesky things like employee benefits and the like.

Basically, if they had wanted you, they should have put a ring on it. They shouldn‚Äôt have put all their eggs in a basket that had no incentive to stay."
d3nzgv, ESH.  This was a conversation you should have had with the parents and not with a teenager.
d3o153,"NTA.  You have a prior commitment, so declining the parents invitation is the right thing to do.  Is it possible your sister doesn‚Äôt really want to have dinner with them either, and wanted to have you around with her so it wasn‚Äôt just her plus a bunch of your parents‚Äô friends?"
d3o69f,"Reluctantly, YTA. Based on your husband‚Äôs comment about your tone, you likely sounded kind of judgmental and know-it-all. 

In the future, you could ask clarifying questions instead of making statements: ‚ÄúHow is she feeling about the 12 hour shifts? That must have been intense to help with the IV; what part did she do?‚Äù"
d3odcd,"NTA. You didn't exactly send something terrible, versus her sending something that could potentially screw up things royally with your pc. Not comparable and a good comeuppance. She probably only blocked you because you weren't an easy target anymore.  

As for your friend? She needs to get off her high horse."
d3odhd,"ESH - you get one seat.  Not one seat, plus the gap in front, plus part of her area.  She should keep her paws to herself."
d3oged,"NTA - personally I would go with the best combination of price and quality. It seems like there would be some differences between firms. I wouldn‚Äôt award him the business or eliminate him based on your past. Do what is right for your current company. If that means giving this guy a contract, so be it. He wasn‚Äôt trying to screw your before, he was likely trying to protect himself. People do crazy things for self preservation in a sinking ship."

d3otiy,"You work in the food industry and ordered a full meal 15 minutes before the kitchen closed. YTA, you know that. They had to wait for your dishes to go home. You kept them there later than they probably would have been otherwise. Sweeping with customers in the restaurant is a clear signal you need to go."
d3ox4n,">I even tried hinting that I'm taken after coming back from vacation by saying, ""*we* visited, traveled etc."" but apparently, she didn't take the hint.

""We"" is an extremely weak hint. That could just be anybody. Next time, you should say ""my boyfriend and I"" or ""my partner and I"". 

I'm gonna go with NAH. She's really unprofessional with her interaction with you, but she's not mean or hostile towards you. It was also abit irresponsible for you to talk to your boss, who supervises all of you. That's outside of your boss's responsibility, you need to deal with something like that. I suggest dropping stronger hint until she stops. If she doesn't stop after knowing that you're gay and already have a partner, you need to confront her to stop. Hope that helps"

d3pfhy,"NAH - I understand where everyone is coming from. You're both adults, and basically in a rental situation. Obviously your mom cares, but if your brother was renting somewhere else his whereabouts wouldn't be under such scrutiny.

d3phax,"YTA - Firstly, I think offering homeless people food instead of money is fine, but on the condition that they have to eat with you strikes me as...very weird and a little manipulative/predatory. Instead of just doing a nice act and buying someone a sandwich, you're requiring them to spend time with a perfect stranger. Homeless people are human beings, and this is just odd. I also don't think you should offer to buy someone a meal and allow them to order what they want unless you're prepared and capable to pay for whatever they want."

Okay you could have been polite and said that you are sure she is super thrilled but honestly, not interested. But it doesn't seem she got the subtle messages either."
d3plok,"NAH. I think your approach is reasonable here. The older boy will probably find someone closer to his age to date soon enough.

>First off, I don't think our son should even be dating at 12

That is a normal sentiment. If you would have had it regardless of the child's sexuality, there's no reason to throw it out. Plenty of parents say no dating until 14, or 15, or whatever.

Yes it is."

d3pvud,NTA. A little something for you to try that is easier than always keeping the door shut: one of my cats also suddenly picked up the habit of pooping in the bathtub. I started plugging the drain and filling it with just a half inch of water when it wasn‚Äôt being used. A few times of him jumping into the water and he got the message. Now I don‚Äôt have to keep water in there and he stopped using it as a litter box alternative.
d3pwff,"NTA. We are special needs parents. When our kiddo went through an aggressive stage at 5/6, we kept her home and away from other kids until we had worked through our therapy plan to modify that behavior. She is now 10, patient, kind and possesses the necessary skills to control her behavior and enjoy traveling, visiting friends, etc.

Being special needs does not give a child the right to destroy property or cause injuries. At 12, he should have had enough ABA therapy to identify his triggers, teach de-escalation techniques to his caregivers, help him develop his own coping mechanisms and/or include a medication, if necessary, to blunt those violent outbursts. IMO they are doing their son no favors expecting the world to cater to him. Long-term, he will likely end up in a residential setting for his own safety."

edit 2 (and last, tired of this nonsense): One final question for the people disagreeing here: Why is it OP's fault if the guy didn't make his intentions clear? Why is it ""naive"" to take someone at face value? If he wanted to ask her out, and if anyone wants to ask anyone out, they should state clearly that they have the expectation of it being a date. It's not OP's fault if this guy *is* trying to ask her out and she didn't realize. If you want to take someone out romantically, say that. Don't expect other people to be mind readers and then be pissed off when they read wrong."

You don't have any other classes that day so now you have to commute all the way back home (sice you obviously don't have the money to live on campus, I mean have you seen dorm costs?) and for all your efforts today you've gotten 0 info to help you pass this class and $23.16 from working the morning shift, which is practically what you spent in gas anyways.

You had a crush on a guy for *years*, as an alleged adult, told all your friends, but did you ever, oh I don't know, make any attempt to let *him* know you were interested? This is how children behave. 

Frankly, F (and M) is much better off without you in her life, and the rest of your mutual friends that ditched her because of your antics,too. It sounds like there was exactly 1 decent person in the crowd, and y'all have shut her out of it."

d3ws3v,"YTA. This is not your childhood home. This is a house that your father and Linda picked out and purchased together as a couple.

That being said, it might be worth it to clearly spell out your boundaries/issues first before taking that step. 

Maybe something like ""I understand that you care about me but when you do (insert behaviors here), I don't appreciate it and it comes across to me like you think it's okay to judge and criticize me over and over. It makes me feel uncomfortable around you.""

If he pushes back and refuses to change, then you can simply say something along the lines of ""I'm sorry you feel that way. I'd prefer that we not spend time together anymore, then.""

Some people don't have a good understanding of boundaries but can respond well/learn to behave better when things are laid out calmly but clearly. It's usually worth at least giving them a chance and it's honestly good practice clearly communicating your own boundaries either way."
d3xn2b,"NTA - you may both be parent partners forever, but that doesn't mean you're married (combined into one unit of shared finances).  I'm 100% in agreement it can be best (not always, but often) for mum to stay with baby for a year - if she wishes to.  However, if you're intending to stay separate - two homes, two mortgages, etc. - then no, you're not obligated to pay all her expenses for a year and that doesn't mean you don't have the child's best interests at heart, it means that you are mature enough to know that you have to manage your finances properly, or said child will be lacking in many things later on."
d3xne1,"NTA. My dad traveled for work back when it was a long distance call you had to pay for it, and he never missed a call to me or any of my 5 siblings. It would've broken my heart if he missed enough calls that I found it normal and not an accident."

I do think that storming out an making a scene was a little over the top. It puts you in an awkward place where now you have to talk with her about watching your sister AND how you stormed out. If you had just talked to her and let her know you were furious and that she was out of line you would have avoided the whole storming out scene.

The female dress code, although you believe it to be more lax, is also far more detailed in what it restricts than the men‚Äôs. It also doesn‚Äôt take into account the difference between men and women‚Äôs fashion and bodies. For example most men out there can buy a reasonably priced business suit that fits them- the exception being extremes in height and weight, who may have to pay extra. I have worked in professional environments for 12yrs, including in politics and banking, and I don‚Äôt have one dress in my wardrobe that would fit your dress code. Not one. Because women‚Äôs business clothes are not designed to those specifications. Women‚Äôs suits are few and far between (and notoriously difficult to fit on curvier bodies), professional dresses tend to finish just at or above the knee for movements sake (below the knee in pencil shaped skirts restricts how you walk unless you put in a slit- and slits end up either showing a lot of side thigh or with women with a booty- the back slits can become dangerously high), the most common work dress is a simple wrap dress, but that shows cleavage, and even if a dress is all the way up to the neck, large boobs often distort the shape of the dress, and often breasts look more prominent in a high neck dress/shirt, than a v, but anything with even a slight scoop can cause issues with cleavage. 

So basically, you see the dress code as reasonable, but it‚Äôs actually really hard to find professional dresses to fit into it. The dresses I have that would fit into it are all loose casual dresses, which I would never in a thousand years wear at work, but my wardrobe which has been valid in the halls of parliament would not fit your dress code. 

Also rapidly changing the dress code means your employees need to buy an entirely new wardrobe instead of what they‚Äôve been wearing to work for however many years with no problem. Not everyone has that money.

A good management move would be to gather a focus group of employees, of both genders to redo the dress code to something that the employees and you are comfortable with, and set a date in a few months time when it will start being enforced so they have time to rearrange their wardrobe."

The only thing I could add in the interest of considering both sides is that when you realized you were going to be drinking and knew you didn't want to get an Uber, it might have been more considerate  to let him know you'd like a ride later so he could be prepared, rather than letting him know *as* you needed it.

I think it was a moment of poor judgement on your part. I think it's reasonable she's upset, as it was hers and a part of a bigger plan she had with her friends, but I'd say if you've apologised to her and (if she asks) to the new Mum, and she's still bringing it up 4 months from now, it could start to become unreasonable."

You share things on FB as a public gesture. If you really just thought they'd give him a laugh, you can screenshot things and text them. FB tags are meant to display your p2p communication to everyone, so there's an element of parading around your relationship in front of other people.

d48mwq,YTA. And how you can say a good Christian sticks with the facts is hypocrisy at its finest.
d48nsu,"NTA.  It is rude to drop by unexpectedly.  The fact that she's framing this as doing you a favor that you ought to be grateful for is also very offputting.  And I think that if someone said that to me while dropping off food, I'd be pretty miffed.  She's implying that no thought or care goes into the meals you have at your house?  That's a pretty solid burn.  

So yeah, tell them both off.  They need a reality check."
d48oz0,"NTA, she has been ignoring your messages relating to the wedding and has not expressed any interest to you.

She is now playing the victim."
d48r4e,NTA. I don‚Äôt ever tip for take-out.
d48rcq,"NTA -  This sounds like a huge amount of backbreaking work. You agreed to help the stepmom, but now find out she's not actually doing any of the work? And she's not paying for all the materials? So it's not helping her with the garden, it's just doing it for her. This is taking advantage of you.

Saying that, even though you're in the right, you live with these people so it's important to find a diplomatic solution. It would seem fairer if the stepmom also helps with the work and pays for all materials."
d48sp2,"NTA. 

You have done more than your part, your ""friend"" needs to own up and do his part. 

But make sure to have evidence to protect yourself in a worst case scenario where your ""friend"" starts to blame you for not being ""helpful""."
d48vhk,"NTA - first off, your mom is WAY out of line to offer your services to anyone without asking you first.  Second, you're not a taxi service - taxis, public transport and uber exist for that. Third, you're absolutely right - not your kid, not your problem. You were smart to be firm on this because if you said yes this one time, it'll become a hundred times you're asked."
d48whd,"NTA

It sounds like your husband thought he had a really good idea for a fun family outing but then they were closed. He should have planned better but I have also been in the unenviable position of telling my daughter we were going to do something fun, having it fall through, and then trying to find an alternative activity. It sounds like you likely acted annoyed which made him defensive. If this happens all the time, I‚Äôm with you. But otherwise...mistakes happen. I think you could have handled it better but the fault mostly lies with him for not checking the opening times.

I just don‚Äôt understand why he wouldn‚Äôt get you a water from the gas station. Soda is about the same in terms of cost.

What really pushes him into asshole territory is his refusal to take you by your childhood home and his cruel comments about not being interested in it. There was no need for him to be so callous about something important to you."
d48zq5,"I think the real question you need to be asking is, why does your 22 y/o bf have 2 deceased exes?"
d4954e,NTA please cut her out of her life
d496iw,Are those things as interesting/fun as Yosemite?
d497ld,"Learning Santa wasn‚Äôt real when I got older, figuring it out by myself wasn‚Äôt a traumatic moment, nor did I give a shit my parents lied lol 

It was fun and I have fond memories of it and I actually enjoy looking back the effort my parents put in to the while Santa thing. It wasn‚Äôt a religious thing it was just fun times , I think you should just let him have his imagination , enjoy the Christmas crap in elementary school and not be the odd kid out but that‚Äôs just me!"
d49cts,NTA.  She's just being a user.  You don't owe her your account.
d49eet,"NTA at all

> said I might be ruining this kid‚Äôs chances of getting into a good college.

Sounds like he did this, not you. If other teachers have already turned him down, that speaks VOLUMES about him, really."
d49g5g,"NTA, you let her have the room she wanted, and now she comes back to cry and complain?

Sounds like your parents are trying to reason with you so they don't have to deal with your sister's fits. How about you tell them that if they think sharing space is so important, they share *their* room with your sister? I'm assuming the master bedroom will be the largest one in the house, after all."
d49hpf,YTA simply put you can‚Äôt force someone to pay something for your benefit you and your fianc√© are both adults knocking on the door to 30. If his dad doesn‚Äôt want to pay neither of you have the right to attempt to force him to pay.
d49pwi,ESH.  Dumping cold water on someone in the shower is a prank.  This stuff is just messed up.
d49q04,"NTA.  People are telling him what he wants to hear, but the reality is that she may never want to have children."

d49qtp,"NAH, I still think ¬£20 is generous to be honest!"
d49s40,"NTA with some qualifications. 

I'm not a fan of people touching me at all without consent but an arm touch is different to someone purposely brushing your ass. 

I'd punch someone for touching my ass, but I wouldn't if they touched my arm. I'd just say ""don't touch me, thanks."""
d49sao,"NTA 

You didn't make up a story or try to make her look bad. A normal person would have laughed with you at your joke."
d49tmy,NAH but go to couples therapy to sort it out.
d49v2r,"YTA - If you feel you‚Äôre doing the majority of the work, you need to bring that up in a separate meeting. As Vice President, you should have some form of decision making, so you need to *require* that certain people help with these events. 

Anyway, in-person meetings *are* more efficient. I understand you‚Äôre burned out - I helped run a huge event at work recently and I was INCREDIBLY burnt out by the end of it. So I get being exhausted, but this *is* your duty. You‚Äôre one of the leaders in this fraternity, and despite you not helping with the decisions, I‚Äôm sure the Vice President being there for these meetings is a necessary thing."
d49yqq,NTA. It‚Äôs illegal for you to work off the clock. Don‚Äôt mind the entitled people.
d4a0ks,"NTA- if you had said you want him to ditch the kid for your bday I would have said you‚Äôre an asshole, but celebrating on a day when you can do something together is reasonable

I would suggest wording it in away that takes away from wanting not have the kid there because you don‚Äôt always enjoy his attitude. Instead saying something like ‚Äúso we can spend the day alone together, or do something for adults‚Äù."
d4a4kj,"NTA.

No man should talk badly about the mother of his children to his fucking children. I understand that this would be a very stressful situation and conversation to have but you are more than right to tell you dad to cut it out."
d4a8k1,"lol NTA, you warned them you might not be able to pick them up. You let them know when you could confirm for sure and when they checked in with you, and it's not really that difficult to find a way to go home from the airport imo... they already knew they couldn't rely on you for sure after all!"
d4a9sr,NTA - Wake up sugar mama!
d4ab2o,NAH. I agree with your husband that you shouldn‚Äôt expect help from your guests. You‚Äôre also entitled to not have dinner parties if you don‚Äôt want to clean up after everyone.
d4ab9h,No they need help. Get out as fast as you can.
d4abve,NTA.  But it would have been generous of you to jump in anyway.
d4ae7x,"NTA - But would suggest ""grey rocking"" her instead of fully cutting her out so you can remain in contact with your nephews."
d4aeep,"NTA. She wastes your time, you waste hers. Seems fair to me."
d4am6l,"NTA You're a child, your dad is the adult. ""Sports"" parents are another form of ""stage"" parents and typically waaaay to invested in living vicariously thru there kids. I know it hurts but you'll probably be a lot less stressed if your dad stops coming."
d4am8x,"NTA. You had plans, he didn't respect your time."
d4amuu,"YTA for not taking better care of yourself if you know this happens frequently. Also, you can‚Äôt expect other people to ignore what looks like a medical emergency, and to follow your wishes when you are clearly incapacitated."
d4an48,"NTA. Your mom should be teaching you to have more empathy. It‚Äôs unfair for her to expect that level of emotional care from you when she does not offer it in return. That being said, she is your mother and at your age I‚Äôm sure there is plenty she does for you that may just go unnoticed. You should open up to your mom about your feelings, and explain that while you know there is a lot that she does for you, you want to feel more supported emotionally and have your feelings taken seriously."
d4asg5,Nta. A needs to stop being lazy and actually parent her child instead of leaving the parenting to the iPad
d4axr3,NAH.  Only you can decide what has pushed past what you are willing to give.  In a lot of ways I'm guessing the dad is an asshole but their situation sounds so messed up I can't muster up the outrage to judge.
d4aypm,NTA. Why the hell is he asking a random barista for help with his phone? Sounds like a boomer
d4b3jz,NTA. I hate Target bathrooms so much.
d4b3tv,"NTA

She created the awkward situation by putting you in the position to follow up so much since she wasn't following through.

You asked for money that's yours and then she does this insanely petty thing and stops talking? Give me a break. Sounds like a friend not worth having. I'm not saying cut her off, but certainly don't feel bad, and don't apologize for her bad behavior."
d4baf1,"NTA. Your dad never bothered to sign your birth certificate, caused you self-esteem problems, cheated on your mom, and now lives with his affair partner. There is nothing wrong, and nothing to feel guilty about for not wanting to see him."
d4bcsi,[deleted]
d4bgcl,NTA. Sounds like a genuine question to me: if she can‚Äôt answer then maybe she can have a think about it and an honest discussion could come out if it.
d4bgxg,NTA but maybe you need to take a step back? It sounds like you are way more invested than he is. If he is not willing to maintain a friendship sober then why should you?
d4bkfj,NTA. There's a huge double standard with sex toys. Have fun with it. There's no reason for you to limit yourself if you need it. You aren't cheating or going behind her back even as you were honest that you bought it.
d4bvo5,"NTA. Two hours a day? That's 14 hours of cleaning a week by just you.  That's utterly ridiculous. Are the other five people cleaning two hours a day? It sounds like your housemate thinks you should do all the cleaning just because it's your occupation.

As long as you take care of your own spaces and pick up after yourself in common spaces, I don't see the issue. With common spaces, maybe your house can have a designated cleaning day at regular intervals, whatever is necessary for upkeep, where everyone commits to certain tasks. That way the work is still apportioned evenly."
d4bwbm,"ESH. You blamed a 19 year old when it CLEARLY takes two to tango, but to be fair it does take two to tango and she knew your soon-to-be wasband was married."

d4c3a4,"NAH 

Your parents have been planning this for years, it might be an inconvenience now, but getting that car from the estate after he passes would be a whole issue. 

Seriously.  *A whole issue.*

Right now your wife is super focused on the baby, and your daughter in law, so everything else is irrelevant to her, and she's correct in her focus. 

I'm not understanding how this vehicle is an issue at all though, park it in the yard, bungee cord a tarp over it, deal with it when things get under control."
d4c8dj,"NTA. Anyone who says, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love me because you do/don‚Äôt do this thing‚Äù is wrong and manipulative."
d4chmm,"NTA Besides he could be a crazy guy with a gun, you have no idea what‚Äôs going on in someone‚Äôs life to make them in that kind of hurry. Maybe their kid got in an accident and they are rushing to meet them at the hospital or maybe they are about to hav explosive diarrhea and trying to get to a toilet. She has no empathy or understanding and was literally being an ass for what? One car that was going to cut her?"
d4cmyy,"Hard to judge without knowing what was written, but I‚Äôm going to go with ESH. 

Yeah bullying sucks, but what‚Äôs the point of dragging up something that happened years ago? Why focus so hard on something that happened years ago?"
d4cnvx,"NTA. Your page, your posts. And as far as respect goes it doesn't seem very respectful not to come to you with problems about what you post. Running to your mom doesn't show a lot of respect to you as an adult."
d4coah,"ESH 

They are rude to constantly comment on something you can‚Äôt help but fetishes aren‚Äôt exactly something most people talk about publicly and even if it was a joke it‚Äôd be more appropriate with friends than parents."
d4crdv,"NTA
You should definitely go see your family if that's what you want to do"
d4cwif,"NTA. I find the part about eating a big meal with the kids really weird. Like you cook a big meal, he doesn't do a thing, and yet he takes half the food while you and your two kids share the rest? It seems so selfish and disrespectful to me. As for the rest, it must be very annoying to be the only one cooking, and if it doesn't work for you tell him and stop doing it."
d4cxol,"NTA.  I see two possibilities here: #1, he's depressed about you leaving, doesn't know how to handle it, and is diving in to other things to avoid thinking about it.  If that's the case, he needs to face it so he doesn't regret not spending time with you after you go to boot.   #2, he's an asshole.  

Either way, it is entirely normal and reasonable to want to spend time with someone before you leave for a long period of time. You are responding like a normal human being."
d4cyb0,NTA. I am religious - though no godparents for me. And I actually think you were respectful with your reasoning. Maybe your family just wanted to have you be a part of this thing that was important to them. But no one should be forced to participate in religious ceremonies/rites they don't believe in.
d4d6ie,"YTA for not even making an attempt.
You assumed they would say no to your GF coming ( not just 2 other friends like the first time ) and also for already assuming what your GFs reaction to you explaining it to her is going to be.
If you had asked your friend if she could come, and they said no, then told your gf what happened, then there would be NAH."
d4d7ds," NTA. What kind of monster says such things to a three year old? If she had a problem with it, she should speak to you, not be mean to a toddler."
d4dbkp,Your parents are very bad at hiding. And it seems like you both could use some professional help of screens are interfering with your wellbeing.
d4dbrf,NTA. I wouldn't want to go in that situation either.
d4dc2o,"NTA. There is a reason that P has no friends. You're not obligated to be his friend, and nothing is worse than a wannabe DJ."
d4der0,"NTA. She shouldn't be like that at all, I know I would get incredibly annoyed.

Be warned though, if you do tell her you don't want kids the shit is gonna hit the fan and it may make her even worse moving forward."

You should have known conversations wouldn‚Äôt be private when it‚Äôs on your mother‚Äôs phone"
d4dgi5,INFO - Why do you think that you are not committing fraud?
d4dhei,"So they decide based off of one shirt that you aren‚Äôt a good fit?

I‚Äôd tell your girlfriend that you did want to make a good impression, but that you had no idea you‚Äôd be meeting them this soon.

And tell her that you feel it‚Äôs unfair to say you‚Äôre not a good match based off of a dumb shirt. Are you sure it‚Äôs just the shirt?"
d4dmdq,"YwbTA if you texted her that, so please don't. 

NAH though. Maybe make some extra effort cleaning your place up, fresh sheets, scrubbed bathroom. Vacuum, that sort of thing. Plan a nice night out. Or in for Friday.

Maybe she'll realize it's nice to stay in town. Bring your issue up to her face to face, don't do that over text."
d4dn32,[deleted]
d4dy95,"INFO: What was the joke you made?

I'm leaning towards ESH because I think there's probably a reason you're not being more explicit about how offensive the joke was (that reason being that it paints you in a bad light and was a deserved reason to be sent out of class). Obviously he's a dick for treating kids differently based on personal preference and generally sounds like a bad educator, but I think you should probably let this go for your own peace of mind. He's a high school teacher, it's not like you're helping kids avoid taking his class because they don't get to choose who they have for history, and I highly doubt he'll face any consequences because of a decade-old anecdote on a rating site, so basically you just want to put this guy on blast because you're still pissed off. Let it go, it's only bound to make you look (and probably feel) petty."
d4dzkk,"NTA - It sounds like you were laughing because what the mom said was ridiculous. After I read the headline, I honestly thought this would be a story where you had insulted the mom because you‚Äôd laughed at her wanting you back, and you supported the new girlfriend by treating it as a joke. It sounds like she‚Äôd been looking for an excuse demand you be cut off and grabbed this pretext. 

You and your ex might know in your hearts that you‚Äôre never ever getting back together, that there is nothing but friendship. But it sounds like his mom still hopes, and it will probably be hard to convince every SO either of you ever has that you‚Äôre just friends.  You need to weigh the balance of the friendship with the potential harm it will do to your relationships.  

A very long time ago I had a kinda similar situation. I dated a guy for a while, we were majorly incompatible, and broke up. Somehow we found our way back to being friends, but every single person either of us dated had fits about it. One of his girlfriends forbid him to see me, and to make peace he agreed, and then snuck around for us to have lunch.  It was a weird situation being the ‚Äúother woman‚Äù when I totally wasn‚Äôt. But I thought she was a controlling bitch, and I wanted to see my friend.  (Also, not dating, not cheating, we‚Äôd occasionally have lunch in a restaurant.). Eventually, we each found our long-term partners, and that‚Äôs where things came to a head.  My husband likes the guy I dated for a couple of months 25 years ago, and has never had a single ounce of insecurity. My husband is an amazingly non-jealous person.  But my friend‚Äôs wife gave him an ultimatum after they were married:  me or her.  I think she‚Äôs a lovely person.  She‚Äôs smart, creative, and really gets my friend in a way I never could.  They‚Äôre great together and I‚Äôm happy for them.  I honestly don‚Äôt blame him for choosing his wife.  That‚Äôs what you do when you get married:  you put your spouse first."
d4e3jx,"NTA - 
I‚Äôd want to know if the guy I was seeing was saying shit like this.
I‚Äôd be grateful if someone told me."
d4e5k6,"Hm I‚Äôm gonna go with NAH.

As someone who played a shit ton of Overwatch, losing over and over gets tiring/frustrating, even if it‚Äôs just in a casual situation like you playing with friends. I also understand the feeling of being significantly better than your friends (I hit master while most of my friends were silver/gold).

You‚Äôre not an asshole for being good at the game, and they aren‚Äôt assholes for getting tired of losing. You probably could have been more considerate and dropped out, but they also need to learn it is just that, a game."
d4e8x7,"NTA. It's your apartment, you're allowed to smoke in there. If you were standing at their door smoking sure I understand them asking you to move along, but seriously fuck that. 

I would also be putting in a complaint about the security officer. It's not his place to help them find you to complain"
d4e9ax,NTA.  It shouldn't be any different than renting from someone else.  Pay or find a new place.
d4ebfn,"NTA. 

You should tell him. Better he hears from someone kind like you, then to hear it secondhand or from someone far crueler. He could‚Äôve potentially not even noticed and you would be doing him a favour."
d4ebxd,"NTA. She has a part time job. And you are under no obligation to pay for her park ticket, you are already being generous offering to pay her travel. 

The park ticket is something your parents can perhaps pitch in?  

Though, a 17 year old traveling with 21 year olds (I assume your friends are the same age?) might limit what you guys can do."
d4ech5,"Stay out of it! YWBTA your aunt and uncle need to get on the same page and deal with it

Edit to add: I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôd be the asshole strictly for doing what your family asks but this really isn‚Äôt your responsibility and will only make things bad with you and your cousin."
d4ecoh,"NTA. It sounds like the man was being rude to you, and you were ready and willing g to get up if need be. 

Were there any more open seats, or was that literally the only seat open in the priority section?"
d4ecw6,"NTA - It's the manager's responsibility to schedule correctly and it's also the manager's fault for not creating a ""team"" environment where people want to do their best. If you're not required to work overtime and you don't want to, there's no point in second guessing yourself - go enjoy your time off."
d4egjv,"ESH. Your 13 year old sister should not be dictating when she drinks. She needs therapy, possibly both individual and family therapy with your aunt and yourself. 

 Please stop the drinking and smoking habits right now. My family has experienced this situation, and it's not a bright future ahead of her. When my grandma died she had several child between the ages of 10-18, my grandpa died 10 year earlier.  One of those children was a 12 year old son, who was raised by an aunt and uncle after she died. My uncle did not handle her death well, and began smoking and drinking around the age of 12 and the last 50 years has been difficult for him. His life has been filled with bad relationships, including a 15 year verbally-abusive one. He's an alcoholic who got a DUI and thus loss his driving-based job and his license. He's not motivated to do anything, including getting his license back 5 years after he's been eligible to do so.  He doesn't care about his health and hygiene, and frankly my family has given up on him until he wants to take care of himself. Please do not give up on you sister. Talk to her doctor and school, she's a child who has gone through something traumatic and needs to learn proper coping skills. Check out mentorship programs for her, team sports, or something, she needs an outlet and guidance for her grief before it's too late."
d4ej4w,"NTA. Your spoon didn't even TOUCH the meat. He's just being extra. It's only a problem when the veggie food has touched meat itself.

\-girl with hindu parents"
d4emxr,"YTA. B coming to you for advice for the dream proposal is a good thing that shouldn't be discouraged. It shows she cares enough about what makes A happy that she's willing to research and ask questions. It's the romantic equivalent of asking for directions when you're lost. How else would she find out about her dream proposal? Would A describe it for her? Doubt it. 

And honestly, one proposal shouldn't be the standard for how well B knows her partner. Nobody knows every little thing about their significant other because people WILL change over time, especially in long term relationships. The ""getting to know you"" phase never truly ends. 

Do not shame this woman for trying to make her partner happy."
d4epf4,NTA. I ride. Rider #2 messed up by not sticking with his buddy. You did your part. Thank you for sharing the road!
d4epmo,NTA. He‚Äôs 31 not 21. But it‚Äôs telling given his age to yours. Someone that old dating someone that young has some maturity issues. Someone his age wouldn‚Äôt put up with that shit and would have dumped him a while ago.
d4evl6,"Yes now that he's retiring you are legally required to stay at the company forever.

Come on NAH.  If you are getting another offer then just resign and give proper notice."
d4eycn,"NTA. I would only offer packing and moving help to get him out of the house. Or at a last resort I would help move your parents out.

Under no circumstances would I support that lifestyle.

Be clear, and be nice, ‚Äúsorry guys, but as you‚Äôve got 4 adults in one household, I can‚Äôt see any way possible my meager financial assistance would help this situation long term, maybe you (brother) could take a break from drinking to save up?‚Äù

If he whines about ‚Äúunfair‚Äù and ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt understand ‚Äú say this, ‚Äúyes, you are right, I don‚Äôt understand, which is why I can‚Äôt hand over money to help you continue to drink at mom and dads. It‚Äôs a final no. 

Smile and be nice, be firm. No need for anger."
d4f1s4,"NAH I won't fault you for wanting a relationship with a grandparent who has never personally harmed you, but I can't blame your mom for having a hard time with it. I'm assuming the abuse has done irreparable harm to her, and while it isn't your load to bear, it also isn't one your mom can easily forget, and I'm sure part of her thinks she's protecting you from the pain she endured."
d4f2he,"ESH - A cat doesn't understand a ""time out"" either.  Sounds like there's way too much to unpack here that has absolutely nothing to do with the poor cat. You should all stop playing power games with the critter."
d4f4dd,"NTA, you just took her words at face value. If she wanted you to cook for her, she should have asked you to."
d4f5q5,"Yta. They didn't just date, they were together for a decade. You throwing shade at your brother for having expensive hobbies and being a shut in feels like you trying to justify what you're doing. You did your brother wrong and you know it."
d4f7o8,NTA-That‚Äôs how tragedies begin.
d4f81p,YTA. You haven't been dating THAT long and your mom and him aren't close. Let him enjoy a free trip with his friends that he most likely won't see for a very long time. What would you rather do? Hang with your friends on a free vacation or go to a ceremony for his dad that you have almost no relationship with?
d4f82w,"NTA - your dad's reasons for forgiveness are worlds apart from yours. So there can be no expectation that you forgive her just because he did. 

The question I would ask your dad is what has your mom done to *earn* your forgiveness."
d4fax7,"ESH. SIL was a total ass for that comment. That being said, when my grandparents on my father's side passed, it was never expected that my maternal grandparents or my mom's siblings would come out for the funeral. No in-laws of any of my dad's siblings came either. You are acting entitled for expecting them to come. Besides, you say you have some issues with them and it sounds like they bring negativity. Frankly Im at a loss for why you would want them there."
d4fd6d,"NTA - your GF is a goddamn adult. She shouldn‚Äôt rely on you to take her out of awkward situations where no one is getting harmed. He was just talking to her.
If her friend was so concerned then he/she should have ‚Äúsaved‚Äù her. 

Tell her to grow up. You did the right thing."
d4fp48,"NAH 

Everyone is grieving, and grief does weird things to people. I think you're right that great-grandma would be understanding of your concerns. Grandma is also right in that great-grandma had requested the song be sung, so it should be considered as part of the service. Is there anyone else that could do it?"
d4fr4g,"Now, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be an asshole for saying something. However, I don‚Äôt think she would respond well to hearing your feelings on it. 

I have a feeling that she‚Äôs acting this way because she now feels like since she‚Äôs in a relationship (and so are you) that it needs to revolve around sex or that she may be in a hurry. She may even be making jokes/references to it even though she‚Äôs not absolutely comfortable with it. It seems like she is trying to come off that she is bragging about her sexual experiences in a low key way but isn‚Äôt as experienced as she is coming off as. 

I‚Äôm sure you can figure out some ways to even hint to her to tone it down a little without hurting her feelings or having it seem like you‚Äôre upset with her."
d4g46w,"NTA but you‚Äôre not wording this right. Just express you‚Äôre worried about her and if the person she‚Äôs dating is who they say they are. 

Btw, Not sure how your brother seeing someone has any bearing in this."
d4gajf,"Yeah YTA, you're acting immature (but you're immature). Drawing dicks isn't really funny.

And everything has a place, you don't go to your school with a swastika because you think swastikas are funny. Similarly you don't go to church and draw dicks.


You don't like going to church sure, rebel against your parents don't rebel against a faith because you're being forced to go"
d4gdib,"NTA- that sounds an awful lot like YOU are being punished equally for her mistakes. 

Why would you be responsible for basically babysitting her, and being the sole person who gets to decide how long shes outside? That's unfair to you. You arent her parent, you didnt mess up, and you shouldnt be made to be the prison warden. 

It doesnt matter if you are allowed to go inside whenever, what matters is youre being forced into deciding that FOR HER, and thus carrying out her punishment. 

That's jacked up. 

Hope everyone stays safe though! Both from the hellish heat and potential stalkers!"
d4gfah,"NTA. You are an adult and you need to do what‚Äôs best for your own life. It sounds like you‚Äôre very supportive of your mother, and she *does* have the support of your other siblings which she is for some reason rejecting. She‚Äôs not alone and it sounds like you are there for her. Don‚Äôt put your life on hold."
d4gnjw,"NAH - You need to put your career in front of anyone‚Äôs else‚Äôs, especially in college. It‚Äôs going to hurt you emotionally, but you don‚Äôt owe her anything; and if she‚Äôs a good friend, she‚Äôll understand that."
d4go9f,NTA you friend experiences trauma no excuse to be a dick head
d4grrh,"YTA. She's not washing them with your clothes mixed in, she lives there too and she's entitled to use the machine to wash a machine washable product. I've lived with guys who would toss jizz crusted sheets in the wash all the time. Not pleasant to think about, but it's what the machine is for."
d4gtin,"So you expect people to message you back instantly? It sounds like you were fishing for sympathy or pity. You made sure they knew you were mad, and that you were mad at them. They knew.

I knew people like you and I am inclined to say that you are TA.

Maybe people weren't ""there for you"" because you pull weird BS like this. And people not getting back to you instantly does not mean that they wouldn't have been there for you. What was your endgame? They text you back immediately and *then* you open up to them about your problems for support? Or they text you back immediately and *then* you jump on them like you did in the post?

Why couldn't you have just waited until they texted you back and said ""hey, you know I've been having some issues lately..."" 

You said ""I wanted a group of people who were there for me"". THEY TRIED TO BE THERE FOR YOU. They asked where you were and if you were okay. THAT IS BEING THERE FOR YOU. But you turned it around and made it into a big drama."
d4gufe,"NTA the clients are being cheapskates. If you expect a professional to travel to provide their services, you need to expect to pay for transit, housing, and per diem for food/incidentals."

d4gy10,NTA. That sounds like bad parenting. You did what everyone was thinking about doing.
d4h2eh,"NTA. It's your wedding! People need to learn to butt out of these things. Do what makes you and your soon to be spouse happy. You know what? Everyone is going to talk about your wedding one way or another. Someone was too late. The food needed more salt. Someone looked bloated.

Make it memorable to you! Have a great wedding

d4h3eb,"NTA and your sister has no business calling your bosses wife, she has absolutely crossed a line here! 

Time to tell her straight that she cheaps out on your babysitting for her, and her kids are exhausting, and you shouldn't have to make such excuses to get out of caring for them!

Man I dont know why people have kids when they automatically expect everyone else to be responsible for them."
d4h5sp,"I think 30 minutes for a shower is a long time especially if multiple people shower in the mornings. Showering with ur bf is also kind of weird with so many roommates, unless it had been discussed by all before. Yeah maybe your roomies are being dramatic. It sounds like all of you need to work on compromising and respecting shared spaces. I say ESH."
d4hb61,"YTA - ordering a drink for yourself and not her is inconsiderate, not offering her a sip of your Pepsi is just rude.

d4hewt,">I want to report them to the cops and the principle for carrying a knife, and I'm hoping that since they're adults they'll face severe criminal charges and be ruined for life.

I'd say NTA, but odds are that absolutely nothing will happen to them. They won't face severe criminal charges. They may not get any charges at all."
d4hg8t,"NTA. She's infertile so she suddenly has the right to impose her opinion on your life choices, and make you look like the bad guy? I don't think so. If she didn't want a lecture she shouldn't have shoved her opinion where it wasn't wanted."

d4hrcm,"NTA, you get to choose your friends, yay. You‚Äôre not obligated to maintain a friendship which sounds like you are mutually not enjoying."
d4hvji,"NAH but maybe the solution is that you gently discuss it with the boss to ask their opinion on the best way to distribute the workload - maybe you do take all the phone calls but the coworker does everything else. (No idea if that is possible... but I say let the boss decide how to give out the work, that way you can‚Äôt possibly be the asshole and you‚Äôre being respectful of your coworker‚Äôs needs."
d4hwgo,"NTA

Just because she's your partner doesn't mean she can tell you what to do. I'm sure you actually take on board what she's saying and just choose to do your own thing. 

This is her confidence issue."
d4i0ux,"NTA. Those are loan shark numbers, and your father took advantage of you by offering the loan.

Even worse, he seems to have purposely waited for the interest to add up by not pushing the issue earlier."
d4i5ty,"NTA - Your husband and other family members need to respect and acknowledge your fear of dogs. It may be inconvenient to move the dog to the backyard but when your mental health is at play, they're not taking you seriously. Ask someone to put the dog on a leash whenever you passing through, ""it's only a couple of days a month"""
d4i74s,"YTA 

But only to the extent that you made a mountain out of a mole hill. What do you care if she bins the rubbish? If it makes her happy then let it be."
d4i9ck,"Sorry but yeah, YTA. Leading someone on is never cool, even if it's just a friendship. I get it, you don't like conflict, but that's on you, not on her, and when you're an adult sometimes you have to deal with conflict, even if you don't like it. She may be oblivious to your hints, but some people are and that's not really their fault.

> I usually communicate in hints and body language 

This doesn't really work in adult relationships. You can't expect everyone to be able to read your mind. Time to put on your big girl pants and be honest with her, no matter how hard it is."

Lack of planning on their part does not necessitate a crisis on your part. You tried."
d4ihov,"It sounds like your stepmother was annoyed you invited someone home without checking first which sounds pretty reasonable if you are not paying bills there and especially reasonable if you are a child. 

Regardless of if you are a bill playing adult though, YTA. That‚Äôs not how you speak to people."
d4ins4,NTA - Consider your future; can you climb the corporate ranks and learn new interesting skills for your future from for friends business? Or will the other business be more rewarding. Your friend will understand if she/he wants the best for you.
d4ipwu,"NTA I completely understand why you would want to postpone it, everyone grieves in their own way and presuming it‚Äôs your event then you can choose to postpone it if you think that for the best."
d4ir13,Nta at all. I did the exact same when I was going through chemo and it helped me immensely. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have gotten through everything I was going through if I hadn‚Äôt. You do what you need to do to survive. Wishing you a speedy recovery
d4irtn,"NAH. It‚Äôs only this once and you have a fair reason. Surprised you‚Äôve managed to avoid getting ill for this long actually, so there‚Äôd be no point giving in just as he‚Äôs starting to recover."
d4is2o,"YTA. You were in someone's home and it was on you to watch your kid. Otherwise, whatever she breaks is your responsibility. Get a toddler harness or something. 

Also, why did you just leave without even trying to apologize? 

It's also very unlikely that a woman trying to sell her house left out something that was broken, hoped a kid would handle it and then she could hit people with the bill. It's way more likely she was displaying something nice because it made the house look posh, the way people put fresh flowers in a house they're trying to sell, and your kid broke it."
d4iu5w,"ESH - I love Terraria but it's a game, and definitely not one ruining a friendship over!"
d4iuzq,NTA your roommates are dicks. Because they were not accommodating at all (could have went somewhere else) and they didn‚Äôt even tell you they were having a party which they should always give you a heads up no matter what your sleep issue are like.
d4j46r,NTA. You should always do what you feel is right and in this case you did the hard thing but also the right thing. Well done! Don‚Äôt doubt yourself
d4j6n2,"YTA
I'm not gay but I know outing someone is a pretty big no-no. Even the hate filled, demons in their closet, need to come to grips with their own queerness, gays. 
It sounds like the people he has surrounded himself with are not making it safe for him to come out. 

Next time you come across a person like him, just don't give them anymore of your time or energy. Move on."
d4j7qk,"NTA
Your brother should respect your wishes"
d4ja6r,"NTA. Some words can‚Äôt be taken back and unheard. You made the effort to reach out before purchasing to let him know it wasn‚Äôt personal, which was kind."
d4jgb6,"NTA. 

Your mother wanted plasters. You forgot plasters. She's annoyed. Fair enough right?

You make amends by going to get plasters. She's more annoyed - and that my friends, is what we call an asshole move (by her, not you)."
d4jlw0,"NTA. Your house, your rules. They want to ignore the sign, then they can pay the price of having their time wasted. In sales time is money, so your point would be quickly received when you started costing them one or both of those things."
d4jmg3,"NTA: You're a grown up, you showed them respect by letting one of them know your plans, thats more than you needed to do."
d4joe0,What do you actually want judgement on?  This just seems like a description of something that happened.
d4jogm,"Ehhh NTA, bot you could‚Äôve phrased it better. Saying that you‚Äôre not with her for her looks is, to a woman, calling her ugly. I would apologize and say something along the lines of: ‚ÄúI love you because of your personality, but your beauty is just a plus. I would still love you no matter what you looked like.‚Äù"
d4jq5f,NTA - Call the police for a noise complaint. It's usually anonymous anyways. He wouldn't know that it was you.
d4jr32,"YTA, you don‚Äôt wipe your hands on other people‚Äôs stuff. If you have nothing else you wipe on your pants first. Secondly, it is not your house, you don‚Äôt get to say whether or not people are allowed to have pets in the house. It‚Äôs clearly a friendly dog and won‚Äôt hurt anyone. Third, you are coming across as very passive aggressive throughout this whole post. You‚Äôre mad at the father for having dog that lives inside the house. You‚Äôve made it very clear that you just hate the dog."
d4jrd7,NTA. Either you need to reevaluate your friendships or you left something out of the story.
d4juxb,"NTA

Wtf is with everyone saying you‚Äôre TA?
As a minor, it‚Äôs your parents responsibility to make sure you can complete your schooling and transportation to school is part of it. 

Do you have any friends close by that can drive you?"

d4k0uc,"NTA. As somebody who has had jobs with variable schedules over the years, mowing around 8PM is sometimes inevitable. Furthermore, unless your city has very strict quiet hours, 8pm will rarely qualify as a violation. Lastly, you offered a compromise and she wasn't willing to work with you."
d4k131,"NTA. She sounds like someone who is terrified of dogs and any move your dog made was bound to scare her shitless. Most likely he got up and went to smell her and she was scared. That's her issue not yours. Yes, dogs do turn, but they don't just do it for shits and giggles. They are abused, they are hurt, they are frightened, or protecting themselves or another. I believe that had he wanted to attack her there would have been way more noise than just her screaming. Why do I think this?

I have an aggressive dog who protects my home. He also has a cancerous brain tumor and it has caused personality changes. He's never been aggressive at public shared spaces until recently and it's always over a larger dog playing with him too rough or being too into him. He's loud when he's mad. He barks. He snarls. He growls. It is not a quiet affair.

In the future I simply would not invite her and if she shows up I would politely ask her to leave given this is his home not hers and you don't want to have another incident."
d4k1ol,"NAH. However, if she does it again."
d4k29b,NTA.   Your  mom put you in this position and you followed through.  You father went from acting like a child to straight up abusive.
d4k3ql,"NTA, she‚Äôs the worst kind of woman. You want to learn about feminine stuff go on makeup advice, you don‚Äôt need people like that"
d4k977,NTA.  And their lack of response to her made her continue to want to get the snow globe.
d4khka,"Because this is a situation where she has already shown disrespect for you: NTA. Your rant was built up, not just something spontaneous.

For the record, the ""I'm still poor"" mindset affects a lot of people. Either because they grew up poor, they feel the need to justify their wealth, or because they think their troubles outweigh the wealth. That said, I'd be cautious about all this. You may mistakenly label their broken bones as papercuts."
d4klun,Driver ate the lunch
d4knae,YTA. This is all just assumption after assumption. You should ask her about how she's feeling and offer support..Not shut her down and make her feel bad for being sad..
d4kpx9,NTA. You didn't ask for compensation or anything. Just a stupid ride somewhere. And they are gonna be dicks about that? Fuck no.
d4kqw4,"NTA this guy is a huge douche. Everyone deserves to get a chance to snowboard, no matter what skill level they‚Äôre at"
d4kwx1,"YTA. Damn kid, you are entitled. 

Nobody owes you Pokemon cards *or* a new cell phone. Yeah I know it's annoying to hear about things a thousand times, but that's the price of getting shit from your parents. There may come a day where you'd be glad to endure a lecture in exchange for some financial help."
d4l5dd,"This feels like the friend version of he‚Äôs not that into you. He‚Äôs checked out emotionally, OP... sounds like he has you as a back-up pal only ... it‚Äôs harsh to hear but know that there will other friends (please believe that). Take a few steps back from this friendship while not completely checking out. Stay friends but I‚Äôd not stay as emotionally invested as before if it were me. Move on and spend time with other friends."

Do NOT, whatever you do, perform the same work for less pay. If they can't afford you, then they don't get that work. End of story."
d4lfhw,"NAH.

I know that situation. People should be more responsible and take more consideration that other people also need to use it.

So as long as you put them on a clean place its all good.

The other side is no asshole too, because sometimes you just cant do it"
d4lfi2,"NTA: While she's free to be with someone new, there is no need to be so inconsiderate of your feelings. 

Sometimes people like to show off how well their doing post breakup, it just seems unnecessary to me."
d4lgfy,"ESH - You both are being petty and should stop doing this until you are mature about constructive criticism (both with receiving AND giving). Sit down and have a conversation about how you feel when she corrects you and how you both need to be encouraging each other more than hounding each other. Criticism is fine as long as it‚Äôs, again; constructive, and also objective. Be just as complimentary, if not more-so, too."
d4lmd1,NTA it‚Äôs understandable you didn‚Äôt want to go. Maybe you could give a little insight if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs making you feel some guilt. They will understand.
d4lpi7,NTA. I'm sorry you've been made to feel responsible for your mother. Look into Al-Anon or Alateen.
d4lpub,"NTA.  They are yours to do with as you please, you have every right to sell them.  Get some money from them with no qualm."
d4lqaw,"NAH

I think you made the right decision for your mental well being. Sure, you went back on your word, but sometimes that needs to happen depending on the circumstances.

That being said, I think you need to reach out and explain you now realize you need space to get over her first before making any decisions about how to handle contact. It's healthier this way."
d4lvm3,NTA. Considering I couldn't find any Hublot watches for under 30k when I perused Google I don't see how anyone could claim money troubles when they're wearing 1/8 of my house on their wrist. Is your mom blind?
d4lx80,"NTA. If you're telling the truth then Alex is a massive douchebag, and you, as it often tends to happen, got in between of some couple drama."
d4lx8q,"NAH. I fully understand your point, it is a change for him. However, I actually agree more with her. Especially at his age, you all need separate private areas. That‚Äôs what your bedrooms are, you and your wife have your bed/bath and he has his own bed/bath. As his parents, I‚Äôm sure you give him a reasonable amount of privacy and it‚Äôs absolutely reasonable for her to want a space that is ‚Äúy‚Äôalls.‚Äù You didn‚Äôt say anything at all about their relationship, so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs fairly good to your knowledge (taking into account preteen/teenager hormones and ‚Äústep-mom‚Äù)."
d4lxcu,"YTA - You did it for spite. Anytime you do something for spite, you are an asshole.
Edit: I also think that the person who outed the bioparents is a huge asshole, but I would be very surprised if they did so without giving op some context as to the why they gave him /her up to another family."
d4m08v,"Nope. Not an asshole and that's not a friendship, I would say you are better off. Motherly advice here, take it or leave it: Dont be friends with people who dont add joy to your life. It doesn't have to be all the time but once the scale starts to tip where you are unhappy more than you are unhappy do exactly what you did."
d4m0mi,"NTA but if he doesn't want to talk to you and you don't live in the same city, what's the point of staying in the relationship?"
d4m2xi,Tread lightly with this. I believe she can file a suit if you say her medical condition is the reason she was let go. Failing to do the job adequately is an okay reason but leave her medical issues out of it.
d4m3wr,"NTA.... What she's doing damages their education and the quality of teaching at your University. If you're not doing it just because you are jealous, ( and you should think long and hard about that) it's the right thing to do.

Having said that, I think you should speak to her first and let her know your concerns. Give her a chance to change her behaviour. But if she can't, or won't, there are people much better suited to her job that deserve it much more."
d4m45e,NTA since nothing has been bought or paid for. Sounds like your friend is selfish and a little insecure. If you got bigger things on your plate take then you gotta do things to compensate (i.e don't go on that trip). You gotta do you first. Also who plans a trip with 14 hour non-flight travel times? That sounds like a nightmare.
d4m5rb,"absolutely NTA 
It's your dog but you didn't call him over and you didn't put the glass where it was. He is a good boy."
d4m63j,"NAH she‚Äôs completely valid in wanting to break up with you if you go long distance, no need to be forced into long distance. you‚Äôre completely valid in wanting to better yourself and go to a better medical school (definitely the better choice if that‚Äôs the one you have to make) you shouldn‚Äôt stay for a relationship you‚Äôre not sure would even last you should do what will better yourself"
d4m77t,"I totally disagree. I think a lot of the asshole comments aren't fully considering what going into medicine takes. Imagine law school, make it a dozen times worse, triple the length, and then add the fun of the potential for accidental murder.

The path is beyond brutal. There's the studying. The stress. The tests. The steps. The residency application process. The match, which could send OP and his wife to another part of the country for residency because there are no guarantees and derm is wildly, ludicrously competitive, disrupting his ability to continue working to support them, particularly with how hard it can be to find law jobs these days. The long hours in residency and the long hours after residency.

I'm married to a doctor. We got together right before he started med school so our entire relationship has been medicine. I've made two cross-country moves for this. It dominates every facet of our lives. It's horrendous. A vast majority of relationships end in med school; we're one of like two from his program that made it. And the best part? My husband, and the vast majority of his coworkers, wouldn't do it again. My husband says he'd be a CRNA for sure if he could go back in time. But he's stuck on this path because he has $400,000 in debt, which is also just wonderful.

Medicine isn't for the faint of heart. At 33 with no undergrad and a family? That ship has pretty much sailed.

ETA: I didn't even really address the derm part of the equation. It's the hardest specialty, up there with ortho. Most successful derm candidates go to top schools, do an immense amount of research (some even take a year or two off after med school to beef up their resumes), and shoot for any position in any hospital anywhere in the country. And most of those people fail. There are way, way, way more derm wannabes than derm spots. Shooting for derm makes the standard realities of medical education about a dozen times harder.

ETA 2: yay gold! My first ever!! My husband will be so proud that it was on a post tearing his career path apart (and I mean that seriously).

ETA 3: Since someone pointed it out, NTA. I somehow forgot that bit. OP is NOT the asshole. Anyone who is even considering medicine should know the blood, sweat, money, relationship strife, chaos, time, sanity, and actual tears that go into the process of becoming a doctor."
d4m7dp,"They don't invite you out but they invite themselves round? NTA,your house, your decisions."
d4mcwj,NAH. You are allowed to ask and she is allowed to refuse. You don't have to kiss anyone for any reason what so ever. Don't be surprised if she dumps you through.
d4md52,YTA. Visibly 'upset and out of it' but still chose to abandon her for video games with your friends.
d4mdvg,"NTA - She was being totally disrespectful to the entire family by doing this. There is no need to leave it out on the counter. It's also GROSS af to have a used vibrator sitting on the counter where people brush their teeth, etc. 

Maybe it's time to start charging some rent."
d4meex,"YTA. Just go get the damn license. You have a finite amount of battles to pick in your life, is this really one of them?"
d4mhn9,Yes.  YTA. Holding a door open for others -- not just women -- is common courtesy.  These kinds of basic courtesies for others goes directly to your character.   You can be better and it costs you nothing.
d4mj8t,"ESH. Season ticket seats are a pretty expensive commitment to just blow off because you're having an argument. I can see where she'd be seriously mad.

However, you're both silly for thinking an 11 month old is going to enjoy a professional football game.  Regardless of your mom's attitude, it would have been a nightmare for you trying to keep a baby calm in the middle of a roaring crowd."
d4mki9,"NTA, and neither is your dad. Your sister sounds like a dippy little shit. She must take after your mom. 

I would say, though, that these things will continue to happen if you ever become content with being the victim. Next time you find yourself eating alone, look around for some other person eating alone, and join them. You both might benefit greatly from the company, and make a new friend. 

One day your sister will mature and realize the importance of siblings. When it happens, don‚Äôt expect an apology, but find it in yourself to internally forgive, and grow the relationship. She will need your guidance on the road to becoming a better person."
d4mlip,"NTA

d4mmeh,"YTA: If she is a model she is going to have to work with photographers both male and female.

If you can't trust here to not cheat then the relationship is doomed anyway but you can't just assume something is going on because you are weird about her chosen work."

d4mp9q,"NTA. Not all heroes wear capes, friend."
d4mrd5,"NTA, you were actually way more understanding and patient than I would ever be in this situation. I would not be okay at all to have my boyfriend accept to go out or even stay in touch with someone who spat on his face, tried to ridicule me and openly admitted to wanting him back.

d4nkzl,"NAH. I get that you feel bad about it, but it was an honest mistake. It happens. The manager didn't have any problems on it either, she helped you out of free will. Don't make or see problems when there are none :)"
d4no2x,"OP, I think it says it all that you came to a place asking if you were an ""Asshole"" for feeling this way.

Frankly, it sounds like a part of your treatment will require you learning that maybe people just like and care for you for who you are, and that they aren't doing you a favor or would otherwise prefer to be somewhere else. Your friend obviously cares about you, and you have the great fortune of having people there that recognize your pain and want to help.

I have had many close friends like this, that seem to hate themselves for needing the support of friends when its a problem that cant just be fixed, when they seem THEMSELVES as the problem.

But the things with friends is, is THEY will need YOU one day, after you've learned how to manage your mental illness, and the commitment they made to you know will come to roost. And even though Ive had more smiles and laughs doing other things, theres nothing better than the closeness and importance of being there for a friend in a tough time.

You're not an asshole to your friend, but you're being an asshole to yourself by convincing yourself you are only a negative force in your friend's life. You deserve to have friends that care for you, and I think you should tell your friend you appreciate what they are for you."
d4nr82,"YTA.  You are a guest in her home.  You gave her the guitar.  you would be leaving soon enough.  Your SO showed by example the polite response: leave the room.  Go for a walk, sit outside.  Do anything but shit on your host.  

If your host was not your sister, would have responded the same?  

Next time you visit, why not pay for a hotel or ABNB?"
d4nsnu,YTA. White lies are kinda a one and done deal. If you‚Äôre constantly having to lie about the same thing over and over again it‚Äôs not a ‚Äústupid white lie‚Äù it‚Äôs just a full blown lie.
d4nt34,"NTA - you didn't sign a lease, and mold is a health concern. You have not made a commitment to stay."
d4nw3i,NTA just remember it when they expect you to go to their wedding in Malta or some shit
d4nwmw,NTA at all but be prepared for an almighty argument.
d4ny1w,"NTA - if you are paying him back for everything, I don't see the issue. Sounds like your parents don't see the value in you getting a more powerful PC but if you can afford it, it's your decision."
d4nyq9,"YTA: If your watching something in a public space, people may come in. It's probably also not the most appropriate movie to watch where there might be people popping by."
d4o2ac,NTA. Your dad already got to name a child. Using Jacob as a middle name would be a graceful gesture.
d4o6cy,NTA. You said he wanted to put lava under the chests maybe to burn your items. You did the right thing and I'm pretty sure your friends will want you to do the same thing.
d4o859,"NTA. No one is ever entitled to your money. You are in a tight spot yourself and if anyone should understand, it's your uncle. Don't donate, don't feel guilty and don't qualify it. ""No"" is a complete sentence. 
I hope things look up for you soon and congratulations on the soon to be little one!"
d4o8zq,I have never understood why keeping the confidence of a third party is damaging to a marital relationship. You are NTA if you honor your daughter's boundaries.
d4oehi,[deleted]
d4oiuc,NTA. Doing fun things and having a social life is just as important as sleep and studying for it all to work out well. Tell them you need some time to kick back and relax/have some fun.
d4oj4c,"NAH. It‚Äôs really hard to be tired, introverted, and have someone demand your attention. It‚Äôs also hard to be extroverted, confined at home, and have no one to talk to."
d4ojwi,NTA. It is so annoying to me when someone rejects you or breaks up with you and then gets all pissy if you don't want to be friends. Guarantee she just wants to keep you on the line in case it doesn't work out with the new guy.
d4oqen,"NTA, I'm also a college professor and I do that all the time when there are students who are left without a group. If the rules are four, it is four. It is good that you went to the professor directly. Good luck in your project"
d4osbq,"This isn‚Äôt a AITA post. 
But there‚Äôs some phrase, that if you always say: no to the party, you‚Äôll stop getting invited... you‚Äôve said that‚Äôs not your gig, you act like it‚Äôs not your gig, so, people don‚Äôt keep asking you if it‚Äôs your gig. 

You can be sad, hurt or whatever but their actions are expected and expectable. If you don‚Äôt wanna be sad about it, then don‚Äôt, ever you can stop being sad and understand where they are coming from or change your behavior and let them know you‚Äôd like to try going to more events. 

Good luck AlantheMexican"
d4osh7,"NTA. Not only will she receive the care she needs from people qualified to do so, you are under no obligation to halt or alter your life to care for a sibling if this is not what you want yourself. It was your sister's choice to give in to your parents' pressure, but you have the choice not to."
d4osz7,jesus.. nta.. i don't even know where to start with this mess
d4ouau,"Oh my god, let it go. YTA if you move in with your ex when you're clearly still upset about what went on between you in the past."
d4ovzw,"YTA. Because of this ...

>I kept telling her that it doesnt matter 

It may not matter to you, but it clearly matters to her, so much so that she can scarcely think of anything else. If you truly care about her, you would understand that. You said that results come out next weekend, is it really so hard to put up with her fretting about her grade for one more week? Don't you want to support her? After all, it's not like it's been years, just a month. When people are afraid, it usually consumes them. She needs you by her side, not dismissing her fears."
d4p1dm,"NTA.

I do not think you are the asshole for being upset over this. 

While yes your friend was doing a nice thing to make sure your okay. She took it way too far, to go through your things looking for alcohol is rude."
d4p1l1,"YWBTA. You‚Äôre not the only one being overcharged, so no, you can‚Äôt keep this all for yourself. Really it‚Äôs as simple as that."
d4p1yo,">this is only temporary since once she gets ""in"" then I am sure my family will love her.

Are you sure your family isn't a cult? Look, I'm from the south too and I get the family issue and how everyone is in everyone's business, but if you're a grown up, at some point you have to man-up and stand behind the person you love. You clearly made her feel like she wasn't good enough. A lengthy list of do's and don'ts? Seriously? Yes, YTA."
d4p3cg," ""because Im going with A, that it‚Äôs very weird and that more people, like mum and bestfriend agree with her.""

You're GF is complaining about this to other people? That's childish. NTA as long as you both have separate rooms, go on your trip."
d4p3yg,"NTA, especially since your roommate throws cat poop in the kitchen trash can. Who does that? And on top of that, to not ever clean the litter box is disgusting."
d4p7us,"NAH. Harm reduction is very very very important. Having a friend's mom who allowed us to partake in her house definitely kept me and my friends out of trouble, and potentially even kept us alive"
d4p7y3,NTA - Lisa is insane. she needs to stop trying to force a relation between the two of you and the fact she wont let bob leave to hang out with you because He DoEsNt CaRe AbOuT mE is just stupid and childish
d4p8pt,"YTA idk the laws of where you live but even so, it‚Äôs his house and his responsibility to care for it. He warned you ahead of time and you‚Äôre acting as if you guys are the only ones with things to do."
d4pd9n,"NTA. I get that she likes astronomy or whatever, but she wants you to drive 6 hours on a Friday night just to watch a video of a previous solar eclipse? And she‚Äôs got plans the next afternoon? Meaning you (presumably) would have to drive back even if you stayed the night. That seems pretty selfish to me. If it was a real solar eclipse then maybe it‚Äôd be worth it. 

Good luck man."
