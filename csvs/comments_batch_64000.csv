d4rpf0,"ESH. You set a spending limit of 1000$ and then you immediately broke that limit for some fancy instrument you insist is now partly yours just because of the cost. You bring it up in arguments years later and seem to care more about the cost of the gift then the meaning behind it. All of that makes you TA.

However I agree that your wife is TA for getting you such a simple and cheap gift. If it had been something a little more personal but still cheap not so much. Or if she had put attention and care into picking it out then that would be different.

You two might need to see someone because obviously there are some disagreements on what exactly you both expect out of each other and your marriages. You're very clearly not on the same page here and if you want things between you to work you need to bridge this gap soon."
d4rq4p,NAH.  Consider requesting a quieter keyboard from management using their complaints as reasoning.
d4rtv6,"You would be setting yourself up for a distant, nonphysical, and potentially resentful relationship with your kids. There are plenty of places in the US you can move to have a richer social life without making yourself basically unreachable by your children the majority of the time."
d4rtvi,"You’re not an asshole, just a dingus. Tell your freakin parents, what’s the worst that could happen? They’re supportive? Stop being a dingus and tell them, so if it is MS you have a support system"
d4ru8z,Take it to a shelter. If they ask what happened tell them idk you leave it out all day.
d4ruk7,"However you decide to proceed, don’t let your parents pick up the slack.  If he wants a third of the result without anything near a third of the work- tell him to buy his fuel.  

Or do jobs for your parents around the house the rest of the year to earn it. I understand your annoyance though, particularly after their comments a few years ago"
d4rvna,"NTA, because it's not necessarily the money you're upset about. You've been betrayed by the two men you trusted most and who insisted on nurturing your dependence on them, only to have them both screw you. Over other women. Your father's betrayal rings similarly to your ex husband's. You are justified in your anger, you are not the asshole."
d4rvt0,"> He just simply said what he felt at the moment

He badgered you for some time to get permission to use that word, then admits in a bout of anger, that this is what felt natural for him. You're NTA, just naive.  Someone asking for permission to use that word against you is a racist, and no friend of yours."
d4rwed,YTA She’s pregnant and their relationship comes first. It won’t make sense to you because you’re not in the relationship. You have no idea why she has trust issues and you need to just accept and respect it. Your emotions aren’t a priority here.
d4rwqo,"I hate to say it, but YTA here.. You said it first and she just agreed. Don't say something if you don't want it thrown back into your face. She didn't say you weren't pretty. Some people just have that ""exceptionally pretty"" thing going on for them. You need to work on your confidence. I am sorry that you feelings are hurt, but this situation really says more about your thoughts on yourself than anything else."
d4rx9a,"NTA - They went behind your uncle’s back in an attempt to get half of your gift back. If anything, they’re the asshole."
d4s0is,"YTA. She isn't asking you to be there for him, she's asking you to be there for her. Whether or not you give a fuck about this guy, she does. You're her family and she's hoping to get some support. Buck the fuck up and be there.

Edit: Also, most people aren't fans of hospitals, you're not in a unique situation, so that's a terrible excuse."
d4s429,NTA. Your friends need to grow up if that's all it takes to upset them to the point of calling you names.
d4s6hk,"YTA because you are using your girlfriend, if it was me I wouldn't appreciate it"
d4scuy,"NTA specifically because your friend has not kept you up to date on their apartment search and have not paid you for the resources you spend to care for the dog. 

However, YWBTA (relatively) if you did it without notice. Give the friend a hard deadline “ I no longer have the capability to care for your dog. You have to pick him up by XXXX or I will be taking him to XXXX shelter” and stick to the deadline. I also wouldn’t go into detail about WHY you can’t take care of the dog, or even that the friend hasn’t kept up hurt end of the bargain- just a Kurt “I can’t continue to care for the dog” and don’t let them argue"
d4se3p,YTA but only because you should never bleach clean hair. You should avoid washing for at least a day or two before bleaching. However you should also not pull her hair when you are drying it. It shouldn’t be hard to just ask her to turn her head.
d4seih,NTA. He's feeding you an excuse because he doesn't want to get married. You guys need to have a serious conversation about where your relationship is going.

d4sjaj,"I don't know where you are but in Australia people's property usually ends about 2 metres before the street. This land, called the nature strip or the verge is owned by the council even though the property owners maintain it. It's where a footpath or sidewalk would be if there was one.

Anyone can walk there whether it's grass or pavement so they don't have to walk on the street. If it's the same where you are then NTA. It's public land."
d4slgh,NTA of course. That’s so weird. Start being honest? Tell them when you want to go to bed and they need to go home. Or when “actually I don’t feel like hanging out today”

d4sstg,YTA. I asked you nicely to throw it away after cleaning it up multiple times before. I never called you “barbaric” either. The trash can is two feet away. We have candles.
d4tefp,"NTA, but the problem is you are expecting her to fill these friendship needs. I think you should be the one filling these needs by meeting new friends. And I'm not saying to drop/lose your current friendships."
d4tev4,"NTA.

However, I feel like this is more a job for r/legaladvice.   Screwing with their equipment, when they have an agreement with the land owner, could potentially put you in hot water.

A judge doesn't care whether or not you're an asshole."
d4tfe4,"NAH. 

I don't think you're an asshole but I think you two need to talk to each other about this if it's bothering you.

As a side note; my best friend and I have been friends for 17 years.  I'm male and she's female.  There never has been and never will be anything romantic between us.  I love her like a sister.  We regularly go out to eat together, or go to concerts together, or go to movies together and her boyfriend of 10 years knows and trusts me.  He and I have become friends too.

I think it's important to realize that friendships are important relationships too."
d4tghm,"YWBTA I'm Mexican, raise and born. I don't see anything wrong about the party itself, that's ok for me, you have my blessings. But don't have the ofrenda. They are only for el día del muerto, it would be extremely disrespectful if you have one."

d4thfc,"NTA.  she should’ve checked first and if it was her doing a kind gesture , she doesn’t have much of a right to be so angry"
d4tj41,"YTA even though AH feels too strong a word here. I’m using it as a stand in for you’re responsible. Anxiety is understandable and easy for me to find empathy for. 

1) You provided extra info in a comment that you would have been upset to leave alone, and it was asked because that is the obvious solution here. If you are not willing to leave alone when you need to then you are essentially saying that when you are anxious your partner needs to leave the situation with you to satisfy you. That simply isn’t reasonable. It sets your partner up to try to persuade you to stay, which seems like it’s running roughshod over your boundaries until you consider the fact that what she may be doing is making a case for HER to stay. I somehow doubt that her saying “okay babe, see you at home!” felt like an option. Please correct me if this is wrong. We can’t make other people responsible for our feelings in this way. It’s like holding hostage because her only option becomes to leave. It ultimately seems that you use an ultimatum to get her to leave without time to say goodbye. 

2) Snapping at others makes us the asshole. You were anxious and snapped, which is no different than being any other emotion and snapping. 

3) You seem to have said yes verbally and then held others to account for your discomfort when you didn’t uphold the boundary. Unless someone holds power over us in an important way or our autonomous action is blocked in a meaningful way we are responsible for upholding our own boundaries."
d4tv0b,"Move Out.  Stop going to dinner with your parents.  Stop taking vacations with your parents.  Move into the most sad apartment imaginable and find your own way.  Those are, oddly, the best years of your life.  If you stay, you know the stupid dynamic you are in and you choose to stay. No asshole judgement here.  But if you stay in this dynamic, you are assholing yourself."
d4twf6,"NTA.. MIXED feelings.. even if the circumstances aren’t that good just give the person a heads up, say your peace & go. but he also sounds kinda gross/needs to do better so hey lol. at least your out"

d4tzcf,"NTA - unless she lays rent then she can fuck off. Your roommate is babied and needs to cut her off a bit. 

I’d be lounging in my boxers watching Netflix when they show up because I’m just petty like that."
d4tzkv,"NTA., this one is personal for me too. My father in law LIVES IN MY APARTMENT COMPLEX. No exaggeration, I can see his front door from my front door. He hasn’t seen my kids in a year and a half (besides passing by in cars). My Mother in law lives 5 minutes away and can’t see our kids do to her hectic golf schedule... it’s been about 10 months or so... And my parents live about 20 minutes away and if I text them right now at 10pm and asked if they wanted to see my kids, I bet my Dad could make it here in only 18... 
you are absolutely not the asshole for expecting the relationship to be two sided. If they complain, they’re welcomed to visit you.. also remind them that they’re the ones who told you to leave because they were done with your son.. I mean who says that??"
d4u135,">he refuses to let me take my implant out

What the Kentucky fried fuck? NTA. Are you sure this dude is worth it?"
d4u2cj,"Yes, Yta if you do this. This is crabs in a bucket. You got out and they want to pull you back in because it's where they are comfortable keeping you. What you need to do is stop tolerating it. 

I will not discuss this any more. I don't want to hear any more comments on it. If you keep saying this stuff, I will leave. Then when they do, leave. Every. Single. Time. Eventually they will either stop mentioning it or you'll realize they care more about their comfort than your health and that they're not worth it."
d4u8yx,"NTA.

If she were to let you know ahead of time, it would be different.  But she's not telling you when she does it, and broke her promise when she made it.  I think you two definitely need to at least talk about *letting you know ahead of time* if she drives her friend home."
d4uac6,"YTA 

You REALLY need to move on from this. And if you can't, then get professional help."
d4uebf,"NTA 

If you genuinely feel that you have received sub-standard care then the reporting process is there for precisely that. That said, a misdiagnosis doesn't necessarily equal malpractice (though it can it some cases). Just don't do it out of revenge. If you report them, do it to improve outcomes for their other patients. 

I'm not ready to say that the doctor isn't the asshole here, hence the NTA."
d4ui4i,"ESH.. and I definitely mean EVERYONE for one reason or another. You for trying to dictate who attends your estranged father’s funeral, your parents for not respecting your lack of religion and not sticking up for you, your uncle/cousins for not respecting your lack of religion, and your husband for manipulating you with his illness. This just sounds like one giant clusterfuck that takes a paid professional to unravel."
d4ullo,"NAH- I can understand the concern but bringing it up now would create an issue when there isn't one. Like you said, that is something he should be telling her, and it didn't mean anything so it's not worth mentioning, especially 4 years later."
d4uo3c,"NTA. You sent your portion on time as requested. Their failure to do their part does not constitute you chipping in towards the late fee that was solely incurred by them not paying on time.

Plus, where the hell is $125 the “late fee”? I suggest you require documentation for every bill you chip in towards."
d4uow8,ESH are y’all 12?
d4upjw,NTA. I have no sympathy for cheaters. The divorce is a direct result of a shitty choice she made.
d4uqre,"NTA, just don't be an A-hole about it, aka, set their stuff in a neat pile on a table or on top of a machine, not on the floor - lived in a dorm, people did this all the time"
d4urim,"Honestly YTA for agreeing in the first place. It's an event that was important to your GF and you bailed on half of it and flubbed the rest. I understand just how exhausted you were, but ultimately you made the commitment knowing full well of your work schedule/potential low energy level following your shift.

Also, this post is entirely about your fatigue and your aches and the huge inconvenience to you the wedding was. No concern to your GF (who likely RSVP'd for you) at all. That says a lot."
d4uyrp,NTA.  I don't want you sneezing all over my food either.  There are other types of jobs in the world.
d4v3d7,"Provided your parents are alright with you being stoned for pickup, NAH. Do consider that coming across like you chose not to drive just so you could get stoned will make you at least look like a total asshole, and remember to act well on public transport no matter your state and not to get stoned to the point where people on the bus are gonna be like legit worried about your behaviour in some way. (same rules as drinking)"
d4v85i,"NTA. 

It is your friend who is in the wrong. Your friend is the asshole. You do not confess to someone in a committed relationship unless you're telling them because you've got to ghost them for a while to get over your feelings and it's 1000% not them so they shouldn't feel bad... and even then it's a bit weird. **You do not ask for an increase in physical intimacy form someone who has just rejected you**. 

Not only is it not on you to comfort someone you reject, not only are you not obligated to give up or bend your bodily autonomy just to make someone feel better, **but you also acted well by refusing to hug because you refused to send any potential mixed signals at all.**"

You're absolutely a shit friend.

If you developed feelings for her over time, and then talked to him about dating her, that would be one thing, and you'd be in the clear.

d4vf4f,"Wait, what? 

You didn’t want to wear the shirt if the band you were going to see? Is that a thing?

d4vj3r,NAH. You can ask and they can refuse.
d4vjtd,"Whoa. This is way above this subreddit's pay grade.


You need to get into therapy stat, with or without her (hopefully with). This was clearly on her, but it's frightening to read that you feel like a failure as a husband because of her incredibly questionable choices. Those are some pretty intense words.

d4vzmc,"NTA - You’re a human, man. You need time to heal up after getting rejected. All good, it happens. Won’t be the last time something like this happens. 

I think she’s being a little callous and doesn’t understand that it takes some stones to tell someone how you feel and that after a negative result, want some time to get your shit together before you reengage communications. 

If I was you’d I’d tell her exactly that. That you wanted some time to get your  feelings in check before continuing communication again. If she can’t  understand that your radio silence was nothing personal and continues to think it was a “get in my pants”  scenario, I just wouldn’t even bother being her friend then. Good luck homie."
d4w32b,"My whole thing is that the roommate literally sat everyone down and asked for their help with something they are struggling with, and OP is just annoyed they can't put food in the kitchen.

d4w6u1,NTA and they aren't customers if they dont buy shit
d4w7bg,NTA Once you get a dog it's your responsibility to ensure it can learn to behave in a way that doesn't bother others. Your roommate is incredibly irresponsible and she's not doing her dog a favor. She should definitely TRAIN him to stay down when saying Hi to people. Also she should train him to stay off the couch and that inside isn't the right place for wild games. Maybe you can talk some sense into her by telling her that she should do it for the dog. He could get hurt by playing so wildly or worse hurt someone and then have to pay the price for her failure to train him.

d4z570,NTA. You should NEVER be shouting at your SO in public. I've gotten really annoyed and slightly raised my voice in frustration at my SO in public and instantly realized it was not okay in the slightest. It was 100% her fault i wasnt even being a dick like your father in law seems he was being. BUT just because youre annoyed of frustrated doesn't mean you need to raise your voice. Even if you're 100% in the right shouting at somebody infront of other people is an asshole move. Makes the person feel like shit and embarrassed them. If you didn't say anything she would have probably thought she was in the wrong. Fuck that dude.

d4ztyu,"NTA. What you said was pretty restrained. I’m sure she has heard worse for her actions.  Also, it takes two to tango. Your sibling isn’t in the clear either.  Only say to her what you would say to your sibling."
d4zwp6,"NTA. And the fact that you are their son does not obligate you to live in their house forever. And you are not obligated to share living expenses if you don’t actually live in that house. You warned them with plenty of time about what would be happening. 

Please, take the role and move to where you need to, and don’t let your parents guilt you out of a great opportunity. Heck, if I had an opportunity like this I would jump at it! You are not your parents’ keeper and don’t let them talk you into thinking you are."
d4zx04,NTA earning money doing something you love? A lot of people can only dream of that
d4zy3f,"NTA, please don’t out your friend"
d50114,"NTA. Typically when you go to a place that has a different culture, you make sure you understand that culture and act appropriately. Asking the culture to be more accommodating for the visitor seems way less efficient. 

Also when you said it was in the 90s I thought you meant the decade. It took me a second and a half to realize that you meant the temperature."
d503ft,"NTA.

You weren't being an asshole (hell she deserved to be snapped at) but you were being unprofessional."
d5075q,"NAH.  I don't disagree with the rationale that ""your yard, your business.""  But the same applies to the neighbor.  If she's in her house, your actions shouldn't be affecting her, either.  I.e., she shouldn't have to keep all her windows closed in her own house to accommodate your smoking.  You're not an asshole for smoking in your yard.  She's not an asshole for not wanting your smoke to affect her in her house."
d507xy,"Oooh, that is a fantastic idea, and we are getting ready for a big upgrade to our auditorium. I'll make that suggestion. Thanks, fellow Redditor!"
d50a5q,"YTA. They did y'all a huge favor for a very poorly trained dog. I would, at minimum, pay them the 300."
d50b9w,"NTA. Expressing concern for injured animals is a pretty normal human response. Chances are your roommate is concerned but is worried that by admitting guilt they would be liable for the cost of the vet visit. Which they are. Your roommate is definitely the asshole here.

EDIT. I'm beginning to think I may have overreacted. I don't actually know if your roommate is responsible for the cost of the vet visit. That's an r/legaladvice topic. I do believe they should take responsibility for their pets actions though."
d50cm6,"NTA. Holding the door for people is common decency, and any woman interpreting it as “special treatment” because of her gender is just looking for things to get upset about."

Poor guy probably just wants this whole situation to go away and you saying something probably isn't helping that outcome. You didn't do anything *wrong* but also didn't help the situation since it resulted in more drama. Honestly, I'd stay out of this from here on out."
d50tkk,"NTA. I’m guessing that she was already stressing out from a noisy classroom and either you and your friend were unlucky, the giggle was the straw that broke the camel’s back, or she picked on you two because she knew you’d obey."
d50zye,"YTA. 

How is this any different than asking someone to pass the salt and pepper? If you have to ""get up"" to be able to reach the salt and pepper, you're probably reaching too far and it's better to ask a person closer to pass it to you."

Jesus why are you even with this person?
You need someone who understands your needs and treats you with compassion and respect 
This guy sounds abusive and will probably get worse over time"
d511an,"Big yikes. YTA. It’s her house and she’s allowed to decide when she wants company and when she doesn’t. Her reasons were also 100% valid. She has obligations outside of your relationship and space is good for everyone. 

Also, it’s pretty immature to refuse to speak to her until she apologizes. Especially since she has absolutely nothing to apologize for. Giving the silent treatment and pushing people away when you don’t get what you want is super toxic and manipulative. At the bare minimum, you owe HER an apology for this behavior."
d512pt,"NTA - it’s totally natural for you to want your own space in your home. I love my mom but if she were at my house every single day I’d get annoyed too. 

It sounds like maybe she doesn’t feel super “at home” in her new place and feels more comfortable at yours. Maybe ask her gently if that’s the case and suggest hanging out at her new house together?

Edit because typo"
d5136k,"NTA - She has two fully capable helpers right now. The only decisions you can make are based on the ""right now"" not the ""what if""."
d513c1,NTA - Sounds like you need to replace the hole that your mother left with more communication with your sister.
d517um,"NTA

And...(you don’t want to hear this) but you “fix it” by leaving him alone.

Anyone with addiction issues that are not addressed is NOT capable of being in a relationship.  It will “suck the life” out of you.  Energy vampires.

d518ge,"NAH. He's comfortable living like that, but it bothers you. Sounds like you're just not particularly compatible, so asking him to move out is fine.

d51e31,"NTA but have you considered working with her to get her own desktop, especially given this new hobby software?"
d51ixs,"YTA

Not for lying to her, that was justified, but for knowingly leaving plastic trash at a beach. That is disgusting."
d51jaq,"NTA. Masturbation is normal and it is shown that men are far more visual than women when it comes to what turns them on. You shouldn't have been made to feel bad about that. However in future relationships, consider opening up the door to those conversations when you can. It's okay and encouraged to talk to your partner about what they consider cheating to be as it relates to porn, and be open about having conversations about what types of material you use to masturbate. Also consider keeping them on a private album, not to be secretive but to prevent anyone accidentally stumbling across them and not realizing it's jerk off material."
d51jx0,"YTA.  This kind of behavior is seen as normal for feminine people, and yet you're upset that people who identify as male are doing it as well.  That kind of double standard isn't cool - especially because you seem upset specifically because the one person involved is gay, and thus acting like this non existent ""threat"" is more than them just being affextionate."
d51llq,NTA. So it's fine if he gets the information from her via email but not text? I don't quite understand his reasoning here.
d51n5l,NTA you should explain to her about those that live in glass houses
d51ng1,NTA You did your very best to warn her about the dangers of alcohol. If she misinterpreted it it's not your fault.
d51nz3,NAH.  Friendships change and end.  It sounds like that's where you are at with these friends.  Concentrate on finding new friends who are more receptive to keeping in touch and doing things with you.
d51p76,"YTA if you punish the cat. Not for anything else. Please just take ownership of this innocent animal or rehome it. It’s effectively your cat now. There’s an assistance subreddit, go there, post an amazon wishlist and we will send you cat supplies."
d51p7s,"NTA but your boyfriend is. A parent plus loan should be paid for by the parents. It’s his choice to let this affect your futures. 

What else is he going to cave to her on? What you name your baby? Letting her live for free in your marital home? Cut loose a guy who is putting his mom before you."
d51rxu,This is pretty standard roommate stuff.  NTA for asking her to be mindful of you being asleep when she's getting up those days.
d51s0h,"You are the asshole. 

Also, your boyfriend is an asshole."
d51t98,YTA for making a deal you don't intend on honoring. NTA for wanting to keep your name. Guess my man gonna get to pee standing up!
d51ugi,"NAH: If you feel that you need to move for your own health (sleep deprivation) and your education, than you should absolutely do so.

That said, part of having roommates is learning to negotiate. I'm not saying what she was doing was completely appropriate, however it's also not fair to expect someone to make absolute no noise, or to hang out late if they don't have classes the next morning (IE: come home late, or wake up before you). They are allowed their space/noise levels as well, appropriately.

I am a light sleeper myself, so I get it... It's something you're going to have to learn to deal with. I suggest investing in some good ear plugs, or a sound machine."
d521ez,"NTA, not least because grown adults should be able to parallel park. How did they get a license? Can they not just practice?"
d523jg,"NAH - This one is really tough. I don't think it's wrong for you to feel hurt by his comment, but I also don't think it's wrong of him to express how he felt.  He clearly attempted to share your joy when he learned about it, so it's not vindictive or anything.  It could be a maturity thing, but it might not be."
d524yn,"NTA. Enough. She's totally TA. Hostile, problem-causing and out of her lane. Just drop her for good."
d526yt,"NTA; you are doing her a huge favor by taking care of the cats. You aren’t even in a relationship anymore and you are not only caring for them, but it sounds like you may also be providing for them financially? 

If you want her to become more communicative, you should let her know you absolutely are doing her a favor, and if she doesn’t change, she needs to come get her cats. It is common curtesy."
d5285v,"NTA.

> I was taught that if someone shows you hospitality, you leave the space as clean as/cleaner than when you found it.

Absolutely this. He showed no respect for your space, you're well within your rights to refuse him usage of it."
d52933,"NTA, you’re all adults here . You’re not supposed to be snooping and reporting on who’s banging who on a daily basis ."
d5293n,"NTA. 99% of times, when people pretend you need to cut off ties with someone they have split from, you should just ignore their immaturity."
d52frh,"There's a privacy setting on Facebook where you can block specific people from seeing your posts. Might be helpful, and will cause less drama than deleting them. They'll just think you never post anything on your page."
d52fxr,NTA. Your friend isn't really a good friend because she seems to expect you to emotionally cater to her by keeping your joy to yourself in areas of life where she's not experiencing the same kind of joy.
d52h0g,"NAH. I would say preventing your daughter from choking was more urgent than the possibility of crashing.

Cut your wife some slack though, it sounds like you were both freaked out."
d52h2z,"NTA it's a legitimate concern, and if he's hiding the results, it might be a valid concern"
d52hu4,"NAH

However I think you're being a little nitpicky. The struggles you listed are mainly internal, more to do with your self image rather than how you actually look. So she's not really aware of those and she just sees 'perfection' or how she would rather look.

Doesn't sound like she's saying anything malicious, just the typical reply to someone 'complaining' when they have nothing to complain about."
d52orn,"NAH - first and foremost, I feel like it’s disrespectful to honor only the people who are in the AF by asking them to wear their uniforms and then specifically ask you not to because you’re in a different branch of the military. Not to mention that your suit will be different anyway if you just get to wear a tux. On the other hand, while the bride seems unreasonable it is her wedding and if it’s going to make it go smoother for her, just wear the tux. Weddings are hard enough and stressful enough to plan. It’s better to be nice than right.

Edit: y’all I said it’s “her” wedding bc the OP paints the situation without how the groom feels, making it seem he respects his wife’s wishes or doesn’t have an opinion on it. Obviously there’s not enough info to tell, but I would have said “their” wedding if I felt that OP was including the groom in the conflict."
d52q0k,"NTA, but I don’t think you’d need to confront him. This is a fun thing you do and your leader is cool with your reason for not being there in character. Don’t be upset for going even though you couldn’t preform! If anything, I would just brush it off and chalk it up to J being over dramatic."
d52q90,Question: does the wife get any alone time?
d52rhn,"YTA

Assuming there's no other information of note to your story, the other person who **co-owned** the dog should 100% be the first person you contact if you need to give the dog away.  

In fact, it sound like he should probably have got both dogs in the first place."
d52u1i,"YTA 100000%. Holy shit, she double and triple checked with you to make sure you weren’t going to back out, I’m assuming because you have a history of doing things like this. You could have talked this decision through with her, but instead made your decision in secret and waited until only 2 weeks were left until the agreed upon move?? What is she supposed to do now? You don’t seem to care at all that her being essentially homeless is a direct result of your actions. I wouldn’t answer your calls either OP."
d52v1f,"NTA but would bear in mind weddings are super pricey and there may be a valid reason you didn't get an invite. 

Have an open conversation, not confrontation :)"
d52wf4,"NTA: You can invite anyone you'd like. Be prepared for some backlash though, not because you did anything wrong but because people are jealous that they weren't invited. Their jealousy is not your issue."
d52wu2,"NTA. You should probably just ghost this ""Abe"" guy, because it sounds like he doesn't respect your boundaries and isn't taking your ""hints."" Just tell him you're not interested in him that way."
d52yq0,NTA   Your BIL is TA and your husband is a huge man-baby who doesn't want to grow up and accept that life isn't one long fun trip.  You are not being controlling by making him cancel a secret trip your family can't afford when there is work that needs to be done so you can pay the bills.  He is treating you like you are his Mommy and he can go play while you do all the work.  What makes him even a bigger asshole is that he kept it secret.  You don't keep secrets like that in a marriage.  What was he going to do just leave you a note that he was jetting off for a fun va-cay while you did the work that paid the bills?  Hopefully this therapist can help him see why he is wrong on this issue and how he needs to grow up.

d534rt,"ESH: You both need to learn how to win, and lose, appropriately.

You aren't trying ""shock therapy"". It sounds like you're trying to annoy her on purpose. I'm not sure why you think this is going to work."
d5370w,"YTA and by the sound of it, a shite friend. A girl tries to be nice to you and you just assume it’s fake? Why should she have to change to fit int he group, if by the sound of it, you’re not making any effort to be accommodating, even if for your friends sake?"
d5388h,NTA- There’s gotta be a better place for him to talk and especially if it’s effecting you and your baby brother. He has to understand that
d53d6q,"NTA. Sounds like a very toxic group of girls who just expect everyone to bend over for them. While being a bit more diplomatic in your speech- or more even better, simply not saying anything and moving away- would’ve been a better option, this group beyond pushed their boundaries."
d53dnk,NAH because he is just imagining that plan and you are free to choose
d53eql,"NTA. It's really getting old hearing variations of ""dont tell me how to raise my child"". When you sit back and let your kid do whatever they want and it ends up negatively impacting other people due to your neglect, you cant expect nobody to say anything. On that note, it could have been said without the salty attitude, but you remained pretty civil and it was warranted."
d53lxg,"NAH. I live with multiple supervisors of competing and uncertain authority. It’s tricky, so to the extent I can offer some advice, I’d say it’s probably a bad idea to request one over the other. You should say it’s been unclear who you answer to and maybe make a very delicate suggestion about it, but generally you can’t choose your boss. It could get very uncomfortable for you if it doesn’t go your way and “Jim” finds out about your request. Play it real tight amigo."
d53nz6,"NTA. Jane was costing you your reputation and, even worse, stealing from the kids. Furthermore, it’s your bosses’ responsibility to confirm the suspicion before taking action. You did well by telling your bosses. Jane’s the asshole for not telling the bosses herself."
d53ov9,NTA - You don't have the money anyway even if you could help out. Easy answer.
d53p1s,"NTA. I live in Utah, polygamists aren't that uncommon around here. Polygamy sounds abusive in every way, at least how the FLDS do it, and this post has many of the reasons why. You don't owe him anything, he's your father by blood only.

And to be clear, my opinion here is on patriarchal polygamy, especially when run by religion. Polyamorous is a very different case."
d53rfb,"NAH. Sounds like you're polyamorous and your boyfriend is monogamous. I can see why he would be uncomfortable, though. He's within his right to be uncomfortable, but I really think you two should consider if you're actually compatible long-term or not."
d53sb7,"NAH

This is one natural outcome of friendships. All you have to do is stop making an effort. Most likely the friendship will die out on its own."
d53ul4,Definitely NTA WTF it should be your sister's own responsibility to manage herself. She needs to learn how to be more self-independent of herself especially for things like studying. Which is something almost everyone does them self. You've done more than enough for your sister she should do things herself now. She's in goddamn high school.
d53vy6,NTA. In my country it would even be fraud to do what they are suggesting.
d53xcf,"NTA - The way this woman went about finding your friend after only seeing photos of him is super creepy. If a man did this to a woman on a dating app his actions would be labeled creepy, because it's a weird thing to do."
d53xsd,"NTA

At least NTA as written.  In this story, you are so clearly and cleanly NTA that it makes me suspicious as to it's completeness and/or truthfulness."
d53yz0,"NTA - he’s probably at a loss for what to say and do, so he goes to your stepmom (the woman he’s closest with) for advice. he may have your best interests at heart, and most likely the attitude in which he tells her your issues is not in a gossipy tone, but more of an advice seeking way. 

your stepmom, however, sounds a lot like my mom, lol. i’ve learned that you can’t tell her anything, because she simply can’t understand that someone can be depressed for no reason at all. (“JuSt WoRk OuT Or SoMeThInG” -Mom)

perhaps seek professional counseling. it doesn’t hurt to try, and you can be completely assured that what you tell them won’t be relayed to anyone else."
d53z69,"NTA

But it is time you both talk to your respective people and clarify holidays and what you plan to do moving forward. You need to do this now.

IDK if you plan on having kids, but it will only make things worse when/if you do. 

She's his mother, so she needs to be dealt with by him. And none of that vague shit. He needs to be clear and direct. But before that, you both need to come to a solid compromise on this.

You are not nor will you be the last couple to encounter this holiday crap and it is best to hash it out sooner rather than later."

d54lzi,"NTA

Depression sucks (I would know) but you can't shit all over everyone else and make your problems theirs. She's barely working. She needs to take care of the majority of the chores. You still did some hard duty chores and she has the nerve to flip out on you. Is she seeing a therapist? If she's not working on her problems, then she's toxic and you don't need that in your life."
d54mzv,"NAH, but you should have a heart to heart with him ASAP."
d54oby,"YTA

>I think that its disrespectful

Any time you're convinced that your partner is disrespecting you over something you made up., you're probably the asshole. You go to bed and wake up at a time that's unreasonably early for a lot of adults; she shouldn't have to keep the same schedule as you in order to be your girlfriend."
d54ru9,"NTA with the huge caveat that it's only if you're being truthful about your sisters not doing shit. It seems a bit like an exaggeration, but then I have known people who grew up in households where some people had to do a lot more than others, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt.

And I took the ""women's work"" as more of a retort to show his mom the flaws in her logic than as a sincere statement. OP, if you were being serious though, get that out of your head. Having a dick (or not) doesn't make you any better or worse at mowing, washing dishes, etc."

You playing the game makes no difference to whether or not she will enjoy the game. Unless you're a spoiler or something. 

This whole ""if you do something then I cant do it"" is so weird. 

That being said: did you get her the switch, or did you get both of you the switch. If you meant both of you, then you really didnt get *her* a present so much as a household item.


Edit: changed to NAH. Not sure the BF is an asshole for playing a game while the GF isnt ariund, but the GF isnt an asshole for wishing he wouldn't. Shes flirting with asshole behavior by her reaction though, which strikes me as pretty close to ""I'm taking my ball and going home!"""

d55bpm,"NTA. I might get flack for this, but I think you did the right thing. A bunch of 16 year-olds with a lot of alcohol and 25+ cars? *Someone* was going to drive home drunk, probably many someones. 

I understand why your neighbor might be peeved, because it's not *directly* your business, but hot damn. Someone needed to take responsibility."
d55dd5,"NTA.  Never co-sign for loans for others.  If they can't get the loan based on their own income/credit, either they don't make enough to afford the payments, or their credit is bad because they don't pay their bills.

And if he's doing ""pay 4 years and turn it in"" - that's a lease, and if he (or you) turns the car in before the 4 years is up - he (and you) is still responsible for the remaining payments.  Cars don't hold their value, so it's pretty much guaranteed you will owe more than it's worth (and you are responsible for the difference)"

I'm so sorry about your parents, what a difficult time for all of you.

You're at the right age, but youre timing might be off. That being said, if you conceived today, you still have another 40 weeks to get geared up.

The caregiver brother is likely emotionally exhausted. So his reluctance to have a baby in the house is understandable.  Make it clear your expectations from him don't include childcare.

Ironically,  it sounds like your parents house needs a new baby in it, to wake everyone up to the joy of life.  (Sorry, got a little corny right there)."
d57sij,"NTA. But they would only contact you if both parents (all the other numbers they gave) are unreachable. It might even be that the forms required a certain number of different contacts and they couldn't think of anyone else.

d57tny,"YTA for quite a few reasons. 

1. He’s not a sperm bank, he’s a person that deserves to know if he fathers a child.

2. You keep assuming and giving us excuses as to why he wouldn’t want to be a parent but you don’t have the decency to give him the chance to make his own decision. You said it yourself that you don’t know a thing about him so how can you say that he wouldn’t want to be in his child’s life?

3. You’re not only taking away something from the guy but also from your child. What if your kid wants to know who their dad is and why he was never in the picture? Are you going to lie to them or tell them it’s because you never told their dad that they exist.

4. Bio dad’s info can be medically important! What if your child is sick and there can be a hereditary problem? This can help doctors treat or prevent. That’s why when you go to the doctor they have you fill out a chart and usually ask you questions about family medical history.

5. He might not want to be a dad. Your assumptions might be correct and he might freak out and want nothing to do with it. That’s always a very possible scenario and apparently the one you’re hoping for. If that’s the case then you can seek legal help and hopefully get his rights terminated based on what state you live in. At least it will be HIS choice and not a forced one. 

I would understand if you didn’t want to get him involved if you weren’t keeping the pregnancy, but you are. 
If you know his contact info I really suggest you give him a call. Telling him over the phone might be better since you don’t know this person or how they will react. This way you can avoid any dramatic or possibly violent behavior and then take it from there."

If you look over your rental agreement with the mall there will probably be a clause in there about not making the mall look bad, not being rude to customers, etc...

Bottom line, he’s got a disability. If you tell him to shut up, he’s going to feel AWFUL about himself. I understand it’s annoying. I have little patience so I’m sure I’d be annoyed, too, but you’ve gotta be a little more empathetic to his situation."

At this point, it's only a matter of months before your son is gone. The way things look, you will probably have minimal or no contact with him after he turns 18. 

You said he's an ""angry person."" That's a very unusual way to describe your child. Why is he angry? Does he have a right to be angry? Why is he not in therapy? 

You have a standing rule that he is not allowed to hang out with his friends at their house? Because they are unsupervised? At 17?? WTAF???? Do you expect him to magically grow a responsibility lobe on his brain on his 18th birthday? 

If you don't trust him to make good choices without you (or some other parent) hanging over his shoulder 24/7, then you've done a shit job of parenting. So....when you do let him off the chain, what the actual fuck do you expect? Of course, he's gonna go do exactly what you've been accusing him of doing. Even if he really doesn't want to do it. 

Then when you pick him up and he's drunk, do you wait for him to sober up and have a discussion? NO. You start in on him *while he's drunk*. What the actual fuck did you expect to happen? That he's gonna somehow pull patience, reasonableness, and responsibility outta his drunk ass? 

And you take his phone (which is okay if you paid for it, not okay if it was a Christmas/birthday gift or if someone else paid for it), and THEN...you go through the messages. Damn.... Invading the privacy of your 17yo son just because you want to. Really greaaat parenting there. THEN you get butthurt at the things you read. GROW THE FUCK UP!!!

Oh...and to just put the cherry on top of this shit cake (that you've created all by yourself), you've given him a ""get out of jail free"" call BUT this time **doesn't count** because the situation doesn't meet your standards for a ""party""?

Look, I agree with you about expensive weddings. I think $45,000 for a wedding is absolutely absurd and would push really hard against spending even half of that. But you discussed budget, came to an agreement where she spent a bit less and you spent a bit more than you imagined, and now you’re unilaterally deciding that you won’t hold up your end of the bargain because “she’ll be happier in the long run.” Marriage requires both compromise and respect, and going back on your word because you think your fiancée is a silly woman who doesn’t really know what she wants is neither of those things."

> I ended up buying her the game back for Christmas (might be an A for this one as she did not ask for it) even if she did not own a PS4. 

I think that makes you a double asshole. You should have bought and replaced her game immediately, or as soon as possible. Not give her back a game you owe her as a Christmas gift."
d5fhj0,"NAH.  Maybe you should ask your uncles if they're out, and then ask your friend if it would ""be a problem"" if they were gay?"
d5flyd,None of the backstory has anything to do with your question. It’s very common to switch off holidays to see the other side of the family for married couples when the families do not live close to one another. All you have to say is you are visiting your in-laws this year.
d5fm4r,"ESH

Your GF should have talked to you about it, just throwing it on you was the wrong way to go. 

That said, a lot of this could be solved with simple conversations, have the brother contribute to your grocery budget and let him know lights will have to go on downstairs when you need to work. If he doesn’t like it, he can move out. 

Your GF’s mom is already paying a lot of money to help support your household. Of course the brother isn’t paying to live there, his mother is footing half your rent."
d5fmzz,NTA you don't have to be friends with people you don't like. Her bad home life doesn't excuse this toxic behaviour

d5fukk,"NTA - at all. I have a coworker like this in my open office and she is sooooooooo exhausting. Like your experiences, she tells boring stories about her adult children and gives unnecessary play by plays. I just try and ignore her these days but wish I had the courage like you to tell her that."
d5fy8d,"YTA. You said yourself that 1) you don't walk the dog at the same time every day, and 2) you were sleeping. So what did you expect, for your mom to wake you up to let you know she was taking the dog based on the odd chance that you would get up and decide to walk the dog? Your mom doesn't have to inform you of all her day to day activities.

Also, regarding: 

>I have an anxiety disorder so it all just spirals into, ""what if my neighbor shot him?""

You have my sympathies... But again, it's not other people's job to tiptoe around you to avoid setting if your anxiety. Learn better coping skills, and stop blaming others."
d5g59i,NTA. I wouldn’t open a joint account with anyone until marriage.

d5ga16,NTA. Everyone has their own preferences. There is probably a time in her life where she didn’t like something someone else made.
d5gdlk,[deleted]
d5gfib,"No Assholes Here: Mixing business with family is usually a bad idea. They’re still employing both you and your BF, maybe they’d like to take a step back from that without outright asking you both to find other jobs.

The move is to find another gig (you and your BF), because salvaging the family dynamic is far more important than anything else. 

Do it with grace and class, give the proper notice, do it with love in your heart and without resentment (even if you are feeling a little salty about the reduction in hours)."
d5go6e,"YTA for sure. Someone trusted you with responsibility and you are getting power hungry. If they come back, it's their guild - that they built, and you are directly betraying their trust. There is no way around it, it's a dick move."
d5go8u,"In this situation, I am going to say YTA. You told him 'it was JUST like $200 anyway' that has to be a blow to his self-esteem because $200 sounds like A LOT to him. Plus it sounds like you're always treating him to things that he otherwise wouldn't be able to do and he sound grateful for it. You're a great friend for doing that but in this instance, you did come off to be a bit of an asshole. 

I feel like he was just trying to give you what he could and you kind rubbed it in his face and said it wasn't worth anything."
d5gvki,"YTA. Not for rehoming the puppy, that sounds like the best choice at this point, but for continuously making large decisions about pets without bothering to talk to your girlfriend. When you live with someone you don’t get to make unilateral decisions about stuff like that.

Honestly, this whole situation probably wouldn’t have even happened if you’d bothered to talk to your gf before you bought a dog."
d5h0ge,"NAH: It doesn't sound like she's being aggressive about the denials, but is just desperate. Is there anyone around that you're comfortable babysitting WITH?

I do think it's important to tackle this anxiety. Babies are wonderful, and it can be a really great way to start bonding with your niece. I understand the anxiety, and it's totally valid... But there's really only one way to move past it, and that's by facing it."
d5h1wq,"YTA: I'm really hesitant to write this, but I'm going with you're the asshole based on what you've written this post... It sounds like you have some really high expectations of him, and it isn't exactly fair.

You are **much** older than he is. He did not ask you to take on the motherly role, but you did. I'm sure he's incredibly grateful for this... But, if you're going to take on the motherly role, you need to accept that moms don't ask their kids for payback after essentially raising them. It's what moms do for their kids.

If he's struggling with school, and choosing a degree, maybe he's depressed. He's at the prime age for it. I'm 27 years old, and let me tell you... Life for our generation is *not* easy. I get the whole ""millennial are lazy"" nonsense, but seriously. It's fucking hard, and much harder than even when you were our age.

Your brother is not your babysitter. He's their uncle, and he should be allowed to be their uncle. 

Are you paying him for babysitting? It doesn't matter if he's family... It's work. If you can't afford a babysitter, I suspect you can't afford him either. Unfortunately, when you actually needed him, you probably used up all your ""free"" babysitting sessions that he was comfortable with before he started to feel used.

To summarize...

1) He does not owe you for what you did for him as a child. He was a child.

2) He is busy with school, and likely depressed and anxious due to his current life stage/age. You're already dismissing him not declaring a degree and deciding he isn't taking it seriously. He's probably depressed about this, just an FYI.

3) He is not your free babysitter. Rather than allowing him to be an uncle, you used him. Now, he's done being used."
d5h3be,"NTA - You didn't seek a supervisor out to complain about him, your supervisor asked you directly. You were being honest. It's sad that he won't have a job, but if he'd been making progress he might not have been let go."
d5h4sq,Info: why are you friends with her?
d5h916,"It feels like there are parts of the story we're not getting here.  Like, there's mention of a breakdown, and a lot of comments about ""I can accept blame for my part in what happened"", without details of what OP did.  Reading between the lines, it feels like there's some detail being left out that may partially explain or justify the cold reaction from the sister.  Regardless of it feeling that way, I'll still vote NTA for uninviting her from your wedding.  It's your day, and you can invite or not invite whomever you want."
d5he1k,"NAH. I mean, you’re sick and that sucks but that’s neither her fault nor her problem. And she probably also wants to sleep in her bed lol"
d5hexv,"NTA - I too, am not fond of my family, they're not bad people, i just don't have any interest in maintaining a relationship with them. Family are just people, they're not any more special than your neighbour or the guy that delivers your packages. Blood relation means anything you want it to mean, that could be everything or nothing, its completely your choice. 

Something my partner said that i've always resonated with. If they weren't your family, would you be friends with them?"
d5hfhl,"YTA: I'm so sorry that you're dealing with this, but your other friends deserve an explanation. You are ghosting them for something that has literally nothing to do with them.

I didn't want to write this verdict, but you really should be open with them. Or at least, say goodbye to them.

On a side note, because this is not relationship advice but you're asking for advice... Depending on how long this accusation has been going on for, you may just need to wait for it to cool down and for your friend to process everything. If possible, try to have one more sit down with them."
d5hgt0,"YTA 
You adults, you need to grow up and tell her how you’re feeling and you can do that in a way that isn’t soul crushing 
You’re essentially ghosting her and that isn’t cool at all think about how you’d feel if someone you considered a close friend treated you the same way 
If I thought 10 of my friends were my friends but actually they werent bro that would break my soul and I’d be insecure and self conscious for the rest of my damn life 
You need to be honest with her and tell her EVERYTHING but I cannot emphasise enough you must do it in a kind manner!!"
d5hhqi,NTA If your cat is cool on a leash and harness (which always makes me laugh when I see my neighbours walking their cats on them) then I don't see the issue. Maybe the dog owners need to have more control over theirs?
d5hi12,[removed]
d5hp38,"> My gf, on the other hand, feels that since we have been together for a while and since she helped with my earlier move, she is entitled to me asking on her behalf. 

Nta, I was gravitating toward nah but her insistence on asking your family and emotionally manipulating you puts a bad taste. If your gf wants to do tic-for-tac then offer to help her in conjunction with HER family or movers.

YOUR family helped because they were helping YOU. She should not expect free labor from YOUR family. Her expectation makes her an asshole - it’s one thing for her to request that you ask your family and let them make their own decision but her insistence that they should help makes her the asshole."
d5hsmr,"NTA. Jesus as someone who is online a lot, I know what you mean- he was in the wrong friend circle and his behavior was way out of the game."

I probably would have taken the bible, walked a few paces, then dropped it into a garbage can, but towards these sidewalk preachers I'm an asshole."
d5hwf4,"ESH. You certainly have the right to ask her to leave, but ultimately you are fostering several unhealthy relationships. Chances are your relationship with your friend is ruined and you may or may not be interfering with your ex’s marriage. It’s not healthy to be in love with someone who is married (even if their marriage is not great).

You and your friend should take some time apart."
d5i0hw,YTA - Please stop policing your exe's dating life.
d5i6n6,NTA but I feel as if this sounds unsafe for your siblings. They sound like borderline alcoholics and their kids are getting sick all the time. Is there anything you could possibly do? Maybe call CPS?
d5icem,"YTA because you know she hates it and cries. Let her take her time with it, and don't force it, because she may resent you in future for forcing her and making these memories unhappy ones. She may pick it back up in time, she may not."

d5il9q,NTA. There are laws about paying wages at least in the US. You agreed on a wage and it should be paid!
d5im7x,"YTA: I'm sure most would disagree with me, but this isn't your brother in law's fault if it's ruining your relationship... It's you and your husband's, because you two clearly are having issues communicating with each other. You two haven't talked in two days over an issue with *laundry*? There's clearly something deeper here.

His brother received permission to do laundry from your husband. Unless you are 100% sole owner of that home, and you do not want your husband to consider this his home as well, then your husband gets to give permission to his brother... Your husband lives there as well. It's home as well.

You need to work on communication with your husband and setting boundaries. I think fighting over him doing laundry at your house once a week is so not worth it... But hey, you choose your battles.

\*Edit: Thank you for the gold!!"

d5j154,"YTA for being mad.  When you give somebody something, unless you discuss there being strings attached, it means it is no longer yours.

Moral of the story:  loan things out vs. give them away if you expect them back."
d5j8cu,"NTA: The fact is, she put your life in danger knowingly, and you are absolutely allowed to bring that up.

Not only should you never get in a car with her again, you honestly should consider trying to convince your girlfriend of the same...

By the way, you are allowed to report reckless drivers. Honestly, if you're this mad about it, you could call the non emergency hotline, give them her plate #, and let them at least have it on record. They can't do anything because there's no evidence, but at least if she ever gets pulled over for something, they can definitely take stronger action because there was already a report.

This lady needs her license suspended."

d5jb7v,"YTA if you don't even try to find a compromise. Just because technically they're not barking during quiet hours doesn't mean your neighbors are wrong not to want to be woken up at dawn every morning by them.

Obviously the noise of your dogs stands out against the rest of the neighborhood noise if they felt compelled to leave you a note."
d5jcjg,"YTA. Bigtime. She legit needs big sister advice and you just laugh in her face? Not cool. Everyone likes different things, just because you're uncomfortable with it doesn't give you the right to be a dick. She needs her big sister and you should be there for her."

d5jhub,YTA not a big one but you are kinda blowing this out of proportion. You didn't get hit and worrying about all that stuff is dumb because it's completely irrelevant now. It's like tripping over and then having and argument with your bf bc he didn't appreciate the fact that you could have impaled your head on a spike and died.
d5ji21,"NTA Holly is 18 and bullying a 7 year old. That’s just cruel and if her parents stand by that then they support bullying too. They can’t force you to reinvite them to the wedding.  When is Holly supposed to learn to not be a rude and taunting brat? She’s now an adult and still never learned. There are consequences to being an asshole to children as an adult. Death affects everyone differently and your kid has a right to be sensitive and take her time to grieve. It’s not the place for sick jokes for Holly’s entertainment.

Edit: 

Holly’s parents seem to be blind to how bratty and cruel she is. So OP seems to have tried to highlight their blindness because of why they feel Holly is so “special” or “miraculous” to them.

Holly is known to the family as the miracle baby and apparently can do no wrong in their parents eyes.  I’m not sure just repeatedly bitching how bratty Holly is would have gotten the point across  either. It’s OPs wedding. She can disinvite rude family who make fun of her child being sad over their pet dying. If death is a funny joke to Holly and her parents they shouldn’t act all up in arms that their fertility can never be spoken of. They have a kid. It’s not like they never did and OP was making fun of them. They’re also in their 60s. So the ship has long sailed for them birthing any more children. Holly’s parents were not being made fun of over fertility like Holly was making fun of a pet dying while video taping of all things."
d5jkzf,NTA you live next to some weird people
d5jm45,"NTA. Even if the boss said it's cool, you should have been notified if you were going to be opening and the alarm was going to be off.

d5ko3y,NTA. But maybe you should talk about it with your boss? Tell your boss that you and your coworker are friends and that you would find it preferable if he knew that he was going to let be let go as soon as possible. That way your friend can make realistic future plans. If you put it like that towards your boss you would not be/look like an asshole to either.
d5kpjg,"NTA: Your mom handled this really poorly, and the fact that she keeps talking about it is incredibly inappropriate.

On a side now however: As a person who hates my photo be taken as well, and even more so when I was your age, you very well make regret not having more memories later with your mom and photos are the best way to keep them. I'm 27 years old, and freshman year of high school (when I was 14) feels so far away now... I have memories, but not a ton. I wish I was more involved, and had more photos of that time."
d5ksct,"NTA.  You’re not even given a schedule in advance and you’re worried about not fulfilling their expectations?

Halloween weddings are a thing and they can't help your son was born on that day.

Joking aside, its weird to take showers that long ESPECIALLY when there is only one bathroom for 5 bedrooms. She's 18, still not fully mature, probably just upset she doesn't have more room for herself but she needs to check herself because what she's doing isn't ok."
d5mu9m,"NTA. You are her friend, not her caregiver. She knew what type of assistance she needs, yet refuses to allow you to get a caregiver for the trip. Adding things you don’t know about her needs at the last minute is so inappropriate.

Edit: my last sentence did not make sense 

And - She should have been straight from the beginning, unless she is deteriorating and now needs more help, in which point she should consult her doctor before going on a trip."

d5mwop,NAH you both have valid points.  You have to figure out together what works for your family.  But you also will have to sleep at some point.
d5n2pa,"NTA 

Get out nowwww"
d5n79f,"NTA. Life happens. You got a last minute offer, early in the day when it's cooler, and you took it. No further explanation needed."
d5n7b8,NTA. Under 18 is still considered child porn and this could end up biting you in the butt. Hurt feelings are better than jail time.
d5n8fb,"YTA. Airlines offer plenty of movies for watching that are not child appropriate. That doesn’t mean that doesn’t sitting in an aisle with a child shouldn’t watch them. It’s the parents’ job to parent, not your brother’s."
d5n90q,"NAH. You already got her several gifts. 

But, if you want to be polite in the future, try not to blow your load by sending everything to her door weeks ahead of time. Just show up with the gifts."
d5nazg,"NAH - But maybe don’t tell the relative! I think they’d be pretty offended, honestly."
d5neo8,NAH it wasn't intentional.
d5nj2z,NTA. Hell naw. If they tried that at a regular gym they'd be kicked out
d5nmls,NTA He probably couldn’t make eye contact because he didn’t want to escalate the situation. As an employee I never took sides in customer disputes because it could end very poorly. He might have been embarrassed by the attention but I can’t stand people who think they can say whatever they want because “customer service.”
d5np1x,ESH. You're really going to be mad at your girlfriend for finding a picture of her while you were looking at other girls? Get real. If her posting a faceless picture is considered cheating to you how is looking at pictures of other girls not?
d5ntav,"NTA. She's being ridiculous. She can either sit in the laundry and keep feeding the machine or she can lose the dryer.  

You're not her employee or maid."
d5nvqt,"YTA

You’re not actually a friend. A friend maybe has a laugh about it, but when he’s asked to stop, he stopped.

You said it’s your right and you’re gonna keep doing it. You’re not his friend."
d5nxpa," NTA

I am also from Toronto, but this happened visiting LA. A self promoting rapper was standing on a corner and shoved a CD in my hand, l walked away and he’s like “5 bucks”. You put it in my hand dumbass."
d5o63i,"NAH. As an American and someone who has dated Canadians, it’s pretty standard for the men to pay for the first date. Unless women insist on splitting. You also said goodbye so.... she didn’t run. You’ve already said you weren’t interested in a second date. You’d *would be* an asshole to tell her off. You should have discussed that before saying goodbye and using the bathroom."
d5o7eg,"NTA. Your mother wants to help, that's nice. She can deal with the fallout. Not your burden."
d5oa2a,"NTA.  Their logic is stupid.  The price for food should be computed per person in any normal scenario, which this is.

There were 5 people, each person's share is 1/5 of $150 or $30.

If the dudes are covering their wives, THEY should cover their wives and pay $60 each. Duh?

Your friends are being dumb, selfish, or both in this situation."
d5oifc,"I think as long as you recommendations are in line with a Doctor’s you are fine. But I also think you should recommend that she trust her doctor more. Because you are right, some of your info could be faulty or outdated even if you do try to research. But if your sister only listens to you then idk what to say. Do your best. NAH"
d5oj9m,"YTA

This is your sister's wedding & you're holding a grudge over a silly comment someone else made years ago? Let it go, already."
d5oxxq,"INFO 

I really have no idea what you're talking about."
d5oy5c,"ESH - You had your chance to say no when he literally asked you. It sounds like you were dropping hints the entire time rather than saying “I do not want him over, please tell him not today or go over to his place. I’m very sick and need my rest.”

But it also sounds like you dropped a LOT of hints. I think he should’ve got the gist from you that it was a bad idea. At the same time - he was probably looking forward to his friend coming over and had “tunnel vision” after he heard that “yes.” But still - he should’ve known from the get-go that having a friend over in a STUDIO apartment around someone that is sick wasn’t a good idea, no matter what."
d5p2mc,"NTA - your ""opinions"" aren't getting in the way of your friendship, her shitty boyfriend is."
d5p3o4,"This is hilarious, you’re not the asshole!"
d5p5ox,"YTA You have no right, legal or moral, to kick someone out of their own home because you don't like them. She is not your guest. Her right to be there is not dependent on your whims."
d5p64b,YTA. Literally everyone has to make an effort to remember what people in their lives have going on. Just put in a minimal amount of effort pal
d5p6r0,"I think tomorrow I will be the asshole and park further up so he can't get his van in front of me at all. Then when he knocks my door ill let him know that if he boxes me in again that I will park there every day. I don't mind giving a little to keep the peace but it's ridiculous, they take up most of the damn street"
d5p8mg,[deleted]
d5pamb,It doesnt matter he was using it. Hes right theres a perfectly good desktop to use. If she got mad it meant she was gonna use it for some other reason
d5pds4,"NTA. Why are you even in communication with this person? If they’re racist towards you, do you expect them to suddenly become a nice person? Ignore them, and this won’t be an issue."
d5ph9t,"NTA

She makes no sense. Don’t worry about it."
d5pi3b,NTA as long as you can let your friend know not to expect the extra guest.  Be prepared for relations to not be friendly anymore if you guys were getting along post break up until now
d5pj5o,"Oof, YTA. There’s a massive difference between sexually charged humor and joking about sexual assault. I’m not surprised he blocked you without wanting to hear any more from you. I think it’s best to just learn from this incident and move on- if you see him in person at these events you might have another opportunity to apologize. Otherwise, things like this do happen. Sometimes we say awful/cringy things that we regret. Even if he doesn’t want to speak to you anymore, you can still grow and start fresh with other people."
d5pme3,[deleted]
d5pp0o,I don’t think she’s using the word ‘trauma’ correctly.
d5pr7k,"NAH  
  
Get a necklace to put it on or one of those silicone rings to wear while you lift."
d5prnj,"I was thinking no A here, but then I got to the part where you got angry and accused her of lying. Procrastinating isn't lying.

You sound a bit volatile, not to mention controlling. I think YTA."
d5pshm,"NTA. She’s badly informed, refuses to listen to science or reasoning and refuses to investigate further. 

If she refuses, then she gets cut off. Do not let her expose your family to illness. She obviously doesn’t care enough about them to protect them."
d5psl2,"NTA, bad teeth can screw you up for life. Yeah, baby teeth fall out, but habits are frequently forever."
d5py3u,"NAH 
Your doing something that you like, and possibly love. What happened to your dad was a accident, and could have happened to anyone. Granted, it could happen to you and I get why your mother is concerned. But I think that you should follow what you love, but be careful while doing it. Also, bloody Aussies! Much love/hate from NZ"
d5pzzd,"NTA

it's hard to fathom how your parents could take this personally. You are totally in the right here. They are called boundaries and in healthy relationships they are honored."
d5q0vt,"NTA

Her crush. Her friends. On the complete opposite side of the city from anything actually convenient to you or your friends. No. This party is for her, not you. 

Hold your own party and definitely invite her."
d5q1ta,"Daycare placements aren't always something you can get last minute. If they take the kid out now, then when she finds a job it could be weeks before they can actually get the kid a spot. Taking a kid out of daycare during a short term employment gap isn't always a good idea if you can afford to keep them in. You could potentially lose out on opportunities if you can't start a new position right away. 

It's only been six weeks, that's not really very long for a professional job search."
d5q5e3,"NTA. It’s a shitty feeling only being told that you look nice when you have a bunch of products on your face making you look less like yourself.

You shouldn’t have to put up with judgmental and back-handed comments—and that’s absolutely not a “mom thing.” It’s a mean thing. 

Your husband is also being an asshole for not supporting you in this. He’s being ridiculous saying that you hate his family when it sounds like you’ve only expressed how upset you are about this with him."
d5qc85,"NTA you were protecting the closeted sibling at the table, and to be honest I don't think there are situations where calling out homophobia is an asshole move. More people need to speak up and/or scream at homophobes."
d5qdor,I really hope it’s Snugglebottom.
d5qhn6,"NTA. By her logic, if she was hosting she'd have to make an all vegan meal, right? Pretty sure that wouldn't ever happen. You're being kind enough letting her family live with you.

(Also, why the hell would anyone *want* meat cooked by a vegan? I haven't eaten it in 20+ years, do you think I have any idea how to make it well?)"
d5qjcy,"NTA- your acquaintance is being ridiculous. Half hour or more a day is way too much. Once a week is much more reasonable, and if she can’t deal with that, that’s too bad. You’ve got stuff to do, you’re busy, and if you want to do well you gotta cut out the things that stress you."
d5qkqv,"YTA - it would have taken you 5 minutes and getting a bit wet 🤷‍♀️ you weren't refusing to help the chicken, you were refusing to help your wife."
d5qlju,"NTA. Your mom is the one who violated a house rule, not you."
d5qq9a,"NAH, but it would probably be good for him to get used to other people looking after him, and for you to get used to that, too. You might not always be able to do it yourself."
d5qya1,"....ESH but really it's your boss who is TA.  Listen, report your boss to the appropriate labor board so that you can get your rest breaks.

The reason you're TA too is because you're putting this on your coworkers and not even taking the break that you're saying you're trying to get.  The rest break is supposed to be separate from the meal break, not combined into 1 long break that messes with them.  If you want to start enforcing your rights, take your rest break as a separate break and tell your boss to shove it when they give you shit about it, and encourage your coworkers to do the same.  Then everyone is equal and getting what they deserve.  Don't just screw them over by taking an extra long lunch."
d5r038,YTA. A smart person would have known what a stupid thing to say that was.
d5r6av,"NTA, I'm so sorry your dad is my dad's soulmate. Don't ever let him gaslight you into thinking you're unreasonable for wanting space and privacy. Pythons kill their prey by incrementally tightening every time you exhale, and so does this kind of father."
d5r78r,YTA - why is this your business to solve or get involved with?
d5r7dd,"ESH, but understandable.

Honestly though, if you're getting his bills I wouldn't be in AITA. I'd be going to r/legaladvice. It sounds like you need a lawyer."
d5r9xj,"NTA. Chronic pain is no joke. If her response is to handle pain as everyone else does, then just cut ties with her; she should just learn to handle the pain of separation as everyone else does."
d5rd3u,"I'd say make it clear that this invite is for her alone and I'd say NTA. Because most weddings have the implied +1 rule and it'd suck for him to show up at the wedding either have it be weird, but its your day. If you wanted to invite specific brothers you'd be fine, but once someone is there you've gotta be hospitable."
d5rea7,"NTA - I'm high functioning and sometimes we just need to be told, no this is not the right time at all. Directness can help."
d5rekx,"YTA.

I really think you need to seek out some therapy. Miscarriages are hard and no doubt you've been blaming yourself for years over them due to your health issues. Now a doctor has given you a target for you to blame and you've latched onto it wholeheartedly. And I get it. For the first time in who knows how long it's not ""your fault"". 

But two things really stand out. One, how you're handling things. You've found your target for your anger and all that pain and resentment is flashing to the surface. You pretended to call a funeral home to try and guilt your husband, for crying out loud. Because he's not jumping at throwing out his companion on the word of a doctor who has done literally nothing but talk to you and given you, possibly misguided, hope. 


Two, Reproductive Immunology is still a very poorly explored and understood medical specialism. Any doctor who says, ""Yep, *that's* the cause, right there!"" with little more than a consult is already suspect in my experience, and combined with its newness and already developing reputation as poor science, it makes me even more skeptical. I linked an article in another reply. Please read it."
d5rfot,NAH. You are not obligated to drive her. Her husband can figure something out for her. Be nice about it though.
d5rl75,"I’m going to say NAH. 
Have you ever hosted a guest before? Like... ever? You don’t ask guests to help clean up or contribute “to the running of the house”, MIL or not. That’s just plain rude.

However, yea, it’s extra work and tiresome. 3 weeks is a long stay. In my personal opinion, I’d suck it up and just do it."
d5rroi,"NTA. Don’t wait and leave ASAP. That’s bullshit that he took her to work so she “wouldn’t have to be home”? That’s a red flag, I don’t care they’re newlyweds, that’s fucking bizarre. Not letting you two have alone time is really really weird... get out of there."
d5rsyr,"NTA, but you need to tell him it’s a hard no for you. It would be a bizarre and immature dealbreaker, but if it is one for him you need to find that out now. Don’t wait till he’s moved to be with you and you’re pregnant.

I find it obnoxious that he’s insisting on a name for your child before you’ve even thought seriously about having one. Hopefully he cares what you think in other areas of life."
d5rumd,"NTA..however, $25/year insurance on a $300 ring is a rip off. Look for a different policy. Add to your renters or home owners policy if possible if you have either. Most policy’s cover up to $300 in jewelry with no extra $ or policy addition. 

I know that’s not what your post was about, but that stuck out to me."
d5rwmw,"NTA they're responsible for their child and for the damage he causes. If they were renting and the child damaged something in the home, they'd have to pay for it. It sucks but it comes with having a child."
d5rx1h,Eh YTA. It's not like she's too young for your dad. Your dad himself is only 17 years older than you. You will eventually need to get over this.
d5rzqm,"NTA, maybe just a poor decision."
d5s0zy,"NTA. Your husband not religious and you have bad memories. The gift may have been a “Oh crap, I wasn’t even thinking.” Kind of gift. But at the same time, your MIL is also trying to shove religion down you and your husbands throat whilst also knowing both of your opinions and past. So at best, it’s an unfortunate accident; at worst, it’s a insensitive gift with malicious intent."
d5s1z9,"ESH. It's a dick move for drivers to block the intersection but, like with drivers, you shouldn't initiate unnecessary confrontations in traffic because that's just always a bad plan"
d5s2vg,NTA. A month is a suspiciously long time to ship something. You can pay them again if the samples arrive.
d5s3na,Banned for criticizing mods
d5s5g8,"NTA 

I mean it’s good to let a person vent for a little with their troubles. But at a certain point what’s done is done and complaining is just a waste of time or worse yet it’s annoying. Since you weren’t playing the game and since there was nothing pleasant to stay for you left and that’s perfectly fine.

One thing I say to complainers is “I hear you and sympathize with your situation, but what are you going to do about it?” 

You’ll find that just saying that cuts right through everything. Life is about what you do. Not about what’s been done to you. It’s about how you respond. 

Either the person realizes that complaining is over and it’s time to start coming up with positive solutions or they get annoyed with you and you don’t have to deal with their negativity too long anyway since they’ll just paint you as uncaring in their mind and not want to spend time with you.

Let me be clear this will only serve to make positive people respect you and enjoy how you’re always making them see their own agency in life and also it will make negative people dislike you. And you don’t necessarily want negative people to like you. But they will all respect you."
d5s6im,YTA. Dude. You live in an earthquake prone area and you left a wheelbarrow full of rocks on a hill leading towards your neighbor’s house. This is about as much your fault as if you’d thrown them through the window.
d5scdw,Some people aren’t ok with certain things. I have some friends who won’t watch anything even vaguely associated with horror movies even though they are 30-40. I would defer to you to know how your family would feel about this but you seem to have a very casual attitude about it and I think I have to go YTA without more information because you convinced them to go see it and even though they clearly did not enjoy it you don’t seem to take responsibility for them seeing it.
d5sg9f,YTA for lying.  If he has slept with 40 then he would be a hypocrite if he didnt accept your 23.
d5sjr9,"Please seek legal counsel immediately to protect your children. They are old enough to decide if they want to see their father and you need to help them legally.

ETA: NTA for obeying your sons’ wishes"
d5slr2,YTA. The problem is it attracts wildlife to the road side which means more animals get hit by cars.
d5spnu,NTA. What the fuck? He doesn't own you. You work for him *once* a week! You are allowed to take other jobs! Jfc.
d5sq7g,"Lmao ""she said I was not a responsible adult and unfollowed me on instagram"""
d5sy6q,"NTA, but I think you probably already know that."
d5t051,NTA but you definitely should have made this agreement explicit to everyone in the group.
d5t0ir,NAH. Your fiancé should invite her to the stag party instead.
d5t0qc,ESH use communication. He is being rude but you have all the knowledge to know he doesn’t realize that. So yeah he is an asshole. But do you want to be right or do you want to get what you want?
d5t1e1,"NTA. As far as being a professional, making a joke about it - single most professional thing you could have done."
d5t1x1,"YTA for lying on Reddit about a fake allergy. Your symptoms are in no way associated with an avocado allergy. 

Shit post."
d5t24w,"NTA

I don't believe in calling dibs on names. That's ridiculous.

No one owns a frickin name. And if they love it so much, they can still name their future child that hadn't even been conceived yet that.

Also. For the future, stop discussing names with anyone period. Because then this likely would never have happened bc it could've been as easy as oh, I did not know you wanted to use that name. 

The other details of your relationship to me, aren't relevant.

The bottom line imo is that no one owns a name. The only time I think you can be like okay, maybe don't do that is if it was like, his name was John Smith III and you randomly decide you want to name your child John Smith IV just for funsies"
d5t2da,"NAH Living with someone is really hard. You need to sit down and both work out a compromise so that both of you feel comfortable with the living conditions. You should be prepared to BOTH make compromises. If this goes very badly, and you're very unhappy with the situation, seek support from the floor/building support person."
d5t3im,"NAH. It’s hard sometimes, but letting your job abuse you can get out of control. Everyone has a life and wants days off for self care and just whatever. You shouldn’t feel bad if you just can’t or just don’t want to do it."
d5t75c,"NTA

Your friend pushed the relationship farther than it could go and you did what was in your best interest by ending it. Her loss."
d5t9id,"NTA  
Smartphones are the standard nowadays. Senior citizens who can't figure out how to get them to work use flip phones. You might as well be using a walkie-talkie.  
There is no way to do what your parents are asking you to do in order to ""earn"" this phone. As you pointed out, the school you go to has high standards. I wouldn't expect an average High School student to take on that many responsibilities and still keep her room spotless, care for dogs, etc.   
Your parents are asking too much.

Edit: spelling"
d5tc1l,"YTA. Especially if your friend doesn’t participate in the trash talking. Your friend doesn’t like it and expressed so. Continuing to do so makes you a bully, and all of your other friends for that matter.

Edit: reread the post and if he does participate then NTA, gotta be able to take it if you dish it out."
d5tdxd,ESH but you're the asshole we need.
d5tgvd,"NTA. Your mother said you should set it aside to be more responsible, meaning saving it. The fact she turned it around into a new rent payment is kind of buildshit in itself. If they wanted more from you, they should confront you about it, not trick you out of your money."
d5tl5k,NTA. How old are you? I am just wondering why you are still in contact with your mother. Obviously a relationship with her is not in your best interest.
d5tn19,"NAH, you obviously didn't mean to speak her like you're talking to a dog and it can be hard to know how to interact with disabilities. Your aunt got understandably angry though.

maybe ask your aunt how you should interact with her? (this could potentially come off the wrong way so make sure she knows you mean well). tell her you'd like to know for future reference."
d5tw1g,YTA.  Kids are not a thing you should EVER hide from a partner.  Your ex is a prick for putting you in that situation though.
d5u94p,"YTA for sure.  Not only is it extremely bad manners, it kills the grass and stinks.   I had to spend a lot of money putting up a fence to stop this behaviour from rude dog owners."
d5u97n,"NTA. I think you should continue to do homework, however, you need to somehow show your mother (maybe through studies you could find online) how harmful being brought up with no privacy like that can be to a child's mental health. It takes a negative toll."
d5ub4b,"NTA.  If she is rude to you and causes problems, why would you want to spend extra time with her?..... Exactly, you wouldn't. Dont feel bad or guilty for wanting to have a good time with friends and the girl you want to get to know better.

Also, she overheard the convo, so she invited herself, which is a huge no."

d5uo9j,"ESH


You're both acting like children, (probably because you are children, by the sounds of it). Your joke was stupid and I can see why it might have made him feel bullied. He sucks for obvious reasons."
d5urbs,"YTA - it’s a vape, not crack. What’s the big deal exactly? You seem very dramatic."
d5uu7t,"NTA, your dad is a shit and your mom is an enabeler.
That interaction made my skin crawl.

Mom :""its a shame she's crying since its her graduation""

Dad:""dont you fucking blame that on me""

You should check out r/raisedbynarcissists
They sound like they fit right in. 

YNTA, and i'm happy you have a boyfriend as wonderful as this.

Congratulations on graduating op! Time to move the hell away from these leaking sphincters."
d5uu9d,"NTA. Giving gifts does not confer ownership.  It sounds like he's trying to buy a guilt rope around you.  He's going to learn sooner or later this doesn't usually work, might as well be with you."
d5uuha,NTA Sacrifice a goat at her funeral.
d5uvoa,"YTA


She's seven. Even though she asked for your opinion, I think it's stupid not to moderate it considering that she's *seven*.


Her parents are the ones organising this, not her, and all you've done is make her feel like all her classmates will think she's a greedy-present grabber. If her parents had been the ones asking for your opinion and you said this, I wouldn't think twice about judging N_T_A, but she's a young kid!


She's seven ffs. It's your responsibility as her uncle/aunt to make her feel better and *less* weird, not worse, and not to 'tell it like it is'. 


You could have still given your opinion without potentially making her feel bad: *""It's certainly unusual, but it's going to be great fun!*"""
d5v1c9,YTA. That’s really insensitive of you and I think you should just scrap the tattoo idea. It’s like saying “ I only care about my LIVING nieces “. I know it’s not the intention but stil.
d5vbv7,"NTA, the hospital should be help accountable for their mistakes."
d5vgpc,"NTA. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it an actual health hazard (in a hospital specifically) to leave food out like that?

I'm used to NHS hospitals where there's a big emphasis on keeping everything as sterile as possible to avoid infections spreading and whatnot."
d5vkn5,"NTA going against the grain. I use the following sentence all the time on this sub- if someone is upset about something small, they are probably upset about something else. It sounds like you’ve got some self-esteem issues. I get it. Feeling like someone thinks I’m dumb or misunderstanding me is very upsetting to me. I’m not saying you’re crazy or anything, but therapy is good for everyone and has helped me with esteem issues specifically. Based on my history, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was someone in your past that made the joke and it stuck in your subconscious. Bark up that tree.

I specifically didn’t say no AH because I don’t like lame jokes, and that joke is just barely funnier than Jeff Dunham."
d5vl6n,"NTA. Do not “babysit” that kid again.  The fact that Mom wasn’t the least bit bothered that her son tried to kill your cat...you’re not an asshole, they are - the both of them."
d5vqif,"NTA. Before reading the last part I was ready to call you the asshole, because I expected you not wanting to pay anything and not taking responsibility at all. However, paying half is exactly how it should be. You were both at fault, so you share the costs. The guy that payed can get half of you and half of the guy (his brother) who tackled you. Give him the 20 bucks and tell him to sort out the rest with his brother."
d5vwn9,"NTA, but before you give them a solid yes/ no, it might be beneficial to let them know why you’re hesitant to say yes and see if there’s a compromise."
d5vxga,"NAH. You now learned that this can be an issue, so I suggest looking for affordable options to provide the animations in the future (possibly put together on a different device). There has got to be something open source out there nowadays?"
d5vyu6,"NAH You should still still him. But honestly, wait until the estate is settled. If it’s been 10 years since seeing him and 6 years since contacting, there’s no rush."
d5w11u,NTA honesty is the best policy. Especially when some fuckface is spreading lies to make themselves look good.
d5w2pf,"NTA, your car, your rules. And you didn't ask her to be insured for her car.
Talk with her about it but don't tell her she's a terrible driver, maybe tell her she needs to be more careful while driving, because you want her to be safe"
d5w3kl,"NTA

 Not really sure how you could be considered to be an asshole for doing this.

Are you more so concerned that the cost the couple is spending per plate will be burned on someone they don't know? Because, behaviorally I'm not really sure what the problem here would be."
d5w6mp,"NTA - sounds like your in-laws have zero respect for you in ANY situation, and this is just an extension of that.  Even if they are the grandparents, as the father what you say should be respected by them. Sounds like you and your wife are on the same page, so maybe she needs to have a chat with her parents and explain that it’s not okay for them to undermine what you say, but then listen when she says the exact same thing. They are acting like children who didn’t get their way."
d5w8wo,"NTA

But I'm also an author. Is it not possible to completely eliminate anything that might be identifiable as you too?"
d5waj8,YTA. If you were tied to the bathroom then you could have filled the tub and put the pants in to soak. Honestly the last thing I would do is put them outside. Of course they will get ruined that way.

d5xebt,"NTA. The manager is being deeply insensitive and compromising the safety of her workers. Most workers (especially women) wear a fake name on their tag to keep people from targeting and stalking them. Which is why it’s pretty much universally allowed. Tell your manager she’s compromising her workers’ safety. If she doesn’t get it after that, I’d let the other managers know what’s going on.

Not to mention that her reasoning is basically that she doesn’t want to bother learning her employees’ names, which is extremely entitled and offensive. She shouldn’t be a manager."
d5xf48,Esh he is right; you should never let out someone's room without asking.  But personal disputes don't absolve him from needing to pay bills.

The UK can generally have a really shitty attitude towards learning other languages. There's this idea that we shouldn't need to bother learning other languages because: *'everyone speaks English anyway'*, yet there are people that hear immigrants speaking their native language together and will shout at them to 'speak English'. 


I'm not saying that your neighbours *are* this kind of xenophobe with a double-standard, but it seems like common sense to just learn the language if you're going to live there. You shouldn't have to act as their personal translator because they're too lazy to learn something so important.

I'm glad you feel good about starting to stand up for yourself. Run with it. There's literally nothing to feel guilty about. 

Now it's time to sit down with her and have an adult conversation when you're both not so heated. Let her know that you're both clearly adapting to living with one another and that boundaries need to be set to avoid future problems.

Tell her you'll find a way to shift to take up only your 50% barring the food you share. Also set up a rule that dishes can't be left overnight. You're both busy. She can delay going to her boyfriend's place by 20 minutes."

>The school offers busing. But at $2,500/yr/child, it’s not affordable for us.

Found the reason they don't want you using other services!

Edit: $2,500 per kid per year, for 180 school days, assuming morning and afternoon service comes to about $7 per kid per trip. Assuming about 30-60 kids per bus that's $210-$420 per route. That's a lucrative business!"
d5xno5,"YTA- I don’t think you’re an asshole necessarily, but for all purposes of this post you are in the wrong. You need to inform HR about your living arrangements ASAP. I don’t think having a completely platonic living arrangement with a coworker who doesn’t directly report to you is a big deal, but by keeping it this huge secret makes it into a bigger deal than it is. And people WILL find out about it.
Also, if you all are splitting rent 50/50, then he has a right to allow his significant other to come over. If this is really that much of an issue, I’d recommend you find another living arrangement and someone else to take over your lease. Because it is unfair to your roommate."

YTA for coming to reddit and asking if you’re right or wrong about something that’s deeply upsetting for her and not just sitting down and having a conversation with her. Working on it to sell it faster? That’s not an appropriate response to the breakdown she had. That’s you focusing on the car and NOT your marriage. The car isn’t the point.

Go TALK to her and find out how she’s doing instead of categorically dismissing her as sullen and then doing what you want anyway. Does she actually want you to get rid of it? Or is she fine with you doing what you need to and also needs some comfort right now? Does she need to talk about her brother, who you clearly don’t know much about and haven’t asked about in the whole time you’ve been together?  Does she think you don’t give a shit about her loss or sadness and this is just another example of it? Was this type of car one of his favorites and that makes it even more painful? You don’t have any information because you aren’t TALKING TO YOUR WIFE and asking her about her grief, and her brother. That’s what makes YTA. Not because of keeping a car that reminds her of her brother’s death. It’s never that two dimensional with grief. 

Lean in, not away, dude, as fast as you can, before you end up with a bigger problem here."

d5ztoa,"YTA

Short answer, yes. 

That being said, it's not like I lack empathy for your situation. You're in a bit of a bind. You're choosing fear instead of your relationship. I don't even judge you for that. But if you're not strong enough to stand up to your parents in such a huge time of need for your SO, is he really that important? Probably not.

Maybe you should consider breaking it off with him or really anyone until you're in more of a position to stand up for yourself and the relationships you're in."

I'd say I know because I'm going through the same thing with my SO but I don't know all the details, I just know that it's draining to be around someone that has depression and having a relationship is difficult.

Thankfully, my SO understands this and she does what she can to talk about what she needs to but also share in common interests and hobbies without bringing it up.

You've done what you can and at this point it's up to your friend on how they will react."

d60dyh,"NTA, your friend is inconsiderate of your time and your feelings. I absolutely DESPISE people who are chronically late without good reason. It doesn't take much to be on time and to plan. Being all dressed and waiting for hours is the worst feeling and they should be more considerate. 

It's immature and rude to tell someone ""I will be there at x time"" and then intentionally throw that out the window and expect everyone else to be on your schedule. If they get offended, that's on them. They obviously don't care about how you may feel in these situations"
d60fd2,"I'd consider moving this to r/relationship_advice, you might get more appropriate feedback over there.

Talk!!! This (or something similar) ruined my relationship a week ago.

I was the one without the libido and she was fine with it. In reality I didn’t make enough effort and she wasn’t fine with it.

But please, for the love of god, talk about it! We’ve avoided the issue for too long and now..well..there is no relationship.

You will never be an A for changing how you feel. It’s just how you feel and therefore have the right to change your mind.


Of course there are feelings that can be controlled- agression, stress and so on. But this isn’t one of it.


Talk to him, explain, don’t let him shrug it off, make him to make time for sex. 

Sorry to be so blunt, but it just happened to me and I don’t want others to make the same mistake as we did.


Good luck."

1) It's a shitty gift.

2) It's statedly not for both of them

3) It looks like you didn't give a shit when picking out the gift, because you didn't. That's why you didn't realize you got them a gift only your dad can use."

It’s been discussed with her multiple times by multiple different people and she hasn’t done anything about. If anything she should be thanking you for cleaning since she obviously had no plans on doing it. I would agree that it does sound a bit like hoarding, and I do want to mention that that is a mental disorder and she may want to look into therapy. Having the house cleaned without her permission if she is a hoarder can cause intense distress and it sounds like it did. 

It sounds like what would benefit everyone involved is if she sought out some help to deal with this hoarding problem issue she’s having. However, if she’s not willing to take steps to help herself or you guys, then she is definitely the asshole."

Even small dogs need to be walked daily, or close to daily, even if you have a yard. They need mental stimulation and interaction with a range of different experiences. Being in the same yard every day is no different to us being in a big house all day. It's not great for us, not great for them.

They also adjust the table when you flip back to front and that takes another minute or two, and them putting warm wash clothes on your hands/feet.

d64xmh,"NTA, you told him about the problem and he didn’t take you seriously. Maybe you could’ve taken it to a shop to get it checked out but it’s partially his fault for not taking your concern seriously"
d64y73,"You're not wrong for being alarmed--that was a hugely dangerous thing she did.

YTA, though, because your reaction to hearing that your gf was in a dangerous situation is to be angry at her (??) and go straight to calling her a fucking idiot on the internet instead of being, idk, concerned. Revisit your priorities."
d653un,NTA but the customers who had blatant disrespect for the bathrooms at your work are the ones who ruined it for everyone else.
d654fg,"YTA.  If your daughter is ""killing it"" and getting straight As, one day out of school is not going to change that.  You're using this one day as an excuse to express your negative judgment of your ex.  It's petty and you're being an ass to try to cloak it in concern for your daughter."
d6595c,"NTA seriously 

You did exactly what I was going to tell you to do. Compromise and put it in the middle of your preferred temps. Now she’s the one being completely unreasonable. 

What is she wearing? Is she walking around in booty shorts complaining she’s cold? Or is she already wearing pants and a sweater? I get it. Get cold pretty easily. I also just put on slippers and a sweater because others like the house to be cooler. I sleep better like that anyway."
d65oen,NTA. If you have extra time at the end of lessons to do your homework then do it!
d65qlk,"You’re NTA, but neither is Katie. Ryan is. I understand why you would feel uncomfortable standing up at the wedding. And her email was... odd. But it’s her impending marriage, not yours. It’s her relationship. 

Is this the first time he’s cheated? Probably not. Did you do the right thing by telling her? Absolutely. Katie is a victim of Ryan’s cheating. I’m sure he’s very manipulative to get her to stay after all this. Blaming it on cold feet, really? 

That being said, I can see why she’d be very hurt that a lifelong friend would back out of the wedding. I would suck it up and stand up there with a smile. And then probably either get really drunk at the reception or dip out super early (or both!)."
d65ysb,"NTA if you were to go through with it.   If these were close friends, you might handle it a bit differently but since it's just a roommate and his gal, it's more like an act of kindness by an impartial Samaritan.   Sometimes getting called out like this can help a person understand that their actions carry consequence and perhaps even result in the perpetrator turning over a new leaf; infinitesimally improving humanity ftw."
d660i5,"NTA - Call Child Protection Services. What your parents are doing is Sexual Assault

>I remember my mom making baby voices and wanting to (and sometimes managing to) touch my grey/sexual area and slapping my butt.

This is terrible. THEY chose to have you, not the other way around. They should've raised you better or at least let you live in an adequate home."
d660ju,"Yes! 100% the part about not knowing if they're sick or disabled or something. 

A few years ago I was at my brother's graduation with my elderly grandparents and when the graduates walked in the people in front of us stood up. After a minute my grandfather, who had parts of both feet removed due to gangrene, asked them to sit down. They absolutely  FREAKED OUT. Acted like it was the most ridiculous request ever!

Moral of the story: You don't know why someone is sitting, try not to block their view."

d66ci8,"YTA for saying ""we would like to move forward in the process,"" when the original process was obviously over and done with months ago.

Didn't you previously tell her that you had hired someone else and that she didn't get the job?  If so, then you should have said that another position had opened up and you wanted to see if she might be interested."
d66dse,"NAH.

You would prefer to not be reminded of it all the time.

She would prefer you be safe."
d66it9,"I think this is a sign that you're complaining about your work too much. Your wife expressed herself terribly, but I will say this may be an ESH."
d66l6b,"ESH. Most people don't expect to be kicked out after 5 months. Unfortunately, you did specify that it could be at any time. You and friend really need to budget to save enough money that something like this doesn't interrupt other people's lives. Guess now you'll learn the hard way when you have to evict them."
d66omn,NTA. If they are commuting with you every day they should contribute to gas. It's common courtesy.
d66prw,YTA - That’s definitely only the parent or caretaker’s job. It is pretty rude to ask a total stranger’s toddler to say “please” first.

d67044,"NTA. If you really want to, tell him he has one last chance to treat you respectfully otherwise cut him. You don't need that crap. You don't owe him anything just because you've known him for years."
d671oo,"NTA for not supporting her car decision 

You are, however, not a great partner for focusing on the car and not outright telling her that you’re worried about financial imbalance in the relationship and are starting to have some resentment. 

If you modify this post a little, you can send it to her with an explanation that it’s NOT about the car (because it isn’t), it’s about your total financial picture and you feeling more burdened with your SHARED costs. You feel like she gets shiny, new things and you have to pick up the other costs (and might pick up these costs too). 

It’s might be to stop looking at it as “she makes 45k and I make 85k”, and to start looking at it as “we make 130k, how do we use our finances responsibly and split our shared costs fairly”. But that’s not for every partnership.

EDIT: and furthermore, it’s not JUST her decision anymore unless she chooses to start paying equal parts of household expenses and will cover the car on her own."
d672od,"YTA- she’s not giving up your time to go fuck other guys. She’s saving money and making herself available for work. Unless you’re going to start paying her bills, you’re being a huge needy asshole."
d677ti,"Sorry, but YTA. If you're getting the 250$ anyway, why should you care? It's your sister who is dating him, not you. You needn't be in love with someone who buys something from you. It's a matter of pure exchange of goods for cash, unless I'm missing something here."
d67bzu,NTA. Honestly your mom kind of sounds like the asshole.
d67ckd,"NTA. There is a spare room and someone needing it. Could you compromise? When your parents visit, you and your sis bunk together. When they aren’t there, you get privacy. Seems like a win-win to me."
d67d7a,"NTA.

She can refund the tickets for any reason, and she still thinks you're an asshole for cancelling when you *can't afford it?* She's definitely the asshole."
d67da9,"NTA -- at this point ... but would be if you give her place away based on what that guy wants. In fact, discrimination is at play here if you give her spot away due to her blindness (I'm assuming this is a public college). I believe you may have a responsibility to cater to her. And besides, isn't your club for those who are less active?

Since you're going, I'd recommend letting her come but hiking/camping with her; let the other part of the group do its thing. If she's down to trying something beyond smooth paths, help her out. Maybe another group member would be willing to join you two, too."
d67k6p,"First, you are putting the cart before the horse, she hasn't been fired yet, and if this is an isolated incident, she may not be fired.  Second, if you do allow her to stay with you, you may be inviting more problems than you realize.  You may end up with someone who never leaves, doesn't contribute financially even when they can, etc.  Being charitable does not mean putting yourself, your sanity, and your financial well being at risk.  NTA."
d67mmu,"NTA

Restaurant bathrooms are NOT for getting ready. Touching up make-up, sure. But getting ready from start to finish, absolutely not. Especially in a small bathroom. I worked in a restaurant when I was younger and there were times that I went out with friends after my shift. I would change in the stall and if I had to do a quick make-up touch up, I would do it at the sink. However, if a full make-up job was needed to be done, then I would either do it in my car or stop at home. Never perfume in the bathroom; outside in the parking lot, sure."
d67msv,"NTA.
The people who are going with YTA  are actually blowing my mind right now.

People need to make concessions in shared living situations, but you literally foresaw this problem and offered a preemptive solution which was turned down on several occasions..
It’s your god damn TV. Had he specifically mentioned that he was having friends over to watch your TV then you may have been TA for not letting him know that you intended on using it that night. 
With that said, I can’t help but feeling there isn’t enough info. They cussed you out after you offered another alternative? 

If everything you said is true then absolutely NTA imo."
d67pl4,"NTA. You quit and that meant going forward. 

She sounds like well you know."
d67qjg,"The thing that worries me is that your child’s mother is complaining about spending this time with them. It worries me how she may treat the child because of resentment of you being gone , while most mothers would be stoked, this one unfortunately seems selfish and possibly neglectful. 

If you think this will be an awful situation for your child then I wouldn’t go, doesn’t make you an asshole it just means to look at how this will effect your child, staying with a mother who doesn’t want them there. Your child comes first so really look at the situation NTA"
d67tde,"ESH.

She was being inconsiderate and rude, you were equally rude and OBVIOUSLY stealing her stop was a dick move.

d68551,NTA but you should stop apologizing for misunderstandings that are perfectly reasonable.
d68asz,"NTA. You're doing your boyfriend a favor by taking time off work and cashing out to go on a vacation with him for *his* friend's wedding. He needs to compromise on the locations. Anyway, why does the engaged friend want to hang out with his bros? Shouldn't he be focusing on his fiancee and honeymoon?"
d68cn4,"NTA. You gave a me a solid laugh. Marry who you want to, and don't settle for less."
d68d0h,NTA at all. My mom acts like that. But even then shed just wait for me to text her. Especially if I warned her about possibly being late.
d68dhs,"She doesn't want you to get high, because she'll get less attention..? NTA."
d68gfj,"NTA. This is just drama. You picked the girl cause they were being bitchy. Next time tho, just show up with her."
d68j9t,"NTA. It’s common courtesy not to do laundry at that time of night if it will wake people up, regardless of whether they have to come through your room or not (but having to come through there makes it worse). From what I understand, it’s common in apartment buildings and hotels to limit use of washing and drying facilities after certain hours so it doesn’t wake up the people that are in the rooms nearby. 

I’m not sure if you’re a guy or a girl either, but if you’re a girl, there’s the added factor that you’re entitled to privacy from another guy traipsing through your room, brother or not. Actually having written that, even if you were a guy you deserve privacy, and I didn’t mean otherwise. But what if you wanted to get a self-sesh in or sleep in the nude or something. You just have no privacy in the night."
d68lkq,"ESH because you two don't know how to communicate, argue, or discuss things like adults; it seems.

The correct response to ""responsible chores not completed to partner's satisfaction"" is not ""what were you doing all day"" or ""now I have to redo it, this doesn't even count"" and definitely not ""you don't care about us at all"".

Similarly, the correct response to all of that is not ""letting it slide for over a year"", or ""boil over until you retaliate in kind"".

You're the asshole because you picked at and festered this particular wound until it exploded, a serious asshole move.

She's the asshole because escalating issues with chores and reciprocity into not caring about your family is a borderline abusive move.

You two need therapy immediately because these issues aren't going to resolve themselves magically and you two aren't going to learn how to have sensible arguments without some help from a professional; in the interim there are kids in the house exposed to your poor argumentative strategies taking lessons on how relationships work."

If you find the answer to this riddle PLEASE TELL ME."
d68zlq,"NTA. She sounds kinda jealous but you’re his cousin. It’s not like anything was going to happen either way, and now he’s siding with her because he wants to keep up the relationship. She’s being rude and I don’t think you’re in the wrong for trying to tell her to cut that shit out.

FINE. I think I'll suck it up and go. Thank you, I think your comment, in a rather painful fashion, helped me to be a better person.

I think I'll send some rent money to my mom this month despite her insistence I don't need to do it cos she loves me so much. I'm too old to freeload"
d69f0f,"NAH-You do have a valid reason to hate him, but by a lot of tokens, the kids are the only piece of your ex-wife that he tangibly has left. He did lose a wife, grieving is not going some finite easy path.

But again, you have a valid reason to hate him. He’s not your friend, and he doesn’t have to be. 

I do have to ask, how has he worn out his welcome?"
d69fyb,"NTA. There’s no reason for him to be dishonest with you. And honestly it doesn’t make sense why he can’t take $20 out of the $100. Plus if he had his books and college paid by your parents already, it’s odd he needs another book he didn’t know about, which they can also foot the bill. The only reason you’re close to being TA is saying you would and then saying no, but it’s your decision."

d6acbj,NTA - I’ve worked retail for over ten years and I absolutely loathed people who demanded to be let in early or came in 5 minutes before closing and made me stay late . With that said if a customer is already there has been made aware of clothing time and is clearly not buying anymore and can easily leave at closing time it doesent bother me . In fact I would take great pleasure in telling them to gtfo when we were officially closed . Ya sometimes it’s annoying but it’s my job and working hours are there for a reason ; 9 minutes means you have 9 minutes . If she would have reminded you at the ten min mark and then with 2 min left that would have been cool but to come and remind you every single minute is VERY obnoxious. Don’t listen to the other people op . A person finishing their coffee or whatever without purchasing anymore in no way prevents them from closing up and cleaning up . But what Starbucks closes at 6?
d6aeg9,">He would protest going to straight bars with us and became a drama queen, kind of like a girl.

YTA. This line is one of the few times in this post where we see an authentic look into what your conversations with him are actually like and not the fabricated, biased version of events you try to put forward.

It is understandable not to want to engage with a drug addict. But that's not what seems to be the issue here."
d6ajt2,NTA. You don't need to refund your friend for a text book he willingly purchased. Not your responsibility to make sure he has the book he wants.
d6arfg,"NTA.

These aren't the actions of a friend.

If asked about it by management definitely don't lie, and be willing to give them your friends contact info.

Your position is he came and started bothering you, then did something stupid with some other people.

d6bde8,"NAH. You don’t want to do it out of maybe upsetting your mate, she has all the right to wear what she wants. I don’t think your grandparents are arseholes either, they grew up in an era where showing too much wasn’t the norm, and it was probably so ingrained into them that only slutty/dirty people wear skimpy clothing, so might feel uncomfortable around her. I say don’t ask, let her wear what she wants to wear, hope it’s half modest if it’s a proper fancy sit down meal, and if your grandparents say anything just calmly explain that she is her own person and can wear what she likes. That times have moved on and she is wearing something that might be considered more appropriate nowadays. For example I’m sure when your grandparents grew up, bathing suits etc didn’t have to cover there ankles, but people about 100 years ago would have thought that it was a terrible thing to not cover fully when at the beach etc."
d6bdoi,"NTA they suck for having incest. Cousin sucks for cheating on his gf, aunt sucks because she’s supposed to be mature and above this and for having an affair with a taken man.

YTA. Has it occurred to you to [edit: uncivil remark] and PROTECT your daughter from the racists you are supposedly so against? Anti racism isn't popular in ""the community"" when you define that as white people of a certain age and class. It never has been and never will be. Dr King's dream wasn't to ask politely for people to be ""not exactly liberal but okay"", then give up and abandon black people and their white partners to the wolves if they say no.

> furious at both her *and* me

[edit: This is ultimately an avoidant desire.] You and the other white moderates are the jewel in their crown; they need to win your complicity before they expand their empire. You are the oil in their tanks; your [edit: uncivil adjective] actions fuel their advance. Do ""your daughter"" a favor and tell her you've chosen not to be a dad to her because it might affect your little popularity contest. She deserves to know the truth. Jamal deserves to know you place your little neighborhood pecking order above his safety and freedom, too.

Let's hear from Dr. King about the white moderate:

Letter from Birmingham Jail (excerpt)

By Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., 16 April 1963

""First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.""

Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.""

You're not just ""not liberal"", OP. You are the enemy of [edit: antiracists]. [edit: uncivil suggestion.] Be a [edit: swearing should probably go too, given the tone] DAD. Get your [attitude] together before you get someone seriously hurt with your wishy-washy bull[crap]. Be part of the solution or get out of the way. And might I add, your parents are who Dr. King meant by ""White Citizen's Council-er"". How many black people did they attack at soda fountains and city halls? How many have they intimidated out of their neighborhood? Have you even asked? Ball's in your court, [TAH]."
d6ciii,"Very easily NTA. He is abusing your hospitality. You're good friends, and that's great, but that doesn't mean he has permission to take your car without your permission. Worse yet, drinking and smoking weed in it? Hell no. That puts *you* in a bad position if you ever get pulled over, the smell of weed is unbelievably hard to get out of a car. Everyone is going to think it's you. You are so very not in the wrong here, you're doing the right thing both by standing up to your friend and by preventing a drunk and/or high driver from being a menace on the road."
d6ck42,"NTA - unfortunately most people don’t care about something unless it impacts them directly. I think this is a clean, simple solution.

Why is he your friend if he’s a transphobic?"
d6cmve,"Nah, he knows you'll be busy. Sometimes you just want to sleep next to you partner. It will also be good practice for when you 2 start living together. There will be busy and stressful days, and figuring out how to navigate them together is smart.

Just make sure you don't feel guilty by ignoring him while you get work done. And just relax and hope he can pamper you on the little time you have at home!"

He on the other hand has shown that he isn’t willing to respect boundaries you set - thus making it well within your rights to just ghost that dude for safety reasons (which you didn‘t even do by the way, just keeping the boundary you explicitly stated, which is „let‘s stop talking here“)."

d6d5gc,"Definitely NTA. She sounds like a narcissist. If it's not about her, she's not interested. She needs to be the best at everything, she needs to have it worse than anyone else. Any and all evidence to the contrary is denied or ignored. I had a boyfriend like that a few years ago and it's goddamn infuriating."
d6dl15,"YTA. If you just want me to comment on your interactions between you and the friend who will not pick a side then I believe you are being an asshole. She isn't being morally ambiguous, shes remaining objectively neutral. Whatever has gone on between you and this other friend doesn't concern her and that's why she isn't picking sides. Her friendship with either of you is not determined by the drama unfolding between other people. She sounds like a good friend to me."

ESH because proper etiquette wasn't followed at all. Friends usually reach out and talk to each other when there are tough times.

YTA because you could've mended this gap and been a bigger person by talking to your friend about it instead of ignoring them in their time of need. Treat others as you want them to treat you. 

If your dad was in the hospital over the weekend and their mom was just admitted, their mom could have been having issues over the weekend as well. People miss social cues in texts or get occupied doing other things. Your friend may have just been dealing with their mom. Maybe your friend isn't as close as you think. The only way to find out would be to talk to them."

d6e552,"YTA if you dont help contribute, you were using her laptop and she trusted you with the care of it, and your negligence led to the incident occurring.  And hes offering to only make you pay 1/5th of the repair.  You should take that offer because I feel like you should owe more and hes giving you a pretty sweet deal on this one."
d6ea3y,NAH. Nothing wrong with coworker asking and nothing wrong with you declining.
d6ee8d,"ESH. 

Look, she definitely sucks for doing that, but also ... a kitchen in the bedroom?!! Wut?! The bedroom is a place for sleep and relaxation (and sex, obviously lol), not to have big electrical appliances like a fridge running or cooking splatter all over the wall or bacon grease in your sheets. Maybe that’s your thing, but yeah I wouldn’t be happy if my partner did that. Unless you live in a caravan where you don’t get much choice, but even then, caravans designed for living in for longer periods have separate areas. Longing for years for a kitchen in your bedroom kinda sounds like maybe there are some deep-seated issues there you might want to explore (not saying that in a mean way - I have issues surrounding food myself because of childhood yada yada).

She shouldn’t have thrown your stuff out the window though. That is a violent act. Maybe she was at wit’s end for other reasons too, I dunno, but yeah it’s not cool."
d6ee9w,"NTA.  All fees must be agreed to **before** any transaction.  If they failed to mention them, or spell it out on their site, they just got $25 worth of business advice.  They may keep them but I'd report them stolen and leave reviews online."
d6eebj,"NAH. You violated your lease (bad OP, don't do that). She reported you. She's violating her lease. You report her. There are no assholes here, as you were/are both violating your leases."
d6eh8p,Nta but you should all do it together. Combined front and all stay strong intervention style otherwise I doubt the point will get across and she'll just hate one of you and nothing will get done. It sounds like itll be confrontation regardless though
d6ehmo,"NAH.

Your father set you up for success. You want independence but you want to also see that hes not alone. 

Maybe look toward moving him out with you? A new country could give him some new thoughts and insights."
d6eiu3,NTA.  I’ve had friends become infatuated with their girlfriends to the point they become MIA for a good part of a year.  I don’t blame you for not wanting to go if your younger brother acts this way.
d6el3h,"NTA, just Kindly say ""I'm not into politics, can you please stop sending me these."" And if she gets upset or still does it, block her. Easy peasy."
d6elil,"NTA, getting your hair and makeup done for a wedding is pretty normal, formal or not. I've been to alot of weddings where guests got done up because they wanted to respect the event. If the Bride didn't feel the need to not get her hair and make-up professional done that's on her and her choice. She can't ask people to look ""less than"" her."
d6eov6,"Yta,
If he's trying to get on his feet and be positive then making 300 buck legally in a weekend was probably a achievement for him.

All you did was try to tear him down because your bitter your ""help"" hasn't been paid back in what you'd deem the proper way."
d6epcm,"YTA. What was the joke? ""Haha you just got done work and now you have no food because I'm inconsiderate!  Just kidding!"" Best case scenario, she goes from mad/sad to neutral because there actually was food. At no point could this ""joke"" have brought her any joy or positivity."
d6eqde,"NAH: You guys need to talk it out, I dont think his issue is actually about laundry and keys but more so a general sense of respect.  You are only getting the complaints he's giving you, which in a bubble seem like overreactions.  Some people are wired differently and feel like some things that while arent important to you, are important to them.  If hes letting you stay at his home, Id probably just add the key and be done with it."
d6eqjc,"YTA, but only because that is dangerous. God gave us middle fingers for a reason."
d6erhk,"NTA - a father is just as responsible for taking his child swimming as a mother, good grief."
d6evz9,"NAH- what your girlfriend is going through is personal, and you do not have to share it with your mom"
d6ez1f,"YTA. It's important for your cousin to have someone to talk to about these things, particularly as he's at an age where he's going to become more sexually active."
d6f07l,"NTA. This is between your mom and your dad.  You never asked to be in the middle of it. Tell your stepmom that you refuse to play messenger between anyone, and if she has a message for your mom she can send it herself."
d6f1ee,NTA... He didn’t buy the tickets for the agreed upon date so that should be his problem not yours
d6f3n3,"YTA: You didnt do dishes for whatever reason, it became enough of a problem they felt they needed to discuss it with you, and instead of facing the problem you asked for a month of alone time? They are trying to show that the problem they had with you is not enough to ruin a living situation over, where you are happily prepared to nuke it out of spite.  Just do your dishes and say hi to them dude, its not hard."
d6fd00,"NTA - she's your mother, you clearly care about her and want what's best for her.

As for her fiancee, he's don't nothing to give you reason to trust him so why should you, until he gives good reason to stick with your stance.

Your mum isn't being an asshole however it seems she's being very naive about the whole situation. Just make sure you're there for her when things go south as they surely will and try dissuade her from making any rash decisions or linking finances etc with him if she won't listen about not getting back with him."
d6fl3e,"NTA, in my opinion. How dare you not adhere to social and societal norms of cooking dinner for the man in your life, don’t you know men can’t cook and will starve without a woman?

Jkjkjk but seriously. Maybe start cooking together when he comes home? I know writing gets you in a solid groove, but making this a shared activity is a great way to unwind, talk, and interact. Maybe he starts cutting up ingredients while you finish a paragraph. That way the “burden” is shared and there no guilt either. Everyone cooks, everyone cleans, everyone dries and put away the pots and pans."
d6fli6,"I kind of think NAH, but I think you’re right. It feels like your friend is not understanding the continued seriousness of the problems with Lee because he hasn’t shared in them himself. Mentioning with him how you avoided inviting certain people to make sure he’ll be comfortable/happy could be helpful?"
d6flyp,Nta. What is he doing in a music class if it’s so overwhelming?
d6fnn1,NTA. Why on Earth are you with this man? He sounds completely useless and ignorant of your feelings. Is there actually anything positive about him?
d6fq5x,"YTA. She's a one year old. Developmentally, she doesn't comprehend what you are trying to do. She literally cannot understand. At all. You're supposed to give infants what they want. He's being a good dad. You are not the dad, and as a babysitter your job is to take care of the kids per the parents instructions. She is not ""thinking things out"". What she is learning is ""When I'm upset, no one will help me"". You could be fucking with her attachment."
d6fs93,"NTA. Shit happens. Kids don’t stay within gated areas, and it’s not like you got high and fell asleep. You were cleaning the space she also lives in."
d6fvz7,"YTA but I think it was unintentional.  It was thoughtless to schedule an event that so obviously excluded one of your daughter's close friends; it was also hugely unprofessional of this business not to make sure they had a range of products and skills.  When the mistake was made, your response was pretty callous - sounds like an oh, well, I didn't know - here's some nail polish now shut up.  This was a hurtful thing and you could have done more to help Sara feel included at the time and then proactively talked to her mom about the issue."
d6fx0v,NAH. Your family should keep a doctor diary. Whoever brings him to the appointments can write down a summary in the book. It also helps you remember what you need to do (if the doc recommends stretches or something).
d6fz34,"NTA lack of prior planning on his part, does not constitute an emergency on your part."
d6g62z,"NTA. We should call in our friends and family when they are being creepy like that. Even if it was a joke, sounds like it didn’t land. If someone said that to me I would correct them immediately. You’re not an asshole for letting someone know they were weird to say that - as long as you’re not a jerk about it."
d6g736,"NTA

You're an adult and you have the right to privacy about your body and your health. Full stop."
d6gchu,"NTA, I have no doubt that this person came from money. Someone who didn't, would know better than to risk running up a bill that's in their name!"
d6ge1s,YTA. The point of headphones is to make the noise audible only to you.
d6gex2,"NAH, but I would talk to your boyfriend first about it to get his input and then bring up your points to your current roommate. She might be willing to compromise considering the situation. If she does, then the three of you should come together and discuss it. Establish some hard boundaries in the beginning.

But if you dont want to live with her regardless, you wouldn't be an asshole"
d6gg5x,"[r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/)

There are children involved, so I would figure out how to deal with this legally. Your kids should not go to the shelter with their mentally ill mother."
d6gj2y,NAH its just life
d6gmof,"NTA. You bought a ticket and made plans after confirming with him that he was going. He's definitely being TA.

Honestly, this man does not want to be friends with you. Maybe he's trying to piss you off so that you end the friendship first. He's not acting like a friend. He's acting like someone who avoids confrontation and doesn't know how to tell you to leave him alone. You need better friends than that."
d6goau,"NAH, however to make sure you won't take away the attention from the bday girl, arrive a day early"
d6gue6,[deleted]
d6guo7,NTA- but make an effort to comfort your half sister as much as possible! Families are complicated and I totally get why you would not have wanted to see him
d6gv9i,"Eh.  NAH...you definitely did right by stopping the car...driving while upset and fighting isn't safe.  You also did right by driving as quickly as you were comfortable while still being safe.

The only reason I'm not calling her an asshole is because she was probably panicked and terrified for her mom, and that sort of stress makes people nuts sometimes.   She wasn't justified by any means, but its understandable and it seems like she's trying to reach out to apologize and make up.  In the cold light of day, knowing her mom is okay she probably realizes how out of line she was.

You're under no obligation to forgive her, but you might want to consider it anyway...or at least talking to her to get a read on whether she's remorseful."
d6gvgp,"NTA. He is not communicating with you and that is number one in a marriage. I'm glad you are seeking therapy because his behavior is awful. He should also seek help. 

Also, did you know anything about his need for porn? Did he hide an addiction from you?"
d6gxow,"NTA. She should've Ubered home especially acknowledging they had money to buy more beers. It's your couch and your house and you were doing them a favor. They had the privilege to stay at your place, not the right, and certainly not the right to mess it up when you specifically told them not to."
d6gzix,"Yes, YTA. Your gf is right that it's her roommate's home too and she can dress however she feels comfortable. Maybe take a look at why it matters to you instead of trying to police someone else's body in their home.

Edited to add I'm not replying to any more comments on this thread. Poll has closed. Even OP has edited to add that he understands he needs to work on his mindset. Maybe the rest of you who want to argue can follow his example."
d6gzks,"NTA. Y’all are married/inextricably financially linked and she isn’t paying her credit card bills while you are actively trying to improve your credit scores. That’s a pretty solid AH move on her part, even if it’s unintentional as she claims."
d6h1u0,"NTA - he was being annoying about your viewing party.  His style of watching TV is shared by many others, and he should feel free to make more friends and find a group who would love to do it that way."
d6h4gi,"YTA: if you’ve got multiple alarms going off that you can’t immediately shut off, without walking across the room.  First year flat mates have drama because you’ve typically lived a coddled life in your parents’ home.  Go to bed earlier so you can wake up early or on time. Oh, you’re a software engineer at uni?  Congratulations, but if you plan on having a job someday, you’ll have to be responsible."
d6h543,"I don't need to tell him what a shithead he is. I know it, and he knows it.   
Also, his drinking didn't really ruin my life. The whole 'being in jail up until 5th grade and being a lying deadbeat afterward' thing was what made my childhood generally shitty."
d6hayq,NAH. Why can't you go separately? You already had plans set with your family.
d6hc60,"YTA, it's been a week in a new country and she's making new friends. It's important that she spends time with these new friends so she actually has bonds with people besides you. Let her have fun in a new place and just ask that she call you at the end of the day/in the morning so she can tell you about it. If you're this insecure , consider breaking up because LDRs really only work when both people are very secure in the relationship."
d6he2u,"NTA, racists don't get the benefit of the doubt, and they don't get to judge anyone. You are doing the right thing."
d6hhb2,"Parents need to realize how the way they criticize their children's bodies can haunt them for years.  This kind of stuff can really mess you up and is very serious.

That being said, when the dramatic climax of the fight was:

  I LEGIT HAVEN’T TAKEN A SELFIE IN THREE WEEKS BECAUSE I HATE HOW IT LOOKS. 

There are just not enough words for how hard I rolled my eyes."
d6hiri,"NAH your grandmother is mentally ill, she can’t help her actions. However; you’re entitled to some resentment because of how she affects your living situation everyday."
d6hj8w,"NTA, but it seems like you could avoid a whole lot of office drama and bullshit, by just explained to her that she's the only hardcore country fan in the office. You don't need to be mean about it or make her feel stupid, just let her know that you try to make sure everyone has a say and you'll make sure some country is included in the rotation.

Honestly this whole thing sounds like it's passive aggressive and could be solved easily with a little bit of communication."
d6hk2i,"NTA - while trivial, you are TECHNICALLY correct.  The best kind of correct.

Editing to add: After thinking about it, it's not that trivial.  You have to take an extra step to access the restroom that women do not have to take.  And if there is no one at the desk to give you the key right that minute, you have to wait, and your job could run late as a result.  That's putting a unique burden on men working for this company, but not women.  And if the building contracted you to work there, they are obligated to provide a restroom."
d6hoem,NTA. Don’t tell SD shit anymore.
d6hopn,"YTA

> everyone seems to hate it, including my teachers. 

There's a time and place for PDA. A classroom is not it."
d6hpso,"Ahhh.  The land of impressions. I think unless one is practicing for standup it’s mostly assholish to make fun of another’s speech patterns. 

Would the friend have felt remorse and regret if it turned out the professor overheard the statement?

On the other hand, imitation is the highest form of flattery. I had a professor who looked like he was talking and holding a cigar in one hand and a bourbon in the other, minus those actual objects.  Did we make impressions of him. Yes!

So, yes it’s assholish, but it’s an assholish behavior that is socially accepted. Even so, it does not make you TA for bringing up that trying to imitate the accent poorly is in poor humor. 

NTA"
d6hqtn,"NTA, but maybe do a little less pearl clutching about her living with other men before their relationship started. Big yikes on your part."
d6htv2,"NTA- she should have let him out before bed. You guys need to agree that last one asleep takes him out as well as first one up. In the mornings, the rule in my house is that you let dogs out first before anything else."
d6hvsm,"NTA. 

Not like you were given any service. You’re not eating in. You’re not obligated to tip. 

The person ringing up your order was most likely being extra friendly in hopes that you might tip. The fact that her mood immediately dropped after not receiving one seems sucky. You’re supposed to be polite and friendly regardless of whether you’re being tipped or not—especially if you work in a customer service type role."
d6hxno,"NTA. You pay rent, you're a tenant. Legally he should give you 24 hr notice before he enters the premise. Coming from a relationship stand point though, parents usually have trouble with kids who establish boundaries. Give him some time. He'll get used to it eventually."
d6i1z4,So you’re leaving your wife with a 5 month old baby just as she’s starting a new job? Without warning? YTA imo
d6i6s9,"NTA. This is Classic Teen Behaviour, and both your request and your response to her refusal are reasonable and proportionate."
d6iegt,"NTA, who shows up to a kid's birthday party uninvited?"
d6ik4t,"NAH: You do whatever you need to do for the sake of you and your fiance.

That said, this proves that their fears are valid. You will not go this year, and then you'll remember next year that it was so much better without them and you'll skip again, etc... Eventually, you'll stop going altogether, and this may bleed into other events/holidays.

With time, your father's mood should improve. Perhaps you could be direct with him and let him know that you would like him to enjoy the holiday, and what can you do to help make that happen?"
d6ivt1,"YTA. While running mundane errands like getting gas, she might want to be treated like everyone else. It's extremely rude for you to comment on it as the gas station attendant.  It's no different from commenting on another woman's breasts, or someone's artificial leg.

> Just wanted to let her know that I didn't mind at all.

It's not for you to ""mind"" anything. Your approval is not needed. Your opinion is irrelevant.  Just work the gas pump and keep your comments to yourself."
d6ixm7,"NAH.

You gave her permission to do what she's doing so she's not an asshole.

You're also not an asshole for rescinding that permission"
d6izds,"NTA. Imagine it this way: your roommates know you don't like fish. They eat fish occasionally, and the microwave starts to stink of it. You find out you're allergic to fish and the smell of it could cause you to be physically miserable for hours. Your roommates still make fish.

Would you still think you're a bad person for moving?"
d6ize2,NTA. You guys had an arrangement and she broke it. Plain and simple you had every right to take the phone back and now you dont have to worry about negative repercussions from missing payments.
d6j0rd,"NTA. Your child, your choice. Your mom hasn’t made much of an effort to be in your life, so why should you make the effort now? You have every right to be hesitant about having a relationship with her."
d6j2z3,NTA your wife sitting there insinuating that your SIL is bulimic is fucked up and completely inappropriate.
d6j63z,NTA - Driving safe is important. That other mom would have saved more time if she just got a different spot in the first place.
d6jc2k,NTA - Your dad has some serious boundary issues. Set some new boundaries and make sure you stick to them. Do not give an inch.
d6jc88,"NTA

Morgan sounds like she is terrible for Jack. She is not just anybody that Jack is datiing, she is a known asshole."
d6jdlo,NTA. Perhaps another retail type job would be better that saying you work at a diner.
d6jdxi,"I mean, you’re a millennial?"
d6jeaw,NTA you live 2 hours away. I mean you will spend more on travel than they would on a babysitter.
d6jhyu,"NTA: here’s why:

You have full custody

Court agreement every other weekend, 2 weeks summer


That’s it. Anything extra is pure kindness. You don’t owe them anything besides that."
d6ji8u,"YTA. This isn't your company, this isn't you doing your job, this is just you wanting to put your nose in where it doesn't belong because you think he's getting special treatment."
d6jiuy,NTA. Get over there ASAP because she sounds shady as hell
d6jnhl,"NAH

I can see why people would feel awkward removing her, but if it's a parental chat and the phone now belongs to a 9 year old, then it shouldn't be there."
d6johp,YWBTA but in some cases you have to be the AH and this is one of those cases where I say go ahead and be the AH and come back and update!
d6jq9c,"NTA. If the police have been searching as often as they have, I doubt it's for anything petty."
d6jqvn,YTA.  Just because you are going out with someone doesn't mean you have to join at the hips.  It is healthy for each to have their own friends to hang out with.  Given your gf is a bit depressed about her shrinking circle of friends it's understandable she want to spend some alone time with her remaining friend.
d6jrp4,NTA sounds like you’re trying to be ethical/honest about things whereas your partner is just trying to make an easy buck (not surprising seein as it’s business) I’d say if you’re the one that has a good relation with the vendor and are more trusted by the investors it might be time to make it on your own
d6jt66,NTA - but fences make good neighbors
d6juca,"NTA at all, I'd even say you have to do this. But they probably will take it very badly."
d6jvy9,"NTA.  This policy is bonkers.  They are effectively stealing from employees to fund their own charity, knowing that most people won't want to be seen as the opt-out-er.  I'm also curious how they can do this legally since you have a negotiated salary and they are now taking money from it without your explicit consent."
d6jyfi,"YTA

The issue is not the game they are playing. It is that they are using slurs against your (and your son's) people.

So, instead of asking them to stop playing war, ask the principle to talk to them about bias and how in play, they could choose different parties in their wars. (e.g. they can just choose two colors for each side)"
d6k00n,"NTA, by keeping this secret he’s allowing his parents to treat you in such a shitty way and talk badly of you? That’s not ok ESPECIALLY since you have a daughter who may hear what your MIL is saying about you. I’d have a conversation with your husband first telling him you’re going to tell MIL for all the reasons you’ve explained and maybe see how he responds. But yeah, nta for sure."
d6k05n,"NTA 

This is what you need to do. DURING THE ACT you need to knock really loud and hard on the door and shout “can you keep the sex noise to a minimum please?”

OR

Have a family meeting with mom, dad, you, brother, and girlfriend. If they don’t like that their privacy isn’t being respected, point out to them that you would LOVE for them to be more private and to not involve the family against their will into the sex act by forcing them to be an auditory audience. Tell them that you being involved in their sex lives is exactly the problem and could they please take more care to keep to themselves so the rest of you dont have to experience their intercourse."
d6k13j,YTA.   Bold move to fuck up by leaving the oven on and then to double down and argue with your dates roommate about it.   Would it have killed you to just own up to your mistake and apologize?

d6keka,"NTA

Misophonia is a real thing. I feel your pain."
d6kmvw,"NAH.  

How about rather than saying that you aren't going to dinner, ask your dad if you can all meet up in a private location first so you can meet your brother's girlfriend and your father's girlfriend's daughter in private rather than in public.  You are going to have to meet these people eventually, and even though your anxiety is a real thing, don't let it stop you from doing something that you want like seeing your family."
d6kmwo,"YWBTA. When you are that sick/in pain, you are 100% survival mode. That is not the time to be concerned about the comfort of your healthy friend.

d6ksp5,"YTA if you ask that of her. It's her friend's wedding and that in and of itself is a big deal. Not to diminish your anniversary, but the wedding takes precedence, it would be rude of her to not attend the reception and it would likely hurt her friend's feelings. You can celebrate your anniversary another day close to the actual date, lots of people have to do that because of work schedules, etc."
d6kzdw,"NAH - she’s approaching your ED in a way that isn’t constructive, but is trying. There definitely needs to be more active listening on her part.

I hope you have support to overcome your ED and can find foods that you can/want to eat."
d6l4f1,"NTA, but you're a fecking eejit to stay with her, she sounds like an absolute melt."
d6l5pf,"NAH

Problem is you didnt talk to them first. Now you are one the hook and you didnt clear it with the friends.

If you eat the bill, it's on you"
d6lamo,ESH. You need to leave this job if you're going to be resentful and rude in your approach to issues. Your self respect is suffering here which is totally valid but you gotta change something. Right now you're not a good team player and that's not working out for anyone. Your coworker was inappropriate but that's part of working with people
d6ldv5,"NTA - you were just trying to warn him and he became rude and insulting. Better off that he deleted you, since he seems like a jerk anyway."
d6lf2x,"NTA. If your coworker cared so much, why didn't he invite him?"
d6lhlz,"NTA, I would say no assholes at all if she seemed kinder and more appreciative but, you got your own life and she should have other friends or family members who are able to help her so she doesn’t rely on just one, or she could pay you for your help running around as her minion."
d6lhr0,"NTA - Just because they know you doesn’t mean they’re *entitled* to your performance. I can’t stand the whole “what the bride wants, the bride gets” bullshit. That doesn’t negate the fact she’s being a total asshole about this. There are other bands that I’m sure play similar music and you want to enjoy your *best friend’s* wedding. And some might say “well it’s their wedding and you’re making it about you,” and sure, that can be argued. But that’s still *your* time that you are using and they are, again, not entitled to your time if you do not want to play. Your best friend needs to grow some balls, this won’t be a good marriage if he follows the “happy wife, happy life” mantra.

(I guess your other post got removed? Here’s my comment from there)"
d6llpt,"Okay. First, putting the dogs nose in pee is not a standard and effective strategy for dog training. 

Also, yelling at the dog when they bark is not effective either.

Your grandmother probably sees that your methods don’t work. And she probably doesn’t like you shoving urine in her dogs faces."
d6lmo1,"NAH - people grow apart, no one is being cruel here."
d6ls6y,"NTA. That’s disgusting and just plain rude. He should hold it. The excuse “you take too long” is a load of rubbish because baths can take an hour plus and I’d still argue he should wait. You’re already being generous enough to let him pee, most wouldn’t even do that."
d6lwpv,"NTA they don't have to tell you, and you asking is showing that you care. Friendship does not mean you're entitled to all the details of each other's lives, it means that you support each other and enjoy each other's company."
d6lx2f,"NAH 

But she's right. Any bystander could call the cops, and you end up on the news."
d6m2ep,"NTA, but should only be informing the parent. Obviously this woman isn't an attentive mother, but it still goes a long way to say, ""Did you know your son was playing on the roof?"" Rather than, ""Your son shouldn't be playing on the roof."""
d6m2tj,"NTA - I cut myself for years throughout middle and high school. Classmates saw and never said/did anything. I wish they had. Self harm is always a cry for help, even if it's one we don't realize we're saying. Please talk to a counselor or teacher you trust about this. Though self harm is not the same as being suicidal, it's incredibly dangerous and is associated with higher rates of infection and unintentional suicides from accidents. Yes, she may be mad at you in the short term (though, honestly, if she's rolling up her sleeves in classes, the report could come from anyone and she may not know), but in the long run she will thank you if she gets the help she needs."
d6m9b1,NTA. Your SO is seriously lacking in empathy. What she did was nearly vindictive. It's like she wanted all the good feelings of having done something nice for someone at the expense of hurting someone else. Pretty callous.

Definitly not the asshole here, but its your dad doing anything about his girlfriends actions?"
d6mclr,I don’t think you’re an asshole but personally I’d just rather be told an amount. But context matters a lot too.
d6mcnn,"NAH, but it would be rad of you to set up a separate thing for just the two of you, that way you can accommodate your friend and have something looser for everyone else. 

I understand why you feel shitty about this, though, and I probably would as well in the same situation. I don't think you're an asshole on this, though."
d6mkgz,Info: Have you lied about washing your hair in the past.
d6mm8l,I have to say YTA  gently because your grandfather has cared for you for so long and deserves you by his side. Please try to get your medication back so you're able to spend time with him. Or try to go with someone else to distract you
d6mn03,"NTA, assuming volume levels are as you describe.

Roommate needs to close his door, invest in a white noise machine / box fan and or earplugs. 

Or ask Alexa to play white noise for him."
d6mn4x,"NTA. Dont go into debt so she can live in a fancy apartment. You gave her 3+ months notice and she has plenty of time to find a roommate or lower her expectations. Shit happens, she can get over it."
d6mou6,"NTA. And, you really need to think about how seriously you want to entwine yourself with someone so financially vulnerable to manipulation."
d6mp6d,NTA-but you could have screwed yourself out of a possible good recommendation and/or reference
d6mrz1,"NTA. A woman called you, wouldn't identify herself, instructed you to travel to where she was, only to berate you for a conversation she was not involved in? 

This is just bizarre."
d6mx9z,"NTA you are the parent and you get to parent your child however you want. Also, I presume since you and your grandmother don’t get along that your child has probably only seen, let alone talk, to her a handful of times. To your child it would feel like staying with a stranger."
d6mxe3,"NTA

I would definitely not have my family nor my in-laws at my place for longer than 3 days in a row. Parents and in-laws tend to have some sense of entitlement and not respecting boundaries. 

Whether they can afford an Airbnb or not, it can still be solved by offering to pay half of the costs. If they chose to spend that money on presents, they are basically choosing what's best for you and just ignoring what you are telling them. 

I would strongly recommend for you to read more about settling boundaries and how to communicate them effectively, because it's a whole art. Not only it's about when it's OK to have boundaries or not, but also how it invades your own thoughts. 

This has nothing to do with their disability. This is extremely common between family members. If you wish to keep a healthy relationship with them, you need to reset your own understanding of the dynamics. 

Therapy or just some time to read about the matter should be enough, and they might be offended at the beginning (most parents are), but its for the common good."
d6mykv,"YTA. Not driving is not an excuse to not know the city you live in. You should 100% be able to tell someone what part of town you’re in. 

Also, 2nd time he’s had to charge your car? YTA for that too then. Why didn’t you ask for a jump from one of the 100 other people at sonic..."
d6mytx,"NTA

> that she's the best I'll ever have 

I'm sorry, but your GF is trash.

You are also clearly not a priority for her.

It's time to upgrade. The best revenge will be to show just what a good girlfriend you can get, because she is actually awful."
d6n66x,"NTA - It’s your flash drive. It’s your possession and you want it back, I don’t think you’re an asshole at all. I wouldn’t even think you’re an asshole if you’re MORE insistent. You’re obviously thinking about it a lot and really want it back. I’m sure your trust for him with anything of yours is already shot, but this isn’t helping his case."
d6n7eg,"YTA. You didn't like someone's choice in music and you tried to parent a kid that's not yours. Teach your own child that there are things you don't want them to say. And calling a kid ""princess"" to make fun of them is a dick thing to do."
d6n7kz,NTA. If shes going to be a doctor she needs to put the work in. If shes going to half ass this she will half ass working with a patient.
d6n7vy,NTA. You are not required to be friends with anyone. Cut your losses and build a new tribe.
d6nay8,"NAH - If he gets salmonella, he'll learn not to under cook chicken. You mentioning it won't change the fact that he ate it and won't change the fact that he might spend the night shitting his brains out."
d6nb3w,"NAH

Best friends with benefits isn't an actual thing. That's a relationship. You broke up with him."
d6nbm0,"INFO: does the child have anything that someone would want to “fix”? If not, YWBTA. You are projecting your trauma into a hypothetical issue that does not exist. The conversation at best would be awkward, at worst would be creepily accusatory for no reason."
d6ng2m,NTA. No one  should ever make promises like this.
d6ngni,"NTA. It is NOT a dick move to bring up a baby's size, if you're not being rude about it. I work at a daycare, and I'm always cuddling the babies and talking about how ""chonky"" or how little they are. Every baby is not the same."
d6nhr1,"NTA if you tell her. Honestly, I would tell John he needs to be honest with his gf because regardless of if he regrets it, what he did to her was wrong. I would let him know that keeping this a secret is making you feel wrong and that he  needs to tell her or else you will."
d6nm9s,"NTA

She's an obnoxious pest with no legitimate business at your house.  Peeking through your windows was especially creepy.  This all allows a certain level of belligerence from you, including the divorce comments in the heat of the moment."
d6ntmv,"Disagree completely. 

He has romantic feelings for her. He doesn't WANT to be just friends. It is completely fine and reasonable, especially after three short weeks, to know ""hey. This isnt good for me right now"". It has nothing to do with ""pride"". If you have romantic feelings first and foremost, and dont want to be friends, that doesnt mean something is wrong with you."
d6nva9,"NTA. Never fall for the ""they're family and you must make this work"" bullshit."
d6nvs4,NTA. Dealing with something similar with my neighbor. They want to cut trees down that are on my property. Not happening.
d6nw8h,NTA - If she cant take care of a dog then she shouldn’t have one. That’s animal abuse.
d6nxeo,[deleted]
d6o0ji,"NTA you’re allowed to end the ride at any time, she was being abusive and deserved to be kicked to the curb."
d6o0n7,NTA. She's your fiancée. Her debt will be your debt one day. Plus it's good to establish from early on how you will both deal with your finances. Don't wait until you're married to realize she's financially irresponsible or that you don't have the same goals.
