d4rpf0,"ESH. You set a spending limit of 1000$ and then you immediately broke that limit for some fancy instrument you insist is now partly yours just because of the cost. You bring it up in arguments years later and seem to care more about the cost of the gift then the meaning behind it. All of that makes you TA.

However I agree that your wife is TA for getting you such a simple and cheap gift. If it had been something a little more personal but still cheap not so much. Or if she had put attention and care into picking it out then that would be different.

You two might need to see someone because obviously there are some disagreements on what exactly you both expect out of each other and your marriages. You're very clearly not on the same page here and if you want things between you to work you need to bridge this gap soon."
d4rq4p,NAH.  Consider requesting a quieter keyboard from management using their complaints as reasoning.
d4rtv6,"You would be setting yourself up for a distant, nonphysical, and potentially resentful relationship with your kids. There are plenty of places in the US you can move to have a richer social life without making yourself basically unreachable by your children the majority of the time."
d4rtvi,"You’re not an asshole, just a dingus. Tell your freakin parents, what’s the worst that could happen? They’re supportive? Stop being a dingus and tell them, so if it is MS you have a support system"
d4ru8z,Take it to a shelter. If they ask what happened tell them idk you leave it out all day.
d4ruk7,"However you decide to proceed, don’t let your parents pick up the slack.  If he wants a third of the result without anything near a third of the work- tell him to buy his fuel.  

Or do jobs for your parents around the house the rest of the year to earn it. I understand your annoyance though, particularly after their comments a few years ago"
d4rvna,"NTA, because it's not necessarily the money you're upset about. You've been betrayed by the two men you trusted most and who insisted on nurturing your dependence on them, only to have them both screw you. Over other women. Your father's betrayal rings similarly to your ex husband's. You are justified in your anger, you are not the asshole."
d4rvt0,"> He just simply said what he felt at the moment

He badgered you for some time to get permission to use that word, then admits in a bout of anger, that this is what felt natural for him. You're NTA, just naive.  Someone asking for permission to use that word against you is a racist, and no friend of yours."
d4rwed,YTA She’s pregnant and their relationship comes first. It won’t make sense to you because you’re not in the relationship. You have no idea why she has trust issues and you need to just accept and respect it. Your emotions aren’t a priority here.
d4rwqo,"I hate to say it, but YTA here.. You said it first and she just agreed. Don't say something if you don't want it thrown back into your face. She didn't say you weren't pretty. Some people just have that ""exceptionally pretty"" thing going on for them. You need to work on your confidence. I am sorry that you feelings are hurt, but this situation really says more about your thoughts on yourself than anything else."
d4rx9a,"NTA - They went behind your uncle’s back in an attempt to get half of your gift back. If anything, they’re the asshole."
d4s0is,"YTA. She isn't asking you to be there for him, she's asking you to be there for her. Whether or not you give a fuck about this guy, she does. You're her family and she's hoping to get some support. Buck the fuck up and be there.

Edit: Also, most people aren't fans of hospitals, you're not in a unique situation, so that's a terrible excuse."
d4s429,NTA. Your friends need to grow up if that's all it takes to upset them to the point of calling you names.
d4s6hk,"YTA because you are using your girlfriend, if it was me I wouldn't appreciate it"
d4scuy,"NTA specifically because your friend has not kept you up to date on their apartment search and have not paid you for the resources you spend to care for the dog. 

However, YWBTA (relatively) if you did it without notice. Give the friend a hard deadline “ I no longer have the capability to care for your dog. You have to pick him up by XXXX or I will be taking him to XXXX shelter” and stick to the deadline. I also wouldn’t go into detail about WHY you can’t take care of the dog, or even that the friend hasn’t kept up hurt end of the bargain- just a Kurt “I can’t continue to care for the dog” and don’t let them argue"
d4se3p,YTA but only because you should never bleach clean hair. You should avoid washing for at least a day or two before bleaching. However you should also not pull her hair when you are drying it. It shouldn’t be hard to just ask her to turn her head.
d4seih,NTA. He's feeding you an excuse because he doesn't want to get married. You guys need to have a serious conversation about where your relationship is going.

d4sjaj,"I don't know where you are but in Australia people's property usually ends about 2 metres before the street. This land, called the nature strip or the verge is owned by the council even though the property owners maintain it. It's where a footpath or sidewalk would be if there was one.

Anyone can walk there whether it's grass or pavement so they don't have to walk on the street. If it's the same where you are then NTA. It's public land."
d4slgh,NTA of course. That’s so weird. Start being honest? Tell them when you want to go to bed and they need to go home. Or when “actually I don’t feel like hanging out today”

d4sstg,YTA. I asked you nicely to throw it away after cleaning it up multiple times before. I never called you “barbaric” either. The trash can is two feet away. We have candles.
d4tefp,"NTA, but the problem is you are expecting her to fill these friendship needs. I think you should be the one filling these needs by meeting new friends. And I'm not saying to drop/lose your current friendships."
d4tev4,"NTA.

However, I feel like this is more a job for r/legaladvice.   Screwing with their equipment, when they have an agreement with the land owner, could potentially put you in hot water.

A judge doesn't care whether or not you're an asshole."
d4tfe4,"NAH. 

I don't think you're an asshole but I think you two need to talk to each other about this if it's bothering you.

As a side note; my best friend and I have been friends for 17 years.  I'm male and she's female.  There never has been and never will be anything romantic between us.  I love her like a sister.  We regularly go out to eat together, or go to concerts together, or go to movies together and her boyfriend of 10 years knows and trusts me.  He and I have become friends too.

I think it's important to realize that friendships are important relationships too."
d4tghm,"YWBTA I'm Mexican, raise and born. I don't see anything wrong about the party itself, that's ok for me, you have my blessings. But don't have the ofrenda. They are only for el día del muerto, it would be extremely disrespectful if you have one."

d4thfc,"NTA.  she should’ve checked first and if it was her doing a kind gesture , she doesn’t have much of a right to be so angry"
d4tj41,"YTA even though AH feels too strong a word here. I’m using it as a stand in for you’re responsible. Anxiety is understandable and easy for me to find empathy for. 

1) You provided extra info in a comment that you would have been upset to leave alone, and it was asked because that is the obvious solution here. If you are not willing to leave alone when you need to then you are essentially saying that when you are anxious your partner needs to leave the situation with you to satisfy you. That simply isn’t reasonable. It sets your partner up to try to persuade you to stay, which seems like it’s running roughshod over your boundaries until you consider the fact that what she may be doing is making a case for HER to stay. I somehow doubt that her saying “okay babe, see you at home!” felt like an option. Please correct me if this is wrong. We can’t make other people responsible for our feelings in this way. It’s like holding hostage because her only option becomes to leave. It ultimately seems that you use an ultimatum to get her to leave without time to say goodbye. 

2) Snapping at others makes us the asshole. You were anxious and snapped, which is no different than being any other emotion and snapping. 

3) You seem to have said yes verbally and then held others to account for your discomfort when you didn’t uphold the boundary. Unless someone holds power over us in an important way or our autonomous action is blocked in a meaningful way we are responsible for upholding our own boundaries."
d4tv0b,"Move Out.  Stop going to dinner with your parents.  Stop taking vacations with your parents.  Move into the most sad apartment imaginable and find your own way.  Those are, oddly, the best years of your life.  If you stay, you know the stupid dynamic you are in and you choose to stay. No asshole judgement here.  But if you stay in this dynamic, you are assholing yourself."
d4twf6,"NTA.. MIXED feelings.. even if the circumstances aren’t that good just give the person a heads up, say your peace & go. but he also sounds kinda gross/needs to do better so hey lol. at least your out"

d4tzcf,"NTA - unless she lays rent then she can fuck off. Your roommate is babied and needs to cut her off a bit. 

I’d be lounging in my boxers watching Netflix when they show up because I’m just petty like that."
d4tzkv,"NTA., this one is personal for me too. My father in law LIVES IN MY APARTMENT COMPLEX. No exaggeration, I can see his front door from my front door. He hasn’t seen my kids in a year and a half (besides passing by in cars). My Mother in law lives 5 minutes away and can’t see our kids do to her hectic golf schedule... it’s been about 10 months or so... And my parents live about 20 minutes away and if I text them right now at 10pm and asked if they wanted to see my kids, I bet my Dad could make it here in only 18... 
you are absolutely not the asshole for expecting the relationship to be two sided. If they complain, they’re welcomed to visit you.. also remind them that they’re the ones who told you to leave because they were done with your son.. I mean who says that??"
d4u135,">he refuses to let me take my implant out

What the Kentucky fried fuck? NTA. Are you sure this dude is worth it?"
d4u2cj,"Yes, Yta if you do this. This is crabs in a bucket. You got out and they want to pull you back in because it's where they are comfortable keeping you. What you need to do is stop tolerating it. 

I will not discuss this any more. I don't want to hear any more comments on it. If you keep saying this stuff, I will leave. Then when they do, leave. Every. Single. Time. Eventually they will either stop mentioning it or you'll realize they care more about their comfort than your health and that they're not worth it."
d4u8yx,"NTA.

If she were to let you know ahead of time, it would be different.  But she's not telling you when she does it, and broke her promise when she made it.  I think you two definitely need to at least talk about *letting you know ahead of time* if she drives her friend home."
d4uac6,"YTA 

You REALLY need to move on from this. And if you can't, then get professional help."
d4uebf,"NTA 

If you genuinely feel that you have received sub-standard care then the reporting process is there for precisely that. That said, a misdiagnosis doesn't necessarily equal malpractice (though it can it some cases). Just don't do it out of revenge. If you report them, do it to improve outcomes for their other patients. 

I'm not ready to say that the doctor isn't the asshole here, hence the NTA."
d4ui4i,"ESH.. and I definitely mean EVERYONE for one reason or another. You for trying to dictate who attends your estranged father’s funeral, your parents for not respecting your lack of religion and not sticking up for you, your uncle/cousins for not respecting your lack of religion, and your husband for manipulating you with his illness. This just sounds like one giant clusterfuck that takes a paid professional to unravel."
d4ullo,"NAH- I can understand the concern but bringing it up now would create an issue when there isn't one. Like you said, that is something he should be telling her, and it didn't mean anything so it's not worth mentioning, especially 4 years later."
d4uo3c,"NTA. You sent your portion on time as requested. Their failure to do their part does not constitute you chipping in towards the late fee that was solely incurred by them not paying on time.

Plus, where the hell is $125 the “late fee”? I suggest you require documentation for every bill you chip in towards."
d4uow8,ESH are y’all 12?
d4upjw,NTA. I have no sympathy for cheaters. The divorce is a direct result of a shitty choice she made.
d4uqre,"NTA, just don't be an A-hole about it, aka, set their stuff in a neat pile on a table or on top of a machine, not on the floor - lived in a dorm, people did this all the time"
d4urim,"Honestly YTA for agreeing in the first place. It's an event that was important to your GF and you bailed on half of it and flubbed the rest. I understand just how exhausted you were, but ultimately you made the commitment knowing full well of your work schedule/potential low energy level following your shift.

Also, this post is entirely about your fatigue and your aches and the huge inconvenience to you the wedding was. No concern to your GF (who likely RSVP'd for you) at all. That says a lot."
d4uyrp,NTA.  I don't want you sneezing all over my food either.  There are other types of jobs in the world.
d4v3d7,"Provided your parents are alright with you being stoned for pickup, NAH. Do consider that coming across like you chose not to drive just so you could get stoned will make you at least look like a total asshole, and remember to act well on public transport no matter your state and not to get stoned to the point where people on the bus are gonna be like legit worried about your behaviour in some way. (same rules as drinking)"
d4v85i,"NTA. 

It is your friend who is in the wrong. Your friend is the asshole. You do not confess to someone in a committed relationship unless you're telling them because you've got to ghost them for a while to get over your feelings and it's 1000% not them so they shouldn't feel bad... and even then it's a bit weird. **You do not ask for an increase in physical intimacy form someone who has just rejected you**. 

Not only is it not on you to comfort someone you reject, not only are you not obligated to give up or bend your bodily autonomy just to make someone feel better, **but you also acted well by refusing to hug because you refused to send any potential mixed signals at all.**"

You're absolutely a shit friend.

If you developed feelings for her over time, and then talked to him about dating her, that would be one thing, and you'd be in the clear.

d4vf4f,"Wait, what? 

You didn’t want to wear the shirt if the band you were going to see? Is that a thing?

d4vj3r,NAH. You can ask and they can refuse.
d4vjtd,"Whoa. This is way above this subreddit's pay grade.


You need to get into therapy stat, with or without her (hopefully with). This was clearly on her, but it's frightening to read that you feel like a failure as a husband because of her incredibly questionable choices. Those are some pretty intense words.

d4vzmc,"NTA - You’re a human, man. You need time to heal up after getting rejected. All good, it happens. Won’t be the last time something like this happens. 

I think she’s being a little callous and doesn’t understand that it takes some stones to tell someone how you feel and that after a negative result, want some time to get your shit together before you reengage communications. 

If I was you’d I’d tell her exactly that. That you wanted some time to get your  feelings in check before continuing communication again. If she can’t  understand that your radio silence was nothing personal and continues to think it was a “get in my pants”  scenario, I just wouldn’t even bother being her friend then. Good luck homie."
d4w32b,"My whole thing is that the roommate literally sat everyone down and asked for their help with something they are struggling with, and OP is just annoyed they can't put food in the kitchen.

d4w6u1,NTA and they aren't customers if they dont buy shit
d4w7bg,NTA Once you get a dog it's your responsibility to ensure it can learn to behave in a way that doesn't bother others. Your roommate is incredibly irresponsible and she's not doing her dog a favor. She should definitely TRAIN him to stay down when saying Hi to people. Also she should train him to stay off the couch and that inside isn't the right place for wild games. Maybe you can talk some sense into her by telling her that she should do it for the dog. He could get hurt by playing so wildly or worse hurt someone and then have to pay the price for her failure to train him.

d4z570,NTA. You should NEVER be shouting at your SO in public. I've gotten really annoyed and slightly raised my voice in frustration at my SO in public and instantly realized it was not okay in the slightest. It was 100% her fault i wasnt even being a dick like your father in law seems he was being. BUT just because youre annoyed of frustrated doesn't mean you need to raise your voice. Even if you're 100% in the right shouting at somebody infront of other people is an asshole move. Makes the person feel like shit and embarrassed them. If you didn't say anything she would have probably thought she was in the wrong. Fuck that dude.

d4ztyu,"NTA. What you said was pretty restrained. I’m sure she has heard worse for her actions.  Also, it takes two to tango. Your sibling isn’t in the clear either.  Only say to her what you would say to your sibling."
d4zwp6,"NTA. And the fact that you are their son does not obligate you to live in their house forever. And you are not obligated to share living expenses if you don’t actually live in that house. You warned them with plenty of time about what would be happening. 

Please, take the role and move to where you need to, and don’t let your parents guilt you out of a great opportunity. Heck, if I had an opportunity like this I would jump at it! You are not your parents’ keeper and don’t let them talk you into thinking you are."
d4zx04,NTA earning money doing something you love? A lot of people can only dream of that
d4zy3f,"NTA, please don’t out your friend"
d50114,"NTA. Typically when you go to a place that has a different culture, you make sure you understand that culture and act appropriately. Asking the culture to be more accommodating for the visitor seems way less efficient. 

Also when you said it was in the 90s I thought you meant the decade. It took me a second and a half to realize that you meant the temperature."
d503ft,"NTA.

You weren't being an asshole (hell she deserved to be snapped at) but you were being unprofessional."
d5075q,"NAH.  I don't disagree with the rationale that ""your yard, your business.""  But the same applies to the neighbor.  If she's in her house, your actions shouldn't be affecting her, either.  I.e., she shouldn't have to keep all her windows closed in her own house to accommodate your smoking.  You're not an asshole for smoking in your yard.  She's not an asshole for not wanting your smoke to affect her in her house."
d507xy,"Oooh, that is a fantastic idea, and we are getting ready for a big upgrade to our auditorium. I'll make that suggestion. Thanks, fellow Redditor!"
d50a5q,"YTA. They did y'all a huge favor for a very poorly trained dog. I would, at minimum, pay them the 300."
d50b9w,"NTA. Expressing concern for injured animals is a pretty normal human response. Chances are your roommate is concerned but is worried that by admitting guilt they would be liable for the cost of the vet visit. Which they are. Your roommate is definitely the asshole here.

EDIT. I'm beginning to think I may have overreacted. I don't actually know if your roommate is responsible for the cost of the vet visit. That's an r/legaladvice topic. I do believe they should take responsibility for their pets actions though."
d50cm6,"NTA. Holding the door for people is common decency, and any woman interpreting it as “special treatment” because of her gender is just looking for things to get upset about."

Poor guy probably just wants this whole situation to go away and you saying something probably isn't helping that outcome. You didn't do anything *wrong* but also didn't help the situation since it resulted in more drama. Honestly, I'd stay out of this from here on out."
d50tkk,"NTA. I’m guessing that she was already stressing out from a noisy classroom and either you and your friend were unlucky, the giggle was the straw that broke the camel’s back, or she picked on you two because she knew you’d obey."
d50zye,"YTA. 

How is this any different than asking someone to pass the salt and pepper? If you have to ""get up"" to be able to reach the salt and pepper, you're probably reaching too far and it's better to ask a person closer to pass it to you."

Jesus why are you even with this person?
You need someone who understands your needs and treats you with compassion and respect 
This guy sounds abusive and will probably get worse over time"
d511an,"Big yikes. YTA. It’s her house and she’s allowed to decide when she wants company and when she doesn’t. Her reasons were also 100% valid. She has obligations outside of your relationship and space is good for everyone. 

Also, it’s pretty immature to refuse to speak to her until she apologizes. Especially since she has absolutely nothing to apologize for. Giving the silent treatment and pushing people away when you don’t get what you want is super toxic and manipulative. At the bare minimum, you owe HER an apology for this behavior."
d512pt,"NTA - it’s totally natural for you to want your own space in your home. I love my mom but if she were at my house every single day I’d get annoyed too. 

It sounds like maybe she doesn’t feel super “at home” in her new place and feels more comfortable at yours. Maybe ask her gently if that’s the case and suggest hanging out at her new house together?

Edit because typo"
d5136k,"NTA - She has two fully capable helpers right now. The only decisions you can make are based on the ""right now"" not the ""what if""."
d513c1,NTA - Sounds like you need to replace the hole that your mother left with more communication with your sister.
d517um,"NTA

And...(you don’t want to hear this) but you “fix it” by leaving him alone.

Anyone with addiction issues that are not addressed is NOT capable of being in a relationship.  It will “suck the life” out of you.  Energy vampires.

d518ge,"NAH. He's comfortable living like that, but it bothers you. Sounds like you're just not particularly compatible, so asking him to move out is fine.

d51e31,"NTA but have you considered working with her to get her own desktop, especially given this new hobby software?"
d51ixs,"YTA

Not for lying to her, that was justified, but for knowingly leaving plastic trash at a beach. That is disgusting."
d51jaq,"NTA. Masturbation is normal and it is shown that men are far more visual than women when it comes to what turns them on. You shouldn't have been made to feel bad about that. However in future relationships, consider opening up the door to those conversations when you can. It's okay and encouraged to talk to your partner about what they consider cheating to be as it relates to porn, and be open about having conversations about what types of material you use to masturbate. Also consider keeping them on a private album, not to be secretive but to prevent anyone accidentally stumbling across them and not realizing it's jerk off material."
d51jx0,"YTA.  This kind of behavior is seen as normal for feminine people, and yet you're upset that people who identify as male are doing it as well.  That kind of double standard isn't cool - especially because you seem upset specifically because the one person involved is gay, and thus acting like this non existent ""threat"" is more than them just being affextionate."
d51llq,NTA. So it's fine if he gets the information from her via email but not text? I don't quite understand his reasoning here.
d51n5l,NTA you should explain to her about those that live in glass houses
d51ng1,NTA You did your very best to warn her about the dangers of alcohol. If she misinterpreted it it's not your fault.
d51nz3,NAH.  Friendships change and end.  It sounds like that's where you are at with these friends.  Concentrate on finding new friends who are more receptive to keeping in touch and doing things with you.
d51p76,"YTA if you punish the cat. Not for anything else. Please just take ownership of this innocent animal or rehome it. It’s effectively your cat now. There’s an assistance subreddit, go there, post an amazon wishlist and we will send you cat supplies."
d51p7s,"NTA but your boyfriend is. A parent plus loan should be paid for by the parents. It’s his choice to let this affect your futures. 

What else is he going to cave to her on? What you name your baby? Letting her live for free in your marital home? Cut loose a guy who is putting his mom before you."
d51rxu,This is pretty standard roommate stuff.  NTA for asking her to be mindful of you being asleep when she's getting up those days.
d51s0h,"You are the asshole. 

Also, your boyfriend is an asshole."
d51t98,YTA for making a deal you don't intend on honoring. NTA for wanting to keep your name. Guess my man gonna get to pee standing up!
d51ugi,"NAH: If you feel that you need to move for your own health (sleep deprivation) and your education, than you should absolutely do so.

That said, part of having roommates is learning to negotiate. I'm not saying what she was doing was completely appropriate, however it's also not fair to expect someone to make absolute no noise, or to hang out late if they don't have classes the next morning (IE: come home late, or wake up before you). They are allowed their space/noise levels as well, appropriately.

I am a light sleeper myself, so I get it... It's something you're going to have to learn to deal with. I suggest investing in some good ear plugs, or a sound machine."
d521ez,"NTA, not least because grown adults should be able to parallel park. How did they get a license? Can they not just practice?"
d523jg,"NAH - This one is really tough. I don't think it's wrong for you to feel hurt by his comment, but I also don't think it's wrong of him to express how he felt.  He clearly attempted to share your joy when he learned about it, so it's not vindictive or anything.  It could be a maturity thing, but it might not be."
d524yn,"NTA. Enough. She's totally TA. Hostile, problem-causing and out of her lane. Just drop her for good."
d526yt,"NTA; you are doing her a huge favor by taking care of the cats. You aren’t even in a relationship anymore and you are not only caring for them, but it sounds like you may also be providing for them financially? 

If you want her to become more communicative, you should let her know you absolutely are doing her a favor, and if she doesn’t change, she needs to come get her cats. It is common curtesy."
d5285v,"NTA.

> I was taught that if someone shows you hospitality, you leave the space as clean as/cleaner than when you found it.

Absolutely this. He showed no respect for your space, you're well within your rights to refuse him usage of it."
d52933,"NTA, you’re all adults here . You’re not supposed to be snooping and reporting on who’s banging who on a daily basis ."
d5293n,"NTA. 99% of times, when people pretend you need to cut off ties with someone they have split from, you should just ignore their immaturity."
d52frh,"There's a privacy setting on Facebook where you can block specific people from seeing your posts. Might be helpful, and will cause less drama than deleting them. They'll just think you never post anything on your page."
d52fxr,NTA. Your friend isn't really a good friend because she seems to expect you to emotionally cater to her by keeping your joy to yourself in areas of life where she's not experiencing the same kind of joy.
d52h0g,"NAH. I would say preventing your daughter from choking was more urgent than the possibility of crashing.

Cut your wife some slack though, it sounds like you were both freaked out."
d52h2z,"NTA it's a legitimate concern, and if he's hiding the results, it might be a valid concern"
d52hu4,"NAH

However I think you're being a little nitpicky. The struggles you listed are mainly internal, more to do with your self image rather than how you actually look. So she's not really aware of those and she just sees 'perfection' or how she would rather look.

Doesn't sound like she's saying anything malicious, just the typical reply to someone 'complaining' when they have nothing to complain about."
d52orn,"NAH - first and foremost, I feel like it’s disrespectful to honor only the people who are in the AF by asking them to wear their uniforms and then specifically ask you not to because you’re in a different branch of the military. Not to mention that your suit will be different anyway if you just get to wear a tux. On the other hand, while the bride seems unreasonable it is her wedding and if it’s going to make it go smoother for her, just wear the tux. Weddings are hard enough and stressful enough to plan. It’s better to be nice than right.

Edit: y’all I said it’s “her” wedding bc the OP paints the situation without how the groom feels, making it seem he respects his wife’s wishes or doesn’t have an opinion on it. Obviously there’s not enough info to tell, but I would have said “their” wedding if I felt that OP was including the groom in the conflict."
d52q0k,"NTA, but I don’t think you’d need to confront him. This is a fun thing you do and your leader is cool with your reason for not being there in character. Don’t be upset for going even though you couldn’t preform! If anything, I would just brush it off and chalk it up to J being over dramatic."
d52q90,Question: does the wife get any alone time?
d52rhn,"YTA

Assuming there's no other information of note to your story, the other person who **co-owned** the dog should 100% be the first person you contact if you need to give the dog away.  

In fact, it sound like he should probably have got both dogs in the first place."
d52u1i,"YTA 100000%. Holy shit, she double and triple checked with you to make sure you weren’t going to back out, I’m assuming because you have a history of doing things like this. You could have talked this decision through with her, but instead made your decision in secret and waited until only 2 weeks were left until the agreed upon move?? What is she supposed to do now? You don’t seem to care at all that her being essentially homeless is a direct result of your actions. I wouldn’t answer your calls either OP."
d52v1f,"NTA but would bear in mind weddings are super pricey and there may be a valid reason you didn't get an invite. 

Have an open conversation, not confrontation :)"
d52wf4,"NTA: You can invite anyone you'd like. Be prepared for some backlash though, not because you did anything wrong but because people are jealous that they weren't invited. Their jealousy is not your issue."
d52wu2,"NTA. You should probably just ghost this ""Abe"" guy, because it sounds like he doesn't respect your boundaries and isn't taking your ""hints."" Just tell him you're not interested in him that way."
d52yq0,NTA   Your BIL is TA and your husband is a huge man-baby who doesn't want to grow up and accept that life isn't one long fun trip.  You are not being controlling by making him cancel a secret trip your family can't afford when there is work that needs to be done so you can pay the bills.  He is treating you like you are his Mommy and he can go play while you do all the work.  What makes him even a bigger asshole is that he kept it secret.  You don't keep secrets like that in a marriage.  What was he going to do just leave you a note that he was jetting off for a fun va-cay while you did the work that paid the bills?  Hopefully this therapist can help him see why he is wrong on this issue and how he needs to grow up.

d534rt,"ESH: You both need to learn how to win, and lose, appropriately.

You aren't trying ""shock therapy"". It sounds like you're trying to annoy her on purpose. I'm not sure why you think this is going to work."
d5370w,"YTA and by the sound of it, a shite friend. A girl tries to be nice to you and you just assume it’s fake? Why should she have to change to fit int he group, if by the sound of it, you’re not making any effort to be accommodating, even if for your friends sake?"
d5388h,NTA- There’s gotta be a better place for him to talk and especially if it’s effecting you and your baby brother. He has to understand that
d53d6q,"NTA. Sounds like a very toxic group of girls who just expect everyone to bend over for them. While being a bit more diplomatic in your speech- or more even better, simply not saying anything and moving away- would’ve been a better option, this group beyond pushed their boundaries."
d53dnk,NAH because he is just imagining that plan and you are free to choose
d53eql,"NTA. It's really getting old hearing variations of ""dont tell me how to raise my child"". When you sit back and let your kid do whatever they want and it ends up negatively impacting other people due to your neglect, you cant expect nobody to say anything. On that note, it could have been said without the salty attitude, but you remained pretty civil and it was warranted."
d53lxg,"NAH. I live with multiple supervisors of competing and uncertain authority. It’s tricky, so to the extent I can offer some advice, I’d say it’s probably a bad idea to request one over the other. You should say it’s been unclear who you answer to and maybe make a very delicate suggestion about it, but generally you can’t choose your boss. It could get very uncomfortable for you if it doesn’t go your way and “Jim” finds out about your request. Play it real tight amigo."
d53nz6,"NTA. Jane was costing you your reputation and, even worse, stealing from the kids. Furthermore, it’s your bosses’ responsibility to confirm the suspicion before taking action. You did well by telling your bosses. Jane’s the asshole for not telling the bosses herself."
d53ov9,NTA - You don't have the money anyway even if you could help out. Easy answer.
d53p1s,"NTA. I live in Utah, polygamists aren't that uncommon around here. Polygamy sounds abusive in every way, at least how the FLDS do it, and this post has many of the reasons why. You don't owe him anything, he's your father by blood only.

And to be clear, my opinion here is on patriarchal polygamy, especially when run by religion. Polyamorous is a very different case."
d53rfb,"NAH. Sounds like you're polyamorous and your boyfriend is monogamous. I can see why he would be uncomfortable, though. He's within his right to be uncomfortable, but I really think you two should consider if you're actually compatible long-term or not."
d53sb7,"NAH

This is one natural outcome of friendships. All you have to do is stop making an effort. Most likely the friendship will die out on its own."
d53ul4,Definitely NTA WTF it should be your sister's own responsibility to manage herself. She needs to learn how to be more self-independent of herself especially for things like studying. Which is something almost everyone does them self. You've done more than enough for your sister she should do things herself now. She's in goddamn high school.
d53vy6,NTA. In my country it would even be fraud to do what they are suggesting.
d53xcf,"NTA - The way this woman went about finding your friend after only seeing photos of him is super creepy. If a man did this to a woman on a dating app his actions would be labeled creepy, because it's a weird thing to do."
d53xsd,"NTA

At least NTA as written.  In this story, you are so clearly and cleanly NTA that it makes me suspicious as to it's completeness and/or truthfulness."
d53yz0,"NTA - he’s probably at a loss for what to say and do, so he goes to your stepmom (the woman he’s closest with) for advice. he may have your best interests at heart, and most likely the attitude in which he tells her your issues is not in a gossipy tone, but more of an advice seeking way. 

your stepmom, however, sounds a lot like my mom, lol. i’ve learned that you can’t tell her anything, because she simply can’t understand that someone can be depressed for no reason at all. (“JuSt WoRk OuT Or SoMeThInG” -Mom)

perhaps seek professional counseling. it doesn’t hurt to try, and you can be completely assured that what you tell them won’t be relayed to anyone else."
d53z69,"NTA

But it is time you both talk to your respective people and clarify holidays and what you plan to do moving forward. You need to do this now.

IDK if you plan on having kids, but it will only make things worse when/if you do. 

She's his mother, so she needs to be dealt with by him. And none of that vague shit. He needs to be clear and direct. But before that, you both need to come to a solid compromise on this.

You are not nor will you be the last couple to encounter this holiday crap and it is best to hash it out sooner rather than later."

d54lzi,"NTA

Depression sucks (I would know) but you can't shit all over everyone else and make your problems theirs. She's barely working. She needs to take care of the majority of the chores. You still did some hard duty chores and she has the nerve to flip out on you. Is she seeing a therapist? If she's not working on her problems, then she's toxic and you don't need that in your life."
d54mzv,"NAH, but you should have a heart to heart with him ASAP."
d54oby,"YTA

>I think that its disrespectful

Any time you're convinced that your partner is disrespecting you over something you made up., you're probably the asshole. You go to bed and wake up at a time that's unreasonably early for a lot of adults; she shouldn't have to keep the same schedule as you in order to be your girlfriend."
d54ru9,"NTA with the huge caveat that it's only if you're being truthful about your sisters not doing shit. It seems a bit like an exaggeration, but then I have known people who grew up in households where some people had to do a lot more than others, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt.

And I took the ""women's work"" as more of a retort to show his mom the flaws in her logic than as a sincere statement. OP, if you were being serious though, get that out of your head. Having a dick (or not) doesn't make you any better or worse at mowing, washing dishes, etc."

You playing the game makes no difference to whether or not she will enjoy the game. Unless you're a spoiler or something. 

This whole ""if you do something then I cant do it"" is so weird. 

That being said: did you get her the switch, or did you get both of you the switch. If you meant both of you, then you really didnt get *her* a present so much as a household item.


Edit: changed to NAH. Not sure the BF is an asshole for playing a game while the GF isnt ariund, but the GF isnt an asshole for wishing he wouldn't. Shes flirting with asshole behavior by her reaction though, which strikes me as pretty close to ""I'm taking my ball and going home!"""

d55bpm,"NTA. I might get flack for this, but I think you did the right thing. A bunch of 16 year-olds with a lot of alcohol and 25+ cars? *Someone* was going to drive home drunk, probably many someones. 

I understand why your neighbor might be peeved, because it's not *directly* your business, but hot damn. Someone needed to take responsibility."
d55dd5,"NTA.  Never co-sign for loans for others.  If they can't get the loan based on their own income/credit, either they don't make enough to afford the payments, or their credit is bad because they don't pay their bills.

And if he's doing ""pay 4 years and turn it in"" - that's a lease, and if he (or you) turns the car in before the 4 years is up - he (and you) is still responsible for the remaining payments.  Cars don't hold their value, so it's pretty much guaranteed you will owe more than it's worth (and you are responsible for the difference)"

I'm so sorry about your parents, what a difficult time for all of you.

You're at the right age, but youre timing might be off. That being said, if you conceived today, you still have another 40 weeks to get geared up.

The caregiver brother is likely emotionally exhausted. So his reluctance to have a baby in the house is understandable.  Make it clear your expectations from him don't include childcare.

Ironically,  it sounds like your parents house needs a new baby in it, to wake everyone up to the joy of life.  (Sorry, got a little corny right there)."
d57sij,"NTA. But they would only contact you if both parents (all the other numbers they gave) are unreachable. It might even be that the forms required a certain number of different contacts and they couldn't think of anyone else.

d57tny,"YTA for quite a few reasons. 

1. He’s not a sperm bank, he’s a person that deserves to know if he fathers a child.

2. You keep assuming and giving us excuses as to why he wouldn’t want to be a parent but you don’t have the decency to give him the chance to make his own decision. You said it yourself that you don’t know a thing about him so how can you say that he wouldn’t want to be in his child’s life?

3. You’re not only taking away something from the guy but also from your child. What if your kid wants to know who their dad is and why he was never in the picture? Are you going to lie to them or tell them it’s because you never told their dad that they exist.

4. Bio dad’s info can be medically important! What if your child is sick and there can be a hereditary problem? This can help doctors treat or prevent. That’s why when you go to the doctor they have you fill out a chart and usually ask you questions about family medical history.

5. He might not want to be a dad. Your assumptions might be correct and he might freak out and want nothing to do with it. That’s always a very possible scenario and apparently the one you’re hoping for. If that’s the case then you can seek legal help and hopefully get his rights terminated based on what state you live in. At least it will be HIS choice and not a forced one. 

I would understand if you didn’t want to get him involved if you weren’t keeping the pregnancy, but you are. 
If you know his contact info I really suggest you give him a call. Telling him over the phone might be better since you don’t know this person or how they will react. This way you can avoid any dramatic or possibly violent behavior and then take it from there."

If you look over your rental agreement with the mall there will probably be a clause in there about not making the mall look bad, not being rude to customers, etc...

Bottom line, he’s got a disability. If you tell him to shut up, he’s going to feel AWFUL about himself. I understand it’s annoying. I have little patience so I’m sure I’d be annoyed, too, but you’ve gotta be a little more empathetic to his situation."

At this point, it's only a matter of months before your son is gone. The way things look, you will probably have minimal or no contact with him after he turns 18. 

You said he's an ""angry person."" That's a very unusual way to describe your child. Why is he angry? Does he have a right to be angry? Why is he not in therapy? 

You have a standing rule that he is not allowed to hang out with his friends at their house? Because they are unsupervised? At 17?? WTAF???? Do you expect him to magically grow a responsibility lobe on his brain on his 18th birthday? 

If you don't trust him to make good choices without you (or some other parent) hanging over his shoulder 24/7, then you've done a shit job of parenting. So....when you do let him off the chain, what the actual fuck do you expect? Of course, he's gonna go do exactly what you've been accusing him of doing. Even if he really doesn't want to do it. 

Then when you pick him up and he's drunk, do you wait for him to sober up and have a discussion? NO. You start in on him *while he's drunk*. What the actual fuck did you expect to happen? That he's gonna somehow pull patience, reasonableness, and responsibility outta his drunk ass? 

And you take his phone (which is okay if you paid for it, not okay if it was a Christmas/birthday gift or if someone else paid for it), and THEN...you go through the messages. Damn.... Invading the privacy of your 17yo son just because you want to. Really greaaat parenting there. THEN you get butthurt at the things you read. GROW THE FUCK UP!!!

Oh...and to just put the cherry on top of this shit cake (that you've created all by yourself), you've given him a ""get out of jail free"" call BUT this time **doesn't count** because the situation doesn't meet your standards for a ""party""?

Look, I agree with you about expensive weddings. I think $45,000 for a wedding is absolutely absurd and would push really hard against spending even half of that. But you discussed budget, came to an agreement where she spent a bit less and you spent a bit more than you imagined, and now you’re unilaterally deciding that you won’t hold up your end of the bargain because “she’ll be happier in the long run.” Marriage requires both compromise and respect, and going back on your word because you think your fiancée is a silly woman who doesn’t really know what she wants is neither of those things."

> I ended up buying her the game back for Christmas (might be an A for this one as she did not ask for it) even if she did not own a PS4. 

I think that makes you a double asshole. You should have bought and replaced her game immediately, or as soon as possible. Not give her back a game you owe her as a Christmas gift."
d5fhj0,"NAH.  Maybe you should ask your uncles if they're out, and then ask your friend if it would ""be a problem"" if they were gay?"
d5flyd,None of the backstory has anything to do with your question. It’s very common to switch off holidays to see the other side of the family for married couples when the families do not live close to one another. All you have to say is you are visiting your in-laws this year.
d5fm4r,"ESH

Your GF should have talked to you about it, just throwing it on you was the wrong way to go. 

That said, a lot of this could be solved with simple conversations, have the brother contribute to your grocery budget and let him know lights will have to go on downstairs when you need to work. If he doesn’t like it, he can move out. 

Your GF’s mom is already paying a lot of money to help support your household. Of course the brother isn’t paying to live there, his mother is footing half your rent."
d5fmzz,NTA you don't have to be friends with people you don't like. Her bad home life doesn't excuse this toxic behaviour

d5fukk,"NTA - at all. I have a coworker like this in my open office and she is sooooooooo exhausting. Like your experiences, she tells boring stories about her adult children and gives unnecessary play by plays. I just try and ignore her these days but wish I had the courage like you to tell her that."
d5fy8d,"YTA. You said yourself that 1) you don't walk the dog at the same time every day, and 2) you were sleeping. So what did you expect, for your mom to wake you up to let you know she was taking the dog based on the odd chance that you would get up and decide to walk the dog? Your mom doesn't have to inform you of all her day to day activities.

Also, regarding: 

>I have an anxiety disorder so it all just spirals into, ""what if my neighbor shot him?""

You have my sympathies... But again, it's not other people's job to tiptoe around you to avoid setting if your anxiety. Learn better coping skills, and stop blaming others."
d5g59i,NTA. I wouldn’t open a joint account with anyone until marriage.

d5ga16,NTA. Everyone has their own preferences. There is probably a time in her life where she didn’t like something someone else made.
d5gdlk,[deleted]
d5gfib,"No Assholes Here: Mixing business with family is usually a bad idea. They’re still employing both you and your BF, maybe they’d like to take a step back from that without outright asking you both to find other jobs.

The move is to find another gig (you and your BF), because salvaging the family dynamic is far more important than anything else. 

Do it with grace and class, give the proper notice, do it with love in your heart and without resentment (even if you are feeling a little salty about the reduction in hours)."
d5go6e,"YTA for sure. Someone trusted you with responsibility and you are getting power hungry. If they come back, it's their guild - that they built, and you are directly betraying their trust. There is no way around it, it's a dick move."
d5go8u,"In this situation, I am going to say YTA. You told him 'it was JUST like $200 anyway' that has to be a blow to his self-esteem because $200 sounds like A LOT to him. Plus it sounds like you're always treating him to things that he otherwise wouldn't be able to do and he sound grateful for it. You're a great friend for doing that but in this instance, you did come off to be a bit of an asshole. 

I feel like he was just trying to give you what he could and you kind rubbed it in his face and said it wasn't worth anything."
d5gvki,"YTA. Not for rehoming the puppy, that sounds like the best choice at this point, but for continuously making large decisions about pets without bothering to talk to your girlfriend. When you live with someone you don’t get to make unilateral decisions about stuff like that.

Honestly, this whole situation probably wouldn’t have even happened if you’d bothered to talk to your gf before you bought a dog."
d5h0ge,"NAH: It doesn't sound like she's being aggressive about the denials, but is just desperate. Is there anyone around that you're comfortable babysitting WITH?

I do think it's important to tackle this anxiety. Babies are wonderful, and it can be a really great way to start bonding with your niece. I understand the anxiety, and it's totally valid... But there's really only one way to move past it, and that's by facing it."
d5h1wq,"YTA: I'm really hesitant to write this, but I'm going with you're the asshole based on what you've written this post... It sounds like you have some really high expectations of him, and it isn't exactly fair.

You are **much** older than he is. He did not ask you to take on the motherly role, but you did. I'm sure he's incredibly grateful for this... But, if you're going to take on the motherly role, you need to accept that moms don't ask their kids for payback after essentially raising them. It's what moms do for their kids.

If he's struggling with school, and choosing a degree, maybe he's depressed. He's at the prime age for it. I'm 27 years old, and let me tell you... Life for our generation is *not* easy. I get the whole ""millennial are lazy"" nonsense, but seriously. It's fucking hard, and much harder than even when you were our age.

Your brother is not your babysitter. He's their uncle, and he should be allowed to be their uncle. 

Are you paying him for babysitting? It doesn't matter if he's family... It's work. If you can't afford a babysitter, I suspect you can't afford him either. Unfortunately, when you actually needed him, you probably used up all your ""free"" babysitting sessions that he was comfortable with before he started to feel used.

To summarize...

1) He does not owe you for what you did for him as a child. He was a child.

2) He is busy with school, and likely depressed and anxious due to his current life stage/age. You're already dismissing him not declaring a degree and deciding he isn't taking it seriously. He's probably depressed about this, just an FYI.

3) He is not your free babysitter. Rather than allowing him to be an uncle, you used him. Now, he's done being used."
d5h3be,"NTA - You didn't seek a supervisor out to complain about him, your supervisor asked you directly. You were being honest. It's sad that he won't have a job, but if he'd been making progress he might not have been let go."
d5h4sq,Info: why are you friends with her?
d5h916,"It feels like there are parts of the story we're not getting here.  Like, there's mention of a breakdown, and a lot of comments about ""I can accept blame for my part in what happened"", without details of what OP did.  Reading between the lines, it feels like there's some detail being left out that may partially explain or justify the cold reaction from the sister.  Regardless of it feeling that way, I'll still vote NTA for uninviting her from your wedding.  It's your day, and you can invite or not invite whomever you want."
d5he1k,"NAH. I mean, you’re sick and that sucks but that’s neither her fault nor her problem. And she probably also wants to sleep in her bed lol"
d5hexv,"NTA - I too, am not fond of my family, they're not bad people, i just don't have any interest in maintaining a relationship with them. Family are just people, they're not any more special than your neighbour or the guy that delivers your packages. Blood relation means anything you want it to mean, that could be everything or nothing, its completely your choice. 

Something my partner said that i've always resonated with. If they weren't your family, would you be friends with them?"
d5hfhl,"YTA: I'm so sorry that you're dealing with this, but your other friends deserve an explanation. You are ghosting them for something that has literally nothing to do with them.

I didn't want to write this verdict, but you really should be open with them. Or at least, say goodbye to them.

On a side note, because this is not relationship advice but you're asking for advice... Depending on how long this accusation has been going on for, you may just need to wait for it to cool down and for your friend to process everything. If possible, try to have one more sit down with them."
d5hgt0,"YTA 
You adults, you need to grow up and tell her how you’re feeling and you can do that in a way that isn’t soul crushing 
You’re essentially ghosting her and that isn’t cool at all think about how you’d feel if someone you considered a close friend treated you the same way 
If I thought 10 of my friends were my friends but actually they werent bro that would break my soul and I’d be insecure and self conscious for the rest of my damn life 
You need to be honest with her and tell her EVERYTHING but I cannot emphasise enough you must do it in a kind manner!!"
d5hhqi,NTA If your cat is cool on a leash and harness (which always makes me laugh when I see my neighbours walking their cats on them) then I don't see the issue. Maybe the dog owners need to have more control over theirs?
d5hi12,[removed]
d5hp38,"> My gf, on the other hand, feels that since we have been together for a while and since she helped with my earlier move, she is entitled to me asking on her behalf. 

Nta, I was gravitating toward nah but her insistence on asking your family and emotionally manipulating you puts a bad taste. If your gf wants to do tic-for-tac then offer to help her in conjunction with HER family or movers.

YOUR family helped because they were helping YOU. She should not expect free labor from YOUR family. Her expectation makes her an asshole - it’s one thing for her to request that you ask your family and let them make their own decision but her insistence that they should help makes her the asshole."
d5hsmr,"NTA. Jesus as someone who is online a lot, I know what you mean- he was in the wrong friend circle and his behavior was way out of the game."

I probably would have taken the bible, walked a few paces, then dropped it into a garbage can, but towards these sidewalk preachers I'm an asshole."
d5hwf4,"ESH. You certainly have the right to ask her to leave, but ultimately you are fostering several unhealthy relationships. Chances are your relationship with your friend is ruined and you may or may not be interfering with your ex’s marriage. It’s not healthy to be in love with someone who is married (even if their marriage is not great).

You and your friend should take some time apart."
d5i0hw,YTA - Please stop policing your exe's dating life.
d5i6n6,NTA but I feel as if this sounds unsafe for your siblings. They sound like borderline alcoholics and their kids are getting sick all the time. Is there anything you could possibly do? Maybe call CPS?
d5icem,"YTA because you know she hates it and cries. Let her take her time with it, and don't force it, because she may resent you in future for forcing her and making these memories unhappy ones. She may pick it back up in time, she may not."

d5il9q,NTA. There are laws about paying wages at least in the US. You agreed on a wage and it should be paid!
d5im7x,"YTA: I'm sure most would disagree with me, but this isn't your brother in law's fault if it's ruining your relationship... It's you and your husband's, because you two clearly are having issues communicating with each other. You two haven't talked in two days over an issue with *laundry*? There's clearly something deeper here.

His brother received permission to do laundry from your husband. Unless you are 100% sole owner of that home, and you do not want your husband to consider this his home as well, then your husband gets to give permission to his brother... Your husband lives there as well. It's home as well.

You need to work on communication with your husband and setting boundaries. I think fighting over him doing laundry at your house once a week is so not worth it... But hey, you choose your battles.

\*Edit: Thank you for the gold!!"

d5j154,"YTA for being mad.  When you give somebody something, unless you discuss there being strings attached, it means it is no longer yours.

Moral of the story:  loan things out vs. give them away if you expect them back."
d5j8cu,"NTA: The fact is, she put your life in danger knowingly, and you are absolutely allowed to bring that up.

Not only should you never get in a car with her again, you honestly should consider trying to convince your girlfriend of the same...

By the way, you are allowed to report reckless drivers. Honestly, if you're this mad about it, you could call the non emergency hotline, give them her plate #, and let them at least have it on record. They can't do anything because there's no evidence, but at least if she ever gets pulled over for something, they can definitely take stronger action because there was already a report.

This lady needs her license suspended."

d5jb7v,"YTA if you don't even try to find a compromise. Just because technically they're not barking during quiet hours doesn't mean your neighbors are wrong not to want to be woken up at dawn every morning by them.

Obviously the noise of your dogs stands out against the rest of the neighborhood noise if they felt compelled to leave you a note."
d5jcjg,"YTA. Bigtime. She legit needs big sister advice and you just laugh in her face? Not cool. Everyone likes different things, just because you're uncomfortable with it doesn't give you the right to be a dick. She needs her big sister and you should be there for her."

d5jhub,YTA not a big one but you are kinda blowing this out of proportion. You didn't get hit and worrying about all that stuff is dumb because it's completely irrelevant now. It's like tripping over and then having and argument with your bf bc he didn't appreciate the fact that you could have impaled your head on a spike and died.
d5ji21,"NTA Holly is 18 and bullying a 7 year old. That’s just cruel and if her parents stand by that then they support bullying too. They can’t force you to reinvite them to the wedding.  When is Holly supposed to learn to not be a rude and taunting brat? She’s now an adult and still never learned. There are consequences to being an asshole to children as an adult. Death affects everyone differently and your kid has a right to be sensitive and take her time to grieve. It’s not the place for sick jokes for Holly’s entertainment.

Edit: 

Holly’s parents seem to be blind to how bratty and cruel she is. So OP seems to have tried to highlight their blindness because of why they feel Holly is so “special” or “miraculous” to them.

Holly is known to the family as the miracle baby and apparently can do no wrong in their parents eyes.  I’m not sure just repeatedly bitching how bratty Holly is would have gotten the point across  either. It’s OPs wedding. She can disinvite rude family who make fun of her child being sad over their pet dying. If death is a funny joke to Holly and her parents they shouldn’t act all up in arms that their fertility can never be spoken of. They have a kid. It’s not like they never did and OP was making fun of them. They’re also in their 60s. So the ship has long sailed for them birthing any more children. Holly’s parents were not being made fun of over fertility like Holly was making fun of a pet dying while video taping of all things."
d5jkzf,NTA you live next to some weird people
d5jm45,"NTA. Even if the boss said it's cool, you should have been notified if you were going to be opening and the alarm was going to be off.

d5ko3y,NTA. But maybe you should talk about it with your boss? Tell your boss that you and your coworker are friends and that you would find it preferable if he knew that he was going to let be let go as soon as possible. That way your friend can make realistic future plans. If you put it like that towards your boss you would not be/look like an asshole to either.
d5kpjg,"NTA: Your mom handled this really poorly, and the fact that she keeps talking about it is incredibly inappropriate.

On a side now however: As a person who hates my photo be taken as well, and even more so when I was your age, you very well make regret not having more memories later with your mom and photos are the best way to keep them. I'm 27 years old, and freshman year of high school (when I was 14) feels so far away now... I have memories, but not a ton. I wish I was more involved, and had more photos of that time."
d5ksct,"NTA.  You’re not even given a schedule in advance and you’re worried about not fulfilling their expectations?

Halloween weddings are a thing and they can't help your son was born on that day.

Joking aside, its weird to take showers that long ESPECIALLY when there is only one bathroom for 5 bedrooms. She's 18, still not fully mature, probably just upset she doesn't have more room for herself but she needs to check herself because what she's doing isn't ok."
d5mu9m,"NTA. You are her friend, not her caregiver. She knew what type of assistance she needs, yet refuses to allow you to get a caregiver for the trip. Adding things you don’t know about her needs at the last minute is so inappropriate.

Edit: my last sentence did not make sense 

And - She should have been straight from the beginning, unless she is deteriorating and now needs more help, in which point she should consult her doctor before going on a trip."

d5mwop,NAH you both have valid points.  You have to figure out together what works for your family.  But you also will have to sleep at some point.
d5n2pa,"NTA 

Get out nowwww"
d5n79f,"NTA. Life happens. You got a last minute offer, early in the day when it's cooler, and you took it. No further explanation needed."
d5n7b8,NTA. Under 18 is still considered child porn and this could end up biting you in the butt. Hurt feelings are better than jail time.
d5n8fb,"YTA. Airlines offer plenty of movies for watching that are not child appropriate. That doesn’t mean that doesn’t sitting in an aisle with a child shouldn’t watch them. It’s the parents’ job to parent, not your brother’s."
d5n90q,"NAH. You already got her several gifts. 

But, if you want to be polite in the future, try not to blow your load by sending everything to her door weeks ahead of time. Just show up with the gifts."
d5nazg,"NAH - But maybe don’t tell the relative! I think they’d be pretty offended, honestly."
d5neo8,NAH it wasn't intentional.
d5nj2z,NTA. Hell naw. If they tried that at a regular gym they'd be kicked out
d5nmls,NTA He probably couldn’t make eye contact because he didn’t want to escalate the situation. As an employee I never took sides in customer disputes because it could end very poorly. He might have been embarrassed by the attention but I can’t stand people who think they can say whatever they want because “customer service.”
d5np1x,ESH. You're really going to be mad at your girlfriend for finding a picture of her while you were looking at other girls? Get real. If her posting a faceless picture is considered cheating to you how is looking at pictures of other girls not?
d5ntav,"NTA. She's being ridiculous. She can either sit in the laundry and keep feeding the machine or she can lose the dryer.  

You're not her employee or maid."
d5nvqt,"YTA

You’re not actually a friend. A friend maybe has a laugh about it, but when he’s asked to stop, he stopped.

You said it’s your right and you’re gonna keep doing it. You’re not his friend."
d5nxpa," NTA

I am also from Toronto, but this happened visiting LA. A self promoting rapper was standing on a corner and shoved a CD in my hand, l walked away and he’s like “5 bucks”. You put it in my hand dumbass."
d5o63i,"NAH. As an American and someone who has dated Canadians, it’s pretty standard for the men to pay for the first date. Unless women insist on splitting. You also said goodbye so.... she didn’t run. You’ve already said you weren’t interested in a second date. You’d *would be* an asshole to tell her off. You should have discussed that before saying goodbye and using the bathroom."
d5o7eg,"NTA. Your mother wants to help, that's nice. She can deal with the fallout. Not your burden."
d5oa2a,"NTA.  Their logic is stupid.  The price for food should be computed per person in any normal scenario, which this is.

There were 5 people, each person's share is 1/5 of $150 or $30.

If the dudes are covering their wives, THEY should cover their wives and pay $60 each. Duh?

Your friends are being dumb, selfish, or both in this situation."
d5oifc,"I think as long as you recommendations are in line with a Doctor’s you are fine. But I also think you should recommend that she trust her doctor more. Because you are right, some of your info could be faulty or outdated even if you do try to research. But if your sister only listens to you then idk what to say. Do your best. NAH"
d5oj9m,"YTA

This is your sister's wedding & you're holding a grudge over a silly comment someone else made years ago? Let it go, already."
d5oxxq,"INFO 

I really have no idea what you're talking about."
d5oy5c,"ESH - You had your chance to say no when he literally asked you. It sounds like you were dropping hints the entire time rather than saying “I do not want him over, please tell him not today or go over to his place. I’m very sick and need my rest.”

But it also sounds like you dropped a LOT of hints. I think he should’ve got the gist from you that it was a bad idea. At the same time - he was probably looking forward to his friend coming over and had “tunnel vision” after he heard that “yes.” But still - he should’ve known from the get-go that having a friend over in a STUDIO apartment around someone that is sick wasn’t a good idea, no matter what."
d5p2mc,"NTA - your ""opinions"" aren't getting in the way of your friendship, her shitty boyfriend is."
d5p3o4,"This is hilarious, you’re not the asshole!"
d5p5ox,"YTA You have no right, legal or moral, to kick someone out of their own home because you don't like them. She is not your guest. Her right to be there is not dependent on your whims."
d5p64b,YTA. Literally everyone has to make an effort to remember what people in their lives have going on. Just put in a minimal amount of effort pal
d5p6r0,"I think tomorrow I will be the asshole and park further up so he can't get his van in front of me at all. Then when he knocks my door ill let him know that if he boxes me in again that I will park there every day. I don't mind giving a little to keep the peace but it's ridiculous, they take up most of the damn street"
d5p8mg,[deleted]
d5pamb,It doesnt matter he was using it. Hes right theres a perfectly good desktop to use. If she got mad it meant she was gonna use it for some other reason
d5pds4,"NTA. Why are you even in communication with this person? If they’re racist towards you, do you expect them to suddenly become a nice person? Ignore them, and this won’t be an issue."
d5ph9t,"NTA

She makes no sense. Don’t worry about it."
d5pi3b,NTA as long as you can let your friend know not to expect the extra guest.  Be prepared for relations to not be friendly anymore if you guys were getting along post break up until now
d5pj5o,"Oof, YTA. There’s a massive difference between sexually charged humor and joking about sexual assault. I’m not surprised he blocked you without wanting to hear any more from you. I think it’s best to just learn from this incident and move on- if you see him in person at these events you might have another opportunity to apologize. Otherwise, things like this do happen. Sometimes we say awful/cringy things that we regret. Even if he doesn’t want to speak to you anymore, you can still grow and start fresh with other people."
d5pme3,[deleted]
d5pp0o,I don’t think she’s using the word ‘trauma’ correctly.
d5pr7k,"NAH  
  
Get a necklace to put it on or one of those silicone rings to wear while you lift."
d5prnj,"I was thinking no A here, but then I got to the part where you got angry and accused her of lying. Procrastinating isn't lying.

You sound a bit volatile, not to mention controlling. I think YTA."
d5pshm,"NTA. She’s badly informed, refuses to listen to science or reasoning and refuses to investigate further. 

If she refuses, then she gets cut off. Do not let her expose your family to illness. She obviously doesn’t care enough about them to protect them."
d5psl2,"NTA, bad teeth can screw you up for life. Yeah, baby teeth fall out, but habits are frequently forever."
d5py3u,"NAH 
Your doing something that you like, and possibly love. What happened to your dad was a accident, and could have happened to anyone. Granted, it could happen to you and I get why your mother is concerned. But I think that you should follow what you love, but be careful while doing it. Also, bloody Aussies! Much love/hate from NZ"
d5pzzd,"NTA

it's hard to fathom how your parents could take this personally. You are totally in the right here. They are called boundaries and in healthy relationships they are honored."
d5q0vt,"NTA

Her crush. Her friends. On the complete opposite side of the city from anything actually convenient to you or your friends. No. This party is for her, not you. 

Hold your own party and definitely invite her."
d5q1ta,"Daycare placements aren't always something you can get last minute. If they take the kid out now, then when she finds a job it could be weeks before they can actually get the kid a spot. Taking a kid out of daycare during a short term employment gap isn't always a good idea if you can afford to keep them in. You could potentially lose out on opportunities if you can't start a new position right away. 

It's only been six weeks, that's not really very long for a professional job search."
d5q5e3,"NTA. It’s a shitty feeling only being told that you look nice when you have a bunch of products on your face making you look less like yourself.

You shouldn’t have to put up with judgmental and back-handed comments—and that’s absolutely not a “mom thing.” It’s a mean thing. 

Your husband is also being an asshole for not supporting you in this. He’s being ridiculous saying that you hate his family when it sounds like you’ve only expressed how upset you are about this with him."
d5qc85,"NTA you were protecting the closeted sibling at the table, and to be honest I don't think there are situations where calling out homophobia is an asshole move. More people need to speak up and/or scream at homophobes."
d5qdor,I really hope it’s Snugglebottom.
d5qhn6,"NTA. By her logic, if she was hosting she'd have to make an all vegan meal, right? Pretty sure that wouldn't ever happen. You're being kind enough letting her family live with you.

(Also, why the hell would anyone *want* meat cooked by a vegan? I haven't eaten it in 20+ years, do you think I have any idea how to make it well?)"
d5qjcy,"NTA- your acquaintance is being ridiculous. Half hour or more a day is way too much. Once a week is much more reasonable, and if she can’t deal with that, that’s too bad. You’ve got stuff to do, you’re busy, and if you want to do well you gotta cut out the things that stress you."
d5qkqv,"YTA - it would have taken you 5 minutes and getting a bit wet 🤷‍♀️ you weren't refusing to help the chicken, you were refusing to help your wife."
d5qlju,"NTA. Your mom is the one who violated a house rule, not you."
d5qq9a,"NAH, but it would probably be good for him to get used to other people looking after him, and for you to get used to that, too. You might not always be able to do it yourself."
d5qya1,"....ESH but really it's your boss who is TA.  Listen, report your boss to the appropriate labor board so that you can get your rest breaks.

The reason you're TA too is because you're putting this on your coworkers and not even taking the break that you're saying you're trying to get.  The rest break is supposed to be separate from the meal break, not combined into 1 long break that messes with them.  If you want to start enforcing your rights, take your rest break as a separate break and tell your boss to shove it when they give you shit about it, and encourage your coworkers to do the same.  Then everyone is equal and getting what they deserve.  Don't just screw them over by taking an extra long lunch."
d5r038,YTA. A smart person would have known what a stupid thing to say that was.
d5r6av,"NTA, I'm so sorry your dad is my dad's soulmate. Don't ever let him gaslight you into thinking you're unreasonable for wanting space and privacy. Pythons kill their prey by incrementally tightening every time you exhale, and so does this kind of father."
d5r78r,YTA - why is this your business to solve or get involved with?
d5r7dd,"ESH, but understandable.

Honestly though, if you're getting his bills I wouldn't be in AITA. I'd be going to r/legaladvice. It sounds like you need a lawyer."
d5r9xj,"NTA. Chronic pain is no joke. If her response is to handle pain as everyone else does, then just cut ties with her; she should just learn to handle the pain of separation as everyone else does."
d5rd3u,"I'd say make it clear that this invite is for her alone and I'd say NTA. Because most weddings have the implied +1 rule and it'd suck for him to show up at the wedding either have it be weird, but its your day. If you wanted to invite specific brothers you'd be fine, but once someone is there you've gotta be hospitable."
d5rea7,"NTA - I'm high functioning and sometimes we just need to be told, no this is not the right time at all. Directness can help."
d5rekx,"YTA.

I really think you need to seek out some therapy. Miscarriages are hard and no doubt you've been blaming yourself for years over them due to your health issues. Now a doctor has given you a target for you to blame and you've latched onto it wholeheartedly. And I get it. For the first time in who knows how long it's not ""your fault"". 

But two things really stand out. One, how you're handling things. You've found your target for your anger and all that pain and resentment is flashing to the surface. You pretended to call a funeral home to try and guilt your husband, for crying out loud. Because he's not jumping at throwing out his companion on the word of a doctor who has done literally nothing but talk to you and given you, possibly misguided, hope. 


Two, Reproductive Immunology is still a very poorly explored and understood medical specialism. Any doctor who says, ""Yep, *that's* the cause, right there!"" with little more than a consult is already suspect in my experience, and combined with its newness and already developing reputation as poor science, it makes me even more skeptical. I linked an article in another reply. Please read it."
d5rfot,NAH. You are not obligated to drive her. Her husband can figure something out for her. Be nice about it though.
d5rl75,"I’m going to say NAH. 
Have you ever hosted a guest before? Like... ever? You don’t ask guests to help clean up or contribute “to the running of the house”, MIL or not. That’s just plain rude.

However, yea, it’s extra work and tiresome. 3 weeks is a long stay. In my personal opinion, I’d suck it up and just do it."
d5rroi,"NTA. Don’t wait and leave ASAP. That’s bullshit that he took her to work so she “wouldn’t have to be home”? That’s a red flag, I don’t care they’re newlyweds, that’s fucking bizarre. Not letting you two have alone time is really really weird... get out of there."
d5rsyr,"NTA, but you need to tell him it’s a hard no for you. It would be a bizarre and immature dealbreaker, but if it is one for him you need to find that out now. Don’t wait till he’s moved to be with you and you’re pregnant.

I find it obnoxious that he’s insisting on a name for your child before you’ve even thought seriously about having one. Hopefully he cares what you think in other areas of life."
d5rumd,"NTA..however, $25/year insurance on a $300 ring is a rip off. Look for a different policy. Add to your renters or home owners policy if possible if you have either. Most policy’s cover up to $300 in jewelry with no extra $ or policy addition. 

I know that’s not what your post was about, but that stuck out to me."
d5rwmw,"NTA they're responsible for their child and for the damage he causes. If they were renting and the child damaged something in the home, they'd have to pay for it. It sucks but it comes with having a child."
d5rx1h,Eh YTA. It's not like she's too young for your dad. Your dad himself is only 17 years older than you. You will eventually need to get over this.
d5rzqm,"NTA, maybe just a poor decision."
d5s0zy,"NTA. Your husband not religious and you have bad memories. The gift may have been a “Oh crap, I wasn’t even thinking.” Kind of gift. But at the same time, your MIL is also trying to shove religion down you and your husbands throat whilst also knowing both of your opinions and past. So at best, it’s an unfortunate accident; at worst, it’s a insensitive gift with malicious intent."
d5s1z9,"ESH. It's a dick move for drivers to block the intersection but, like with drivers, you shouldn't initiate unnecessary confrontations in traffic because that's just always a bad plan"
d5s2vg,NTA. A month is a suspiciously long time to ship something. You can pay them again if the samples arrive.
d5s3na,Banned for criticizing mods
d5s5g8,"NTA 

I mean it’s good to let a person vent for a little with their troubles. But at a certain point what’s done is done and complaining is just a waste of time or worse yet it’s annoying. Since you weren’t playing the game and since there was nothing pleasant to stay for you left and that’s perfectly fine.

One thing I say to complainers is “I hear you and sympathize with your situation, but what are you going to do about it?” 

You’ll find that just saying that cuts right through everything. Life is about what you do. Not about what’s been done to you. It’s about how you respond. 

Either the person realizes that complaining is over and it’s time to start coming up with positive solutions or they get annoyed with you and you don’t have to deal with their negativity too long anyway since they’ll just paint you as uncaring in their mind and not want to spend time with you.

Let me be clear this will only serve to make positive people respect you and enjoy how you’re always making them see their own agency in life and also it will make negative people dislike you. And you don’t necessarily want negative people to like you. But they will all respect you."
d5s6im,YTA. Dude. You live in an earthquake prone area and you left a wheelbarrow full of rocks on a hill leading towards your neighbor’s house. This is about as much your fault as if you’d thrown them through the window.
d5scdw,Some people aren’t ok with certain things. I have some friends who won’t watch anything even vaguely associated with horror movies even though they are 30-40. I would defer to you to know how your family would feel about this but you seem to have a very casual attitude about it and I think I have to go YTA without more information because you convinced them to go see it and even though they clearly did not enjoy it you don’t seem to take responsibility for them seeing it.
d5sg9f,YTA for lying.  If he has slept with 40 then he would be a hypocrite if he didnt accept your 23.
d5sjr9,"Please seek legal counsel immediately to protect your children. They are old enough to decide if they want to see their father and you need to help them legally.

ETA: NTA for obeying your sons’ wishes"
d5slr2,YTA. The problem is it attracts wildlife to the road side which means more animals get hit by cars.
d5spnu,NTA. What the fuck? He doesn't own you. You work for him *once* a week! You are allowed to take other jobs! Jfc.
d5sq7g,"Lmao ""she said I was not a responsible adult and unfollowed me on instagram"""
d5sy6q,"NTA, but I think you probably already know that."
d5t051,NTA but you definitely should have made this agreement explicit to everyone in the group.
d5t0ir,NAH. Your fiancé should invite her to the stag party instead.
d5t0qc,ESH use communication. He is being rude but you have all the knowledge to know he doesn’t realize that. So yeah he is an asshole. But do you want to be right or do you want to get what you want?
d5t1e1,"NTA. As far as being a professional, making a joke about it - single most professional thing you could have done."
d5t1x1,"YTA for lying on Reddit about a fake allergy. Your symptoms are in no way associated with an avocado allergy. 

Shit post."
d5t24w,"NTA

I don't believe in calling dibs on names. That's ridiculous.

No one owns a frickin name. And if they love it so much, they can still name their future child that hadn't even been conceived yet that.

Also. For the future, stop discussing names with anyone period. Because then this likely would never have happened bc it could've been as easy as oh, I did not know you wanted to use that name. 

The other details of your relationship to me, aren't relevant.

The bottom line imo is that no one owns a name. The only time I think you can be like okay, maybe don't do that is if it was like, his name was John Smith III and you randomly decide you want to name your child John Smith IV just for funsies"
d5t2da,"NAH Living with someone is really hard. You need to sit down and both work out a compromise so that both of you feel comfortable with the living conditions. You should be prepared to BOTH make compromises. If this goes very badly, and you're very unhappy with the situation, seek support from the floor/building support person."
d5t3im,"NAH. It’s hard sometimes, but letting your job abuse you can get out of control. Everyone has a life and wants days off for self care and just whatever. You shouldn’t feel bad if you just can’t or just don’t want to do it."
d5t75c,"NTA

Your friend pushed the relationship farther than it could go and you did what was in your best interest by ending it. Her loss."
d5t9id,"NTA  
Smartphones are the standard nowadays. Senior citizens who can't figure out how to get them to work use flip phones. You might as well be using a walkie-talkie.  
There is no way to do what your parents are asking you to do in order to ""earn"" this phone. As you pointed out, the school you go to has high standards. I wouldn't expect an average High School student to take on that many responsibilities and still keep her room spotless, care for dogs, etc.   
Your parents are asking too much.

Edit: spelling"
d5tc1l,"YTA. Especially if your friend doesn’t participate in the trash talking. Your friend doesn’t like it and expressed so. Continuing to do so makes you a bully, and all of your other friends for that matter.

Edit: reread the post and if he does participate then NTA, gotta be able to take it if you dish it out."
d5tdxd,ESH but you're the asshole we need.
d5tgvd,"NTA. Your mother said you should set it aside to be more responsible, meaning saving it. The fact she turned it around into a new rent payment is kind of buildshit in itself. If they wanted more from you, they should confront you about it, not trick you out of your money."
d5tl5k,NTA. How old are you? I am just wondering why you are still in contact with your mother. Obviously a relationship with her is not in your best interest.
d5tn19,"NAH, you obviously didn't mean to speak her like you're talking to a dog and it can be hard to know how to interact with disabilities. Your aunt got understandably angry though.

maybe ask your aunt how you should interact with her? (this could potentially come off the wrong way so make sure she knows you mean well). tell her you'd like to know for future reference."
d5tw1g,YTA.  Kids are not a thing you should EVER hide from a partner.  Your ex is a prick for putting you in that situation though.
d5u94p,"YTA for sure.  Not only is it extremely bad manners, it kills the grass and stinks.   I had to spend a lot of money putting up a fence to stop this behaviour from rude dog owners."
d5u97n,"NTA. I think you should continue to do homework, however, you need to somehow show your mother (maybe through studies you could find online) how harmful being brought up with no privacy like that can be to a child's mental health. It takes a negative toll."
d5ub4b,"NTA.  If she is rude to you and causes problems, why would you want to spend extra time with her?..... Exactly, you wouldn't. Dont feel bad or guilty for wanting to have a good time with friends and the girl you want to get to know better.

Also, she overheard the convo, so she invited herself, which is a huge no."

d5uo9j,"ESH


You're both acting like children, (probably because you are children, by the sounds of it). Your joke was stupid and I can see why it might have made him feel bullied. He sucks for obvious reasons."
d5urbs,"YTA - it’s a vape, not crack. What’s the big deal exactly? You seem very dramatic."
d5uu7t,"NTA, your dad is a shit and your mom is an enabeler.
That interaction made my skin crawl.

Mom :""its a shame she's crying since its her graduation""

Dad:""dont you fucking blame that on me""

You should check out r/raisedbynarcissists
They sound like they fit right in. 

YNTA, and i'm happy you have a boyfriend as wonderful as this.

Congratulations on graduating op! Time to move the hell away from these leaking sphincters."
d5uu9d,"NTA. Giving gifts does not confer ownership.  It sounds like he's trying to buy a guilt rope around you.  He's going to learn sooner or later this doesn't usually work, might as well be with you."
d5uuha,NTA Sacrifice a goat at her funeral.
d5uvoa,"YTA


She's seven. Even though she asked for your opinion, I think it's stupid not to moderate it considering that she's *seven*.


Her parents are the ones organising this, not her, and all you've done is make her feel like all her classmates will think she's a greedy-present grabber. If her parents had been the ones asking for your opinion and you said this, I wouldn't think twice about judging N_T_A, but she's a young kid!


She's seven ffs. It's your responsibility as her uncle/aunt to make her feel better and *less* weird, not worse, and not to 'tell it like it is'. 


You could have still given your opinion without potentially making her feel bad: *""It's certainly unusual, but it's going to be great fun!*"""
d5v1c9,YTA. That’s really insensitive of you and I think you should just scrap the tattoo idea. It’s like saying “ I only care about my LIVING nieces “. I know it’s not the intention but stil.
d5vbv7,"NTA, the hospital should be help accountable for their mistakes."
d5vgpc,"NTA. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it an actual health hazard (in a hospital specifically) to leave food out like that?

I'm used to NHS hospitals where there's a big emphasis on keeping everything as sterile as possible to avoid infections spreading and whatnot."
d5vkn5,"NTA going against the grain. I use the following sentence all the time on this sub- if someone is upset about something small, they are probably upset about something else. It sounds like you’ve got some self-esteem issues. I get it. Feeling like someone thinks I’m dumb or misunderstanding me is very upsetting to me. I’m not saying you’re crazy or anything, but therapy is good for everyone and has helped me with esteem issues specifically. Based on my history, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was someone in your past that made the joke and it stuck in your subconscious. Bark up that tree.

I specifically didn’t say no AH because I don’t like lame jokes, and that joke is just barely funnier than Jeff Dunham."
d5vl6n,"NTA. Do not “babysit” that kid again.  The fact that Mom wasn’t the least bit bothered that her son tried to kill your cat...you’re not an asshole, they are - the both of them."
d5vqif,"NTA. Before reading the last part I was ready to call you the asshole, because I expected you not wanting to pay anything and not taking responsibility at all. However, paying half is exactly how it should be. You were both at fault, so you share the costs. The guy that payed can get half of you and half of the guy (his brother) who tackled you. Give him the 20 bucks and tell him to sort out the rest with his brother."
d5vwn9,"NTA, but before you give them a solid yes/ no, it might be beneficial to let them know why you’re hesitant to say yes and see if there’s a compromise."
d5vxga,"NAH. You now learned that this can be an issue, so I suggest looking for affordable options to provide the animations in the future (possibly put together on a different device). There has got to be something open source out there nowadays?"
d5vyu6,"NAH You should still still him. But honestly, wait until the estate is settled. If it’s been 10 years since seeing him and 6 years since contacting, there’s no rush."
d5w11u,NTA honesty is the best policy. Especially when some fuckface is spreading lies to make themselves look good.
d5w2pf,"NTA, your car, your rules. And you didn't ask her to be insured for her car.
Talk with her about it but don't tell her she's a terrible driver, maybe tell her she needs to be more careful while driving, because you want her to be safe"
d5w3kl,"NTA

 Not really sure how you could be considered to be an asshole for doing this.

Are you more so concerned that the cost the couple is spending per plate will be burned on someone they don't know? Because, behaviorally I'm not really sure what the problem here would be."
d5w6mp,"NTA - sounds like your in-laws have zero respect for you in ANY situation, and this is just an extension of that.  Even if they are the grandparents, as the father what you say should be respected by them. Sounds like you and your wife are on the same page, so maybe she needs to have a chat with her parents and explain that it’s not okay for them to undermine what you say, but then listen when she says the exact same thing. They are acting like children who didn’t get their way."
d5w8wo,"NTA

But I'm also an author. Is it not possible to completely eliminate anything that might be identifiable as you too?"
d5waj8,YTA. If you were tied to the bathroom then you could have filled the tub and put the pants in to soak. Honestly the last thing I would do is put them outside. Of course they will get ruined that way.

d5xebt,"NTA. The manager is being deeply insensitive and compromising the safety of her workers. Most workers (especially women) wear a fake name on their tag to keep people from targeting and stalking them. Which is why it’s pretty much universally allowed. Tell your manager she’s compromising her workers’ safety. If she doesn’t get it after that, I’d let the other managers know what’s going on.

Not to mention that her reasoning is basically that she doesn’t want to bother learning her employees’ names, which is extremely entitled and offensive. She shouldn’t be a manager."
d5xf48,Esh he is right; you should never let out someone's room without asking.  But personal disputes don't absolve him from needing to pay bills.

The UK can generally have a really shitty attitude towards learning other languages. There's this idea that we shouldn't need to bother learning other languages because: *'everyone speaks English anyway'*, yet there are people that hear immigrants speaking their native language together and will shout at them to 'speak English'. 


I'm not saying that your neighbours *are* this kind of xenophobe with a double-standard, but it seems like common sense to just learn the language if you're going to live there. You shouldn't have to act as their personal translator because they're too lazy to learn something so important.

I'm glad you feel good about starting to stand up for yourself. Run with it. There's literally nothing to feel guilty about. 

Now it's time to sit down with her and have an adult conversation when you're both not so heated. Let her know that you're both clearly adapting to living with one another and that boundaries need to be set to avoid future problems.

Tell her you'll find a way to shift to take up only your 50% barring the food you share. Also set up a rule that dishes can't be left overnight. You're both busy. She can delay going to her boyfriend's place by 20 minutes."

>The school offers busing. But at $2,500/yr/child, it’s not affordable for us.

Found the reason they don't want you using other services!

Edit: $2,500 per kid per year, for 180 school days, assuming morning and afternoon service comes to about $7 per kid per trip. Assuming about 30-60 kids per bus that's $210-$420 per route. That's a lucrative business!"
d5xno5,"YTA- I don’t think you’re an asshole necessarily, but for all purposes of this post you are in the wrong. You need to inform HR about your living arrangements ASAP. I don’t think having a completely platonic living arrangement with a coworker who doesn’t directly report to you is a big deal, but by keeping it this huge secret makes it into a bigger deal than it is. And people WILL find out about it.
Also, if you all are splitting rent 50/50, then he has a right to allow his significant other to come over. If this is really that much of an issue, I’d recommend you find another living arrangement and someone else to take over your lease. Because it is unfair to your roommate."

YTA for coming to reddit and asking if you’re right or wrong about something that’s deeply upsetting for her and not just sitting down and having a conversation with her. Working on it to sell it faster? That’s not an appropriate response to the breakdown she had. That’s you focusing on the car and NOT your marriage. The car isn’t the point.

Go TALK to her and find out how she’s doing instead of categorically dismissing her as sullen and then doing what you want anyway. Does she actually want you to get rid of it? Or is she fine with you doing what you need to and also needs some comfort right now? Does she need to talk about her brother, who you clearly don’t know much about and haven’t asked about in the whole time you’ve been together?  Does she think you don’t give a shit about her loss or sadness and this is just another example of it? Was this type of car one of his favorites and that makes it even more painful? You don’t have any information because you aren’t TALKING TO YOUR WIFE and asking her about her grief, and her brother. That’s what makes YTA. Not because of keeping a car that reminds her of her brother’s death. It’s never that two dimensional with grief. 

Lean in, not away, dude, as fast as you can, before you end up with a bigger problem here."

d5ztoa,"YTA

Short answer, yes. 

That being said, it's not like I lack empathy for your situation. You're in a bit of a bind. You're choosing fear instead of your relationship. I don't even judge you for that. But if you're not strong enough to stand up to your parents in such a huge time of need for your SO, is he really that important? Probably not.

Maybe you should consider breaking it off with him or really anyone until you're in more of a position to stand up for yourself and the relationships you're in."

I'd say I know because I'm going through the same thing with my SO but I don't know all the details, I just know that it's draining to be around someone that has depression and having a relationship is difficult.

Thankfully, my SO understands this and she does what she can to talk about what she needs to but also share in common interests and hobbies without bringing it up.

You've done what you can and at this point it's up to your friend on how they will react."

d60dyh,"NTA, your friend is inconsiderate of your time and your feelings. I absolutely DESPISE people who are chronically late without good reason. It doesn't take much to be on time and to plan. Being all dressed and waiting for hours is the worst feeling and they should be more considerate. 

It's immature and rude to tell someone ""I will be there at x time"" and then intentionally throw that out the window and expect everyone else to be on your schedule. If they get offended, that's on them. They obviously don't care about how you may feel in these situations"
d60fd2,"I'd consider moving this to r/relationship_advice, you might get more appropriate feedback over there.

Talk!!! This (or something similar) ruined my relationship a week ago.

I was the one without the libido and she was fine with it. In reality I didn’t make enough effort and she wasn’t fine with it.

But please, for the love of god, talk about it! We’ve avoided the issue for too long and now..well..there is no relationship.

You will never be an A for changing how you feel. It’s just how you feel and therefore have the right to change your mind.


Of course there are feelings that can be controlled- agression, stress and so on. But this isn’t one of it.


Talk to him, explain, don’t let him shrug it off, make him to make time for sex. 

Sorry to be so blunt, but it just happened to me and I don’t want others to make the same mistake as we did.


Good luck."

1) It's a shitty gift.

2) It's statedly not for both of them

3) It looks like you didn't give a shit when picking out the gift, because you didn't. That's why you didn't realize you got them a gift only your dad can use."

It’s been discussed with her multiple times by multiple different people and she hasn’t done anything about. If anything she should be thanking you for cleaning since she obviously had no plans on doing it. I would agree that it does sound a bit like hoarding, and I do want to mention that that is a mental disorder and she may want to look into therapy. Having the house cleaned without her permission if she is a hoarder can cause intense distress and it sounds like it did. 

It sounds like what would benefit everyone involved is if she sought out some help to deal with this hoarding problem issue she’s having. However, if she’s not willing to take steps to help herself or you guys, then she is definitely the asshole."

Even small dogs need to be walked daily, or close to daily, even if you have a yard. They need mental stimulation and interaction with a range of different experiences. Being in the same yard every day is no different to us being in a big house all day. It's not great for us, not great for them.

They also adjust the table when you flip back to front and that takes another minute or two, and them putting warm wash clothes on your hands/feet.

d64xmh,"NTA, you told him about the problem and he didn’t take you seriously. Maybe you could’ve taken it to a shop to get it checked out but it’s partially his fault for not taking your concern seriously"
d64y73,"You're not wrong for being alarmed--that was a hugely dangerous thing she did.

YTA, though, because your reaction to hearing that your gf was in a dangerous situation is to be angry at her (??) and go straight to calling her a fucking idiot on the internet instead of being, idk, concerned. Revisit your priorities."
d653un,NTA but the customers who had blatant disrespect for the bathrooms at your work are the ones who ruined it for everyone else.
d654fg,"YTA.  If your daughter is ""killing it"" and getting straight As, one day out of school is not going to change that.  You're using this one day as an excuse to express your negative judgment of your ex.  It's petty and you're being an ass to try to cloak it in concern for your daughter."
d6595c,"NTA seriously 

You did exactly what I was going to tell you to do. Compromise and put it in the middle of your preferred temps. Now she’s the one being completely unreasonable. 

What is she wearing? Is she walking around in booty shorts complaining she’s cold? Or is she already wearing pants and a sweater? I get it. Get cold pretty easily. I also just put on slippers and a sweater because others like the house to be cooler. I sleep better like that anyway."
d65oen,NTA. If you have extra time at the end of lessons to do your homework then do it!
d65qlk,"You’re NTA, but neither is Katie. Ryan is. I understand why you would feel uncomfortable standing up at the wedding. And her email was... odd. But it’s her impending marriage, not yours. It’s her relationship. 

Is this the first time he’s cheated? Probably not. Did you do the right thing by telling her? Absolutely. Katie is a victim of Ryan’s cheating. I’m sure he’s very manipulative to get her to stay after all this. Blaming it on cold feet, really? 

That being said, I can see why she’d be very hurt that a lifelong friend would back out of the wedding. I would suck it up and stand up there with a smile. And then probably either get really drunk at the reception or dip out super early (or both!)."
d65ysb,"NTA if you were to go through with it.   If these were close friends, you might handle it a bit differently but since it's just a roommate and his gal, it's more like an act of kindness by an impartial Samaritan.   Sometimes getting called out like this can help a person understand that their actions carry consequence and perhaps even result in the perpetrator turning over a new leaf; infinitesimally improving humanity ftw."
d660i5,"NTA - Call Child Protection Services. What your parents are doing is Sexual Assault

>I remember my mom making baby voices and wanting to (and sometimes managing to) touch my grey/sexual area and slapping my butt.

This is terrible. THEY chose to have you, not the other way around. They should've raised you better or at least let you live in an adequate home."
d660ju,"Yes! 100% the part about not knowing if they're sick or disabled or something. 

A few years ago I was at my brother's graduation with my elderly grandparents and when the graduates walked in the people in front of us stood up. After a minute my grandfather, who had parts of both feet removed due to gangrene, asked them to sit down. They absolutely  FREAKED OUT. Acted like it was the most ridiculous request ever!

Moral of the story: You don't know why someone is sitting, try not to block their view."

d66ci8,"YTA for saying ""we would like to move forward in the process,"" when the original process was obviously over and done with months ago.

Didn't you previously tell her that you had hired someone else and that she didn't get the job?  If so, then you should have said that another position had opened up and you wanted to see if she might be interested."
d66dse,"NAH.

You would prefer to not be reminded of it all the time.

She would prefer you be safe."
d66it9,"I think this is a sign that you're complaining about your work too much. Your wife expressed herself terribly, but I will say this may be an ESH."
d66l6b,"ESH. Most people don't expect to be kicked out after 5 months. Unfortunately, you did specify that it could be at any time. You and friend really need to budget to save enough money that something like this doesn't interrupt other people's lives. Guess now you'll learn the hard way when you have to evict them."
d66omn,NTA. If they are commuting with you every day they should contribute to gas. It's common courtesy.
d66prw,YTA - That’s definitely only the parent or caretaker’s job. It is pretty rude to ask a total stranger’s toddler to say “please” first.

d67044,"NTA. If you really want to, tell him he has one last chance to treat you respectfully otherwise cut him. You don't need that crap. You don't owe him anything just because you've known him for years."
d671oo,"NTA for not supporting her car decision 

You are, however, not a great partner for focusing on the car and not outright telling her that you’re worried about financial imbalance in the relationship and are starting to have some resentment. 

If you modify this post a little, you can send it to her with an explanation that it’s NOT about the car (because it isn’t), it’s about your total financial picture and you feeling more burdened with your SHARED costs. You feel like she gets shiny, new things and you have to pick up the other costs (and might pick up these costs too). 

It’s might be to stop looking at it as “she makes 45k and I make 85k”, and to start looking at it as “we make 130k, how do we use our finances responsibly and split our shared costs fairly”. But that’s not for every partnership.

EDIT: and furthermore, it’s not JUST her decision anymore unless she chooses to start paying equal parts of household expenses and will cover the car on her own."
d672od,"YTA- she’s not giving up your time to go fuck other guys. She’s saving money and making herself available for work. Unless you’re going to start paying her bills, you’re being a huge needy asshole."
d677ti,"Sorry, but YTA. If you're getting the 250$ anyway, why should you care? It's your sister who is dating him, not you. You needn't be in love with someone who buys something from you. It's a matter of pure exchange of goods for cash, unless I'm missing something here."
d67bzu,NTA. Honestly your mom kind of sounds like the asshole.
d67ckd,"NTA. There is a spare room and someone needing it. Could you compromise? When your parents visit, you and your sis bunk together. When they aren’t there, you get privacy. Seems like a win-win to me."
d67d7a,"NTA.

She can refund the tickets for any reason, and she still thinks you're an asshole for cancelling when you *can't afford it?* She's definitely the asshole."
d67da9,"NTA -- at this point ... but would be if you give her place away based on what that guy wants. In fact, discrimination is at play here if you give her spot away due to her blindness (I'm assuming this is a public college). I believe you may have a responsibility to cater to her. And besides, isn't your club for those who are less active?

Since you're going, I'd recommend letting her come but hiking/camping with her; let the other part of the group do its thing. If she's down to trying something beyond smooth paths, help her out. Maybe another group member would be willing to join you two, too."
d67k6p,"First, you are putting the cart before the horse, she hasn't been fired yet, and if this is an isolated incident, she may not be fired.  Second, if you do allow her to stay with you, you may be inviting more problems than you realize.  You may end up with someone who never leaves, doesn't contribute financially even when they can, etc.  Being charitable does not mean putting yourself, your sanity, and your financial well being at risk.  NTA."
d67mmu,"NTA

Restaurant bathrooms are NOT for getting ready. Touching up make-up, sure. But getting ready from start to finish, absolutely not. Especially in a small bathroom. I worked in a restaurant when I was younger and there were times that I went out with friends after my shift. I would change in the stall and if I had to do a quick make-up touch up, I would do it at the sink. However, if a full make-up job was needed to be done, then I would either do it in my car or stop at home. Never perfume in the bathroom; outside in the parking lot, sure."
d67msv,"NTA.
The people who are going with YTA  are actually blowing my mind right now.

People need to make concessions in shared living situations, but you literally foresaw this problem and offered a preemptive solution which was turned down on several occasions..
It’s your god damn TV. Had he specifically mentioned that he was having friends over to watch your TV then you may have been TA for not letting him know that you intended on using it that night. 
With that said, I can’t help but feeling there isn’t enough info. They cussed you out after you offered another alternative? 

If everything you said is true then absolutely NTA imo."
d67pl4,"NTA. You quit and that meant going forward. 

She sounds like well you know."
d67qjg,"The thing that worries me is that your child’s mother is complaining about spending this time with them. It worries me how she may treat the child because of resentment of you being gone , while most mothers would be stoked, this one unfortunately seems selfish and possibly neglectful. 

If you think this will be an awful situation for your child then I wouldn’t go, doesn’t make you an asshole it just means to look at how this will effect your child, staying with a mother who doesn’t want them there. Your child comes first so really look at the situation NTA"
d67tde,"ESH.

She was being inconsiderate and rude, you were equally rude and OBVIOUSLY stealing her stop was a dick move.

d68551,NTA but you should stop apologizing for misunderstandings that are perfectly reasonable.
d68asz,"NTA. You're doing your boyfriend a favor by taking time off work and cashing out to go on a vacation with him for *his* friend's wedding. He needs to compromise on the locations. Anyway, why does the engaged friend want to hang out with his bros? Shouldn't he be focusing on his fiancee and honeymoon?"
d68cn4,"NTA. You gave a me a solid laugh. Marry who you want to, and don't settle for less."
d68d0h,NTA at all. My mom acts like that. But even then shed just wait for me to text her. Especially if I warned her about possibly being late.
d68dhs,"She doesn't want you to get high, because she'll get less attention..? NTA."
d68gfj,"NTA. This is just drama. You picked the girl cause they were being bitchy. Next time tho, just show up with her."
d68j9t,"NTA. It’s common courtesy not to do laundry at that time of night if it will wake people up, regardless of whether they have to come through your room or not (but having to come through there makes it worse). From what I understand, it’s common in apartment buildings and hotels to limit use of washing and drying facilities after certain hours so it doesn’t wake up the people that are in the rooms nearby. 

I’m not sure if you’re a guy or a girl either, but if you’re a girl, there’s the added factor that you’re entitled to privacy from another guy traipsing through your room, brother or not. Actually having written that, even if you were a guy you deserve privacy, and I didn’t mean otherwise. But what if you wanted to get a self-sesh in or sleep in the nude or something. You just have no privacy in the night."
d68lkq,"ESH because you two don't know how to communicate, argue, or discuss things like adults; it seems.

The correct response to ""responsible chores not completed to partner's satisfaction"" is not ""what were you doing all day"" or ""now I have to redo it, this doesn't even count"" and definitely not ""you don't care about us at all"".

Similarly, the correct response to all of that is not ""letting it slide for over a year"", or ""boil over until you retaliate in kind"".

You're the asshole because you picked at and festered this particular wound until it exploded, a serious asshole move.

She's the asshole because escalating issues with chores and reciprocity into not caring about your family is a borderline abusive move.

You two need therapy immediately because these issues aren't going to resolve themselves magically and you two aren't going to learn how to have sensible arguments without some help from a professional; in the interim there are kids in the house exposed to your poor argumentative strategies taking lessons on how relationships work."

If you find the answer to this riddle PLEASE TELL ME."
d68zlq,"NTA. She sounds kinda jealous but you’re his cousin. It’s not like anything was going to happen either way, and now he’s siding with her because he wants to keep up the relationship. She’s being rude and I don’t think you’re in the wrong for trying to tell her to cut that shit out.

FINE. I think I'll suck it up and go. Thank you, I think your comment, in a rather painful fashion, helped me to be a better person.

I think I'll send some rent money to my mom this month despite her insistence I don't need to do it cos she loves me so much. I'm too old to freeload"
d69f0f,"NAH-You do have a valid reason to hate him, but by a lot of tokens, the kids are the only piece of your ex-wife that he tangibly has left. He did lose a wife, grieving is not going some finite easy path.

But again, you have a valid reason to hate him. He’s not your friend, and he doesn’t have to be. 

I do have to ask, how has he worn out his welcome?"
d69fyb,"NTA. There’s no reason for him to be dishonest with you. And honestly it doesn’t make sense why he can’t take $20 out of the $100. Plus if he had his books and college paid by your parents already, it’s odd he needs another book he didn’t know about, which they can also foot the bill. The only reason you’re close to being TA is saying you would and then saying no, but it’s your decision."

d6acbj,NTA - I’ve worked retail for over ten years and I absolutely loathed people who demanded to be let in early or came in 5 minutes before closing and made me stay late . With that said if a customer is already there has been made aware of clothing time and is clearly not buying anymore and can easily leave at closing time it doesent bother me . In fact I would take great pleasure in telling them to gtfo when we were officially closed . Ya sometimes it’s annoying but it’s my job and working hours are there for a reason ; 9 minutes means you have 9 minutes . If she would have reminded you at the ten min mark and then with 2 min left that would have been cool but to come and remind you every single minute is VERY obnoxious. Don’t listen to the other people op . A person finishing their coffee or whatever without purchasing anymore in no way prevents them from closing up and cleaning up . But what Starbucks closes at 6?
d6aeg9,">He would protest going to straight bars with us and became a drama queen, kind of like a girl.

YTA. This line is one of the few times in this post where we see an authentic look into what your conversations with him are actually like and not the fabricated, biased version of events you try to put forward.

It is understandable not to want to engage with a drug addict. But that's not what seems to be the issue here."
d6ajt2,NTA. You don't need to refund your friend for a text book he willingly purchased. Not your responsibility to make sure he has the book he wants.
d6arfg,"NTA.

These aren't the actions of a friend.

If asked about it by management definitely don't lie, and be willing to give them your friends contact info.

Your position is he came and started bothering you, then did something stupid with some other people.

d6bde8,"NAH. You don’t want to do it out of maybe upsetting your mate, she has all the right to wear what she wants. I don’t think your grandparents are arseholes either, they grew up in an era where showing too much wasn’t the norm, and it was probably so ingrained into them that only slutty/dirty people wear skimpy clothing, so might feel uncomfortable around her. I say don’t ask, let her wear what she wants to wear, hope it’s half modest if it’s a proper fancy sit down meal, and if your grandparents say anything just calmly explain that she is her own person and can wear what she likes. That times have moved on and she is wearing something that might be considered more appropriate nowadays. For example I’m sure when your grandparents grew up, bathing suits etc didn’t have to cover there ankles, but people about 100 years ago would have thought that it was a terrible thing to not cover fully when at the beach etc."
d6bdoi,"NTA they suck for having incest. Cousin sucks for cheating on his gf, aunt sucks because she’s supposed to be mature and above this and for having an affair with a taken man.

YTA. Has it occurred to you to [edit: uncivil remark] and PROTECT your daughter from the racists you are supposedly so against? Anti racism isn't popular in ""the community"" when you define that as white people of a certain age and class. It never has been and never will be. Dr King's dream wasn't to ask politely for people to be ""not exactly liberal but okay"", then give up and abandon black people and their white partners to the wolves if they say no.

> furious at both her *and* me

[edit: This is ultimately an avoidant desire.] You and the other white moderates are the jewel in their crown; they need to win your complicity before they expand their empire. You are the oil in their tanks; your [edit: uncivil adjective] actions fuel their advance. Do ""your daughter"" a favor and tell her you've chosen not to be a dad to her because it might affect your little popularity contest. She deserves to know the truth. Jamal deserves to know you place your little neighborhood pecking order above his safety and freedom, too.

Let's hear from Dr. King about the white moderate:

Letter from Birmingham Jail (excerpt)

By Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., 16 April 1963

""First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season.""

Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.""

You're not just ""not liberal"", OP. You are the enemy of [edit: antiracists]. [edit: uncivil suggestion.] Be a [edit: swearing should probably go too, given the tone] DAD. Get your [attitude] together before you get someone seriously hurt with your wishy-washy bull[crap]. Be part of the solution or get out of the way. And might I add, your parents are who Dr. King meant by ""White Citizen's Council-er"". How many black people did they attack at soda fountains and city halls? How many have they intimidated out of their neighborhood? Have you even asked? Ball's in your court, [TAH]."
d6ciii,"Very easily NTA. He is abusing your hospitality. You're good friends, and that's great, but that doesn't mean he has permission to take your car without your permission. Worse yet, drinking and smoking weed in it? Hell no. That puts *you* in a bad position if you ever get pulled over, the smell of weed is unbelievably hard to get out of a car. Everyone is going to think it's you. You are so very not in the wrong here, you're doing the right thing both by standing up to your friend and by preventing a drunk and/or high driver from being a menace on the road."
d6ck42,"NTA - unfortunately most people don’t care about something unless it impacts them directly. I think this is a clean, simple solution.

Why is he your friend if he’s a transphobic?"
d6cmve,"Nah, he knows you'll be busy. Sometimes you just want to sleep next to you partner. It will also be good practice for when you 2 start living together. There will be busy and stressful days, and figuring out how to navigate them together is smart.

Just make sure you don't feel guilty by ignoring him while you get work done. And just relax and hope he can pamper you on the little time you have at home!"

He on the other hand has shown that he isn’t willing to respect boundaries you set - thus making it well within your rights to just ghost that dude for safety reasons (which you didn‘t even do by the way, just keeping the boundary you explicitly stated, which is „let‘s stop talking here“)."

d6d5gc,"Definitely NTA. She sounds like a narcissist. If it's not about her, she's not interested. She needs to be the best at everything, she needs to have it worse than anyone else. Any and all evidence to the contrary is denied or ignored. I had a boyfriend like that a few years ago and it's goddamn infuriating."
d6dl15,"YTA. If you just want me to comment on your interactions between you and the friend who will not pick a side then I believe you are being an asshole. She isn't being morally ambiguous, shes remaining objectively neutral. Whatever has gone on between you and this other friend doesn't concern her and that's why she isn't picking sides. Her friendship with either of you is not determined by the drama unfolding between other people. She sounds like a good friend to me."

ESH because proper etiquette wasn't followed at all. Friends usually reach out and talk to each other when there are tough times.

YTA because you could've mended this gap and been a bigger person by talking to your friend about it instead of ignoring them in their time of need. Treat others as you want them to treat you. 

If your dad was in the hospital over the weekend and their mom was just admitted, their mom could have been having issues over the weekend as well. People miss social cues in texts or get occupied doing other things. Your friend may have just been dealing with their mom. Maybe your friend isn't as close as you think. The only way to find out would be to talk to them."

d6e552,"YTA if you dont help contribute, you were using her laptop and she trusted you with the care of it, and your negligence led to the incident occurring.  And hes offering to only make you pay 1/5th of the repair.  You should take that offer because I feel like you should owe more and hes giving you a pretty sweet deal on this one."
d6ea3y,NAH. Nothing wrong with coworker asking and nothing wrong with you declining.
d6ee8d,"ESH. 

Look, she definitely sucks for doing that, but also ... a kitchen in the bedroom?!! Wut?! The bedroom is a place for sleep and relaxation (and sex, obviously lol), not to have big electrical appliances like a fridge running or cooking splatter all over the wall or bacon grease in your sheets. Maybe that’s your thing, but yeah I wouldn’t be happy if my partner did that. Unless you live in a caravan where you don’t get much choice, but even then, caravans designed for living in for longer periods have separate areas. Longing for years for a kitchen in your bedroom kinda sounds like maybe there are some deep-seated issues there you might want to explore (not saying that in a mean way - I have issues surrounding food myself because of childhood yada yada).

She shouldn’t have thrown your stuff out the window though. That is a violent act. Maybe she was at wit’s end for other reasons too, I dunno, but yeah it’s not cool."
d6ee9w,"NTA.  All fees must be agreed to **before** any transaction.  If they failed to mention them, or spell it out on their site, they just got $25 worth of business advice.  They may keep them but I'd report them stolen and leave reviews online."
d6eebj,"NAH. You violated your lease (bad OP, don't do that). She reported you. She's violating her lease. You report her. There are no assholes here, as you were/are both violating your leases."
d6eh8p,Nta but you should all do it together. Combined front and all stay strong intervention style otherwise I doubt the point will get across and she'll just hate one of you and nothing will get done. It sounds like itll be confrontation regardless though
d6ehmo,"NAH.

Your father set you up for success. You want independence but you want to also see that hes not alone. 

Maybe look toward moving him out with you? A new country could give him some new thoughts and insights."
d6eiu3,NTA.  I’ve had friends become infatuated with their girlfriends to the point they become MIA for a good part of a year.  I don’t blame you for not wanting to go if your younger brother acts this way.
d6el3h,"NTA, just Kindly say ""I'm not into politics, can you please stop sending me these."" And if she gets upset or still does it, block her. Easy peasy."
d6elil,"NTA, getting your hair and makeup done for a wedding is pretty normal, formal or not. I've been to alot of weddings where guests got done up because they wanted to respect the event. If the Bride didn't feel the need to not get her hair and make-up professional done that's on her and her choice. She can't ask people to look ""less than"" her."
d6eov6,"Yta,
If he's trying to get on his feet and be positive then making 300 buck legally in a weekend was probably a achievement for him.

All you did was try to tear him down because your bitter your ""help"" hasn't been paid back in what you'd deem the proper way."
d6epcm,"YTA. What was the joke? ""Haha you just got done work and now you have no food because I'm inconsiderate!  Just kidding!"" Best case scenario, she goes from mad/sad to neutral because there actually was food. At no point could this ""joke"" have brought her any joy or positivity."
d6eqde,"NAH: You guys need to talk it out, I dont think his issue is actually about laundry and keys but more so a general sense of respect.  You are only getting the complaints he's giving you, which in a bubble seem like overreactions.  Some people are wired differently and feel like some things that while arent important to you, are important to them.  If hes letting you stay at his home, Id probably just add the key and be done with it."
d6eqjc,"YTA, but only because that is dangerous. God gave us middle fingers for a reason."
d6erhk,"NTA - a father is just as responsible for taking his child swimming as a mother, good grief."
d6evz9,"NAH- what your girlfriend is going through is personal, and you do not have to share it with your mom"
d6ez1f,"YTA. It's important for your cousin to have someone to talk to about these things, particularly as he's at an age where he's going to become more sexually active."
d6f07l,"NTA. This is between your mom and your dad.  You never asked to be in the middle of it. Tell your stepmom that you refuse to play messenger between anyone, and if she has a message for your mom she can send it herself."
d6f1ee,NTA... He didn’t buy the tickets for the agreed upon date so that should be his problem not yours
d6f3n3,"YTA: You didnt do dishes for whatever reason, it became enough of a problem they felt they needed to discuss it with you, and instead of facing the problem you asked for a month of alone time? They are trying to show that the problem they had with you is not enough to ruin a living situation over, where you are happily prepared to nuke it out of spite.  Just do your dishes and say hi to them dude, its not hard."
d6fd00,"NTA - she's your mother, you clearly care about her and want what's best for her.

As for her fiancee, he's don't nothing to give you reason to trust him so why should you, until he gives good reason to stick with your stance.

Your mum isn't being an asshole however it seems she's being very naive about the whole situation. Just make sure you're there for her when things go south as they surely will and try dissuade her from making any rash decisions or linking finances etc with him if she won't listen about not getting back with him."
d6fl3e,"NTA, in my opinion. How dare you not adhere to social and societal norms of cooking dinner for the man in your life, don’t you know men can’t cook and will starve without a woman?

Jkjkjk but seriously. Maybe start cooking together when he comes home? I know writing gets you in a solid groove, but making this a shared activity is a great way to unwind, talk, and interact. Maybe he starts cutting up ingredients while you finish a paragraph. That way the “burden” is shared and there no guilt either. Everyone cooks, everyone cleans, everyone dries and put away the pots and pans."
d6fli6,"I kind of think NAH, but I think you’re right. It feels like your friend is not understanding the continued seriousness of the problems with Lee because he hasn’t shared in them himself. Mentioning with him how you avoided inviting certain people to make sure he’ll be comfortable/happy could be helpful?"
d6flyp,Nta. What is he doing in a music class if it’s so overwhelming?
d6fnn1,NTA. Why on Earth are you with this man? He sounds completely useless and ignorant of your feelings. Is there actually anything positive about him?
d6fq5x,"YTA. She's a one year old. Developmentally, she doesn't comprehend what you are trying to do. She literally cannot understand. At all. You're supposed to give infants what they want. He's being a good dad. You are not the dad, and as a babysitter your job is to take care of the kids per the parents instructions. She is not ""thinking things out"". What she is learning is ""When I'm upset, no one will help me"". You could be fucking with her attachment."
d6fs93,"NTA. Shit happens. Kids don’t stay within gated areas, and it’s not like you got high and fell asleep. You were cleaning the space she also lives in."
d6fvz7,"YTA but I think it was unintentional.  It was thoughtless to schedule an event that so obviously excluded one of your daughter's close friends; it was also hugely unprofessional of this business not to make sure they had a range of products and skills.  When the mistake was made, your response was pretty callous - sounds like an oh, well, I didn't know - here's some nail polish now shut up.  This was a hurtful thing and you could have done more to help Sara feel included at the time and then proactively talked to her mom about the issue."
d6fx0v,NAH. Your family should keep a doctor diary. Whoever brings him to the appointments can write down a summary in the book. It also helps you remember what you need to do (if the doc recommends stretches or something).
d6fz34,"NTA lack of prior planning on his part, does not constitute an emergency on your part."
d6g62z,"NTA. We should call in our friends and family when they are being creepy like that. Even if it was a joke, sounds like it didn’t land. If someone said that to me I would correct them immediately. You’re not an asshole for letting someone know they were weird to say that - as long as you’re not a jerk about it."
d6g736,"NTA

You're an adult and you have the right to privacy about your body and your health. Full stop."
d6gchu,"NTA, I have no doubt that this person came from money. Someone who didn't, would know better than to risk running up a bill that's in their name!"
d6ge1s,YTA. The point of headphones is to make the noise audible only to you.
d6gex2,"NAH, but I would talk to your boyfriend first about it to get his input and then bring up your points to your current roommate. She might be willing to compromise considering the situation. If she does, then the three of you should come together and discuss it. Establish some hard boundaries in the beginning.

But if you dont want to live with her regardless, you wouldn't be an asshole"
d6gg5x,"[r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/)

There are children involved, so I would figure out how to deal with this legally. Your kids should not go to the shelter with their mentally ill mother."
d6gj2y,NAH its just life
d6gmof,"NTA. You bought a ticket and made plans after confirming with him that he was going. He's definitely being TA.

Honestly, this man does not want to be friends with you. Maybe he's trying to piss you off so that you end the friendship first. He's not acting like a friend. He's acting like someone who avoids confrontation and doesn't know how to tell you to leave him alone. You need better friends than that."
d6goau,"NAH, however to make sure you won't take away the attention from the bday girl, arrive a day early"
d6gue6,[deleted]
d6guo7,NTA- but make an effort to comfort your half sister as much as possible! Families are complicated and I totally get why you would not have wanted to see him
d6gv9i,"Eh.  NAH...you definitely did right by stopping the car...driving while upset and fighting isn't safe.  You also did right by driving as quickly as you were comfortable while still being safe.

The only reason I'm not calling her an asshole is because she was probably panicked and terrified for her mom, and that sort of stress makes people nuts sometimes.   She wasn't justified by any means, but its understandable and it seems like she's trying to reach out to apologize and make up.  In the cold light of day, knowing her mom is okay she probably realizes how out of line she was.

You're under no obligation to forgive her, but you might want to consider it anyway...or at least talking to her to get a read on whether she's remorseful."
d6gvgp,"NTA. He is not communicating with you and that is number one in a marriage. I'm glad you are seeking therapy because his behavior is awful. He should also seek help. 

Also, did you know anything about his need for porn? Did he hide an addiction from you?"
d6gxow,"NTA. She should've Ubered home especially acknowledging they had money to buy more beers. It's your couch and your house and you were doing them a favor. They had the privilege to stay at your place, not the right, and certainly not the right to mess it up when you specifically told them not to."
d6gzix,"Yes, YTA. Your gf is right that it's her roommate's home too and she can dress however she feels comfortable. Maybe take a look at why it matters to you instead of trying to police someone else's body in their home.

Edited to add I'm not replying to any more comments on this thread. Poll has closed. Even OP has edited to add that he understands he needs to work on his mindset. Maybe the rest of you who want to argue can follow his example."
d6gzks,"NTA. Y’all are married/inextricably financially linked and she isn’t paying her credit card bills while you are actively trying to improve your credit scores. That’s a pretty solid AH move on her part, even if it’s unintentional as she claims."
d6h1u0,"NTA - he was being annoying about your viewing party.  His style of watching TV is shared by many others, and he should feel free to make more friends and find a group who would love to do it that way."
d6h4gi,"YTA: if you’ve got multiple alarms going off that you can’t immediately shut off, without walking across the room.  First year flat mates have drama because you’ve typically lived a coddled life in your parents’ home.  Go to bed earlier so you can wake up early or on time. Oh, you’re a software engineer at uni?  Congratulations, but if you plan on having a job someday, you’ll have to be responsible."
d6h543,"I don't need to tell him what a shithead he is. I know it, and he knows it.   
Also, his drinking didn't really ruin my life. The whole 'being in jail up until 5th grade and being a lying deadbeat afterward' thing was what made my childhood generally shitty."
d6hayq,NAH. Why can't you go separately? You already had plans set with your family.
d6hc60,"YTA, it's been a week in a new country and she's making new friends. It's important that she spends time with these new friends so she actually has bonds with people besides you. Let her have fun in a new place and just ask that she call you at the end of the day/in the morning so she can tell you about it. If you're this insecure , consider breaking up because LDRs really only work when both people are very secure in the relationship."
d6he2u,"NTA, racists don't get the benefit of the doubt, and they don't get to judge anyone. You are doing the right thing."
d6hhb2,"Parents need to realize how the way they criticize their children's bodies can haunt them for years.  This kind of stuff can really mess you up and is very serious.

That being said, when the dramatic climax of the fight was:

  I LEGIT HAVEN’T TAKEN A SELFIE IN THREE WEEKS BECAUSE I HATE HOW IT LOOKS. 

There are just not enough words for how hard I rolled my eyes."
d6hiri,"NAH your grandmother is mentally ill, she can’t help her actions. However; you’re entitled to some resentment because of how she affects your living situation everyday."
d6hj8w,"NTA, but it seems like you could avoid a whole lot of office drama and bullshit, by just explained to her that she's the only hardcore country fan in the office. You don't need to be mean about it or make her feel stupid, just let her know that you try to make sure everyone has a say and you'll make sure some country is included in the rotation.

Honestly this whole thing sounds like it's passive aggressive and could be solved easily with a little bit of communication."
d6hk2i,"NTA - while trivial, you are TECHNICALLY correct.  The best kind of correct.

Editing to add: After thinking about it, it's not that trivial.  You have to take an extra step to access the restroom that women do not have to take.  And if there is no one at the desk to give you the key right that minute, you have to wait, and your job could run late as a result.  That's putting a unique burden on men working for this company, but not women.  And if the building contracted you to work there, they are obligated to provide a restroom."
d6hoem,NTA. Don’t tell SD shit anymore.
d6hopn,"YTA

> everyone seems to hate it, including my teachers. 

There's a time and place for PDA. A classroom is not it."
d6hpso,"Ahhh.  The land of impressions. I think unless one is practicing for standup it’s mostly assholish to make fun of another’s speech patterns. 

Would the friend have felt remorse and regret if it turned out the professor overheard the statement?

On the other hand, imitation is the highest form of flattery. I had a professor who looked like he was talking and holding a cigar in one hand and a bourbon in the other, minus those actual objects.  Did we make impressions of him. Yes!

So, yes it’s assholish, but it’s an assholish behavior that is socially accepted. Even so, it does not make you TA for bringing up that trying to imitate the accent poorly is in poor humor. 

NTA"
d6hqtn,"NTA, but maybe do a little less pearl clutching about her living with other men before their relationship started. Big yikes on your part."
d6htv2,"NTA- she should have let him out before bed. You guys need to agree that last one asleep takes him out as well as first one up. In the mornings, the rule in my house is that you let dogs out first before anything else."
d6hvsm,"NTA. 

Not like you were given any service. You’re not eating in. You’re not obligated to tip. 

The person ringing up your order was most likely being extra friendly in hopes that you might tip. The fact that her mood immediately dropped after not receiving one seems sucky. You’re supposed to be polite and friendly regardless of whether you’re being tipped or not—especially if you work in a customer service type role."
d6hxno,"NTA. You pay rent, you're a tenant. Legally he should give you 24 hr notice before he enters the premise. Coming from a relationship stand point though, parents usually have trouble with kids who establish boundaries. Give him some time. He'll get used to it eventually."
d6i1z4,So you’re leaving your wife with a 5 month old baby just as she’s starting a new job? Without warning? YTA imo
d6i6s9,"NTA. This is Classic Teen Behaviour, and both your request and your response to her refusal are reasonable and proportionate."
d6iegt,"NTA, who shows up to a kid's birthday party uninvited?"
d6ik4t,"NAH: You do whatever you need to do for the sake of you and your fiance.

That said, this proves that their fears are valid. You will not go this year, and then you'll remember next year that it was so much better without them and you'll skip again, etc... Eventually, you'll stop going altogether, and this may bleed into other events/holidays.

With time, your father's mood should improve. Perhaps you could be direct with him and let him know that you would like him to enjoy the holiday, and what can you do to help make that happen?"
d6ivt1,"YTA. While running mundane errands like getting gas, she might want to be treated like everyone else. It's extremely rude for you to comment on it as the gas station attendant.  It's no different from commenting on another woman's breasts, or someone's artificial leg.

> Just wanted to let her know that I didn't mind at all.

It's not for you to ""mind"" anything. Your approval is not needed. Your opinion is irrelevant.  Just work the gas pump and keep your comments to yourself."
d6ixm7,"NAH.

You gave her permission to do what she's doing so she's not an asshole.

You're also not an asshole for rescinding that permission"
d6izds,"NTA. Imagine it this way: your roommates know you don't like fish. They eat fish occasionally, and the microwave starts to stink of it. You find out you're allergic to fish and the smell of it could cause you to be physically miserable for hours. Your roommates still make fish.

Would you still think you're a bad person for moving?"
d6ize2,NTA. You guys had an arrangement and she broke it. Plain and simple you had every right to take the phone back and now you dont have to worry about negative repercussions from missing payments.
d6j0rd,"NTA. Your child, your choice. Your mom hasn’t made much of an effort to be in your life, so why should you make the effort now? You have every right to be hesitant about having a relationship with her."
d6j2z3,NTA your wife sitting there insinuating that your SIL is bulimic is fucked up and completely inappropriate.
d6j63z,NTA - Driving safe is important. That other mom would have saved more time if she just got a different spot in the first place.
d6jc2k,NTA - Your dad has some serious boundary issues. Set some new boundaries and make sure you stick to them. Do not give an inch.
d6jc88,"NTA

Morgan sounds like she is terrible for Jack. She is not just anybody that Jack is datiing, she is a known asshole."
d6jdlo,NTA. Perhaps another retail type job would be better that saying you work at a diner.
d6jdxi,"I mean, you’re a millennial?"
d6jeaw,NTA you live 2 hours away. I mean you will spend more on travel than they would on a babysitter.
d6jhyu,"NTA: here’s why:

You have full custody

Court agreement every other weekend, 2 weeks summer


That’s it. Anything extra is pure kindness. You don’t owe them anything besides that."
d6ji8u,"YTA. This isn't your company, this isn't you doing your job, this is just you wanting to put your nose in where it doesn't belong because you think he's getting special treatment."
d6jiuy,NTA. Get over there ASAP because she sounds shady as hell
d6jnhl,"NAH

I can see why people would feel awkward removing her, but if it's a parental chat and the phone now belongs to a 9 year old, then it shouldn't be there."
d6johp,YWBTA but in some cases you have to be the AH and this is one of those cases where I say go ahead and be the AH and come back and update!
d6jq9c,"NTA. If the police have been searching as often as they have, I doubt it's for anything petty."
d6jqvn,YTA.  Just because you are going out with someone doesn't mean you have to join at the hips.  It is healthy for each to have their own friends to hang out with.  Given your gf is a bit depressed about her shrinking circle of friends it's understandable she want to spend some alone time with her remaining friend.
d6jrp4,NTA sounds like you’re trying to be ethical/honest about things whereas your partner is just trying to make an easy buck (not surprising seein as it’s business) I’d say if you’re the one that has a good relation with the vendor and are more trusted by the investors it might be time to make it on your own
d6jt66,NTA - but fences make good neighbors
d6juca,"NTA at all, I'd even say you have to do this. But they probably will take it very badly."
d6jvy9,"NTA.  This policy is bonkers.  They are effectively stealing from employees to fund their own charity, knowing that most people won't want to be seen as the opt-out-er.  I'm also curious how they can do this legally since you have a negotiated salary and they are now taking money from it without your explicit consent."
d6jyfi,"YTA

The issue is not the game they are playing. It is that they are using slurs against your (and your son's) people.

So, instead of asking them to stop playing war, ask the principle to talk to them about bias and how in play, they could choose different parties in their wars. (e.g. they can just choose two colors for each side)"
d6k00n,"NTA, by keeping this secret he’s allowing his parents to treat you in such a shitty way and talk badly of you? That’s not ok ESPECIALLY since you have a daughter who may hear what your MIL is saying about you. I’d have a conversation with your husband first telling him you’re going to tell MIL for all the reasons you’ve explained and maybe see how he responds. But yeah, nta for sure."
d6k05n,"NTA 

This is what you need to do. DURING THE ACT you need to knock really loud and hard on the door and shout “can you keep the sex noise to a minimum please?”

OR

Have a family meeting with mom, dad, you, brother, and girlfriend. If they don’t like that their privacy isn’t being respected, point out to them that you would LOVE for them to be more private and to not involve the family against their will into the sex act by forcing them to be an auditory audience. Tell them that you being involved in their sex lives is exactly the problem and could they please take more care to keep to themselves so the rest of you dont have to experience their intercourse."
d6k13j,YTA.   Bold move to fuck up by leaving the oven on and then to double down and argue with your dates roommate about it.   Would it have killed you to just own up to your mistake and apologize?

d6keka,"NTA

Misophonia is a real thing. I feel your pain."
d6kmvw,"NAH.  

How about rather than saying that you aren't going to dinner, ask your dad if you can all meet up in a private location first so you can meet your brother's girlfriend and your father's girlfriend's daughter in private rather than in public.  You are going to have to meet these people eventually, and even though your anxiety is a real thing, don't let it stop you from doing something that you want like seeing your family."
d6kmwo,"YWBTA. When you are that sick/in pain, you are 100% survival mode. That is not the time to be concerned about the comfort of your healthy friend.

d6ksp5,"YTA if you ask that of her. It's her friend's wedding and that in and of itself is a big deal. Not to diminish your anniversary, but the wedding takes precedence, it would be rude of her to not attend the reception and it would likely hurt her friend's feelings. You can celebrate your anniversary another day close to the actual date, lots of people have to do that because of work schedules, etc."
d6kzdw,"NAH - she’s approaching your ED in a way that isn’t constructive, but is trying. There definitely needs to be more active listening on her part.

I hope you have support to overcome your ED and can find foods that you can/want to eat."
d6l4f1,"NTA, but you're a fecking eejit to stay with her, she sounds like an absolute melt."
d6l5pf,"NAH

Problem is you didnt talk to them first. Now you are one the hook and you didnt clear it with the friends.

If you eat the bill, it's on you"
d6lamo,ESH. You need to leave this job if you're going to be resentful and rude in your approach to issues. Your self respect is suffering here which is totally valid but you gotta change something. Right now you're not a good team player and that's not working out for anyone. Your coworker was inappropriate but that's part of working with people
d6ldv5,"NTA - you were just trying to warn him and he became rude and insulting. Better off that he deleted you, since he seems like a jerk anyway."
d6lf2x,"NTA. If your coworker cared so much, why didn't he invite him?"
d6lhlz,"NTA, I would say no assholes at all if she seemed kinder and more appreciative but, you got your own life and she should have other friends or family members who are able to help her so she doesn’t rely on just one, or she could pay you for your help running around as her minion."
d6lhr0,"NTA - Just because they know you doesn’t mean they’re *entitled* to your performance. I can’t stand the whole “what the bride wants, the bride gets” bullshit. That doesn’t negate the fact she’s being a total asshole about this. There are other bands that I’m sure play similar music and you want to enjoy your *best friend’s* wedding. And some might say “well it’s their wedding and you’re making it about you,” and sure, that can be argued. But that’s still *your* time that you are using and they are, again, not entitled to your time if you do not want to play. Your best friend needs to grow some balls, this won’t be a good marriage if he follows the “happy wife, happy life” mantra.

(I guess your other post got removed? Here’s my comment from there)"
d6llpt,"Okay. First, putting the dogs nose in pee is not a standard and effective strategy for dog training. 

Also, yelling at the dog when they bark is not effective either.

Your grandmother probably sees that your methods don’t work. And she probably doesn’t like you shoving urine in her dogs faces."
d6lmo1,"NAH - people grow apart, no one is being cruel here."
d6ls6y,"NTA. That’s disgusting and just plain rude. He should hold it. The excuse “you take too long” is a load of rubbish because baths can take an hour plus and I’d still argue he should wait. You’re already being generous enough to let him pee, most wouldn’t even do that."
d6lwpv,"NTA they don't have to tell you, and you asking is showing that you care. Friendship does not mean you're entitled to all the details of each other's lives, it means that you support each other and enjoy each other's company."
d6lx2f,"NAH 

But she's right. Any bystander could call the cops, and you end up on the news."
d6m2ep,"NTA, but should only be informing the parent. Obviously this woman isn't an attentive mother, but it still goes a long way to say, ""Did you know your son was playing on the roof?"" Rather than, ""Your son shouldn't be playing on the roof."""
d6m2tj,"NTA - I cut myself for years throughout middle and high school. Classmates saw and never said/did anything. I wish they had. Self harm is always a cry for help, even if it's one we don't realize we're saying. Please talk to a counselor or teacher you trust about this. Though self harm is not the same as being suicidal, it's incredibly dangerous and is associated with higher rates of infection and unintentional suicides from accidents. Yes, she may be mad at you in the short term (though, honestly, if she's rolling up her sleeves in classes, the report could come from anyone and she may not know), but in the long run she will thank you if she gets the help she needs."
d6m9b1,NTA. Your SO is seriously lacking in empathy. What she did was nearly vindictive. It's like she wanted all the good feelings of having done something nice for someone at the expense of hurting someone else. Pretty callous.

I would definitely not have my family nor my in-laws at my place for longer than 3 days in a row. Parents and in-laws tend to have some sense of entitlement and not respecting boundaries. 

Whether they can afford an Airbnb or not, it can still be solved by offering to pay half of the costs. If they chose to spend that money on presents, they are basically choosing what's best for you and just ignoring what you are telling them. 

I would strongly recommend for you to read more about settling boundaries and how to communicate them effectively, because it's a whole art. Not only it's about when it's OK to have boundaries or not, but also how it invades your own thoughts. 

This has nothing to do with their disability. This is extremely common between family members. If you wish to keep a healthy relationship with them, you need to reset your own understanding of the dynamics. 

Therapy or just some time to read about the matter should be enough, and they might be offended at the beginning (most parents are), but its for the common good."

I never like telling people that they are assholes just for having feelings. One shouldn’t get called an asshole for what one feels; asshole status is earned for what one does.  As long as you don’t **do** anything about your feelings of jealousy — such as letting them be known so that somebody else feels responsible for them — you are in the clear.

Now as for whether your grandparent screwed you over ... what you need to remember here is that your sister’s car and your car have nothing to do with each other. Her car doesn’t lessen the value of yours. 

Your grandparent had their reasons for the amount of money they were spending, and it likely had something to do with your sister’s illness, yes. However, it is the grandparent’s money to do with as they like. And again, they **did** buy you a car and the fact that your sister also got one changes nothing.

She can't force you to go on a vacation that you're going to have to pay for if she's not willing to compromise with you on the terms and conditions.

But don't let her force you into it and refuse to pay later. That would cause some unnecessary drama. Give her the choices: A) they cover your expenses and you get to go, B) they cover your expenses and agree to receive payments for it later as you can afford, or C) you don't go."

Tradesmen work a lot of hours to make a living. You say that the current arrangement worked well when you were in grad school (i.e. when you likely had a lot more study commitments and less regular hours). The only thing that's changed - apart from the dog - is *your* circumstances. You are now working regular hours at a regular job, so want him around when you get home. 

So, when it suited you, you were OK with the side-hussles, but now it doesn't suit you, so you're not OK?

I agree that he should be consistent on this - especially when he promised to cut down when you got a dog.

On the other hand, carpenters and people doing physical work have quite a short window to make decent money - especially in construction/renovations. He may be physically incapable of doing heavy work or long hours when he gets older. As a young man, this is his window of opportunity to make decent money - in the same way that you went to grad school to get a rung-up on your career.

Yes, by all means, he should be doing his fair share as far as the dog is concerned, and he shouldn't commit to things when he promised he wouldn't, but you also sound controlling and a tad selfish, IMO.

It's not fair to say that you would ""rather have him home than the extra money"". OK, but what does HE want? What if you break up? This is his time to make money. Do you have any idea how many tradesmen aged 40+ simply can't work any more because of physical injuries, health etc.??

Yeah, sorry, but you sound demanding and short-sighted."

B) You use studying for the exam as a reason, but throw out that there's a party you want to go to as well. 

C) You want to lie about the reasons? Come on. It's like you know it's an asshole move to cancel when the team is depending on you, so you want to lie to lessen the blow(another asshole move)."
d6v03e,"NTA

He's trying to take advantage of his sister. Please do whatever you can to talk her out of agreeing to these terms."
d6v3pe,"NTA. Your purpose for going to the gym is some alone time and maintaining your fitness. If that can’t happen with you going to the gym with your friend, it’s completely valid for you to express this concern to your friend. Instead of saying that he’s weak, mention that you need to try a more rigorous routine to maintain your fitness and that you feel like you have been falling behind on it. Maybe when you guys go to the gym, tell him that he can do his stuff and you can do your own (preferably on the opposite ends of the gym or plug in some headphones so you can get some alone time)."
d6v4p6,"YTA. You had your son circumcised as a religious tradition, but you're upset that your fiance wants someone to splash some water on your babies head?"
d6v6mz,"NTA. For someone to watch you struggle, ‘feel bad’ but continue with the lie, says a lot about your husband. He is deceitful. He is going to do this again. Probably with money, and who knows what else. I hope you have a strong support system!"
d6v82w,NTA- it becomes a problem when everyone can smell the problem
d6v96p,"NTA. Nothing pisses me off more than men who refer to looking after their own children as “babysitting”. It’s parenting, not babysitting, and there’s no opt-out clause. It’s tough shit. Put your foot down."
d6vjwi,"Haha that's NOT antisemitism! She just likes uncut dicks. It's a preference. So yeah, stop sharing details about a near-stranger's sexual preferences! It's weird. YTA."
d6vlbj,"NTA, he was hungry, you gave him food. It shouldn't matter whether it was veg or meat, you still gave a hungry guy some food."
d6vmi9,[deleted]
d6vn1a,"YTA.

I was more sympathetic until you started talking about how you were seen as a “good, clean kid,” as if this girl, your *friend* and on-again-off-again *partner* might dirty you."
d6vnw0,"You aren’t the asshole for having concerns about the age gap, or for sharing those concerns with friends. But YTA for your choice of venue when it came to revealing that info."
d6vpyx,"Info: Did you ask them about your soap? How long were you using his soap for? Did he ever tell you to stop using his soap? 

Him filling it with piss is rather nice extreme imo but we need more details for a real verdict."
d6vsvm,NTA. Talk to her about it and firmly tell her to stop
d6vz6n,">  Then he says it's a pretty asshole move to insist on the health thing instead of just accepting his apologies.

...the man ate 1 and a half pounds of cheese on top of 4 meals. He's your husband FFS, if you're not going to be honest with him about his health who is? Bonus extra weak move whining about fat shaming on his part.

NTA."
d6w112,[deleted]
d6w491,NTA.  If you had skipped out on the day at work when others were at the funeral that would've been one thing.  But you already had the day scheduled off.  No one needs to know why.
d6w86a,NTA you should call them out on it. Coastal culture totally turns its nose on that kind of behavior
d6w9vq,"NAH - I mean I wouldn't say it like that haha but that feels like a very fair compromise. Just tell them we've decided not to hold one but if your family wants to throw a party to celebrate we will of course come, just let us know when and where. Leave it at that - if they want to put money into it let them."
d6w9x1,NTA you have to love your own life. You are not responsible for your mum.
d6wal7,[removed]
d6wayt,"NTA. All she has to do is call the court in the jurisdiction where she was pulled over. It's that simple.

If she doesn't show, this could get a lot more complicated for her and a warrant could be issued. 

She also brought all this on herself for driving with a suspended license, so she's additionally TAH there"
d6wb4z,NTA... what a douche canoe... However I think it is great your family had your back.
d6wey2,Ew no NTA sounds like she’s more comfortable trying to placate him instead of make him responsible. If he made the mess he has to clean it
d6whup,What she did is sexual assault. I would never speak to her again and she is lucky you disnt press charges. NTA ever.
d6wmql,YTA. Sounds like you have a lot of resentment towards your ex that you're taking out on your daughter.
d6wq76,Are you in the USA??? So weird. I'm American and never heard of it. NTA. There is no way that guy needs to make up wages thru his tips.
d6wqu1,NTA. No reason to stick your neck out at work when you know it won't work out; it'll just reflect badly on you. Tell him you aren't in charge of that and to apply directly.
d6wsek,YTA but not for anything to do with the hygiene. It sounds like you're taking care of yourself as expected so no problem there. The issue is you're about to accuse your co-worker when you don't have any real evidence just because you don't have a good relationship with them. You need something more to go on before you start accusing people.
d6wuac,"NTA. Big family all together is a very, very different dynamic to nuclear-family-plus-one-mother-in-law. One of them could be fun, and the other is a recipe for disaster. Also, I am allergic to anyone who calls their forty-year-old son their baby."
d6wucp,NTA I can understand why you would want to limit your contact with them as much as possible. Unfortunately it sounds like you’re whole family is toxic and I would distance myself as soon as possible if that’s an option.
d6wvni,C'mon OP. You know you're NTA.
d6ww2c,NTA. Pantry is a better place for them than your bedroom.
d6x0m3,Why don’t you use it yourself? The barrier would have the same effect.
d6x3dt,YTA. Get out of the left lane. I'm a pretty calm driver but someone coasting  below the speed limit not even attempting to make a good distance would irk me. Ride in the right lane if that's your style.
d6x5jo,"NTA

\*locks housemate out of house for 1 hour and 20 minutes\*

\*calls housemate selfish for not enjoying being locked out of the house\*

What the actual fuck? Just out of curiosity, don't you have keys to your own house?"
d6xcut,"NAH. You paid for all the stuff for the cat?   Maybe you should have let her keep it since you have other pets, but I would have asked for reimbursement."
d6xeq5,[deleted]
d6xfix,"Nta, in fact you should call her out on her AH behavior. Ask how she'd feel if she were in the BF's shoes. Or how it felt when it happened to her, and why is she causing that harm to someone else. Even if the cheater claims to be poly, cheating is still cheating."
d6xft0,Gonna go against the grain. YTA lol so what if shes open and honest with you. Like. This just doesn't look good on you dude. However leave now if you're gonna leave or you're going to hurt her far worse the longer you string her along

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
d6xrde,NTA Your mom doesn’t respect your relationship at all. You’re almost 30 get outta here with this “my house my rules” bs. You are LIVING TOGETHER it’s so stupid to even request you don’t share a room.
d6xuv0,"haha, wow, uh, this is a *lot* more than playing fucking video games with someone who bought you a gift. this person is off the wall obsessed with you and you are absolutely complicit in encouraging this behavior simply by continuing to be his friend. this person needs to be cut off yesterday, dude. he isn't your friend. he's a dog that's humping your leg. stand up for yourself. NTA"
d6xvq1,"YTA. 

Imagine you're sat in a cafe or whatever and you see some person keep staring at you, then furiously scribbling on a bit of paper, then stare some more, then furiously scribble....

Mega uncomfortable. People don't go to public places so you can sit and paint then, ask permission or don't do it."
d6xw2t,"NAH - I get the disrespect element but I think saying ""I made too much pizza / sandwiches / whatever if you're hungry"" is perfectly acceptable."
d6xw9f,"YTA for how you're going about it. You're not teaching him to save, you're forcibly taking half of his check! If you want to teach him to budget, sit down with him and go through budgeting with him! Also, half is a LOT - most financial planners suggest around 10-15% into savings. It's his money, he should decide what he wants to do with it. Him blowing all his money is also a great way for him to learn how to save - because he'll spend all his money, find something else he wants, then he'll have to wait or save to get it. Tithing him won't really help (although I suppose that'll prepare him for eventually paying rent, but at 16 that's mean)."
d6y0on,"NTA but I can see where a female employee could get annoyed that a male customer would wander into her interaction with a customer and ""flaunt"" his expertise. Not saying you did anything wrong, but there's a pretty good chance that's why she got annoyed.

Edit: this of course assumes OP is male. Which they may not be, in which case this point is moot."
d6y23s,"NTA.

&#x200B;

God being a teenager sucks."
d6y7vf,"YWBTA. These are kids, you cannot just uninvite them. Just send out a follow up note / email / text and let the parents know ""hey guys the venue needs to know how many kids will be there to plan accordingly. The RSVP deadline is next week. please RSVP if you can make it"" I bet most people just forgot or put it as low priority since you sent the invites roughly a month before the party."
d6y8p7,"YTA - build a ""catio"" if your cat needs to be outside. Outdoor cats are a nuisance. If it was a dog pooping in your neighbors yards you'd obviously be in the wrong so the same applies here."
d6y9u6,"NTA- Of course you should tell them. Telling them may hurt them now, but it'll help later."
d6ydwy,YTA. A group chat is not the place for that. It negatively impacts everyone else needlessly. That would be true even if you had reminded the roommate several times in person already. Presumably the next step would have been to get the RA involved.
d6ydxp,"NAH 

>one of my step dad’s kids moved in with us due to some personal issues. 

>She is in her mid-20’s and completely able-bodied but does not have a job and does not even get asked to do things around the house. My parents don’t push her to get a job

This makes me think something really serious happened to her, or is still happening to her."
d6ykgk,"NTA - She asked if you would be ok with it, and then went ahead and did the thing you're not ok with. Obviously she's not respecting your opinion in the matter when you made it clear before you even moved in together. 

Sorry dude, if you can maybe find somewhere else to crash for the weekend."
d6ylal,"NTA but lol I would just ask sis why she needs the attention.  If something does come back as wrong, say sorry but don’t feel bad about being skeptical given what you’ve shared."
d6ylx2,"NTA

If they bought a ticket without consulting you to find out if you wanted to go and were able to go, then you are absolutely not at fault."
d6ynfu,"NTA. You guys got into an argument and we’re both shitty to each other. That being said, your question is about not letting your mom use your car if I’m understanding right, or taking her somewhere in it. If she doesn’t respect your car, she absolutely doesn’t get to use it. She didn’t make any payments, she drove it all over, she left it messy and dirty. She needs to get her own car fixed instead of relying on you to be her personal free uber or rental car company."
d6yo3y,"You don't need to confront her.  I would start my own list, if she ever brings up hers - bang - money shot."
d6yorm,"NTA since you use both bottles. Why don’t her parents just buy her a bottle? Since she likes water cold, she’ll probably continue to use it after her trip so it’s not like it’s a waste of money."
d6yqpv,"NTA

Dude sounds like a mess of a person. He was 27 and dating an 18 year old? Yikes.

Stop giving this person money. You're going to paying those student loans for YEARS to come, probably for at least a decade or so. You have no financial obligation to help this person whatsoever. If he can't get his finances together that's not your problem. To me it sounds like he's absolutely using you."
d6ytab,"NTA - If she can pay back the $40 every month, I don't see why she keeps having to ask for it."
d6yy7t,"NTA.  There is no reason at all for him to ask you personal questions.  If he was ""just being friendly"" he could have asked you if would like to try some sample or make some small talk like ""How is your day going?""  Asking for your name and life history is inappropriate at best and because you felt him look you up and down I think it's pretty fair to say he was not only being an asshole but also a total creep."
d6z0wt,"Yes, YTA. Your insecurities are turning into controlling behavior. Trust your girlfriend or break up with her, she deserves better than to have someone checking in on her.

Texting the landlady instead of just letting your GF do it........ Who does shit like that? Let her take care of her own issues, this is the relationship equivalent of a helicopter parent."
d6z1ms,"I was ready to be all ""he can tattoo whatever he wants on his body"" but holy shit these tattoos are stupid... I'm so sorry. NTA."
d6z5l2,"NTA this was planned and someone leaving the company does not constitute an emergency, boss or not."
d6zaou,YTA. He may be a dumbass but you're an arrogant twat with a superiority complex.
d6zb27,You sound sad and may have survivors guilt. Have you considered talking with a therapist before just giving up on everything? You could use some support and this isn't the right sub for that.
d6zc9f,"**NTA** obviously.  

A dog whether a puppy or not is a big responsibility and going out after work without coming home to feed, walk and/or interact with the pet is 100% unacceptable.

She's only had the puppy for 24 hours and is already being a shitty pet owner.  Imagine how neglectful she'll be once the infatuated newness wears off.   Tell her to return the puppy before the end of the weekend.  And BTW.... are you guys in a rental property?  Because if so, pets (puppies especially) are generally a complete no no unless prior approval was received by the landlord and the appropriate pet deposits have been hammered out & paid."
d6zhpw,"Depends. For some women, cramps are bad enough to make walking around painful. For others, walking around while wearing pads can also be a less than stellar experience. There's plenty of reasons she might have wanted to stay in because of her period.

Plus she said her feet were hurting her, which was likely the main reason she didn't want to go traipsing around town."
d6zhzz,"You dont need permission to report to CPS. You can do so anonymously or call in a welfare check. No one has to know you called.

NTA. Just fucking call, man."
d6zlcn,"NTA. It's not your job to bail someone with no motivation out just because he's related. If your mom gives a shit, he can move in with her."
d6zs4i,NTA I hate people that makes jokes at the expense of other people. Probably my number one pet peeve
d6zu1f,"NTA

But take that with a grain of salt because I LOATHE backseat drivers. Unless someone is doing something dangerous while I'm in the car I'm not about to correct things like speed up, slow down, switch gears blah blah blah."
d6zwi2,"YTA

You're judging things you have no clue about.  Maybe he has some issues as well that she's helping him with.  Maybe your perception of the situation is wrong.  In general, unless things become abusive, stay out of people's relationships."
d6zzov,"NTA you have no obligation to do things for your sister's kids. If your parents are so worried about them missing the magic, they should buy them tickets."
d700x0,NTA. You gave her a $150 Gift Card and she's still mad? I mean it definitely sucks... but you feel horrible. You probably feel worse than she does. I'm not sure what more she expects from you at this point.
d702l3,"NTA. If the guy really wanted to sit with his wife, he could have switched seats with somebody in his wife’s row and given somebody else a front-row seat. It’s not fair to ask somebody to switch seats with you when their seat is objectively better than yours."
d702rf,"YTA. I want to say NTA because you are being the most pragmatic and you are correct that legally you are guaranteed nothing. Unfortunately though, it’s your dad’s money and his call to make."
d704og,"NTA. Sometimes, one is smuggling peanuts, and there's very little that can be done about it. And going after mental health stuff as an insult is a very low blow."
d70518,"Absolutely NTA.  Hes treating you like a renter or a roommates hes never met, rather than a girlfriend he loves.  HE asked you to move in. Having an agreement is fine, but he should have involved you in every step.  You should have a say about what goes into it.  Give it some serious thought before you move in.  Is he going to treat it as HIS house and you are a guest, or will it be your home as well?"
d705st,NTA Of course you don’t have to continue paying his phone bill.
d707rv,"I’m a nursing student as we speak. 

NTA. Report the shit out of her. Get her fired, if you can, and don’t stop until she’s the one complaining about not having a job. 

That’s so unprofessional and out of line it’s not even funny. I wouldn’t dream of saying something like that to a patient."
d70al0,"NAH

10 minutes is more than enough. You cannot be expected to spend an unscheduled half an hour listening to random strangers."
d70b2w,NTA. Plans change.
d70b8z,"NTA. 

She agreed to walk. She chose to drink and eat knowing she would have to walk afterward. She complained the whole time while walking. You offered to get a taxi. She refused. She continued to complain the entire time. You can’t win in this situation. 

You’re a saint for being so patient with her. I would’ve gotten her a taxi anyway and just went on a walk by myself. The fact that there are able-bodied people who can’t walk one mile without bitching about it is absolutely mind-boggling to me."
d70dog,"NTA. The bartender was an asshole to complain.

The concept that tipping should be a specific percentage of the bill is nonsense. It should be based on the time and effort a waiter/bartender (or whoever) spent on that service. Opening a couple bottles and pouring a couple simple drinks does not warrant a big gratuity."
d70fro,NTA but this is just a validation post lol
d70g65,"NTA 

The restaurant manager is... It sucks for your boyfriend to be in a dead-end job where he is not valued. There is also nothing wrong with how you are celebrating your new job. You aren't rubbing it in his face, or throwing a big party."
d70i2a,"NTA. Doesn't sound like a friend to me.

You control your own life, you don't have to be friends with an asshole"
d70igi,"NTA
Calling you out in class is one of the most embarrassing things a teacher can do, and I totally empathize. Asking you questions like that because you look tired? That seems strange. Maybe there’s more context behind her actions, but she should have talked to you in private and not cornered you. What can she do? You switched classes, so you’re not under her jurisdiction. Don’t feel bad for standing up for yourself."
d70jil,"Did I miss where you said they were openly admitting to just playing with your emotions by saying they would go when they had no intentions of doing so? That wasn't what I read at all.

They gave you excuses why they couldn't go. You don't believe them, but that doesn't mean it was ill intention. Money is a real, valid excuse for them not to want to go. You said you were going to pay but didn't tell them... But it isn't the only reason. The reasons don't have to be 'good enough' for you... it has to be good enough for them. 

Their not going wasn't about you. So yes, I would see it as an asshole move to call them out because they didn't do what you wanted or you don't feel their excuses are good enough for you."
d70jjy,YTA for implying he has malicious intents when there isn’t really anything he is doing wrong. It was a rude comment IMO
d70kyn,"NAH - disagreeing on something small, not making a big deal of it and moving on with compromise. Why would anyone be an asshole here?"
d70rdl,"YTA - While I agree that people should be sharing tables in a situation like that, it's common courtesy to ask the person already sitting down if you and your friends can join him. Not doing so is rude."
d70s2g,"From a former band geek (highschool marching band and a little drum corps)- Id like to issue a huge **YTA.** (to anyone not in band, or never was in band, the below might sound harsh)

This is something you had no right doing- leave it to section leaders or your band director. It comes down to hierarchy and dots- worry about yourself for your first 3 years.

 Youre a sophomore, in most marching bands thats a second year freshman. Your sophomore friends dont know wtf theyre talking about, the seniors were right. If I had done something like this in my band, Id have gotten removed from the next show and told to run laps. What if you were actually in the wrong spot, thus throwing everything else off? Would you be able to tell from your perspective on the field? 

I graduated 6 years ago and still understand the pecking order. It goes, Band Director- Assistant- Drum Major- Section Leaders- Misc. Upperclassmen- then freshman 1 & 2"
d70vmz,"YTA. You can't eat your candy, while telling your friend he can't eat his."
d70w9b,"NTA.

What on earth would be the point in stores if we all just paid for a random person's purchases instead of our own?

You could do something nice for someone else in order to pay it forward - but there's absolutely no expectation to do so.

Anyone who tries to start a chain of everyone behind them being obligated to pay for the purchases of someone else instead of themselves, that's an asshole."
d70weq,"YTA, your wife didn't eat because she was busy taking care of your shared children,  and you did get to eat because she did that. You don't get to talk down to her when she is making sacrifices for you."
d70woc,"Nta, tell her to not be so ungrateful."
d70xhp,"NTA. You're not obligated to work when you're not being paid. Your company isn't entitled to free labor.

Also, tip: If you're West Coast, call the IRS after 5pm. If you're East Coast, call first thing in the morning. You're more likely to get through when the line is only open in your time zone."
d70xw3,"NTA - you tried to help, went over and above even. Dude needs anger management and realistic expectations. Neither of which is your fault."
d711zf,"SURELY this is a shitpost. YTA. If your girlfriend needed a doctor because she was so sick and your priority was your game, I'm shook that she didn't just dump you on the spot. But for you to then play for hours and not hear from her, and then seemingly not care she was admitted to hospital? Wow, dude. You don't deserve her."
d7138l,NTA- tell him! I'd want to know!
d7147m,"NTA: however I agree with other posters, if you aren’t ready to talk about rings you aren’t ready for marriage. Marriage involves tons of expenses. You need to be able to discuss these together without a fight every time."
d7173l,"NAH - That's just how depression works I'm afraid. Yeah it's annoying but the fact that you're still there is great. 

I don't know if you've ever suffered with it, but depression is fucking awful. You do start to isolate yourself socially - whether it be a ""everyone is better off without me"" thing or a ""I genuinely don't have the energy to be social"" thing. 

But dealing with people going through the tough times is also exhausting. It's fine to have frustrations especially when you're rearranging your schedule for things, but keep inviting your friend out - it's nice just to know that someone does still care and does want to see you despite how much you push them away (trust me, I've been there and the ones I push away but who push back are the ones who are the ones who care)

Just a suggestion, but see if she wants to do something after her first appointment? There's often a lot to unpack and it's nice to have someone you trust to give you some reassurance"
d719z0,"NAH.  At least between you and your ex.  Your ex has moved on, and that's ok.  You haven't yet, and that's ok too.  If anyone is the asshole here it's your ""friends"" who are telling you to move on and insisting that they can't have fun without you."
d71ew6,"Tf? NTA... she can do the inviting

Edit: when you guys go out who pays for food? You take care of it or everyone buys their own?"
d71f46,"NTA ! this is illegal and gross. It's not like they were close in age (16 and 15), he was legally an adult and she legally could not consent. It's not the resulting baby's fault(!) but you definitely don't have to hang with/congratulate/celebrate this father who is also a statutory rapist."
d71i6c,"NAH, but will most of your coworkers be attending? If you're the only one not going then that will look a bit strange."
d71k3v,NTA but it would be the nice thing to do and if you dont you might lose a friend
d71lwe,"**NTA** to bring your concerns to the higher-ups. But I'd warn you that the more you make it sound like ""putting her on blast"" the worse you're going to look. She is misusing the parking space in a way that disrupts your ability to do your job and has refused to fix the issue when asked.  Bring it to HR and have it resolved."
d71nlt,NTA. Cut off her access to your money.
d71q9j,"NTA. Dogs deserve a loving home with someone who cares about their needs.

However it sounds like you just gave the dog away out of the blue, maybe you should have spoken to daughter first, given her one last chance?"
d71sbz,"NTA. A sorry over text is barely an apology. You have the right to be upset at her for this, also with her weak excuse."
d71su6,"NTA, having ADHD doesn't mean we get a pass to be rude.  Guy just needs to learn, if he's bored by a story, that doesn't mean everyone else is and he just needs to get up and wander around.  It's what I do, and while my friends joke that I can't sit still, I don't feel the need to make everyone give me the attention either which I'm sure they appreciate."
d71u0v,"ESH. If you don't trust him, break up with him. It is unfair for him if he isn't even cheating on you. He is TA for cheating previously."
d71u2o,"NTA, skipping the story & special events on a first play thru on a sim/rpg seems like a really odd choice. Making friends with the villagers is so much easier if you do the festivals."
d71ww9,NTA she should have taken it constructively and sort of a light warning to actually clean up after herself. Then turning other co-workers on you as well is just a dick move. She seems clearly used to people cleaning up after her. If she has that bad anxiety she shouldn't be doing a job where you're watched constantly
d71z65,"That backstory is a hell of a ride...

Ignoring the fact that you heavily implied you were violated by B, no you're NTA for not wanting to talk about Lola. She's been an overall drain on your life and it isn't in your best interest to keep her in your life, in discussion or otherwise."
d720tn,"No assholes here. I can understand both sides of the story. Your wife should have understood your need to go, because you explained your intentions multiple times before agreeing to sit down to dinner. However i also understand her feeling like you were ignoring her, you very well may not have heard her but the evidence is against you, however y’all are married and have a kid together, if she seriously doesn’t know you well enough to know you have selective hearing, than oof sounds like she either just wanted to fight, or doesnt pay attention to your feelings very much. Which is kinda shitty 🤷🏻‍♀️"
d722la,YTA. Just because you didn’t see visual damage it doesn’t mean there wasn’t any damage. You could have destroyed a sensor or body clips.

d725up,"YTA 

Not only for lying but for being so short sighted. For a ""smart guy"" it strikes me as really dumb to knowingly burn a bridge with the recruiter. What's the plan? You're going to work on the job for a few weeks until your background check comes back then what?"

First off, you didn't once talk to her about it that you mentioned. Did it ever occur to you that, as their weddings are close together, she might have wanted you but let her sister have you so you didn't go through the expense of being a bridesmaid twice? It's her wedding and her choice. Stop being an asshole and communicate like an adult, but respect it's her right to choose whoever she wants."
d72cso,"honestly, I don't think this needs an asshole judgment. I think you should maybe see a therapist or a counselor if you're not already. it sounds like you need closure or to explore your emotions surrounding these people. you shouldn't have something in your life that makes you feel horrible every day or when you go out in public. 

and as someone who has also been distant with people, I know it's easy to build up in your mind that the people you haven't seen hate you. but think about how you think about them - that's probably how they think about you. I'm sorry you have these loose ends that cause you pain. I hope you can get to a point where you can either rekindle or move on."

Both your mom and your grandma sounds like a delight. I have no idea how being teased for sleeping in can really hurt you, but that's beside the point. Your mom was immature, rude, controlling and just a plain asshole.

Your grandma - well, she just sounds like an overzealous religious person who fed right into all of the bs parts of religion. It's true, that you shouldn't be angry at others, but it has got nothing to do with religion. It's for your own sake: forgive, but don't forget. Spending energy on being hurt and angry is just a waste of said energy.

Also, that you ""*must* forgive when someone apologises"" is such a huge bs, I nearly got a whiplash when I had to do a second take reading it. It's just plain bs made by controlling people who lash out at others, quickly say a halfhearted sorry and expect that with that the matter is closed. They cop out of retaliation, argument and even simple discussion about behaviour that is not okay, this way. It's their free ticket to insult and hurt people without getting anything negative in response. If they act like a dick, this most likely will lead to others telling them off and stopping their bad behaviour. But if they do this apologising-bs and take away the discussion following their assholeness, they are basically free to do whatever.

If I was a petty person, I would turn around this right in their face. Poke some of their sore spots, say sorry and grin in their face while saying how they must forgive you. Only, controlling people like that don't want to let go of their control and would just disregard their own apologise-forgive policy to punish you regardless."

Wealthy men have multiple homes, multiple cars, maybe even a private jet at the local airport. Wealthy men don't just buy their wives a $250 fitbit as an anniversary present.

It absolutely should have been discussed before the contract and that's on everyone involved. Adjusting rent based on the amount of personal space is fairly common (there's even calculators online to help with figuring out how to best divide the rent based on various space factors), but they're assholes for not bringing it up until now.

The fact that you're not willing to discuss it, given that it is common, comes across as being purposefully stingy.

Thankfully, there's an easy and fair fix. Just use one of the online calculators. Chances are, if it's really just that small of a difference, the amount that's fair may be less than they're asking for anyway and this whole thing can just be a learning experience.

d7axos,NAH- i think you just need to clearly communicate to him that it would mean a lot to you if he was able to get some of his work done before or after you guys hung out. Maybe try scheduling a date somewhere where he won’t bring homework? I can’t tell if he knows that you’re upset in the first place
d7b46g,"YTA if you report him without trying to talk to him about it first (if you don't want to speak face to face, slide a note in his mailbox). If you tried it several times and he won't listen, then he's the asshole."
d7b4fw,"This is tricky, but I’m going to ultimately say NAH. She was rude about it, but if you’re a SAHD and she has work the next day, I understand why she would make the request to you. I do think a conversation is in order—just be polite and reasonable, and tell her she isn’t being entirely fair to you."
d7b5ct,"YTA - Sorry, I know that any other time, I'd say Not TA, but the 8th month is dicey. She could go into labor at any time.  

> That pissed me off because I’m not selfish. I’ve done so much for her. 

None of your extra chores trump her growing a human being in her own body."
d7b5e1,"NAH - Prenups aren't romantic but they are practical.  You can write your own stipulations in the document.  These are just off the top of my head and IANAL.  

* For every year you are a stay-at-home mom at his request, you get $X alimony in the event of a divorce. 
* When your children are X age, he will pay your tuition to attend college and earn a degree (if you don't already have one)
* Prior to having children, you will have the career of your choice
* OR, you will NOT be a stay-at-home mother
* You will have X children unless agreed to in writing by both parties
* As a couple you will pay bills based on a percentage of your incomes. So that you aren't always broke. 
* You will alternate holidays with families.
* Your children will be raised X religion or no religion
* You'll be responsible for X chores and he will be responsible for Y chores

These are just examples and by no means am I endorsing one over the other, but just meant to get you thinking about how a prenup isn't just a document that makes sure you're broke if you ever divorce but can help you even if you stay married forever."
d7b7np,YTA- it’s not justifiable that you bailed on your sister last minute. You are an asshole for committing to helping her and she will probably not be able to find someone else so you screwed her out of this opportunity.
d7b7yb,"NTA you're right that was certainly a harsh thing to say. But she kept you hanging on without letting you know what she was doing or where she was, what she did was extremely selfish especially when you had both kids with you. Hopefully this will make her see that you are really upset with her. That said, if she is apologetic, it might be worth apologising to her too if you both love each other and to cut her a bit of slack after just getting out hospital. Hope you guys can move past this."

d7bfzu,day 3 no talk? bruh .. mans is either waiting for you break up with him or already moving on himself
d7borx,"YTA. God, you sound so unbelievably bitter when you talk about this woman. Good on the new girl for calling you out on your bullshit.

Edit: To clarify, you're not obligated to spend time with anyone. But instead of reaching out and even attempting to see what she's like outside of a working environment, you completely exclude her and talk shit about her to the new girl. That's what makes you TA."
d7bqmo,"YTA. A friendship ended over a group project name?

Your former friends will be better off without you."
d7bu41,"Jesus definitely NTA. That's really creepy behaviour, have you told your mother about it? He is definitely in the wrong here. At least ask your mom for a lock on the door to keep his creepy ass out."
d7buuu,"NTA, but why the hell are you letting him move back in? I get that you care about him but you will only ruin your friendship by living with him again. If he is already mad about these conditions, tell him he's not moving in and that he can find someone else to live with. And when he apologises for getting mad and tries to convince you to let him move in anyways, please don't let him. This guy needs to grow up fast."
d7bwco,"NTA. The kindness of a stranger saved me BIG time when I left my lights on in a parking garage. They simply opened my door, shut them off, and left a note. I would have loved to be able to thank them!!"
d7bwmv,NTA. Wearing clothes is the common areas of mixed living situation is a basic part of the social contract.  You are not slut shamming her.  You and other roommate need to have a polite but blunt conversation with her to put on some fucking clothes.
d7c0jy,"NTA. You did not cut contact with your parents, they cut contact with you and your family. It's their loss if they don't want to travel for a few hours to see their grandkids. I get how hard it must be for you to accept this but you are not the one who is in the wrong here. You can always try to have a conversation about it and afterwards decide what to do. If your father gets upset with you about you pointing out his awful behaviour, you know for sure it's best to keep them at a distance."
d7c10p,Yes YTA but a really funny asshole
d7c2ri,"NTA

Your Mom is passive-aggressive and manipulative.  She definitely didn't tell you earlier and she planned to use your place as her personal hotel.  Her emphasis on having a key to your place emphasizes her expectation that YOUR home is at her disposal at any time.

Do you receiveany financial support from your family?  If not, I recommend you have theocks on your place changed.  Don't mention it to anyone else, just have them changed.

And next time Mom tells you that she's visiting at the last minute, tell her, ""Unfortunately, I already have plans.  I really wish you had told me about your trip, earlier, because I would love to see you, but I can't change my plans at this point."""
d7c2s8,NTA. He’s still in high school. You’re still responsible for his education.
d7c4t7,"NTA. 

However, maybe she had good intentions and just wanted you to meet her boyfriend and he is just a socially awkward guy? If she is there for some more time you can maybe ask to meet again, for a ""girls night"" or something?"
d7c5gy,[deleted]
d7c62u,"Sorry, but if they consider him subhuman or treat him as less than because he doesn't share their religious beloefs, they don't deserve his support."
d7cdr4,"NAH. I get your dad is wanting his wife to feel included, but grandma is a special title.  I have step-kids who have kids and they’ve always (my request) called me by my first name. We do fun things together, and when they are at our house I go out of my way to make them feel welcomed & loved - but I’m not their grandma.  I’m not exactly a fan of my husband’s ex, so I didn’t take this approach for her - but for the kids. I hope your dad can learn to respect your wishes."
d7cehc,Info how old are you?  You made sure to say you are an adult but it doesn’t sound like it.
d7ceu7,"NAH, but just be aware that if you're getting to that age, alcohol is just going to be part of the equation going forward. Yes, there are ways to avoid it, but it will be present at most large social gatherings. You know your friends, so if they drink a lot, then yes it could be fairly uncomfortable to be sober there. If not though, it may be good to get used to dealing with situations involving alcohol  in a more controlled space. This is coming from a fellow non-drinker, by the way, one who is going to a wine night with friends this week.

One side note to this is that the equation changes if they don't respect your decision to abstain. Then you definitely don't need to be there."
d7chj6,"NTA. He has the right be crabby, not abusive."
d7cp7q,"YWBTA it's really none of your business. If Jill and Chad are such awful people, just distance yourself from them and move on."
d7csct,"NAH

I get it you’re worried about your friend but you should talk to her, like a lot. Find out from her why she’s doing this. Also people lie about mental and physical health all the time to get into the military. Some recruiters will even tell you to lie."
d7ct5x,"YTA 

Because:

>It's my money,

This is you using money as a position of power in your relationship. 

Not ta for buying it, definitely ta for not having an ""our"" perception of money, especially if she's home with your 2 year old child.

Edited for bot count."
d7cutn,"YTA if you keep pushing it, if your sister moved out at 16 obviously there were some major issues between her and your mom. I'm reading a lot between the lines here that sounds like a golden child trying to defend a parent who ""did absolutely everything right"" and the troublemaker sibling who has it out for them, when in reality the situation is usually far more complicated and I highly doubt your mom is blameless in your sister's refusal to have a relationship with her.

Regardless, your sister has made her position clear so drop it and let her figure out her relationship with your mother in her own time and her own way."
d7cxbk,"ESH. Everyone needs their space, and friends need to respect that. But you didn’t just tell him that you didn’t want to hang out. All of that could’ve been avoided by you just telling him you didn’t want to hang out today. So while yes, the friend sucks, you do carry part of the blame."
d7cz7i,YTA. Stop policing someone else’s body. Think about how she feels. She’s likely doing this because it’s making HER feel better about HERSELF.
d7d2bu,NTA. The only unwritten shade seat rule is if you are taking the hit to sit in the shade seat you get the perk of shade control. I think there’s a Grand Canyon exemption but that’s about it.
d7d2ms,"NTA at all I can't stand people that do that shit, keep your purse pet at home or visit animal friendly places, people who actually NEED service animals have a hard enough time being taken seriously without people like your step mom lying just to bring their pets wherever they want (●__●)"
d7d387,"NTA. She sounds super insecure. You are better off without her in your life.

Also, kind of seems like she agrees with you deep down inside."
d7d3gu,"NAH

You don’t need to attend the birthday of every kid your kid has ever met. I think you should attend their friend’s’ birthdays if scheduling allows. 20 parties a year is excessive. 

They aren’t assholes for including the whole class. Especially since some schools now have rules about including everyone. Stupid, asinine rules."
d7d60a,NTA. That woman stole your bird.
d7dbyh,"NAH, people go to wedding receptions and get wasted all the time right? Yet they don't spend the night at the hall. Responsible guests carpool w friends, make arrangements to have a designated driver, or start drinking water early enough so that they're not a damn mess by the time they need to call an Uber.

Hosting a party doesn't mean you have to host drunk people overnight. Is it expected some people might want that? Yes. But if you set the rules for your house ahead of time, and they come anyway, they should  e prepared to respect your rules."
d7dc2j,"NTA.
You didn’t get her fired. She got herself fired. All you did was tell the place about her actions.

Also, if you switched the scenario- older man hitting on young & older woman, everyone would instantly think it’s gross. Because it’s an older woman, it should be ok? Um, no."
d7dfr9,"Sort of a difficult to understand the setup that you describe him, but lingering just because it's not technically against the rules to be there when you could just get out of the way for somebody is kind of an asshole thing to do.

Also, it sounds like you were extremely over-sensitive."
d7die4,NTA- perhaps it’s time for a place of your own?
d7djmz,My brother farted on my doughnut when I was maybe 8. Back then a doughnut was a once in 3 year treat. I am still upset. I am 60.
d7dsx9,"NTA but dude just block her. You're considering giving her a chance to start over??? Why? She's basically a sentient red flag.

I swear, this is how people get all their stuff lit on fire six months in and go, ""How did this happen?"""
d7dv7q,"NAH you are allowed to make plans without them, they are friends not a spouse or someone who needs to know where you are. If they ask why you didn't tell them just tell them you wanted to navigate the convention on your own this time."
d7dw2x,"YTA because you asked she said, ""it would be a bad idea"".  You don't have to come to visit my family but I would like you to, but I need you to be more available then a 4? hour plane ride away in case of emergency; is a reasonable position for her to take when weighed against your 10?100?500th? day at Disney."
d7dx1z,"YTA.  You weren't trying to do something nice, you were trying to get rid of something nobody likes to carry around.  Trying to disguise it as a ""tip"" made it worse because tipping someone $.60 is really insulting."
d7e33u,"ESH.  You’re an adult and you can decide if you want to share a room with him.  Instead of cancelling, however, you should have just booked your own room.  You can’t insist on staying with him if your family is paying for the room,"
d7e5ea,"NTA, but I'd try going some other routes first, seeing as how the police have already been involved and unhelpful. 

I would try talking to his wife first, and see if he's getting help or not. If not, you could call Adult Protective Services. It's like CPS but for adults, the only issue is that while he's clearly mentally ill, it sounds like there's no abuse or (self) neglect going on. 

If you're in America, maybe contact your local NAMI chapter? They should be able to offer resources and possibly advice. 

https://www.nami.org/find-your-local-nami

edit: Actually, I messed up when posting, I'd advise talking to his wife/family, then NAMI,  and call APS or the police again as a last resort."
d7e5py,"Nta. 

What on earth does he mean he can’t find them! Surely they’re in his house near his tv?! Did he take them on a trip with him? Like wtf?! If you borrow something and lose it/break it you replace it. But seriously how could he have lost DVD’s in a day, whilst watching them?! Is he still stoned?? Has he forgotten how to do looking?"
d7e5r9,ESH .... You don't sound like you even like your girlfriend. You can't *change* her but you're allowed to leave if she's never making time for you and her party habits don't line up with yours
d7e7dr,NTA I did the same thing to a buddy of mine. Seems like you found a compromise.  You'll tell her the real times when she can not make you both late.
d7e88s,"YTA.

Old guy: Young people these days have no respect!

You: I’ll show that old guy! I’m going to do the rude thing.


Like...yeah. He could’ve been nicer about it and not made an assumption, but then you basically proved him right."
d7ea5k,NTA they are being extremely unreasonable and assholes hope you find a great place to live with your puppy
d7edfy,"NTA, you bought them, they're your tickets. It sounds like you were just trying to do something fun with your husband and he's been a dick this entire time."
d7ee4u,"NTA - my family work in catering - some people eat 3 plates of food, some people eat half. They make X amount of food anyway and anything that gets left is wasted. They've already paid for the food so it's not going to cost them more if you eat more. 

There was food left over at the end so - you probably should have had that last plate of food!"
d7eeae,"NTA. Former vet tech here, that matting is so so painful for cats and can cause a lot of skin issues underneath. Unfortunate for the cat. Are you sure it’s actually there’s and not a stray? I’d be doing the same as you and taking it in."
d7egzw,ESH for y'all using a $100 knife for *brownies*.
d7ei9a,"NTA. 
She shouldn’t haven’t messed with your stuff/not rectified the problem. 

Edited as new info."
d7el54,"NTA she is an abuser. She’s gaslighting you now, which is also abuse.  Those things have changed who you are in a negative way and she IS responsible for your panic attacks."
d7enhc,"YTA if you don’t sit down with your wife and plan a budget together. You have children’s futures to think about as well as your own retirement. If you know you can’t afford it and she doesn’t, there is a breakdown in communication somewhere."
d7eovw,[deleted]
d7eqnt,"Yes, YTA. Your GF coming over for dinner wasn’t part of the plan. You can’t possibly think it’s reasonable for your GF to give you an immediate response when she’s with other people. 15 minutes is an adequate response time. How would you feel if your GF was immediately responding to texts/calls from her friend?"
d7eqvl,"NAH - At least you were honest. You would’ve been an asshole if you distanced yourself and didn’t explain why. I completely understand why they’re upset, though - there’s nothing they can do about the feelings and they’re powerless, so naturally, they’ll resent you for “ruining” the friendship. But you also can’t help your feelings."
d7euww,"NAH.  It doesn't sound like you've actually specifically *asked* her to stop doing things like mowing the lawn and such.  She's not psychic.  She thinks she's being nice and neighborly and tons of people would be thrilled to have a neighbor who does these things.  So she's not TA.  You're not TA for disliking the invasion of your personal space.  But you need to specifically say ""thank you for these things, but we would like you stop.  We can handle it, and we prefer to do it ourselves.  Please don't do it anymore."""
d7ezc0,"You’re in the right for speaking up and telling him privately to deal with his hygiene. But embarrassing him publicly and humiliating him is taking it way too far. Sorry man, YTA here."
d7f1xr,"NAH - You are going through a very difficult time right now. While it may be selfish - you are *allowed* to be selfish. You need to protect you and your own emotional well-being. They have every right to be upset, but if they love you, they will get over it and hopefully understand one day."
d7f3v6,"NTA-Yes, you may have decreased its monetary value if you attempted to sell it but in this case I think sentimental value is more important than anything monetary. Not to mention, it’s yours to do with as you wish without family input because it isn’t their business."
d7f4x7,"

YTA.

You know, I could understand more if this was about not wanting to add plastic to the environment (yes, I'm that person 😂) but even so, it sounds more controlling than anything else and that's where I take issue.

Compromise and get her a damn Brita filter or something? Don't be so cheap when she's doing her part for your family. Ffs, it's water...not a Fendi bag."
d7f7cw,"NTA.

I mean, you don't explicitly NEED to mack your bf in front of his parents, but it's not like you were humping him or anything. She needs to lighten the hell up, especially given the situation. 

P.S. ""Messing with my boyfriend's heart rate monitor"" paints a VERY different picture than your story."
d7f7rd,"INFO: Do you still have feelings/could they come back any time soon? If so, YTA for knowingly meeting with someone in a 5 year relation in such a way."
d7fsfl,"NTA, your boyfriend and his friends sound like pigs. Are you very young? Because I can't imagine anyone older than a teenager pointing out well-endowed women in public. How gross and immature. There's a huge difference between instinctively looking at an attractive person and ogling."
d7fv6c,"NTA for wanting to stop supporting your parents. But you mentioned how your parents left your medical issues untreated and you struggle with memory loss and suffered until you were able to go out on your own and get answers. They’re doing the same thing to the dog. While at the end of the day it’s up to you, the dog may suffer the way you had to for years since your parents are obviously unfit to care for anything. The dog is aggressive, but it’s old and sick and will suffer for the rest of its life if you give it back to your parents."
d7fvu1,NTA. You're being taken advantage of.
d7fwra,"As stated above, they have driven stick before."
d7fz3u,[deleted]
d7fz3x,"NAH

Just tell them WHY you don’t want to do it that day. Maybe don’t use cancel, try reschedule. There’s no reason you can’t do something the next available weekend."
d7g5vt,"Hmm. I'm gonna say NTA. Up until I read that he had lied, I thought you were TA. 


While I think I might've wanted to talk about it a bit more before telling him to just cut it off, I don't think that's an inappropriate reaction. Also, if you're considering leaving, then maybe follow that feeling. I suspect he's broken your trust before"
d7g6pm,NTA. Those friends of yours are lousy people on this respect.
d7g965,"NTA  If people don't want their clothes touched, they should stay with them til they're done or at least time the load and come back before it's necessary for someone else to move them."
d7g9lj, YTA.   He has a right to come into his own room.
d7g9sb,NTA you don’t gotta go to a funeral for someone you barely even know. If you don’t want to and will feel uncomfortable then don’t go.
d7gahu,"NTA. Your dad isn't acknowledging your feelings or accommodating your schedule, and that is frustrating. 

You need to be clear about this if you're telling him that. ""I don't want to come over on weekends because there is an erratic scheduled that makes it difficult for me to do x, y and z."" Don't just tell him your unhappy, give the why, and don't fall into the trap of qualifying further and the conversation spiralling out of control - and give him the chance to do something about it."
d7geeu,"You're not TA for rehoming and doing what's best for the dog, but YTA for getting a dog while in college and without having a stable living situation."
d7gim3,"NTA. Your child, your rules. I wanted to go with NAH, but  her eye-rolling and scoffing says that she is just disrespectful. 
Talk to her about it though, say how you feel and lay out your conditions. Don't threaten her, but let her know what the consequences are if your feelings about this don't change."
d7gkh2,"NAH - You’re uncomfortable with a situation. It’s natural to want to avoid the uncomfortable things in life. However, you can’t avoid things forever, and unless you are concerned your birth mom will be abusive, I’d suggest going. These types of activities are what are required in life: things that seem trivial and uncomfortable can end up being important later. If it’s not okay or you feel in danger, you can leave."
d7gri6,"NTA. I think you’d be more of TA if you did tell the wife, as it would cause unnecessary drama, over something that might not be true. Maybe Mike is just friendly, or maybe he does have feelings. But as long as he doesn’t act on them, there’s no reason to go running to his wife making claims that you don’t even know are true."
d7gudr,"NTA

 seems reasonable enough. I think they over reacted . I don’t understand why they would be upset ."
d7gvzu,">I felt really good because she really pissed me with her ""registration fee"".

YTA.  It isn't ""her"" fee."
d7gwgd,"YTA. You will just be bringing up bad memories for her and continue being the asshole. Leave her alone for God’s sake.

It’s still all just about you, isn’t it?"
d7gykn," NTA and I think you’re right that she lied about going to the police. If they never contacted you, it’s likely she was lying. If your mom thinks it’s ok to hang out with a man that hurt her daughters then she needs to be shown that’s not alright."
d7gzbu,"NTA

 Fuck them."
d7h3fd,"NTA. If Katie doesn’t want to call him dad, she doesn’t have to, regardless of how fatherly he acts towards her. He didn’t need to pick a fight about it with her, it’s hard enough being a kid with divorced parents as it is. Fighting with her about it & him trying to make her feel guilty for it sure as hell isn’t going to make her want to call him dad, it’s only going to drive a wedge between them. What he did was wrong & he isn’t owed the title of dad just because he stuck around. She still sees her dad & you’ve said they seem to have a good relationship so him throwing out the whole “he left both of you” is fucked up to even say.

I’m adding that I think he owes Katie an apology for how he handled the situation. He’s entitled to his own feelings & I can understand being hurt, but at the end of the day he’s a grown man & she’s just a kid."
d7h72n,Yta for leaving your kid with someone you know has unchecked substance abuse issues. But absolutely remove this person from your home and being around your child.
d7h7kp,"ESH, but devil's advocate just do it."
d7hb21," NAH, like, you try to fix the relationship by trying to talk it out, while she tries to fix it by not making a fuzz about petty stuff you both said when you were heated.

You wanting an apology from her just shows how emotionally dependent you are on her, same with the breakdown. Try to get out with other people more."
d7hhgo,NTA.  She wants your attention.
d7hn4w,"It’s very difficult to assess whether you are *THE* asshole in this story, without actually having been there.

But everything above “Main story”, in your post is totally irrelevant, except to indicate that you are indeed *AN* asshole, with a chip on your shoulder about something.

So I’m gonna give the benefit of the doubt to the intern, and go with YTA."
d7hnh3,"YTA- your father is purposely calling your son by the wrong name because he didn’t get his way, your letting him be an AH to your wife. If he had called him Jack, or something short then ok maybe she’s overreacting, but he’s having a tantrum. What about when your son get older and doesn’t want to be called JR is your dad going to respect that? Does he ever use your sons actual name? Or is he just being an ass every time because he didn’t get what he wants? Your dad doesn’t get to pick the baby’s name and doesn’t get to disrespect your wife because he doesn’t like it. It’s not really about just the name, it about respecting you and your wife as adults who can make their own choices, especially when it comes to naming your own child. You should at least tell him that it bothers you and your wife, don’t point fingers at her and make her the bad guy. Even if the name doesn’t bother you, it bothers her and he’s doing it on purpose. That alone should bother you."
d7hs5p,"YTA 

Yikes on several fucking bikes"
d7ht59,"YTA. Nobody cares about your personal issues as much as you do. There's nothing wrong with having a discussion and expressing your preferences to people and telling them how you see yourself, but you're going above and beyond that into full lecture mode. You're literally making your gender your entire identity, and won't shut the fuck up about it.

It's kinda like those asshole vegans who won't shut up about how vegan they are. It's god damn annoying.

Literally nobody cares about your personal issues as much as you do. So try talking about something else instead of unloading your verbal diarrhea on somebody who's heard it dozens of times before already."
d7hv3g,"NAH. Your mother sounded really eager to share something with you and she did it without consulting you first, but that doesn't make her an asshole; nor are you for not wanting to go."
d7hwch,"Word choice my guy, sometimes it isn't what you say but how you say it. It's like going to eat at at a 5 star restaurant and getting a filet mignon and having it show up at the table looking like the Salisbury steak from the Banquet microwave meals. If need be, buy a thesaurus to find better words to use. Good Luck With The Conversation!!!"
d7hwe7,"'Not wanting to be a bother' - NTA

I understand this may come off as harsh but stand up for yourself OP. You may not need sleep but them staying up that late is probably bothering more people than just you.

A lot of bad things in this world happen because 'people just dont want to be an inconvenience to someone'. I'm not saying bad things happen in the world because of you, that would be wrong. I am saying though, you can learn to prevent things by actually saying 'no this isn't okay' when something isn't okay.

Causing that much noise past hours in a *dormitory* (of all places) is not okay."
d7i7n7,"Nta. Sounds like a typical power tripping middle manager dickhead. If they want you to not read notes that will help you attain a degree to move up in the world, they should pay a lot more and give you your breaks"
d7i7xb,"YTA 

This is typical teenaged angst. You'll grow out of it."
d7ib05,"NTA, these games are made to be addictive to kids. In game purchases in games for children are just nasty. 
Seems like it got to her big time. If she stole her parents credit card for this game, maybe it was a good idea, that she could not get to the game for a week."
d7ibdm,"NTA. It sounds like your neighbors wanted to feed the cat and enjoy its company and let their kids mess with it, but they did not want to take responsibility for the shots and vet care that it needed. I think it was kind of you to take in the cat."
d7idun,"Yta. You can’t force your brother to have a relationship with someone he has no interest in having one with. If you want to spend time with your dad, that’s fine, but your brother doesn’t owe you or your father that relationship."
d7if7m,Yta. Someone else’s undergarments or lack thereof is none of your business nor is it something you should be commenting on.

She didn't take it when she moved and I'm guessing those of you still in the house are glad to be keeping it.  As such, her responsibility ended when she left the family home.

You're not an asshole for not liking the picture, they're not assholes for using literally the only option they had to include you in the gift. 

Solution: wedding anniversary retakes. Small BBQ, family from both sides, cheap white dress on you, professional photographer for an hour at the start.

You already expressed your reservations to your supervisor so if you call out sick you best believe she'll know you're faking and it will probably impact your career given she has told you everyone is expected to be there.

This situation is so sad. 

You're making this about you. It isn't about you. 

This little girl is 12, and her home life is fucked. Of course she's acting out. Puberty is probably beginning to hit her like a ton of bricks, which isn't going to make her the most clear-headed person. This is when she needs the adult figures in her life to be stable, and you're being a petty asshole. Her bio-dad has been MIA, and now he's showing interest in her life. To her, this is a big deal. 

Her mom doesn't seem to have a solid idea on how she wants you to fill a fatherly role in her daughter's life. And they're both right: You're not her dad. But that doesn't mean you can't fill a fatherly role. 

Your girlfriend sucks because she clearly can't co-parent effectively, this girl's bio-dad sucks for being absent for so long, and you suck for being an inconsistent and unstable father figure. 

You and your girlfriend need to sit down and have a serious conversation about how parenting is going to work in your household. If you can't come to an arrangement that works for you both, you need to break up or go to a therapist until you can find something that works for everyone. Because the only one who is losing here is this little girl. 

Parenting is hard. Suck it up. Get used to being yelled at by teenagers. They're going to say and do things that crush your heart. It's awful. But it passes. And this is when she needs stability the most."

But I do have to say that she also has culture on her side. In most English-speaking countries, it is traditional for women to take their husband's name. Usually the husband is the one pushing for the woman to take her husband's name, not the other way around. 

I definitely understand you not wanting to change your name. There is a lot of identity in your name. But it is somewhat unreasonable to not let your wife take your name, especially if it means a lot to her.

Perhaps a compromise? You could possibly keep your name and she could be Brookeston-Helmutsson or something like that. That way, you make it clear that she isn't *really* Helmutsson but you and her still share a name.

No judgement for me."

When I was 9 my Dad asked us to stop telling our Mom all the stuff he bought us, because she had accused him of ""buying our love"". This whole situation crushed me. It made me doubt every gift I ever received again from both parents. It made me stop being honest with my Mom AND my Dad about things I liked or wanted (like a friend's new bike, or clothes I saw while out shopping) because I didn't want to mention anything that cost money. This was a lot for a 9 year old to live with. And it stayed with me for years.

If you found it offensive, it would be far better to just tell them that and ask them not to tease you about it than to go on bearing a grudge. Don't make a big drama out of it, though.

Maybe you could go see a dog trainer together, all three of you? Or better still, invite one to come see you at your GF place. That way they can see the dog in their own environment and hopefully give GF some insight in what the right course of action for this dog is.

You're not wrong for selling it. We talk all the time in this sub about how your inheritance is yours to do with as you please. It's yours, you get to make the choice.

Now you just gotta decide if you're ok with that."
d7qnij,"NTA. I’m going against everyone else here and saying that. 

Of course it’s okay to be upset about this. My dad tossed everything from my room when I was only eighteen years old, and I wasn’t even there for it. He threw away dozens of my journals from my entire life, ones I was planning on using for a memoir I wanted to write. He got rid of my entire childhood, and it still bums me out as a 24 year old. 

Anyone saying that you are an asshole for being upset about this is cruel, in my opinion. It’s one thing to ask if it’s okay to demand your mother not do whatever she wants with the room. It’s another thing entirely to ask if it’s okay to be upset and hurt by this.

You’re going through a lot of changes at once. Your mom just added this on top of everything else. In my opinion, she should have waited until you were a little more settled into your adult life. 

People on this sub seem to think that the transition to adulthood is immediate and that parents have no obligation to their children. While this might be true legally, I personally don’t think the law dictates whether or not someone is an asshole.

EDIT: Yep, NTA. I wish more people on Reddit weren’t so quick to side with authority figures. Your edit is awful and I’m so sorry that you’re in this situation. If it helps at all, the reason my dad got rid of my childhood room was for house renovations for a new wife. So, sort of relatable."
d7qsjo,">initially when he moved back I started calling him “babe” and cuddling with him

Oh honey. This whole thing was a mistake. He shouldn't be living with you. You shouldn't be supporting him financially. The lines here are obviously very blurred, and while he sounds like a colossal jerk, you did give him the impression that you were reconciling with him as a husband.

I would have hoped by now you've moved on with her and, at this moment in your life, she is the love of your life. You really can't compare how much you love each person because of who they are you love them in different ways and you love them for different things. May I suggest counseling?

Her friend was treating you like the sexual abuser she thinks you are

You're reacting like the innocent party you know yourself to be. 

The only piece of shit here is your ex who chooses to lie about sexual abuse so that she can feel like she won the breakup.

 ( To petty people winning breakups is important. Since you showed less emotional impact and wanted to stay friends, she felt slighted. As though your relationship meant less to you than it did to her. This is why she turned cold, and likely why she eventually lied. Everything you take in stride is a tack in this girl's shoe)"

d7rifu,"NTA and screw them. You were making sure your wife was safe. That's not being misogynistic and controlling, that's being a good husband. I'd honestly never trust those friends to be responsible ever again. You should have taken your wife home with you rather than leaving her with the friends who treated you that way, though.

Edit to add on: Nvm, I see that you walked home, my bad. That explains leaving her there since it was safest."
d7rju6,NTA. You probably could have said it nicer but seriously thank you for sticking up for that poor girl at the counter.
d7ronp,"NTA. ""Forcing"" a person to say thank you is something a parent does as soon as their child is articulate enough to say the words. I know pre-verbal babies who sign ""thanks."" It's not too much to expect a 20-year-old to demonstrate appropriate gratitude.

Especially if you're looking for work, you don't want to burn any bridges, so it might be best to say, thank you so much, but I don't think this role is a good fit for me and I don't want to waste your time.

And you're not TA because of course that's super weird and creepy and crosses some very weird lines I didn't even know existed.

Cab you try to talk to them when its not ""in the moment?""  Tell them what they mean to you, that you'd love for them to have an *honorary* place in your child's life, because as you said, who couldn't use more grandparents?  But also firmly say that they need to recognize that your child has a father, and that as much as you cared for their son, he isn't a part of the child's life.  I don't know.  Something like that.  You're in a tough spot."
d7su5t,"NTA. Maybe she reacted the way she did because of your tone, though. You should work out the grocery issue sometime when there no pressure (meaning, you don't need groceries right then) and come to an agreement that both of you are happy with. It's not fair that it all falls on you."

NAH. Your parents sound weirdly strict and maybe uneven in care but without understanding the reasoning idk that anything sounds abusive. 

But when you are an adult and pay your own way you then establish peer to peer relationship with your parents - and yes one of those choices available to you is cutting them out. 

I think what you describe certainly suggests you need to lay some guidelines down with them and apparently have tried/failed, if you really feel you have tried as much as is fair then sure move on. If I were you I would probably try a little more once you actually have moved out, you would be in a more adult/firm place to negotiate from."

And you still have the right to feel the way you feel. These people don’t know your sister like you do. And if you’re giving her money to live there, you’re paying rent. She’s not 100% just doing you a favor by letting guy live there. You’re contributing and deserve to have respect for that. Sounds like she is treating you more like a kid of hers or something other than an independent adult that you are. I wouldn’t tell her that you’re not going to speak with her for awhile because that will just cause more drama. Just tell her you’re moving over and gradually don’t speak to her. If you say anything about her behavior before you go I would just say “hey, so this really isn’t working for the both of us and I think you know that. I have found a place and I’m living out on xyz.

d7x2kb,"NTA. We all put reasonable limitations on our hobbies. For instance, you say that you’re obsessed with albums. Is your collection an absolute mess? Do you leave broken records around the house for other people to step on? Do you take care of your records, make sure that they’re in good condition/not scratched? Do you put them away when you’re done listening to them, or leave them all over the floor in haphazard piles? Does your collection spill over into other people’s spaces? Do you get new records yet have no idea where to put them and show no interest in keeping them organized? Do you listen to Nine Inch Nails on full blast every night while other people are trying to sleep?

It doesn’t sound like you do. And that’s what differentiates you from your sister.

It’s one thing to have interests—that’s good. But your sister leaving stuff all over the house, letting it stick to clothes, putting it near the pets? That’s out of control, and it’s directly harming other people. What I think she should do is make herself a Slime Corner—take all the slime in the house and confine it to one particular place—bedroom, basement, etc—where she can go when she wants to hang out and destress by playing with her slime. Not only will this make the house much cleaner, it ensures that your sister won’t need to make more slime and smuggle it into the house. It will be her responsibility to keep it clean and organized, and if she can’t do that, she loses the privilege. I think that’s a fair compromise."

None of what you’ve described here seems to warrant that severe of a reaction, so I’m inclined to think he’ll get over it eventually.

I know it seems like she’s being spiteful now but just anything that would have made her feel like a brief priority might have mitigated this situation a bit better
d7z9mv,"NTA but no one should do that task alone if it’s as sketch as you say. Doesn’t matter if it’s a guy or girl, should be at least 2 and maybe get a camera out back"
d7zckf,[deleted]
d7zdsy,"NTA. Stop giving her cash and pay the bills directly. Only way to ensure they get paid. 

just out of curiosity, is there a substance abuse issue at play here?"
d7zeka,Sounds like BIL needs a psychiatric evaluation
d7zhbu,"You are saying those things to the wrong person. Your dad is a manipulative, selfish piece of shit. He destroyed your family, his mistress was only an accomplice. With that said, as long as you don't threaten her or harass her I say go at it. Really rip that bitch to shreds

Nta"
d7zjfn,"NAH. You guys had a respectful conversation it seems from how you worded this post, even if you guys disagreed. Not sure why this was posted here. Belongs more in r/relationship_advice"
d7zjr5,NAH but you are over reacting.  It is not your property.  It belongs to the business not you.  They coworker is trying to rile you and get you spun up.  Which you are.  Which means they now know your button to push. Take a step back and let it go. Getting all pissy will not solve anything and the coworker (who is an asshole) will try it again.
d7zjxq,"NAH. Remember that there is a big difference between the ages of 23 and 30 in terms of maturation and growth, and where you are in your life stage.  it’s a big deal for a 23 year old to go to his parents and tell them he’s in a serious relationship with someone 7 years older than him with 2 kids. 

It’s not a bad thing, but his parents, like you said, may not approve or understand. I would sit down with him and have a conversation about why it’s important to you and see where it goes. You can also discuss incorporating him into your children’s lives too. I wish the best for both of you!"
d7zlzi,"YTA, it's not fair or reasonable to expect one woman to be your entire emotional support system.  It's totally normal between friends that other stuff will come up and you cancel plans on each other from time to time, as long as one person isn't doing it frequently or just failing to show up, which doesn't sound like the case at all here.  If you want someone to book time to listen to you vent on demand you should be paying a professional therapist.  

She has already made the effort to mend things and you're still sulking, its childish and if I was her honestly I'd cut you loose."
d7zpjn,NTA. I think it’s time to call CPS. The child won’t get taken away for something like this but it’ll be on record just in case.
d801yq,"NTA, You cooked extra for her, if she doesn't like it then tough tiddies, she can make their own food without being so awful about it.

Edit: making it clearer"
d8037a,"YTA. You want money from him for what?? Are you skint? I don’t understand why you want him to split it. It’s not in your name, it’s in his, so it’s his money. I imagine you get paid more than 16k, so what are you going to give him?

Technically he’s not “doing nothing and getting his bills paid”. He’s in school ffs."
d803m0,"Eh. NTA. I think you could have phrased it better but you weren’t a dick for telling him to stop. (Obviously he either has a super good memory or water bottles are his hyperfixation, so he probably didn’t realize he was getting out of hand)"
d805x9,"NAH. It seems reasonable to be apprehensive, but I think you should talk with your roommate, express your concerns, and see what she has planned. 

It's really hard to find someone you're compatible enough to live with, so don't give up on this roommate until you're sure that she can't cut it financially."
d8066i,NTA fuck Amazon
d80a3u,"ESH  You for not cleaning up your space. Your brother for assaulting you. Your parents for shrugging it off. 

p.s. You need to call the cops when you're assaulted by another adult."
d80anf,"NTA. Your moms reaction was ridiculous. If this is how all significant others are handled in your home, I’m sure your brother realized what was going on before you said anything."

d80er1,"NTA - you didn’t intentionally snub her dietary restrictions, you just forgot. And it is unreasonable to expect people to eat in 90 degree heat in a nice restaurant."
d80iee,"NTA. 

You're an adult, you can move out at any time, and your parents moving to a house where there isn't an appropriate bedroom for you sounds like a *great* time to leave."

d80prd,"YTA.

If a person is being provided reasonable accommodation due to a medical condition and you don't like how it's handled, then you need to talk to a manager, not confront the disabled person. Slap on the wrist? This is the kind of thing that can get you fired."
d80sus,NTA  no notice means he cooks!
d80vhp,"Okay, long time T1D here. A partner bringing food isn't a substitute for your own prep.

Bring food, everywhere, this is like T1D for beginners level stuff here. 

NTA. I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that his snappy-ness is just low bloodsugar. He is still the asshole here. That is a good way to die.

Edit: The number of people blaming OP or assuming OP didn't intentionally bring food is too damn high. I have been at this a long time, you have to be fully responsible for yourself or you will die. The help of a spouse/partner is fantastic and helpful, them bringing their own stash of backup food is great, but if you are going to count on it you have to make sure it is there. The husband didn't ask if she brought food first, he just assumed. This is on him."
d80w3d,"NTA  


Employers are often unfair and dicks. Don't be surprised if you're fired despite you being reasonable and asking reasonable questions, like, ""Am I supposed to be working today?"" Still try and act in good faith, but start making timestamped records of what is going on. If you need unemployment for example, you don't want them to be able to claim you no-called no-showed, when in fact, you called asking if you were supposed to work and no one gave you an answer."
d80x9z,[deleted]
d80xuz,"Personally I think YWBTA.

Even if you choose not to participate in the gifting, I don't think you should take away your families tradition or their right to buy your kids gifts. Yes its excessive consumerism and the gifts are quickly forgotten but your family only gets together once a year and they want to bring a little joy to your kids. I'd let them have this one thing. If you don't want to take the gifts home drop them at a shelter or thrift store before boarding the plane."
d80ymq,YTA - “non-negotiable” isn’t a great stance to take when it comes to disagreements in a relationship.  Your girlfriend has made it clear this is important to her. Not being open to even compromising or exploring options that you are BOTH satisfied with is an asshole move.
d80yne,NTA. Your parents can get the fuck over it. Good luck with your transition! ♡
d81134,"YTA It's not your house, so it's not your problem. Your parents get to decide what happens with your stepbrother, not you. Don't like it (him) find your own place. Sorry...."
d813eb,Not an asshole for telling your mother to step off. Asshole for having a cash bar!
d8156g,"YTA. I came into this thread ready to give you a big huge not the asshole, but I changed my mind after reading. You moved the clothes after just one minute, and the dude ended up coming in right behind you. It seems like he was conscious of his dryer use, and he was coming just in time to get his clothes. 

>What should I do, waste five to ten minutes sitting around waiting for a guy that might not show for twenty?

Yes. Wait 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, you're totally good."
d8165c,YTA - You say you never lost trust in him then immediately jump to the conclusion that he might be cheating on you because he danced with a female friend.  There’s also that key piece where he turned down a girl that was hitting on him.  Sounds to me like he is trustworthy and your just insecure.
d818d6,NTA. Your friend needs to 1) place blame where it goes not the innocent girl 2) stop pretending this guy is magically gonna love her back and 3) drop the slut shaming bs
d81c9q,">The problem is that they're always ready to get louder and angrier when they're challenged. 

NTA. At the very least, learning how to have a discussion without getting aggressive about it is a life skill they need to learn, and you're not attackinging *them*, as it were, just challenging what they're saying."
d81f6y,"YTA

There are bad aspects to all jobs.  And it's more than fair to tell them about them - long hours, reasonable expectations of pay, and it's WORK to become one.  

But saying ""become a surgeon and look forward to your gf cheating on you"" was over the line.  

Also - from your writing style you seemed to take pleasure in crushing this kids dreams.  What is wrong with you?"
d81fch,"NTA. It's your room and you don't want dog shit in it, I don't see why your mom has a problem with that."
d81jsr,[removed]
d81mkg,"YTA.  This story makes no sense, but regardless, yes, you are the asshole for making plans without bothering to check if you are free.  When someone asks to set a date for something and you agree, there is an understanding that both of you are free then."
d81n9n,"YTA, nothing suggests she is crying for attention so you are just being a jerk."
d81oo0,"NTA there is only so much one can take  just look up some of the craziest parts in the bible to fire back politely (several lists in google) that is always fun

d81qzf,"NAH 

You brushed off the mental illness part. Need to know more about that

Edit: I switched my vote from info to no ones an asshole. I see why you could hold a bit of resentment. Aspergers is mild but it messes with your ability to socialize. It also cause people to be repetitive and essentially form habits, that if messed with could cause the person to freak out. 

I don’t think either of you are a holes but I can definitely see where you are coming from. Just know that life is undetermined and petty stuff like this shouldn’t keep you from trying to talk to your bro."
d81zbf,"NTA

All you had to eat was that soup, while they had a full meal.  No reason for them to all start eating from your bowl.  While this is not a huge deal, I  can certainly understand why you got upset under the circumstances."
d81zge,"NTA 

If it's not working then it's not working. I'd argue that this should usually be a group decision, but being GM is a ton of extra work that you shouldn't have to put in for someone who doesn't appreciate it."
d8224n,YTA why even make that comment
d827rq,I would take this over to the legal advice sub to bet a better idea as to what to do in this situation. This isn't exactly the place for it.
d82901,"YWBTA - If you just come straight out with ""I don't care about your love life"" then yes, YWBTA. But that's because there's steps you can take first, like just saying ""Hey I really don't have the capacity to sit through you ranting about this."" It's not that you're wrong to set boundaries, because you definitely SHOULD set one here, but she is obviously having a rough time, so at very least, be clear about why you're setting up the boundary: Your own well being.

I get that it's been really frustrating, and that you don't have fun hanging out when she shuts everything down you try to talk about, and I'm not gonna lie, she's definitely in the wrong for doing so, but I still have to say YTA if you come right back with, essentially, ""shut up"" while your friend is having a hard time.

Maybe try saying you can't deal with actively handling that situation, that's why you yourself don't date, after all, but you'd be happy to help her get her mind off of it by doing something else. And if she can't accept that, you're perfectly within reason to say ""Then I really can't help you the way you need, you'll have to find someone else to talk through it with.""

And if she pushes? Ending the friendship isn't unreasonable. Just communicate and give her a chance to fix her behavior first."
d82a2b,"NTA, he should get a clue, you don’t ask for a larger tip, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SONT DESERVE ONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. when movers damage your stuff they don’t get tipped, plain and simple."
d82bvd,"NTA You have an incredibly manipulative family. You are busting your ass for the family business, doing what your father asked you to do, then they are making you feel guilty about it. That's called gaslighting dude. They keep moving the goal post. Seriously? A second party and cake for your dad that you now have to plan? Hell no! Next time, follow your schedule and don't compromise with them. If they want you someplace at a certain time, they better be clear and any request to deviate or ask you to do someone should be met with a curt, ""this is my availability, I can't change it."""
d82c76,NTA no backsies
d82gaz,"NTA. Sounds like she's emotionally blackmailing you and cutting off contact seems the smartest way to go, she's definitely not entitled to your love if she treats you horribly"
d82ut8,"YTA. He wants to leave for his safety, the safety of your relationship, and wanting him to stay there is possibly a sign that you value the money more than the relationship.

ME is an incredibly stressed right now and anything means, like you said, your BF would be stick there and potentially be drafted into war. He wants to leave for his and your safety and from an unadulterated view, you’re an asshole for wanting to place him in a place that can start a war within a days notice."
d82x0t,"NTA- It's not as if you had invited her and then decided last minute she couldn't go along. She's not entitled to your time. I understand feeling left out, but it's better than feeling like a third wheel on a trip that's supposed to be fun and that you can't just go home from very easily. It sounds like her joining would've turned the whole trip into nothing but stress and a waste of time and money."
d82xs7,YTA Being drunk doesn't excuse anything. You should probaly tell her because she will know of it eventually
d831ng,"NTA

No one wants to get murdered at night. Your roommates need to understand that they’re in the big city now and there will always be consequences to their actions at some point. It’s drastic but I would maybe research the break in in your area. Seeing it on paper may change their minds. If they refuse to change then I suggest either finding others to fill their positions or selecting new accommodation."
d833lu,"YTA but it was so close to being no assholes until you said ""she's going to your mother's and that's final"".

I understand not wanting a kid at the birth, my birth was so traumatic my dad wouldn't go to my younger brothers, but ""that's final"" is a dick move"
d839dy,NTA - Everyone doesn't have to do it her way. If you asked nicely and she doesn't then ask her rudely.  Sadly that's the only way some people get it. She's being disrespectful.
d83bx3,"YTA for nagging her about it.  You're free to want and ask, but when you start repeatedly asking despite knowing the answer, you're being an asshole to some extent.  You knew who she was when you got married.

I agree with you though, smokers generally smell bad to non-smokers."
d83e6g,"YTA a little bit. 

>This is something we've talked about doing together, the shared idea of doing a long trip someday was one of the first things that brought us together 

You going alone has got to be pretty hurtful for him. I think if you both feel this strongly about it, and have shared the dream, you need to find a way to do it together, even if that means waiting for next year or the year after."
d83g0p,"NTA. How much money either of you makes is irrelevant. Two consenting adults made an agreement, they should be held to it. Also, they sound like a coward, avoiding you and probably pissed that you are demanding they do what they said they would."
d83kas,"NAH, but your plan of buying your parents' house needs thinking through. You haven't even graduated yet, and you don't know what your future will hold (except for the job you have lined up), but you're already planning to lock up the money you don't have in a house for someone else? What happens if you want to move to another city, or start a family? Will your parents pay you rent? What if you have financial issues and need to sell the house your parents live in? Are they comfortable knowing this will be ""your house, your rules?"" If your dad builds the house, who makes all the decisions pertaining to the design, build, landscaping, interior decoration? What happens if your parents want your sister to live in the house and you don't?"
d83opm,NTA she’s a big girl she needs to take care of her own shit.
d83ut0,YTA...your brother’s kids. Follow his lead. Whatever he wants to do you do
d83w8s,"I think NAH. I really don’t see how you were meant to do anything. If you shouted it out or told her during the performance somehow it just would’ve been majorly embarrassing.

Telling her after just makes her feel bad and crushes the fact she thought she’d done well.

I really don’t think it was up to you to tell her, and at first the laughing did make her feel like she was doing a good job. You were meant to laugh, just not at what some people might have been."
d83y4b,"NTA. There’s nothing wrong with going alone and she has repeatedly said she’s fine with it. 

It sounds like her friends are calling you weird and it’s making her uncomfortable. Which is kind of fucked up, because she should be on your side."
d83yo7,"NTA in that scenario, but absolutely TA for reminding me about Momo"
d83yv5,You’d be the asshole if you’re wrong and you accidentally kill him
d843gd,"YTA. 

This is a classic example of people on this sub getting stuff ridiculously wrong in their judgements. Moving down and making space for them is just a super easy, accommodating thing to do."
d847bh,"YTA your real problem here is that you don't want the wedding song to be ""gay"" and that's why you're pushing back. I don't think he was mocking your sister and her husband, he was mocking your obvious discomfort that their song could have been inspired by a man. If love is love what does it matter who the song was inspired by? Why does that change your enjoyment of the song? What about this made you push back so strongly? I don't think you're a bad person by any means, but I think this is homophobia showing. This doesn't mean you're homophobic, but you are showing homophobic thoughts. Instead of getting defensive, examine in yourself why that might be. (Also, for the record I am saying this from the perspective of a straight woman. We have been raised in a society in which these thoughts can become instinctive. That's why you have to take the opportunity to look at yourself and try to do better in the future."" 

It's also likely your friend has been positively impacted by the country singer coming out as gay and was frustrated by you invalidating that aspect of the singers identity. I mean he's gay, but he's not writing about men!... he most likely was ya know?"
d84czh,NTA I would've ghosted them after waiting an hour and just enjoyed the day with my girlfriend tbh.
d84fui,YTA. I'm willing to bet that your attitude - as I doubt this is an isolated incident - is at least part of the reason your kid didn't want to talk to you.
d84pe8,"NTA — the only asshole here is your mum for using adoption as a fear factor and saying other malignant phrases to you, designed to play with you. It's only natural that you would be jealous, you probably aren't even alone in feeling this. Were it not for your mother, this would be a NAH situation."
d84qhf,"NAH but I think it's a harmless lie to say that you don't fantasize about any of your colleague, even if you do. Some questions don't require complete honesty."
d84vsx,"YTA, you and the other elite players choose to be in a guild with lower level/""bad"" players. If you don't like the way they play, leave the guild. Don't spend a bunch of time trash talking them to other members. You claim that the people in the guild are really close to you, but you have no qualms about being mean to them in a public way. This is not how most people would treat their close friends. (The fact that you were mostly parroting the other elite people is completely irrelevant, you still said it)."
d850tf,NTA - I am personally very sensitive to smells but I would never tell anyone else to stop doing something that’s important to them. I’m not more important than them and my needs are not more important than theirs. I would just leave the situation but insure that person that “it’s me and not you” kinda thing.
d855lk,"I'm not sure I'd say you were necessarily TA by going initially, given that she wasn't that ill and told you to go (I'm assuming here that she genuinely meant it, and this isn't you leaving out the fact that it was grudgingly), although frankly, it seems somewhat selfish to still go when it's something that, by your own admission, you do every weekend, and you know exactly how miserable malaria can be.

However, knowing that your girlfriend was ill, I do think that you're definitely TA for then going out to dinner, meaning that you were away for 15 hours.

Also, YTA for comparing how you feel to how she feels, and trying to minimise how ill and miserable she was - it doesn't matter who had it worse, she gave up her time to stay with you, and you couldn't even give up going for dinner to get back and see how she was.

Your 'friend' is also TA for not checking in on someone who was ill without explanation."
d85ayr,"NTA 
That piece of shit deserves whatever consequences come his way, why the fuck would you cut your classmate, with a blade that is somewhat dull and most definitely uncleaned. Disgusting. He sounds like an annoyance from the start honestly."
d85c5g,ESH because the issue with the beds seems to be a symptom of a much larger issue. Talk to your parents and work through the underlying issues as you seem to be on very different pages.
d85dzz,"... Wow. My condolences for the family you were born into.

NTA."
d85h72,"YTA. The previous arrangement she had with her former roommates have nothing to do with the arrangement she has with you. If I understand correctly, you did not pay last months rent when you moved in. If you are on the lease and you owe rent for the month of October then you need to pay that rent."
d85hna,"NTA - for one, you've planned this with your friends from Uni, and it's your vacation as a group. Not only would it probably slightly disrupt the group dynamic you've got going if you brought in someone they're not as familiar with, but he would likely also feel slightly out of place and it would be on you to make sure he feels included, etc., which would impact your enjoyment. Him pressuring you into including him makes him a bit of TA."
d85i87,YTA he's I'll. The virus is already in the house. And you can move out just as easy.
d85q1k,"Info: 

Why do you feel the need to post it on Facebook? What are you getting out of it?

Edit: YWBTA, dont snap at people when they're right."
d85v1r,"YTA , if you wanted to be recognized then maybe remind them ahead of time, but don’t expect people to keep you in mind 24/7. I think it says more about you as a friend to get upset about something so relatively insignificant as a birthday if you have been friends for many years."
d866da,"No one:
Absolutely no one:
OP: My husband did NOT hurt me and I WILL NOT explain further.

Also nta"
d869bg,"NTA. I think you could easily say that your memories of her are different than theirs and you would prefer to not talk about it. If you want to talk about how she negatively affected you, maybe therapy is the place for that."
d86cwz,This post is loaded with weird undertones and I honestly think your relationship is the problem and not the book...?
d86j75,"NTA. I think she's blowing this way out of proportion. It's a car. You drive it every day and have to deal with its bulk and the huge fuel cost of a big 7-seater. If you only all go out together once or twice a month, 2 cars is fine, and, as you said, you can rent a bigger one for trips."
d86sk7,Strongly leaning towards NTA. Getting verbally aggressive on him while your working wasn't wise but his behavior is odd as fuck. You know each other well enough that he slept at your house but he blatantly ignores you when your at work and has no explanation as to why? Incredibly bizarre.
d86u3q,"Your kid broke it, you pay for it. Don't wait to get fucking sued. YTA. Just some weak ""they'll touch it"", which doesn't even imply that your kids break that stuff, won't grant you absolution from legal consequences, obviously. If you really think this is how it works, you must be denser than a meteorite."
d86w67,"YTA. 

>She has a bit of a stutter and, to put it lightly, doesn't understand social cues.

Dude, she's not the one with the social problems. She can't help stuttering, and if she's making an effort to talk to classmates in spite of it, it sounds like she's working at it. You were really rude."
d86wik,"NTA

You're not obliged to be friends with anyone, or spend time with anyone. You've clarified that you aren't judging or being rude to them, just not spending time with them - that's great. There's no need to be rude as she will likely get over it at some point, but you also don't owe them your time or energy."
d86yk9,"NTA. You can’t get ‘cured’ of an eating disorder. Much like alcoholism or substance abuse, it’s a lifelong thing that people will struggle with (particularly since, as you pointed out, people who have eating disorders have to regularly consume food. They can’t stop eating)."
d870fs,"You would be.

Suck it up, best shiteating grin. Take one for the home team and remember to limit extra family meetings to minimum required though you lives unless your opinion of her improves.

From the sounds of it she likely got an earful from Doug later. If she persists then do explain the error of her ways to her in due course but right now if you do anything dramatic like that it will only end badly for you and your partner."
d871mw,"YTA - That 'lesson' isn't going to stick with him, you just wanted the candy. Let me tell you something that applies to both your little brother and your future girlfriends; they won't remember that you were right, they'll just remember how you made them *feel*.

Sometimes it is better to be kind than to be right."
d872ss,"YTA - you should probably move out, this shit sounds awfully dysfunctional. Your dad wasn't actually saying anything insulting, you've blown it out of proportion"
d87a4s,"YTA dude. He needed your support. You didn't have to go home then and there, but you could have been nicer. It's never too late to apologise."
d87hk3,"NTA

Of course you are upset. You are in a private space. You are allowed to be naked.

He needs to apologize for thinking so lowly of you."
d87jzi,There is so much irrelevant shit in this story I can't even finish it.
d87m75,There's more to the story.  You can't really expect a real answer with just a few bullets of your side of things.
d87mr0,"NTA you didnt have to get ice cream, and the older ones were fine sharing."
d87nz9,NTA- she should've made time and been there for you. You were going through a lot.
d87onl,"NTA. 

I reasoned in my head for a no asshole but I believe there are some potential assholes here: Possibly the parents could be considered as the assholes - it seems like they may have planned this accidental meet up without her, or your consent.

Even if their hearts were in the right place they've definitely made both of you go through some emotional whiplash.

In your case you clearly still have feelings for this girl - this post is probably more suited to a relationship advice and it's hard to say if you would be an asshole for reaching out to her. She may have feelings for you - but I think for your own well being you need a clear answer.

**However**

You should 100% make sure you are in a fit and proper state to make this choice. Do you still have ""days"" of drinking, or self doubt and depression where it could easily revert to your previous state of being?"
d87oqp,"NTA

I have 3 kids and I strongly believe in “sucking it up” and not catering to a child’s every tantrum. Because of this my kids are very well behaved and know that a tantrum won’t solve shit for them.

Anyway - best of luck OP! 

Also - when does your wife get a few days to herself? Just because she doesn’t work from home doesn’t mean transiting to/from work isn’t exhausting."
d87oy2,"YTA - you're at an interview, prove you can communicate instead of grabbing your phone to go on Reddit!"
d87qn5,"ESH. Yes, he should cover his mouth when he coughs, wash his hands frequently and dispose of his tissues. But he was pretty sick, so you could have been more sympathetic. And realistically, if you're sharing a living space with someone, you have a pretty high chance of picking up the flu even if he follows all the rules. You both handled this very badly by resorting to yelling and insulting each other. Illnesses are a fact of life, especially in close relationships. Be mature."
d87qxs,"NTA 
If you don’t want to talk to or have any contact with somebody, you don’t have to. If he asks you why, just say it’s because he’s a gamer."

The internet says basically EVERYTHING has a sudden risk of death, and it's totally okay for you to decline any substance at all for any reason but that isn't necessarily going to happen just because the internet says it's a possibility. I even understand being a little put out that night as it's not always fun to be around people who are on a drug you're not, but staying mad for the rest of the trip? You're just shooting yourself in the foot at that point. And bringing it up STILL after a year? I'm honestly curious what purpose that serves for you."

Yes, you can and should discuss things like anxiety and problems with your parents.  However, just take the word ""trash"" out of your vocabulary.

Does your boyfriend has a weird disease where the only way he could survive is by wearing ridiculously overpriced hoodies?  Because in that case, I can see him accepting it.

d8gep1,"Uh why is this child not in therapy for her destructive tendencies? Kids act out but the level of damage you're describing is absolutely not normal for a 6-year-old. She needs to be seeing a child psychologist to figure out what is going on. Most kids don't just constantly destroy things for destruction's sake. Either she's being abused or neglected at home or she has a mental/behavioral issue that isn't being addressed.

Hate to say, but having worked with a lot of kids her age, this behavior is extremely common in households with neglect or abuse. Especially how you describe her being more careful when appropriately disciplined and monitored. Any chance at all that's what's going on?"

Trust me, there is a point where the management company will step in and it will result poorly for you and your roommates. Instead of kicking him off the internet, which will most likely start an escalating war of roommate pettiness (been there done that,) how about you get your other roommate involved and have a come to Jesus talk with him.

YTA. You used what was probably a child's biggest fear because you couldn't be bothered to keep your emotions in check, like an adult. You stooped to the level of a literal child.

Tell her that you think she looks beautiful and you just can’t understand her discomfort. Reassure her that there is nothing to be embarrassed of in the dress. Do NOT tell her that her feelings don’t matter even if it’s just a stupid dress.

d8id4a,"> at the suggestion of her school, was advised to pull her out of normal classes and be put into special education classes for students with IEPs. They believe my daughter has low functioning autism despite no official diagnosis

Have they tested her? You need to request testing from the school, or find it locally with a psychologist. 

> She didn't learn to speak more than 5 words until she was 3, even now she has a very small vocabulary and is mostly nonverbal

If she is still mostly nonverbal, you need an updated professional opinion. 

> If she's in a normal school, eventually, she'll be ""normal"" herself. She'll learn to adapt.

Hard truth: If she has an intellectual, learning, or developmental disability, she will NOT simply become ""normal"" academically or socially. You would be doing her a disservice if you placed her in a situation where she would be set up to fail. I'm not saying that IS the case, because there doesn't appear to be sufficient evidence either way; therefore you need to obtain that evidence and make an informed decision. 

> My daughter expressed to both my ex-wife and I in private that she doesn't want to change school and she likes it where she is

I appreciate that you are taking her opinion into consideration, but what kid wants to change schools? What kid is eager to leave their predictable environment and venture into an unknown one? It's simply not a sufficient reason to decline this option. 

OP you aren't an asshole for this, nobody is. But you might be making a selfish and detrimental decision if you set your daughter up to fail. She needs formal testing (the WISC-V for intelligence, the WIAT-III for academic achievement, and the ADOS for autism spectrum, at the very least) from a professional who can inform you of her specific deficits, potential for growth, and qualification for LD/IDD/ASD diagnoses."
d8ii6d,"NTA- if somebody was really carjacked, they'd be freaking the f out and screaming for you to call 911. Your Spidey senses tingled that something wasn't right about his demeanor.

2. Your post nearly unreadable due to tour terrible grammar and lack of punctuation"
d8jjpp,NTA but your thread title is very misleading. You didn't end the friendship because her mom didn't want your bf staying over. You ended the friendship because Anna passively accepted her parents 'ruling' and avoided addressing this with you herself.

NTA,
If you didn't feel comfortable le being her MOH from the beginning you shouldn't have accepted (that's why I thought you might be an asshole too) but your friend seems awful and entitled. 

Also ""ruining her wedding for selfish reasons""? Its her wedding, her business, her thing. That's not on you! Your world doesnt spin around her because she's getting married, you clearly have better things to do."
d8jyrg,"NTA. It doesn't matter if it's $500 bucks or 25 cents, it's the principle that when someone is good enough to lend you money, you pay it back. Growing up poor one of the things I learned was the value of trust, and that when someone helps you, you make sure that you give back what you owe. Maybe he doesn't have the full sum right now, but if he even started making installments it'd be better than nothing.

People might say you're being petty to require a small sum back (I'd disagree), but even if you are being petty, he's the one willing to throw a friendship away rather than just give his friend what he's due."
d8k5fj,"NTA. 
Is he seriously mad at you for being honest about your feelings?"
d8k67d,"NTA

Sounds like your mom is betraying your mutual trust by snooping, which is totally out of line. You are 16 not 10, and that is a total lack of respect for privacy and trust.

I'm sure she was stressed, but you reap what you sow. 

Also, LOL googling baby names!"
d8k83f,"NTA, with D being kind of a dick here. ""...last chance to tell whay \[you\] know""? What are you, a naughty eight-year-old?

You promised V your confidence and discretion, which you delivered, which is laudable.

d8ka47,"Then yes - YTA. The school is legally responsible for you and can face shit from the education department, child safety, etc if anyone becomes aware that you left the school grounds without permission/knowledge.

It doesn’t seem like you intentionally led him on, but you were drunk, and lines get a little blurred. 

I’m gonna say NTA."
d8l6kt,"NTA.
I posted a version of this yesterday with respect to another posting:

Just a general bit of advice - never tell anyone what name you intend to give your future children. Chances are, someone close to you who has a child before you will pick that name or say they wanted that name and will try to pressure you to change. And that will lead to all sorts of heartache. KEEP BABY NAMES SECRET until the child is born."
d8le7d,ESH but I think your parents suck the most
