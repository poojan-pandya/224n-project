d9x47o,"NAH, someone has a job that needs to be done. They offer it to you, you decline because you're not interested.  This is how things work, not sure how anyone in this story is the asshole, besides maybe the original sitter.

Probably we need more info here. Why can't the parents look after their oen kids on Friday night and until they find a new sitter?"
d9xgfv,"ESH

It would be very interesting to hear what happened from your dads wife's point of view.  I have the feeling you are leaving a bit out of the story.

Have you communicated anything with your dads wife? Did you ask her to make your dress and did you offer to pay for her work? 

How would you feel if somebody asks for your skills and then said, ah, I don't want them after all but you could make this small thing for me instead? Again, did you offer to pay her for the cloak?

Your wedding is in January and you're thinking about your dress now but asked your dads wife half a year ago to make your dress. And then you didn't care to talk to her about it since?

It's your wedding, you can wear whatever you want, but don't expect others to cater to your whim, especially if you don't communicate well."
d9xgin,"Nta, you have no obligation to maintain a friendship if you don't like them"
d9xr7d,"YTA, this was a man that obviously was more interested in your life then you were in his, as he gave you a present every year even though you didn't see him often. If you can fly out for your friends you can definitely do it out of respect for someone who was there all of your life. Your mom also notices this and I don't blame her."
d9xspp,">She says she was trying to protect me by not telling me she slept with him, even though I had asked her a few times before.

d9xw3t,"YTA. And pretty bigly.

Your words:

> I was smiling for the first time in ages 

Your partner’s words:

> You're finally smiling. It's good to see you in a good mood for a change

So somebody who cares about you, who has seen you unhappy and in pain for some time, comments that it’s *nice* to see you happy, and this upsets you? WHY? Are you such a drama queen that you literally have to be the centre of attention all the damn time?


> I've been extremely short tempered in the past week ... *I* felt entitled to an apology ... although *they helped me* through that time ... they were unsympathetic to my pain and efforts

WTF?  
You have been a bit of a shit and they have helped you through it. It’s clear they have *very much* been sympathetic to your pain, because they put up with it and *helped you out*, instead of getting pissed with you.

Nothing here suggests you are owed an apology. Quite the opposite in fact - you owe them a huge thank you from the sounds of it.

In fact one could argue that *you* are the one being unsympathetic to *their* efforts.

> I then go to explain why their jokes hurt

Honestly, it’d be helpful if you could explain that to the rest of us too. 

If they said what they said in a jokey tone (perhaps thus hinting that it hasn’t been so easy for them either), then that’s a good prompt for *you* to apologise for the way *you’ve* been acting recently, thank them for being sympathetic, and then all move on. 

Seriously, they know what you’ve been going through so they aren’t pissed with you over it. But you still did it. 

I mean, they might be pissed at you *now*, seeing how ungrateful and bratty you’re being, but you can probably still save it.

If you can’t recognise that, then you shouldn’t expect people to be supportive of you in similar situations in future."
d9y04z,"YTA. I'd be more concerned about the drug charge depending on the drug and how recent it was. You said it yourself, 'everyone deserves a second chance.' Ben sounds like a great guy to do it.

The guys past shouldn't add any additional stress to that load unless Ben is some kind of illogical worrywart"

d9zl2v,"Yes, YTA. Your wife was clearly not comfortable wearing the lingerie. Your purchase of a gift does not place the receiver under obligation to use said gift for your sexual satisfaction. Your wife gave it to a friend, which is basically like taking it to Goodwill. I'll agree that used lingerie has a stigma associated with it, but practically, if it's clean, it's not really different than buying any other article of clothing. But the reason YTA is that you took the mortifying step of asking your wife's friend for lingerie she has now worn. Asking for any gift back would be tacky. But asking a lady for her lingerie is predatorial. The assumption will be that you want to smell her bits, there's no two ways around it - regardless of your intention. I can only imagine your wife's embarrassment. You should buy her a gift to make up for it - and not lingerie."
d9zleg,"Slightly different though- OP was reciprocally teasing with a group of peers of the same age, these guys are teasing someone younger than them who will likely not feel that he can tease back."

da0f1s,He wants to play U8 because he likes the team he is on and he didn't really like playin U10 the one game he played- not because they were better than him but because they were bigger than him. He's a small 7 year old to begin with (like 42 lbs at his last check up) and those kids had weight and height on him. U10 is also more aggressive than U8 is and he is aggressive for a 7 year old but not a 9-10 year old
da0iz2,"NAH

Your intentions were good, even if it backfired. MILF is one of those terms that some women would find complimentary, while others find degrading. Now you know.

Even though you are not an A, she thinks so, which is what really matters. It clearly hurt her feelings. (i.e. our validation doesn't fucking matter. Making things good with your wife does.)

---

When was the last time you did something flirty/date-like with her? Not have sex, but show her that you want to spend time with her as the women you love? It's been a while, right?

My advice, apologize. Then later, not tied to the apologize, tell her that you have organized a sitter and you are taking her out. When that night comes, dress nicely and give her flowers."

It seems like you are pretending one thing is the issue 'handicapped woman parking in families with children spot' when you're real issue is 'her having the handicapped sticker at all and you don't think she should' and so you want to get her in trouble for the former because of the latter.

I would personally say that handicapped > families with children and should not need to be reported for using those spots. It seems like you just want to spite her because you don't think she deserves the placard at all. 

You don't know why she has a handicapped placard. Maybe this is something she has to do so some day she can get rid of the placard completely. You really don't know her situation."

And if you don’t, and your friendship ends, then it’s on both of you at that point and not wholly on her. Typically I’m the type of person that expects people that fuck up (like Lisa) to take action, the ball is in her court. But I also know people like her that don’t initiate those types of conversations, and so I, the person that was wronged, have to be the one to reach out. Swallowing your pride and seeking a discussion is hard, but if you want to move past this with her then you need to do it. She’s the asshole for doing what she did, but hear her out and let her apologize before your friendship ends."

da3bhi,"NTA. 

I'd like to talk about this situation since it comes up a lot. *Should you reveal to another person that their partner is cheating on them?* It's a very polarizing question, and an argument of privacy vs transparency. 

I think that everyone has their own stance on this. Neither stance is right or wrong. Some people will think you're an asshole, others will not. 

Because of how polarizing the worldview is on this subject (and how neither answer is morally incorrect), I think that **no one** can be wrong in this situation. So you will never be an asshole for choosing to reveal the info or choosing to leave them to their privacy. Obviously *how* you do it makes all the difference but that's not the question here."
da3d36,"This is such a hard one to answer. On the one hand, your intentions were good. But on the other, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. So I guess it honestly all depends on what comes of it in the end. Does the end justify the means? It might. If so, then you're good. But if ultimately her life gets way worse, then you kinda suck. It might get ""way worse"" from her POV for a minute but turn out to be a great decision. But maybe not. 

So I guess what I can tell you is, forgive yourself. What's done is done. Worrying about it won't take it back now. Take the time to really pay attention to the outcome and use it as a learning experience for all involved."

So there’s that.  

The concern is that these bags may open before it gets thrown away. Maybe the homeowner tries to sneak one last bag of trash before pickup and squishes the trash down, your poop bag explodes, now there’s dog poop all inside that persons trash can. In addition, sometimes you are throwing poop into the can AFTER trash has been picked up - now that poop is in the can all week.

NTA because I would feel the exact same way if I were in your shoes. Your bf sounds like he's content with living (in part) on the back of your hard work and has no motivation to contribute more. He already established that he wants kids of his own AND to be a stay-at-home dad. 


Personally, I agree with postponing the wedding, but only so you two can discuss your goals and expectations for this marriage. You already have a daughter, so there's a lot more at stake beyond just you in this relationship. There are a ton of red flags here IMHO.

He is monopolizing your time and money and effort when, according to your own words, he's perfectly capable of buying and paying for a car of his own.

If he's socially awkward, even just slightly, it may be very difficult for him to make friends, and even easier for him to simply stop attempts of friendship and socialization. It may not be to your enjoyment to have him around, but there are times in life where you should sacrifice your own pleasure for the benefit of others.

Edit: Also, college is only temporary. Your attitude, behaviors, basically the demeanors with which you treat other people, that's lifelong. What you may do with E might not matter far in the future, but how it can change both of your, for the better, is truly important.

I don't think your wife is wrong to be uncomfortable with it.

Whatever your intentions, use this as an opportunity to connect with your wife first."

You're going to have to learn how to grow out of that. You're still young, so I know you don't want to be ""different,"" but when you try to hide your real self, a couple of things happen: people don't trust you because they can tell you're hiding something, but don't know if you're hiding that you're a mock trial nerd or that you kill rabbits for fun. The second thing that happens is you become jaded and unhappy, and that leads to shit talking, etc. Trust me when I say that you will be SO MUCH BETTER OFF being your authentic, nerdy self than you will be trying to keep that hidden just to keep the Seths of the world happy. 

Seth is an asshole for teasing you, for sure, but you may want to evaluate whether he has a point that you are making unnecessary work just to make yourself look better. Only you know the answer to this. If you're super committed and just have a particular passion for doing the work, don't stop doing it - but be fair in your assessment of his contributions because, while they may not be as big as yours, they may meet the expectations.

Lastly, don't go giving yourself titles that you don't deserve/exist. You are a co-editor, not the main editor. That was kind of a dick move, true or not. ;-)

Asking someone to be part of the wedding can be a honor for some people, but I don't believe anyone is entitled to make demands on someone's appearance unless they are also willing to pay for it.

You aren't there to be a pretty accessory, you are there to participate in a big life event and if your friend is so shallow they'd expect you to do something like dye your hair, they shouldn't be asking you at all."

You rarely hang out with your girlfriend in favour of hanging with some other girl from who you're getting all your emotional needs? We call that sort of behaviour **emotional cheating.**

It may be that you and your girlfriend are just not compatible people on this level, and that's ok, but you have to actually discuss this with each other (frankly and directly since you're both HFA. Absolutely no hinting or guesswork) and see if you can work this out or if you should break up or what. 

Also see if you can get access to a therapist, so you can get some real help and support without an emotional affair. Even if you guys break up, seek proper help anyway as since you have HFA you might not be able to recognise all the social signs of the friend you see when you're depressed getting burnt out from only seeing this lower side of you which is 100% something that can happen)"

Because that's literally what casual means. From what you've said, he's never treated her as anything less than a person. And hey, as long as both are consenting, it is perfectly fine to only sleep with each other for their body. Just saying that not everyone has to have a personal connection to have sex. Sometimes we just like being with another person, doesn't matter who the person is. If we're all consenting, then it's all good."

It’s fine if that’s what you prefer to do, but next time don’t waste your parents’ $$ or take up a vacation spot from a cousin who would actually want to go to the destination and leave your aunt stuck by herself.

Mate, you're not living with your parents and you're not married, you have roommates. They can't dictate their terms for you to follow and for sure they can not tell you what to do with your finances.

There are three people living there, bills need to split three ways, chores need to be split three ways, rent according to how much space everyone is using but at least two ways.

You're not their beta reader or editor, you're just some random anon on the internet reading their stories. Find something nice to say and leave it at that.

I've read many, many fics over the years and seen all kinds of comments and author replies to said comments. This kind of extensive unsolicited critiquing *never* goes over well, precisely *because* it's unasked for and unwanted, aside from, perhaps, pointing out a typo or two."

If he's gone for good, and if you can afford to lose this $40, then let it go and tell him you're taking over the billing. Figure out who you need to call for both and get your name on the account  don't let him leave the states with his name still as the primary  Then talk to the others to make sure they're cool with it. Don't hesitate to knock on their doors when they are home."

dahjm6,"I think NTA, but on the other hand, I think you're demanding way too much of your mom. You're a grown ass adult. You don't need your mom's approval. Your mom is a grown ass adult and she doesn't have to be interested in your fiance if she doesn't want to. The reality is that if you give it time and stop forcing him onto your mother, the fact that he is a good guy who makes you happy will become evident. Most likely, she will eventually weaken in her resolve as time goes on and your relationship with her, and her relationship with your fiance, will rebuild. 

I went through a very similar situation when I started dating my fiance. We are also eight years apart. My mom hated him. He never did anything to her. She just didn't like him for some reason. She would belittle him in front of me and berate me about dating him. When she wasn't belittling him, she would talk to him in clipped tones or make snide comments. However, I never tried to force her to like him. I simply told her I'm the one dating him, not her, and that she could kindly shut the fuck up with her rude comments because they were unnecessary. She was so rude to him one day that he called her a ""sad, miserable bitch"" right to her face and I agreed with him. She was being one. Two and a half years later of being completely happy and never concerning myself with her opinion or forcing her to like him, she calmed down. We've been dating almost five years now and my mom calls him on his birthday, buys him gifts on holidays, texts him to see how things are going, and finally stopped being a sad, miserable bitch because she realized he was a good man who made me happy. 

That long story is basically to say do what makes you happy, but stop forcing your mom to like what makes you happy, too. It just makes it worse and shows her you care waaaaay too much about what she thinks. She'll come around. If she doesn't, then that's on her, and you can continue to live your happy life while she remains miserable and sad."

It took a long time of trying & failing to get her to do things my way of a moderation diet & high intensity exercise before sitting down and figuring out what SHE was willing to do. This lead to the both of us going keto together because she didn’t want to give up cheeses/high fats. We also started taking different forms of lower impact, higher duration aerobic classes together, as well as going on a lot of hikes and doing the stuff she wanted to do. I fucking HATED it for a while but now there’s a good balance and she’s both lost a significant amount of weight  and she’s in a much better head-space now.

Your aunt is right that you don't have to go and read her stories. She did enough by warning you that she wrote some stories about her experience.
