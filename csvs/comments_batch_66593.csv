d9x47o,"NAH, someone has a job that needs to be done. They offer it to you, you decline because you're not interested.  This is how things work, not sure how anyone in this story is the asshole, besides maybe the original sitter.

Probably we need more info here. Why can't the parents look after their oen kids on Friday night and until they find a new sitter?"
d9xgfv,"ESH

It would be very interesting to hear what happened from your dads wife's point of view.  I have the feeling you are leaving a bit out of the story.

Have you communicated anything with your dads wife? Did you ask her to make your dress and did you offer to pay for her work? 

How would you feel if somebody asks for your skills and then said, ah, I don't want them after all but you could make this small thing for me instead? Again, did you offer to pay her for the cloak?

Your wedding is in January and you're thinking about your dress now but asked your dads wife half a year ago to make your dress. And then you didn't care to talk to her about it since?

It's your wedding, you can wear whatever you want, but don't expect others to cater to your whim, especially if you don't communicate well."
d9xgin,"Nta, you have no obligation to maintain a friendship if you don't like them"
d9xr7d,"YTA, this was a man that obviously was more interested in your life then you were in his, as he gave you a present every year even though you didn't see him often. If you can fly out for your friends you can definitely do it out of respect for someone who was there all of your life. Your mom also notices this and I don't blame her."
d9xspp,">She says she was trying to protect me by not telling me she slept with him, even though I had asked her a few times before.

d9xw3t,"YTA. And pretty bigly.

Your words:

> I was smiling for the first time in ages 

Your partner’s words:

> You're finally smiling. It's good to see you in a good mood for a change

So somebody who cares about you, who has seen you unhappy and in pain for some time, comments that it’s *nice* to see you happy, and this upsets you? WHY? Are you such a drama queen that you literally have to be the centre of attention all the damn time?


> I've been extremely short tempered in the past week ... *I* felt entitled to an apology ... although *they helped me* through that time ... they were unsympathetic to my pain and efforts

WTF?  
You have been a bit of a shit and they have helped you through it. It’s clear they have *very much* been sympathetic to your pain, because they put up with it and *helped you out*, instead of getting pissed with you.

Nothing here suggests you are owed an apology. Quite the opposite in fact - you owe them a huge thank you from the sounds of it.

In fact one could argue that *you* are the one being unsympathetic to *their* efforts.

> I then go to explain why their jokes hurt

Honestly, it’d be helpful if you could explain that to the rest of us too. 

If they said what they said in a jokey tone (perhaps thus hinting that it hasn’t been so easy for them either), then that’s a good prompt for *you* to apologise for the way *you’ve* been acting recently, thank them for being sympathetic, and then all move on. 

Seriously, they know what you’ve been going through so they aren’t pissed with you over it. But you still did it. 

I mean, they might be pissed at you *now*, seeing how ungrateful and bratty you’re being, but you can probably still save it.

If you can’t recognise that, then you shouldn’t expect people to be supportive of you in similar situations in future."
d9y04z,"YTA. I'd be more concerned about the drug charge depending on the drug and how recent it was. You said it yourself, 'everyone deserves a second chance.' Ben sounds like a great guy to do it.

The guys past shouldn't add any additional stress to that load unless Ben is some kind of illogical worrywart"

d9zl2v,"Yes, YTA. Your wife was clearly not comfortable wearing the lingerie. Your purchase of a gift does not place the receiver under obligation to use said gift for your sexual satisfaction. Your wife gave it to a friend, which is basically like taking it to Goodwill. I'll agree that used lingerie has a stigma associated with it, but practically, if it's clean, it's not really different than buying any other article of clothing. But the reason YTA is that you took the mortifying step of asking your wife's friend for lingerie she has now worn. Asking for any gift back would be tacky. But asking a lady for her lingerie is predatorial. The assumption will be that you want to smell her bits, there's no two ways around it - regardless of your intention. I can only imagine your wife's embarrassment. You should buy her a gift to make up for it - and not lingerie."
d9zleg,"Slightly different though- OP was reciprocally teasing with a group of peers of the same age, these guys are teasing someone younger than them who will likely not feel that he can tease back."

da0f1s,He wants to play U8 because he likes the team he is on and he didn't really like playin U10 the one game he played- not because they were better than him but because they were bigger than him. He's a small 7 year old to begin with (like 42 lbs at his last check up) and those kids had weight and height on him. U10 is also more aggressive than U8 is and he is aggressive for a 7 year old but not a 9-10 year old
da0iz2,"NAH

Your intentions were good, even if it backfired. MILF is one of those terms that some women would find complimentary, while others find degrading. Now you know.

Even though you are not an A, she thinks so, which is what really matters. It clearly hurt her feelings. (i.e. our validation doesn't fucking matter. Making things good with your wife does.)

---

When was the last time you did something flirty/date-like with her? Not have sex, but show her that you want to spend time with her as the women you love? It's been a while, right?

My advice, apologize. Then later, not tied to the apologize, tell her that you have organized a sitter and you are taking her out. When that night comes, dress nicely and give her flowers."

It seems like you are pretending one thing is the issue 'handicapped woman parking in families with children spot' when you're real issue is 'her having the handicapped sticker at all and you don't think she should' and so you want to get her in trouble for the former because of the latter.

I would personally say that handicapped > families with children and should not need to be reported for using those spots. It seems like you just want to spite her because you don't think she deserves the placard at all. 

You don't know why she has a handicapped placard. Maybe this is something she has to do so some day she can get rid of the placard completely. You really don't know her situation."

And if you don’t, and your friendship ends, then it’s on both of you at that point and not wholly on her. Typically I’m the type of person that expects people that fuck up (like Lisa) to take action, the ball is in her court. But I also know people like her that don’t initiate those types of conversations, and so I, the person that was wronged, have to be the one to reach out. Swallowing your pride and seeking a discussion is hard, but if you want to move past this with her then you need to do it. She’s the asshole for doing what she did, but hear her out and let her apologize before your friendship ends."

da3bhi,"NTA. 

I'd like to talk about this situation since it comes up a lot. *Should you reveal to another person that their partner is cheating on them?* It's a very polarizing question, and an argument of privacy vs transparency. 

I think that everyone has their own stance on this. Neither stance is right or wrong. Some people will think you're an asshole, others will not. 

Because of how polarizing the worldview is on this subject (and how neither answer is morally incorrect), I think that **no one** can be wrong in this situation. So you will never be an asshole for choosing to reveal the info or choosing to leave them to their privacy. Obviously *how* you do it makes all the difference but that's not the question here."
da3d36,"This is such a hard one to answer. On the one hand, your intentions were good. But on the other, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. So I guess it honestly all depends on what comes of it in the end. Does the end justify the means? It might. If so, then you're good. But if ultimately her life gets way worse, then you kinda suck. It might get ""way worse"" from her POV for a minute but turn out to be a great decision. But maybe not. 

So I guess what I can tell you is, forgive yourself. What's done is done. Worrying about it won't take it back now. Take the time to really pay attention to the outcome and use it as a learning experience for all involved."

So there’s that.  

The concern is that these bags may open before it gets thrown away. Maybe the homeowner tries to sneak one last bag of trash before pickup and squishes the trash down, your poop bag explodes, now there’s dog poop all inside that persons trash can. In addition, sometimes you are throwing poop into the can AFTER trash has been picked up - now that poop is in the can all week.

NTA because I would feel the exact same way if I were in your shoes. Your bf sounds like he's content with living (in part) on the back of your hard work and has no motivation to contribute more. He already established that he wants kids of his own AND to be a stay-at-home dad. 


Personally, I agree with postponing the wedding, but only so you two can discuss your goals and expectations for this marriage. You already have a daughter, so there's a lot more at stake beyond just you in this relationship. There are a ton of red flags here IMHO.

He is monopolizing your time and money and effort when, according to your own words, he's perfectly capable of buying and paying for a car of his own.

If he's socially awkward, even just slightly, it may be very difficult for him to make friends, and even easier for him to simply stop attempts of friendship and socialization. It may not be to your enjoyment to have him around, but there are times in life where you should sacrifice your own pleasure for the benefit of others.

Edit: Also, college is only temporary. Your attitude, behaviors, basically the demeanors with which you treat other people, that's lifelong. What you may do with E might not matter far in the future, but how it can change both of your, for the better, is truly important.

I don't think your wife is wrong to be uncomfortable with it.

Whatever your intentions, use this as an opportunity to connect with your wife first."

You're going to have to learn how to grow out of that. You're still young, so I know you don't want to be ""different,"" but when you try to hide your real self, a couple of things happen: people don't trust you because they can tell you're hiding something, but don't know if you're hiding that you're a mock trial nerd or that you kill rabbits for fun. The second thing that happens is you become jaded and unhappy, and that leads to shit talking, etc. Trust me when I say that you will be SO MUCH BETTER OFF being your authentic, nerdy self than you will be trying to keep that hidden just to keep the Seths of the world happy. 

Seth is an asshole for teasing you, for sure, but you may want to evaluate whether he has a point that you are making unnecessary work just to make yourself look better. Only you know the answer to this. If you're super committed and just have a particular passion for doing the work, don't stop doing it - but be fair in your assessment of his contributions because, while they may not be as big as yours, they may meet the expectations.

Lastly, don't go giving yourself titles that you don't deserve/exist. You are a co-editor, not the main editor. That was kind of a dick move, true or not. ;-)

Asking someone to be part of the wedding can be a honor for some people, but I don't believe anyone is entitled to make demands on someone's appearance unless they are also willing to pay for it.

You aren't there to be a pretty accessory, you are there to participate in a big life event and if your friend is so shallow they'd expect you to do something like dye your hair, they shouldn't be asking you at all."

You rarely hang out with your girlfriend in favour of hanging with some other girl from who you're getting all your emotional needs? We call that sort of behaviour **emotional cheating.**

It may be that you and your girlfriend are just not compatible people on this level, and that's ok, but you have to actually discuss this with each other (frankly and directly since you're both HFA. Absolutely no hinting or guesswork) and see if you can work this out or if you should break up or what. 

Also see if you can get access to a therapist, so you can get some real help and support without an emotional affair. Even if you guys break up, seek proper help anyway as since you have HFA you might not be able to recognise all the social signs of the friend you see when you're depressed getting burnt out from only seeing this lower side of you which is 100% something that can happen)"

Because that's literally what casual means. From what you've said, he's never treated her as anything less than a person. And hey, as long as both are consenting, it is perfectly fine to only sleep with each other for their body. Just saying that not everyone has to have a personal connection to have sex. Sometimes we just like being with another person, doesn't matter who the person is. If we're all consenting, then it's all good."

It’s fine if that’s what you prefer to do, but next time don’t waste your parents’ $$ or take up a vacation spot from a cousin who would actually want to go to the destination and leave your aunt stuck by herself.

Mate, you're not living with your parents and you're not married, you have roommates. They can't dictate their terms for you to follow and for sure they can not tell you what to do with your finances.

There are three people living there, bills need to split three ways, chores need to be split three ways, rent according to how much space everyone is using but at least two ways.

You're not their beta reader or editor, you're just some random anon on the internet reading their stories. Find something nice to say and leave it at that.

I've read many, many fics over the years and seen all kinds of comments and author replies to said comments. This kind of extensive unsolicited critiquing *never* goes over well, precisely *because* it's unasked for and unwanted, aside from, perhaps, pointing out a typo or two."

If he's gone for good, and if you can afford to lose this $40, then let it go and tell him you're taking over the billing. Figure out who you need to call for both and get your name on the account  don't let him leave the states with his name still as the primary  Then talk to the others to make sure they're cool with it.

dahjm6,"I think NTA, but on the other hand, I think you're demanding way too much of your mom. You're a grown ass adult. You don't need your mom's approval. Your mom is a grown ass adult and she doesn't have to be interested in your fiance if she doesn't want to. The reality is that if you give it time and stop forcing him onto your mother, the fact that he is a good guy who makes you happy will become evident. Most likely, she will eventually weaken in her resolve as time goes on and your relationship with her, and her relationship with your fiance, will rebuild. 

I went through a very similar situation when I started dating my fiance. We are also eight years apart. My mom hated him. He never did anything to her. She just didn't like him for some reason. She would belittle him in front of me and berate me about dating him. When she wasn't belittling him, she would talk to him in clipped tones or make snide comments. However, I never tried to force her to like him. I simply told her I'm the one dating him, not her, and that she could kindly shut the fuck up with her rude comments because they were unnecessary. She was so rude to him one day that he called her a ""sad, miserable bitch"" right to her face and I agreed with him. She was being one. Two and a half years later of being completely happy and never concerning myself with her opinion or forcing her to like him, she calmed down. We've been dating almost five years now and my mom calls him on his birthday, buys him gifts on holidays, texts him to see how things are going, and finally stopped being a sad, miserable bitch because she realized he was a good man who made me happy. 

That long story is basically to say do what makes you happy, but stop forcing your mom to like what makes you happy, too. It just makes it worse and shows her you care waaaaay too much about what she thinks. She'll come around. If she doesn't, then that's on her, and you can continue to live your happy life while she remains miserable and sad."

We also started taking different forms of lower impact, higher duration aerobic classes together, as well as going on a lot of hikes and doing the stuff she wanted to do. I fucking HATED it for a while but now there’s a good balance and she’s both lost a significant amount of weight  and she’s in a much better head-space now.

It’s a traumatic time for her too, and to think you didn’t believe your grandma was in a better place may have brushed her the wrong way, because that’s what brings her comfort in her death. I mean, that’s her mom. So I’d say try to be understanding, but no matter what you believe, as long as you loved your grandma and keep her in your heart, I think the rest is irrelevant. I’m sorry for your loss. It’s rough stuff."
daoyos,NAH. People are just grieving and might not realise the effect it will have on the environment. Tell people gently and with an explanation and you won't be TA.
dap55p,NTA that's funny. You should take it a step further and just tell it through the wall.
dap5vv,"NTA. You are compassionate and gave a struggling human a break when they weren’t doing anything to harm anyone. You weighed potential consequences, and treated the situation rationally and responsibly. 

Karen can speak to another manager if she wants to cause needless issues for the homeless."
dap6ix,"Dude, YTA. Maybe she doesn't know how the ed system works, but you, a ""pacifist"" threw a plate at a wall in a moment of anger. You were aggressive and escalated an already shot situation. Yeah, your mom was out of line, but at least she didn't get physically aggressive. You fucked up and became the asshole the second you did that. Before, I'd have said ESH, but you were ABSOLUTELY in the wrong. You may have been justifiably upset, but you used physical force to express your hurt. I seriously suggest anger management or other counseling so you can curb that behavior while you're still young."
dapawk,"A very gentle YTA.
I know you hurt for your more shy child, but they are individuals, not a unit. They will have different friends, interests, lifes. This is healthy and good.

You won't teach them to stick up for each other this way, you'll build resentment at best, and foster a co-dependent relationship at worst.

I know it's hard for both of you, but A needs to start making his own friends. Some will be the same as his brother's, and some will be different."
daph14,YTA it's your dad's place to tell her that and only his.
dapkyi,"NTA but you’re definitely a push over. Dude move out. She’ll keep using you until you can’t make rent. The whole “just walk away” shit would have sent me over the edge. Give her a reasonable time frame to come up with the money you’re owed. If she won’t, then cut ties. You don’t need leeches in your life."
dapmt7,"NTA. That's a place you've been, and there's nothing wrong with keeping mementos of it. It's not like you're pressing your face to perfumed love letters, or something. 

I'm most of the way to 40. I've had a lot of relationships, a lot of partners come and go--ones who left for better jobs or more interesting cities, ones where the breakup was amicable, ones where the breakup was hard. Some of them are dead now. Some of them have married, had children, are living incredible lives. And I'm very happy with my fiance, probably the happiest I have ever been since the day I was born, but still I have photographs, still I have a piece or two of jewelry, a skirt my boyfriend bought me in 2005, a book from 1999. I don't miss those relationships or the people who have left. The ones who are still friends, I'm happy for how things are now. But by god, I am so happy to have the little physical objects that remind me of when I was a younger Koom going through this or that, learning this or that, living in that crappy apartment or the attic room in the student district. 

I wouldn't go back. But forgetting it all would seem like a crime. All that stuff made me into the person who is capable of being an excellent partner to the best man I've ever known.

And the skirt is still cute as hell on me."
dapnly,ESH. He should have apologised/attempted to rectify the situation but you had a million options for dealing with this and you chose to damage someone's property instead of using your big-person words. Smh over here.

I don’t think you need to turn this into a gender thing, obviously the two of you were in a compromised position and it’s weird for two people to be in the bathroom at once. You *both* got written up so she didn’t go after your sexuality or your gender, just felt like it was unprofessional and she’s your boss."
daq1ik,"Are you a minor?  If so you would not be able to legally pursue this, as a minor possessions are theirs.  Right down to your bank accounts.

daqe00,ESH. Sounds like your wife has a drinking problem but wtf man leaving her drunk downtown?
daqk0x,"ESH

You’re using the ‘I gave you money so you have to help me’ mentality which is wrong. You should never offer someone help expecting to get something in return. You should also never lend money you can’t afford to part with, as there’s always the chance a loan will never be repaid even by family. 

It’s not going to kill her to help you out if you asked for help. Cant you just put it together yourself? I’ve built bookcases and tv stands by myself. They aren’t too difficult for one person to do."

Now, getting to the heart of the matter. Do you think he's sloppy or that it was an intentional thing, like he gets off on shit smearing in a woman's bathroom?"
daqufo,YTA. No company would pay out for a hotel when it is a simple day trip. They're already paying your airfare. There is no reason to pay for a hotel because you want to take a bath. I don;t understand why you can't take a bath before your flight?
daqw7g,"Yeah she's probably not allowed there as a guest for longer than 2 weeks anyway. I'd just ask them how long she'll be staying. If she intends another month, I'd talk rent. NTA"

dar3ck,"NTA.

Let me repeat that for you. Not. The. Fucking. Asshole.

My man, you're talking about your kid. You have every right to say fuck off to your sister.

darrw1,"NTA. While certain accommodations should be made for people with disabilities such as autism, it shouldn't be at the expense of other people's livelyhood.

das74q,"You're comment isn't wrong, but OP's mom is definitely the asshole."
dasa5w,"YTA, a middle school asshole who said a middle school asshole thing while attempting to console your friend. But as long as you apologized to your other friend for hurting him and have tried to change your behavior (not making those kinds of jokes), then you’ve already taken the right actions to resolve the situation. Now it’s time to move on.

Will you still think about it ten years from now at 3am when every embarrassing memory comes flooding back to keep you up at night? Probably. It’s all a part of growing up. Just try to be a better person."
dasa6m,"NAH 

She’s obviously all over the place mate, it’s not a healthy relationship to Pursue. 

She wants something like you... but not you... I hate to say it as a fellow bro, but she wants you firmly entrenched in the friend zone... she wants your love, affection and attention but not anything physical. 

I doubt it’s intentional to hurt you, but stepping away from it is a good idea."
dasa7b,"YTA, you should have told her before now. Is it too late for her to ask a friend? You should at least offer to pay her for the ticket since you've led her on."
dasafk,"NAH 

I won’t go as far as to call you an asshole but... why does it matter that she talks to you about *your* life constantly? 

She’s pregnant, she’s got more important things to plan and worry about than her friend’s new job. 

Give her a break."
dasf0j,ESH for jumping straight to a physical confrontation. You went 0-100 without anything in between. You didn’t even give him the option to get off and wait for his other friends.
dasgri,NTA. These replies are really weird. You’re saying your boyfriend was Snapchatting back and forth with Ally constantly *after* you got together. It made you nervous so you asked him what his deal was with her. He lied and said they we’re just work friends. 2 years later it comes out that they had a sexual relationship. And you’re the controlling or nosy one?
dash5g,"NTA. Putting the animal down if it is in distress, pain and lacking a quality of life despite all your best efforts and years of love is, in fact, the least asshole thing to do. Sounds like someone doesn't want to make a tough and uncomfortable decision, but this is what life it about."
daspbt,NTA - Those things belonged to you; they were not his to give away
dasvav,NTA. The aunt who gifted it without your permission is the asshole.
dasznq,"NAH - Does it really matter who's the asshole? You're a couple, a team. It's not you vs. her - it's the two of you vs. the problem. 

If you both blame each other, there's no fixing the problem."
daszyt,"NAH: It’s your home and you deserve to be comfortable but your mother shouldn’t have to be uncomfortable by wearing shoes or socks she dislikes or having cold feet. Maybe you can take her on a shopping trip and suggest looking at slippers, if she tries them on in store you can check if they’re quiet."
dat4p1,"NAH but I think it depends on what your boss says about it. I work at a hotel and my boss lets me read, watch netflix, or work on my school work during the slow time as long as I make sure to stop when people are in the lobby. But that's with his permission. If your boss doesn't want you to do that then you shouldn't be doing it, if they say it's okay then it's okay."

datiy5,NTA. The dude had absolutely no right to use his body as a weapon to push you out of the seat.
datl57,"I'm jewish and your friend is an idiot. She also doesn't know what cultural appropriation really is or means.

NTA

Converting to Judiasm is a long, drawn-out, complicated process. You need to really be committed to it, and that's good cause you don't want to do it halfway. The process is meant to weed out those that think it may be 'kinda cool' to those who really are interested and committed to it.

So my first tip for you is to find that local temple like you talked about, go to a service, and try to talk to the rabbi there. You should tell him/her that you are not jewish but had a great experience at a temple in your hometown and want to get involved and learn more.

There will be lots of volunteering opportunities as well as times to go to a Fri night or Sat sabbath service as well as events and holidays that take place during the week.

Get involved but start slow. Conversion takes a long time. You are at the stage where you are interested and you want to/need to learn more before you decide. Most rabbis are great at this but if you do not find one receptive this way then PM me as I have a friend from college who is a rabbi and excels at community outreach."
datoqu,Because your mother sounds fucking nuts.
datpe2,NTA. Your dad needs to learn to use his words.
datrrz,"YTA 

If you don't know why you need more help than we can provide."

dau845,"YTA

I'm sorry but when a grownup wants to have a party in his own house he doesn't need to ask his kids for permission. I thought maybe you had to do all the work, buy the groceries or that you're being your dad's caretaker, but since that's not the case yeah YTA

Edit: also, he did tell you about the plans 2 days earlier, you didn't arrive to a house full of people that came out of nowhere"
dau8a9,"NTA, that's hideous and the fact that the dogs weren't sick or dying suggests that she had them put down because they had started to be a bit slower and less fun. Your mother is awful."
daubq3,"Bro, she is really close with the girl, there is no way in a million years you can avoid her finding out. Just tell her, it's better coming from you. 

Of course YWBTA, if anything you would be if you didn't tell her."
daulnx,"I'm torn between YTA/NAH. It seems like the students don't think they'll get good recommendations from the other teachers, and I think as a teacher it's still an expectation that you'd write a recommendation if asked. You don't need to deeply know them; doubtful any of their profs other than the ones in their eventual major will, and none of them are going to see your letters, so all you'd really be doing is giving the students peace of mind that they'll get a good rec. 

That being said, you don't have to write them (I think) and I think you can even say ""first come, first serve"" if you feel you're going to end up with too many to write."
dauq3k,"NTA, that's fucking creepy. Like you're doing your own thing, I wouldn't really expect much conversation when doing something other than gardening"
dauvqm,"YTA. Yes, she seems to be asking everyone to bring all the food and drinks, but that's not uncommon- ever heard of a potluck? And she's making an effort to not just seem cheap by making it part of the party with the Halloween themed cook off. It's okay that doesn't feel fun for you, but you don't have to tell her nobody will have fun. Thats your assumption. Actually, to me, a person who loves Halloween, that party sounds awesome imo. I know for some people, a potluck is not their thing, and costumes are not their thing, but she's clearly excited to have people over, so why not let her have that excitement?"
dauzv1,"NTA. You didn’t ask to involve yourself in this, T involved you.  The friendship is dead. He’s been plotting this for a while and manufacturing crisis in order to achieve this outcome."
dav26l,"YTA

I didn't realise being gay was funny. Or the abuse some suffer because of it."
dav3tp,"YTA - not for staying with Tom, but for not rescinding your RSVP once you decided not to go and for avoiding her calls.  If you didn't want to go, just change your FB response and send her a quick text / call saying something's come up and you won't be making it."
dav7xt,YTA for letting him have such free reign. Pull it in a bit and parent.
dav89a,NTA. Your ex's gf's wants do not supersede a binding agreement that multiple family's schedules have been built around. They can suck it up and pay a little more for vacations for a few years. Also your ex is a double asshole for holding something your daughter wants hostage to try to pressure you into giving in.
dav9ad,"NTA. In the US it’s not expected to tip at fast food places, or in a drive thru


I’m shocked that they called you out on not tipping. They could definitely get written up for doing that"
dava5q,"I adopted and raised 6 troubled kids so I understand your frustration. You are NTA... BUT... there are 3 things you should never, ever manipulate/take away in furtherance of discipline and those are food, shelter, and love. You need to understand that this child is acting out because he has no boundaries; Kids need to know exactly where those boundaries are and that he is always safe within those boundaries. When I had this problem with my youngest son I assigned him cooking duty 2 nights a week. I was there for questions or help, or support but I made sure he did the work, all the way from shopping for the ingredients to cooking, serving, and cleaning up. And I praised his efforts the entire time. Then, the next time he complained about my cooking in a mean way or was dismissive I asked him if it would have hurt his feelings if I had made fun of his meatloaf and potatoes. 

He was never unkind or difficult about anyone else’s cooking again. And today he is a professional baker. 

You have to give kids choices... a choice to behave and get rewards or a choice to misbehave and suffer consequences. Set you boundaries/expectations and make sure he knows the benefits and the costs and then do everything you can in order to help him succeed."
davoqp,"NTA in my opinion. I wouldn't have tipped him if he only cared for his other costumers. The way you described it makes it sound like a bad service to me.

Well, but if you think it wasn't bad then why post this on here?

It's very simple, you tip, so everything was okay
You don't tip, so it's wasn't.

Imo this was bad service and the waiter didn't really deserve a tip for that"
davpd9,"YTA. When someone gives you a gift you don't like, you smile and thank them for it. You don't have to lie, you just don't have to tell them you don't like it, because it's *not about the thing,* it's about the though. I wish I had a grandpa to bring me clothes from France. It was really nice that he thought of you while he was there, even if he doesn't understand your personal style."
davr24,"NAH. Replace the panel on your own dime, then never watch her kids again. She gets to have that attitude and you get to not do her any favors anymore."
davw5e,"YTA. It's not your business to put that anxiety in Dan's head - especially since you weren't privy to conversations he might have already had with his wife to plan for this child. Dan giving up music will make him unhappy, which will then make the family unhappy. Wouldn't it be better in the long run if, instead of changing careers, he attempted to make the one he currently has, the one that makes him happy, make him more money? Don't be a busybody. You're not an asshole for being concerned, you're an asshole for being a busybody and assuming these people aren't responsible."
daw13i,NTA she sounds spoiled and entitled.
daw882,"ESH

Your brother sucks for not being willing to help you out, but you also suck for assuming and not asking ahead of time."
dawd88,"NTA.  Sorry, your sister sounds cheap for getting so little food and wanting to keep all the play tickets.  You shouldn’t of had to wait so long when you got there too, very disrespectful.  Not a party I would have wanted to take my family to."
dawfu2,"You were not the asshole until you put the knife through his heart by claiming it would never happened if you waited for him.

As it is, ESH.

If he is such a flake, why did you consider splitting it with him in the first place?"
dawhx2,NAH. The cat couldn’t stay with you and you found him another good home. Your friend has a right to be a little upset though. You could have at least written him a letter to tell him what was going on so he didn’t have to find out when he got out.
dawksz,"NTA. I personally feel like if you are a guest in someone's house and they warn you of something then you should probably listen to their advice. Also side note: cats aren't exactly known to listen. It makes more sense of her to be more aware of her possessions while staying at your house instead of trying to convince a cat not to do cat things. Cats are butts. Loveable butts, but butts nonetheless."
dawo4a,"YTA. This is what you sign up for with housemates. He didn't build the house. He isnt stomping about late at night. You cant make him stop, nor should he have to. I get its irritating but you're just going to have to find a way to deal with it. Leave him alone"
dawru5,YTA. you said you get lunch tips if you come in before 2pm. You came in at 2:30 pm so why would you get lunch and dinner? You were already compensated properly.
daww1p,"I don’t think anyone here is the asshole but to be frank, why are you paying for her at all?"
dax644,"NAH but I'd want to be told, and I wouldn't want to hear it from a future lover. Better coming from a sister. Probably not both of you. A little dash of scented powder each morning would probably do the trick."
daxa38,"NTA. 

Two things;

23 isn't too far away from 20. Holy shit. I feel like your parents just used that excuse as a way to control you. It's manipulative and gross to give your grown daughter ultimatums over who she dates.

You have every right to be angry. You have every right to decide who your child sees and who it doesn't. If I were you, I'd tell your brother that this is YOUR kid, and your decisions are to be respected and not discussed any further unless he wants to damage the relationship you guys have maintained.

edit: for those quoting me on ""you have every right to decide who your child sees and who it doesn't"" & how that's the same mindset that her parents originally had 


Y'all know damn well that there's a big ass difference between making decisions for a young child and for an older teen/adult."
daxbai,"ESH She cheated while sober, the drinking isn't the issue here. She's an ass for obvious reasons. You told her you don't respect her, and dont trust her.

You're not doing anyone any favours in this situation."
daxhjd,"I lived in a small town in Indiana, no traffic lights and no restaurants. Nearest decent college was 3 hours. I moved away and have never regretted it.

If it had been due to something like an eating disorder that would have reinforced the unhealthy behaviour and could have had negative consequences.

I know what it feels like because I've been bullied for my looks a lot but I still had friends and wasn't as anxious. You're young and still able to recognise the need for therapy, I wasn't even aware of anxiety until I was like 20. You could explore the internet for some help if getting actual therapy isn't an option right now, or talk to your parents about it on a more serious note than just casually mentioning it. Also, report bullying. Never let them get away with it. Be the snitch, and don't be afraid to defend yourself. Sooner or later, you might be in a situation where you're forced to."

There will be times when her uncle has to shout ""DON'T GO NEAR THE ROAD!"" or her male cousins have to tell her to ""PUT DOWN THAT SNAKE!"" and she needs to learn that that's not abusive.

Only you know whether you sounded angrier than you should have, but speaking to really small children in a firm, authoritative voice when they do something wrong is actually the most reasonable option open to you."

db1gpo,"NAH

what was the point of texting her and why didn't you mention it to your SO? 


You aren't TA for what you said, that sounded very respectful to your relationship, but if I was your gf I wouldn't want to find out that info the same time as your buddies.

Edit: changed from i-n-f-o to NAH

Although OP didn't respond to the questions above, unless the answers were crazy off I don't think he's TA. However, I don't think the gf is either, she's upset that she wasn't told before and found out a week later in front of his friends and I get that. 

A couple users have pointed out that the friends are TA for bringing it up in front of his gf and I agree. Not only that, they are friends with the girl as well and knew she had a crush, why didn't they tell her he was taken? 

I'm sure that the couple in this post has mended things by now, he probably apologized with saying he didn't think it was a big deal and his text was respectful (it was) and she probably apologized of accusing him of stuff because she felt blindsided by this information. As always, communication could avoid a lot of conflict in this sub. 

One last note: 2 people stated that he didn't want to ""ghost"" the girl... That is not what ghosting means, ghosting is when you already have some type of relationship with the other person and are in contact and then one person just disappears with no explanation. He didn't even have the girls number prior to this so in no way would him not texting her be ghosting her."
db1gxd,"NTA  


Although I would say giving the new people a chance is probably the right thing to do, this isn't like a job, this is something you are doing because you enjoy it, and you should have equal stake in what goes on with the group.

And people need to train their dogs not to bark, not bitch about people going past.  Also, you can set those doorbell cameras not to pick up people on the road.  All your neighbors sound like self centered assholes.  

I would say just to ignore that nextdoor app.  We got on it for a minute but stopped.  It was all just the group of neighbors who have nothing better to do than bitch about and police everything everyone does.   If life was dictated by that app, then no one in my neighborhood could mow the lawn,  walk down the street, let their kids play outside, have visitors, work on their house... etc.

I can't say for sure if you have an ED, because I don't know your eating habits. But losing that much weight isn't a good sign. You said yourself you are stressed. Your parents just want to keep you healthy. If you want to keep staying with your grandparents, maybe you can make an agreement with your parents and your grandparents that you'll meet with an ED dietitian or therapist just to talk, or that your grandparents will hold you accountable to eating.

A lot of family and friends do this and it is 100 percent wrong in every situation no matter the profession.

Unless the person offers to do something like take photos, draw, write or wire a house for free, you aren’t entitled to their services because you’re family or you know the person. If you would pay anyone else for this service why would you not pay a family member? 

You are being taken advantage of and I would put a stop to it if I were you. Let her be angry if she wants to be, but you’ve already done a lot of work for her for free. If you don’t put your foot down she’s just going to keep asking for free shoots."

Either way, you're a hypocrite."
db7qy9,"NTA. You didn't skip it--you were never invited. They didn't want you there to celebrate with them. They wanted you there so that you could do something for them, i.e. bake the cake.

Your daughter is 16, not 6, and at her age she deserves a say on whether she has a relationship with her father. Instead of banning her from visiting him, I'd talk to her about his remarks. Ask how she feels about him being drunk when she arrives, or making comments about her weight. If you give her space to share her feelings without judgment, you may find that she arrives at the same conclusion you did on her own."

Stop using your own preconceptions for discriminating against people.

Bluntly, given your ""gayest voice"" previous comment, this just sounds like a weak attempt at excusing your discrimination. 

> ruin the scene in the process

Unless he's incapable of saying the lines you've penned for the boyfriend character, or generally incapable of acting, he isn't going to ruin the scene. Given you don't say either of those is an issue, yeah, I'm once again going to say you guys are just trying to find a way to discriminate against a guy whose voice you think sounds ""gay.""

Essentially, just in case you didn't get it, YTA.

BTW, since you claim chemistry is an issue:

> My friend already knows the lines, he could play the boyfriend role and we could be done with that.

How do you know your friend and the girl will have the right chemistry? If they don't - as far as other people are concerned, not you guys, since you'll will be biased - will you replace your friend as well? How many guys do you plan on auditioning to find the ""right"" chemistry?

Like I said, it all comes back to discrimination against a guy whose voice you don't like and probably think is either high pitched or feminine."

db9s60,"I am leaning towards YTA but I need more information. You say he owes you 1.2 k but in what currency? I’m in the United States and $1200 is a huge chunk of money. But you might be somewhere else where it’s not that much.

Here’s where I think you’d be the asshole for making him pay. When I stayed with my aunt she offered to turn on the pool heater so I can go swimming. She never mentioned that she was going to charge me for the heating costs, I had she told me I never would’ve asked. I was a guest in her home, she made the offer, and I assume that she did it all the time when she wanted to swim. She ended up charging me $240 for two weeks of staying with her.

Your roommate based his energy usage on the price you gave him. He had no idea that you had made a mistake and it was gonna cost him a huge chunk of money. (still dependent on what currency you’re talking about). How did been getting colder and you got the last months bill and said hey roomie this is way more than I thought it was we’re going to have to adjust our energy consumption. You’re coming to an 11 months later. 

I’d be pissed from the standpoint why didn’t you tell me sooner. I don’t know you and you might be a very responsible person and this was just something you didn’t have experience with or knowledge with. When I first moved into my first place the air-conditioning bill hit me hard. I learned a lesson from it. But no one can adjust their behavior without feedback. 

You let it go on for 11 months, which makes me consider you weren’t staying on top of it.

I’d like to add you are probably in a different country so maybe the energy bills don’t come monthly? I just don’t see how you could’ve missed something for 11 months"

My sister and I started a business.  We haven't had any hurt feelings from our other 2 siblings, really. We're all spread out, so that helps. 

But we too have tried to limit work talk while we're all together.  We try to do it when it's just us.

I can see how Kim feels left out, being 1 of 7.  She does need to understand it's listen to work stuff or don't come to the work stuff events, which will be frequent.

OTOH, so she doesn't work out.  Is there anything she can contribute?  She's a beautician.  Is she artistic?  None of the other professions scream creative to me (note, I am not creative either, artistically).  Her contribution doesn't have to be fitness related.  She could work on branding, marketing, or even create an addition to the business based on her background.  I could see going to my gym, having a sauna afterwards, then getting a haircut, shave, and/or massage if there was a spa attached."
dbchcu,"YTA. As a single person with married siblings, this REALLY bugs me. Why should an individual only be required to contribute 25% just because they happen to be married? What ends up happening is that the single people spend proportionally more on gifts that the married people, which is unfair.

Again, no. A ""huge bombshell"" is ""I spent the time we were apart in federal prison, and any money I make for the rest of my life needs to go straight to that zoo I knocked over when I was smoking meth.""

Edit 2: i know this happens. I’m not naive. Men are gross, and do gross things like masturbate to girls pictures bc those girls would never give them the time of day IRL and that’s the only way they’ll ever have a sexual experience involving said girls.

2. If your wife is a recovering alcoholic and it has not affected her marriage or life in years, then you're super TA here bc that has nothing to do with her mothering skills.

3. Tit for tat is never something you should do.

Simply because doing things behind your SO’s back is an asshole move. He can loathe the idea however much he wants, but come to a compromise.

It’s awkward and I’m sorry you’re in that situation but I think the consequences of them finding out that you do have HSV-1 when you have a cold sore or something (and them subsequently believing that you knowingly exposed them to it, even if you only share when you have no sores) will be a lot worse than just telling them you have herpes and explaining or not sharing drinks as a practice."

I think your parents may be embarrassed, which is why they are reacting poorly. Is it possible they cannot afford to replace it themselves? If I were that parent, I would be deeply ashamed that my young daughter would be paying for basic needs that I should be providing. 

That said, there is not much you can do other than to offer to replace it and, perhaps, make the best of what is already there that you can. Leaking toilets or non-flushing toilets are usually a simple and cheap fix of the parts inside the tank. Check YouTube for many easy explainers on how to fix your toilet so that it at least flushes properly. It’s a good skill to learn anyway. There are other great resources on how to keep such surfaces looking clean, as well, and remove stains from the porcelain. You could replace the seat as well if that’s starting to look old. All that can be done for much cheaper and make it liveable without a huge fight about the expense over a brand new toilet.

dbojc9,"NTA 

You are not his therapist and while he's right that he needs someone to talk to, this is way above your pay grade. It's not alright for him to place that weight on you, even if he's in a bad place. But he might not understand this in his current mental state. Stick with the boundaries you placed, but encourage him to talk to his doctor, family, and seek counseling. He may be able to find a therapist or counselor that takes payment on a sliding scale based on income."
dbokhq,Nta Meet them briefly at any normal gathering then never again so you can say you met them but didn't hit it off.  What are they trying to get you into the will or something?
dbonzb,"I think YTA if you don't tell her. Like tell her you plan on getting a new partner if she's not faster so she should lower the weights so you guys can stay together, no big deal. Otherwise I think I need new partner for my time so I don't get in trouble."
dbopac,ESH first off what guy pees standing up with the seat down? I feel like you guys are small braining big time. Just put the seat up like 99.9% of the world does and problem solved. What is so hard about this.
dbopxi,"NTA.  Good on you to teach your boyfriend manners!  Sure, it might not be enforceable, but it’s still rude."
dbopzx,"NTA. This is literally her job. Office hour amounts are clearly spelled out in almost every adjunct contract. 

I’m usually quite critical of students posting “my prof sucks” or “I’m paying their salary” nonsense. In this case, I fully support you. As a university program head, this is the info I need to do my job well, but I won’t know about it if students don’t reach out.

Edited to add: I saw another comment mention that CC without context might look a little passive aggressive and I agree. If this ever happens again, just email the chair directly."
dborln,"NAH, but I think a better solution would be to go to the club manager or whoever makes these decisions and talk to them about changing the rules, rather than just putting lower-down staff members in awkward positions. Otherwise it's just you on a personal crusade, rather than actually effecting change."
dbot1s,"NTA You aren’t being met with respect that you’ve given the job. Not giving a lunch break is illegal, making someone go that long without a lunch is dangerous and not good. Cutting those breaks as a backfire to leaving is absurd. I don’t know your entire situation, but I will say to think about it burning that bridge may hurt you later on down the road. If you have no intention of returning and not showing up won’t backfire at some point, then don’t go. But do think carefully before making a decision to just not show up. However, you are definitely not an asshole for feeling this way."
dbovke,"NTA for “side effects?” of pregnancy, one I’m assuming you both entered into willingly. You currently have no control over what your mind does while you’re sleeping and it isn’t your fault that you’re waking up screaming. 

I have to say I wonder how well he will cope when it is your infant waking up multiple times a night screaming. Perhaps you could point out this is good practice for him.

ETA: I’ve seen some people say no AH here and that would be true if OPs partner just wanted to sleep. Many parenting and pregnant couples get too little sleep and managing that together is a challenge they have to figure out. But if he’s acting like OP has wronged him in some way then he’s still the AH."
dboz3u,"NTA get a lawyer, that's a toxic living situation."
dbp1oa,"Nooooooo no no no no no. 

Paper is not some kind of magic anti germ barrier, and if you report your experiences to the authorities I'm sure they can help explain this to the restaurant. 

NTA. And thank you for acting appropriately in a situation where it would be difficult to do so (new job)"
dbp9mz,"NTA

It's clear that you have struggles eating and with your weight (not want to assume you have an ED but it seems like it) and if that's the only thing you eat she should be a little bit more respectful and think about you.

38 is concerning low girl, I'm 1,57 and weigh 54 and I've been going through chemo for 4 months now."
dbph9o,"NTA your name, your choice. I wouldn't even bother telling him if I were you. He made his choice and he chose his other family. It doesn't sound like he's really even a part of your life now. You don't owe him a notification."
dbpk2i,"YTA. 

Dogs are for life. 
The poor dog has been thrown out by her first family. 
Then thrown out by your dad
And now thrown out by you? 
Dogs are supposed to have a FOREVER home. 

Tell new girlfriend you'll need to wait for Abbey to pass before you're willing to move in together. 
Let the dog have sleepovers at your dad's house if you want to stay at her house for a night or two.  But don't give up the dog. That's just cruel. 


You getting a GF shouldn't ruin a dogs life. The dog did nothing but love you."
dbpmrp,NTA it seems like the meeting isn't to discuss the problems but to get rid of you as they see you as a problem
dbppt4,NTA. It's been four months of dating and she's asking way too much. She needs to move home if she's not finding work or a way to support herself.
dbprwj,"I dont understand why you want to remove that rule, whats wrong with them writing their pronouns down? Thats a lot easier than them having to take it upon themselves to tell you."
dbpt48,"NTA

While giving a polite ""I'm sorry this happened to you"" would have been fine, it would have been a social nicety and nothing more - certainly not required.

Your friend is an asshole for pointing fingers and then being in a snit because you aren't indulging her fantasy blame game."
dbpwbp,"NTA they're just being sore losers.

But when I play video games with friends and Ive been clearly beating them the whole night I might just let them win 1 or 2 games so everyone's alittle happy."
dbpwju,"NTA in my opinion. All you want for your brother is the best. I really hope your brother breaks it off with his bf, no one deserves that kind of bullcrap."
dbq7oi,"ESH people with kids need to accept the lifestyle they have chosen. This is a situation you put yourself in, then let your boundaries down ruining what should be a special day because you work hard keeping someone else alive the other 364 days."
dbqauu,Definitely NTA. It's your marriage and your wedding. Do what will bring you and your fiancé the most happiness. Parents should be supportive and understanding.
dbqbw5,"NTA

As someone with a six-month old cat (getting desexed tomorrow - hooray!) who has had a few accidents or deliberate sprayings, I do not blame you at all. It's a godawful smell and takes days to dissipate, if you can't figure out exactly where they went.

There are specialist products you can get to deal with the odour of cat urine. But your landlady should be buying those, not you.

It maybe that they can't smell the urine in the same way, either because they have a poor sense of smell or they're simply used to it."
dbqj39,"From the info I have YTA. You two weren’t a couple, and after only two dates with no agreement about being exclusive it’s not fair to expect her not to see anyone else. If she wasn’t planning on ever telling you she wasn’t interested she might also be TA, but from your post it’s not clear to me if that’s the case."
dbr0qw,"Info: have you followed up with your boss about the proposal (after 3 weeks he might've forgotten, or never seen it)? Have you asked the other woman to let you do the work you're required to? Collaboration is key, particularly if the company is growing and needs to meet higher demand - insert yourself into the workload to get recognized as opposed to waiting for orders. Be honest about your dedication to learning skills and doing work for the company, your boss already vouched for you so I don't see why they wouldn't want you involved now"
dbr2qt,"NAH. You need to consider this from her point of view. It would have sounded to her like you deliberately chose to ignore her (reasonable) request that you use her correct gender, which is why she’s angry with you.

It sounds like it was a genuine mistake, so you need to apologise and make an effort to not do it again.

There being a gay guy at the table is absolutely not relevant."
dbrbwi,"NTA. Listen, I know you love your sister, but you cannot sacrifice your life over this. It is not your responsibility. If they aren't willing to pay you, don't do it."
dbrd1j,"NAH (between you and Banana), but tell her the truth.

I met long ago a person like apple and it was unbelievable the things she could make up, I did believe too the first couple of times but the stories every time were more and more ridicolous, I must admit it made for some good amusement after getting used to... whichever crazy thing she would come up with next."
dbrkr1,"YTA. Even if he's being 'unfairly promoted', that's not his fault and you shouldn't pin your frustration on him. He's excited about being promoted, obviously he's going to talk about it often. Telling him off in front of everybody doesn't do anything but make your relationship worse with your sibling."
dbruki,NTA. You paid for those seats. It would be different if you had just occupied them unreserved.  They were yours to do with as you wish.
dbrupz,"YTA- You’re not transphobic for not inviting him, you’re transphobic for no longer being comfortable round someone you considered a friend over this transition."
dbrzgw,"NTA, dog shit is a contaminant, and a lot of people will claim they’ll come back for the bag but don’t. It’s not everyone else’s responsibility to deal with it, and if more people call these types out, less bagged shit will be laying around.

If they don’t want to carry shit for their walk, they shouldn’t have gotten a dog."
dbs0c9,"NAH

What's the worst that could happen? They fire you?"
dbs2nq,"NAH. Let them live their life, both of you will be happier."
dbs8aq,"NTA you were honest. he needs to get his shit together or stop complaining about it.
there is no point to playing nice with someone who doesn't put anything into the friendship other than complaining"
dbscfw,"YTA for self diagnosing. Go see a therapist to sort your shit out, not reddit."
dbseyy,"NTA.  WTF kind of Dance school expects you to get out of school early to attend?  Academics always come first, and any competent athletic instructor should know that."
dbsit8,NTA. Clearly. How could you possibly be the AH here?
dbslmv,"Why can’t you invite spouses and have everyone pay for their own? Personally, I’d rather be able to bring my spouse and pay for my bill."
dbstcg,"NTA - I have things that I intentionally and actively keep hidden from my coworkers. If they went into my car after any given weekend, they might find out a lot more about me than I'd be comfortable with and I would frankly be pissed off at having my privacy invaded like that."
dbswbu,"16, she's had several crushes."
dbsxbi,YTA why are you opening other peoples post and why are you ordering books when you can't read
dbsz9c,"NTA - you can be called whatever you want. Whether it's out of fun or jealousy, you deserve to be addressed how you wish."
dbt1yk,"YTA. You went out of your way to have your wife’s brother arrested, not because it was the right thing to do, but because you don’t like him."
dbt2qp,"NTA—the next time she is on the toilet, shove the phone in her face and tell her that she will be FaceTiming your grandma right at that moment."
dbt4m2,YTA. Never assume the people around you don't speak your language.
dbt65k,"If you are living there, take the animals out for exercise.  Or, offer to purchase a larger set of kennels for them."
dbtchc,NTA. Missing an incredibly important part of her child's life to run her fraudulent scam of a business? That's pretty low.
dbtepb,"Oh yikes. In general, you should never share photo or video of someone that hasn’t given you permission to. I will say it’s also kind of creepy that you searched the internet for her and then decided to share a video of her on your twitter without her knowledge. So, I’m gonna say YTA."
dbth47,"NTA.  You just received the new timetable and you weren’t able to figure out a plan that would work for both of you.  If he wanted you to wait, then he should have provided clear instruction instead of being ambiguous about it and then throwing a fit about it later."
dbtm6r,"NTA.  Shane is overstaying his welcome.  If he wants the same perks as a roommate, he should start paying.  I would have tolerated only the 1 week.  After that, he can’t just come over as though he owns the place.  Does he have a spare key he just keeps?"
dbtpb8,"YTA IF:

1- you book the hotel without warning her,

2- Expect her to pay more than she was planning to,

3- you decide to take the extra charges on yourself and then keep bringing it up later."

dbtu1v,"YWBTA. You just said all the other computers are taken. If you can’t move, neither can he. Put on a headset or get over it."
dbtv8v,"YTA. If you know he didn't get them by accident, why do you keep asking? Nobody gets a scar in the shape of a star by accident, so the obvious assumption is that he didn't ""get them,"" he *did* them."
dbtxaf,"This sucks for everyone involved, but going to say you're NTA here.

Charging her will just increase the animosity and be a burden on both of you (you to track, her to come up with the money).

It's important to stress that it's not just the dishes, but all of the reasons you listed. Sit her down and have a discussion, and have the list handy.  When she has the full inventory of areas she can help she'll hopefully either realize the trouble she's causing and pitch in, or decide she can't live under your rules and move out."
dbtxaz,"NTA

There's no single good reason to mutilate your son without any medical necessity."
dbtygy,YTA. You sound like just another kid who thinks they know everything.
dbu042,"NTA And in some olaces, that kind of porn is illegal."
dbu09d,"NTA, your friend is a natural scammer, he will do well in life"
dbucao,"NTA. Sure, she wanted to spent time with you and so you did, but there’s nothing wrong with arranging to also see someone who’s very important to you. Your girlfriend was selfish and you were right to call her out on it"
dbuckt,"NTA. He's clearly too careless to have one, and apparently isn't attached enough to them to care when something happens.  
  
Edit: I wanna add to this bc it really has my broccoli steamed. I've worked with birds for a while now, both as a pet owner and at several different rescues. Birds are highly social animals who thrive off of their ""flock."" Moving around and being given away is deeply traumatic for them, and often leaves them with behavioral issues. So even if we dismiss the two that flew away and the one he stepped on as freak accidents (rather than negligence, or some other horrifying alternative), he either doesn't know or doesn't care about their psychological well-being. And either situation is very, very bad."
dbueme,NAH. It's your ROOMMATE'S parents not your bf/gf. Get your activities done if that's what you want to do and don't worry too much about not meeting your roommate's parents.
dbugnd,YTA who the heck do you think does “your” chores when you’re not at home for extended amounts of time?
dbulij,NTA: sometimes people react weirdly when they are caught off-guard. Don't overthink it. You did nothing rude.
dbumve,"Well I dunno if you are the asshole.

But you very well may have just inadvertently ended your relationship. 

Your man needed help and wasn't able to count on you. That's going to be hard to recover from."
dbunfu,"NAH.

> I'm talking $600 extra to cater to these three individuals

I just got married, so I absolutely believe this is what your caterer quoted you.  However, you and I both know it is bullshit.

Call a local restaurant, place a to-go order for a couple vegan and Halal meals on the day of the wedding.  Make a groomsman or an usher go pick it up before the reception.  Total should cost you maybe $80.  If the caterer complains about you bringing in outside food, tell them to shove it up their asshole. They would have acquired the business if they accommodated you appropriately."
dbuodt,"NTA, she sounds horrible. Do what you need to do."
dbuua5,YTA what do you gain by telling her that you are no longer friends? You don’t have to make an effort to reach out if she doesn’t seem receptive. You also don’t have to go out of your way to tell her the friendship is over though. Just keep interacting with each of them as much or little as you want
dbuw2u,"NTA. You do need to sit down and revisit this promise with your sister, though. It's pretty clear that what was originally envisioned and what's happening now are two different things, at least for her, and the two of you need to work out (heh) what your exercise routines are going to look like going forward."
dbuw68,Sorry dude but nobody cares about this situation
dbv4ca,"NTA. Those two just wanted to hog the machine. It's customary for people to work in between sets, isn't it? I'm not super-up on gym lingo but if no one is actively working on a machine, *especially* if they have left the room, they can wait for their turn."
dbva3p,"NTA. First, it sounds like it is better for the animal to stay where it has become acclimated. Second, I feel like this is like squatters’ rights. This cat spent 80% of its life with you. If it were a senior cat she re-homed for a year it may be a different story. But you are all he knows. It is cruel to the cat and your family to change circumstances now. If she wants, she can easily rescue another cat in need and have spent just as much time with it as this one in a week or so."
dbvbke,"YTA

What did you hope to accomplish by speaking to the manager here, Karen?"
dbve3q,"ESH. She sucks, you suck, her parents suck. Don't get in the fucking car with her driving. It's not hard. 

>if a cop happens to pull her over, I'm screwed too, since I'm not old enough to be in the car with us two by ourselves if she is behind the wheel"
dbvkod,"NTA. I know it can be hard to let go of friends, but with somebody as nosy and intrusive as Mike, I would do the same. There are just some cases when it's not a good idea to be friends with somebody, even if it involves a friend group."
dbvlx4,NTA - It's a good idea to set a birthday policy for the new location. Many work places do the once a month celebration like the manager mentioned. It makes it fair to everyone and protects the company against accusations of favoritism. You have a right to express some concern.
dbvn9g,"NTA, but there probably will be a backlash if anyone (even people you wouldn't think like him) finds out it was you.  Try talking privately to your teacher so they know to be keeping an eye on him and leave it at that.  Then he'll think he got himself busted."
dbvnws,"> it sounds like the real issue is that you don't want her to be naked in front of other guys

To be honest, this doesn't sound unreasonable."
dbvpb3,"ESH. Yes, you'd be an asshole. If you want to call her out for undermining your opinion by calling you ""a young man"", then call her out without using any insult or trying to undermining her, but calmly and in a polite way."
dbvsgv,"NTA. Nope not at all, I encourage on. Go on."
dbvtqs,NTA. Who doesn't wash their face? What the fuck?
dbvvkm,NTA - asking how someone wants their name pronounced is just fine.
dbvwe8,NTA intellectually disabled kids need to learn boundaries too. It sucks that kid’s parents are teaching him properly.
dbw00n,"NTA, but I would go after the store itself, not the technician."
dbw0w3,"I'm not going to pass a judgement.


You might upset people.  That being said, I've seen a lot of guys dress up as Jesus in humorous ways and never seen an issue."
dbw4p7,YTA Why didn't you just get 2 small cakes? One she wanted and one that would be good for the office vegans?
dbw5pl,YWNBTA. Don’t give him anything until you have confirmed the payment. You guys agreed on $350 and that’s what the price is.
dbw7r3,"How feminist of her to automatically assume something another woman does is automatically for the purpose of adhering to a man's preferences.

NTA."
dbwaa6,"YTA - Can she never complain about anything ever because you have it harder. 

With that logic you can never complain about work because you’re not unemployed. 

An unemployed person can never complain because at least they’re not sick.

A sick person can never complain because at least they’re not dying.

A dying person can never complain because at least they’re still alive."
dbwato,NTA. this goes way past the point of a typical sibling fight. Your brothers suck and your mom sucks for enabling them. She wants you to keep the peace because it’s easier than admitting your brothers are assholes.
dbwe27,NTA - 30 days is reasonable. It will fly by for him and he'll likely want an extension so I'd say the real question here is: Are you ready to evict your friend after those 30 days pass?
dbwg4g,"NAH - BUT....you really should make an effort to go. 

The first two reasons are decent enough reasons and I can understand. The second two are very much personal things that I'd argue are not important to your GF and just wants to spend some quality time with you.

Everyone dance's like a stiff at first, you gotta get out of your comfort zone and you'll likely be surprised how much fun you can have awkwardly moving with someone you care about."
dbwi3u,"YTA 

DO NOT DO THIS. Do not cross the streams. This would be an excellent way to get yourself blacklisted from the entire industry.

Seriously. I cannot emphasize enough how terrible of an idea this is."
dbwkr3,NTA - You need to get people to give you a deposit so you wouldnt have to report them next time.
dbwn5w,ESH - He sucks for talking about bringing you to court over a phone and you suck for putting your weight somewhere it can fall on someone's foot.
dbwors,"NTA. Jesus Christ, her kid almost drowned and she was standing there smiling. No amount of apologizing is going to fix that."
dbwpqa,"YTA - if you're doing it out of spite, you're the asshole."
dbwss2,"NTA, he gave a lousy service"
dbwu2f,your wife sounds like TA here not u. NTA
dbwu2s,"YTA

I can understand your POV, but a gift with strings attached isn't a gift, and also, it has nothing to do with you, since you were neither the giver nor the receiver."
dbwz21,"From the way you described it, YTA.

""Why didn't they show more of my performance?""

""Well, you choked onstage.  They didn't want to show that.""

is different from

""You had trouble during part of the performance, so they just showed highlights.  I'm sure they did it with other performers, too.""

And at 12, he shouldn't be having to deal with you endorsing the ""cruelty"" of the ""sport.""  I'm not saying coddle him, but he's not in the big leagues.  He's fucking 12."
