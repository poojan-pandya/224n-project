dbx07q,"NTA. Your response is perfect. Stay the course until this generation is done. 

I once brought a friend home for Xmas when my mom was dating a cool guy with family of these people, his mom especially. He introduced himself and explained that since he couldn't fly back home to California, he was staying with me who he considered his ""New York family"" cue awwww. 2 sentences later Karen asks him how Christmas is celebrated in his culture.

Face-palm.

He took it in such stride, and answered ""Everything is pretty much the same in California except no snow! Glad to have snow this year.""

Stay classy, a bad reaction will only reflect on you."
dbx0gl,"NTA.  That kind of ex can mine your friends for information about you.  That affects your safety.  Even without the social implications, that alone is reason to cut ties."
dbx6op,she caught wild mice... to rerelease into the wild... somewhere else ?
dbx75g,"NTA. As a guest, I wouldn't expect a vegetarian host to cook meat. It wouldn't even cross my mind as a possibility."
dbx8p6,ESH. This behaviour on both sides is inappropriate for the workplace.
dbxg39,"YWBTA if you don't delete the picture, IMO. If this person is really your friend, I don't think it should be that big a deal for you to take the pic down--is it really any skin off your nose, especially since it seems to bother your friend?"
dbxgsd,"A couple of notes I thought I'd share:

I was a psych/biochemistry major in college, now in psychiatric drug research (PhD student studying psychiatric drug development). I'm not a clinician but based on what you shared he definitely doesn't need a second opinion. These are all super common symptoms, combined with the fact that he received a diagnosis from a psychiatrist who would be able to tell very easily (the tests/determinations for schizophrenia have very high validity and reliability). Secondly, based on what i've learned not only from taking classes but talking to clinicians, the scariest symptom a person can have is **command hallucinations**, which is, as it sounds, any sort of sensory perception (typically auditory in the form of voices) telling a person to do something. The reason why these are scary is because people usually act upon them, they tend to escalate, and the person truly believes they have to do what the voices say. A lot of high profile acts of violence (ex: Reagan's attempted assassination) are the result of command hallucinations. Schizophrenia is also degenerative, leading to worsening of the condition as it progresses. Schizophrenic patients lose brain volume, which can have an array of adverse effects. So while he may now be sweet and non-violent, this may change, and he's already ""compromised"" in the sense that he's suffering from these hallucinations already.

Based on this super long-winded basis, I would say you're definitely NTA and your BIL needs help. Your fear that he could turn violent without warning is very realistic given his symptoms, especially if he continues to not get treatment (although it sounds like his family is taking the steps to get him help)."
dbxhru,YTA - and I definitely get why your boyfriend is upset. You just proved you can be bought.
dbxklx,"NTA - accidents happen and the guy overreacted.

You asked him to stop because he was scaring you - shouldn't that make think hard about your relationship?"
dbxknp,"NAH, but oh my god do not let her go to the Philippines for a medical procedure just because it’s cheaper or quicker. Look up botched Philippines breast implants. That shit is unbelievably dangerous."
dbxwzx,"NTA.

She is derailing the game and not taking your setting seriously by trying to be a murder hobo. DnD is a communal game, meaningful decisions should be made by the players in response to situations setup by the GM. The GM curates the experience and the players engage with it in good faith.

As someone who has run a few games, here is an option to consider - let her act out in game and have the guards handle it."
dbxzhr,NTA.  Anyone who jams their hands in my face to ask for something is most definitely *not* getting anything.  They were rude to think that’s how you do things.  You were clearly being generous and if they’d simply asked nicely like a normal person they probably would have gotten some.

If you are splitting the bill, any savings promotion on that bill belongs to all of you.  As you said, there was probably a Samsung speaker or other electronics that everyone could have enjoyed.  If not, it would at least need to be discussed who gets what."

Yall suck because it's his birthday and listening to seone play piano is super boring for most people (source: I play the piano )"
dbyd9z,"NTA, you can't help someone who doesn't want help.  It's not your business.  If she seeks you out, that's a different story."
dbyf99,"YWNBTA

It's possible she doesn't understand how weird/creepy this is. Let her know that this makes you uncomfortable, but don't accuse her of being controlling. It's possible she's just being overly excited about this shiny new toy and isn't thinking about how it's making you feel."
dbyjta,"YTA stop trying to get a deal. The mom is the main landlord , accept the rent or find somewhere else"
dbymmj,"NTA- As long as you are respectful, you should definitely bring this up. She's young an inexperienced, but should know better than to blast alarms in a shared space for that long."
dbytnn,"NTA, you weren't being deceptive, he's just being manipulative."
dbytxn,YTA. You don’t get to go to parties for people who don’t like you.
dbyv8z,NTA but that was kinda confusing to follow. If I understood it right you’re NTA and should now worry about them
dbz0sh,NTA!  Do not say a thing to M.  You know this only as it pertains to your job.  If you share confidential information such as this you can get wrote up.  Show your boss they can trust you.
dbz1xt,NTA - if you don’t want him over you don’t have to
dbz3ke,"Uggggghhh, no NTA. What your boyfriend is saying is that he thought you’d be more comfortable letting him control you by now. You’re doing nothing wrong at all."
dbz75n,NTA - Ask and you shall receive. Not like you warned them before or they have to use it.
dbz95m,"YTA. What the fuck man? You actually have no idea if he went through the proper channels. What purpose did it serve to warn Aaron? You gave him a heads up and not Blake that his boss was suspicious of him? He may have acted pompously, but everyone deserves to work in a safe and professional environment. You may have tipped off the boss enough that the company can skate by an investigation and then return to not giving a fuck afterwards."
dbzckv,"LOL... pop out a cube next time he gets dismissive and solve it in 30 seconds, then have him try. Getting embarrassed in front of girls at parties a few times after opening his mouth about how it's not a big deal should shut him up. NTA"
dbzido,"A lot of people here probably aren't going to understand what a finsta is, fair warning.

I don't think you're a bad person for venting about a relationship, but you also have to accept that all social media is technically public once you allow anyone but yourself to enter a space. Anyone can leak it at any time. 

NAH, she has a right to be upset but if anyone goes and talks to her then they can make their own judgment. Hell, my current boyfriend of a year was talked about on his ex's finsta and he isn't a bad guy to me now that I actually heard both sides of the story."
dbziyn,"Bills are split by roommates, theoretical bills are not.  If you're making a personal profit off your bill split, something isn't even now is it?

dbzk34,"YTA

He was being good enough to provide you with the account that was really important to you and you kind of disregarded and disrespected him in return. Then you were shocked... SHOCKED... that he took back the toys you were borrowing from him in order to disrespect him."

IF there is a fire, they’ll destroy her car to access the hydrant, so you might be doing her a favor. 

Plus f*ck ppl who block emergency service stuff.

Edit: grammar"
dbzqdz,"YTA. It was her home and her mother. Being “tired of hearing it” is a selfish reason for telling her to stop.

I speak Spanish and English. My SO speaks Arabic and English. His Mother speaks Dutch and English. My daughter is learning Spanish and my son is learning German. Of course there will be conversation that not everyone will understand. That’s modern life."
dbzrcg,"NTA. It doesn't sound like you're joining the military to avoid having to care for your father it sounds like you're joining the military for unrelated reasons and are going to not be able to care for your father because you are in the military oh, and frankly you might be able to do more to help your father financially or what not if you had a stable career rather than if you were the actual caretaker"
dbzyqg,"NAH, he doesn’t owe you to tell you about something he is doing to his own body, but at the same time I understand why it would be nice to just let you know beforehand."
dc0229,NTA. Your uncle is a greedy dick. This sounds like a bad movie plot tbh
dc0325,"NTA.  Even without the story of your coworker being a jerk.  It is YOUR chair.  It doesn't matter if you use it to hold files between uses.  It is the companies obligation to purchase a chair and if he can't wait until they have the money, he should invest in his own or bring one from home."
dc0cef,"By 'serve your nation', do you mean join the army?
Because you're TA for thinking he should be forced to do that. That law is bullshit.
But you're NTA for criticising your friend for being lazy.
As a gamer myself, I get the appeal of them.
But he's a grown man and needs to prove he can act like it if he wants to go overseas"
dc0dei,YTA. If your brother knew the price from the start he would pay half of it. You don't deserve the 90%. It's 50/50. Don't be a selfish asshole.
dc0e7s,"NTA, BECAUSE, she said that the truth needed to be said to someone all the while insulting her daughter, which like you said isnt the way to go about things. I will admit though, it's kinda petty, lol."
dc0f8u,"NTA - Dude, grow a spine! A valid answer is no. In the case of the Uncle, asking for a specific date is not out of bounds. Don't get bullied."
dc0gd0,"YTA for agreeing to this method of repayment. If you didn’t want this, you shouldn’t have taken the money. Finish your work, fill out the form, and move on."
dc0k7n,"YTA

I love traveling, and I often run off during the holidays. My SO and I often travel without each other, and don't believe partners need to be on every trip.

 But THREE years in a row you do this to your girlfriend for both Christmas and New Years?? 

Holy smokes. When will special occasions with her become a priority? I'd be more than pissed. Ya, you're at a point you're totally committed to the trip, so too late. But spending the holidays with your girlfriend three years into a relationship should have been a consideration well before now. 

Year one I get. Year two, I'd be hurt. Year three I'd start weighing whether I could rely on my partner to actually prioritize me, and probably start planning my exit strategy."

dc0r0r,"YTA.  


Preston is an annoying jerk.  I have no quibble with that.  


You don't like Preston. I have no quibble with that.  


But you literally invited everybody else in your class but him.  


Your ability to throw parties rests solely on being lucky enough to have parents who let you do it.    


You're a lucky kid. And you used this advantage to basically bully Preston.  


He wasn't asking to come in and be your first gay kiss.  He just didn't want to be excluded from an event that literally everyone else in his grade was attending.  


You did a lot of harm.  You achieved no good. That was a jerk move. Preston may be a complete douche, but unless he was going to ruin your party, you didn't need to exclude him.  


You CHOSE to exclude him. Yes, you CAN do that. But not-being an asshole is a higher bar than that.  We CAN do anything that's not explicitly illegal  


And being emtionally cruel to people isn't usually illegal.  The law won't stop you. Only your basic human decency can do that.  


There's a huge difference betwen ""legally within my rights"" and being a good person."
dc0sjt,"NTA. You've made several requests that she's ignored, and she's taking advantage of you doing her a favor. Give her 2 weeks to get out and stick to it. 

Don't bring up her finances though, that's none of your business. 

&#x200B;

>She also seems to have a habit of making subtle digs towards me that stick with me and upset me a little. For example, she called me a bipolar bitch when I was having a down day and belittled the fact I went to the doctor to get medication.

I don't know if ""subtle"" means what you think it means."
dc10zk,"NTA. I cut off contact with my mother when I was just a little older than you, and it was the best decision I ever made. I'm happier, less anxious, less stressed and healthier.

It sounds like your mom has major problems. But you can't fix her, and you aren't obligated to go down with that ship.

I would suggest trying to calmly explain to her that her issues have taken too much of a toll on you. For now, you need her to respect your space and not call or email. In the future, if she works on getting her life together, you may reinitiate contact, but one way or another, it won't be any time soon.

Sorry you're going through this, and best of luck."
dc17oo,"NAH. I'm going to go out on a limb and say maybe your mom is going through some stuff and she was embarrassed or ashamed there was no food and so she took it out on you. Not saying she is justified in that at all, just saying that maybe your mom has a lot going on right now. I'm sorry that she took away your electronics and gave you a lot of chores--that seems pretty unreasonable. But maybe if you talk to her later, after she has time to think about everything, she'll ease up on you. You sound like a good kid. Hang in there. :)"
dc19gv,YTA - She's your plaything and your are old enough to understand you are wasting a portion of her life. You should just breakup now.
dc1ap1,"NTA.  If she's having trouble making rent or can't afford to go out, she can't go out.  It's a shame, but you should definitely still go.  Definitely take your mom!"
dc1bo9,"YTA, not trusting your own brother, kicking his girlfriend out when you don't even live there anymore and

dc1e2u,"ESH

You are a kid. You haven't learned yet how to deal with testy situations, but you have YEARS to learn. :)

Next time someone, ANYONE, says anything to you while you are in the middle of doing something, say ""hi! gimme a minute to settle myself here"" regardless of what the other person has said to you. Just ignore ALL of it and only acknowledge that you see them.

Once you have taken a moment to hang up the phone, finish dealing with your umbrella, straightening up your clothing, whatever, turn to the person and say something like ""hi! all settled now"" and either let them repeat what they said, or ask them how their day is/went/what they need, etc., depending on the situation.

This allows both them AND you a moment to catch a breath before either of you say something that can cause a situation to blow up like this one did. 

Relationships of ALL types will move in and out of your life. You cannot, and never will be, able to control how someone else acts or what they say, but you CAN control how you act and what you say. 

It is ALWAYS better to take a moment for yourself before you say something."
dc1fkl,"NTA. A big ole ""fuck that"" to what she's demanding. Even if you had agreed to drive her every day to wherever her heart desired, you still would have always had the option to change your mind. Stick to your own commute that works best for you."

If I were you? I’d air it publicly on the discord or social media. “I’m being threatened with being kicked from this tournament because I blocked a staff member who attacked me, here’s the receipts.”

I’m not sure if you want to go that route, but public pressure might change their tune imho

EDIT: just reread the bit about feminine people. 

Yeah for sure air this publicly. They are enabling an abuser. This dude is red flags city and this should NOT be his position."
dc1iy0,"NTA, but I hate to break it to you but if what you wrote is true you’ve gotten caught up In a very unfortunate and unhealthy marriage dynamic that you need to address with your wife."
dc1siy,"YTA. You invited him along. It’s pretty rude, even though you warned him in advance, to say “we will pay for everyone but you”. That’s pretty goddamn rude."
dc1wch,"NAH, but they probably felt like you didn't trust them or thought they would ridicule you and that hurt they're feelings. Just explain you were trying to avoid making a fuss."
dc1wf9,"NTA, but you need to move on. Talk to someone who DOES want to hang out with you."
dc1wql,"NTA. This is just petty high school drama that will get left in the dust when college arrives. If they can’t handle you meeting new people and making new friends they aren’t worth your time 5-10 years from now lol

dc21ns,"My guess is YTA.  If at 20 you already have friends or loved ones complaining about your behavior while drinking you might want to look into that.  You seem awfully keen to prove you ""don't act bad"" when you drink.  That's generally a red flag."
dc225l,"I can understand being frustrated at having to move all the time, but I have to say it sounds like your dad really loves you and is trying his hardest to make you more comfortable at his house; he didn't just shell out money (which is easy if you have it), some of your list items meant he had to have some conversations with his wife and stepkids about their behavior around you, and people typically don't like having those kinds of talks, so for him to willingly do it because you asked it of him speaks volumes as to how much he wants you around. I hope your visits get easier to deal with soon."
dc250o,"NTA. But as a WC adjuster, I wouldn’t be able to terminate any of his benefits unless there was video proof. But letting them know is how they will know to hire a detective to follow and record him."
dc2e93,"NTA. Nicu nurse here. Having a micropreemie in the nicu is very stressful for families, and you need to do what you can to help with that. If that means your SIL doesn't visit unless you are present, then that's what you should do. Hubby needs to support you in this."
dc2ebz,"NAH- You can't have your older dog being attacked on a regular basis; that's not fair to that dog. I'm sure the pit mix is  quite upset that your ex is gone, and it sounds like he requires more attention/supervision than you are able to provide (not a judgement call against OP by any means, I promise!). Since your home seems to no longer be a good fit for the pit mix, the best thing would be to re-home him. Just make sure it's really a good fit before you let him go!

I am a bit curious about the decision to get a cat after re-homing the dog. If you are getting rid of the pit mix *specifically* so that you can get a cat, then that would make you TA. However, If you are getting rid of the pit mix because of the attacks on the older dog, and because he requires more one-on-one time than you can provide, that's a different story altogether in which there are NAH."
dc2efk,"NTA- buuuut

Don't ever tell her. Just get them back and burn them and when she asks where they are just say you have no idea. Seriously I'm saving you right now"
dc2eme,I'd say something again. Because ya 3 times over 2 years is nothing. They probably don't even remember you saying anything. I'd just go to them and be like hey the smell has been really bothering me is there anyway you xan smoke outside?

dc2i2s,"NTA.  


If she doesn't remember saying it, the decent thing to say is, ""I honestly do not remember ever saying that.  However you seem very sure that I did.  I don't agree with that sentiment, now. And I'm very, very sorry that you suffered because of this.  I don't remember saying this, but if you say I did? I'm sorry and please understand that I don't believe this, now.""  


anything short of that? she's being a stubborn asshole. At BEST.  


At worst, this still reflects how she feels."
dc2jei,NTA. Would have been nice if he had just offered you the $10 for a beer or lunch to get lost though. Why go to the trouble of potentially hurting your feelings by going behind your back? I'd be a little pissed tbh.
dc2jqm,"I understand that. I wouldn't have made them fettuccine alfredo because that is obviously unhealthy. There was no mention of ""I can't have any mayo in my diet"", and maybe I'm wrong but I figured a tunfish sandwhich, tomato soup, and whole grain chips would be considered a ""healthy"" meal compared to the vast majority of food that college kids eat."
dc2jqq,"ESH. He has an addiction and shouldn't be lying to you about it. But you've known he's been a smoker for 9 years. It's foolish of you to think that you can change him/end his addiction just by making him promise not to smoke.

He'll quit for good when he's ready. In the meantime, you need to decide if you want to date a smoker or not."
dc2kg9,"NTA. 

You were followed home by a stranger who threatened to trespass in your yard. You told them clearly that they were not permitted to do such a thing. They did it anyways stating clearly that they didn't care. 

It might be a child, but the child clearly knew they were in the wrong. You do not have to be nice to someone who trespasses and refuses to leave."
dc2nzt,"NTA- I mean a white lie would have been preferable, but it sounds like you were painted into a corner by already telling her the place was free? I think you were truthful, albeit direct."
dc2poa,"Lol. NTA. 

You went to stay with your father's side of the family who haven't been in contact with you since you were 4 under the assumption that they wanted to know you now. 

They did not try to make you feel comfortable in their home. Instead they did the exact opposite. 

Your autism doesn't matter here. A lot of the things they have done go against what normal levels of hospitality should be in such a situation. They acted poorly even without taking into account your sensory issues and social anxiety and whatnot. 

Your behaviour, from what you have described, is also not abnormal and should not be expected to have been different. To be thirst into a situation like this is a totally different state with a bunch of strangers is incredibly difficult for anyone. Even a neurotypical adult would have a hard time. For a family trying to get to know you the focus should have been on making you feel more socially comfortable. Any issues they had with your phobias or sensory processing or whatnot should have been left for another time, and should have been addressed with your mum not you. 

It sounds like that side of your family is a side you're better off not knowing."
dc2rg6,"YTA for not just having two flower girls. Like, why was this even an issue in the first place?"
dc2rl9,NTA - For just 3 days with a bunch of people you don't know it's not worth it. I'm getting sick of these expensive hen dos brides are throwing but also don't want to spend any of their own money on. You can go on a week long holiday of your choice with that money.

It’s one thing for the child to just be existing at home, yes there might be some screaming, he might jump off of stuff and his the ground hard...but I don’t think it’s okay for the kid to make a habit of pounding on walls.

Either you talk to the parents kindly about it, and also be understanding that it would mean they have to do more parenting than they are used to doing, or try talking to the land lord about it."

dc3lto,"NTA - They offered the holiday as a gift, and the fact that he pays for your step mother's children while she doesn't do the same for you is unfair"
dc3lu4,"YTA, but not because what you did was offensive, which is why I suspect you think you're the asshole. Offending someone or being offensive does not automatically make you an asshole - context matters.

You put yourself in a position where you either had to lie or eat a serious penalty to your grade. By getting shitfaced *the day before an important presentation*, you put yourself in a position to where you had to sell your integrity to avoid the consequences of getting shitfaced.

THAT'S why you're the asshole. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't that big of a deal. But this kind of thing gets people in very real trouble all the time. Never put yourself in a position to where you either have to lie or accept an unacceptable penalty."

>I find that's a pretty inappropriate relationship to begin with.

That's NORMAL. They're what, 1-1.5 years apart? Jeez. 



>brags all the time about how pretty she is, and probably says 2-3 times a day to me and my husband about how much he loves her

He's a teenager. Hormones are a thing. Puppy love is a thing. Chill. 




>it feels like he's rubbing it in my face that he cares about someone else and not me

This is just...strange. It's time to cut the cord, lady. Accept that you won't be the only female I'm his life from here on out. 



>I'm afraid that this is going to lead to them having sex,

Now here, I agree he's too young. But I'd start mentally preparing NOW because one day sooner than later he will have sex. 



>his grades dropping.

Do the parenting thing and set boundaries and make rules. If he wants to see her and his friends, he's gotta maintain his grades. 



>He acts like I am the devil, because I don't necessarily approve of her and I've made this known.

It's fucking bizarre how you act and feel towards this CHILD. Like...what. This whole post really just seems like you need to accept that your baby boy is growing up. 

Friendly advice. The more resistance you show towards your teenager about things you dont approve of, the more they'll actually do whatever you're against AND do it behind your back. I'm not surprised he acts like you're the devil considering how you already hate his first girlfriend and how you react towards her."
dc3w4v,"NAH. He tried to do something nice, doesn't sound like he intended to trick you or lie about the eggs. But it's also not your fault that you can't stomach eggs. Just a poor misunderstanding!"

dc5fj4,"I’m not going to judge whether you would be the asshole or not, but I am going to share my story. 

I’m a gay guy, and my grandmother died 18 years ago. We were very close. I spent time at her house once a week, and would stay with her for a week or two each summer. When she was dying, and went on hospice, instead of hiring help, my parents and I took shifts and gave her 24 hour care. In that time we grew much closer, and my grandmother showed me a softer side of her I had never seen before. It was clear she was mentally getting herself ready to die. 

One night in one of her last few weeks, when she was only awake a couple hours a day, she asked me if I like girls. I honestly wasn’t entirely sure what she meant, so I asked. She told me that she wanted to know if I liked boys or girls—because she didn’t mind if I liked boys, except she knows how cruel the world can be, and how people who are different often get treated, and how sad that made her. And she hoped that I like girls, for the sole fact that life was hard enough without having something make it harder. 

I might never forget the tone of her voice as she said, “I know how they get treated...it’s so sad.”

I wasn’t sure what to tell her. But I felt that she was really asking to know that I would be okay when she was gone. And even though I knew she was right, and that being gay would make life harder for me, I also knew that I would be okay. 

So it seemed like the most compassionate thing for her, and also for me in that moment, to tell her that I like girls. I didn’t have to tell her that I was going to date them, or marry them. Even if not in the way I knew she meant, I do like girls. 

I don’t regret choosing not to come out to her. Is the fact that I’m gay central to my relationship with her? No. It was much more important that she loved me and wanted the best for me.  It was much more important that in that moment I was able to offer her some inner peace the way she had so often taken care of me. 

I think the question isn’t whether you would be an asshole not. I think the question is which relationship would be hurt more, and which relationship would recover more easily? Your relationship with yourself if you don’t tell her? Or your relationship with her if you do tell her?

If not telling her would be a burden you have to carry, maybe you should. It wasn’t for me. Maybe you could let go of the idea that she should know. 

But it’s also possible that telling her would cause strife that becomes its own heavy burden. 

If you want to get married and have children, you can focus on that part without saying or even agreeing that it would be a woman you marry and parent with. There are ways to reply tactfully without outrightly lying. 

It’s for you to decide if you should tell her or not. But get clear on why you’d be telling her. Or get clear on why you may choose not to tell her. Both courses of action have their cost. But the clearer you are on why you chose one over the other, the more easily you can reconcile the effects of your actions on everyone involved."
dc5jo9,"YTA for ghosting someone you say is your best friend. It's very possible for two people who communicate well not to have arguments (which I define as yelling, screaming, leaving the house, hurt feelings, etc. You didn't go into detail about your interactions with SO so I might be projecting my own interpretation. Take with a grain of salt). I've been married for almost that same time period and we have yet to argue in any way that makes me so mad I want to text someone and vent about him. We don't always see eye to eye, but we talk about it and communicate how we're feeling, why that is, discuss that it's possible there's no rational reason for this but it doesn't change the feeling, say what we need from the other to feel better or do better... point being, not all couples ""argue."" 

She may be sugar coating things, she may be really good at communicating, or she may just not want to air her dirty laundry with you. But if she's your best friend, you should communicate how you feel and be willing to be vulnerable."

dc5r3j,"A lot of my friendships have ended without formal explanations. If things can peacefully fizzle out that's fine.

dc5tr3,"YTA.

> Am I really obligated to take of her loans?

No, you're not. It's technically your money. But you're still an asshole if you don't help her out even a little bit.

This is your wife. The love of your life. The woman you ostensibly want to spend the rest of your life with. By your own admission, she is struggling with an issue that has taken hold of her life. And you really don't want to give, I repeat, your OWN WIFE a single penny towards fixing that? In my opinion, that is indicative of an asshole.

Let me put it this way. Why should you set aside any money for your child? It's your money. What's that? You love them and want to meet needs for them that they can't meet themselves? Huh, what a novel concept.

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not advocating for you to pay off these loans in their entirety. IMO, you not wanting to pay for ANY of them is the primary issue here."
dc5vj1,"YTA

Let me see if I can summarize:

It seems like the root issue was that you were asked to be home at a certain time and said you would... then decided to go do whatever you felt like at the time you said you would be home. Your Dad didn't appreciate his request being disregarded and you lying to him, but for some reason was still cool with your boyfriend staying the night. For some reason I can't understand your boyfriend is really pissed off at this point... apparently he really want to go to the movies or bowling or something? 

You then proceed to ignore your parents completely after all this and they call around to your boyfriends parents looking for you. You feel this is some sort of betrayal instead of normal behavior for parents who's kid has already lied to them once about coming home after they said they would that night, but you know it will anger your easily angered boyfriend, so you don't tell him. Your father then calls him and that is how he finds out that you are actually at home. 

Your boyfriend is really angry (I really don't get this guy) so he gets his parents to come pick him up and while your outside you get a message that your dad wants to talk. You refuse to talk to your father still. Your father is strangely angered after you lied to him multiple times and then didn't even let him know you were home after he let your angry boyfriend  stay the night. You get pissed that he is pissed and say you will run away. Your boyfriends parents you talk you out of it. 

&#x200B;

Did I get that right? Because in how I am reading it you were a jerk to your father all night and pretty much everything he did seems reasonable. Seriously, how do you think someone should react to you lying to them a bunch?

I also really don't get your boyfriend who seems just mad all the time but for no reason... he can be the asshole too then.

This really doesn't read like you guys are adults. The rules being set on you don't make sense for an adult. The way you respond and treat other people doesn't sound like an adult... pretty much this whole thing makes way more sense (other than letting your boyfriend stay the night) if you were 14."
dc5vne,"YTA if you ""**confront""** her. If you're genuinely interested in repairing the relationship then you need to have a calm and rational talk with her.

If you really think you cant go back to being friends then just leave things as it is. I doubt you'll get an apology if you confront her."
dc5w3m,"I'll go with NTA, but I don't think you should call her out on that post. What's the point? She likely won't apologize anyway.

To be honest, I don't think you should call her a friend in the first place. She seems extremely self-interested, and toxic AF."
dc5wuy,NTA--He didn't keep his word. He has no integrity. This doesn't mean you have to cut him out of your life just don't do business with him anymore.

So here is the thing with kids... you have to make the choices that will be best for them not what will make them happiest in the moment. 

Saying that you don't want an alcoholic who is active in their disease to be around kids... seems pretty reasonable. 

That said, hate the disease not the person. If she can show she is sober again then give her a chance again... not ""all is forgiven"" though, have good boundaries and she has to earn trust back on your terms. Your job is to protect those kids from her so that if she does come back into their lives it will be in a positive way."
dc62ng,NTA in my opinion. We all have preferences and we can’t help that. More like your friend is the asshole for making a deal out of something so insignificant to begin with.

dc6n2x,"It wasn't intentional on your part, but YTA. 

**it's been one week** His being upset over being single isn't an indication he needs a new gf and that will fix everything, it means he's still processing the breakup. (very normal. it's been **one week!**) For your first option/contact to be setting him up on a  date is... incredibly tone deaf. Particularly to have the date offer come from you, the person he's getting over. 

If you really wanted to go down this path, it should have been a friend mutual to both of them (who is not you) setting it up or even her asking him herself. you should have been as out of it as humanly possible."

It's also odd to do this as a joint fund. Shouldn't each couple just buy their stuff for dinner and the ""food fund"" be for various shared items like bread and milk ect? otherwise you run into people having budgeting conflicts, particularly with different wealth levels. 


**However** do keep in mind that a fair chunk of socialising revolves around mealtimes, you guys may be missing out on that by not contributing a couple days. Consider offering to do takeout days, cook very simple and easy meals, ect at least a couple times, and ideally put in enough money so that your portions of dinner will be covered should you choose to join them on occasion or eat some of the leftover for lunch (or just chuck them some money each time. more than enough money is better.)"

Before you do that, though, there are things you can do to try to help the dog improve. Look up videos and guides online about dog training, or hire a trainer to help with her behavioural issues. All you've written can actually be tackled pretty easy with training and a little consistency. The barking at guests, the dog aggression. You can fix the issues and help your dog be happier, because aggression in dogs is often just a response to fear, stress and anxiety. She sounds like a lovely animal, and it would be a really big shame for her to be separated from you when you're clearly her safe space. Talk to your partner about putting the work in to get her trained so that both parties are happy and the dog can stay."

Growing up with a brother of my own, my parents were always careful to ensure neither of us were treated better or worse than the other. If one of us was given x amount of money, then so would the other.

eg. While at university, our mother gave us each £150 a month to cover living expenses that then dropped to £100 a month once we had a job.

It sounds like your parents might be unconsciously playing favourites but I could be wrong. Maybe they see the covering of your medication as a fair exchange but I would  say that since it is essential for you that that is not fair."

I think we need to take into consideration what our peers say about our behavior. In some countries, sharing a table at dinner is normal and refusing to let someone sit is the height of rude. In other societies, sitting down at a table with a stranger is considered pushy and awkward. Certain behavior, in isolation, is not rude or wrong by itself--it depends entirely on how our peers view them. 

So if your peers are telling you that this costume is likely to be considered rude, then you run the risk of being seen as an asshole. The show itself is pretty cool and I think the costume sounds interesting. I just think you have to take into consideration whether you want the fallout from wearing a costume your peers find offensive or that might hurt someone who survived that disaster. 

There is also a small risk of things like this getting out of control if people truly are feeling social media trigger happy. Not saying it will happen, but the only reason you would be an asshole is because your peer group says you are."

Instead of trying to understand her feelings, your response to her is to *cut down on the time she gets to see her dad* (are you kidding me? The fact that he’d even allow this says a lot about him as a parent, too), in order to prioritize your potential new baby.

dcjpp8,"NTA.  It would have been inappropriate and unfair to bring him.  FAFSA is dreadful enough for adults, let alone dragging a 4 yr old along."
dcjr34,"NTA. Everyone, especially special needs kids if he is one, needs to learn social cues. I realize your generation values kindness and uniqueness more than mine (GenX), but there comes a time when some negative social attention/pressure applied in just the right amount is actually good. 

Please allow me to explain. 

I’m a mom of 14yo twin boys. Both are on the autism spectrum and have other sorts of mental health issues. They were born early after a very risky pregnancy. One of my sons is a bit further on the spectrum which has actually resulted in a very confident and intelligent dude. His twin, however, had seriously obnoxious behaviors tied to some of his issues. We tried everything to help this kid. We live in Massachusetts and our school system is fricking awesome. We are so lucky to live here. 

Years of IEPS, therapy, paraprofessionals, you name it didn’t work nearly as well as having one kid in his class stand up to him and really fucking tell him to knock his shit off. And you know what?? 

IT

FUCKING

WORKED!!

A year later and my son has finally looked outside himself to see how his behavior was affecting others. He put it best: Not everyone knows their the bully. 

I would like to gently suggest that you speak to a guidance counselor about what happened. This way, if he needs some support at home he can get it. That’s his parents’ job... not yours. Peace."

If you want a new keyboard then find a way to earn the money yourself and buy it."
dcjwxt,YTA if you “confront” her because you said she usually shares your food so how would she know not to eat the peanut butter? I think it would be ok to nicely ask her not to eat it in the future though because you don’t get it that often.

People say lots of stuff they don't mean when they are in pain and under stress. However that doesn't lessen the way you feel. Self advocating is important especially when you are a care taker. This is a stressful time for your mom being hospitalized. And food is one of the few things they have a choice over and let me tell you its patients most complained about topic. When people are in the hospital they have so little control over what's going on that they try to control whatever they can, in this case its berating family and the food. This is NORMAL. Take a breathe and even a day or two and reach back out. Hopefully the distance and time will allow both of you to get back into communication.  

I have been working in the medical field for 9 years.  First bedside as a medic and now I work in management. Self care is important. And she's acting the way a lot of terminal patients act. Don't sweat it you are handling this right :)"
dcjzbi,"NAH. Communicate that you have a routine. If you finish, and want to talk, go for it. If it throws you off, any non asshole would be OK with it.

This is basically a real life equivalent of ""not until after my coffee"""
dcjzob,"NTA, but if you have bills to pay and don't have savings, don't quit until you have another offer."
dck46f,"NTA, I've been in a similar situation, but with a pretty solid HR department to back me up. I'd push harder on management, they are allowing you to be subjected to sexual harassment by a coworker, at a certain point this could turn into a legal problem for them."
dck4i1,NTA. You have no obligation to keep toxic people in your life just because you're related to them.
dck4sd,"Yeah, it’s very exhausting and I’ve felt a lot better not having to be under the weight of someone else’s unrealistic expectations."
dck65m,Nta but almost definitely getting fired for it.
dck715,"NTA. Reminds me of a psychology study I read years ago. I tried to find it but the closest I could get was this:  [https://fs.blog/2014/11/mind-gym-relationships/](https://fs.blog/2014/11/mind-gym-relationships/)

Basically, people ignoring bids like this is a **huge** predictor of relationship breakdowns and you're right to flag it and feel worried."
dck72m,"NAH- a lot of young women- and it’s obvious you are young- get frozen when guys ask them out when they aren’t interested.  They are taught to be polite and feel trapped into saying yes to avoid conflict.  Once you guys are older, a ton of this dissipates as people get more comfortable the cruelty of dating. Good luck, kiddo, and cut her some slack."
dck739,"NTA
Apparently Steve Jobs spent his last days furious with himself for wasting time with alternative medicines.

dck846,NTA - she should be responsible for paying until November 24th because she is on the lease. Anything after that is what you have to pay for.

If the grandmother is clearly failing to burp your child properly, you have every right to have someone else (such as the mother) do it.  And the mother would very much like to know about these opinions."
dckfv0,"NTA. Your friend has chosen to go into a line of work that is becoming more and more obsolete. Why would any sane person ever use a middleman to book flights on Southwest?  You can search for and book the exact flight you want on southwest.com and then you can also cancel/change it later at the click fo a button. There's no need for a travel agent.

That said, I have never booked a hotel through an airline and I'm not sure it's ever advantageous for you to do that. All they do is route you through their own in house travel agency.  If you use your friend to book the hotels, she gets like a 10% commission. If you use southwest to book your hotels, you get nothing and she gets nothing.  I assume she will take a credit card if you book with her so again, I don't know why you would book the hotel through Southwest.

I always book hotels directly through the hotel when possible.  You usually get the best rates that way, unless your friend is offering you a discount. And some hotels give the best rooms and benefits and points  to customers who book directly and the crappiest rooms and no points and benefits to customers who book through commission-based travel agents."
dckg02,"NTA

Sounds both degrading and kinky, it’s understandable to not want to put yourself in a position like that."
dckg0h,NTA she accepted that trip under false pretenses and clearly had no intentions of being honest.
dckhv5,NTA I'd feel the exact same. However I'd tell them exactly how I felt and their response would help me decide next steps.
dckj8l,"YTA your friends arent a piggy bank, a dinner or two is one thing ""nothing over $3000"" is another"
dckq7e,"NTA, nothing wrong with wanting a special food item that you bought for yourself FOR yourself"
dckrua,NTA. You’re running the business and mowing their lawn. You are doing your part even though you can’t be by his side.
dckt8b,ESH. Her for lying and not just being honest. You for not letting it go. She blocked you and you used a different account to keep talking shit to her. Smh.
dckzdm,"NTA, the sale is made, you don't have any obligations, other than delivery. 

If he wants the winter cover, it would need to be bought separately, as it was not part of the original agreement."
dcl0gf,"NTA. While it may not feel the greatest right now, you were looking out for yourself and your SO. He wasn’t a close friend or someone you even really had regular contact with. Follow your gut."
dcl0ra,NTA but the fact that he has a disability is irrelevant.
dcl0yo,"The scenario you’re describing does sound like A: they are running an illegal laundromat out of their home and also B: unreasonably noisy at odd hours. Since you already tried talking to them in a civil way and that didn’t help, YWNBTA if you looped in the management of your complex. You have a right to not be exposed to noise pollution, and the complex would not want them running this illegal business if that’s what going on. They can investigate the situation and take it from there."
dcl3ui,"YTA -- Why not find something SHE'S interested in and do that with her, instead of basically forcing her to do the thing you and your son are into, or she gets half the car he does."
dcl6nz,"You. Are. 20. Years. Old. Why on earth are you putting up with this? 

NTA. She’s controlling, manipulative, and abusive and you know it. Get out while you can. 

Oh and go here for some perspective and support...

dcl8lz,"Not gonna give judgement on this one. 

People who haven’t switched up their lives to care for an elderly, disabled, or terminally ill family member do not understand and will never. It’s so incredibly frustrating and even more so when they aren’t able bodied. 
Coming from someone who is in this situation, take care of yourself OP.  It’s hard. It doesn’t get easier. But it’s your family member and you love them, so this is what you do. Sometimes blowing up at them really cannot be helped, especially if they’re really being an ass that day. 
But most of the time they can’t help it either. They’re disabled and trapped.  They’re frustrated too."
dclcgq,He bites food you are holding in your hand??! I would freak. It is totally normal and healthy to set boundaries and expect people to respect them. And if your friend cannot accept you—boundaries and Aspergers included—then they’re not much of a friend.
dcljlb,"NTA

I absolutely hate when someone won't give directions when asked. Give me the damn address or at least a landmark.  (X park in Somewhereville is enough). I can plug it into my maps and get the directions instead of wandering around in random directions. 

I was going with E-S-H, but I'm like you. The more I think about it, the more it infuriates me."
dcln04,"NAH... if she asks. If she asks for your opinion on her relationship I would give an evidenced-based opinion (i.e. “remember when you made a fancy dinner and they just went out drinking instead”). From my experience people who are insecure in their relationships ask their friends if they think it’s good a lot, so there should be an opportunity. 


I had a situation with a hard headed friend that was in a horrible relationship and because I voiced my opinion without asking I almost lost her friendship. I would just keep it quiet and support her but you can try to work it in slightly (“oh they ditched you again? That seems like a pattern. How does that make you feel?”)"
dcln7y,"NTA

He is supposed to be providing a needed service to a student. If Sam can get there on time, Jack should be able to as well. He is being disrespectful to you, as the client, to your mother, and to his co-worker. You are spending too much time out of class due to his poor time management. Your mother is likely missing work. Sam may be late for other meetings or clients due to it.

If talking to him doesn't do the trick, talk with his superior."
dclo2a,"Dude, this is not normal friend behavior. She sounds extremely obsessive."
dclqc1,Don't lend family money if you ever intend on seeing it again just don't. But NTA
dclqwp,"Ehhh... NAH. It is your right to keep your controller at home, but it is pretty annoying and they’re allowed to be a little annoyed. 

Just FYI though, those things can take a beating. I have kids, the controllers fall and get dropped on the hard laminate floor. We cringe, but the controllers live on working fine. 

I suggest bringing it, and just putting it away in a backpack somewhere safe as soon as you’re done with crash for the time. It doesn’t have to stay there, just come when you do. Just an idea, then you can all have fun and play together."
dcls8c,"Oh love. I promise you in a few years this will all seem like the greatest, most petty bullshit of your life. Sure, it would have felt amazing to have that role. But the entire ensemble and smaller characters also lost, and it sucks because you’re all likely going to do what theater kids do best and complain and wallow in pity. Just have fun and enjoy the time you have now to perform and be on a stage and sing and enjoy life with your friends. You’re going to miss these times, and if you continue with acting/vocal performance you’ll have many many more opportunities to come. You’ll be fine, I’ve been in your shoes, and I swear life will just get better. Whatever you do, don’t talk poorly about your friend, and don’t engage with others who do. You would regret that for years to come."

You share a small room with someone else. The flickering light off the game plus the noises you are likely making while playing can make it difficult for someone to get to sleep. 

He DID ask you to turn it off.

> “man, can you turn that off?! 

He only demanded it when you played dumb.

> “like... the Xbox?” 

Then you proceed to walk right into AH territory by continuing to play until he had to stare you down."
dclx1k,NTA but she is totally going to run away with your dog at some point in the near future.
dclxmh,NTA. Everyone in a shared enviroment should use headphones if they are the only ones watching TV/listening to music/playing videogames.
dclxow,NTA But you really shouldn't have weighted on her. You should have taken it to your professor.

dclyos,NTA ... sounds like it’s warranted!
dcm62g,[deleted]
dcm728,"NTA. 

You're enabling him. Doing all that stuff for him is just allowing him to continue doing what he is doing. I would Def be taking your car back as frankly he doesn't seem like he would be the most responsible with it.  But that's not a time out or anything that's just common sense."
dcm7u2,"NTA
Absolutely you should withdraw and you should be honest about why. It sounds like coercion to me and the lawyer should be aware of it."
dcma7t,"NTA...I mean I wouldnt have done it because they could have beat your ass. I think a lot of people wouldnt believe yoire intentions are so good...that being said I'd appreciate it. It would tell me someone in the neighborhood cares, I need to be less forgetful about my lights and lock my doors. You sound like the world's nicest drunk."
dcmals,You would not be the asshole. It sounds like you’re family has tried to do right by her for a long time. It sounds like she needs more round the clock care at this point. Alzheimer’s is really tough as the person you once knew slips into a new volatility. I’m sorry you are having this difficulty with her.
dcmcxk,"NAH but you might want be mindful that the world can be a very small place sometimes and with the wrong person it might come back to haunt you later whether you know it or not.

Best of luck!"
dcmfhu,"NTA, your sister overreacted dramatically."
dcmgw0,"NTA

Those were food items you set aside to eat later. He doesn't eat leftovers, fine. But, he shouldn't be throwing out perfectly good food that you plan on eating. It's a waste of money, time, and resources.

It's really not even the fact that it's food. It's disrepect."
dcmix5,[deleted]
dcmlx7,"NAH. You were wrong. You were SO wrong. And I’ll get to that in a minute. But you made an honest mistake and a lapse in judgement. That doesn’t make you an asshole. Just wrong. 

You are not Bailey’s mother. You don’t get to decide what is and isn’t ok. It doesn’t matter that your boyfriend isn’t 18. Clearly Bailey’s parents were not comfortable with her playing with strangers they haven’t met. Yes, you know him and will vouch for him, but they don’t know him. They have 100% say over who their child sees. 

You were fired for your lapse in judgement. The mother feels she can no longer trust your decision making in regards to her child. That is her right as Bailey’s mother. It does not make her an asshole. Take this as a learning experience and move on."
dcmpdr,ESH - you should have taken a bit of time to just get into the game. You could say you just weren't into them but you appreciated that she was a big fan. She shouldn't have taken the games back but probably felt that her present wasn't being appreciated.
dcmphu,"A bunch of drunkards at 00.30 on a weekday, I think it's pretty sensible not to involve yourself"
dcmpk5,"NAH 

But a bigger issue here is that lights on for a long period of time waste electricity and heat up too much, causing a fire hazard. Perhaps she is more worried about these things and is using sleep as an excuse?"
dcmppu,YTA - you're either in the relationship or your not. You can't get upset if you are wishy washy about the relationship and she decides to cut you out. Shit or get off the pot.
dcmqm9,"NTA. With MILs like this, the best time to reveal your pregnancy is at your kid’s college graduation. But seriously, create some ironclad boundaries right now, for any jerks in your orbit. Best of luck for an easy delivery and a happy and healthy baby!"
dcmryx,"YTA. I have similar issues. I very nearly start crying if I can hear someone slurping, swallowing, chewing, or breathing heavily while they eat... but you’ve GOT to realize it’s a you problem and not an everyone else problem. You make people feel called out and embarrassed when they haven’t actually done anything wrong. I understand that it’s awful. Believe me, I do. It’s okay to talk to people you’re close to about it IN PRIVATE, but please stop calling people out in front of others and please don’t call out strangers or casual acquaintances. I get it. It’s physically painful. It really is.

Funny story: as much as I hate all those other eating noises, I’m a tooth scraper. This really bothers one of my friends and I’ve become more aware since, trying to make a point not to do it in case anyone around me might be bothered... but most of the time it’s not conscious. It’s a habit I’ve had probably since I started using a fork almost three decades ago, and that’s the hardest kind of habit to break."
dcmv55,"Your father is making broad negative generalizations based on race. That's classic racism.

dcn4x0,"NTA - he could see you were in the middle of a load and should've waited his turn. It's a hostel not the Mandarin Oriental.

dcn7h8,NTA. You gave her time to decide. You let her stay for limited time. She wanted to abuse your good willing and made a deal behind your back with S without even consulting you. They are both a-holes here.
dcn8qm,"NTA.

You are essentially dognapping, so I think this is a case where you would technically be in the wrong. But you would be 100% NTA. I'm sure priorities and pet owner values are different across Mexico, there are many parts of the world where pet care is not seen as important. But to me, a dog is a dog, and it sounds like these dogs are neglected and suffering. Morally, domesticated animals that don't have a choice in where and how they live should be taken care of to the best of their ability by the humans that own them.

Why aren't you asking the owner?"
dcnbxk,"NTA - I'd even change the wifi name to ""buy your own wifi"" or something but I'm petty like that"
dcnf4l,"NTA.

She sounds entitled and I'd be annoyed too if I did things for another family member and the one time I needed something simple done, they couldn't be bothered (even after 3 days). You can't expect people to cater to your needs/wants whenever you need them to if you aren't willing to reciprocate, especially when you're, I'm assuming, atleast 18. It doesn't matter that she's your best friend, she's being an AH."

dcnihm,"NTA as someone young and on the spectrum I wouldn't want to hang out with someone double my age. Its awkward and weird if you the only thing you have in common is autism. Not to mention as someone with autism, would he really want to be forced to hang out with someone new for this specific reason?"
dcniyj,"NTA. Please OP, listen to me. I’ve gone through your profile and saw your other posts about her. She’s not worth it. For the sake of yourself, please try to disconnect from her immediately. I can not control your life, and I rarely comment on these posts. 

But she is shitting all over you and you’re not doing anything about it. Leave her, and in a couple months you will not have to be worrying about this stuff. I cannot let someone else get shit on by a girl they’ve been dating for 5 months, or any girl in general. 

Please man, I genuinely feel bad for you. This girl doesn’t respect you, and I’m sure there is a strong bond between you guys, but you are not important to her. I’m sorry to say it but come on man, the facts are right in front of you. PMs open if you need to talk."
