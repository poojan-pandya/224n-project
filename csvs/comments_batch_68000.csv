dbx07q,"NTA. Your response is perfect. Stay the course until this generation is done. 

I once brought a friend home for Xmas when my mom was dating a cool guy with family of these people, his mom especially. He introduced himself and explained that since he couldn't fly back home to California, he was staying with me who he considered his ""New York family"" cue awwww. 2 sentences later Karen asks him how Christmas is celebrated in his culture.

Face-palm.

He took it in such stride, and answered ""Everything is pretty much the same in California except no snow! Glad to have snow this year.""

Stay classy, a bad reaction will only reflect on you."
dbx0gl,"NTA.  That kind of ex can mine your friends for information about you.  That affects your safety.  Even without the social implications, that alone is reason to cut ties."
dbx6op,she caught wild mice... to rerelease into the wild... somewhere else ?
dbx75g,"NTA. As a guest, I wouldn't expect a vegetarian host to cook meat. It wouldn't even cross my mind as a possibility."
dbx8p6,ESH. This behaviour on both sides is inappropriate for the workplace.
dbxg39,"YWBTA if you don't delete the picture, IMO. If this person is really your friend, I don't think it should be that big a deal for you to take the pic down--is it really any skin off your nose, especially since it seems to bother your friend?"
dbxgsd,"A couple of notes I thought I'd share:

I was a psych/biochemistry major in college, now in psychiatric drug research (PhD student studying psychiatric drug development). I'm not a clinician but based on what you shared he definitely doesn't need a second opinion. These are all super common symptoms, combined with the fact that he received a diagnosis from a psychiatrist who would be able to tell very easily (the tests/determinations for schizophrenia have very high validity and reliability). Secondly, based on what i've learned not only from taking classes but talking to clinicians, the scariest symptom a person can have is **command hallucinations**, which is, as it sounds, any sort of sensory perception (typically auditory in the form of voices) telling a person to do something. The reason why these are scary is because people usually act upon them, they tend to escalate, and the person truly believes they have to do what the voices say. A lot of high profile acts of violence (ex: Reagan's attempted assassination) are the result of command hallucinations. Schizophrenia is also degenerative, leading to worsening of the condition as it progresses. Schizophrenic patients lose brain volume, which can have an array of adverse effects. So while he may now be sweet and non-violent, this may change, and he's already ""compromised"" in the sense that he's suffering from these hallucinations already.

Based on this super long-winded basis, I would say you're definitely NTA and your BIL needs help. Your fear that he could turn violent without warning is very realistic given his symptoms, especially if he continues to not get treatment (although it sounds like his family is taking the steps to get him help)."
dbxhru,YTA - and I definitely get why your boyfriend is upset. You just proved you can be bought.
dbxklx,"NTA - accidents happen and the guy overreacted.

You asked him to stop because he was scaring you - shouldn't that make think hard about your relationship?"
dbxknp,"NAH, but oh my god do not let her go to the Philippines for a medical procedure just because it’s cheaper or quicker. Look up botched Philippines breast implants. That shit is unbelievably dangerous."
dbxwzx,"NTA.

She is derailing the game and not taking your setting seriously by trying to be a murder hobo. DnD is a communal game, meaningful decisions should be made by the players in response to situations setup by the GM. The GM curates the experience and the players engage with it in good faith.

As someone who has run a few games, here is an option to consider - let her act out in game and have the guards handle it."
dbxzhr,NTA.  Anyone who jams their hands in my face to ask for something is most definitely *not* getting anything.  They were rude to think that’s how you do things.  You were clearly being generous and if they’d simply asked nicely like a normal person they probably would have gotten some.

If you are splitting the bill, any savings promotion on that bill belongs to all of you.  As you said, there was probably a Samsung speaker or other electronics that everyone could have enjoyed.  If not, it would at least need to be discussed who gets what."

Yall suck because it's his birthday and listening to seone play piano is super boring for most people (source: I play the piano )"
dbyd9z,"NTA, you can't help someone who doesn't want help.  It's not your business.  If she seeks you out, that's a different story."
dbyf99,"YWNBTA

It's possible she doesn't understand how weird/creepy this is. Let her know that this makes you uncomfortable, but don't accuse her of being controlling. It's possible she's just being overly excited about this shiny new toy and isn't thinking about how it's making you feel."
dbyjta,"YTA stop trying to get a deal. The mom is the main landlord , accept the rent or find somewhere else"
dbymmj,"NTA- As long as you are respectful, you should definitely bring this up. She's young an inexperienced, but should know better than to blast alarms in a shared space for that long."
dbytnn,"NTA, you weren't being deceptive, he's just being manipulative."
dbytxn,YTA. You don’t get to go to parties for people who don’t like you.
dbyv8z,NTA but that was kinda confusing to follow. If I understood it right you’re NTA and should now worry about them
dbz0sh,NTA!  Do not say a thing to M.  You know this only as it pertains to your job.  If you share confidential information such as this you can get wrote up.  Show your boss they can trust you.
dbz1xt,NTA - if you don’t want him over you don’t have to
dbz3ke,"Uggggghhh, no NTA. What your boyfriend is saying is that he thought you’d be more comfortable letting him control you by now. You’re doing nothing wrong at all."
dbz75n,NTA - Ask and you shall receive. Not like you warned them before or they have to use it.
dbz95m,"YTA. What the fuck man? You actually have no idea if he went through the proper channels. What purpose did it serve to warn Aaron? You gave him a heads up and not Blake that his boss was suspicious of him? He may have acted pompously, but everyone deserves to work in a safe and professional environment. You may have tipped off the boss enough that the company can skate by an investigation and then return to not giving a fuck afterwards."
dbzckv,"LOL... pop out a cube next time he gets dismissive and solve it in 30 seconds, then have him try. Getting embarrassed in front of girls at parties a few times after opening his mouth about how it's not a big deal should shut him up. NTA"
dbzido,"A lot of people here probably aren't going to understand what a finsta is, fair warning.

I don't think you're a bad person for venting about a relationship, but you also have to accept that all social media is technically public once you allow anyone but yourself to enter a space. Anyone can leak it at any time. 

NAH, she has a right to be upset but if anyone goes and talks to her then they can make their own judgment. Hell, my current boyfriend of a year was talked about on his ex's finsta and he isn't a bad guy to me now that I actually heard both sides of the story."
dbziyn,"Bills are split by roommates, theoretical bills are not.  If you're making a personal profit off your bill split, something isn't even now is it?

dbzk34,"YTA

He was being good enough to provide you with the account that was really important to you and you kind of disregarded and disrespected him in return. Then you were shocked... SHOCKED... that he took back the toys you were borrowing from him in order to disrespect him."

IF there is a fire, they’ll destroy her car to access the hydrant, so you might be doing her a favor. 

Plus f*ck ppl who block emergency service stuff.

Edit: grammar"
dbzqdz,"YTA. It was her home and her mother. Being “tired of hearing it” is a selfish reason for telling her to stop.

I speak Spanish and English. My SO speaks Arabic and English. His Mother speaks Dutch and English. My daughter is learning Spanish and my son is learning German. Of course there will be conversation that not everyone will understand. That’s modern life."
dbzrcg,"NTA. It doesn't sound like you're joining the military to avoid having to care for your father it sounds like you're joining the military for unrelated reasons and are going to not be able to care for your father because you are in the military oh, and frankly you might be able to do more to help your father financially or what not if you had a stable career rather than if you were the actual caretaker"
dbzyqg,"NAH, he doesn’t owe you to tell you about something he is doing to his own body, but at the same time I understand why it would be nice to just let you know beforehand."
dc0229,NTA. Your uncle is a greedy dick. This sounds like a bad movie plot tbh
dc0325,"NTA.  Even without the story of your coworker being a jerk.  It is YOUR chair.  It doesn't matter if you use it to hold files between uses.  It is the companies obligation to purchase a chair and if he can't wait until they have the money, he should invest in his own or bring one from home."
dc0cef,"By 'serve your nation', do you mean join the army?
Because you're TA for thinking he should be forced to do that. That law is bullshit.
But you're NTA for criticising your friend for being lazy.
As a gamer myself, I get the appeal of them.
But he's a grown man and needs to prove he can act like it if he wants to go overseas"
dc0dei,YTA. If your brother knew the price from the start he would pay half of it. You don't deserve the 90%. It's 50/50. Don't be a selfish asshole.
dc0e7s,"NTA, BECAUSE, she said that the truth needed to be said to someone all the while insulting her daughter, which like you said isnt the way to go about things. I will admit though, it's kinda petty, lol."
dc0f8u,"NTA - Dude, grow a spine! A valid answer is no. In the case of the Uncle, asking for a specific date is not out of bounds. Don't get bullied."
dc0gd0,"YTA for agreeing to this method of repayment. If you didn’t want this, you shouldn’t have taken the money. Finish your work, fill out the form, and move on."
dc0k7n,"YTA

I love traveling, and I often run off during the holidays. My SO and I often travel without each other, and don't believe partners need to be on every trip.

 But THREE years in a row you do this to your girlfriend for both Christmas and New Years?? 

Holy smokes. When will special occasions with her become a priority? I'd be more than pissed. Ya, you're at a point you're totally committed to the trip, so too late. But spending the holidays with your girlfriend three years into a relationship should have been a consideration well before now. 

Year one I get. Year two, I'd be hurt. Year three I'd start weighing whether I could rely on my partner to actually prioritize me, and probably start planning my exit strategy."

dc0r0r,"YTA.  


Preston is an annoying jerk.  I have no quibble with that.  


You don't like Preston. I have no quibble with that.  


But you literally invited everybody else in your class but him.  


Your ability to throw parties rests solely on being lucky enough to have parents who let you do it.    


You're a lucky kid. And you used this advantage to basically bully Preston.  


He wasn't asking to come in and be your first gay kiss.  He just didn't want to be excluded from an event that literally everyone else in his grade was attending.  


You did a lot of harm.  You achieved no good. That was a jerk move. Preston may be a complete douche, but unless he was going to ruin your party, you didn't need to exclude him.  


You CHOSE to exclude him. Yes, you CAN do that. But not-being an asshole is a higher bar than that.  We CAN do anything that's not explicitly illegal  


And being emtionally cruel to people isn't usually illegal.  The law won't stop you. Only your basic human decency can do that.  


There's a huge difference betwen ""legally within my rights"" and being a good person."
dc0sjt,"NTA. You've made several requests that she's ignored, and she's taking advantage of you doing her a favor. Give her 2 weeks to get out and stick to it. 

Don't bring up her finances though, that's none of your business. 

&#x200B;

>She also seems to have a habit of making subtle digs towards me that stick with me and upset me a little. For example, she called me a bipolar bitch when I was having a down day and belittled the fact I went to the doctor to get medication.

I don't know if ""subtle"" means what you think it means."
dc10zk,"NTA. I cut off contact with my mother when I was just a little older than you, and it was the best decision I ever made. I'm happier, less anxious, less stressed and healthier.

It sounds like your mom has major problems. But you can't fix her, and you aren't obligated to go down with that ship.

I would suggest trying to calmly explain to her that her issues have taken too much of a toll on you. For now, you need her to respect your space and not call or email. In the future, if she works on getting her life together, you may reinitiate contact, but one way or another, it won't be any time soon.

Sorry you're going through this, and best of luck."
dc17oo,"NAH. I'm going to go out on a limb and say maybe your mom is going through some stuff and she was embarrassed or ashamed there was no food and so she took it out on you. Not saying she is justified in that at all, just saying that maybe your mom has a lot going on right now. I'm sorry that she took away your electronics and gave you a lot of chores--that seems pretty unreasonable. But maybe if you talk to her later, after she has time to think about everything, she'll ease up on you. You sound like a good kid. Hang in there. :)"
dc19gv,YTA - She's your plaything and your are old enough to understand you are wasting a portion of her life. You should just breakup now.
dc1ap1,"NTA.  If she's having trouble making rent or can't afford to go out, she can't go out.  It's a shame, but you should definitely still go.  Definitely take your mom!"
dc1bo9,"YTA, not trusting your own brother, kicking his girlfriend out when you don't even live there anymore and

dc1e2u,"ESH

You are a kid. You haven't learned yet how to deal with testy situations, but you have YEARS to learn. :)

Next time someone, ANYONE, says anything to you while you are in the middle of doing something, say ""hi! gimme a minute to settle myself here"" regardless of what the other person has said to you. Just ignore ALL of it and only acknowledge that you see them.

Once you have taken a moment to hang up the phone, finish dealing with your umbrella, straightening up your clothing, whatever, turn to the person and say something like ""hi! all settled now"" and either let them repeat what they said, or ask them how their day is/went/what they need, etc., depending on the situation.

This allows both them AND you a moment to catch a breath before either of you say something that can cause a situation to blow up like this one did. 

Relationships of ALL types will move in and out of your life. You cannot, and never will be, able to control how someone else acts or what they say, but you CAN control how you act and what you say. 

It is ALWAYS better to take a moment for yourself before you say something."
dc1fkl,"NTA. A big ole ""fuck that"" to what she's demanding. Even if you had agreed to drive her every day to wherever her heart desired, you still would have always had the option to change your mind. Stick to your own commute that works best for you."

If I were you? I’d air it publicly on the discord or social media. “I’m being threatened with being kicked from this tournament because I blocked a staff member who attacked me, here’s the receipts.”

I’m not sure if you want to go that route, but public pressure might change their tune imho

EDIT: just reread the bit about feminine people. 

Yeah for sure air this publicly. They are enabling an abuser. This dude is red flags city and this should NOT be his position."
dc1iy0,"NTA, but I hate to break it to you but if what you wrote is true you’ve gotten caught up In a very unfortunate and unhealthy marriage dynamic that you need to address with your wife."
dc1siy,"YTA. You invited him along. It’s pretty rude, even though you warned him in advance, to say “we will pay for everyone but you”. That’s pretty goddamn rude."
dc1wch,"NAH, but they probably felt like you didn't trust them or thought they would ridicule you and that hurt they're feelings. Just explain you were trying to avoid making a fuss."
dc1wf9,"NTA, but you need to move on. Talk to someone who DOES want to hang out with you."
dc1wql,"NTA. This is just petty high school drama that will get left in the dust when college arrives. If they can’t handle you meeting new people and making new friends they aren’t worth your time 5-10 years from now lol

dc21ns,"My guess is YTA.  If at 20 you already have friends or loved ones complaining about your behavior while drinking you might want to look into that.  You seem awfully keen to prove you ""don't act bad"" when you drink.  That's generally a red flag."
dc225l,"I can understand being frustrated at having to move all the time, but I have to say it sounds like your dad really loves you and is trying his hardest to make you more comfortable at his house; he didn't just shell out money (which is easy if you have it), some of your list items meant he had to have some conversations with his wife and stepkids about their behavior around you, and people typically don't like having those kinds of talks, so for him to willingly do it because you asked it of him speaks volumes as to how much he wants you around. I hope your visits get easier to deal with soon."
dc250o,"NTA. But as a WC adjuster, I wouldn’t be able to terminate any of his benefits unless there was video proof. But letting them know is how they will know to hire a detective to follow and record him."
dc2e93,"NTA. Nicu nurse here. Having a micropreemie in the nicu is very stressful for families, and you need to do what you can to help with that. If that means your SIL doesn't visit unless you are present, then that's what you should do. Hubby needs to support you in this."
dc2ebz,"NAH- You can't have your older dog being attacked on a regular basis; that's not fair to that dog. I'm sure the pit mix is  quite upset that your ex is gone, and it sounds like he requires more attention/supervision than you are able to provide (not a judgement call against OP by any means, I promise!). Since your home seems to no longer be a good fit for the pit mix, the best thing would be to re-home him. Just make sure it's really a good fit before you let him go!

I am a bit curious about the decision to get a cat after re-homing the dog. If you are getting rid of the pit mix *specifically* so that you can get a cat, then that would make you TA. However, If you are getting rid of the pit mix because of the attacks on the older dog, and because he requires more one-on-one time than you can provide, that's a different story altogether in which there are NAH."
dc2efk,"NTA- buuuut

Don't ever tell her. Just get them back and burn them and when she asks where they are just say you have no idea. Seriously I'm saving you right now"
dc2eme,I'd say something again. Because ya 3 times over 2 years is nothing. They probably don't even remember you saying anything. I'd just go to them and be like hey the smell has been really bothering me is there anyway you xan smoke outside?

dc2i2s,"NTA.  


If she doesn't remember saying it, the decent thing to say is, ""I honestly do not remember ever saying that.  However you seem very sure that I did.  I don't agree with that sentiment, now. And I'm very, very sorry that you suffered because of this.  I don't remember saying this, but if you say I did? I'm sorry and please understand that I don't believe this, now.""  


anything short of that? she's being a stubborn asshole. At BEST.  


At worst, this still reflects how she feels."
dc2jei,NTA. Would have been nice if he had just offered you the $10 for a beer or lunch to get lost though. Why go to the trouble of potentially hurting your feelings by going behind your back? I'd be a little pissed tbh.
dc2jqm,"I understand that. I wouldn't have made them fettuccine alfredo because that is obviously unhealthy. There was no mention of ""I can't have any mayo in my diet"", and maybe I'm wrong but I figured a tunfish sandwhich, tomato soup, and whole grain chips would be considered a ""healthy"" meal compared to the vast majority of food that college kids eat."
dc2jqq,"ESH. He has an addiction and shouldn't be lying to you about it. But you've known he's been a smoker for 9 years. It's foolish of you to think that you can change him/end his addiction just by making him promise not to smoke.

He'll quit for good when he's ready. In the meantime, you need to decide if you want to date a smoker or not."
dc2kg9,"NTA. 

You were followed home by a stranger who threatened to trespass in your yard. You told them clearly that they were not permitted to do such a thing. They did it anyways stating clearly that they didn't care. 

It might be a child, but the child clearly knew they were in the wrong. You do not have to be nice to someone who trespasses and refuses to leave."
dc2nzt,"NTA- I mean a white lie would have been preferable, but it sounds like you were painted into a corner by already telling her the place was free? I think you were truthful, albeit direct."
dc2poa,"Lol. NTA. 

You went to stay with your father's side of the family who haven't been in contact with you since you were 4 under the assumption that they wanted to know you now. 

They did not try to make you feel comfortable in their home. Instead they did the exact opposite. 

Your autism doesn't matter here. A lot of the things they have done go against what normal levels of hospitality should be in such a situation. They acted poorly even without taking into account your sensory issues and social anxiety and whatnot. 

Your behaviour, from what you have described, is also not abnormal and should not be expected to have been different. To be thirst into a situation like this is a totally different state with a bunch of strangers is incredibly difficult for anyone. Even a neurotypical adult would have a hard time. For a family trying to get to know you the focus should have been on making you feel more socially comfortable. Any issues they had with your phobias or sensory processing or whatnot should have been left for another time, and should have been addressed with your mum not you. 

It sounds like that side of your family is a side you're better off not knowing."
dc2rg6,"YTA for not just having two flower girls. Like, why was this even an issue in the first place?"
dc2rl9,NTA - For just 3 days with a bunch of people you don't know it's not worth it. I'm getting sick of these expensive hen dos brides are throwing but also don't want to spend any of their own money on. You can go on a week long holiday of your choice with that money.

It’s one thing for the child to just be existing at home, yes there might be some screaming, he might jump off of stuff and his the ground hard...but I don’t think it’s okay for the kid to make a habit of pounding on walls.

Either you talk to the parents kindly about it, and also be understanding that it would mean they have to do more parenting than they are used to doing, or try talking to the land lord about it."

dc3lto,"NTA - They offered the holiday as a gift, and the fact that he pays for your step mother's children while she doesn't do the same for you is unfair"
dc3lu4,"YTA, but not because what you did was offensive, which is why I suspect you think you're the asshole. Offending someone or being offensive does not automatically make you an asshole - context matters.

You put yourself in a position where you either had to lie or eat a serious penalty to your grade. By getting shitfaced *the day before an important presentation*, you put yourself in a position to where you had to sell your integrity to avoid the consequences of getting shitfaced.

THAT'S why you're the asshole. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't that big of a deal. But this kind of thing gets people in very real trouble all the time. Never put yourself in a position to where you either have to lie or accept an unacceptable penalty."

>I find that's a pretty inappropriate relationship to begin with.

That's NORMAL. They're what, 1-1.5 years apart? Jeez. 



>brags all the time about how pretty she is, and probably says 2-3 times a day to me and my husband about how much he loves her

He's a teenager. Hormones are a thing. Puppy love is a thing. Chill. 




>it feels like he's rubbing it in my face that he cares about someone else and not me

This is just...strange. It's time to cut the cord, lady. Accept that you won't be the only female I'm his life from here on out. 



>I'm afraid that this is going to lead to them having sex,

Now here, I agree he's too young. But I'd start mentally preparing NOW because one day sooner than later he will have sex. 



>his grades dropping.

Do the parenting thing and set boundaries and make rules. If he wants to see her and his friends, he's gotta maintain his grades. 



>He acts like I am the devil, because I don't necessarily approve of her and I've made this known.

It's fucking bizarre how you act and feel towards this CHILD. Like...what. This whole post really just seems like you need to accept that your baby boy is growing up. 

Friendly advice. The more resistance you show towards your teenager about things you dont approve of, the more they'll actually do whatever you're against AND do it behind your back. I'm not surprised he acts like you're the devil considering how you already hate his first girlfriend and how you react towards her."
dc3w4v,"NAH. He tried to do something nice, doesn't sound like he intended to trick you or lie about the eggs. But it's also not your fault that you can't stomach eggs. Just a poor misunderstanding!"

dc5fj4,"I’m not going to judge whether you would be the asshole or not, but I am going to share my story. 

I’m a gay guy, and my grandmother died 18 years ago. We were very close. I spent time at her house once a week, and would stay with her for a week or two each summer. When she was dying, and went on hospice, instead of hiring help, my parents and I took shifts and gave her 24 hour care. In that time we grew much closer, and my grandmother showed me a softer side of her I had never seen before. It was clear she was mentally getting herself ready to die. 

One night in one of her last few weeks, when she was only awake a couple hours a day, she asked me if I like girls. I honestly wasn’t entirely sure what she meant, so I asked. She told me that she wanted to know if I liked boys or girls—because she didn’t mind if I liked boys, except she knows how cruel the world can be, and how people who are different often get treated, and how sad that made her. And she hoped that I like girls, for the sole fact that life was hard enough without having something make it harder. 

I might never forget the tone of her voice as she said, “I know how they get treated...it’s so sad.”

I wasn’t sure what to tell her. But I felt that she was really asking to know that I would be okay when she was gone. And even though I knew she was right, and that being gay would make life harder for me, I also knew that I would be okay. 

So it seemed like the most compassionate thing for her, and also for me in that moment, to tell her that I like girls. I didn’t have to tell her that I was going to date them, or marry them. Even if not in the way I knew she meant, I do like girls. 

I don’t regret choosing not to come out to her. Is the fact that I’m gay central to my relationship with her? No. It was much more important that she loved me and wanted the best for me.  It was much more important that in that moment I was able to offer her some inner peace the way she had so often taken care of me. 

I think the question isn’t whether you would be an asshole not. I think the question is which relationship would be hurt more, and which relationship would recover more easily? Your relationship with yourself if you don’t tell her? Or your relationship with her if you do tell her?

If not telling her would be a burden you have to carry, maybe you should. It wasn’t for me. Maybe you could let go of the idea that she should know. 

But it’s also possible that telling her would cause strife that becomes its own heavy burden. 

If you want to get married and have children, you can focus on that part without saying or even agreeing that it would be a woman you marry and parent with. There are ways to reply tactfully without outrightly lying. 

It’s for you to decide if you should tell her or not. But get clear on why you’d be telling her. Or get clear on why you may choose not to tell her. Both courses of action have their cost. But the clearer you are on why you chose one over the other, the more easily you can reconcile the effects of your actions on everyone involved."
dc5jo9,"YTA for ghosting someone you say is your best friend. It's very possible for two people who communicate well not to have arguments (which I define as yelling, screaming, leaving the house, hurt feelings, etc. You didn't go into detail about your interactions with SO so I might be projecting my own interpretation. Take with a grain of salt). I've been married for almost that same time period and we have yet to argue in any way that makes me so mad I want to text someone and vent about him. We don't always see eye to eye, but we talk about it and communicate how we're feeling, why that is, discuss that it's possible there's no rational reason for this but it doesn't change the feeling, say what we need from the other to feel better or do better... point being, not all couples ""argue."" 

She may be sugar coating things, she may be really good at communicating, or she may just not want to air her dirty laundry with you. But if she's your best friend, you should communicate how you feel and be willing to be vulnerable."

dc5r3j,"A lot of my friendships have ended without formal explanations. If things can peacefully fizzle out that's fine.

dc5tr3,"YTA.

> Am I really obligated to take of her loans?

No, you're not. It's technically your money. But you're still an asshole if you don't help her out even a little bit.

This is your wife. The love of your life. The woman you ostensibly want to spend the rest of your life with. By your own admission, she is struggling with an issue that has taken hold of her life. And you really don't want to give, I repeat, your OWN WIFE a single penny towards fixing that? In my opinion, that is indicative of an asshole.

Let me put it this way. Why should you set aside any money for your child? It's your money. What's that? You love them and want to meet needs for them that they can't meet themselves? Huh, what a novel concept.

EDIT: To be clear, I'm not advocating for you to pay off these loans in their entirety. IMO, you not wanting to pay for ANY of them is the primary issue here."
dc5vj1,"YTA

Let me see if I can summarize:

It seems like the root issue was that you were asked to be home at a certain time and said you would... then decided to go do whatever you felt like at the time you said you would be home. Your Dad didn't appreciate his request being disregarded and you lying to him, but for some reason was still cool with your boyfriend staying the night. For some reason I can't understand your boyfriend is really pissed off at this point... apparently he really want to go to the movies or bowling or something? 

You then proceed to ignore your parents completely after all this and they call around to your boyfriends parents looking for you. You feel this is some sort of betrayal instead of normal behavior for parents who's kid has already lied to them once about coming home after they said they would that night, but you know it will anger your easily angered boyfriend, so you don't tell him. Your father then calls him and that is how he finds out that you are actually at home. 

Your boyfriend is really angry (I really don't get this guy) so he gets his parents to come pick him up and while your outside you get a message that your dad wants to talk. You refuse to talk to your father still. Your father is strangely angered after you lied to him multiple times and then didn't even let him know you were home after he let your angry boyfriend  stay the night. You get pissed that he is pissed and say you will run away. Your boyfriends parents you talk you out of it. 

&#x200B;

Did I get that right? Because in how I am reading it you were a jerk to your father all night and pretty much everything he did seems reasonable. Seriously, how do you think someone should react to you lying to them a bunch?

I also really don't get your boyfriend who seems just mad all the time but for no reason... he can be the asshole too then.

This really doesn't read like you guys are adults. The rules being set on you don't make sense for an adult. The way you respond and treat other people doesn't sound like an adult... pretty much this whole thing makes way more sense (other than letting your boyfriend stay the night) if you were 14."
dc5vne,"YTA if you ""**confront""** her. If you're genuinely interested in repairing the relationship then you need to have a calm and rational talk with her.

If you really think you cant go back to being friends then just leave things as it is. I doubt you'll get an apology if you confront her."
dc5w3m,"I'll go with NTA, but I don't think you should call her out on that post. What's the point? She likely won't apologize anyway.

To be honest, I don't think you should call her a friend in the first place. She seems extremely self-interested, and toxic AF."
dc5wuy,NTA--He didn't keep his word. He has no integrity. This doesn't mean you have to cut him out of your life just don't do business with him anymore.

So here is the thing with kids... you have to make the choices that will be best for them not what will make them happiest in the moment. 

Saying that you don't want an alcoholic who is active in their disease to be around kids... seems pretty reasonable. 

That said, hate the disease not the person. If she can show she is sober again then give her a chance again... not ""all is forgiven"" though, have good boundaries and she has to earn trust back on your terms. Your job is to protect those kids from her so that if she does come back into their lives it will be in a positive way."
dc62ng,NTA in my opinion. We all have preferences and we can’t help that. More like your friend is the asshole for making a deal out of something so insignificant to begin with.

dc6n2x,"It wasn't intentional on your part, but YTA. 

**it's been one week** His being upset over being single isn't an indication he needs a new gf and that will fix everything, it means he's still processing the breakup. (very normal. it's been **one week!**) For your first option/contact to be setting him up on a  date is... incredibly tone deaf. Particularly to have the date offer come from you, the person he's getting over. 

If you really wanted to go down this path, it should have been a friend mutual to both of them (who is not you) setting it up or even her asking him herself. you should have been as out of it as humanly possible."

It's also odd to do this as a joint fund. Shouldn't each couple just buy their stuff for dinner and the ""food fund"" be for various shared items like bread and milk ect? otherwise you run into people having budgeting conflicts, particularly with different wealth levels. 


**However** do keep in mind that a fair chunk of socialising revolves around mealtimes, you guys may be missing out on that by not contributing a couple days. Consider offering to do takeout days, cook very simple and easy meals, ect at least a couple times, and ideally put in enough money so that your portions of dinner will be covered should you choose to join them on occasion or eat some of the leftover for lunch (or just chuck them some money each time. more than enough money is better.)"

Before you do that, though, there are things you can do to try to help the dog improve. Look up videos and guides online about dog training, or hire a trainer to help with her behavioural issues. All you've written can actually be tackled pretty easy with training and a little consistency. The barking at guests, the dog aggression. You can fix the issues and help your dog be happier, because aggression in dogs is often just a response to fear, stress and anxiety. She sounds like a lovely animal, and it would be a really big shame for her to be separated from you when you're clearly her safe space. Talk to your partner about putting the work in to get her trained so that both parties are happy and the dog can stay."

Growing up with a brother of my own, my parents were always careful to ensure neither of us were treated better or worse than the other. If one of us was given x amount of money, then so would the other.

eg. While at university, our mother gave us each £150 a month to cover living expenses that then dropped to £100 a month once we had a job.

It sounds like your parents might be unconsciously playing favourites but I could be wrong. Maybe they see the covering of your medication as a fair exchange but I would  say that since it is essential for you that that is not fair."

I think we need to take into consideration what our peers say about our behavior. In some countries, sharing a table at dinner is normal and refusing to let someone sit is the height of rude. In other societies, sitting down at a table with a stranger is considered pushy and awkward. Certain behavior, in isolation, is not rude or wrong by itself--it depends entirely on how our peers view them. 

So if your peers are telling you that this costume is likely to be considered rude, then you run the risk of being seen as an asshole. The show itself is pretty cool and I think the costume sounds interesting. I just think you have to take into consideration whether you want the fallout from wearing a costume your peers find offensive or that might hurt someone who survived that disaster. 

There is also a small risk of things like this getting out of control if people truly are feeling social media trigger happy. Not saying it will happen, but the only reason you would be an asshole is because your peer group says you are."

Instead of trying to understand her feelings, your response to her is to *cut down on the time she gets to see her dad* (are you kidding me? The fact that he’d even allow this says a lot about him as a parent, too), in order to prioritize your potential new baby.

Please allow me to explain. 

I’m a mom of 14yo twin boys. Both are on the autism spectrum and have other sorts of mental health issues. They were born early after a very risky pregnancy. One of my sons is a bit further on the spectrum which has actually resulted in a very confident and intelligent dude. His twin, however, had seriously obnoxious behaviors tied to some of his issues. We tried everything to help this kid. We live in Massachusetts and our school system is fricking awesome. We are so lucky to live here. 

Years of IEPS, therapy, paraprofessionals, you name it didn’t work nearly as well as having one kid in his class stand up to him and really fucking tell him to knock his shit off. And you know what?? 

IT

FUCKING

WORKED!!

A year later and my son has finally looked outside himself to see how his behavior was affecting others. He put it best: Not everyone knows their the bully. 

I would like to gently suggest that you speak to a guidance counselor about what happened. This way, if he needs some support at home he can get it. That’s his parents’ job... not yours. Peace."

People say lots of stuff they don't mean when they are in pain and under stress. However that doesn't lessen the way you feel. Self advocating is important especially when you are a care taker. This is a stressful time for your mom being hospitalized. And food is one of the few things they have a choice over and let me tell you its patients most complained about topic. When people are in the hospital they have so little control over what's going on that they try to control whatever they can, in this case its berating family and the food. This is NORMAL. Take a breathe and even a day or two and reach back out. Hopefully the distance and time will allow both of you to get back into communication.  

I have been working in the medical field for 9 years.  First bedside as a medic and now I work in management. Self care is important. And she's acting the way a lot of terminal patients act. Don't sweat it you are handling this right :)"

You can search for and book the exact flight you want on southwest.com and then you can also cancel/change it later at the click fo a button. There's no need for a travel agent.

That said, I have never booked a hotel through an airline and I'm not sure it's ever advantageous for you to do that. All they do is route you through their own in house travel agency.  If you use your friend to book the hotels, she gets like a 10% commission. If you use southwest to book your hotels, you get nothing and she gets nothing.  I assume she will take a credit card if you book with her so again, I don't know why you would book the hotel through Southwest.

I always book hotels directly through the hotel when possible.  You usually get the best rates that way, unless your friend is offering you a discount. And some hotels give the best rooms and benefits and points  to customers who book directly and the crappiest rooms and no points and benefits to customers who book through commission-based travel agents."

Coming from someone who is in this situation, take care of yourself OP.  It’s hard. It doesn’t get easier. But it’s your family member and you love them, so this is what you do. Sometimes blowing up at them really cannot be helped, especially if they’re really being an ass that day.

dcln04,"NAH... if she asks. If she asks for your opinion on her relationship I would give an evidenced-based opinion (i.e. “remember when you made a fancy dinner and they just went out drinking instead”). From my experience people who are insecure in their relationships ask their friends if they think it’s good a lot, so there should be an opportunity. 


I had a situation with a hard headed friend that was in a horrible relationship and because I voiced my opinion without asking I almost lost her friendship. I would just keep it quiet and support her but you can try to work it in slightly (“oh they ditched you again? That seems like a pattern. How does that make you feel?”)"

Just have fun and enjoy the time you have now to perform and be on a stage and sing and enjoy life with your friends. You’re going to miss these times, and if you continue with acting/vocal performance you’ll have many many more opportunities to come. You’ll be fine, I’ve been in your shoes, and I swear life will just get better. Whatever you do, don’t talk poorly about your friend, and don’t engage with others who do.

Clearly Bailey’s parents were not comfortable with her playing with strangers they haven’t met. Yes, you know him and will vouch for him, but they don’t know him. They have 100% say over who their child sees. 

You were fired for your lapse in judgement. The mother feels she can no longer trust your decision making in regards to her child. That is her right as Bailey’s mother. It does not make her an asshole. Take this as a learning experience and move on."

I very nearly start crying if I can hear someone slurping, swallowing, chewing, or breathing heavily while they eat... but you’ve GOT to realize it’s a you problem and not an everyone else problem. You make people feel called out and embarrassed when they haven’t actually done anything wrong. I understand that it’s awful. Believe me, I do. It’s okay to talk to people you’re close to about it IN PRIVATE, but please stop calling people out in front of others and please don’t call out strangers or casual acquaintances. I get it. It’s physically painful. It really is.

Funny story: as much as I hate all those other eating noises, I’m a tooth scraper. This really bothers one of my friends and I’ve become more aware since, trying to make a point not to do it in case anyone around me might be bothered... but most of the time it’s not conscious.

If you believe the cats are being neglected then you should be doing this the legal way, so he can't just adopt more cats and abuse/neglect them too. You should be contacting the authorities if you think animal abuse is happening. There's also the significant possibility that he isn't neglecting his cats, and you just don't go over there often enough to see him spend time with them. For a while when I lived with roommates I had to shut my cat (she passed away recently) in my bedroom while I was away because my roommates would leave front door open and we lived on a busy street. I was actually accused of neglecting her (by a guest) because she had separation anxiety and hated being locked up and would whine at the door periodically. She had pet insurance, a fountain, a 7ft tall cat tree (in my room), ate Ahi Tuna and Salmon everyday, loads of toys, a litter robot and a bunch of other stuff."

dcse87,NTA. having autism doesn’t excuse racist/bad behavior being called out
dcsecn,"~~E S H.~~ Your BIL sucks for all of the shit he pulls but do you normally leave your drug paraphernalia out where anyone can see it, including potentially your child? 

Also you say you're only high when you're ""not responsible"" for your son but what's your plan if the school calls you about an issue when you're tripping? What if your son is home earlier than you expected and you're unable to care for him? What if someone calls child services and they find you high on shrooms?

I think the problem here is that if you're the only parent and you don't want your sister and her husband to help raise your son then you are never NOT responsible for your son any more.

**EDIT**: Given OP has edited his post it's only fair to readress the situation. Based on how OP takes their recreational drugs I don't think it's much of a problem. I'd still be cautious of the snooping in-laws trying to have OP's kid taken away but given OP's precautions I suppose that's unlikely. I'm going to change my answer to **NTA** based on the edit."

dcskq7,"NTA. You’re really just doing a disservice to yourself.

dcswzz, NTA. If your mom agrees with your sister she could have loaned her the money and they both could have been “millionaires”.
dcsxk6,"YTA, although I think telling his parents was primarily your fiance's responsibility. Going around to his parents' house and ""giggling,"" saying ""well, what does it look like"" while ""flashing [your BIL] the ring"" was a very childish way of approaching something that he clearly didn't know about. 

The stuff about his mother ""PICKING UP HIS DANG PRESCRIPTIONS instead of you"" and not wanting her 25-year-old son to grow up, none of which is relevant, suggests that your resentment towards your fiance's family is what prompted you to ""forget"" to announce your engagement to them. If they ""watch LO during the day for you,"" they can't be that bad, and you're obviously comfortable making use of those services.

>this is about my fiance and I, not them..

If that was the case, why did you call your mom and your sisters?"

dctbdv,"NTA - I say this specifically because the teacher should have taken a second look at his information the first time you told him that it was incorrect rather than doubling down. A good teacher would realize that they don't have expertise in a specific field (since knowing that your blood isn't blue is pretty common knowledge) and would have done extra research to find the truth.

Frankly, I think you did a great job doing what you did. Assuming you weren't rude in your correspondence with the teacher, it's important to call people of authority out when they are wrong and it is also important to have those people then take responsibility for being wrong."
dctetr,"YTA - not for refusing to give advice anymore, but for thinking that you know better than everyone else what they should do and how they should live their lives in every situation.

dctfoz,Well you should tell her if she doesn’t start taking care of the does she’ll either need to move or rehome them. You can’t have shit and piss everywhere when you have a baby. You’re a bystander in the neglect so I would do what I said above. Or report her
dcth1c,">Edit: To be clear it's not her kid, it is her Ex's. **And the kid is no longer in the picture.** She just never mentioned she was raising a kid with her ex till now.

dcthc4,"NTA - He is ROTC and this much of a piece of shit when it comes to being on time? I'm sorry if I come across as a bit brash but fucking 'being on time' literally doesn't take any skill, just the tiniest bit of effort.

At this point I would be hard pressed not to feel like he is completely disrespecting you for failing to change his ways."

*I try to show people things that I like so that we can bond/explore that thing together, so that we can expand our relationship through that thing together*

I'm guessing if they just paid attention/watched/read they'd 'get it.'

Also, you want them to like what you do, so you can talk about it to them. If they don't, then you might have to listen to them go on about something you don't find interesting.

Accept that people have different ideas, and those ideas are not inferior, or wrong, or misguided, or because they just haven't tried tofu the way you make tofu, or the way this one restaurant makes tofu, or this one tofu restaurant. Eat your own tofu and stop pushing it on people who don't want it.

If your gf falls asleep during movies, she either just does, or she's not interested. Showing her movies you've seen so you can lead a discussion is just... so tiring. Some people don't like fucking tofu. Just deal."

Huh? What do you mean he hides? From what? He is just giving you space. 

Gotta go ESH on this one, you seem fixated on this guy. Perhaps you can explain better your beef is with him. Or is there a reason you both need to be there? Why not make this daddy/daughter event if Halloween is something y'all share and ex + boo can have an evening to themselves?

dculet,"YTA. You’re not the intentional asshole, you actually sound quite nice. But by being hyper-focused on yourself in front of a friend group, saying derogatory things about yourself, especially when others are listening that weigh more...it’s a selfish asshole move. You’re unintentionally making it “all about you”. 

Find healthier ways of coping with your negative self image, and if you need to seek professional help to deal with deeper core issues, it’s definitely out there. Many people have dealt with a similar burden. It can get better!! 

While you’re busy navigating your way through this one tip that might help is pre-plan before getting to the restaurant. They’ve got menus and nutrition info online so you’ll be set, instead of having your friends complain about it lol.

dcuoes,NTA. Decompression time is important.
dcup5y,"NTA

It's just like telling someone they have something stuck in their teeth. Its uncomfortable,  no one wants to do it but at least you can stop someone from thinking: *""Why didnt anyone tell me?""*

It's better for her to know. What she does after learning about it is up to her."
dcupju,"NTA- you don’t have to do what you don’t want to *however you also do*. If a court orders that your father look after you a certain amount of time per week/month, because you’re a minor it’s going to be that way. He will be responsible for you. If you’re not happy doing that and want to make it difficult and get courts involved they will likely side with you but there’s probably going to be a cost associated with that and someone has to pay that."
dcusgc,"YTA if you asked him to sit elsewhere without explaining. Talk to him like an adult and tell him that you would rather use the bus time as a relaxation period to read and listen to music. Most reasonable adults would have no issue with this explanation.

I don't know if this is the right angle to take since she already told you she doesn't like the music.

dcv773,NTA - she's one of his exes? She's probably just trying to cause drama between you two.
dcv9q0,"NTA - no one deserves to be abused or put in harms way. If your FIL chooses to be there, that is on him.

If he falls and needs help up, he can contact the fire department for assistance. There are ways they can help themselves without your husband doing it for them and being subjected to the abuse. He is enabling them but that is his choice at the end of the day. 

You can also put in clear boundaries - ie they are not allowed at your home without prior permission, if assisting any abusive stances will not be tolerated and you will leave immediately. You can put in whatever rules you see fit. Just make sure they are clear. 

The other thing is if the FIL mental faculties are not there, you can go after power of attorney to put him in a home. You would have to prove that the wife is incapable of caring for him but that is a discussion for a lawyer."

dcwfer,"ESH.  You didn't ask your ride to leave earlier, you *told* her she should leave earlier right when you guys were already stressed.

Your intent is fine, your delivery was poor.

During a calm time, apologize to her for snapping at her.  Then say it makes you uncomfortable to be getting there so late and having so many tardies.  Ask her how she feels about it, and genuinely listen - this will make her more open.  Then politely ask if she'd be open to leaving earlier.

Plan B - drive yourself every day, or at least in days she doesn't show up early enough."

dcxbcv,"NTA - bad businesses need to die, especially ones that are shitty to people.

dcxcnb,"NAH or NTA. Ask her why she is doing it. Is it because of time? Is it an energy/motivation thing? (ADHD and Depression for example clear off at the weirdest times). Talk to her about it. Compromise where it needs to be.

2. Checking what thing she finds annoying and agreeing to stop it/change time to do it."

They didn't like the experience initially. Go with someone who can appreciate this and one you like to go with."
dcxon9,NAH- If he wanted to spend time away from you though he would probably tell you. I've been through the same thing with my husband and he just wants to hang out with me no matter what I am doing. Are you choosing to sleep over him though? That might be a sign of something going on with you.

dcxwvp,"YTA. It’s only a month, and your parents will pay you for it. She’s doing something important for university that will help her succeed in life. Where else would she stay if you said no? I’m sure it would hurt her if her older brother said that he couldn’t do such a favor just because he didn’t feel like being around her. She’d just be staying at your house, since she has her program she probably wouldn’t even be home a lot."
dcxyuw,"NTA but if she's already going on these trips with them I think she's already ""opened up"" if you know what I mean. 

To be honest, if that's not your thing I'd cash out and let her live her that life. It's hard to change people's minds on stuff like that and an ultimatum may just be met with defiance. 

That is unless you have kids or own a home together.....then maybe you need to get creative."
dcy33b,YTA- You need to write your professor an e-mail taking responsibility for her failing the project. This was a very irresponsible and asshole way to go about getting your dream job.
dcy7yf,NTA.  The fact she replied like that says she's chosen to use her autism as an excuse not to improve behaviors she *knows* are rude.  That makes her a jerk.
dcyave,"OK this needs to be in the OP. 

You aren't TA for keeping your old text conversations. 

But it sounds like you might be TA for teasing her about liking you. Either she still likes you and you're teasing her about it, or she now sees you as a friend and you're making the situation uncomfortable. 

You're definitely TA for telling her she's your only friend. Not cool to put that much weight on anyone, even if it's true."
dcycj1,"You would not be the asshole if you asked. If you demanded, however, or failed to respect their decision if they don't choose to not go, you would be an asshole.

dcymkb,"NTA. She should grow up and learn to communicate properly. 

Buuuut also this story sounds very one-sided, I feel like the comments would be drastically different if she wrote the post. Did you refuse to pick her up unless she uses your exact words? Or did you just ask her kindly to ask but you'd pick her up anyway?"

If you give people help, and they are not appreciative, continuing to help with only lessen their respect as they will (correctly) assume that you don't have the self respect to stand up for yourself. Politely become unavailable."
dcz37r,"YTA. But only if you really are serious about your relationship. If you're not, and you need the freedom to go do your thing, then that's a different story. But man up and break up with her if that's the case. She obviously takes it seriously, and you owe her the truth."
dcz6dg,Your sister is TA because she was a bad owner who just wanted a cute kitten who didn't want the work.   You might also be TA if you let him roam around outside without being on a leash.  It's horrible for cats and the environment to just let them run wild.  They kill native animals and have a decreases life span themselves.  Indoor cats average 13 years or older where outdoor cats average around 5 years.

Don't start it assuming she's trying to screw you. Give the benefit of the doubt. It also puts her in the position of having to explicitly say she expects you to pay for all of it if that's the case. She'll likely realize that's unreasonable and not want to say it out loud so if that was the intention it will likely change."

It would drive me bananas to have someone take the liberty to move my things when it's been communicated it's not appreciated. But it would probably also bother me to have the eyesore of trash cans sitting out on the street 24/7. 

I would explain to her that you have a disability which is why you choose to keep them out there since it's difficult to manage the back and forth.

You need to stop being a pain in the ass, we are talking about meeting another person, that's it. There's no sort of expectations or commitment.

My Mom turned 60 this year and she fucks dudes that are younger than ME (turned 34 this year). Notmally when I meet them I scream they aren't my father and run out of the room sobbing to make it super weird for them. Then I come back and properly meet them.

Your Dad is trying to manipulate you into doing what he wants, which isn't cool, but frankly I don't believe you have been honest at all about how you're feeling.

I mean why do you even continue to talk to them? Because they are your Dad? That cliche is as dead and buried as your realtionship with your Father."
dd0hlt,uhhhhh.  I wouldn't so much *tell*  him what to do as *suggest.*  But in the long run you will need to evaluate whether this guy has the self-determination and discipline to be the kind of man you might want to marry.  No opinion from me on that.

While it is noble of you to consider how this would impact your children, you shouldn't be hindering your own opportunities to improve your life.  You're in a rut right now, that's a tough situation.  But it's not a permanent one.  You have the ability to pull yourself up and improve your standing in life.  If you give up your GI benefits you greatly diminish your options for how you can do that.  Even if you transfer it to your ex there is no guarantee that will improve the lives of your children.  But what it will guarantee is that your options become much more limited.  Do not be afraid to be selfish in this situation.

1. Why are you trying so damn hard to hang out with someone who doesn’t appreciate your company? If she’s flaked so much then there is no point in continuing to invite her.  Just wait until she plans something. 

2. You are not the mother of your friends, you maybe the organizer, but you are not in control of making people appear.  Let that go. 

3.  Your friends should have told you to quit inviting this person a long time ago.  Perhaps they enjoy talking about her flaking too much and refuse to set a boundary too?

4.  The flaker needs to be honest and just say she isn’t interested in hanging out with you and your group."

There was literally no need to mention you work at a high end night club and were at a college level club today other than to illustrate you think you’re better than these normies. 

And you acted that way.

dd1fbp,"YTA. From the way you describe your financial situation, this is not an insubstantial amount of money for your family that you’ve lent without any discussion with your wife. 

It’s likely a sunken cost. You won’t be in a position to demand it back, really, without poisoning the relationship. Plus they might need even more cash in the coming months, and then what?

Your wife is probably a bit upset about all that but mostly upset you (1) made an important decision about your shared finances without consulting her and (2) got into a situation that puts you in the middle between her and her parents without talking to her about it. So, it probably feels like a breach of trust. 

I wonder why her parents called you and not their daughter.. perhaps they already had this conversation and she said no. You should apologize, and ask if there’s more to the story."

Shame on your mother for thinking she’s entitled to your money because of “all she’s done for you”. Parents are supposed to take care of their children. Children aren’t a savings account that parents can start withdrawing from once the child reaches adulthood."
dd1pru,"YTA.  In your defense, it is your money and you have no obligation to spend $1,500 on a birthday gift, particularly if you're 23 and not married to her.  However, the fact of the matter is that your motivation here seems to be 100% selfishness.  Making things worse, if you hinted that you were going to get a certain type of gift, it's an asshole move to tease her like that and get something else.  I'm not saying that you had to get that exact necklace, but there's a huge difference between something that costs $1,500 and something that costs $40.  (I don't know the exact price, but we're probably talking about something that's at least 90% cheaper.)  You shouldn't get your girlfriend's hopes up like that if you're not capable of following through or at least coming close to following through."
dd1y34,"ESH. You’re using your children to prove a point and get back at your ex, and that’s shitty. Don’t miss something specifically for the kids because you want to be petty. She should of course tell you they have an appointment, but it can’t always be on her days."

For a long time mental health was swept under the rug and kept hush-hush, so I get where they're coming from but in this day and age it's being discussed, and it needs to be talked about openly so people know it's ok to get help.

Please forgive me if this is a bad or offensive analogy, but I'm half Jewish, and when Jewish people question that or tell me I'm not allowed to identify that way because it's on my father's side, I sometimes say, ""Well, I'm Jewish enough for Hitler."" If I'd been living in Germany during the Holocaust, I would have been subject to genocide, even though I'm not Jewish by religious rules. The analogy I'm making is that in your case, you would have been black enough for slave-owners. Sally Hemings was 3/4 white (and was Thomas Jefferson's wife's sister!), and that didn't make her free or save her from rape. You're black enough for racists. Yes, you can pass and that's going to mean you're not subject to instant discrimination on sight, but you're absolutely subject to discrimination from people who know your family or learn more about you socially or see your name on a job application, and in other ways. Every argument for reparations applies to you, for example. Ignoring all that denies the reality of your experience of the world."

Failing that practicality, I would say NTA.  Maybe your wife is feeling like she needs to do more with her life.  Perhaps you could think of something else than university."
dd404h,"NTA. 

It sounds like your friend was under a lot of stress from supporting you, and it could have been almost anything that tipped the scales for her. It just happens that this one is stupid.    
You are not psychic, so this shit aint on you, but she's probably been absorbing a lot of her own shit in favour of helping you so when that ended up being unnecessary this one time, it's like a dam bursting. 

I mean, you offered to give her the money. This could have been fixed, but that's not the problem. The problem is that she's been dropping things for you for a while and... that gets to people. People get burnt out hard without realising. 

Give her some time. Hopefully afterwards she'll be in a better place and you guys can be friends again. Though if you do, do your best to be aware that she's a ""help friend at expense of everything and also not tell that person so it doesn't add to their problems"" type and try to balance things where you can (eg making sure she talks about her problems in her life, doing things for her where you can) and try to rely on things other than her where you can. 

If you guys don't end up being friends again, Then to have a ""help friend at expense of everything and also not tell that person so it doesn't add to their problems"" type of friend is an extremely rare experience, and regardless of sadness of how it ended I hope you can still find joy in the fact that you were loved and appreciated so damned much."

But A is a strong word here.

Your mother was unwell and had to go to hospital and was probably in pain and scared. The fact that you didn't call her or even send a text meant to her that you didn't think about her.

The fact that you got the news that she is alright from somebody else means that you didn't have to worry about her health anymore, but it doesn't mean that you don't have to think about her. How would you feel if you had been the one in hospital and nobody contacts you? It's just about showing a bit of empathy. She is your mother and has surely worried a lot about you in her life and asked you many many times how you're feeling and has cared so so often for your health. Just give back a little.

Next time send a text or give her a quick call, just saying that you got the good news from her friend and that you're glad she's better and wish her a speedy recovery. It takes less than 5 minutes."

Reading your comment, this is how I'd judge it. Generally, it sounds like you have different expectations of how clean your living space has to be. Leaving house work undone once or twice a week is not a big deal to a lot of people. It's not this that makes you TA in my eyes though.


Something about how you phrase your post suggests that you think the housework is, by default, your gf's responsibility, even aside from the fact that she has more spare time than you.

Secondly, the teacher already told her she could. I know my dance teacher sometimes forgets to email me back, even if it's something I think is important. Lastly, what's the worst that could happen? If she doesn't do well then just try again at the next feis! I feel like most people commenting here don't have a full understanding of how Irish dance competitions work and the amount of control each individual has over what they dance. My teachers have actually NEVER told me which dances to take to competition, I've always picked for myself. I think it's smart to get the teachers opinion (such as if she thinks your daughter has a better chance of winning with an easier set dance) but at the end of the day it's up to her! I know how exciting it is to master a new step and FINALLY get to compete it."

He's not clueless, he's just chosen not to do the shopping & cooking (or learn how to) because he's lazy.

I understand your point. I understand why you are insecure. But if he wants to cheat, he will find a way. And it's on him, not on you.

Here's what you can do. Take a deep breath and try to be more secure in your own skin. Confidence and a relaxed attitude are attractive in anyone. Fake it till you make it, as they say, but fake it from deep within (i.e. understand that we control very little in life aside from our reactions and thoughts, and those are difficult enough - might as well smile and enjoy the journey).

Make your boundaries known and understood. I.e. you are monogamous and exclusive. Any cheating = breakup, no ifs, no buts, no excuses.

Entice him to open up to you more so that you can gradually take the others' place. Mind you, don't pressure, just offer emotional support and affection.

Other than that, you are both responsible adults. Good luck!"

Stand up to your parents and explain to them that if they are not willing to correct this behavior, you have no choice but to take matters in your own hands.

homie, I also work in construction. I am a vendor for large commercial projects like hotels and apartments. It is not unprofessional to ask the difference between the bids, especially when there is a substantial difference in price.

Dude can holler all he wants. You tell your contemporaries what he tried to pull on you and his level of professionalism. Guarantee it will have more effect than his tantrum. Also, if someone refuses to bid to you from what dude told them, you can explain how he tried to fuck you and your budget. 

Also, do your subcontracts not say that any and all work necessary to procure and install a complete system is included in the scope of work, even if not depicted clearly on plans? I get ones that say an unlimited number of mobilizations without a price increase, overtime at no charge if needed to keep up with the schedule, and all kinds of crap.

ddeqvx,"YTA so very, very much. This story struck a very harsh chord of anger within me and I'll try to gently explain why.

First off, I'm also native. I'm also enrolled but not super active in my tribe, and I *also* have a very strained relationship with my parents - so at times, aspects of my culture can be rooted in pain, and my primary connection to my people and language are gatekeeped by very toxic individuals in my life. Stories like Sarah's are not uncommon. 

I say all this to explain, as a native person, how *deeply painful* and insulting it is to pass off any kind of Christian/LDS/Catholic text as ""Native American."" It is not my history. It is *not* the story of our people, as much as your beliefs say otherwise. We have our own religions and creation myths and stories, and they're tribe-specific. Native Americans aren't a homogenous mass of people who all believed the same thing and worshipped the same gods or told the same stories or even spoke the same language. **Your religion is NOT the heritage of the Nakoda tribe**. 

As an additional layer of insult, you gave this text to a child, whose connection to his people is even more tenuous. In order to survive, our traditions *must* be passed down to the next generation. For me personally, passing down Mi'kmaq traditions and language will be difficult because they weren't passed down to me. I can imagine your coworker is probably in a similar situation. Her son likely doesn't have a solid grasp on what it means to be Nakoda, doesn't know his tribes' stories or language, at least not yet. Maybe Sarah wasn't even given the privilege of that kind of self knowledge. That can be a very alienating and terrible feeling, to know that you are connected to something that will forever remain out of your reach. 

And into that gap of knowledge, that lack of connection, you bumble your way inside, armed with only your religion and the sincere belief that you're doing the right thing and trying to help. You are *not* helping. You are *not* teaching this young boy what it means to be indjgenous, or giving him a deeper connection to his tribe or his land. Just by sending this boy home with this book, promising that it tells him more about his culture, you show how totally ignorant you are about native people and our beliefs. 

Believe whatever you want. Religion can be a very healing, wonderful, community building thing, and I'm glad your beliefs are so important to you. But *please* recognize that your beliefs are not universal and can be actively harmful to the people who are depicted in them. What it means to be LDS is not what it means to be Nakoda. 

You owe your friend Sarah and her son a very sincere apology, and you ought to take some serious time to reflect and do some research into indigenous people."

ddg585,NTA for being upset with your parents. No one likes double standards. Also its definitely worse because they aren't listening to why you are upset.
ddg6u0,"NTA. Your mothers comments are extremely inappropriate and uncalled for. She needs to be told, in no uncertain terms, that you’re no longer going to listen to her jabs about your weight."
ddg7pk,Yta. Crate training a dog isn’t unreasonable. Allowing a puppy to have free reign of an apartment isn’t safe for the puppy - there are too many things they could get into that could hurt them.

ddgeke,"""only to be told they needed a ""reason"" to quit and would not be taken off the schedule.""

You understand they can't come to your house and kidnap you and make you work, right? When they say they won't take you off the schedule, just smile, say ""good choice"" and don't show up. This is a really easy problem to solve. You literally don't even ever have to talk to them again from this point."
ddgmp9,NTA....are not little kids like dogs anyway? lol ...ur not in the wrong. At least ur not whooping asses or something. The parents need to loosen up
ddgmqu,Very obviously NTA. Where are you from that you need working papers by the way? Has the pizza place even said they’re only hiring one person? Many restaurants have multiple positions open often because they turn over workers quickly generally
ddgqa6,"I've read this a few times because I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. I can be quite sensitive (29F) and I can't see a single part of that exchange that sounded condescending. I've only ever been to one concert, but I don't know anyone who knows all of the songs for all of the bands at any concert that they have been to. I thought that part of the excitement was being introduced to new artists.

That last paragraph got my back up though. She seems incredibly insecure if she needs to threaten you with validation from Reddit.  
If she wants validation, I suggest couple's counseling where she can express herself in a healthier manner.

Edited because I forgot to add NTA."

ddhgxg,"NTA. Just because she's your mother doesn't mean you owe her anything.

You didn’t want to sit by a stranger so you made someone else do it, lmao!"
ddhz6s,NAH. She lives there so to her it really is “hardly the middle of nowhere” in a way its her whole tiny world. Makes sense that her instinct would be to defend her community.

ddi2ge,"NTA 

Follow through on your threats. The fact that they think you’re overreacting and you’re here asking us shows you don’t follow though enough. “Don’t do X. If you do X I will do (list consequences)” and the moment they do it, follow through with every part of the consequences. If you realizes later you were being too harsh you can change your mind in private. Stop letting them push you around."

It's ALWAYS recommended to let them go at it while remaining calm and once they've simmered down, talk about what they want/need. Giving in to kids' explosive tantrums only reinforces the behavior, just like you said."
ddia5x,"Nta. The kid (depending on age) SHOULD KNOW, what he can and cant eat. or at least know to ask. also the parent should stick around if he is to young not to know himself, its her job not yours. especially with 35 fcking kids around. She should have brought something for him to eat.  thats neglect on her part."
ddiao6,NTA  Sorry to tell you this but Gabe isn't your friend.  If you were his friend he would stick up for you or sit with you at lunch since he knows you don't have anyone to sit with.
ddies3,"NTA. Firstly, if only ""more than half"" the pregnancy tests she's taken are positive, she probably needs to see a doctor and have it confirmed officially. They're [accurate 99% of the time,](https://www.glamour.com/story/how-many-pregnancy-tests-do-you-need-to-take) so if she's pregnant *almost all* of the tests she takes should be positive. 

But you're not TA because her mom thought you'd gotten her daughter pregnant, and it's fair to insist that your name is cleared, especially as it sounds like her mother was expecting you to be involved, which you obviously couldn't be.

I do think you need to step back from a friendship with this girl.

That being said, I think it sounds like you really want to go to this celebration.

You have absolutely no obligation to share your story with them until if and when you are ready."

ddifuc,ESH. You both sound insufferable.
ddiivk,YTA because you very plainly sacrificed your daughter's needs for your son's. You may have loved them both equally but you certainly didn't show your daughter that.

ddiwug,"YTA

She should have given you a tip! However, a tip though expected is not mandatory and you can never request a tip. And she even told you her reply and you almost argued with her. That is out of line from a professional point of view. 

The 45 minute drive as well as the gas money should be part of your salary and not come out of your own pocket. But this is between your employer and you - the customer has nothing to do with it.

ddj61j,"YTA. in a sense, you’re entitled to give how much you want to give but I don’t think it should be based on where the wedding is held - especially not for your own family members. How much they spend on their wedding should have no effect on how much you want to give."

ddjfx6,"Um. NTA. What the heck is wrong with your sister? Because this isn’t about “the family WII”. No one played it for years. If you really care about her feelings, sit down and talk to her calmly and rationally and ask her what the real issue is. I guarantee it isn’t about an old video game system. She may be harboring some issues in regards to the divorce and the Wii May have represented the good times your family had before the divorce. Let her know she will always have the memories and memories are not stuff but the experiences th at came when you guys were all together. Nothing can take that away from her."
ddjo0k,I use the mute option on my mom. You should try it.
ddjt13,"NAH. In my dictionary, ""pocket money"" is money you spend on yourself, not ""put it aside for college spending."" While that's the responsible idea, you're young and need to learn to save. It's a good lesson. Try to budget better so you can put money aside while still buying nice things."

Just because my roommate opens them doesn’t mean she is the only one who can close them.  I always close curtains before showering or taking off my clothes.   If I’m napping or something I throw on a bathrobe.    Every dwelling has windows, and all of them are see-through.  Are you asking her to close the curtains every time she leaves the home, regardless of the time?

It sounds like you had a reasonable and good conversation about this topic.

He wanted a monogamous relationship and he said that if the roles were reversed he wouldn't like you dancing like that with another man neither.

Yes, he can be a bit sad that he has lost some of the freedom he had before he decided that he wanted this relationship. But he has realised that what he has with you is more important. You don't stop him from enjoying life. He was the one who chose to live by the rules of a relationship. Sometimes those rules can be a bother but he knows it's what he really wanted. 

And it's true clubbing when being on the prowl for a  mate is very different from clubbing when you're married. It won't be the same. But it can still be fun. Maybe he'll just need some time to adjust to this new scenario."

Depending on what you wrote, you very well could be the A here if you sent out an inappropriate email because you were justifiably angry.  You can be right and still cross the line with how you handle it, and in the end that’s all that matters.

EDIT: YTA.   You lost all of the high ground once you hit send.  To be clear, I get it - people should act certain ways in a work environment, and cleaning up after oneself is basic.   The problem is, it’s like being the guy who hits reply-all to an accidental company wide email, demanding they be removed from the list.   

But I’ve written that email before...  it was cathartic to write that email.....  I just didn’t hit send,   Sometimes I sent it to my boss or office manager, and asked them to handle it.    Unfortunately, one co-worker chastising other coworkers publicly never come off well.    What sucks is you are right, and they are acting like Mommy is gong to clean up for them.

First I'm curious why she was in your room and leaving her things behind to begin with, and why it evolved into forcing you to coming to her pictures. As what, punishment? She presumably didn't seem to care until you drank her tea by mistake, so she's threatening to pull some petty shit over it? God, i don't miss being 14.

ddlj9x,"A very, VERY soft yta.

I remember thinking graduating and prom were huge deals, and at this stage in your life *they are* but as you age, the memories will fade a bit and you'll realize they were very minor occasions in the grand scheme of things. 

In your mom's defense, being miserable at your job is soul draining, and as much as it sucks right now to not have your mom around for these momentous occasions, try to understand that she'll feel like she's a better mom when she's happier. On top of that, timing is everything to finding the perfect job. It sucks that it happened now of all times, but you can't just wait and hope you'll find something that's equally as good, or hope that the job you want will still be available later. 

I hope your mom can make it to your events, congrats on your upcoming graduation :)"

If so, the best compromise is to have a save or set of characters that you only play when you're all together. James can play his Siren whenever he wants, but his Beastmaster is only for the Squad."

But don't ask how little this woman is receiving. Instead, talk about an agreement for the handling of shared expenses. Outline exactly what these expenses are, and ask if she'll be able to contribute her fair share. Be honest about how much of these resources you expect to consume, so you don't come across as wanting to ""pay half"" when you use 75%. These things can be tough to navigate with strangers, so look for signs of maturity and respect, above all, when choosing potential roommates."

My bff owns a gym and I hang out with him and plenty of personal trainers. They know how to be encouraging, inspirational, aspirational, etc. they would never just look at some numbers and be like “you’re overweight. Solidly overweight.” Even if that were true that’s not how a good trainer acts.

Your mother isn't even trying to apologise to you. She is not trying to mend the situation, or discuss why you left and how you can solve the issues together.

ddpbrj,"Not TA for not wanting to live with them. However,  practicalities also come into it. Who is on the lease? If just you, no problem (though you probably need to give some notice).

Now, I personally think people should have a sense of humor and able to laugh at themselves in today’s culture. But you just simply can’t expect that from people, if you’re saying something offensive and it’s not YOUR party, you should tone it down a bit out of respect. And the fact that it bothers you should be a clear indicator that he should stop (hence, why should tell him)."
ddpmfa,"NAH

You’re allowed to say no to side jobs. That’s why she asked you. Keyword asked. 

She’s allowed to value certain ambition levels or mindsets when it comes to work and what she’s looking for in a partner.

You said the relationship is still pretty new, it’s probably the first time that difference in work/life balance mindsets has come up. And it’s great that you both expressed it honesty how you felt. You’ll either accept that you view these things differently and build a great relationship with that in mind, or it may be a huge deal to her and then you weren’t going to be long term compatible anyway.

But kudos for you not trying to “impress” her and saying yes and opening the door to more invites for side work and resentment. And kudos to her for saying outright that was a difference between you two that concerned her so you guys could address it. Hooray for adults."

The blind ""always support your blood"" is what ends up destroying many families and your family constantly helping him out of his troubles means he will never improve himself because why would he need to if he always has a get out of jail card.

ddpskf,"YTA if you do it confrontationally, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to just interject it jokingly. Everyone needs to take voting seriously because that’s the only way you have a voice.

Even in this post you talk about your kid visiting likes she's a friend or distant relative. 

You had a responsibility to her above and beyond anything else in this world. You don't get to just walk away from being a proper parent when you walk away from a marriage. To just put your new family first and not even try to accommodate her in some way was crazy. 

To not kick up a fuss the first summer you didn't get to spend time with her was crazy. 

To let this go on and on until she was 18 was crazy. 

To now say she's being malicious is crazy. 

Where have you shown this kid she's on an equal footing to your new life? I don't see a relationship here. Just some kid that comes to visit you occasionally."
ddr1gw,"NTA, go for it but first do some proper research.  Figure out where you’re gonna go precisely, living arrangements and what jobs you need or can land. Settlement money will eventually run out, so you’ll need a backup plan in place in case anything goes sideways with the money."

You threw clean laundry on the floor so she had to completely redo it without even mentioning it to your partner because you couldn't wait 10-20 minutes or however much longer they needed to dry? The point of you doing your own laundry is to take something off her hands, not make *more* work for her.

Also, you both work and she is at home taking care of your toddler all day while trying to do work and school, and you say ""she"" is falling behind in household stuff? So you do her the ""favor"" of doing your own laundry, even though you should be pulling your own weight anyway around the house? Good lord. Apologize to her and pick up more of the slack for your partner who is working, studying, and parenting what sounds like all the time."
ddrff5,"NTA.

Her issue is with the tenants not with you. reply as such and give her the name of the agency you let through to appear as helpful as possible.

ddrhf4,"NAH. You may want to talk to someone. Your feelings are not unwarranted or anything but they might turn into post partum depression following the pregnancy.

I don't think you're in the wrong or anything, I just think you might feel better if you talked out your feelings with someone, and you may get some advice on how to tell your husband how you're feeling, too.

>She basically said that I have to stop giving my parents money or she'd leave me,     

Ultimatums are manipulative- she is trying to control your money when you are not even living together.      
Lord knows how controlling she will get once you are.      

You get to decide how badly you want this woman in your life and what compromises you are willing to make.   
But attempting this amount of control is an enormous red flag if you ask me.  

You are a good son- don't let anyone make you feel guilty about that.   
$2k a month represents only around 8% of your income- if she is willing to walk over that then let her.  

If you marry her get a prenup- she is way too fixated on money for this stage in your relationship."

If you live in a safe area and all it’s totally fine to have him walk home on his own *if he is comfortable doing so*. You should have talked to him about this. Going on a walk and forgetting the time and forgetting to pick up your kid is an asshole move. You could have made a call to whoever was watching him at the pool, be that a class instructor or a neighbour keeping an eye out, or a lifeguard who was cool keeping an eye on an otherwise unsupervised kid. Instead you left an 11 year old alone, made him worry not knowing where you were, made him feel completely neglected and forgotten about, and it sounds like this is the first time he ever walked home from there on his own. Probably not knowing if he was in for trouble doing that on his own or not."

dduczo,"NTA. I took care of my mom for a few months when she was first diagnosed with stage 4, metastatic cancer. I’ve never been more physically and emotionally exhausted, or felt more alone, in my life. Know how many people I snapped at or engaged in arguments with? None. One has nothing to do with the other. I didn’t suddenly become prone to arguments and demanding answers to a series of questions when I’ve already been told we should take a break because the conversation is getting out of control. 

I can definitely empathize with what she’s going through. But that doesn’t excuse lashing out like this versus simply saying “that comment earlier was pretty thoughtless, and hurt my feelings”. 

Does she deserve a little extra understanding during a difficult time? Sure. But that doesn’t excuse this prolonged outburst."
dduezs,NTA - it’s shitty of him to ask you to dress up for a movie date. You’re sitting in the dark eating popcorn. Shorts and a t are standard clothing for that.
ddugdd,"NTA that's too excessive. Don't let her use your dryer and laundry anymore, unless its a big load. Tell her to go use the laundry mat like she said."
dduhcb,NTA. Rent is not maid service and any civilized  child let alone adult doesn’t owe on a seat.
ddulyn,"?? Are you being serious? I'm getting that you obviously don't see this as a big deal, but YTA as far as I'm concerned, no doubt. Picking up people's food for them does not give you a right to a portion of their food. That line of thinking is weird.

If you didn't pay for the food, you aren't entitled to any of the food. If you feel entitled to some kind of compensation for driving people their food, then ask for gas money. Stop stealing food from your friends."
dduos4,"YTA it really could be that this was always his personality but he was just downplaying and ""acting straight"" around you when he was in the closet. Same thing happened to a buddy of mine.

Until he came out of the closet two years later he is living life as a female"
dduq4e,"NTA this girl sucks and is temporary. Hang in there, it'll be a funny story about clingers once your friend can recognise all these red flags and cut it off"
dduq9i,"NAH. I don’t think you’re an asshole for needing some space from her. I can empathize moving back to parents after you have been on your own - it SUCKS. I lasted not even two weeks. She crossed a boundary, but I don’t think it was of a place of malice. While you have been the one through hell and back with your treatments and recovery, it also worried your mom to death. She shouldn’t have gone behind your back about it for sure. However, I will say this. Life is too short. My husband has about 2 years give or take to live from his Neuroendocrine cancer diagnosis. One thing I learned was not to waste one second being angry and not speaking, and to resolve problems and move on. I wish you the best in your health, cancer is a bitch, man."

ddv6m4,NTA. I’m sorry but if my husband was taking pictures lying down with girls with heart emojis then heads would roll. This isn’t acceptable behavior for someone in a committed relationship.

If he won’t then he isn’t marriage material IMHO.
ddv87a,"NTA

it seems like you've given leftovers to homeless people plenty times before.  I see many people going though trash just to find something edible, maybe one of the saddest things I've seen was a guy collecting coffee from thrown to go cups in a plastic bag. It has much more dignity to receive something knowing just one person used it rather than digging said water bottle or similar from the trash. If you live in the EU, even if the homeless person wouldn't want the water, it could make use of it due to the 'Pfand' system. So even less shame in that.
Some of the arguments of that person are valid, like spreading disease, but when you give your stiff away you know of you're sick or not, and you know your intentions are well and don't think of them as lesser for giving them your leftovers. Don't get discouraged because of that douche. 

 If the homeless person accepts it, it's okay. if they're uncomfortable they can still throw it away but the best thing is that THEY decide if it's thrown or not. Sadly deciding:'do I want this sandwich or no', 'will I drink this water or no' is not a privilege all of them have. Giving them leftovers, is giving them the option to choose! All support counts for most of them, if they don't have to spend that money they have on water or food, it's only good for them."

Sure condoms aren’t perfect, but my gut says she may be doing this to hit you up for money.

How is him pouting all day ever going to convince you that having sex with him is a good idea, when he acts like that when you turn him down? 

My husband use to pull this morning shit. I called it the poke poke. I fucking lost it on him one morning. I explained it to him like this: I could wake up in the middle of the night hungry. You are sound asleep. You make the best grilled cheese sandwiches ever and that is what I want. Am I going to wake you up to make me one? I mean, there is a chance that you may be hungry as well. We both had an early supper. But I'm not going to make me being hungry for your grilled cheese your problem when you are sound asleep. I will go make my own grilled cheese. Because I know you want to sleep, even though you also enjoy grilled cheese. I'm sure as shit not going to try and wake you up, ask you to make me a grilled cheese, then be pissed you won't, be a grumpy asshole for the rest of the day, then ask for grilled cheese for supper the next day.

ddwstd,"NAH Anxiety can be really hard to deal with and you shouldn’t feel like you need to meet up with people if you’re not up to it. However, friendship is a two-way street and you sometimes have to work to keep it going. You don’t have to hang out if you don’t want to but you also need to be prepared for your friends to move on eventually if you continue to give nothing back to them. I’d suggest letting them know how you feel so that they at least know why you’ve been distant for a while."

ddwzih,"YTA, but mostly for how you reacted when she got upset. You think it's ridiculous for her to mad about fries, but not for you to be mad. No one likes to be told ""get the hell over it, are you really that upset."" Yes she's upset; you treated her like a child instead of a partner who you respect. I'm not saying it was okay for her to take your food, but if you didn't say something along the lines of ""it really bothers me when you do that and I know you don't want a whole meal but at least order a side if you want to pick,"" then that came out of nowhere for her. Be an adult and communicate."
ddx0d6,NAH. They don't care what your next ride is. They booked you and they want the service.

ddxbyg,NTA but you may need to take the downgrade option unfortunately because it sounds like there isn't anything you can do.
ddxjv7,NTA- he gave it to you as a gift! I find it weird he would ask for it back
ddxlgc,"NTA

You’re just trying to help but I feel as if your aren’t taking your *own* mental health into consideration here. It sounds like watching your girlfriend go through this is stressful, which is completely understandable.

>I’m afraid that she will break up with me, and I know that this won’t be good for her

If she breaks up with you it’s because she decides that she’s not in the best state to be in a relationship right now, not really because of a conversation you had with her brother. That’s if she’s being reasonable."
ddxmqi,"NTA.  I’m sorry your parents have put you in this position.

In the future, could you refuse to do anything with them?  As your parents said, you’re not the parent, so don’t even try to make them act like basic humans and just go about your own business?"
ddxn24,"YTA, at 25 they cover all of your essential expenses ( food, water, clothing, scientifically backed healthcare, etc. ) and your first response is to become petulant and angry at them for not shelling out more money so you can have spa days. Like, I can't speak for surgeries at their toll on health and well-being, but this is almost comical; you aren't a child and you aren't entitled to more from them, they have done everything they can for you thus far and you need to grow up."
ddxneo,"NTA, you don't have to tell them anything you don't want to. I don't really think it would have made a difference if you had told them everything. They care more about making this about them. You are an adult and you can make your own decisions, including not seeing them/talking to them if that's what's best for you and your DH and child."
ddxote,[deleted]
ddxwlw,"ESH. It sucks when parents can only talk about their babies in the company of friends with no babies. But I also think it's a little weird that you say ""Aw, Kimmy does that as well!"" when Kimmy is *a dog.* 

Wanting to talk about your dog? Not a problem. But you're literally comparing your dog to human babies, which is going to make for pretty awkward conversation."
ddxwwz,"NTA. According to the post, you have good reason to suspect they aren’t on top of planning everything. Getting upset because you are trying to double-check about your special day would be a bit childish of your family, who probably recognize that they aren’t the best at planning."
ddxxj5,"NTA 

17 year olds aren't going to cry or randomly scream or fidget. Which is why they had that rule"
ddxxk9,"NAH - this just sounds like a bunch of people being silly high schoolers.. Brian shouldn't have shocked Katy with that question, and the whole school shouldn't have thought that she was a b-word... Sure you could've told him, but maybe he would've gotten mad at you or something worse... It's just not worth playing the game of ""I could've done better"". I'm shocked that you still care about this 9 years later when you were barely involved."
ddy1xu,NTA. She's just trying to use your mom and your mother can't see that.
ddy6v6,Who pays $2 for a pizza slice at a party
ddy7wl,"NTA. You specifically told him you didnt want the cupcake with bug on it, and he did the opposite of that and put the bug on your cupcake and not his or his friends. Of course it was just an ant but I totally see why you wouldnt want that on your cupcake especially when pregnant and barely able to keep food down in the first place that DIDNT already have bugs on it. How did he expect you to even want to eat that? 
Definitely NTA"
ddye91,NTA. You are entitled to taking your property home with you.
ddyfkg,NTA he sounds exhausting. I would suggest just writing him off as a lost cause.
ddygei,"Oh jeez. I am constantly annoyed with people asking trivial questions on this subreddit, then something like this comes up and I wish it was someone asking if they'd be the asshole if they stole their sister's hamster.

NTA but please at least leave yourself open to the possibility that your parents will be supportive. Do what you need to do to protect yourself but try to leave them the option to do the right thing.

Good luck."
ddyhgj,ESH. Why are you making your relationship a competition?
ddyke0,"NTA. He broke up with Cindy and in doing so, nothing she does is any of his business anymore. You aren’t obligated to keep tabs on his ex and report back to him."
ddym8a,NTA but your boyfriend is big asshole.
ddyrel,"NTA, it's not like you did anything bad to make the kid cry. Probably just not used to adults being firm."
ddyste,ESH Jesus everyone acted like immature idiots in this situation. Why can’t  you guys just do your own grocery shopping individually? Why do you have to go together?
ddyuzw,NTA - wtf you literally got them what they asked for
ddyx0u,"Wait...when its hot out, raising the temp on the ac will lower the electric bill"
ddyx8f,"Just sleep in the bed, let him sleep on the couch. No need to be annoyed

Edit: spelling"
ddyyq1,NAH- I think was you said was pretty passive aggressive but I don’t think your the asshole. The bathroom is really disgusting. I think you should just clean when you see something dirty and have a cleaning schedule so it doesn’t become petty and you guys aren’t not cleaning because it’s “not your mess”. It’s just shit you have to deal with when you live with other people. You don’t have to be like “hey clean after yourself” unless you know for a fact that person did that because you have other roommates that have access to that bathroom. You could have just put a group text out saying hey just a reminder to please clean up after yourself. So you don’t acuse one person in particular especially since you don’t know for sure who did it.
ddyzsv,"NAH I really don’t like the “only kids in the wedding party” idea. Either kids are allowed or they aren’t. That’s a bad idea from the get go. If they still come to the wedding, the kid is going to be there, guaranteed. Why make an issue of it and cause more stress on your big day? Let it go."
ddz0mm,"NTA, but try not to have personal biases interfere when including it in the book."
ddz80p,NTA. He is the asshole here. Taking your vehicle without asking or even telling you? Not returning it when asked? Using a different vehicle despite the fact that he has his own? NOPE! Go get the truck and hide the keys from him from now on.
ddzaxz,"100% NTA. You were incredibly clear that the gift was based on the decision to go to college. Now, what you could do is let him know that if down the road he decides to attend college, you would go ahead and buy him an updated laptop at that time. Otherwise, it's your money and no one can force you to do anything with it. Them being upset about it, and especially him feeling like he can speak to you that way, makes me feel like he was raised with participation trophies. He made a decision and there are consequences. His life and career could still work out very well but it will happen without the going-to-college gift."
ddzbeb,"YTA

The only thing Max is asking for is a warning and you’re giving him a hard time about it. The same way Max could text you and say “hey kick them out please” you could text Max and say “hey I’m bringing people over.” If you already know Max is the type to be emotional why make things worse for him when it’s such a simple fix?

Edit: a word"
ddzdhb,"YTA, by your own admission she’s like this with your straight siblings. That means she’s not being homophobic just a fussy parent. 

Also if you only came out a couple of months ago you have to give family members time to get used to it. While they might say they’re happy for you and accept you it takes a while for some people to get used to it."
ddzez8,"I think I'll go tentatively NAH.

You're not an asshole because, while everyone is different on the introvert-extavery scale, everyone still needs some alone time to decompress and reset. Perhaps you're just a person who needs a little more. There is nothing wrong with that so long as you communicate that with him. If done properly and he is still upset, perhaps this relationship isn't meant to be.

He is not an asshole because, while he is responsible with finding housing that fits his needs (i.e. power staying on), it is 2019 and I guess us as human beings are spoiled and have grown entitled to the luxury known as electricity. As a boyfriend he most certainly has the right to ask you if he could stay with you.

I think that maybe starting a dialogue regarding how much space you each need would be healthy. But clearly communicate that you so indeed like him and like where this is headed, but that staying over so much is too much too quickly. And then continue and demonstrate this by being a good SO and let this grow the relationship rather than being a roadblock in it. I know that it is easier said than done but best of luck."
ddzme2,"NTA. She will never change when everybody always take her bullshit and except her apology. Show her that you are not her ""i forgive you puppy"" and let her run into a wall."
ddzmr0,Whoosh.
ddzsrv,Nta. She could have come over and introduced herself and asked nicely to hold your child. You can't just grab someone's kid and expect them to be OK with it. Old ladies are weird.
ddzuu3,"ESH you can't run her life and you are hardly ever there anyway so you can't expect her to get permission for everything, it's her home too that she is paying for. Would you like it if she said something about your boyfriend being there? However I do agree that she could have at least told you he was staying and introduced you considering there's a chance you'd walk into your own home and bump into a strange man there.

I kind of have to wonder though considering you are almost never there why even take in a roommate instead of just moving in with the boyfriend that you stay with most of the time anyway, also does he have a roommate and has he cleared it with his roommate that you stay with him so often?"
ddzwex,"NTA

Your parents let a medication you need run out, then held you accountable for the withdrawals, and then for the effects of them punishing your withdrawals.

Just missing the medication refill is probably either neglect or an honest mistake on your parents' part.  Punishing you for experiencing related symptoms crosses the line into emotional abuse."
ddzwux,"NAH. You don't have to ""make a fuss about it,"" or ""put your foot down."" Just tell her, in a calm, non-confrontational manner, that you can't afford to buy a BHLDN dress. It's possible she'll volunteer to cover part or all of the cost. If she doesn't, that's you cue to say - still calmly and non-confrontationally - that unfortunately you won't be able to be a bridesmaid, but you'll be their as a guest, and you hope she has a happy wedding day."
ddzxjb,"Yeah, YTA. Just be upfront about what kind of friends you have and what parties you go to? You won’t let her make her own choice about whether she would want to go or not. You’ve been dating for almost a year, most people would want to introduce their girlfriend to their friends, surely, unless they think it’ll expose you as a cool drug takin’ mad lad or whatever. I get wanting time to yourself hanging with your friends in a relationship, but you’re being disingenuous IMO."
de02id,"YTA - You got caught trashing someone and you think you don't owe her an apology? Doesn't matter how you got caught, it matters that she got hurt."
de0404,"YTA

Why exactly does it have anything to do with you?  Because you had a crush on her and did absolutely nothing for years?

She was right when she told you to grow up. 

It reads like you think you are somehow entitled to her because you liked her first which is  very much a young child's attitude.  My toy I saw it first waa waa MUMMMMEEEEEE ITS NOT FAIR

Even if you had asked her out she may not have been interested in you.
A woman isn't first come first served.

you owe them both an apology tbh"
de05y6,"NTA, but consider the bigger picture. Is this a one off? If you decide to complain, go through the council not through the neighbours!"
de08us,"how’s this kid so brilliant if he’s failing the exams? NTA he was clearly not mature enough to be there but then, what’s up with his likely old enough parents that they think teachers should be sued if the child is not ready."
de09k0,"NTA. Frankly I think letting him come visit you because he ""already had train tickets"" was pretty weird. It's not ""mean"" to avoid someone you just broke up with, and it certainly isn't weird to start enforcing some boundaries now."
de0ayo,"NAH.

I'm guessing you guys are pretty young, I haven't really heard of ""monthly anniversaries"" since teenage years or maybe early 20s at latest.

You mention anniversaries being annual which is spot on, derived from ""annus"" (year) and ""versus"" (turned). Basically ""turned yearly"".

Maybe try to reframe this as a ""monthly date night"" to keep you both happy while keeping the actual anniversary a more special occasion, chances are she's just holding onto this idea as a way to regularly have something to look forward to for you as a couple."
de0ipm,YTA- lmao thr fact that u are threatened by the idea of a girl doing a better job than you... get over yourself
de0kr0,"YTA. You tried to kiss her, she wasn't interested. You publicly posted that you were lesbians, she's not a lesbian, and clearly doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. You say ""Michelle also ignored me, forcing me to gaze from afar."" Nobody was *forcing you to gaze at a woman who rejected you.* And it does sound like you were taking pictures of her. Step back.

>The last thing she said was that I leave her alone forever.
If I could, I would have clarified that I admired her...

Do not do that. Leave her alone."
de0lfy,"NTA but keep in mind depending on the strength of feelings he has for this girl, saying this may hurt your friendship more than it hurts theirs."
de0liw,"Not Enough Info — why does she hate dream catchers so much? Is it just dream catchers or does she make you take down other posters / decorations? 

Instead of being like “well I really like them,” try asking her why she doesn’t like them and empathize with her. If she has a really dumb response like “because I said so,” then I’m sorry that your mother is acting like that. :("
de0rdv,"YTA. You could have gone to the bathroom instead of making your coworkers sit in a fart cloud. That's disgusting.

It's one thing for a fart to slip out by accident, but in most cases you can hold it in till you're by yourself."
de0rgk,NTA but you are giving up a golden opportunity to just date the brother and mindfuck this dude and play out a little Edmond Dantes fantasy
de0vsn,"NTA, it's not okay she's breaking the agreement especially not if that means strange people in your sleeping area without you knowing of it. This is genuinely how people get their ass shot."
de197j,"I don't think either choice, talking to them or not, would make you an asshole, so NTA. It's a difficult situation you find yourself in and neither answer is really right or wrong, it is merely a choice you have to make. Do you confront him, and tell her, potentially causing her to break down further and him leave, or do you pretend nothing is wrong and let him go on in his philanderous ways for the sake of the sanity of everyone involved? Difficult to say. No right answers here."
de1ar9,"NTA. It could be a cultural thing where family means you have to bend over and let them treat you however they want, but not playing that game doesn't make you an ahole. If you're not close with these people, there's no reason you need to go to their parties. It'd be nice if you acknowledged the invite and sent a card or gift if you can afford it. Understand that if you don't, you're making a pretty big, possibly irreversible, statement. But that's your right."
de1iw9,"YTA, because the stuffed toy isn't the issue here. Either forgive her and move on, or accept that you can't forgive her and break up."
de1vai,"I didn’t say you should be over him, just that you can’t sit in your shared home and demand that they sit in mourning with you.

Yes, I have had a breakup. They suck. Take a class, take up running, join a meet up group, seek counseling (group or individual)."
de1y5n,"NTA. Report him. Even if he doesn't act on it ( but there's a strong chance he will) chatting shit like that is going to make people very uncomfortable and angry. It's normalising sexual assault and misogyny. He might have ideas and attitudes from the 16th century, and he can have them, but he's living in a community now and needs to learn to be polite, respectful and not an asshole. 
Someone needs to remind him this is 2019 and no-one wants to hear this crap, and that if he acts on it, he's a worthless, disgusting creep that isn't fit to be around decent people."
de1yl0,"This actually isn’t a mom problem; it’s a period problem and that can be fixed a lot easier than an unsympathetic mother can. Go to your doctor and get on medication to stop your awful periods. You can take the pill all the time (skipping the placebos) and never get your period. Also, get checked for PCOS and endometriosis because it’s really not normal to have periods like that. NTA"
de22bk,"NAH. You can dress how you like, but if they feel embarrassed to hang out with you they aren’t assholes for that. You should find friends that share or at least dont mind your passion if it’s so important for you."
de27jo, if hes really that mean cut him out he doesn't need to be apart of your friend group. There's not much point in confronting him about his attitude because it sounds like you guy already have I. The pass and he hasn't changed.
de2eaz,"NAH - I know it’s a very awkward and weird situation, but at the end of the day I think everyone is an adult here and they’re entitled to be friends with who they want to be friends with. I think it’s a little rude of your mom to not at least invite you but since she’s lonely and needs some friends I think it’s just the fact that she needs someone with some common interests to do stuff with"
de2l52,"ESH You’re TA for inserting yourself in family drama.  He’s obviously TA for not asking her first. And finally, your grandmother has had 80 years to learn how to stick up for herself.

de2non,NTA but I’d say the relationship is probably not heading anywhere if neither of you end up compromising.
de2o8l,"NTA, if you won the prize for modeling, you won the money yourself. She doesnt have any right to ask for it."
de2qdh,"NAH She’s within her rights to ask, but it’s perfectly ok for you to say no. But I’m really curious, why would you say no? You mention it would be a burden... but you’d be happy to do it if you weren’t a back up... is this more to do with you feeling left out and like a second choice?"
de2qk1,"YTA, I think you went too far to what... make a point or something? Just tell him you're not interested in going for coffee with him. The farce with the ""if you still have my number..."" thing is the asshole part."

de38ub,"NTA. I suspect that your ""friend"" is really miffed about something else, but has chosen to focus on your drummer's age. That, of course, is idiotic. You need to find out what's going on in your friend's head, or tell him/her to shut their cakehole."
de38xa,NTA. Imagine a grown woman making a 5 year old feel guilty about receiving a present.
de39to,"NTA, never engage with someone that’s got road rage. There’s no point. They aren’t there to have a debate they just want to vent anger and there’s nothing productive about that for you."
de3bum,"NTA your friend wanted to go to the park, how did she think she was gona get there. They also used two shitty excuses back to back, not seeing you does not alter the ticket price, also her fault for not seeing you much as she gave up so easily to get food."
de3c1b,"YTA. The whole bug up the ass Reddit has about ""my house/car my rules"" doesn't work in the real world. Why wouldn't you want all of your friends to have a great time with you? Why stomp your feet and dig them into the group so hard instead of just saying ""Yeah sure, this isn't for everyone"" and going with it?

You just seem like a selfish friend. I'd probably avoid you."
de3if6,"I'm going to say NAH but I do think you'd be better off if you tagged along a few times. It's not like he's asking you to join the beer league.

de3qt5,"NTA. As long as you approach the housing director (or whoever is in office) in a way that explains you aren’t 100%. In case you are wrong about the situation. My dorms would sometimes spill over onto another floor for just like one room or two if there were uneven numbers. Like, don’t be an accusatory jerk, just raise the question. If it is a squatter, it isn’t fair to the people who live there. I’m a female, but even I know how much more of an outrage this would be if some older dude was squatting on a girls floor."
de3ufr,"NAH - Except SeaWorld

Just tell her honestly how you feel about SeaWorld and then try to hang out with them before/after."
de3uxt,"> my husband is an amazing father to our girls

No. He isn’t. A parent who treats their spouse like this sets a gross example for their children. He will be actively teaching your daughters that the way he treats you is how they should expect to be treated. Your daughters will learn that it’s okay for a man to try to change them, to belittle them, to compare them to other people, to put them down, to go behind their backs, to disrespect them. That is not a good father. And if you let him keep doing this, you will tell them this is okay."
de3xvz,"NTA, many people do this exact thing. some events just aren’t for children. they knew they’d be having one i assume?!  seems like they’re just trying to get attention. not their day though."
de4044,"NTA.  Here is the thing:. You are not responsible for your Dad.  Not for how he treated you nor how he treats others.

My guess, based on the little you have shared, is that he is a charming sociopath.  And any warning you would give to a stranger would likely go unheeded.  Your dad will explain it away -- it is a stalker or estranged business partner, making up shit.

And realize that contacting the new gf involved you back in his life.

Would it be ok to notify her?  Sure, but not the caveated above.  The thing to ask:. Will you be ok with yourself not notifying her?"
de47au,"First of all, please tell me you reported the driver in that one incident. That's super fucked up.

She said it was up to me to judge my dad based on his interactions with me and it wasn't her place to shit talk based on her interactions with him. Then I finally moved in with my dad around 13 and he shit tall my mom which made me lose a lot of respect for him and eventually I told him to stfu and she never said one bad thing about him."
de4te5,"NTA, she has valid reasons for marrying Daniel. She thinks he will be a good husband and father. She has a minor crush on a coworker, that’s not a reason to wreck a relationship."
de4wgr,"NAH. 

Ultimately you get to decide who stays in your life. 

But you also need to understand that you’re 18. You’re old enough to *take care of yourself*. You’re familiar with periods, and unless they are just crazy irregular you should know when they are going to happen. A sun burn isn’t a crazy medical emergency, even though it make suck. And it would have annoyed me also all the whining you mentioned here. 

Your step mom sounds horrible. Talk to your dad about this and mention calmly how disrespected you felt that she could talk to you so harshly."
de53h6,"NAH, but buying all the tickets for the group and you knew not everyone would be able to go was a bad decision. 

If they initially said they’d go, and pay for the tickets, and now dropped out then yes, they should reimburse you for their cost. But if they don’t, consider it the price of a lesson learned that you never should have paid for anyone’s ticket but your own."

de57qh,"So you wanted mayo on your burger. They had mayo at the table. You didn't want that mayo though.

The bottom line is this: the mother is the boss. she has the ability to say “hey please don’t add my son guys” and stop tagging OP in her posts where her employees can see it. it’s inappropriate. As long as the mom goes about it tactfully and with reason, there’s no reason why anyone would be butthurt. It’s a parents job to protect their kids and make sure they’re comfortable. NTA."

You're in a weird spot because you feel partial ownership over the flat. These things happen when you have partial ownership over things. It sounds to me like you're trying your best to satisfy all parties, which is probably the right move, and it's what I (another genuine human) would probably do. However, in the future, you might wanna think about involving mom in less things, and/or letting her assert less control over your decisions. It sounds like that will provide a much needed rock upon which you can put your foot down.

Help Anna find a new flat, explain to mom that you aren't and probably shouldn't be in the property management business, because you let another human accidentally live in a roach infested zoo, and then tell her (your mom) that you love her, and ask her to take the apartment back and give you the equity you put in (the place sounds like a dump tbh, sorry).

Make no mistake — they likely won’t consider you a friend after you do this.  And it won’t be because they’re transphobic, it’ll be because you didn’t value their friendships enough to bother maintaining them.  

Instead, I suggest you send them a heartfelt message to tell them what’s up, or meet them for coffee and explain it to them in person.  They’ll either understand why you need to take some time, or they may surprise you with their support.  Lots of cis people don’t really understand and haven’t bothered to consider what it’s like to transition, and in all likelihood they have no fucking idea what you’d like from them in terms of support and social behavior or whatever.  Just tell them.  

...But, I get it, you have other shit to worry about right now and maybe you just want one less thing to deal with.  I can totally empathize with the desire to just socially drop off the face of the earth for a little while.

She’s probably going to break up with you and feels stupid for wasting her time and money on someone who is too cowardly to even make your long distance relationship real.

Your edit says SHE doesn’t want to drive that long. So you refuse to visit her in return it seems. I hope she breaks up with you. You’re way too old to be pulling this lazy little boy behavior.

This comment below you posted astounds me. 

“I can manage LD relationships just fine. Before her I was in a one year LD relationship (we never met in person, but she lived all the way in Canada) and my ex-girlfriend didn't complain.”

You absolutely don’t care to put in much effort in any relationship. You NEVER even met your ex. My bf is American and I’m Canadian and we both visit each other and it’s a joint effort. Been doing it for 5 years and starting immigration paper work now. “All the way in Canada” my ass. New gf is only one state over and you still can’t put in much effort because it inconveniences you to tell your family or travel to her. 🙄

Annnd she broke up with you and you mention it’s her first relationship to deflect. I think she gave it a chance by visiting you. You hiding her away and not staying with her and asking her to visit again on her own dome is just cruel. Learn empathy and consideration especially for a supposed loved one."

First, whether or not you want to believe it... you are taking her for granted. You guys have been dating a long time and you both love each other. It is understandable that some part of you feels like she'll definitely be around, but truth is, love just isn't enough to keep two people together. 

> not too far apart 

Second, ~~you literally only saw her once last year and you both don't even live that far away???~~ Shit dude, please buck up your game!!! How much is ""not too far apart""?

ETA: I misread, you only visited her once. Either way, I still feel you guys should meet more or go out or do something!


> she casually mentioned coming to visit me, because she has more free time, but I dont think I really want her to visit because then I’ll have to entertain her and I wont have enough time to study. 

> I don't want to do that, I just want to go home and relax

I think the most worrying aspect of these is that her coming to meet you/you meeting her doesn't give you a sense of gratitude or excitement, but that you describe it as a chore or some additional work you have to do... You don't want to go on vacations with her 

> Its not that, I just dont always know how busy I’ll be.

You're blowing off your girlfriend because you POTENTIALLY might be busy? Do you see how problematic that sounds? 

She doesn't need someone who is too busy for her but someone who would prioritise her over all this business. 

>Its not my fault I dont know when I’m going to be free.

It's a relationship, dude, MAKE TIME. Everyone in serious relationships doesn't have free time. They MAKE free time for their partners because they want to spend time together.

> plan stuff for our anniversary, stuff for christmas, stuff for birthdays.

You guys are in long distance and don't do this already? I get that some people treat their anniversaries as NBD but guys, come on, you both are young and aren't at that stage where anniversaries are just another number of the years you've spent together.

Can you tell him one on one that his threat to get custody is hurting you and talk it over with him? Also did he tell you about the drug testing and custody issues or did you find out from your mom?

dembgk,"ESH. 

She clearly wasn’t “perfectly fine” with you paying the tab, because she *left*. 

 I can understand why.  I don’t know anything about Cindy besides what you told us, but in my life, I’m the “ugly duckling”. 

( I have developed a terminal illness that seriously ravaged my looks- my hair fell out, I need to be on oxygen and wear a mask, I became partially paralyzed and need a wheelchair, and I take high doses of steroids so I’ve gained a ton of weight and 3 chins.). I don’t have the energy or ability to do my makeup, wear contacts, can’t wear cute shoes, can’t try on clothes.  I tell you this, not for sympathy, but so people don’t respond telling me “just hot yourself up/just lose weight!”. 

The way I was treated as a “pretty girl” before I got sick and the way I’m treated now are total opposites. I used to be the girl that would get into the clubs for free, and couldn’t go out without making friends and getting numbers and drinks from people.

Now I am treated like garbage.  Not just because people don’t give me free stuff, I can live with that, even though it’s a disheartening signal that I am not what people want, to constantly see other women get “prizes” for essentially, existing and looking good doing it. I understand I am not entitled to those free things. I just wish people thought I was still “worth it”,  now that I look “different”.

It goes so much farther. People are actually cruel, in the things they say and the way they interact with me. I could write for an hour about my experiences as “sick Sage”, but it wouldn’t be relevant. I have a point, I’m just long winded!

Sometimes it gets to be too much. I have to leave wherever I am, go home, and have a cry, because I feel so worthless and so...alien and ugly.  I want to crawl out of my skin and into someone else’s SO badly. 

I think Cindy may have self esteem issues that caused her to feel that way, too.

When the younger (and likely, to society, “prettier”) girls got in for free, that triggered something in Cindy that made her feel inferior to them.

She didn’t want YOU to pay - she wanted to be treated equally to those pretty young things, and to feel like she was just as good as they are, and worth just as much.

When you didn’t have her back, it was like reinforcing that the bouncer was right- they deserved to go for free, Cindy deserved to have to pay.  She wanted you to stand up for her.

In the end, it wasn’t your fault that it happened and I see both points of view. It would have been great for Cindy to suck it up and not make a scene, and just let everyone have their fun.

At the same time, if she left alone in tears, this may have been her limit.  You don’t know what her life experiences have been like, to get to this point.

She could have been more accepting of the situation. You could have been much kinder and more compassionate.

ESH but Cindy, the least.  Humans have feelings and sometimes they are overwhelming. When that happens - and/or when we feel wronged by others - we hope our friends will be there to support our struggle. 

It sounds like you were so caught up in wanting to have a good time at the club, you didn’t really care the way you should have, that Cindy was hurting.

I’m sure I’ll get downvoted for this, people will want to call Cindy an “entitled Karen” or something- but in reality, she is no less entitled than your pretty friends who got in for free. She should have gotten equal treatment.  

(I also blame the bouncer- even if you’re trying to fill your club with hotties, you don’t break up a group to do it!  Even if it was just a “so you’re not excluded”, there’s no reason he couldn’t have let Cindy in as well.)

I see no reason all of you, couldn’t have pointed that out...besides being more concerned with having a good time, than Cindy’s feelings."

You certainly don't have to go to every party, but being in a relationship means sometimes doing things you wouldn't choose for yourself.

I get his point of view. I’m a dog lover but I’ll be damned if a dog comes into my bed and sleeps with me. For one, I have a massive pet peeve about people smacking or licking their lips loudly and it goes for dogs too...and they all always make that irritating noise!!! I hate it!!

deoifi,"NTA at all, your parents are TA and your brother a soft TA. It’s like you said: you’re their daughter, putting you in the middle is unhealthy to everyone. You’re also not your mom’s friend. It sucks that she has no friends but tbh that’s her responsibility to deal with.

They could be upset with **her**. They might have a specific reason why they don't want her to go that doesn't include money, but you couldn't have known that. She expressed a need, you helped her with a solution. If they're not willing to share with their (almost adult) daughter why they are not ok with her going on this trip besides money, that's an internal problem, not a reason to be upset with you. Did the ""father with words"" explain why they're unhappy about what happened?"
depbgl,"NTA

None of the names you listed are that difficult. Just give them a simple middle name so if they hate their first name they can go by their middle name if they so decide."
depcim,NTA. There are a lot of people calling you an asshole and I just don't think that's the case here. A room full of people isn't a room you should be having sex in.
depcr0,I doubt atheists would mind a Satanist wedding byt this is a shitpost.
depeh4,NTA. Find a new gf though dude. This ones not who you hoped she would be.
depg98,NAH. Seems like they just wanted to do the project their way and we’re fine with basically having a “freeloader” which is someone who gets a free ride without doing any work. I would just be grateful because you even asked if they wanted help and they said it’s okay so if anything does happen with you being accused of doing no work just tell them you asked them if they needed help.
depivs,"NTA—I’m in Human Resources so I have a lot of experience with employee turnover and it’s totally normal. You didn’t do anything disrespectful and no normal boss would expect you to turn down a viable job offer because of their personal vacation. You did what’s best for you, they’ll hire someone new it happens all the time. 

Congrats!"
depjx7,NTA. No confirmation = no plan.  Why show up unless the other party says they're showing up?  She's making it worse by blaming you for what... not showing up to an appointment you didn't make?
depob5,"ESH

They really should ask if they know the equipment is yours. 

BUT

You can’t really leave your stuff in a shared space and expect no one to touch it."
dept9j,"NTA. He's family, so maybe you have an obligation to be pleasant with him, but you don't have an obligation to be his friend. 

I would, however, consider clearly (and objectively) explaining why he's not welcome on your new server, though. He won't get better unless he knows what he did wrong."
depwqk,"ESH. You less than tho. You're bringing up ""some bad history of gay people"" to get a rise from her and shes being in your face with her sexuality. From another LGBTQ person, its an unwinnable battle. But call her out when she uses F\*\*\*\*T. Thats a term for male homosexuals, not all sexualities and genders.

Also, Bi, Pan, and Asexual is a lot considering the last one means you aren't Bi, Pan, Homo, or Heterosexual."
depwuu,"R/insaneparents
Also NTA"
depzuv,"YTA, there’s an easy fix to this.

Have your math teacher write you a note say why you were late to class. (You’re next one)

If she doesn’t then talk to the headmaster. 

Always obey your teacher even if she is being a bit of an ass. 

Good luck bud."
deq0a8,"Sounds like you're gatekeeping to me.

She's taking a class on it; she isn't just randomly moonlighting as an EMT for funsies. You also have no idea what she studied in school or anything. You're just assuming she'd be bad based on what?

YTA."
deq0fu,"NTA - Your aunt is a grown ass woman; you're not obligated to help her with her finances.

My suggestion would be to get a sense of her willingness to cut expenses and make responsible financial decisions. If she really wants to chance, then help her. If her expectation is for you to make money magically appear for her, then tell her you're not going to help since you're not a magician."
deq2x0,"YTA. Wtf. You’ve already destroyed this woman’s life once leave her alone and deal with the mess you created. Contact the police and cut all contact with this guy, stop checking for his mails."
deq3xk,"NTA. If it were a smaller lie, maybe, but you being in a bad mood aside, that’s the cleanliness off the business at stake. Cleaning bathrooms sucks, yeah, but they can get nasty pretty quickly. He didn’t do his job, and was willing to leave it undone when he told you it was finished."
deq66z,ESH. The bouncers suck for having what’s essentially an “Ugly Tax”  (that *does* devalue women). You guys suck for not sticking by your friend who was clearly insulted and felt rightfully upset. She sucks for turning it into some huge melodrama.
deq7ih,NTA. It’s totally not your fault their dog has fleas. You’d have happily taken care of Daisy if that weren’t the case. Fleas are honestly pretty gross and a huge pain in the ass to get rid of. BIL shouldn’t hold it against you!
deqb9i,"YTA

That's fucking gross dude.  And it's a single fucking tupperware.  Just throw it out and buy more if you need to.  Your wife is pissed about 2 things now, that her daughter was eating food out of a container that once held dead rat bones, and that her husband doesn't listen to her and has zero regard for what she has to say."
deqbjf,"NAH. I hear your friend, but I think that explanation is a bit of a stretch. As someone who will always try to give someone a heads up to fixable problems (food in teeth, tag showing, etc) I wouldn’t take the woman’s reaction to heart. She was probably just embarrassed.

Small fix that *may* have made it better: just say your underwear/pants are showing instead of “your thong.”"
deqd8v,"What the fuck kind of joke is that? And why would you think an inside joke of your group would go well with his gf, who is not part of your group? Yes you're a huge asshole, from her perspective one of her new boyfriend's friends is warning her of her boyfriend being unfaithful this early in the relationship of fucking course they'd get upset. YTA. I assume your ""class"" is grade school class."
deqhb3,"NTA. 

You are a family unit and should be together on Christmas. If they want to make arrangements to visit her they can, but they don’t dictate. Your wife needs to grow a pair."
deqoyz,NTA. Your brother is 19 and an adult and can feed his own face if he’s going to run a tell your mum you didn’t feed him properly. I’d be so raging at this honestly 😂
deqsc5,"NAH. You are right that they need grief counseling, but it sounds like you do as well. A good grief counselor will help you get through this:

> Meanwhile I can't seem to turn around without being reminded of it all, my phone is still going nonstop, and I just can't seem to calm down."
deqta7,"NTA, If ive got this right, Your Mother and Aunt planned a 10 day trip for you without consulting you? 

Who is paying for it is irrelevant. Expecting an adult to drop everything they may have planned for 10 days to go anywhere without being consulted beforehand is an asshole move. Sounds more like they are treating you like a real child and just expecting you to do what they want you to do.

&#x200B;

You mentioned that your fine seeing them for a weekend. Maybe offer that as a compromise something like ""Im busy X amount of time with my time off and have plans with friends but since you haven't got the tickets yet I could come down for a weekend."" 

Your an adult though. Your time is your own to spend how you please, you don't need to compromise."
deqwla,"NTA

This woman sounds unstable and you ignoring her is the best idea. Who asks for payment for a gift?"
deqxqr,"NTA.

“Mom, I love you, but this is hard on me too, and I am NOT YOUR THERAPIST. You need to find someone to support you who is not also going through this, who is not also a part of your family.”

Siblings - “I am dealing with my own feelings about this, just like you. If YOU think you can handle being her primary source of emotional AND legal  support, you are welcome to try.  But I can’t- and you’re assholes for expecting that it’s my responsibility.”"
der0di,"NTA! 

Give him “his 10k”?! Ooooooooft someones gotten a bit too comfy and entitled living at home."
der63p,"NTA. You're being nice enough to let them continue the ""tradition."" 

As my law school professor always would tell us, nobody started their day hoping to one day end up in a casebook. 

Sure nothing is likely to go wrong, but it is something that would be super easy to draft and have signed will dramatically decrease your exposure with almost no inconvenience to the neighbors. Who I'll add once again are benefiting from your generosity."
der68p,"YTA (I think)

Look, I don't know what's happening because I can't observe him driving, but your description of his driving sounds perfectly fine to me. Driving above the speed limit (5 miles +/-) is typical. Going 20 over is not, but you don't specify what you mean by speeding. Five accidents is a tad high, but it depends on what we're calling an accident. Someone backed into me in an icy parking lot. That's an accident, but not my fault. I had a car drive directly into the side of my car when I was stopped at a red light. That was 100% not my fault. I hit a deer I couldn't stop in time to avoid...that was on me. That's three accidents and I'm in my early thirties. Five over your lifetime isn't bad. Sometimes thing are out of your control (like the car that hit me at a red light) and even the best driver can't help it.

Your description of his driving sounds highly typical to me. Perhaps that's not the case and you're just not illustrating the danger clearly, but as you put it in your post, it sounds like you're the asshole here."
der7q2,NTA - your mom is the asshole for stealing your shit and not even telling you about it
der8ie,"NTA 
I Can unterstand that you let her Plan the most things, but this song means much to you and it's YOUR  Wedding so you should be asked before changes. Talk to her in Person and everything should be fine afterwards.

Which song did you choose btw.?
Would be cool to hear :)"
derhd7,"YTA. This wasn’t a boys trip from the start. No matter what you do, if your partner is going to cheat they will cheat. Being controlling or suspicious is a turn off. I think you should trust her."
derjyr,"NTA, did she really say ""princess""?  That's very demeaning."
derlwb,"YTA for not inviting Fred. Why not just invite him, but not his gf? He hasn't done anything wrong from what I can see"
derm6t,NTA who just blocks someone midway through a conversation? its weird and kinda rude
dermqp,"No, of course NTA. The only reason you could possibly think you are is because your mom is so manipulative that she can guilt trip you at will. It’s a unique ability of shitty family members. Don’t swear her bullshit.

Sorry about your dad."
derna2,"NTA. In fact, I’d say your boyfriend is the asshole here being hyper critical of your driving when obviously you’re doing your best to cope with some post traumatic effects. Tell him to shove it. Also, I’m sorry."
dernxx,"**YTA**

When I was 16/17 my mum ""hid"" her cancer from us until she needed a ride back from surgery, then she told her boyfriend who encouraged her to tell us. 

I **screamed** my head off at her because I had been dropping hints that she was sick and needed to see a doctor for **fucking months** worried that I would have to find a way to force her to go.    
She *thought* all her clever excuses were hiding it, I was worrying what she was covering up. An eating disorder? drugs? was my mum gonna die from some weird unknown illness because she didn't want to go to the doctor? 

She was trying to limit our worry, but all she did was create more. 

Because at least when it's cancer you know what it is and how it works and that it's being dealt with. Mystery symptoms you got no idea. And that's fucking terrifying.

**Yes she will notice. just because she doesn't say anything doesn't mean she buys your shit. It's much more likely she finds the situation difficult to navigate and is unsure what to do so is acting normal while she worries and seeing if adults step in or getting evidence/advice/whatever before acting. Teenagers aren't *that* bloody dumb and self absorbed that we can't see a giant wall of bs**

just fucking tell her."
deros4,NTA they sound insanely controlling and that relationship isn’t healthy
derpj7,"What exactly is her excuse for being a full grown adult who cant puke in a toliet..and instead puking on the floor for you to clean up?
The sleeping situation i understand is hard. But if you sleep on the couch or elsehwere she just needs to learn not to take it personally, at least she has the bed and plenty of room for herself and her growing bump. 
Overall going to go with NTA, but she needs to grow up and learn to not vomit all over the place like a toddler."
derqv1,"YTA, or YWBTA. It's simply none of your business. Parents and teachers do communicate, occasionally, and he will be caught. When, where, how, and his punishment will still not be any of your concern."
des0ua,"NTA. You’re going as Daredevil who is a fictional comic book character. Not simply a blind person.. 

It would be different if you costume openly mocked people with disabilities but that’s not the case at all. I think it’s a cool costume idea. Roll with it man."
des2zq,"YTA

Sounds like you made a deal with him and didn’t let him know you sold it off to someone else. You should’ve had the due diligence to let him know the deals off."
des4ke,"ESH while she shouldn’t have misrepresented herself, it’s shitty to judge someone for their weight. Especially saying “I spend way too much time at the gym for this”"
des5g3,"NTA. THREE WEEKS is plenty of time to clean without having to be prompted. Don’t feel bad, she’ll hopefully learn her lesson."
des62t,"NTA all the way. You have to take care of yourself and it makes me sad your sister can't understand that.

And her incredible defensiveness is telling."
